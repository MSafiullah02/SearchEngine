This scheme was devised to facilitate families with immediate members (spouses and children) residing on the mainland to be reunited in Hong Kong. This scheme was operated by the mainland authorities which governed the exit of mainlanders to Hong Kong for settlement (Task Force on Population Policy 2003). This practice helped change the nature of Chinese migrants settling in Hong Kong. In 1981, 58% of immigrants were male and 42% female, but by 1991, the proportion of males dropped to 39% while the females rose to 61%. The numbers of children settled in Hong Kong increased too, rising from 30% to 40% of the total influx (Lin 1998).",

On other occasions, female migrants join their husbands before their children, so they leave children in the care of grandparents or other relatives in the mainland. This immigration policy has been accused of encouraging smuggling and corruption. Wang and Wong (1999) show their concern that many children and mainland wives, including some who were advanced in their pregnancy, risk their lives by placing themselves in the hands of \u201csnake-heads\u201d who smuggle them in for a high price.

The study by YMCA, for instance, pointed out the difficulties of young migrants in finding schools, the big age gap between migrants and their fellow students, their poor performance in English subjects, and the psychological impact associated with the admission to lower forms. Research also looked into the problems faced by female migrants (e.g. Hong Kong Federation of Women\u2019s Centre 1999). Emphasis was placed on their psychological adaptation and help-seeking patterns. The solutions, these studies recommend, were to enhance the existing adjustment programmes and to improve access to social services.",

Adjustment, from this perspective, is merely a matter of time. In addition, migrants are sometimes to blame for prolonging the adjustment problems. On separate occasions, YMCA (1995), the Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Club Association of Hong Kong (1996) and the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Kwun Tong Integrated Service Centre (2000) pinpointed that migrants were too passive and reluctant to use existing social services:New immigrants have little understanding of Hong Kong before their migration, and adjusting to all aspects of life immediately after their arrival is not a simple task \u2026 Very often, their problems were not being tackled immediately due to their ignorance on community resources. Furthermore, their low eagerness in seeking help has created even more difficulties to their adjustment of new life (p. 22, my emphasis).\n",

In explaining the income gaps, the human capital-deficit model was often cited to \u201cjustify\u201d the earning differential between established residents and new arrivals. Study by Lam and Liu (1993) suggests that, as the manufacturing sector shrinks and the service sector expands in Hong Kong, more domestic-specific human capital is required of the workers. A large portion of the human capital of immigrants acquired outside Hong Kong renders no economic value in production in the host society. In response to the challenges, the government attempted to strengthen family relationships by subsidising the integrated family service for new arrivals. Family development programmes, such as family adjustment courses, childcare services and women\u2019s groups, were introduced. Orientation programmes, for example, community orientation tours, were intended to facilitate the integration of the new arrivals into the society. Employee-retraining schemes were also promoted to assist migrants\u2019 entry into the labour market.",

Before the handover, the British and Chinese governments agreed that mainland children who were born of Hong Kong parents would automatically get the right of abode in Hong Kong after 1997. The Hong Kong government was worried about an influx of a large number of mainland children to Hong Kong after the handover, so it passed the Right of Abode Ordinance to fill the \u201cloophole\u201d in June 1997. It sets three criteria: first, only children born at the time that one of the parents became Hong Kong permanent residents enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong; second, children born out of wedlock do not have right of abodes; and third, children adopted out of Hong Kong do not enjoy the same right. Human rights activists and legal experts questioned the change of law and initiated legal action to seek clarification in the courts. In January 1999, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled that the Immigration Ordinance violated the Basic Law and right of abode should not be restricted by the time of the birth of the child.",

In June 1999, NPCSC overturned the ruling of the Court of Final Appeal, deciding that, in cases where at least one of the parents of these mainland children had obtained permanent resident status by birth or residence at the time of birth of the children, they had to stay in China to wait for the one-way permit to Hong Kong.

In his case studies, three NGO groups adopted different approaches to advocating rights. The female-only neighbourhood group in Mongkok stressed migrants\u2019 rights (also known as \u201cethnic citizenship\u201d), highlighting their status and needs as new arrivals in the host society and their demands for extra help. The against-family-violence supporting group in Tsuen Wan, in contrast, focused on the migrants\u2019 Hong Kong citizen rights, suggesting that the migrants should enjoy the full rights and responsibilities granted by the Basic Law, as the Hong Kong born did. The mutual help community-currency group in Wanchai adopted a mixed approach, celebrating both migrants\u2019 ethnic status and Hong Kong citizenship. It considered these two identities as compatible and useful in maximising migrants\u2019 control over social and political resources. Acknowledging the significance of securing migrants\u2019 rights, Wong warns that, without fully understanding migrants\u2019 subjectivities and everyday interactions, the explicit promotion of rights can have negative impact on their livelihoods. Overemphasising migrants\u2019 citizen rights, for instance, can make migrants deprived of special rights that new arrivals can enjoy. Claiming dual rights maximises migrants\u2019 access to resources, but not all migrants feel comfortable with their mixed identities. Visible collective action may also risk damaging their community reputation and social networks (p. 177).",

Ho (2006) argues that increasing female participation in the labour market does not automatically raise their social status at home and in society since martial hierarchy and male dominance in the labour market have not been tackled. Their increasing financial contributions can only enhance marital tension and their workload at home. As a result, some migrant women may \u201cprefer[s] to return to the position of subordination if their husbands were able to take up the breadwinner role\u201d (p. 237).",

The role of masculinity, fatherhood and men\u2019s perceptions of childcare is important in understanding gender interactions within families. Choi (2001) shows that the rivalry between female migrants and their mothers-in-law can have negative impact on their well-being. Wong (2001) conducted a qualitative study, interviewing nine men who married women in the mainland. He finds that men felt useless if they had to stay home to look after their young children when their wives were away. Apart from gender relationships within families, research by the Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Clubs Association touches upon the gendered living space in migrants\u2019 neighbourhoods (2004). It highlights the fact that female migrants are more likely to suffer from sexual harassment because of multiple tenure and over-crowding.",

Instead of targeting the \u201cusual suspects\u201d, such as children, teenagers, young adults and housewives, Lam and Song (2002) deliberately focus on migrants who gained places at universities in Hong Kong. They explain that researchers tend to focus on the less-advantageous migrants and the successful ones are \u201crarely researched and reported\u201d (p. 206). Ho (2006) sheds light on heterogeneity and complexity by breaking migrant couples into four types according to economics roles. They are traditional couples, dual-earner couples, working wives and non-productive husbands and families on welfare (p. 260). She examines how these different migrant couples make decisions in their everyday lives. Wong (2008) differentiates migrants by their identities and rural/urban backgrounds (see Table 37.4). The first group considered themselves as mainland Chinese with a strong rural identity. The second group has a strong Hong Kong, urban identity, and it tends to discriminate against the first group because they are largely illiterate and rely on social benefits. The third group possesses hybrid identities, and members view themselves as both mainlanders and Hongkongers. The significance of this research is that discrimination against migrants can come from migrants themselves. Merely improving the relationships between the migrants and local people is, therefore, inadequate and ineffective in combating discrimination.\n",

Wong (2007) argues that everyday cooperation by female migrants is generally not taken seriously by social workers because it does not fit into their ideal form of collective action as being visible and functional. A study by the Tsuen Wan Caritas Community Centre shows that female migrants carry out many collective activities with their friends when their children are in school (1999, p. 58). They go shopping together, chat in restaurants and visit their mutual friends. When their children are at home, they contact their friends by phone or send letters to their mainland relations. They sometimes take their children to nearby playgrounds, markets and schools where they meet friends. These activities may not necessarily be \u201cfunctional\u201d, but they are part of their collective lives. Lui and Wong (1998) therefore argue that collective action is not necessarily \u201cexplosive and confrontational\u201d. Migrants are involved in fluid communities and engaged in informal friendship networks, temporary groups and occasional gatherings. Individuals are not tied to only one community but may have multiple and overlapping bonds. The understanding of migrants\u2019 daily interactions helps demonstrate that community and neighbourhood have different significance to different groups and the relations of cooperation change over time and space across migrants\u2019 life course.",

Despite some differences among them, they tend to agree that it is a mistake to depict agency as either under-socialised or over-socialised. The former indicates the indeterminate nature of human actions and the capacity of individuals for willed and voluntary action which is not governed by social structure. It strongly believes that individuals are transformative agents who can challenge structural inequalities. The latter, on the contrary, argues that individual actions are predetermined and constrained by social structures.

These new perspectives have enriched our understanding of how migrants\u2019 experiences, in the process of migration, are constructed and negotiated. Migrants are no longer treated as a homogeneous entity; instead, they are deconstructed as many social groups with different characteristics, needs, subjectivities and constraints. Research has become more sensitive to multiple realities of their lived experiences and everyday lives. The new perspectives also remind us not to take the migrant \u201cfamilies\u201d for granted. Family is not necessarily a haven for migrants but a site of struggle and contestation (Ku and Pun 2004). Migrant research has become more sensitive to the influence of locality. New research methodologies, such as ethnography and participatory action, and new methods, such as photovoice and community map drawing, have been experimented with in order to engage and empower the migrants.

This, however, does not mean that they are mutually exclusive, and the boundaries among them are clear-cut. Social capital studies, for example, consider both the role of gender and social networks in access to migrants\u2019 citizen rights (Wong 2008). It is also not the intention to create a false impression that the three new perspectives have now got the upper hand while the social adjustment agenda focus on migrant families and quantitative approach to migrant studies has lost their influence. The fact, however, is not so clear. Ngau Tau Kok Caritas Community Centre (2001) sticks to the information-deficit model and produces booklets about the sources of social services for migrants. Hong Kong Integrated Family Services for New Arrivals Project (2005) still consider the \u201cmigrant family\u201d as the focus of their service provision (p. 4). These examples show that the old and new perspectives are constantly competing. It is too early to judge which perspectives are more influential than the others.",

First of all, there is a lack of longitudinal research (both quantitative and qualitative) on migrants\u2019 lived experiences. He (2006) has offered a good example, but the length of his observations only lasted for 12 months. This is obviously inadequate for understanding how time and space affect migrants in the process of adaptation. The research funding bodies are advised to create a favourable environment by offering longer term research contracts, such as what the UK and the EU are implementing. Secondly, while ethnography has become more and more popular in migrant studies, researchers need to expand the sites of investigation. After obtaining consent from migrants, researchers can scrutinise migrants\u2019 private and public life and follow them to go back to their hometowns in the mainland. This enables us to observe social interactions with kin and friends and that is useful to analyse the dynamics of the cross-border exchange.",

They came to Hong Kong for family reunion and have benefited from receiving higher education in Hong Kong. We, however, do not know a great deal about whether these highly educated, second-generation migrants can effectively represent the needs of poor migrants. Lastly, the current debate on gender and social capital tends to sidestep the role of children. This is related to an assumption that children are dependent and passive, and therefore, their agency is neglected. More research is needed to examine their \u201cparadoxical\u201d role\u2014while their presence helps their parents to socialise with others in parks, schools and clan associations, they can have a negative impact on their parents\u2019 social capital by refusing to return to China or participate in public events.",
