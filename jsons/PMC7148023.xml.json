However, Recommender Systems (RSs) may help in the discovery of compounds, for example, by suggesting items not yet studied by the researchers. One challenge in this field is the lack of available datasets with the preferences of the researchers about the Chemical Compounds for testing the RS. More recently, alternatives have emerged with the development of datasets consisting of data collected from implicit feedback. Unlike what happens with other datasets, for example, Movielens [6], these datasets do not contain the specific interests of the researchers. Instead, this information is extracted from the activities of the researchers, for example, through scientific literature [3, 15].",

CF approaches cannot deal with new items or new users in the system, i.e., items and users without ratings (cold start problem). CB does not need to deal with this problem for new items, and that is the main reason Hybrid RSs (CF + CB) exist. One of the tools used by CB are ontologies [27], which are related vocabularies of terms and definitions for a specific field of study [2, 28]. Some examples of well-known ontologies are the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI)1 [7], the Gene Ontology (GO)2 [4], and the Disease Ontology (DO)3 [21].",

They calculated the similarity, not between the ratings of the users, but based on the interest scores derived from the ontology. The CF method used was the k-nearest neighbours.

Semantic similarity allows measuring how close two entities are in a semantic base. When using ontologies, the semantic similarity may be measured, for example, by calculating the shortest path connecting the nodes of two entities. DiShin allows to calculate three similarity metrics: Resnik [19], Lin [13], and Jiang and Conrath [10]. For this work, we used the Lin metric. We intend to test the other metrics in the future.\n",

From the vast range of metrics for evaluating recommender algorithms, we selected Classification Accuracy Metrics (CAMet) and Rank Accuracy Metrics (RAMet). CAMet measure the relevant and irrelevant items recommended in a ranked list. Examples of CAMet are Precision, Recall, and F-Measure. RAMet measure the ability of an algorithm for recommending the items in the correct order. Some well-known RAMet are Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain (nDCG), and Limited Area Under the Curve (lAUC), a variation of AUC [22]. All the selected metrics range between 0 and 1, and values closest to 1 are better. For the segmentation of the dataset, we used a cross-validation approach, by splitting users and items in 5 folds. Each iteration had 1/5 of the users and the items as test and 4/5 as train data. All the positive ratings in the test set are considered as relevant items. We considered the unrated items as negative ratings, i.e., not relevant for the users.\n",
