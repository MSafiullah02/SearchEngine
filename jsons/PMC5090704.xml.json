Known as virus cofactors, these are host molecules that are commandeered by the virus in order to promote efficient infection 1. To prevent virus takeover, cells express a battery of antiviral effectors that repress viral replication at multiple stages. These proteins make up the cell\u2010intrinsic innate immune response and are also known as host restriction factors. The establishment of a hostile intracellular environment sets the stage for ongoing host\u2013virus coevolution, a phenomenon that is particularly well characterized between primates and lentiviruses 2.

IFITM genes are present among a wide range of vertebrate animal species, and they may have originated in early unicellular eukaryotes via horizontal gene transmission from a bacterium 4. Since then, expansions within genomes have given rise to unique IFITM gene repertoires that vary at the level of sequence and copy number.

We showed that IFITM proteins, in particular IFITM3, block the spread of HIV\u20101 from infected to uninfected T cells. Surprisingly, this function was primarily the result of interactions occurring between IFITM3 and virus in the infected cells. We found that IFITM3 in the virus\u2010producing cell decreases virion infectivity at the level of virus\u2013cell fusion and that IFITM3 becomes incorporated into nascent virions. This mechanism of antiviral function may apply to other lentiviruses as well as diverse families of enveloped viruses. Therefore, IFITM proteins are restriction factors of increasingly broad scope.",

In fact, IFITM3 can be observed at many different subcellular compartments and its localization is regulated by various post\u2010translational modifications 25. The fate of IFITM3 is governed by phosphorylation 16, 26, ubiquitination 27, palmitoylation 27, 28, and methylation 29. These regulatory processes impact the localization and turnover of IFITM3 in the cell, and as a result, they are critical to its antiviral function. During biosynthesis, IFITM3 protein is trafficked to the plasma membrane and endocytosed. This latter step is driven by an internalization motif (Yxx\u03a6, YEML in human IFITM3) that is recognized by the \u03bcB unit of the AP\u20102 complex, resulting in the sorting of IFITM3 into late endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes 26, 30. Furthermore, an overlapping motif (PPxY, PPNY in human IFITM3) recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 to promote IFITM3 ubiquitination and turnover via lysosomes 31. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 20 (Y20) common to the two motifs inhibits both endocytosis and ubiquitination, causing an accumulation of IFITM3 and redistribution to the plasma membrane 26. Mutation or deletion of Y20 produces a similar effect 30. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12252\u2010C) in human IFITM3 is predicted to produce an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a protein lacking these two regulatory motifs. This putative truncated form of IFITM3 (\u03941\u201321) is largely confined to the plasma membrane when expressed in cell lines 16. Intriguingly, rs12252\u2010C is associated with severe outcomes following IAV infection 20, 32, 33, 34. These epidemiologic studies coincide with in vitro experiments showing that IFITM3 \u03941\u201321 fails to accumulate in the endosomal compartment, where IAV undergoes pH\u2010dependent fusion to access the cytoplasm. However, endogenous expression of the putative truncated form of human IFITM3 has not been demonstrated to date. While these previous reports reveal how synthetic mutations in IFITM3 affect the restriction of RNA viruses such as IAV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), it remains unclear how they may regulate the activity against other viruses with different cell entry strategies. Furthermore, very little is known about natural, genome\u2010encoded mutations that may affect IFITM function in diverse animal species.",

Given that the amount of IFITM3 at the cell surface most likely dictates its ability to restrict HIV\u20101 entry and the infectivity of nascent budding virions, we hypothesized that post\u2010translational modifications affecting cell surface association will impact the activity of IFITM3 against HIV\u20101. Here, we report that endocytosis and ubiquitination are negative regulators of IFITM3 anti\u2010HIV activity. Furthermore, we show that post\u2010translational regulation of IFITM3 may result in a functional trade\u2010off: alterations that improve the function against one virus can inhibit its activity against other viruses. As a testament to their functional importance, periodic diversification of residues within the two regulatory motifs of IFITM3 is observed during primate evolution, resulting in variants with different potency and specificity. Finally, our multifaceted analysis has allowed us to retrace the origins of IFITM in primates and provides an explanation for the recurrent gene duplication observed in this antiviral gene family.",

Consistent with its enhanced localization to the cell surface, which also serves as the site for virus assembly and budding, the \u03941\u201321 variant exhibits increased levels of virion incorporation relative to full\u2010length IFITM3 (Fig 1E). Importantly, viruses produced in the presence of the \u03941\u201321 variant are further reduced in virion infectivity when incubated with fresh SupT1 T\u2010cell targets, as evidenced by reduced virus\u2013cell fusion at 4 h (Fig 1F) and reduced productive viral infection at 48 h (Fig 1G). Virus produced in the presence of MxA was used as an additional negative control. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirms that surface\u2010associated IFITM3 can be localized to sites of HIV\u20101 budding tagged by the presence of mature Gag protein (Fig EV1B). Results with an IFITM3 mutant encoding a single residue deletion at position 20 (\u0394Y20) reproduced those of \u03941\u201321, strongly suggesting that the tyrosine residue and the two overlapping regulatory motifs to which it belongs are crucial to the enhancement of anti\u2010HIV activity observed (Fig EV1C\u2013E). Thus, the extent of inhibition of HIV\u20101 infectivity is associated with cell surface localization and the increased detection of IFITM3 in virions. We previously demonstrated that IFITM1, which naturally lacks the amino\u2010terminus present in IFITM3, only modestly restricts HIV\u20101 infectivity 21. Thus, the absence of an amino\u2010terminus per se is not sufficient to enhance anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity. Rather, IFITM3 contains other intrinsic determinants that enable a potent HIV\u20101 restriction that can be amplified by the removal of its amino\u2010terminus.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed previously published results 16 showing that \u039417\u201320 is enriched at the cell surface (Fig 1H). Similar to \u03941\u201321, the \u039417\u201318 mutant exhibits slightly elevated protein levels relative to full\u2010length IFITM3. Importantly, the \u039417\u201320 variant does not share this feature, and it is even expressed at lower levels relative to full\u2010length IFITM3 (Figs 1I and EV1F). Both the \u039417\u201318 and \u039417\u201320 variants display an increased propensity for virion incorporation, with the mutant in which endocytosis is disrupted (\u039417\u201320) showing the greatest phenotype (Fig 1J). Consistently, the \u039417\u201320 variant demonstrates the most profound inhibition of HIV\u20101 particle fusogenicity (Fig 1K) and infectivity (Fig EV1G). Therefore, the enhancement of IFITM3 antiviral activity is associated with its subcellular localization and is not solely dependent on protein levels. When we employed a L23Q mutant to inhibit protein endocytosis 26 without disturbing the NEDD4\u2010binding motif, we found that this single amino acid change also results in more pronounced restriction of HIV\u20101 infectivity relative to wild\u2010type IFITM3 (Fig EV1H and I). These results collectively suggest that motifs interacting with endogenous NEDD4 and AP\u20102 act in an additive fashion to negatively regulate the anti\u2010HIV activity of IFITM3.",

The co\u2010expression of NEDD4 resulted in lower levels of IFITM3 in cell lysates, an effect that was not observed for the catalytically inactive NEDD4 mutant C867A (Fig EV2A). These results confirm that NEDD4\u2010mediated ubiquitination accelerates the turnover of IFITM3 31. Moreover, NEDD4 co\u2010expression diminished the levels of IFITM3 incorporated into HIV\u20101 virions (Fig EV2A). In contrast to its typical expression pattern in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that IFITM3 becomes mostly intracellular in cells co\u2010expressing NEDD4, but not in those with inactive NEDD4 C867A (Fig EV2B and C). NEDD4 induced the accumulation of IFITM3 in large vesicular compartments that partially colocalize with LAMP1 (Fig EV2D). In contrast, protein levels of the \u03941\u201321 variant in cell lysates or in virions were unaffected by NEDD4, and the localization remained predominantly cell surface oriented (Fig EV3D). Collectively, these findings suggest that NEDD4 regulates IFITM3 levels in cells producing HIV\u20101 and thus may regulate its antiviral effect. They also highlight how variants of IFITM3 missing key elements of the amino\u2010terminus may confer escape from NEDD4 and lead to enhanced antiviral function in the cell.",

Following Dox treatment of these cells, expression levels are uniform and full\u2010length IFITM3 localizes mostly to the cell interior, while the \u03941\u201321 variant is predominantly found at the surface (Fig 2A), mirroring the results in 293T cells. Importantly, we observed the induction of higher levels of full\u2010length IFITM3 compared to the \u03941\u201321 variant in its respective cell line (Fig 2B). Using this T cell\u2010based system, we tested the relative antiviral potential of IFITM3 in both donor and target cells. We produced virus in the presence or absence of IFITM3 variants and subsequently infected target T cells in which IFITM3 variants were induced or not. As previously reported 21, IFITM3 restricts HIV\u20101 infection within donor and target cells in an additive fashion (Fig 2C). However, the \u03941\u201321 variant exhibits superior antiviral activity at both stages, such that infection is almost completely blocked when it is present in both donor and target cells (Fig 2C). These data demonstrate that removal of the amino\u2010terminus enhances both antiviral functions fulfilled by IFITM3 during HIV\u20101 infection. Despite the relatively lower level of protein induction in this system, and in agreement with its localization at the cell surface, the \u03941\u201321 variant is enriched in virions (Fig 2D). Importantly, we did not detect IFITM3 in supernatants from noninfected cells, strongly suggesting that the majority of signal detected originates from within virus particles 21 (Fig 2D). Nonetheless, because IFITM proteins can also be found in exocytic vesicles 36, we performed density gradient purification of virions produced in the presence of full\u2010length IFITM3 and the \u03941\u201321 variant. As previously reported 21, full\u2010length IFITM3 co\u2010sediments with HIV\u20101 Gag protein and is nearly absent from fractions containing lower\u2010density microvesicles, and the pattern was similar for \u03941\u201321 (Fig EV3).",

However, and consistent with our previous publication 21, the induction of IFITM3 or the \u03941\u201321 variant did not affect gp120 levels in virions produced in T\u2010cell lines (Fig 2D). To explore further the effect of IFITM3 on HIV\u20101 Env in virus\u2010producing cells, we co\u2010transfected 293T cells with HIV\u20101 pNL4\u20103 and titrating amounts of plasmid encoding IFITM3, the \u03941\u201321 variant, or MxA. We observed that gp120 levels were slightly reduced only at the highest level of IFITM3 overexpression (Fig 2E). The \u03941\u201321 variant reduced gp120 levels somewhat further in a manner consistent with its elevated expression, while MxA overexpression had no effect. Interestingly, we also found that reduction in gp120 was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in HIV\u20101 p24 levels, possibly suggestive of a global effect on virus translation (Fig 2E). Therefore, while IFITM3\u2010mediated restriction of HIV\u20101 infectivity may involve Env antagonism, this effect is cell type dependent and expression level dependent. We propose that the mechanistic basis for IFITM3 antiviral function against HIV\u20101 lies primarily with its cell surface localization, which is associated with its incorporation into virions budding from the same compartment.",

Experimental approaches combining in silico genomic analysis and in vitro or in vivo infection assays have revealed that primate immunity genes, such as APOBEC3G, TRIM5, tetherin, and SAMHD1, are undergoing adaptive evolution in ways that impact lentiviral infections 37.

To build a comprehensive understanding of IFITM evolution in primates, we used comparative genomics to identify IFITM genes from full reference genomes. Aided by the Genomicus toolkit 39 and the Ensembl gene database (www.ensembl.org), we characterized the IFITM locus in simian and prosimian primate species. Simians consist of haplorhine primates, including hominoids (humans, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon), Old World Monkeys [rhesus macaque, olive baboon, and vervet monkey (African Green Monkey)], and New World Monkeys (common marmoset), while prosimians consist of strepsirrhine primates (mouse lemur and bushbaby) as well as a Tarsiiforme relict species (tarsier). This analysis yielded several novel insights into IFITM evolution. First, the \u201ccanonical\u201d IFITM gene locus found in humans is atypical with regard to gene number and gene composition. For example, the IFITM locus of the prosimian bushbaby species is syntenic with that of humans, but it does not contain IFITM1 or IFITM2. Instead, it contains two adjacent copies of IFITM3 resulting from gene duplication (a third copy of IFITM3, also the product of gene duplication, is located on a separate chromosome) (Fig 3A). In fact, while the last common primate ancestor (LCPA) is predicted to contain only three IFITM genes, primate evolution is punctuated by IFITM gene gain and gene loss events (Fig 3B). Many of the modern primate genomes analyzed show evidence of IFITM3 gene duplication, while the tarsier contains only a single IFITM gene, and it is IFITM3 (Fig 3B). The number of IFITM3 genes listed for each species is a minimal estimate, as we only considered IFITM3 sequences predicted to be protein coding by Ensembl (sequences containing an intact open reading frame and lacking premature stop codons). These data suggest that IFITM3 is the oldest of the IFITM family members with known antiviral activities. Furthermore, the genomes of hominoids (apes) revealed that IFITM2 is a relatively recent genetic innovation specific to humans, chimpanzee, and gorilla (Fig 3B). Overall, the evolutionary trajectory of IFITM in primates suggests a recurrent need for functional diversification.",

From these combined analyses, we compiled an alignment of IFITM3 coding sequences and performed phylogenetic reconstructions (Fig 4A and B, and Appendix Fig S1). Notably, our analysis uncovered recurrent mutation in the amino\u2010terminus of primate IFITM3, including many examples found in the motifs controlling ubiquitination and endocytosis (selected examples shown in Fig 4A). IFITM3 sequences from prosimians demonstrate that these motifs were likely intact in the common ancestor of all primate species (Fig 4A). However, each one of the strepsirrhine species contains two IFITM3 genes in their respective IFITM locus, and one copy of each pair contains mutations that disrupt motifs for ubiquitination and/or endocytosis. This finding suggests that a tandem duo of IFITM3 genes with potentially divergent functional properties has evolved independently on multiple occasions. Meanwhile, similar observations were made in simian species. It was previously recognized that the marmoset monkey genome contains dozens of IFITM3 sequences in its genome 38. Interestingly, the array of 25 IFITM3 variants present in this species carry many iterations of mutations or deletions that disrupt the motifs necessary for interaction with NEDD4 and/or AP\u20102 (Fig 4A and Appendix Fig S1).",

This latter species contains an IFITM3 that is syntenic with human IFITM3 on chromosome 11 and contains a P17L mutation. Phylogenetic analysis of primate IFITM3 showed branching patterns that reproduce major taxonomic groups, with a few exceptions (Figs 4B and EV4A). While IFITM3 from prosimians clearly represents the basal clade, some IFITM3 sequences found in gorilla, vervet, and orangutan genomes form two outlier branches (in gray). These sequences appear to predate other IFITM3 sequences found in the same species, suggesting that they most likely represent duplication events that took place in simian ancestors. Importantly, the maintenance of these sequences in multiple species until present day may indicate that they retain functional importance (Figs 4B and EV4A).",

Transfection into 293T cells and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that \u039422\u201324 resulted in a shift to the cell surface (Fig 5A). Predominant plasma membrane staining was also observed for marmoset\u2010specific IFITM3 mutations, reiterating an effect on protein endocytosis through ablation of the AP\u20102\u2010recruiting motif (Fig 5A). As expected, primate mutations in the NEDD4\u2010binding motif (P17L found in orangutan and P18H found in vervet) did not grossly affect the subcellular localization of IFITM3. To assess the extent to which each variant could be ubiquitinated in cells, we immunoprecipitated IFITM3 from cells co\u2010expressing NEDD4 or catalytically inactive NEDD4 C867A. In agreement with a previous report 31, ubiquitinated forms of human full\u2010length IFITM3 can be detected following the overexpression of NEDD4, while the \u03941\u201321 variant (which lacks the NEDD4\u2010binding motif) was less ubiquitinated (Fig 5B). The P17L and P18H mutations also led to lower levels of ubiquitination, especially pools modified with two or three ubiquitin moieties (as indicated by ** and ***, respectively). The IFITM3\u2010specific antibody used here recognized all but the \u039422\u201324 variant. We confirmed the presence of ubiquitin using an antibody capable of recognizing mono\u2010 and polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig 5B, colored image). The direct labeling of ubiquitin showed that the \u039422\u201324 variant is modified by NEDD4 to an intermediate extent, since it contains an intact NEDD4\u2010binding site yet lacks one nearby lysine residue. Ubiquitination was also detected in the presence of catalytically inactive NEDD4 C867A, albeit at lower levels (Fig 5B). These results reveal that the natural P17L, P18H, and \u039422\u201324 mutations prevent normal protein ubiquitination not only by ectopic NEDD4, but also by endogenous E3 ligases in 293T cells. Examination of whole\u2010cell lysate fractions confirmed the expression of all IFITM3 variants (Fig 5C). In accordance with the degree of ubiquitination observed in the immunoprecipitated fractions, certain NEDD4\u2010sensitive variants of IFITM3 were detected at lower levels (relative to the inactive NEDD4 C867A control). Notably, these naturally occurring mutations that disrupt subcellular localization (Fig 5A) and/or diminish NEDD4\u2010mediated ubiquitination (Fig 5B) also exhibit enhanced restriction of HIV\u20101 virion infectivity relative to full\u2010length human IFITM3 (Fig 5D).",

To measure the functional impact of IFITM3 variation in both of its antiviral roles, we tested the ability of primate IFITM3 variants to inhibit HIV\u20101 entry when expressed in uninfected target cells.

In line with previous findings 9, we confirmed that IFITM3 is a more potent inhibitor of IAV compared to IFITM1 and IFITM2 (Fig EV5C). While human IFITM3 restricts IAV infection by nearly 50\u2010fold, \u0394Y20 and the \u03941\u201321 variant are markedly less active (Fig 5F), consistent with previous studies 20.

However, our description of natural mutations in primate IFITM3 sequences offers only a first glimpse at the potential variation that exists. It was previously reported that the IFITM3 locus is duplicated or polymorphic in the rhesus macaque and the African Green Monkey 18, 41. Due to a lack of complete genome sequences, we did not assess IFITM3 variation in additional members of the primate family Cercopithicinae, which comprises most of the monkey species that naturally harbor SIV (and other virus) infections in the wild. Previous reports have demonstrated that these species carry adaptive mutations in restriction factor genes APOBEC3G 42, 43, SAMHD1 44, and TRIM5\u03b1 45, 46, which impact lentivirus infection in vitro and in vivo. Thus, cloning of further IFITM3 genes in diverse species is warranted and may reveal other instances of functional diversification. Future experiments focused on the NEDD4\u2013IFITM3 interaction need to be performed in cells from different tissue types and from different species. For example, while we show that certain primate genomes contain IFITM3 genes in which the NEDD4\u2010binding site (PPxY) is altered, experiments were performed in human cells (and thus with human NEDD4). It is unknown whether NEDD4 from different species targets the same structural motif as human NEDD4. The prospect that NEDD4 E3 ligases in different species exhibit different substrate specificities is improbable, however, because the NEDD4 homolog in yeast, Rsp5, also targets substrates bearing the same PPxY signature 47. A departure from this expectation would be exciting, however, since species\u2010specific NEDD4 activities may be indicative of coevolution between NEDD4 and its cellular substrates in a novel form of genetic conflict 37. Similar questions regarding the cell\u2010 or species\u2010specific function of the endocytic adaptor complex, AP\u20102, must also be addressed.",

On the contrary, we report here that these and other mutations to the amino\u2010terminus of IFITM3 retain and even enhance antiviral function during HIV infection. Furthermore, the use of these hyperactive mutants allowed us to assess the involvement of two distinct, but not mutually exclusive, mechanisms underlying this restriction activity: (i) IFITM3 incorporation into viral membranes and (ii) inhibition of HIV\u20101 Env maturation and virion incorporation. While our results in 293T cells show that IFITM3 overexpression can lead to slightly decreased gp120 levels in virus\u2010producing cells, as proposed by Yu et al\n23, we do not observe this phenomenon when IFITM3 is induced in T cells. Previously published studies illustrating an effect of IFITM proteins on the synthesis and maturation of many lentiviral proteins 48, including Gag 17, and even other cellular proteins 49, raise the possibility that IFITM proteins, when overexpressed, promote wholesale changes that may affect protein trafficking in general. Furthermore, an HIV\u20101 Env\u2010specific effect on restriction activity cannot explain the finding that VSV\u2010G pseudotyping of virions produced in the presence of IFITM proteins does not rescue their infectivity 22.

The recurrent appearance of similar mutations in different primate lineages may reflect the presence of a common selective pressure in the past and may even reveal the nature of the selective pressure itself. Our results suggest that certain nonhuman primate IFITM3 may exhibit greater activity against HIV\u20101, suggesting that evolution may have fine\u2010tuned their function against lentiviruses or other viruses entering and exiting from the cellular plasma membrane. Future studies examining the activities of primate IFITM3 proteins against their autologous SIV strains will be important for confirming their anti\u2010lentiviral potential and may reveal viral countermeasures that allow antagonism or evasion of IFITM proteins. Regardless, this enhancement of function against lentiviruses comes with a loss of activity against other viruses entering at endosomes, like IAV and VSV. Considering that IFITM3 is critical to the antiviral response to IAV in mice and humans 19, 20, the appearance of mutations in nonhuman IFITM3 that suppress this activity is surprising. Thus, our observation that many primate genomes contain multiple IFITM3 genes may reflect an evolutionary mechanism to provide balanced antiviral protection to the cell.

Residues bolded in red highlight nonsynonymous substitutions that disrupt canonical motifs for the recruitment of NEDD4 and AP\u20102. A complete protein alignment of all IFITM sequences analyzed in this study is available in Appendix.A phylogenetic gene tree (cladogram) indicates the relationship among IFITM3 sequences analyzed in this study. The final consensus tree was made by merging results from neighbor joining and maximum\u2010likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions using both nucleotide and amino acid sequences in Ensembl (see Fig EV4 for robustness measurement by Bayesian inference). Branch lengths are normalized and arbitrary. The size of triangles at the tree tips roughly corresponds to the number of sequences contained therein. Note that the IFITM2 gene is the most recent member of the IFITM locus, appearing only in humans, chimpanzee, and gorilla genomes.A graphical representation of naturally occurring truncated forms of IFITM3 identified in the vervet and marmoset reference genomes, as compared to the putative \u03941\u201321 variant in humans.\n",
