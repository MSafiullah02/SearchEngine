A different though comparable challenge involves how strategies can be executed across whole organizations. The dependence of successful strategizing on the effectiveness of implementation is rather self-evident (Hrebiniak, 2006). Organizations across all economic sectors face the challenge of achieving consistent strategy formulation, and without effective implementation will struggle to reach their intended targets (Brenes et al., 2008). Superior performance will only be achieved when strategies are effectively implemented. While strategic planning has been one of the most commonplace tools in management (Wolf & Floyd, 2017), implementation related problems (Verweire, 2014) have frequently impeded its effectiveness",

However, challenges remain despite this considerable scholarly output. Strategy implementation is multi-faceted and encompasses a multitude of activities that are undertaken by different levels of management (Noble, 1999). The multi-dimensional nature of the implementation concept has opened up alternative paths of investigation and has led to a fragmentation of the research domain (Yang et al., 2010). In parallel to the developing literature, practitioners have been embracing new approaches to strategy implementation, thereby adding complexity and indiscipline to the existing knowledge base (Vaara & Whittington, 2012). As the body of knowledge has continued to grow, there has been an increasing need to consolidate and organize the sum of scholarly insights (Kunisch et al., 2018)",

They follow carefully defined steps to reveal the research territory, thereby creating the opportunity to provide a more comprehensive view of the relevant phenomenon. The authors identify the current state of the literature and any potential gaps which merit consideration. To address the second research question, we classify the articles according to their position in the research life cycle, using a framework proposed by Edmondson & McManus (2007). This approach provides a basis for assessing the maturity of strategy implementation studies in hospitality and tourism. It also allows for the identification of research avenues that merit closer attention. To answer the third research question, we combine our results from the other research questions and identify several potential research directions that can address gaps in current knowledge.",

Through such means, review studies play a critical role in guiding future research (Cropanzano, 2009). Furthermore, an increasing number of scholars have drawn attention to the importance of literature reviews to management which acknowledgment which acknowledges a base of evidence (Rousseau et al., 2008; Rynes & Bartunek, 2017). Briner et al. (2009) have noted that systematic literature reviews are particularly valuable forms of evidence-based knowledge which can inform policy makers and practitioners. In this regard, our study makes several prospective contributions to hospitality and tourism knowledge. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, it is the only literature review conducted over the past two decades on the subject of strategy implementation in hospitality and tourism. Given the crucial role of strategy implementation in achieving performance outcomes (Hrebiniak, 2006; Brenes et al., 2008), examining how the literature has developed over an extended timespan has important scholarly and managerial implications. Second, our review is the first to assess strategy implementation research according to its position in the research life cycle. This approach reveals which parts of the strategy implementation literature in hospitality and tourism may be viewed as nascent, intermediate and mature respectively, thereby opening up the prospect of new debates about future directions. The research life cycle approach also helps us recognize the studies that are most likely to contribute to future advances in the field. Thirdly, this study identifies gaps in the literature in terms of content and methodology by outlining a comprehensive map of the relevant domain. The review highlights potentially fruitful avenues for research.",

The attendant tension suggests a need to reach closer agreement. To date, some authors have adopted a managerial perspective as a basis for defining the term. Barrick et al. (2015), for example suggested that implementation concerns the willingness of senior management to \u2018specify and pursue strategic objectives, and to adopt clearly defined metrics to dynamically monitor progress\u2019 (p. 118). Along similar lines Schaap (2006), defined strategy implementation as \u2018those senior-level leadership behaviors and activities that will transform a working plan into a concrete reality\u2019 (p.14). Other studies have attempted to provide a more comprehensive view of strategy implementation, notably as the \u2018post-authorization phase of a strategic decision\u2019 (Anchor & Aldehayyat, 2016, p. 649). Another proposed definition has considered the whole organization as follows: \u2018the communication, interpretation, adoption, and enactment of strategic plans\u2019 (Noble, 1999). Most conventional approaches have adopted a temporal sequencing approach towards the three elements of strategic planning, formulation and implementation. Following this approach strategy is first formulated and then implemented. However, a practical reality is overlooked, namely the inseparability of different stages in the planning process and that organizations sometimes need to improvise emergent strategies in the face of uncertainty (McDermott & O\u2019Connor, 2002). The need for organizations to improvise is particularly evident at the time of writing which coincides with the Covid-19 outbreak. Inevitably, hospitality and tourism organizations could not have been entirely prepared for such an eventuality.",

Various scholars have examined the relationship between organizational structure and strategy implementation. For example, O\u2019Reilly et al. (2010) examine how the implementation of strategic initiatives was influenced by the consistency of leadership effectiveness across different levels of the hierarchy. They concluded that \u2018it is not the effectiveness of a leader in isolation that affects organizational performance, but the alignment of leaders across hierarchical levels that is associated with the successful implementation of a strategic change\u2019 (p.111). On the other hand, Zott and Amit (2008) claim that performance is influenced by the fit between strategy and the prevailing business model. Another key managerial consideration is how to measure and evaluate performance during and after strategy implementation. The control function evidently occupies a critical position. Henri (2006) examined the relationship between management control systems and implementation success and suggests that an interactive use of performance measurement systems is significant in translating strategy into organizational performance.",

The extent of strategic consensus is one of the most important interpersonal factors for implementation. Strategic consensus is defined as a shared organizational understanding and commitment to a strategy (Noble, 1999). Whereas strategic consensus has been treated as a critical success factor, Walter et al. (2013) also show that strategic alignment to the environment is an important complement to consensus. Studies that examine commitment at different managerial levels show that the strategy implementation process is vulnerable to potential conflicts between mid-level and top-level management (Huy, 2011). Similarly, and in the absence of sufficient leadership efforts, employee resistance may hinder strategic change (Furst & Cable, 2008). Bundy et al. (2013) adopt a broader view of strategic consensus and place their focus on external stakeholders. They propose that the responsiveness of firms to stakeholder concerns depends on strategic cognition, defined as the degree to which management prioritize a stakeholder issue. The literature on strategic consensus commonly articulates the merits of a collective organizational mind-set for purposes of implementation and performance. Despite the conventional assumption that strategic consensus and implementation success are positively related, Kellermanns et al. (2011) note that the results of empirical studies about the characteristics of this relationship have been inconsistent. They find that the relationship between strategic consensus and performance is moderated by the place of participants in the hierarchy, type of strategy content, and environmental dynamism.",

The current researchers sought to identify the related theories as they read through each of the relevant articles. It was observed that most of the articles drew from multiple theories. However, when pressed to determine the primary theoretical framework that is adopted by an article, it was found that stakeholder theory is the most commonly used (n = 53). The stakeholder theory perspective views a company as a set of relationships amongst groups that have a stake in that business (Jones, 1995). Stakeholder theory asserts the critical importance of managing these relationships for the creation and distribution of value (Freeman, 1984). It views stakeholders as playing a significant role as influencers of strategic decisions (Rodgers & Gago, 2004; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008). From these observations, it is evident that stakeholder theory provides a useful lens for examining strategy implementation issues from a relational perspective. Most of the articles in our sample that used stakeholder theory are focused on the implementation of tourism and/or destination management strategies. One explanation for the popularity of stakeholder relationships as a topic in strategy implementation research is the necessity of assembling the collective efforts of various bodies to implement such plans. Comparatively speaking, stakeholder theory has not been a popular framework in mainstream strategic management studies and scholarly interest has only increased recently (Laplume et al., 2008; Bridoux & Stoelhorst, 2014). Its relative prominence in hospitality and tourism studies may be attributable to field specific characteristics. The particular need for stakeholder cooperation and coordination in tourism strategy implementation may have enhanced the usefulness of stakeholder theory as a lens to illuminate different parts of the process.",

The prominence of explorative studies signals a need for theory development and indicates that new investigations should be undertaken to validate new constructs and propositions.

In these studies the methods deployed were: single case study (n = 23), multiple case study (n = 8) and action research (n = 1).

When the overall state of the strategy implementation literature in hospitality and tourism is evaluated, we see that most articles fit into the nascent or intermediate research categories. In other words, we can safely claim that strategy implementation research in hospitality and tourism remains immature. At best, it may be concluded that hospitality and tourism articles provided provisional theoretical contributions.

Another interesting finding in this cluster was that sustainability is the third most common area in which implementation issues are discussed. This is consistent with the increasing popularity of sustainability research in management and organization studies. Information technology, innovation and revenue management strategies are the least studied subjects in terms of implementation success. Considering the increasing importance of data management and innovation in business performance and competitiveness, information technologies and innovation deserve more attention from hospitality and tourism researchers.

Given the increasingly international nature of the hospitality and tourism sector, we believe that multi-country studies deserve greater attention. Considering that strategy implementation is influenced by both context and by organizational factors, cross-country comparative studies can illuminate the issues that are faced by multinational hospitality businesses. For example, comparative case studies may offer an enhanced understanding of how successful implementation processes can be transferred to properties in other countries across international hotel chains.",

        {
            "text": "The second gap concerns theoretical perspectives. The current literature has deployed a narrow range of theoretical frameworks to address a limited range of important topics. Future studies may use new theoretical frameworks such as resource dependence theory or new institutional theory to shed light on implementation related topics. For example, resource dependence theory may prove useful when examining how hospitality businesses implement strategies to manage their resource dependencies with the external environment. Meanwhile, institutional theory may add new insights about how strategy implementation practices are influenced by different institutional arrangements in various contexts. On the other hand, future studies can also apply previously used theories to new topics. For example, agency theory may be deployed to examine the principal-agent relationships between company headquarters and foreign branches in hotel chains.",

            "text": "The third gap relates to methodology. Most of the studies which provide explicit expression of their preferred methods use single case studies. More variation is needed in terms of research methods if relevant issues are to be addressed accurately. Where case studies are used they should extend multiple cases in order to enable comparison within samples. Secondly, our overall findings about the research life cycle have shown that strategy implementation research in hospitality and tourism remains immature. More testing of theory is needed to move this research area towards maturity. It was also striking that explorative studies have been used intensively, though no suggestive theory has been produced for the area. Those conducting future explorative studies should aim to make a stronger theoretical contribution. We also observed that hybrid data were only used in a small number of studies. The deployment of mixed research methods might enable researchers to provide more significant theoretical contributions. To date, even theory testing studies did not express their theoretical approach explicitly or state the theories that were being tested. Future studies should give greater prominence to the refinement of methodologies and clearer articulation of research aims.",

Strategy implementation studies should address emerging trends that are likely to affect the future of strategy implementation. Advances in information technologies, artificial intelligence and big data are among the top trends that will cause long-lasting changes to the implementation of strategy in hospitality and tourism. Such topics evidently offer fruitful research avenues for the future. Another under-researched subject is the organizational governance of strategy implementation. Governance related articles in the literature generally focused on relationships with external stakeholders. However, governance mechanisms for strategy implementation inside the organization did not receive the attention that they deserved. Future researchers should address overlooked issues such as control mechanisms, implementation tools, corporate politics and power relations among related actors. A largely neglected area of content was the assessment of implementation performance. Measuring implementation performance serves an important function in strategy evaluation and therefore deserves more interest from future researchers. A final research domain for potential contributions is the development of new strategy implementation frameworks for hospitality organizations. The topic clusters and the research life cycle framework offer novel insights about optimal research directions. The four types of gap in the literature and possible future research questions are presented in Table 4\n.",
