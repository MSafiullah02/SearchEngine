Although this material often is referred to as \"mucosal thickening,\" the presence of air bubbles in the material (figure 1) makes it unlikely that it is mucosal thickening. The current study was undertaken to investigate the composition of the adherent material. Of particular interest was whether the adherent material was a plasma (fibrin) clot that resulted from plasma exudation during the viral infection. Because samples of material from the sinus cavities of patients with colds were not available, the focus of the study was shifted to an evaluation of whether cross-linked fibrin that could clot appeared in the nasal fluid (a surrogate for sinus fluid) of subjects with rhinovirus colds.",

In the present study, we investigated the presence of cross-linked fibrin, the functional product of fibrinogen, in the nasal fluid of subjects with colds.

In spite of the considerable difference between the molecular size of fibrinogen (340 kDa) and that of albumin (70 kDa), fibrinogen appears to transit nasal epithelium as readily as does albumin during colds, because there was a strong correlation between the concentration of fibrinogen and that of albumin. We also demonstrated that fibrinogen from plasma exudate can be converted to insoluble cross-linked fibrin in the nasal fluid. The concentration of fibrin, expressed in fibrinogen equivalents, was approximately half that of fibrinogen, and the fibrin concentration showed the same temporal pattern as did the fibrinogen concentration during illness.",

            "text": "It is reasonable to assume that cross-linked fibrin also is present in the sinuses during colds and that it may be responsible for the adherent material observed on the sinus wall. If these assumptions are true, the presence of a fibrin clot has implications for treatment strategies to enhance drainage of the sinuses during colds. Medications in current use, including mucoevacuants and decongestants, would not be expected to affect cross-linked fibrin. Other measures may be necessary to reduce and/or solubilize fibrin in secretions; such measures involve reducing the influx of plasma proteins into the upper airway or lysing fibrin on sinus mucosa. Prophylactic oral steroid administration has been shown to reduce albumin and kinin concentrations in the nasal fluid of volunteers with experimentally induced rhinovirus colds, a finding that suggests that a reduction in plasma exudation occurred [7] . The use of topical agents with fibrinolytic activity might be another approach, but methods for delivering fibrinolytic drugs to the sinus cavity would need to be devised for this approach to be successful. In any event, the presence of insoluble fibrin in nasal fluid and, probably, in sinus fluid during colds has not received the attention it may warrant.",
