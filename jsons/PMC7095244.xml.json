The outbreak began in June, which in this country is a winter month when pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) generally find their resources strained by a seasonal increase in acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). In view of the impact of this illness in Mexico, it was thought that the number of patients here would be even greater than usual, and measures were taken to prepare PICUs for the possibility of an epidemic. The effectiveness of these measures, however, was potentially limited by a lack of information on the incidence of severe respiratory disease requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) concurrent with the circulation of the H1N1 virus. Though this information already existed for adult patients, to this day it has still not been described in pediatric ICU populations.",

Prematurity, presence of complex chronic conditions (CCCs) [5], the acquisition of H1N1 (community or nosocomial), and the presence of co-infections (defined as positive microbial culture obtained in blood or pleural effusion or bronchial aspiration samples during the first 24 h after admission to a PICU, and/or positive indirect immunofluorescens to other viral agents) were also registered. Dates of hospital and PICU admissions, dates of initiation of MV (invasive or non invasive), and liberation from MV were recorded in due time. For each of the first 28 days after a patient\u2019s admission to the PICU, physiological markers of organ dysfunction, ventilatory parameters, X-rays, blood gases, and treatment-related variables were also registered. All of these variables included: mode of ventilation, FiO2, positive end expiratory pressure, peak airway pressure, plateau airway pressure, mean airway pressure, and adjuncts to MV such as prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Daily arterial blood gas values included pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and oxygen saturation. When multiple daily measurements were performed, those closest to 0800 hours were recorded. The presence of barotrauma, previously defined, was documented [6]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS [7], and ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined using the criteria of the CDC [8]. Sepsis and organ dysfunctions were defined according to the International Consensus Conference on Sepsis in Pediatric Patients [9]. Specific treatments were recorded, including the administration of oseltamivir, inotropic or vasopressor drugs, and antibiotics. The primary outcome was mortality at 28 days after admission to the PICU.",

The comparison of continuous variables was made with the Student\u2019s t test for variables with normal distribution or the Mann-Whitney U test for variables with non-normal distribution. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare continuous variables among more than two groups. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with mortality, and stepwise selection and backward elimination techniques were used to construct the multivariate model. We included the following variables that were significant in the univariate analysis: hospital acquisition of H1N1, presence of at least one chronic condition, presence of cardiovascular, renal, or hematological dysfunctions, use of oseltamivir within the 24 h of hospital admission, and a PaO2 to FiO2 ratio at the 3rd day of less than 100 (we chose this cutoff point because a previous study showed that a PaO2 to FiO2 ratio value of <100 was that which could best be used to discriminate between surviving and non-surviving mechanically ventilated pediatric patients [6]). Goodness of fit was determined using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. A two-sided p value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant, except in the multivariate model, where a p-value of less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant.",

The rate of utilization of MV reported in adult patients with this infection varies from 65 to 96% [12\u201314]. In Australia and New Zealand, the ANZIC Influenza Investigators recently found that 456 of 706 (65%) adult patients underwent MV [12], and in Mexico, Dominguez-Cherit et al. [14] have reported an even higher rate of 96% (56 out of 58) in adults, a rate that is similar to that of the children in our study.

Of 147 patients with severe acute respiratory failure during their PICU stay, 118 (80%) met the criteria for ARDS. Hence, the non-survivors had more serious lung injury, characterized by a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and a higher oxygenation index. The mortality rate of pediatric patients with H1N1 infection is clearly higher than the rate for those with ALI of other causes [15, 16]. Our findings are comparable to previously reported rates of 42 and 50%, respectively, of ventilated children with H1N1 infection [17, 18], though a recent Canadian study has reported a lower mortality rate of almost 8% [13]. These differences in mortality rates could be well explained, at least in part, by the fact that the studies were carried out in different seasons of the year and had different inclusion criteria that might have been reflected in the incidences of ARDS and the use of MV.",
