Recently, this was confirmed in a large prospective trial of COPD, but importantly, the other factor that was found to be independently associated with exacerbation risk was the occurrence of exacerbations themselves. 5 In the context of acute infection, our results emphasize that there is an important interaction between acute infection and severity of airflow obstruction. In addition, we have decided to divide subjects into those with wholly reversible airways disease (asthma) and those with incomplete reversibility, COPD. We acknowledge that such a description may be a departure from traditional diagnostic paradigms for airway disease that focus on a mixture of history, exposure and airway physiology. We have remained essentially true to this in terms of asthma, with subjects when stable needing to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction; but within this group, we chose not to exclude smokers. Nonetheless, the group we have defined as asthma were younger, were less likely to have smoked and had smoked less compared with those classified COPD. In contrast, those with COPD did not necessarily have a history of smoking, emphasizing that smoking-induced fixed obstructive airway disease does not have to be solely synonymous with COPD. In this way, we feel we have been able to examine the effects of fixed airway disease, for which COPD stands, and found that independent of smoking status, fixed airway disease is an important predictor in multivariate analysis for both LOS and readmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 157, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 168, "end": 170, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 496, "end": 497, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "If specific antiviral strategies are to be considered in treating acute exacerbations, the pattern of these infections needs to be clearly defined.

The recent discovery of a new species of RV-C 21 has led to renewed interest as to whether specific RV species may be associated with more severe clinical disease. In young children with acute asthma, there does appear to be such an association with one large US study demonstrating RV-C followed by RV-A was associated with severe exacerbations. 22 This was particularly marked in a Western Australia study, where the majority of children with acute asthma had RV-C and it again was associated with more severe disease. 17 Our findings in adults do not support the assertion that the majority of exacerbations are due to RV-C, with RV-A clearly playing a prominent role. The differences with our findings could be explained in several ways. RV-C may particularly affect children, with a possible tropism for asthma and atopic disease. 17 Any variation in RV-induced exacerbations may also reflect the strains circulating in the community, as we did not include non-asthmatic/COPD adults or children, this remains unclear. Alternatively, RV-C may be more difficult to identify in adults, who usually present later with exacerbations compared with children, and shed less virus for shorter periods of time.

It has been shown previously in a smaller prospective study in subjects with COPD that co-infection led to longer LOS and worse lung function. 25 In vitro RV is capable of promoting bacterial infection through disruption of the epithelium 26 and chronic bacterial infection with H. influenzae potentiates the inflammatory response to RV. 27 RV has also been shown to increase the H. influenzae burden during acute COPD. 28 Those with chronic bacterial infection therefore appear to be particularly susceptible to the effects of virus infection, while our results suggest this is relevant in both asthma and COPD. How this occurs and how co-infection worsens underlying chronic airway disease warrant further investigation. As yet, no specific interventions have looked at minimizing the effect of RV virus infection in adults with asthma and COPD, although these exist. 29 Macrolide antibiotics are also an interesting potential therapeutic, they reduce exacerbation risk in COPD 30 and may reduce the impact of RV infection at least in vitro. 31 However, it is also worthy to consider that uncomplicated and inexpensive infection control procedures such as hand-washing and wearing surgical masks are potentially very effective at limiting virus transmission and can be employed by patients and their families at home. 32 In conclusion, our results confirm the important independent role of virus infection along with viral/ bacterial co-infection as independent predictors of acute severity in COPD and asthma and for the first time demonstrate that those with co-infection are also more likely to be readmitted to hospital following their exacerbation.
