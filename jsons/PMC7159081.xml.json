Mortality reductions in some countries have been the result of trajectories of rapid decline that started long before the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were developed in 1990. Others have succeeded in improving progress since the 1990s, but some countries continue to struggle.\u2022Causes of death suggest a mortality transition in maternal deaths in the region. Child deaths are mainly attributable to the persistence of neonatal causes along with key preventable factors in the postneonatal period.\u2022Disparities in intervention coverage are most acute in countries with the lowest intervention coverage overall.\u2022Despite the variations in achievements, some countries are notable success stories. Suggested key factors include the ability to link maternal, neonatal, and child health interventions to broader health-system investments and to target access to rural and disadvantaged populations.\u2022Increasing coverage to 60% will have a substantial effect on maternal deaths caused by unsafe abortion, hypertensive diseases, and postpartum haemorrhage and on neonatal deaths caused by pneumonia, sepsis, and birth asphyxia. Although there might not be quick solutions for maternal, neonatal, and child health in the region, coordinated expansion of proven effective interventions can contribute to improved reductions in mortality.\u2022There is a need for stronger regional cooperation through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to provide support to countries that need to accelerate progress to meet the MDGs.\n\n",

We focus on a region, collectively the ninth largest economy in the world, whose performance and achievements are often hidden by larger countries such as India or China, as well as by the UN agency groupings of the region that do not take into account historical and geopolitical ties within southeast Asia.10 In this paper, we critically review the region's achievements in reducing maternal and child mortality and highlight key factors that explain the successes and challenges in reaching these goals during competing worldwide, regional, and national health problems. We first report on patterns of mortality reduction within southeast Asia and major causes of maternal and child deaths in the context of MDG4 and MDG5. We investigate two country cases to highlight the notable variations in mortality reduction. Finally, we use an analysis of the deaths that could be averted through expanded coverage to identify more effective approaches for improving maternal, neonatal, and child health in southeast Asia.",

We also reviewed estimates from international data sources from UNICEF, WHO, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (webappendix pp 1\u20132). We present country-specific estimates on maternal, neonatal, and under-5 mortality rates from recent UN MDG reports,2, 3 as these estimates enable cross-country comparisons on trends in mortality using replicable estimation methods that reduce sources of non-sampling error. These estimates tend to be more conservative in the rate of decline than estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. On the basis of increasing awareness of the burden of neonatal mortality, we sought comparable estimates of trends that separated neonatal (death within the first 28 days after birth) and postneonatal (death between 28 days and 1 year after birth) mortality. As UN models do not have neonatal time trends for all countries in the region, we report estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.11 We report estimates on causes of neonatal and child deaths on the basis of standardised methods for estimating the distribution of causes of child deaths.12 We compiled estimates of causes of maternal deaths from Countdown 2015 country reports4 and WHO.13 We evaluated data from the Demographic and Health Surveys14 and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys15, 16 to assess existing intervention coverage within the region, with these data sources providing the ability to disaggregate coverage estimates by wealth quintile and rural or urban status17, 18, 19, 20 to establish the country average of coverage and to assess the programme coverage in disadvantaged populations by economic status and geography. We calculated regional estimates using country-level data from the specific source cited, unless otherwise indicated.",

For this analysis, we assessed all the maternal, neonatal, and child health interventions included in LiST.31 The interventions and the estimates of their effectiveness are provided in webappendix pp 3\u20138. Values for the effectiveness of interventions were developed through a standardised review process using established criteria to identify which interventions to include on the basis of levels of evidence.31 The analysis was done for all ten countries and then for three subgroups of countries on the basis of observed patterns of mortality reduction: subgroup 1 (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand); subgroup 2 (the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam); and subgroup 3 (Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar). We assessed potential lives saved at three hypothetical coverage levels: 60%, 90%, and 99%.",

Differences in skilled birth attendance between urban and rural Laotian populations are the largest among the six countries included in this comparison. Skilled birth attendance could be viewed as one indicator of broader health-system development, and the generally low coverage coupled with a high extent of inequality highlights the need for more comprehensive and coordinated health system improvements in the region overall.5 These patterns also point to the necessity of targeting the most vulnerable populations and maintaining attention to equity while increasing programme coverage.35\n",

For example, the LiST analysis indicates that providing basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care has the potential to avert half of all maternal deaths and about one in six neonatal deaths in Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. However, prevention of these deaths might be possible only if care coverage is rapidly expanded in low-income and rural populations, possibly through sustained donor investments, given the low levels of domestic health spending.

The experience of the ASEAN, as discussed in this paper, suggests that effective interventions to curb maternal and child mortality need to be deployed to actively target the disadvantaged populations who are most affected by unsafe abortion, hypertensive diseases, postpartum haemorrhage, pneumonia, sepsis, and birth asphyxia. Far from expecting coverage of these programmes to passively diffuse to the very poor, governments must innovatively combine health interventions with non-health programmes such as micro-finance schemes and conditional cash transfer mechanisms that have proven successful in other settings.56, 57\n",

As the donor community focuses its attention on the burdens of Africa and south Asia, ASEAN countries must provide support to each other. Examples of such support mechanisms already in place include financial cooperation through the ASEAN surveillance process, which is an early warning system to keep track of macroeconomic trends and to provide early detection of any adverse development. For public health, the ASEAN SARS Containment Information Network exemplifies how member countries share essential information, best practices, and new findings for severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, ASEAN has yet to develop initiatives for maternal, neonatal, and child health, which could be developed through sharing information and best practices (possibly starting by resolving the absence of comparable data across countries); financial cooperation efforts could be linked to outcomes, and the attainment of MDGs for member countries behind target could be made an ASEAN priority.",
