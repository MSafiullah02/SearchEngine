            "text": "Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), the aetiological agent of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae [1]. PPR is an acute, highly contagious, world organization for animal health (OIE) notifiable and economically important transboundary viral disease of sheep and goats that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Clinically, the disease is characterized by a high fever, conjunctivitis, oculo-nasal discharge, necrotizing and erosive stomatitis, and diarrhoea [2]; notably, PPRV infection often causes foetal mummification, abortions late in pregnancy, and the birth of dead lambs or weak lambs that die within a couple of days [3,4]. The PPRV genome of approximately 16 kilobases (kb) encodes six structural proteins, namely, the nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), haemagglutinin (H) and large (L) proteins in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction (3\u2032-N-P-M-F-H-L-5\u2032); two non-structural proteins (C/V) are also encoded due to the RNA editing of the phosphoprotein gene. Four different lineages of PPRV (I, II, III, and IV) have been defined worldwide based on the molecular epidemiology of the \u201cN\u201d and \u201cF\u201d gene sequences of the virus [5,6]. PPRV is currently endemic in most of Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and China and causes significant economic losses [2,7].",

            "text": "Cell death in multicellular organisms is classified as autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis, each of which are morphologically distinct [8]. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process that involves the formation of a double-membrane structure called the autophagosome. It delivers misfolded or long-lived cytoplasmic proteins and damaged organelles to lysosomes for degradation and recycling [9,10]. Currently, LC3 is widely used as a marker for monitoring autophagy [11,12]. In addition to LC3, the polyubiquitin-binding protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also called p62), whose degradation is increased during autophagy, is also frequently used to assist in assessing autophagic flux [12,13]. Autophagy also contributes to innate and adaptive immunity against a wide variety of intracellular microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa [14,15]. An increasing amount of evidences suggest that the autophagy processes are also exploited by many viruses for their replication, such as the measles virus (MeV) [16], PPRV [17], hepatitis C virus [18], classical swine fever virus (CSFV) [19], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [20], avian reovirus [21], and influenza A virus [22]. However, it has been demonstrated that autophagy is involved in the elimination of the herpes simplex virus [23], foot-and-mouth disease virus [24], human rotavirus [25] and cytomegalovirus [26]. Thus, there is an extremely complex interaction between autophagy and invading viruses. In contrast, apoptosis is regulated by CASPs/caspases, which are apoptosis-related cysteine peptidases [27,28]. Two main signals induce apoptosis, namely, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The induction of the intrinsic pathway results in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, thus triggering CASP3/caspase-3 by activating CASP9/caspase-9 [27]. The extrinsic pathway activates CASP3 via CASP8/caspase-8 cleavage in a death receptor-mediated manner [27]. Apoptosis could also be considered a defence mechanism against virus replication because it triggers cell death [29]. Moreover, there are a variety of mechanisms by which the apoptotic and autophagic pathways are intertwined to affect cell fate [30]. It has been demonstrated that viruses can exploit autophagy and apoptosis for their replication [20,31,32]. A previous study suggested that autophagy can promote PRRSV replication by postponing apoptosis through the formation of a Bad-Beclin-1 complex [33]. Autophagy is involved in the apoptosis and death of T lymphocytes in the spleen of pigs infected with CSFV [34]. Moreover, autophagy triggered by genotype VII Newcastle disease virus infection was essential for viral replication, NDV-induced apoptosis, and cell survival in chicken cells and tissues [35].",

However, the functional interaction between autophagy and apoptosis during PPRV infection in caprine-derived cells is largely unknown. In this study, we first investigate the roles of apoptosis and autophagy in PPRV-infected caprine EECs and then reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which autophagy limits apoptosis and contributes to virus infection.",

Throughout our study, caprine endometrial epithelial cells were used for the experiments, and we showed that PPRV can successfully replicate in caprine EECs, further confirming the clinical phenomenon of abortions in PPRV-infected goats [3,4]; these data thus provide a theoretical basis for the replication mechanism of PPRV. Currently, increasing evidence suggests that several genetic connections participate in crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis [47]. Although previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy and apoptosis are both induced by PPRV infection [17,36], it is not yet known whether crosstalk might exist between autophagic and apoptotic pathways in host cells subjected to PPRV infection.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the infection processes of morbilliviruses are closely related with autophagic flux [16,17]. However, the coxsackievirus B3, herpes simplex virus and influenza A virus have been shown to induce autophagosome formation but block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes [48\u201350]. More importantly, MeV infection induces successive autophagic signalling, leading to a sustained increase in autophagic flux [16]. Our data are consistent with those of MeV; indeed, E64d treatment increased the amount of LC3-II in both rapamycin-treated and virus-infected EECs, indicating that there was increased autophagic flux. Immunoblotting analyses for changes in the protein levels of p62 further verified that autophagic flux increased upon PPRV infection. Furthermore, LAMP1 is also required for the fusion of autophagosomes and endosomal vesicles [51]. Our data showed that endogenous LC3 partially overlapped with LAMP1 in PPRV-infected EECs. It is suggested that PPRV infection induced the fusion of autophagosomes with acidified LAMP1-positive lysosomes and thereby strengthened the degradation of autophagy substrates.

Our results show that UV-inactivated PPRV lost its ability to induce autophagy, indicating that viral replication was required for PPRV infection-induced autophagy. In contrast, low basal levels of LC3-II were present in mock-infected cells, indicating that basal autophagy in normal EECs was essential for maintaining homeostasis. Recent studies show that several members of the Paramyxoviridae family, including MeV [16], human respiratory syncytial virus [52], canine distemper virus [53] and Newcastle disease virus [35], can utilize an autophagy mechanism to facilitate replication. To further determine what role autophagy plays in the replication of PPRV, we examined viral replication ability by exposing EECs to rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy that specifically inhibits the action of mTOR [54]. Our data showed that rapamycin treatment not only upregulated the expression of the viral N protein but also increased the yield of PPRV progeny. Moreover, the inhibition of autophagy in the replication of PPRV still needs to be examined in depth. NH4Cl and chloroquine inhibit autophagy by reducing the acidity of lysosomes and inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes [55]. We found that NH4Cl and chloroquine treatment significantly increased the accumulation of LC3-II and p62 following PPRV infection. The increase in the levels of both LC3-II and p62 in PPRV-infected cells after NH4Cl and chloroquine treatment was only a portion of what had been turned over by lysosomal proteolysis. Wortmannin inhibits autophagy by blocking the formation of autophagosomes [56], which could not increase the accumulation of LC3-II and p62 following PPRV infection. Importantly, both the chemical inhibitor and shRNA depletion of the essential autophagy proteins ATG7 and Beclin-1 downregulated N expression and decreased the yield of PPRV progeny. Based on these results, we conclude that the different stages of the autophagy pathway serve a valuable role in PPRV infection, rather than blocking the virus spread in host cells. It is important to note that the effect of the mutative levels of autophagy on extracellular viral titres and RNA levels were the same as those on intracellular viral titres and RNA levels, indicating that autophagy is a regulator of the release of cytoplasmic viruses.",

One recent observation is that the expression of MeV-C is required for the induction of late autophagy in infected HeLa cells, subsequent to MeV replication [16]. In the present study, we found that PPRV-C significantly increased the level of LC3-II and promoted the degradation of p62. These results indicated that PPRV-C can induce autophagosome formation and activate a complete autophagic response. MeV can exploit autophagy through the physical interaction of the MeV-C protein with the autophagy-associated protein IRGM (immunity-related GTPase M) [60]. Moreover, the C protein has a high degree of homology with the morbilliviruses [61]. The molecular mechanism for how PPRV-C affects the autophagy process related to IRGM needs to be examined in greater detail. Unlike the C protein, the V protein is phosphorylated and can bind both the N and L proteins; therefore, it is believed to regulate RNA synthesis [62]. Our data clearly demonstrate that the PPRV-V protein did not modulate autophagosome formation but significantly decreased the degradation of p62. It is likely that the V protein is important and necessary for the induction of autophagic flux by PPRV. Interestingly, we also found that PPRV-N increased the level of LC3-II and promoted the degradation of p62. The contribution of the different autophagy signals in PPRV maturation remains to be investigated. Moreover, autophagy induction has been reported after co-expression of the F and H proteins in different members of the Paramyxoviridae family, strongly indicating that there is a common link between membrane fusion and autophagy [63]. Our data showed that PPRV-H in the cytoplasm of EECs significantly increased the level of LC3-II. Moreover, PPRV-H in the cytoplasm of EECs cannot promote the degradation of p62, indicating that the intracellular H protein activates an incomplete autophagic response in host epithelial cells. In addition, MeV induces autophagy through the CD46-Cyt-1/GOPC pathway, which indicates that a cell surface pathogen receptor can directly trigger autophagy, a critical step for controlling infection [41,64]. Recent reports also demonstrate that SLAM recruits the vps34/Beclin-1 autophagic complex, suggesting that morbilliviruses might induce autophagy pathways upon receptor binding with the H protein [65]. Importantly, nectin-4 was identified as the epithelial receptor for several strains of MeV and PPRV [45,66]. To reinforce the theory that receptors could induce autophagy upon pathogen binding, autophagy induction mediated by nectin-4 and PPRV-H in host epithelial cells still needs to be examined in detail. In addition, our confocal immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that the PPRV structural proteins N and H colocalized with LC3 in host cells. However, colocalization between GFP-LC3 and the MeV-N protein was not observed [16]. These results suggest that significant differences between the replication mechanisms and characteristics exist between different viruses of the same family, which may be related to host specificity, cell types and different pathogenic mechanisms of the infections. Interestingly, the non-structural protein C also colocalized with LC3 in host cells. These results indicated that the PPRV-C protein may utilize the membranes of autophagosome-like vesicles to enhance its effects in regulating intracellular responses. Undoubtedly, both of the experiments indicate that the replication complexes of PPRV were formed on the membranes of autophagosome-like vesicles. However, we did not investigate whether analogues of the LC3-I-positive vesicular structures (termed EDEMosomes), which are hijacked by viruses for their replication [67], exist within the autophagosome-like vesicles induced by PPRV infection. Further investigation is needed to conclusively answer this question.",

The MeV-V protein interacts with the DNA binding domains of p53 family proteins to inhibit virus-induced cell apoptosis [69]. Indeed, the inhibition of apoptosis strongly facilitates MeV replication [63]. Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy causes a growth defect and induces more apoptosis in infected cells, suggesting that the main function of autophagy in the course of MeV infection is to delay MeV-induced apoptosis [16]. In this study, we found that the inhibition of autophagy at different stages reduces viral particle release, which was achieved through the effects on the apoptosis. Interestingly, the inhibition of autophagosome formation with wortmannin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in EECs in PPRV infection. However, in the fusion stage of autophagosomes and lysosomes, the inhibition of autophagy with NH4Cl and chloroquine did not increase the number of apoptotic cells. These data indicated that autophagosome formation plays a critical anti-apoptosis role during PPRV infection. Moreover, the expression products of the ATG7 and Beclin-1 genes are essential for the activation of autophagosome formation, and knocking down the ATG7 and Beclin-1 genes can impair the autophagic pathway [70,71]. Interestingly, Beclin-1 is required for ATG7-dependent and ATG7-independent autophagy [72]. Beclin-1 also regulates apoptosis by interacting with both BCL2 and BCL2L1/BCL-XL [73]. Additionally, apoptosis may inhibit autophagy as CAPN/calpain cleaves ATG5, which triggers CASP-dependent cell death [71,74]. Caspases can also cleave Beclin-1 in apoptosis, thereby destroying its pro-autophagic activity [75]. In this study, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 mediated pathway activation was triggered by PPRV in both ATG7 and Beclin-1 knockdown cells. These results suggested that Beclin-1 and ATG7 may facilitate virus replication via regulating autophagy and apoptosis in PPRV-infected EECs.",
