Nonetheless, it is estimated that 22.6 million (55%) of 41 million antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections, including both lower and upper respiratory infections, were for causes unlikely to have a bacterial etiology [3]. Although in many cases of otitis and sinusitis and probably 20%\u201340% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia a bacterial superinfection may occur, respiratory infections due to a virus(es) alone are common in the adult and pediatric outpatient populations. In addition, the vast majority of respiratory tract infections in nonimmunocompromised hospitalized children (especially those <5 years of age) are due to 1 or more viruses, without a secondary bacterial infection.",

RADTs have highly variable sensitivities (10%\u201375%) and specificities (50%\u2013100%) depending on the viral target, age of the patient, sample collection, and duration of symptoms prior to testing [4\u20136].

Both methods can readily detect 7 of the common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 [PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3], and RSV). In addition, DFA testing can detect human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [6]. The specificity of DFA testing and rapid cell culture are high, but the sensitivities of the tests can vary from a low of 50% (RSV culture) to a high of >80% (influenza A), when compared with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) [5, 6, 10]. DFA testing can be performed in as little as 30\u201360 min, and shell vial and R-Mix rapid cell cultures (Quidel/Diagnostic Hybrids) generally identify respiratory viruses in 24\u201348 h [6]. If these tests are performed on site, the time to virus detection can be within a time frame that could affect patient management. However, these tests are not widely available outside larger hospitals and reference laboratories. Although these 8 viruses are responsible for a large number of respiratory tract infections, bocavirus, selected coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU-1), parainfluenza 4, and rhinovirus are also important causes of respiratory disease and are generally only detected using NAATs.",

            "text": "Because antiviral therapies are currently limited to the treatment of influenza A, influenza B, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and varicella zoster virus pneumonia, it is often argued that the specific identification of other viruses is not relevant, because the information would not change patient management. From a treatment standpoint, this may currently be true; however, the respiratory viruses cause similar illnesses, and diagnosis based on clinical symptoms alone can be highly inaccurate [11]. For example, a study by Poehling et al revealed that physicians who used only clinical symptoms recognized influenza in only 28% of hospitalized children and 17% of nonhospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed influenza [11]. Therefore, establishing the viral etiological characteristics of the illness is often highly dependent on accurate diagnostic testing. In addition, new therapeutic agents for respiratory viruses are in development, and clinical trials for these agents will need rapid diagnostics that detect a broad range of viral pathogens. Once these new drugs are approved, clinical laboratories will need the tools to identify each virus so that appropriate antiviral therapy can be rapidly initiated. In addition, during the first weeks of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak in the spring of 2009, multiple influenza viruses were cocirculating [5]. It was necessary to subtype influenza A strains to differentiate seasonal influenza A/H1, seasonal influenza A/H3, and 2009 influenza A H1N1. Subtyping is necessary to provide relevant information needed for appropriate selection of antiviral therapy, in particular for acutely ill patients. Antiviral resistance testing of influenza isolates from 2009 (www.cdc.gov/flu) revealed that the circulating seasonal influenza A/H1 strains were resistant to oseltamivir (99.6%), and seasonal influenza A/H3 and 2009 influenza A H1N1 were resistant to the adamantanes (100%). In addition, several patients with 2009 influenza A H1N1 infections developed oseltamivir resistance [12, 13].",

            "text": "Especially in the treatment of inpatients, the costs of rapid viral diagnostics can be offset by the improvement in patient care and financial outcomes [16\u201319]. Hendrickson et al showed that rapid respiratory virus diagnosis can lead to benefits in several areas, including up to a 50% reduction in hospital days, 30% reduction in antibiotic use, and 20% reduction in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures [16]. The burden of nosocomial influenza can be high, incurring additional costs for diagnostic tests, increased morbidity, and extended hospitalization [17, 18]. Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests are needed to identify patients with influenza at admission, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission by facilitating isolation and cohorting decisions [18]. Studies have documented substantial nosocomial transmission of hMPV in pediatric units [20], as well as in chronic care facilities [21], similar to what is seen with RSV. During the height of RSV season, many institutions must cohort RSV-positive children because of a lack of private rooms. However, dual infections with RSV and hMPV do occur. Limiting diagnostics to RSV alone in a cohorting scenario could put other seriously ill children at risk for acquisition of a second viral infection with hMPV. The meaning of mixed viral infections can be defined only if testing is comprehensive. Broad test panels also allow for monitoring the epidemiologic patterns of respiratory disease and for identifying new or reemerging pathogens. Finally, the identification of the exact respiratory virus is essential for the accurate assessment of the efficacy of vaccines.",

Factors that determine test cost include test volume, the price of the test kits, the number of tests per kit, size of the testing run, the number of controls required per testing run, and the type and amount of ancillary supplies. Often FDA-approved/cleared kits do not contain nucleic acid extraction reagents, so additional equipment and reagents are necessary and can add $3\u2013$15 per test. Batch testing of samples may reduce the cost per test; however, often batching is not practical if the time to result is delayed beyond a period that would affect either clinical management or infection control practices. Instrumentation costs for molecular tests can be substantial, with real-time instrumentation costing on average $35,000\u2013$85,000 per instrument, and higher volume laboratories may require multiple instruments. Laboratories must also calculate the cost for technical time, which is again highly variable depending on the test complexity and run size. Finally, the costs for quality control, proficiency testing, and competency assessment all affect the overall cost per test.

The ability of NAATs to rapidly and accurately detect a novel pathogen was best exemplified during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic [5, 22\u201324]. NAATs are especially suited for the identification of respiratory pathogens that are not routinely or easily cultured (eg, hMPV, bocavirus, parainfluenza 4, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae), pathogens that are dangerous to culture (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), pathogens for which the time to detection by traditional means is often too delayed to affect patient care (eg, tube cell culture for influenza), and pathogens for which serologic testing is difficult to interpret (eg, C. pneumoniae). In most cases, NAATs offer enhanced sensitivity over culture methods, RADTS, and DFA testing [5, 6, 10]. The specificity of NAATs varies with target and assay design but is generally very high. In addition, laboratory-developed NAATs validated in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) requirements can be used to identify new pathogens until FDA-approved/cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices become available.

All specimens were tested by means of viral culture and/or DFA testing for the following targets: influenza A, influenza B, RSV, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, and adenovirus. The comparator methods for influenza A subtyping, RSV subtyping, and hMPV and rhinovirus detection were well-characterized RT-PCR assays followed by bidirectional sequencing. xTAG RVP sensitivity for each target was determined as follows: influenza A, 96.4%; influenza A subtyping H1, 100%; influenza A subtyping H3, 91.7%; influenza B, 91.5%; RSV A, 100%; RSV B, 100%; PIV-1, 100%; PIV-2, 100%; PIV-3, 84.2%; adenovirus, 78.3%; rhinovirus, 100%; and hMPV, 96%. The xTAG RVP specificity for each target was determined as follows: influenza A, 95.9%; influenza A subtyping H1, 100%; influenza A subtyping H3, 98.7%; influenza B, 96.7%; RSV A, 98.4%; RSV B, 97.4%; PIV-1, 99.8%; PIV-2, 99.8%; PIV-3, 99.6%; adenovirus, 100%; rhinovirus, 91.3%; and hMPV, 98.8%. Studies by Mahoney et al, using the research use\u2013only version of the xTAG RVP assay and nasopharyngeal swab specimens, compared xTAG RVP with a combination of DFA testing and viral culture [37]. For viruses that can be grown in culture, the overall sensitivities and specificities of DFA testing/culture were 91.9% and 98.2%, respectively, compared with 97.8% and 96.4%, respectively, for xTAG RVP. When viruses not routinely cultured were also included in the evaluation, the sensitivity of DFA testing/culture was 68.8%, compared with 98.4% for xTAG RVP. In addition, 5.2% of the specimens contained >1 virus. Wong et al found that the highly multiplexed xTAG RVP assay enhanced laboratory investigations of respiratory virus outbreaks and aided heath care facilities in both patient and outbreak management [39]. Studies that evaluated the performance of xTAG RVP during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak in the area of New York, New York, demonstrated that the sensitivity of xTAG RVP for the detection of 2009 influenza A H1N1 was 97.6%, compared with 88.9% for R-Mix culture, 46.7% for DFA testing, and 17.8% for RADTs [5]. xTAG RVP detected a respiratory virus in 60% of the samples, of which 36% were 2009 influenza A H1N1. Numerous mixed viral infections were also identified. Ginocchio and St. George determined that the probability of an influenza A infection due to an unsubtypeable strain (not seasonal influenza A/H1 or seasonal influenza A/H3 according to the xTAG RVP assay), identified during the outbreak, was >99% for identification as 2009 influenza A H1N1 [24]. On the basis of these 2 studies, the FDA approved changes to the package insert that state that xTAG RVP can be an effective aid in the detection of 2009 influenza A H1N1 but cannot specifically identify the 2009 influenza A H1N1 hemagglutinin gene.",

The subtyping of influenza A viruses as seasonal influenza A/H1 or seasonal influenza A/H3 or the identification of an \u201cunsubtypeable\u201d virus has proven to be an important aid in identifying novel influenza A strains. A limitation of the assay is the decreased sensitivity for the detection of certain adenovirus strains. In-house validation studies by our laboratory have found that by reducing the positive cutoff MFI level from 300 to 150 for adenovirus, improved sensitivity for the detection of adenovirus was obtained without loss of specificity (unpublished data). Additional limitations of the assay include the time to final results, number of required steps, technical hands-on time, and a potential for amplicon contamination. There is a second-generation assay called RVP FAST (Luminex) available in Europe that addresses several of these issues by reducing the number of steps and the time to results by 3\u20134 h, making it possible to provide comprehensive results within a single shift.",

The Taqman probes are labeled with a quencher dye attached to the 3'-end and a reporter dye at the 5'-end. When amplified target is present, the probes bind and the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase cleaves the probe, thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher. Because the quencher and reporter dye are now physically separated, there is an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. The fluorescent signal increases with each cycle as additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes. During each PCR cycle, the fluorescent intensity is monitored by the real-time instrument, the SmartCycler II (time to results, including extraction, is approximately 3\u20133.5 hr for each test run).",

In response, in May 2009 the CDC received an EUA for a molecular-based IVD device that detected the 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus. As of manuscript preparation date, March 2010, EUA has been granted for several modifications to the initial CDC test, 13 additional molecular-based tests, and a DFA reagent from Diagnostic Hybrids.

Most laboratories do not have the expertise and resources to perform extensive in-house validation studies for laboratory-developed tests as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and/or required by CLIA-88, state regulatory agencies, and the College of American Pathologists [reviewed in 42]. The cost to perform a comprehensive laboratory validation of a laboratory-developed test is highly variable and depends on numerous factors, such as the type of assay, (eg, qualitative or quantitative), number of analytes included in the test (eg, singleplex or multiplex), type(s) and number of clinical sample(s), indications for testing (eg, diagnosis, prognosis, or monitoring), technical time to perform studies, and federal and state regulatory requirements. In our laboratory, the development and validation of a laboratory-developed test has cost on average between $20,000 and $50,000 per analyte. FDA-approved/cleared NAATs only require laboratory verification of some of the performance characteristics and a smaller clinical sample correlation study, compared with laboratory-developed tests (Table 3), thereby saving the laboratory considerable cost and technical time. The regulatory requirements for ongoing quality assurance monitoring are also fewer for FDA-approved/cleared NAATs than for laboratory-developed tests [42].

Although it is appropriate to bill for each target present in a multiplex assay, the use of the same CPT code multiple times for a single test can be problematic. For example, many laboratory or hospital billing systems do not recognize multiple similar CPTs for a single test and will only drop 1 CPT code charge. Some insurance payors will cover only the charge of the first CPT code, and there are also limitations on how many times per day a similar CPT code can be billed. As a result, reimbursement for a highly multiplexed assay could be limited to 1 charge, thereby significantly increasing the costs to the laboratory and decreasing test profitability. Under these circumstances and with pressure to reduce medical costs, many administrators will not approve the implementation of this testing if reimbursement is questionable.

Therefore, laboratories are constantly under pressure to expand testing and meet the demands of their clinical staff and their diverse patient populations. To do this, laboratories must provide clinically relevant, high-quality, cost-effective NAATS that are preferably FDA approved/cleared. As we move forward, we request that the FDA work closely with such organizations as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society for Microbiology, with laboratory directors, and with IVD device manufacturers so that this goal can be met. The labor-intensive, complex methods and platforms of yesterday have evolved into simpler, user friendly versions that can be applicable to all health care settings. We encourage the FDA to allow the submission process to evolve in a similar manner. No longer are the old \u201cgold standards\u201d of culture applicable, and new ways to evaluate these tests must be considered [44] so that accurate performance characteristics can be determined in a cost-effective manner. The latter is especially true for low-volume but highly relevant assays, such as quantitative NAATs for transplantation monitoring. In a reasonable and clear regulatory environment, the IVD device manufacturers will succeed in bringing their NAATS through the approval process.",
