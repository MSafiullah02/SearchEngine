Though transmission is suspected to occur primarily through respiratory droplets, fecal shedding has also been demonstrated through identification of viral RNA and live virus in stool samples [10]. Toilets have also been contaminated with the virus [11]. Molecular studies suggest that the coronavirus uses the plasma membrane ectoenzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) for cell entry, with binding of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein to cellular receptors via S protein priming by host cell proteases [12]. ACE2 is heavily expressed in the luminal GI tract [13], where it is thought to be involved with amino acid transport (Fig. 3) [14]. A case report has demonstrated the presence of virus presence in gastric, duodenal, and rectal tissue [15].",

Furthermore, the expression of ACE2 may be increased in the inflamed gut of IBD patients, which could theoretically lead to increased entry of the virus into the host [16]. At this time, all available evidence does not suggest IBD patients are at greater risk for acquiring COVID-19 [17]. In a study out of an IBD center in Bergamo, Italy, an epicenter for COVID-19, no patients in a cohort of 522 patients with IBD developed COVID-19 between February 19 and March 23, 2020 [18], close to the pandemic peak in northern Italy. 22% of this cohort was on immunosuppressive therapies including thiopurines, methotrexate, or steroids, and 16% were on a biologic agent (infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab or golimumab). During this same time period, 479 patients without any history of IBD were admitted to the hospital in this region due to COVID-19. At this time, the risk of acquiring COVID-19 is not thought to be any different than the general population. It is not recommended that patients discontinue IBD-related therapy due to the potential risk of developing COVID-19. At this time, there are no guidelines regarding testing of asymptomatic high-risk patients with IBD for SARS-CoV-2. However, some experts believe that for the time being, patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to initiating biologic therapy [19].",

This overreaction results in a cytokine release syndrome, characterized by the hyper-activation of T cells and massive production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 [20\u201322], which can affect the lungs. The result may be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. While two IL-6 inhibitors (toclizumab and sarilumab) are undergoing clinical study in COVID-19 patients [23, 24], whether IBD therapies may protect against cytokine release syndrome is as of now, a provocative, but unproven hypothesis [25]. Data from China and Europe regarding the outcomes of IBD patients who do develop COVID-19 are quite limited for answering this question. Whether an international registry (SECURE-IBD [26]) collecting data on IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection may answer this question is to be determined, however, the data are periodically updated and released online at COVIDIBD.org [26].",

The authors divide the management into three categories based on presentation: IBD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2, IBD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 but without manifestations of COVID-19, and lastly IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without bowel inflammation (our patient). The International Organization of IBD has similarly published a useful guide based on expert opinion, including how to manage various IBD medications (Table 1) [17].",
