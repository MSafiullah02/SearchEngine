            "text": "If the trend mainly stems from the economic slump, as I claim, it totally depends on the future states of world economies and whether the society\u2019s unrest continues. Considering my argument that the 2008 crisis increased the authoritarian tendencies, a plausible question would be whether these tendencies will continue in the future. I think it would depend on the frequency of the future crises. The bad news is that some economists think that the frequency of financial crises has been increasing (Reid et al. 2017). Moreover, their duration and impact have also been increasing. This would, in turn, mean that we shall encounter more active governments with increasing frequencies. This would definitely boost the autocratic tendencies. For example, at the time I was finalizing this book in March 2020, coronavirus was posing a serious threat to global economies and every nation was taking extreme measures to prevent possible undesired outcomes of the pandemic. The current development of the measures shows signs of what we experienced in the past: Governments have all the excuses to exaggerate the policies for their favor and do not stop where they have to. This would in turn, as we saw before, increase autocratic tendencies and decrease individual liberties and privacy. The good news is that society is learning how to respond to these autocratic practices. Several academic researchers point out the active need of society for a better future. Raghuram Rajan calls this Third Pillar (the first two pillars are said to be state and market) ( Rajan 2019). MIT professors Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson state this as follows: \u201cIf the state and the elites become too powerful, we end up with the Despotic Leviathan. If they fall behind, we get Absent Leviathan. So we need both state and society running together and neither getting the upper hand\u201d (Acemoglu and Robinson 2019, 40). If society gets more involved in how the country is managed, things might be different. A recent Turkish rap song with hashtag #susamam (I can\u2019t stay silent) which went viral in September 2019 is a great example of this societal unrest. Twenty Turkish musicians point to violations of the rule of law in Turkey, together with several other problems. However, it takes time for society to get organized, especially in traditionally strongman-loving societies like Turkey.",

Google\u2019s apps are even predicting what their users are going to do. One day I was asking a friend to meet at Starbucks in an hour. When I opened the Google Map, it automatically suggested the route to the closest Starbucks. Our conversations, as well as our web searches, might have been tracked by tech companies. It is becoming easier to control the masses by means of apps. This provides governments with a great incentive to control and collaborate with tech companies. The Wall Street Journal reports that 95 percent of young adults on the internet use a Facebook product, and Amazon accounts for 75 percent of electronic book sales. Google absorbed 42.2 percent of online ad spending in 2017 (eMarketer 2017), making $35 billion; Google and Apple provide 99% of mobile phone operating systems, while Apple and Microsoft Corp. supply 95% of desktop operating systems (Ip 2018). As the companies get bigger and stronger, governments would have more incentives to either control them or collaborate with them to control the masses.",
