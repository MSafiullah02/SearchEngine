Fake news have become a powerful tool to manipulate public opinion, especially during major events. In particular, the massive spread of fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments and companies to fight against missinformation. In this context, the ability to link multiple accounts or profiles that spread such malicious content on the Internet while hiding in anonymity would enable proactive identification and blacklisting. Behavioral biometrics can be powerful tools in this fight. In this work, we have analyzed how the latest advances in keystroke biometric recognition can help to link behavioral typing patterns in experiments involving 100,000 users and more than 1 million typed sequences. Our proposed system is based on Recurrent Neural Networks adapted to the context of content deanonymization. Assuming the challenge to link the typed content of a target user in a pool of candidate profiles, our results show that keystroke recognition can be used to reduce the list of candidate profiles by more than 90%. In addition, when keystroke is combined with auxiliary data (such as location), our system achieves a Rank-1 identification performance equal to 52.6% and 10.9% for a background candidate list composed of 1K and 100K profiles, respectively.",

Facebook introduced for example a context option that provides background information for the sources of articles in its News Feed, and Twitter has professional fact checkers to identify false content [14, 22] .

In the context of the fight against fake news, de-anonymization is useful to link multiple profiles belonging to the same user who is generating fake contents. Once detected, these users can be blacklisted based on their profile, MAC address, IP address, or other account data. However, these safeguards can be circumvented by creating a new account, changing device, or using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Biometric technologies such as keystroke dynamics can be used to mitigate this circumvention. Data de-anonymization can cover any type of data, from text to audio, image, or video, being therefore a very challenging task [3, 24, 26] . Popular examples in this line are DeepFakes, which refer to deep learning based techniques able to create fake videos by swapping the face of a person with the face of another person [27] . In this work we focus in content that has been typed using a traditional keyboard (i.e. text).",

Sec. IV describes the experimental protocol, while in Sec. V we present the results. Sec. VI discusses the limitations and privacy concerns. Finally, Sec. VII draws the conclusions. Keystroke biometric systems are commonly placed into two categories: fixed-text, where the keystroke sequence typed by the user is prefixed, such as a username or password, and freetext, where the keystroke sequence is arbitrary, such as writing an email or transcribing a sentence with typing errors. Freetext systems must therefore consider different text content between training and testing. Biometric recognition systems can be applied for verification or identification task. Verification implies a 1:1 comparison to determine if the biometric sample belongs to the claimed identity. Identification implies 1:N comparisons to determine the identity of the biometric sample from a pool of candidates. Biometric authentication algorithms based on keystroke dynamics for desktop and laptop keyboards have been predominantly studied for verification tasks in fixedtext scenarios, achieving accuracies higher than 95% [18, 19] . Approaches based on sample alignment (e.g. Dynamic Time Warping) [18] , Manhattan distances [15] , digraphs [6] , and statistical models (e.g. Hidden Markov Models) [4] have achieved the best results in fixed-text verification.",

Their results worsened from 90% to 23% of correct classification rates when they changed both users profiles and test samples from fixed-text to free-text. Gunetti and Picardi [11] extended the previous algorithm to n-graphs. They calculated the duration of n-graphs common between training and testing and defined a distance function based on the duration and order.

De-anonymization is achieved by comparing the typing characteristics of the anonymous and the verified contents using the biometric patterns associated to the keystroke dynamics derived from these timing sequences. Fig. 1 presents the architecture of our proposed approach. The Anonymous typed content is first characterized according to the keystroke dynamics x A (A for Anonymous) associated to the sequences of time events t and keycodes k. A Recurrent Neural Network is used to project the timing and keycode sequences into a feature space trained for keystroke verification. The generated feature vector f(x A ) is characterized by the individual typing behavior of the anonymous subject. The feature vector f(x A ) is then matched with each of the i feature vectors f(x V i ) of a Verified content database B (the \"background\"), composed of N = #B profiles. The result of the matching process is a ranked list with the N profiles ordered by similarity to the anonymous subject.",

Keystroke dynamics, as biometric data, must be processed according to appropriate technical and organizational methodologies. The proposed de-anonymization based on keystroke behaviors is a powerful tool that can help in the fight against missinformation. But at the same time, the missuses of this technology arise important concerns related to data protection and user privacy. In addition to the identification accuracy studied in the paper, a concrete application of the ideas developed here should also consider and evaluate a secure storage of the biometric templates, and other modules for privacy preservation [7] . The balance is delicate in this case, as we should aim to de-anonymize problematic subjects while preserving the privacy rights and freedom of speech of the overall population at the same time. Careful consideration of such security and privacy aspects is out of the scope of the present paper and can be investigated elsewhere [13, 21] .",

The fight against missinformation requires new tools, and the COVID-19 pandemic has showed the necessity to develop new technologies and policies to reduce the spread of fake content. Keystroke recognition can be used as a tool to link multiple profiles belonging to the same typist based on his typing behavior. We have evaluated a system based on Recurrent Neural Networks in experiments involving 100,000 users and more than 1M keystroke sequences. Our results suggest the potential of this technology to link multiple texts typed by the same user by leveraging personal typist patterns. The performance achieved varies depending on the number of background profiles, with Rank-1 identification accuracy ranging from 10.9% to 52.6% and Rank-50 from 48.4% to 99.5 when auxiliary information is available.",
