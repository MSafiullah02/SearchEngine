One ICU, with 10 beds (ICU\u2010A), collected swabs from 17 December 2008 to 30 November 2009, and the other, with six beds (ICU\u2010B), collected swabs from 22 January 2009 to 30 August 2009. Only throat swabs taken upon admission were included, and no additional virological analyses were requested from sample material sent for bacterial diagnostics. Throat swabs were chosen for the study due to the non\u2010invasive nature of sample collection, combined with minimal discomfort for the patients and an acceptable sensitivity. The inclusion of patients was based upon the assessment of the attending physicians. Inclusion criteria were wide, as respiratory viruses do not always appear as a uniform clinical picture. A patient was included if any sign of respiratory distress or failure was apparent, including exacerbation in COPD or asthma, and pneumonia. Patients with fever, if accompanied by uncompensated congestive heart failure or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, metabolic acidosis, sepsis or cardiac arrest, were also included.",

There are for instance different approaches and opinions on which sample material is most suitable for identification of respiratory agents, and also on how proper sample collection is verified. Previously administered antibiotics may influence the results markedly, eventually disguising pathogens and promoting selection of other microorganisms present in the patient. The presence of bacteria or fungi in samples from the airways in ICU\u2010settings will only rarely be considered diagnostic for a given infection, as most of the isolations could represent both an infection and a colonizing organism. Even in blood cultures, the microorganism detected may not necessarily represent an infection. The results in our study illustrate both issues, as only 36% of the respiratory isolates and 23% of isolates detected in blood cultures from virus\u2010negative patients were considered to be clinically relevant for the respiratory disease.",

Influenza A was the virus most frequently detected, followed by RSV, which supports previous results 12, 21, 22. The detection of respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses in the presence of acute respiratory symptoms have previously been shown to cause severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation 5, 8, 22, 23. The other respiratory viruses detected in our study, such as rhinoviruses, RSV and hMPV, have also been shown by several studies to cause significant symptoms, morbidity and potential need of intensive care treatment 6, 24. Most of the respiratory viruses detected in the multiplex PCR presented show seasonal variations of frequency 25, 26, 27. Although some weeks were missing at the beginning of the influenza season in our study, the main seasons for the different viruses were covered. Any seasonal variations of the viruses during the study period should be accommodated. The timing of the sample collection could have interfered in the number of positive samples if performed late in the clinical course of the infection, but 75% of the samples were taken within 4 days of admission with acute respiratory disease.",

Several studies throughout the last century have demonstrated the association between respiratory viruses and bacterial infections 3, 28, 29, 30. The most frequent combination of virus and bacteria in our study was influenza A and S. aureus, which is a well\u2010described relationship. Most patients were admitted either directly at the ICU or less than 3 days after hospital admission, which makes nosocomial infection or selection of opportunistic agents less likely. Influenza\u2010positive patients frequently had a coincident finding in respiratory cultures, of which two thirds of the microorganisms were considered clinically significant and likely to represent a severe super\u2010infection. A recent study reported similar results; approximately half of influenza\u2010patients presenting with a coinfection 12. These findings demonstrate that neither bacteriological nor virological analyses should stand alone. In this study, patients with a virus plus a microbiological agent tended to be admitted and ventilated for a similar period as the virus\u2010negative, bacteria/fungi\u2010positive patients. This could indicate a more severe morbidity caused by the combination of agents. We found no association between the number of deaths and different combinations of microbiological agents, but a large frequency of pneumonia was noted even among virus\u2010only infected patients. The findings are in line with some recent studies 12, 31, 32, and partly supported by a study on nearly 210.000 ICU\u2010patients which found a strong association between being infected with viruses and bacteria during the same hospitalization and developing septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 8.

This supports the fact that interpreting current practice microbiological analyses is difficult in ICU\u2010patients. This was also recently pointed out in a study investigating biomarkers in bronchoalveolar lavages for diagnosing respiratory viral infections 33. The clinical picture of respiratory tract infections in ICU is further complicated by the fact that severe infections with focus outside of the respiratory system may also result in pulmonary congestion and infiltrates due to ARDS. These changes may resemble pneumonia, but the pathogen may not be found in either the respiratory secretions or in the blood. Improving the sensitivity of microbiological analyses with molecular methods, or adding other detection methods or biomarker analyses may reduce the number of severely ill patients with undetermined aetiology of their respiratory disease.",

A more comprehensive diagnostic programme than today's practice, including a wider use of molecular methods in bacteriology, could possibly result in more accurate diagnoses and a reduction in the use of empirical broad\u2010spectrum antibiotic treatment. In greater perspectives, this could contribute to relieving the increasing issues with antibiotic resistance.
