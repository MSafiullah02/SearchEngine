It is thus important to disseminate knowledge on urban policy to the public. Ordinances (local laws) are often publicly available, e.g. [3], yet many residents view them as impervious due to complex legalese. Thus, ordinances need mining to discover knowledge that a wide spectrum of users can comprehend. A related aspect is public opinion on social media. It is important to gauge public reactions on issues related to ordinances by opinion mining. The results of mining ordinances and their public reactions need dissemination to be easily accessible and understandable. This is the focus of our overall research [4, 5]. We address ordinances from publicly available sites, and reactions to them expressed on Twitter. We conduct mining on these to discover knowledge on how well the ordinances enhance the given area into a Smart City, and to what extent the public is satisfied with the ordinances.",

We use CSK sources, along with the well-known word2vec [7] for ordinance-tweet mapping, and with sentiment polarity classification for mining. Based on this, we develop an Ordinance-Tweet Mining App, to disseminate the analysis. In this paper, we describe the app development using principles from HCI (Human Computer Interaction), e.g. [8, 9]. We explain the mining of ordinances and tweets leading to useful legislative information disseminated by the app. This app provides QA (Question Answering) on interesting issues in urban policy. It is user-friendly, including interactive graphs and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) that facilitate comprehension by the public and experts. Targeted users, including the common public and domain experts in environmental management evaluate this app. In this paper, we focus on disseminating the results of mining NYC ordinances available on its public legislative council website [3]. We collect tweets from NYC through location-based data available on Twitter. We consider NYC since it is the financial capital of the USA, one of the major metropolitan cities in the world and a leading Smart City (see Fig. 1) [3, 10]. As per world rankings, NYC is among the top 25 smart cities worldwide [11]. This is a good achievement. Yet there is scope for enhancement. We address this in the mining of ordinances and tweets, and in the corresponding app.",

            "text": "In our earlier works, we propose methods for mining of ordinances from websites [4, 12] and furthermore, the mining of public opinions about them expressed on Twitter [5, 13, 14]. We use these methods for ordinance-tweet mining within NYC and conduct evaluation as included in our papers [4, 5, 12\u201314]. As stated in [5, pp. 1721\u20131722], \u201can important focus in our work is to determine to what extent such ordinances contribute to establishing the relevant urban region as a Smart City. Hence, we categorize ordinances based on their pertinent Smart City Characteristics (SCCs). We aim to connect ordinances to relevant tweets by drawing on their semantic relatedness. This is non-trivial, as ordinances and tweets both involve highly intricate and rather heterogeneous natural language, so simple keyword matching does not suffice. We propose a two-step approach for mapping that exploits the transitive nature of the connection between ordinances and tweets considering their relationship with SCCs. Specifically, the transitive property we invoke is that: if the ordinance relates to a given SCC and any tweet relates to the same SCC, then the ordinance bears a connection to the tweet. This approach is proposed because classical sources of SCC data e.g., [1, 2] are finite and are restricted to a limited set of identifying features that can be relied upon for mapping. Thus, this transitive approach is more feasible than attempting to directly relate a seemingly infinite number of tweets to ordinances from various websites. As a first step, we discover connections between SCCs and ordinances using classical SCC sources [2] guided by commonsense knowledge (CSK) from web-based repositories [15, 16]. In the second step, we consider the mapping of tweets to SCCs, again drawing on such CSK. This approach then enables us to directly relate ordinances and the tweets to the pertinent aspects of Smart Cities and also sets the stage for sentiment polarity classification\u201d [5, pp. 1721\u20131722]. Based on this, our mapping algorithm is Algorithm 1, as presented herewith [5].",

Accordingly, words are classified as positive, negative or neutral based on polarity of terms. In SentiWordNet, different meanings exhibited by the same word can have different sentiment scores. For example, the word estimable when relating to computation has a neutral score of 0.0, while the same word in the sense of deserving respect is assigned a positive score of 0.75. The process we deploy for sentiment analysis of tweets constitutes a semi-supervised learning method using SentiWordNet. Through this, subtle human judgment through commonsense in understanding emotions is embodied in the mining processes with specific reference to context\u201d [13, pp. 841\u2013842]. Accordingly, our algorithm for polarity classification of tweets is Algorithm 2 as presented next [13].",

Note that the selection of relevant tweets and also the mapping of tweets to their respective ordinances is guided by CSK. We construct SCC-based Domain KBs (Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases) [5, 13, 14] derived from WebChild [16] and WordNet [15], to filter out unwanted tweets as a first step, followed by the mapping of tweets to relevant ordinances using SCCs as a next step\u201d [13, pp. 841\u2013842]. We start mapping groups of ordinances to tweets [5, 13], and then connect them with each other at finer levels of granularity [14] by mapping individual ordinances to tweets. This is via ordinance KBs in addition to SCC KBs, incorporating pragmatics and semantics through CSK and domain knowledge respectively [14]. The mining in our work is on ordinances and tweets from NYC, using a public council site [3] and Twitter location-based data. The results of the SCC-based ordinance analysis and tweet polarity classification comprise significant inputs for building the Ordinance-Tweet Mining App. We now describe its design process.",

An important concept in HCI is Fitt\u2019s Law [9, pp. 518\u2013519], i.e., \u201cT = k log2\n(D/S + 1.0) where T = time to move the pointer to a target, D = distance between the pointer and the target, S = size of the target, k is a constant of approximately 200 ms/bit\u201d. We incorporate Fitt\u2019s Law in our app design. Thus, we design items in the app such that they are big enough to enable users to spot them fast, especially as navigation proceeds further from the opening screen. Yet, these items are small enough to fit on the required screens, and hence users do not need to spend much time while searching.",

Mockups are multiple designs created by interviews with \u201cstakeholders\u201d that give an overview of the blueprint of the app [8]. Stakeholders in HCI terminology are various influential groups such as domain experts who have a thorough knowledge of the field; students/working professionals involved in providing data; and end-users ranging from novice to expert, and casual to frequent [8]. Among the mockups, we select the best designs for the app layout and screens. Other HCI aspects we incorporate are the simplicity and efficiency of the interface [20]. These include navigation, the time spent to find an answer to a question asked by the user, and the analytical graphs displayed. Considering HCI, some principles used in the app adhere to the guidelines of Google\u2019s material design [19] to ensure that the app is up to date with the current and latest software, and to warrant that the app runs smoothly without errors or bugs. Another HCI aspect is a \u201cmetaphor\u201d [9]. The term metaphor refers to conceptualization of actions, typically for the interface. For example, a shopping cart is an interface metaphor used for checkout in online shopping. We incorporate metaphors in our app for various purposes, e.g. to depict different ordinance departments and smart city characteristics.",

Also known as the \u201cTim Tebow Law\u201d [25], this allows homeschooled children to participate in public school extracurricular activities. Candy Lightner founded the \u201cMothers against Drunk Driving (MADD)\u201d organization to ensure sterner laws against drunk driving [26]. Due to the media attention this organization received with Candy\u2019s story, it raised more awareness of driving responsibly. Likewise, our Ordinance-Tweet Mining App, the first of its kind, is likely to play an important role in making the public more aware of legislative policies and take action needed for enhancement. This concept fits the realm of Smart Governance [1, 2], a characteristic of Smart Cities that leverages greater transparency in governing processes via more public involvement.",

[28] conduct sentiment analysis of data from Twitter on political scenarios, urban events etc. As stated in [28, p. 57], the \u201cproposed approach entails a hybrid learning method for classification of tweets based on a Bayesian probabilistic method for sentence level models given partially labeled training data\u201d. The advantage is that the approach is semi-supervised, and works even with partly labeled data. Nuortimo [29] studies social media data from multiple platforms to understand public reactions for a system called Case Carbon Capture and Storage, to control carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that the overall reactions are positive. This study indicates that social media mining could be a great tool to measure public awareness and acceptance for topics related to energy and climate. Huang et al. [30] assess disaster analysis of historical and future events. They gather social media, remote sensing and Wikipedia data, performing spatial analysis and social media mining.

AI can help record car activity, foot traffic, types of shoppers that go to different retailers, their preferences, availability of parking spots etc. These are minor details yet they make big impacts to create efficient solutions [18]. AI can contribute to autonomous and semi-autonomous driving through incorporation of CSK-based techniques for enhanced decision-making [6, 32]. AI can play a role in augmenting object detection for Smart Mobility in Smart Cities with neural models, deep learning, CSK and adversarial datasets [6, 33, 35]. Another major aspect is AI in lighting. NYC has bright lights, which imply significant energy consumption. Thus, if lamppost design occurs with sensors, these can adjust their brightness depending on the amount of traffic within the area. In some cities such as Amsterdam, canal lights dim and brighten based on pedestrian usage [2]. Likewise, AI can contribute to several aspects of Smart Cities [34]. Our work in this paper is a step in this direction, using HCI-based app design and disseminating the results of mining ordinances along with their public reactions. Hence, this paper makes an impact on Smart Governance in Smart Cities.",

Through this app, users from various backgrounds can obtain quick and easy access to legislative information. Via the app the public can make better decisions and contributions, e.g. by understanding policies and public reactions, they can participate city council committees, or support their region through financial means and community outreach. In addition, this app can provide decision support to lawmakers by providing ubiquitous information, and can enhance the scope of study for researchers through future issues emerging from the work here. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first ever Ordinance-Tweet Mining App. While this app focuses on NYC in particular, it can foster the development of similar or related apps for other cities, by reuse of the approaches and data with modification.",

This constitutes part of our ongoing research. In general, our work in this paper makes a broader impact on Smart Governance.",
