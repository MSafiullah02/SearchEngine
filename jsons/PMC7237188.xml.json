Of 518 papers identified, we found 35 publications which included original clinical data from patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, primarily reported from China (66%) and Italy (14%). We identified three studies that described the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the USA. However, two of these studies were small (fewer than 25 patients each) and the third study, while larger (n=121), reported only summary statistics.\nAdded value of this study\nWe prospectively characterised the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of 257 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in New York City over the first month of the city's outbreak. Consistent with reports from Italy and China, older age and cardiopulmonary comorbidities were associated with increased mortality. Novel findings in this study include determining independent associations between biomarkers for inflammation (interleukin-6) and thrombosis (D-dimer) and mortality, as well as identifying a high incidence of critical illness among racial and ethnic minorities in the current epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengths of this study include prospective and complete collection of detailed clinical data and outcomes, and use of multivariable, time-varying analyses to quantify independent risk factors for in-hospital death in one of the largest studies to date of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the USA.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nCritical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.\n",

All critically ill patients were admitted to either a high-dependency unit or ICU; patients requiring non-invasive respiratory support were admitted to high-dependency units while those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were admitted to ICUs. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection was done using RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. Testing was performed by the New York State Department of Health from March 2 to March 10, 2020, after which testing capacity was developed by clinical microbiology laboratories at NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals.

We prospectively collected data on management interventions delivered during hospitalisation including initiation and duration of mechanical ventilation, administration of advanced therapies for acute respiratory failure (neuromuscular blocking agents, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, prone-positioning ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), vasopressor agents, renal replacement therapy, antibacterial agents, antiviral agents, and immunomodulatory agents (IL-6 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids).",

We created Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence plots. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for death using the Cox proportional hazards model. We measured time-to-event in days from the date of hospital admission to the date of in-hospital death. We included nine independent variables in our multivariable Cox model that we considered relevant to in-hospital mortality. We chose this number of variables considering the total number of deaths in our study, to avoid overfitting in the model. We included IL-6 and D-dimer concentrations because there is emerging evidence of dysregulated immune activation and coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19, and interest in treating this patient population with targeted immunomodulatory therapies and anticoagulants.12, 13 We included age and sex, as older age and male sex have been associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19.6, 7 We included symptom duration before hospital presentation because delayed initiation of supportive care might affect clinical outcomes and illness duration might affect host immune-inflammatory and thrombotic responses. We included specific comorbidity variables (hypertension, chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, and diabetes) as these variables were significantly associated with mortality in univariable analyses. We also tested a separate multivariable Cox model including Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score as a covariable to evaluate the association between our independent variables of interest and in-hospital mortality, while adjusting for the initial severity of illness. We confirmed the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models using the Schoenfeld residuals test. All analyses were done using Stata (version 16; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).",

The sudden surge of critically ill patients admitted with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome initially outpaced our capacity to provide prone-positioning ventilation, which was only performed in three of eight ICUs at our institution at the start of the outbreak. We have since expanded our capacity for prone-positioning ventilation by deploying dedicated proning teams to all ICUs, including non-traditional ICU locations. The low volume of ECMO used during the study period is primarily a reflection of the low number of patients within our hospital system meeting criteria after initiating other therapies, such as lung-protective IMV and prone-positioning ventilation. As an ECMO referral center for regional hospitals, we received a moderate-to-high volume of ECMO referrals during that period, the majority of which were optimised with conventional management strategies and did not ultimately meet criteria for ECMO or were excluded on the basis of low probability of benefit.",

Third, we collected data using a globally harmonised, WHO-endorsed case record form. Fourth, we augmented collection of standard clinical and laboratory data with clinically and pathologically relevant biomarkers, concentrations of which were available for nearly all patients.

First, our study took place in two hospitals in northern Manhattan, potentially limiting generalisability to hospital settings elsewhere in New York City, especially in terms of the demographic characteristics of the patient population. Specifically, our cohort included a high proportion of Hispanic or Latino and black or African American patients who are known to have higher prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities that may make social distancing and access to care more difficult.29 Studies among more racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse cohorts are needed to confirm our findings. Despite these limitations, our sites included both a large quaternary referral hospital and a smaller, community-based hospital, thereby increasing generalisability to other clinical settings. Second, our analyses incorporated outcome data collected through April 28, 2020. As vital status is not yet known for patients who remained hospitalised after this date, the 39% mortality reported here represents the minimum in-hospital case fatality rate for our cohort. Third, patients presented to the hospital at varying times in their illness course, which could have affected their clinical course and outcomes. To mitigate the potential effect of this variance on our analyses, we included time from symptom onset to hospital presentation as a covariable in our regression models. Fourth, of available biomarkers, we included IL-6 and D-dimer in our multivariable models because of the pathophysiological and treatment implications. We did not analyse serial concentrations of these and other biomarkers, which might fluctuate considerably over the course of the illness.",
