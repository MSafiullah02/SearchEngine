In addition, the presence of rarely used codons for arginine (AGA) and leucine (ATA) may affect the completion of the translation and cause the expression of truncated proteins18,21\u201323. Improved expression was achieved by implementing different strategies such as inserting sequences used frequently in E. coli for ATA and AGA tRNAs18, reducing growth temperature24,25, introducing chaperones, reducing acetate expression, and introducing rare amino acids and codon optimization24,26,27. An overlooked option is the possibility of an interaction between the expressed recombinant proteins and the host cellular machinery (e.g., RNA degradation and inhibition of cell growth caused by the expression of human RNase L containing \u201cankyrin repeat\u201d motifs in E. coli)28.",

It was recently shown that certain recombinant proteins (e.g., proteins of a different nature like soluble (xylanase and GFP) or inclusion body (Interferon \u03b2)) based on cellular localization (e.g., secreted proteins (NprE, XynA, Usp45, TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase), membrane proteins (LmrA and XylP), or lipoproteins (MntA and YcdH)) caused different host cellular responses when overexpressed29,30. It is possible by using next generation sequencing tools to quantify the gene expression profile at different growth and production phases in order to identify changes related to substrate consumption, central carbon metabolism, and energy metabolism based on the sequence and structural features. Here we report that expressing C. difficile rARU from E. coli in a restricted dissolved oxygen (DO) supply condition is 27-fold higher than expression obtained when regular conditions of unrestricted DO are implemented. We hypothesized that the presence of cell wall binding profiles in the rARU is the cause. Log and late-log phase samples from cultivations at restricted and unrestricted DO were investigated by using transcriptomics and proteomics. The information obtained suggests that the cell wall binding segments of the rARU have a role in gene expression by interacting with the cellular E. coli proteins.",

Particularly important is the down-regulation of the RNA polymerases (rpoB -5.67-fold, rpoC -4.46-fold, rpoZ -3.39-fold and rpoA -6.58) which are essential for transcription initiation. In contrast, except for rpoD which was down-regulated, rpoA, rpoC, and rpoZ were up-regulated at restricted DO (1.2-fold, 1.0-fold, and 1.31-fold respectively). Since the translation process depends on the availability of ribosomes, amino acids, aminoacyl tRNA, and ATP molecules, it is not surprising that the genes associated with these processes were also differentially down-regulated in the unrestricted DO. This group includes 52 DEGs related to ribosome formation, 19 related to aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, 44 associated amino acid biosynthesis, and 17 involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The down-regulation of genes associated with energy related metabolism, central metabolism, and ribosomal RNA were previously shown to be associated with the cellular stress response (CSR) generated during recombinant protein overexpression35,36. The down-regulation of the above-mentioned processes displays a behavior that supports the lower amount of rARU expressed at unrestricted DO. Previous reports showed that the presence of the rarely used codons of arginine and leucine in clostridial proteins is a possible bottleneck in their translations18,21,22.

We observed that rARU transcript accumulation was highest only when the culture was grown at a restricted DO concentration. It is very likely that this unusual expression condition is an indication that a special gene sequence and structure of the produced protein are related to the expression. Therefore, significant production was possible only by applying restricted DO growth strategy. A possible reason for this special phenomenon was the presence of cell wall binding repeats motifs that allowed transcription and translation at restricted DO and therefore increased its expression at these conditions. The role of the heterologous protein sequence in the metabolic toxicity due to overexpression of recombinant proteins was reported, but no analysis was performed to understand the functional features associated with the sequence and how it interacted with the host cellular machinery54\u201356. This report demonstrated a connection between rARU expression and restricted DO, which presents the possibility of the improved expression of other recombinant proteins of anaerobic origin or of proteins that are associated with cell wall binding repeat profiles.
