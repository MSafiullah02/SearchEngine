On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement characterizing COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic and warning governments to take expedient action [3]. This global health crisis has already disrupted all aspects of society, with safety and economic concerns radiating across the world. As part of the international collaboration to flatten the number of emerging cases, multiple organizations have released guidelines related to the cessation of elective surgical procedures [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. In light of the increased utilization of healthcare associated with the disease, these guidelines have left providers and stakeholders increasingly concerned regarding the true financial impact COVID-19 will have on the healthcare system [8,9].",

Although the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided these funds to hospitals and healthcare providers [12,13], the rapid decrease in elective surgical procedures will undoubtedly continue to economically impact healthcare systems that previously relied on these stable sources of revenue. Additionally, hospitals must prepare for the surge in procedural demand expected to follow the current pandemic. While there is limited information available for providers and governing bodies at this time, understanding how public interest for elective procedures has changed during the recent crisis can help policy makers understand these potential future financial losses and surges in healthcare demand. Given that total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains one of the most commonly performed elective procedures in the United States (US) [14], interest in TJA likely serves as an appropriate model to obtain this information.",

The platform is useful for describing both geographic and temporal patterns in the popularity search terms. The GSVI is a normalized index, relating the volume of searches within a given region or time period against the total volume of Google searches within the same setting. GSVI values are scaled from 1 to 100, with a value of 50 representing half the search popularity as a value of 100. This service has previously been used to analyze public interest in orthopedic surgery, elective surgical procedures in other surgical subspecialties[[22], [23], [24]], and a variety of other clinical services [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. The terms \u201cKnee Replacement,\u201d \u201cHip Replacement,\u201d and \u201cOrthopedic Surgeon\u201d were determined to be the most searched and therefore, were included in our analysis. Among the general public, these keywords were discovered to have a much higher usage than terms such as \u201cArthroplasty\u201d or \u201cTotal Joint Replacement.\u201d We implemented searches for both \u201cOrthopaedic\u201d and \u201cOrthopedic\u201d to expand the scope of our analysis but determined the latter keyword to have an over 16-fold higher utilization in the US. To account for the current shift of elective surgeries, the string \u201celective surgery cancellation\u201d was analyzed.",

States were then stratified by the severity of the public health policies adopted by local governments as well as by U.S. Census Region to assess for regional variation [39,40]. Changes in GSVI values were assessed for states which issued a statewide shelter-in-place warning during the month of April were compared to those that did not. Similarly, changes in GSVI values were compared between states that were either in the process of reopening or remaining closed as of May 9, 2020[41]. A two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was utilized to compare changes in GSVI values across groups of states with the threshold for significance set to p = 0.05. Variation in GSVI values by census region was assessed using a one-way ANOVA test with a significance threshold also of p = 0.05.

The 5-year average GSVI values for these search terms were 72.1, 55.2, and 63.7 respectively. To account for seasonal variation, GSVI values for April of each year between 2015 and 2020 were assessed as well (Table 1\n). For each search term, the drop in GSVI values observed during March of 2020 breeched the lower control limit, approximating three standard deviations below the five-year mean. According to standard SPC methodology, this drop signifies a non-random variation in the GSVI data. The decline was the most significant for \u201cKnee Replacement\u201d searches, followed by \u201cHip Replacement\u201d and \u201cOrthopedic Surgeon\u201d searches, respectively. A concurrent spike was apparent in March 2020 for the search term \u201cElective Surgery Cancellation,\u201d with an observable peak on March 15, 2020 (Figure 2\n).",

Specific regions experiencing a high volume of COVID-19 cases may coincide with regions where the relative public interest in elective TJA is lowest, although this pattern remains unclear. Additionally, the recent rise of unemployment, concurrent with the closure of many non-essential businesses may be useful in explaining declining interest in elective TJA. Employer-based insurance remains the primary means with which patients under the age of 65 years access important healthcare services. A wave of unemployment could potentially be accompanied by a wave of un/underinsurance, making it difficult for patients to seek necessary medical and surgical care. Conversely, a lowered interest in hip and knee replacements might be reflective at the system level, considering the possibility that patients with non-emergent healthcare needs are truly deferring care-seeking behavior to adhere to with social distancing protocols. Irrespective of the reason, these results represent a decline in elective TJA case volume and subsequent financial strain on many hospitals, particularly those serving critical-access functions.",

However, given the rapid progression of COVID-19, we would suggest that real-time data regarding its impact on current and future elective surgery remain crucial. The degree to which Google Trends data such as the GSVI truly represent current consumer behavior and sentiment around elective TJA. Notably, we were unable to capture queries related to additional search engines and could not control for the possibility of patients seeking TJA information elsewhere. Furthermore, although elderly patients are more likely to seek surgical management for osteoarthritis, it is possible that this patient population may be less accustomed to using technological services [42]. Granted that Google receives over 2 trillion queries a year [43], however, our study population likely serves as an adequate sample of those seeking health information on the internet [44].",

According to the model by Sloan et al., approximately 1.4 million TJA procedures were projected in 2020 [14]. These numbers translated to billions of US dollars in expected costs for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, as well as for hospital systems nationwide. However, now that there has been a delay in care for months, the pent-up demand for TJA will result in a greater burden on the healthcare system with subsequent delays in care, as providers attempt to catch-up with this increased need. Several prior studies have examined the impact of delays in care-seeking behavior from a variety of angles. Utilizing National Readmission Database (NRD), Schwartz et al. found that TJA incidence sharply declined at age 63, with an abrupt increase demonstrated at between ages 64 and 65 (total hip arthroplasty (THA): 30; 4%; total knee arthroplasty (TKA): 24.7%). This translated to an estimated excess cost of $55 million (range: $33-$70 million) for 4,616 pent-up TJA procedures[45]. When these findings are considered with respect to the likely decreased demand for TJA during the present pandemic, the possibility of overwhelming future costs becomes clear. Therefore, our study should encourage policy makers and providers to fashion contingency planning in order to mitigate potentially pent-up demand.",

In terms of maintaining patient access in the setting of mandatory social distancing, the implementation of telemedicine has become a viable option [46]. Given the consistent financial benefits that these platforms have demonstrated [[47], [48], [49], [50], [51]], their utilization may serve to partially reduce the lost elective revenue that healthcare systems are likely experiencing. However, a lack of nationwide parity laws related to their coverage among insurance providers has significantly been shown to limit their use [52,53]. Multiple states have already passed laws regarding expanding telehealth services for their constituents [54], and Congress recently mandated $500 million for the implementation of telehealth in Medicare patients through the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act [55]. Nevertheless, a continued and swift push for parity laws in order to ensure the wide telehealth services may very well be warranted.",

We have found a drastic decrease in the relative popularity of google searches for hip and knee replacements both nationally and worldwide. Granted that patients suffering from osteoarthritis will continue to need care after the current crisis is controlled, the possible pent-up demand could result in a greater volume and economic burden that our present healthcare system may be able to withstand. This, in turn, could translate to a bottleneck of care for many orthopaedic patients. Public interest in TJA should continue to be followed in real-time, nationally and globally, as the pandemic progresses. Further research is required to inform physicians, patients, the government, insurers, and other key stakeholders on how best to proceed through the COVID-19 pandemic. Focus should be on maintaining patient and physician safety, ensuring continued access, and analyzing preparedness for sudden fluctuations in both the supply and demand of care.",
