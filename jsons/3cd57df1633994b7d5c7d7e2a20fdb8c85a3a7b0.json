Some infants that require hospital admission for bronchiolitis will present recurrent wheezing episodes later in life (2) . Up to now, there has not been an agreement on bronchiolitis definition concerning the upper age limit, which varies between 12 and 24 months (3, 4) . Growing evidences suggest that the upper age limit should be restricted to 6 months (5) .
