The absence of any effective therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against COVID-19 making the population susceptible. As there are no vaccines available yet, it has now become a global concern and researchers all over the world are trying hard to come over with this pandemic. Due to the present crisis, massive frictional ripples have been created thus various sectors such as tourism, transportation, the supply chain of export and import, healthcare, IT industries, etc., are either reeling under pressure or in standstill phase across the borders. Therefore, there is a constant strain of science and technology to emerge with innovative solutions to mitigate the situation.",

            "text": "During the last decade, it is evident that policymakers are taking more interest in the adaptation of novel technologies and this is coming as the operationalization of technological emergence. Emerging technologies are radically novel, relatively growing, and becoming coherent and prominent over time, therefore, have a substantial impact on the socio-economic domain(s) [157] . As technology adoption rate is speeding up day by day, incremental progress has been witnessed by humans and future technologies are continuously replacing the existing work practices. Disruptive technology is a keyword coined by Clayton et al. [32] , which refers to a revolutionary change that uproots an established technology and spawns new industries, markets and value networks that eventually disrupts an existing lifestyle, thereby presenting the power to change the way we work, live, think and behave [15, 33] . We are using the term \"disruptive technology\" as an \"umbrella\" that encompasses a novel perception to see the changes in the technological usage pattern with respect to time. We are also trying to map technologies with respect to physical, digital, and biological perspectives in order to support the fight against COVID-19. Fig.1shows an example of disruptive technology over the past decades. As mentioned in the study, if we follow the trails of the disruptive technology landscape, enterprise leaders need to comprehend the nuanced interconnections among people, processes, services, and things. Following from these notions, it is essential to first understand the context [33] before initiating the utilization of any innovative technology. According to Gartner\u00e2\u0102\u0179s recent report [157] , there are certain trends that will drive significant disruption and opportunities over the next 5 to 10 years, especially in the area of infrastructure and operations [65] . A Gartner team member, D. Cearley, highlighted that strategic technology trends now surrounded into two categories: human-centric and smart-space [59] . According to an article [169] , human-centric technologies can create various opportunities and can drive disruptions in our lifestyle for the future. Human-centric approaches keep people in priority to develop solutions which can strengthen different roles within the organisations such as customers, policymakers, employees, business partners, etc. On the other hand, a smart-space is termed as a physical environment, which offers an open, connected, coordinated and intelligent ecosystem to people for their seamless interaction using the technology-enabled systems along with the more immersive, interactive and automated experience. Fig. 2 highlights the various interconnections between human-centric and smart-space technologies. COVID-19 becomes a black swan for the entire world and provokes a very strong wave of change and disruption. The growing impact of the unprecedented human tragedy is not only affecting the people's health but also hampered the functioning of several sectors, including aviation, automotive, pharmaceuticals, banking, consumer electronics, travel and tourism, among others. Thus it is high time to project emerging, future and disruptive technologies to support the above-discussed sectors and also speeding up the battle against the coronavirus. Table 1 represents the different types of disruptive technology along with the supporting emerging technologies. As an attempt to cover the broad range of emerging, future and disruptive technologies for the purpose to combat COVID-19, following are our contributions: First, we review the evolving nature of technologies, emphasized on its disruptive nature classified as a human-centric and smart-space theme. Second, we listed down individual technologies and prepared a timeline about their emergence to portray continuous evolutions along with coverage of related research work. Third, we identified technology-enabled COVID-19 use cases in all possible application domains along with thorough coverage of SWOT analysis. Fourth, we summarize the findings which can be adopted easily along with the future recommendations. Lastly, we conclude our findings with some unexplored open research questions to be addressed in the near future by the researchers.",

It is a combination of multiple machine learning (ML) techniques and artificial intelligence to progressively automate processes and augment humans. It covers all steps of automation such as to discover, analyze, design, automate, measure, monitor and re-assess. It has two components: robotic process automation (RPA) [190] and intelligent business process management suites (iBPMSs) [47] . Here RPA works as a bridge between legacy and modern systems. It supports knowledge workers on day-to-day routine and eliminates repetitive tasks by means of migrating from the present environment to the next environment with the help of tightly defined integration scripts structure and data manipulation. iBPMSs is suitable for long term processes and works as an unified solution that coordinates people, processes, machines and things. It is a collection of rules to trigger a user interface and manage the contextual work items via robust APIs. It also supports the full life cycle of business processes such as discovery, analysis, design, implementation, execution, monitoring and continuous optimization, to facilitate collaboration among citizens and professionals on iterative development and improvement of processes and decision models.

This is indicating the consumerization effect [149] , where workforces can get enhanced capabilities to contribute to a better working environment. In physical augmentation [39] , people host technological components on their bodies to improve human capabilities such as a wearable device. These components are classified as sensory augmentation (hearing, vision, perception) and biological function augmentation (exoskeletons, prosthetics). In cognitive augmentation, human abilities can be utilized for better thinking, decision making, learning and experiencing new things. Cognitive augmentation [35] correspondingly comprises brain augmentation which can be physically implanted that deals with intellectual reasoning, and genetic augmentation which covers somatic gene and cell therapy.",

Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are emerging as a powerful tool to accomplish remote socialization, illustrating experience of virtual shopping, events and conducting business meets. It is not only offering day-to-day, people-to-people interactions with minimum contact but also satisfies the consumers\u00e2\u0102\u0179 expectations of real world experience without any outer exposure and investment in terms of time and money. With this application, it is evident that this technology could aid in following the set government protocols while also continuing the personal and daily business requirements. Virtual reality (VR) technology was invented in 1957 by Morton Heilig as a multimedia device called the Sensorama [78] . However, the term \u00e2\u0102\u0178virtual reality\u00e2\u0102\u0179 was coined much later in 1987 by researcher Jaron Lanier. Virtual reality (VR) [10] is a mechanism to create a simulated environment using headsets that blend out the real world, instead of watching on a display, immersing a person in a digital 3D environment. Unlike conventional user display interfaces, VR places users inside an experience. By simulating several senses such as audio, video, touch, etc., the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world. Unlike VR, augmented reality (AR) overlays digital objects onto the real world via smartphone screens or displays, it does not create the whole artificial environment to replace real with a virtual one whereas the mixed reality (MR) is an extension of AR, where users can interact with digital objects placed in the real world (e.g. playing a holographic piano located in the room via an AR headset). Augmented means to add or enhance something and in the case of augmented reality, graphics, sounds, and touch feedback are added in real experience. Virtual intelligence (VI) [108] is an advanced term given to artificial intelligence that applies to the virtual world. It is a sophisticated program designed to provide convenience to modern computer users. Unlike conventional AI, VIs are only utilized to assist the user and process data. Some VIs may have \u00e2\u0102\u0178personality imprints\u00e2\u0102\u0179, with their behavior parameters, speech pattern and appearance based on specific individuals, although it is illegal to make VIs based on currently living people. Extended reality (XR) is a term referring to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables, where the \"X\" represents a variable for any current or future spatial computing technologies [34] . XR most commonly includes virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Fig. 15 shows the incremental growth in VR technology whereas the literature papers are considered in Table 5 . The development of VR/AR/XR must be incorporated with appropriate legal compliances.",

Presently healthcare systems are at high risk and due to increasing demand, system capacity has to be elevated in order to maintain the supply of medical hardwares (face masks, ventilators, and breathing filters, PPE kits, bubble helmets, etc.). Thus, it is essential that all around the world, the government should take extreme measures to boost productivity and enhance the supply of essential medical equipment. To fulfil these demands, three-dimensional (3D) printing can contribute positively as a disruptive digital manufacturing technology for better production and subsequently encourage the effort of hospital workers in the middle of this emergency. In 1974, David E. H. Jones laid out the concept of 3D printing [80] . It is a technique in which computers are capable of creating three-dimensional objects with raw materials (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together) [132] . Originally, it is a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. Presently, the use of 3D printing is limited and majorly used in both rapid prototyping and manufacturing. The desired objects can be of any geometry or shape and are typically produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an additive manufacturing file (AMF) (usually in sequential layers) [155] . This process is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out an object through machinery, which is capable of producing complex objects using less material compared to conventional manufacturing methods [69] . 3D printing is useful in every application domain such as medical infrastructure, drug discovery, defence system, industrial production, etc. Fig. 16 highlights the timeline of 3D printing technology and Table 6 considers related survey papers for discussion.",

Physiological identifiers relate to the composition of the user being authenticated and include facial recognition, fingerprints, finger geometry (the size and position of fingers), iris recognition, vein recognition, retina scanning, voice recognition and DNA matching. Behavioral identifiers include the unique ways in which individuals act, including recognition of typing patterns, walking gait and other gestures. Some of these behavioral identifiers can be used to provide continuous authentication instead of a single one-off authentication check. In general, contact-based physiological biometrics such as fingerprint recognition pose a health risk [166] , hence contactless biometrics seem more promising such as facial and iris recognition. Fig. 17 shows the evolution in the biometric systems along with the survey papers in Table 7 . ",

The bad part of this pandemic over people is psychological weakness like: helplessness, scareness, and frustration. Data analytics methods are used to infer the patterns from available data to decide future actions. In presence of massive incremental data of this pandemic, advanced data analytics play a vital role. The analysis of the data may also help the people to know the tentative future behavioural patterns, that may surely become the best way to reduce panic and make people feel safe and hope in the tragic \"pandemic\" time. Data analysis helps health workers, administrators and researchers to prepare action plans in combat against COVID-19. Availability of COVID-19 related massive Data is an asset that is helping forecast and understands the reach and impact of coronavirus. In contrast to earlier epidemics, to fully exploit the potential of big data analytics approaches, the present advancements in computational hardware and resources are being used by healthcare workers, scientists and epidemiologists to analyze the data. The term data analytics is the backbone of every aspect of study that drives the approach towards its desired goal. Fig. 18 illustrates the advancements achieved over the decades in the field of data analytics. With the development of big data and advent of data sources, this field has significantly evolved to address the associated challenges of real-time processing. This area of research tends to discover the hidden patterns associated with the data by means of data-centric approaches like data mining, statistical analysis, data presentation and management [81] . This mainly comprises of 2D2P analytics defined as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive, where descriptive analytics answers what happened and past performance; diagnostic analytics answers why happened i.e. finds the cause of outcome of descriptive analytics; on the other hand predictive and prescriptive analytics answers what will happen in future and what should be done respectively [16] .

Hence, 5G technology is the primary requirement to fulfill the current and future requirements. Unlike its predecessor, 5G offers greater bandwidth and higher download speed that can scale up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps). Fig. 25 highlights the evolution of wireless technologies [167] . With increased bandwidth in 5G, it can compete with other internet service providers (ISP) like cable net that is utilized in laptop or desktop devices and can also widen the scope of applications in IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) enabled regions. This quality of telecommunication can serve as a foundation of many aforementioned technologies. 5G is now recognized as a disruptive technology with its forthcoming deployment between 2020 and 2040 across the world.

Multirotor systems are a subset of rotorcraft (defined as an aircraft that uses rotary wings to generate lift) e.g. traditional helicopters. Drones use multiple small rotors, whereas hybrid systems incorporate properties of both fixed-wing and multirotor systems. A hybrid quadcopter is a perfect example of a hybrid drone. This type of drone uses multiple rotors to lift and land, whereas wings are helpful to fly for longer distances.

This reduces the overhead time of radiologists spent into the close monitoring of these images for further diagnosis. Furthermore, till now, no concrete solution is proposed to fight against COVID-19 and hence social distancing [71] is found to be the only feasible solution. Deep learning based object detection and tracking schemes are proposed, followed by statistical analysis to automate the monitoring of social distancing via surveillance footage [147] . Likewise, many frameworks are proposed that make use of sensors available on the smartphones and other wearable devices like GPS, camera, temperature, heart rate monitor, and other inertia based sensors [111] , to carefully monitor the victims of COVID-19. The data acquired is then utilized with machine learning approaches to synthesize the symptoms of the virus and later use it for its faster detection. This is so-far the quickest approach to detect COVID-19 as compared to the medical scans or kits, but is prone to false detections. With the help of above discussed works, table 18 indicates the SWOT analysis performed in the detection area of fight against COVID-19.",

The sanitization tunnels that act as disinfection spraying channels along with the thermal supervision to monitor the body temperature, ensure the hygiene maintenance of the person who was exposed to the outside environment. Though this approach is not cost effective but is necessary to sustain the hygienic surrounding in the public environment e.g. airport, malls, markets, etc. To maintain self hygiene, face shields, PPE kits and smart sanitization systems are introduced that make use of IoT devices to guide a person to follow the suggested measures properly; for instance, washing hands for 20 seconds, wearing a mask and other protective gears while going outside from home, following the social distancing order, etc. Recently, various cabinet structures like PODs are introduced to safeguard a person from getting in contact with the other in public places e.g. restaurants in Amsterdam are equipped with quarantine greenhouses [152] , isolation pods are installed in hospitals and airports, etc. Moreover, various hospitals are now equipped with bubble helmet based ventilation schemes, which is highly recommended for a patient suffering from severe respiratory syndrome than just by mere face mask [63] .

With the exhaustive survey it was observed that various contactless initiatives are undertaken that involves work from home [109] , contactless -payment |citeNP111, delivery [183] , drive-through COVID-19 testing [206] , etc. Social distancing solution is designed to combat the challenges that all essential workforces, and businesses eager to return to normal operations, are facing in the time of COVID-19. It is based on two basic concepts: passive and active. Passive approach is based on the interaction records of the workers (or any individuals) which utilizes the contact tracing in case an individual is tested positive, whereas in active approach, an alarm (via visual or audio signals) is generated for workers to adjust their current distance for following the social distancing protocol. Nowadays, there are many social distancing tools are available for automated monitoring. Landing AI [3] is a startup that provides companies with end-to-end AI platforms and has come up with a useful tool to monitor social distancing. Proximity Trace [187] is another solution that is based on device-to-device and device-to-gateway signaling without any dependency on client\u00e2\u0102\u0179s Wi-Fi or internet and location data (on site or off site). Spotr [179] also works as a safety and visibility tool for contact tracing under COVID-19 protocols. Furthermore, since we mostly contact the exposed parts of our body (eyes, ears, mouth, etc.) with our hands, many hands-free equipments are developed e.g. door openers [207] , biometric verification [84] , elevators [129] , smartphones, electrical and electronic household appliances (switch boards, fans, lights, bulbs, etc.), etc. These developments utilize the IoT enabled systems integrated with the AI technology to support the desired action.

Apparently seems to be an unending COVID-19 pandemic -individuals, organizations, nations, the whole world is affected. Thus, there is an urgency to accelerate responsible action plans to overcome this crisis and also turn it into something positive for the society at large and for generations to come. COVID-19 pandemic situation demands a serious contribution from policymakers and regulators to demonstrate legal plausibility, ethical soundness, and effectiveness of the deployment of emerging, future and disruptive technologies under time pressure. The action plan can rely upon 4 horizons: respond, reengineering, reinforce, and rebound as highlighted in Fig. 30 . In the first stage, it is highly imperative to respond proactively and act decisively in order to have the best possible use of existing and emerging technologies to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It will help to maintain continuity, productivity and mental well-being of the individuals so that they can contribute efficiently as per the need. In the case of COVID-19, this stage is either undergoing or already over in most of the countries. Once the immediate emergencies are covered up through the respond stage, the next is to seek a serious effort to review and reorganise the shape of technologybased solutions under the reengineering stage. It covers established strategies, detailed plans and structural reformation of rules and guidelines to reframe the existing setup designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. It is also a time to realign priorities and allocate resources for each and every technology sector along with balancing between cost and benefits. The third stage is the reinforce stage which includes sufficient time to strengthen and build technological capabilities on the basis of previous outcomes. At this stage, to meet the COVID-19 challenges, the convergence of technology could be performed with efficient process workflows and automation. The last stage would be rebound, a time to drive rapid growth and sustainable development to gain the momentum in all sectors either conservatively, moderately or aggressively to steer it in the right direction for the future. Following are some of the technology-enabled future research directions for fighting COVID-19 pandemic: 5.3.1 Embracing touchless technology. This pandemic has set a benchmark to lead this world towards touchless technological advancements via AI, IoT, data analytics, machine learning, etc. The advancements are focused on analysing the commands set by the human gesture, motion, voice, expressions, retina, holographic imaging, etc., where each activity can be mapped with a certain set of actions. For instance, smart voice-enabled assistants led by iPhone (Siri), Amazon (Alexa), Google assistant, interpret the speech commands to perform the desired action like make a call, search, set an alarm, take a picture, etc., facial feature recognition for person identification via smart cameras and sensor devices, holographic projections can aid in the touchless stimulation of the same set of commands as by the touch-enabled technologies.",
