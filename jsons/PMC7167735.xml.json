            "text": "The family Leguminosae contains about 500 genera and is among the largest families of flowering plants. The plants of Leguminosae are widely distributed, and in terms of number of specie, it is one of the largest terrestrial family of plants after Orchidaceae and Asteraceae (Stevens, 2015). The genera that belong to this family are important medicinally and contain a variety of biologically important molecules; some of the examples are Psoralea, Indigofera Pongamia, and Alhegi. The plants of Psoralea had been given high value due to the medicinal properties they showed. The word Psoralea originates from the Greek psoraleos, which stands for \u201caffected with the itch or with leprosy\u201d (Chopra, Dhingra, & Dhar, 2013). The species of Psoralea are native to America, commonly found in the South and the Alleghenies in the west (Maisch, 1889). In India, it is found as a wild weed in cold weather of the Himalayas. It is found in Bombay, Bengal, Utter Pradesh, Rajasthan, in valley of Karnataka, Bihar, and Deccan (Sah, Agarwal, & Garg, 2006; Sharma, Yelne, Dennis, Joshi, & Billore, 2000). The plants are widely distributed in the Himalayan regions of China and Pakistan and there are reports that they have been seen in Southern Africa (Deshaprabhu, 1966; Srivastava, Singh Rawat, & Mehrotra, 2004; Xiong et al., 2009).",

            "text": "One of such important plant species is Psoralea corylifolia L. (Leguminosae). P. corylifolia grows annually and is an erect herb. The range of height to which this plant grows is between 30 and 180 cm, it does not grow in shade and requires warm location. The soil requirement for this plant is clay, sand, and loam types. The plant can survive in acid, basic, and neutral environment. The best sowing season for this plant is March to April. Seeds get mature in November. The plant may grow up to 5\u20137 years if proper care is given (Vijnan, 1986). The fruit of Psoralea is perennial. The fruit cannot survive in freezing weather. The fruit normally has no odor, but when chewed, it produces pungency. The taste of the fruit is bitter, acrid, and unpleasant. The size of the flowers are small and shaped like red clover (Krishnamurthi, 1969). The arrangement of the leaves is racemes. The simple leaves are broad, elliptic, having margins with dents. There are total of about five major nerves that originated from the leaf base. The leaves are pubescent with white hairs on upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The color of the flowers when it blooms during rain are purple with blue tints. They are more crowded in the axils. The peduncles are long headed and a single raceme may carry 10\u201330 flowers. The color of the pods is black chocolate like. The pods are small sized (3.5\u20134.5 \u00d7 2.0\u20133.0 mm). The shape of pods is ovoid to oblong, may be flat. Psoralea contains a single seed. The shape of the seed is elongated with smooth surface. The seed is without hairs, compressed, and are pitted closely. The color of the seed is dark brown. The seeds have no starch, have oily texture, and have no endosperm (Krishnamurthi, 1969). The crop gets fully mature in 7\u20138 months. The seeds take time to mature, and therefore collection can be rendered 4\u20135 times from December to March (Sharma et al., 2000; Figure 1).",

            "text": "\nP. corylifolia is an important part of therapeutics in Ayurveda and in Chinese medicines. The plant is cardio active and showed antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. It is used as a pigmentor. The plant showed cytotoxicity against tumors and worms (Baquar, 1989; Rizvi, Saeed, & Zubairy, 2007; Sharma, 2004). In Chinese medicines, the Psoralea plant is considered warm by nature, and therefore shows many healing actions on kidney and spleen meridians (Daiquan, 2000\u20132006). The seeds of P. corylifolia are used in indigenous medicine systems for healing of various ailments. The seeds are diuretic, aphrodisiac, laxative, anti\u2010helminthic, and are used in febrile conditions. In Ayurveda, the seeds are used in the form of paste and as an ointment for external as well as internal use for treatment of different conditions such as alopecia, inflammation, leukoderma, leprosy, psoriasis, and eczema (Huang, 1998; Judd, Campbell, Kellogg, Stevens, & Donoghue, 1999; SJc, 2015). In India, the powder of seeds is mixed with haratalabhasma (yellow arsenic) and converted to paste with the urine of cow. This paste is used to treat leukoderma lesions. In another formulation, the mixture of powdered seeds with buttermilk have been used externally for treating ringworm and scabies. The seed oil is taken orally with betel nut leaf for treatment of leprosy. Another skin condition, dermatosis, has been treated with adjuvants therapy of bakuchi (P. corylifolia) with other local plants such as Amalaki and Khadira. Similarly, the oils of bakuchi and Karanja are mixed with Vaseline to treat chronic skin diseases (Khare, 2008). The seeds of the plant are also considered useful in bilious disorder, snakebite, and in scorpion sting. The seeds are also used in the production of perfumes (Deshaprabhu, 1966; Maisch, 1889; Sharma et al., 2000). The root of P. corylifolia has shown its effectiveness in dental caries. The fruits are aphrodisiac and have laxative effect, and the leaves are antidiarrheal (Baquar, 1989; SJc, 2015). The plant is also valuable in treating alopecia areata (Dua, Kumar, Pandey, & Kumar, 2013b). In combination with Haritka and Gokshura, this plant is used for urinary frequency, and with Ashwagandha and Bala, it is used for treatment of reproductive diseases and cough. In chronic diarrhea and for treating cold symptoms, this plant is used in combination with Nutmeg and Haritaki (Anderson & Voorhees, 1980). The seeds of Bakuchi in powder form mixed with the decoction of Bibhitaka (Terminalia bellirica bark) and Kaakodumbara (Ficushispida) was effective to treat vitiligo. The infection of ringworm is treated with a combination of Tila (sesame seeds) and Bakuchi (Gupta, Dhar, & Atal, 1978). A combination of bakuchi with Haratalabhasma provides relief against leukoderma when applied externally (Khatune et al., 2002).",

When the fixed oils are removed, what is left after the seed cake are used as feed or manure due to the presence of nitrogen (6.7%) and the minerals (7.8%). Volatile oils obtained from fruits have an irritant effect on the skin and mucous membranes and stimulate the voluntary muscles in high concentrations (Chaudhuri, 2015; Gidwani et al., 2010; Huang, 1998). P. corylifolia in the form of extracts have been used in various herbal formulations when combined with other herbs and used in handling psoriasis and many other skin disorders (Kubo, Dohi, Odani, Tanaka, & Iwamura, 1989). This plant is also reported to be used in cardiac problems, asthma, and urinary discharge (KR, 1975). It also has anti\u2010leishmaniasis activity (Ali, Akhtar, Sultana, Baboota, & Ahuja, 2008). It is used to control watery stool, urinary frequency, and reproductive imbalances (Pole, 2006). In China, it is specially used against vitiligo disease (Anderson & Voorhees, 1980; Khare, 2004).",

In another experiment, HPLC protocol was applied to identify some isoflavonoids such as daidzein, genistein, and biochanin A (Sehrawat, Sangwan, & Yadav, 2014). Further work on the fruit extracted with hexane showed the presence of a phenolic monoterpene known as Bakuchiol (Cui, Taniguchi, Kuroda, & Hatano, 2015). Dried P. corylifolia fruit powder extracted with methanol and analyzed on HPLC reverse column showed the presence of isoflavonoids known as genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A (Hsu, Wu, Chen, Yang, & Wang, 2001). Raun and colleagues have isolated seven compounds from the fruit of P. corylifolia and established the structure of compounds after the spectroscopic analysis. The components identified were corylinin (new compound), psoralen, neobavaisoflavone, sophoracoumestan A, uracil, and daidzin (Ruan et al., 2007). In 2015, two more new flavonoids, bakuisoflavone, and bakuflavanone were isolated from the fruit of P. corlylifolia with antimicrobial activities (Lee, Kim, Baik, Ryu, & Lee, 2015). In one study, six new flavonoid compounds and a meroterpenoid were isolated and identified by spectroscopic methods from P. corylifolia fruits and displayed medium activity against Staph. mutans (Won et al., 2015).",

A bioactivity guided isolation study on P. corylifolia showed that methanol extract and subsequent isolated compounds, including monoterpenes, isoflavones, and coumestan have estrogenic activities, and bakuchiol being the most effective ER agonist. The compound Psoralidin isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of P. corylifolia seeds proved as novel ER modulator with 92.3% of (estradiol) E2\u2010induced ERE\u2010luciferase activity (Lim, Ha, Ahn, & Kim, 2011).",

It was observed that activation of the classical ER\u2010signaling pathway by psoralidin is mediated via induction of ER conformation by psoralidin and direct binding of the psoralidin\u2013ER complex of the EREs present in the promoter region of estrogen\u2010responsive genes. Lastly, molecular docking of psoralidin to the ligand\u2010binding pocket of the ER\u03b1 exposed that psoralidin is able to mimic the binding interactions of E2, and therefore, in the cellular environment it could act as an ER agonist (Liu et al., 2014).",

Another evidence of anticancer activity came from the compound Bakuchiol that suppressed the testosterone induced cell proliferation and gene expression in LNCaP cells. This study was designed to explore the bakuchiol action in the androgen\u2010dependent PCa cell line (LNCaP). MTT assay and real\u2010time PCR method were employed. The IC50 of bakuchiol to androgen receptor was 8.87 \u00d7 104, which was similar to the standard flutamide (10.00 \u00d7 104; MIAO et al., 2013). These experiments showed that bakuchiol is a useful agent for drug development for androgen dependent PCa. The same compound, bakuchiol, has also showed a strong anticancer action against human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and showed much better results than its analogue resveratrol. IC50 of bakuchiol at 72 hr was 9.58 \u00b1 1.12 \u03bcmol/L, much lower than that of resveratrol (33.02 \u00b1 2.35 \u03bcmol/L). Bakuchiol triggered the process of apoptosis to a higher level, compared with resveratrol.

While in higher doses, bakuchiol caused the inhibition of growth of breast cancer cell, with a maximum anti\u2010proliferative action. Bakuchiol also induced ER\u03b2 expression and suppressed the ER\u03b1 expression in MCF\u20107 cells. It also caused the arrest of S phase arrest in MCF\u20107 and MDA\u2010MB 231 cells.
