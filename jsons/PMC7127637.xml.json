            "text": "The worldwide airline network (WAN) has played a critical role in contracting human societies into a global village through the rapid transport of people, commodities and information over long distances. Every year, on average 700 million passengers and $6.4 trillion goods are carried by air (Guimer\u00e0 et al., 2005, Tyler, 2013). Its tremendous impacts on the global socio-economy have drawn increasing attention from a variety of research fields, such as regional studies, international trade, and transportation management (Derudder and Witlox, 2008, Mahutga et al., 2010, O'Kelly and Miller, 1994). Recent reports have also shown that the WAN is both directly and indirectly responsible for inter- and intra-continental spread of diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dengue fever, and novel H1N1 influenza (CIESIN, 2014, Khan et al., 2009, Lemey et al., 2014, Mangili and Gendreau, 2005, Tatem et al., 2012), as well as the spread of invasive species (Liebhold et al., 2006, Tatem, 2009). As the WAN continues to expand at an exceptional rate, knowledge about its characteristics and evolution is crucial for global economic development and disease control (Bogoch et al., 2015, Derudder et al., 2008, Millard-Ball and Schipper, 2011, O'Connor, 2003), among other factors.",

            "text": "As research interest in the WAN continues to grow, the availability and completeness of air passenger flow data have become key obstacles. To date, the available data sources can be summarized into three categories. The first category refers to commercial providers of worldwide aviation data, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Official Airline Guide (OAG). Both the OAG and IATA have complete passenger origin and destination records for sale, but the price can be amounted to tens of thousands in US dollars, along with rigorous restrictions for users. The researchers may need to spend a fortune to obtain these data and be prohibited from sharing them with others. As an alternative, the second category of data sources follow the recent movement on open data, which is a new idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. There are a few number of open access data sources concerning the global airline network, but all of them have limitations. The Skyscanner for Business (http://business.skyscanner.net/portal/en-GB) offers online API services to access live pricing and airfare search history, but these data are not directly related to the real passenger origins and destinations. The Openflights organization (Openflight.org) offers free downloadable datasets, but they are only limited to airports and routes with no details for passenger flows. The Sky Explore (http://geog-cura-osgeo.asc.ohio-state.edu/t100/web/main.html) presents a WebGIS interface to map real passenger flows from multiple data sources, but its data coverage is confined in the North America and Europe.",

These existing models, however, are limited to predicting annual aggregates of air passenger volumes, and thus represent the WAN as a static structure during a year. In reality, the WAN is dynamic over time and space given that passenger volumes fluctuate by month and flight routes open/close by season (Feuerberg, 2008, Grubesic et al., 2009). The data aggregation in current models hides the network dynamics, which could otherwise provide insights into the spatio-temporal patterns of various global processes, such as disease spread and labor migration. For example, many diseases, such as the flu and dengue fever, have seasonal dissemination patterns, and the annually summarized air traffic data is not appropriate to predict the global disease dispersion. The temporary labor migration also varies to fit fluctuating job markets such as the tourism and agriculture, and hence monthly air traffic would offer a more reliable estimation than the annual aggregates. To date, few studies have been devoted to modeling temporally-resolved air passenger flows over the WAN. As a result, little analysis has been conducted on the fine-scale spatio-temporal variation of the WAN within a year.",

A gravity model, thus, can be utilized to estimate the air passenger volume between any pair of nodes. Our model views the air passenger flow as an outcome of spatial interactions between a pair of origin and destination airports, which can be formulated into a multiplicative function of node and link characteristics, as shown in Eq.

The airport and route datasets were utilized to compute geographic distances between airports, construct network graphs for each month in 2010, and derive network measurements, such as the in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness centrality.",

Since the passenger numbers on a flight can never exceed the seat capacity, it is more appropriate to set the seat capacity as an offset, rather than a regular covariate, with its coefficient constrained to 1. Further, a dispersion parameter was added to account for the potential over-dispersion problem. This problem arises from the Poisson distribution, which confines its variance to be equal to its mean. For count data, the observed variance could in fact be greater than the mean, known as over-dispersion. As formulated in Eq. (3), adding a dispersion parameter \u03d5 allows the variance to vary from the mean value \u03bc, which may produce a better fit.

For example, the inverse distance between two airports was statistically significant in all monthly models (Fig. 3a), and shows a negative association with air passengers, reflecting the distance-decay effect of \u2018gravity\u2019. The interaction term between the incoming capacities of origin and destination airports was positively associated with the air passenger volumes throughout the 12 months (Fig. 3b), implying more passengers if there were larger airports at both ends of the journey. The temperature at the destination is another driver of air travel (Fig. 3c). During cold months in the northern hemisphere, such as from January to April and from October to December, the temperature was positively related to the number of air passengers, suggesting that people tend to fly to warmer places. However, the temperature had negative or no associations with air travelers during the summer months in the northern hemisphere from May to September. Lastly, the scale parameter, defined as the square root of the dispersion parameter \u03d5 in Eq. (3), was estimated to range from 13 to 26 over the 12 months.

As shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6\n, most changes were concentrated in the northern hemisphere due to the majority of the world's population being distributed there. From stage 1 (January to March) to stage 2 (April to October), significant decreases in travelers were clustered in short-haul flights within East and Southeast Asia (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, a noticeable increase of long-distance travelers was seen within the US and between Europe and other continents (Fig. 5b). A possible reason is that the stage 2 spanned the late spring to fall in northern hemisphere, which had longer daytimes and warmer weather, and thus encouraged human activities (e.g., tourism) as well as long distance travels. To increase profits, many short-haul flight routes were likely closed temporarily so that the air carriers could be redistributed to serve medium or long-haul routes, for example, the seasonal air routes between Philadelphia (USA) and Barcelona (Spain), and between Atlanta (USA) and Athens (Greece). In addition, the declining economic trends of the time of the data used to construct the model were likely another reason for the reduced number of passengers, given its tremendous impact on airline industry. The global economy was contracting in 2010, and therefore it is very possible that some variations were attributable to the economic decline.",

Those routes with reduced passengers were primarily long-haul flights, possibly because the winter weather in the northern hemisphere discouraged the demands for trans-continental travels. Only a few flight routes had an increased passenger volume, and a majority of them were medium haul flights toward tropical regions, for example, Caribbean islands and Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "There were several limitations of this modeling work that may introduce uncertainties in estimation and bias in interpretation. First, the flight datasets used in model building only record passenger information on direct links between airports. Although the model is capable of estimating the flows between airports separated by 2 or more stops, the estimates could be biased to a certain degree. To address this issue, additional datasets with passenger transfer information, such as flight ticket databases, could be further included in the model. Second, a simple 200 km catchment area was set to estimate the population size served by an airport. The realistic travel time/distance to an airport could vary by airport size, local economic size, population density, travel means, etc. More sophistication should be introduced to delineate the catchment area and better reflect the population sizes at the origin and destination airports. Third, the number of air passengers was assumed to be independent with one another between flight routes to satisfy the assumption of linear regression models. This route independence could be problematic, because the passenger numbers could be related when one route is connected to the other. In future research, the Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) data, which records itinerary samples, can be further included in our model to account for multiple-stop travels and dependence between flights. At last, the selection of months as the basic temporal unit for modeling is an ad hoc criterion that may impose new problems. For instance, the air traffic often peaks during long holiday periods and school breaks that may cross months. Such fine-grained peaks might be evened in the monthly model and maps.",

First, Poisson regression models were developed to predict monthly passenger volumes in the WAN, which refine the previous annual scale models.

The proposed modeling approach can be extended to other years too, if data of those years are available.",

Existing studies have devised various tools to understand yearly or quarterly evolution of WAN (Feuerberg, 2008, Grubesic et al., 2009, O'Connor, 2003). These tools help identify global roles of cities, evaluate population's accessibility to air travel, and predict future geographic patterns. It would be interesting to reexamine these topics with the same tools, but a closer lens at the monthly scale. For instance, cities that play important roles in some months, but not the entire year, can be revealed. The effects of seasonal flight routes on the WAN structure can be investigated. The accessibility to air travel can be assessed in a spatial and temporal manner. Such fine-grained analyses on WAN would offer new knowledge for regional planning or dynamic strategy design. For example, those cities that are temporarily important for months in the WAN could be fast growing nodes in the future regional development and are worth attention from urban planners. The monthly assessment of accessibility to air travel may suggest dynamic airfare strategies to mitigate local and regional biases in time and costs. The World Health Organization can also identify possible high-risk routes for the next (few) month(s) according to the monthly WAN structure and disease prevalence, and then optimally focus its control efforts (e.g., airport surveillance) to these routes.",
