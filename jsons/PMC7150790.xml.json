Influenza A and B showed the most dynamic variability, while RSV remained markedly consistent in this population. Influenza is zoonotic, constantly experiencing genetic shift and drift, and spilling over into human populations. However, humans are the reservoir for RSV, and RSV is therefore very well adapted to human populations and may not be as driven by geographic and population-level factors as influenza. For example, temperature and humidity patterns are known to influence the spread of both RSV and influenza [20,21,22]. However, influenza epidemics are also influenced by sociodemographic characteristics of the underlying population [23,24]. It is unclear exactly how much RSV is dependent on similar population features, but previous studies support associations between respiratory viruses and human behaviors that may help explain their seasonality [25]. Previous studies showed that analysis of climate forcing and genetic drift and shift could well-predict influenza epidemic behavior [26]. Our study supports this conclusion, while also suggesting that influenza pandemic years are associated with irregularities in seasonal timing for certain other respiratory viruses. More research is needed to understand if this is due to interference by emerging influenza strains or due to some shared climate or population effect.",
