Some ferrets may be lightly restrained on the examination table. Others will need to be restrained in a firmer manner.\u2022Tractable ferrets can be lightly restrained on an examination or treatment table by placing one hand under the chest and lifting slightly.\u2022Energetic ferrets may be restrained by scruffing (Fig. 175-1\n). Use one hand to grasp the skin over the back of the neck and lift the ferret up, suspending all the limbs. Stroke the abdomen with a downward motion to relax the ferret. The ferret's back may be supported with the other hand, or the ferret may then be reclined along the forearm of the arm used to scruff the ferret. Most ferrets will become very relaxed, although some young ferrets and some females may resist.\u2022Firm restraint is often required when administering vaccinations or when performing treatment procedures. Control the head by scruffing, or by cupping the back of the ferret's neck and placing the thumb and fingers along the caudal border of the mandibles. Place the other hand over the pelvis to restrain the hindquarters on the table top with the hind legs underneath the body; do not pull the legs back.\u2022Aggressive ferrets, such as nursing females, kits, or ferrets raised with little human contact, are uncommon. Restrain these ferrets by the scruff of the neck, using the techniques previously described. Avoid using leather gloves, which are awkward. Use sedation if necessary.\n",

Alternatively ferrets may be given inhalant agents without premedication via chamber or face-mask induction.\u2022Isoflurane is the inhalant anesthetic most commonly used in small mammal practice. Sevoflurane is used in some practices as well. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic isoflurane and sevoflurane are very similar; sevoflurane smells better and is better tolerated during face-mask induction.\u2022Isoflurane does not provide analgesia. Administer an analgesic pre- or intra-anesthesia if a painful procedure is to be performed. Analgesic agents commonly used in ferrets include Buprenorphene (0.01-0.03 mg/kg q8-12h SC, IM, IV), Butorphanol (0.05-0.5 mg/kg q8-12h SC, IM), Carprofen (1 mg/kg q12-24 PO), and Flunixin meglumine (0.5-2.0 mg/kg q12-24h IM, IV).\u2022Intubate ferrets to facilitate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). A 2.5 to 3.5 mm endotracheal tube usually is suitable.\u2022The same planes of anesthetic depth reported for dogs and cats occur in the ferret.\u2022Follow basic principles of anesthesia for small animals, (see Chapter 2) and provide supplemental heat during surgery; administer IV fluids (isotonic electrolyte solutions supplemented with 2.5-5% dextrose) during long procedures and for insulinoma surgery.\n",
