The overall mortality rate of COVID-19 is variable, ranging from as low as 0.7% in Germany to as high as 10.8% in Italy [2]; nevertheless, older adults and people with underlying comorbidities invariably have a poor prognosis [3]. Accordingly, diabetes mellitus (DM) has emerged as a distinct comorbidity that is associated with severe disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and increased mortality in COVID-19 [[4], [5], [6]]. In the largest series reported from China comprising of 72,314 cases, patients with DM had higher mortality (7.3% in DM vs. 2.3% overall) [7]. DM was present in 20.3% of the patients with COVID-19 who died in Italy [8].",

            "text": "Multiple pathophysiological explanations can be put forward supporting the association between DM and COVID-19 severity. Innate immune system, the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2, is compromised in patients with uncontrolled DM [12]. Moreover, DM is a pro-inflammatory state characterized by inappropriate and exaggerated cytokine response; this has been depicted in COVID-19 patients wherein serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in patients with DM than those without DM [13]. This suggests that people with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory cytokine storm eventually leading to ARDS, shock and rapid deterioration of COVID-19. In addition, the aforementioned study also showed that COVID-19 patients with DM had higher D-dimer levels than those without DM [13]; perhaps signifying over-activation of the hemostatic system. Amid an already underlying pro-thrombotic hypercoagulable state predisposed by the mere presence of DM [14], over-activation of the coagulation cascade in COVID-19 can lead to fatal thromboembolic complications and eventual mortality [15].",

Under normal physiological conditions, ACE2 degrades angiotensin-II and to a little extent angiotensin-I to smaller peptides, namely angiotensin [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] and angiotensin [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]], respectively. The pulmonary ACE2/Ang [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] system plays a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant role and ACE2 is known to be protective against lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infection [16]. Accordingly, low ACE2 expression in DM might explain the increased incidence of severe lung injury and ARDS with COVID-19 [4,17].",

ACEi/ARBs are commonly used in people with DM as anti-hypertensive and renoprotective drugs. The use of ACEi/ARBs is associated with increased expression of ACE2 as an adaptive response to counteract the elevated levels of angiotensin-II [4,18]. Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for entry into the host pneumocytes, thus, ACE2 upregulation would facilitate entry and subsequent proliferation of the coronavirus. However, once the virus uses the enzyme to gain entry into the host tissue, ACE2 get downregulated and it is unable protect against lung injury [4].",

Yang et al. had reported that patients with SARS (caused by SARS-CoV, the \u2018cousin\u2019 of SARS-CoV-2) who had never received glucocorticoids had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose levels as compared to patients with non-SARS pneumonia [20]. This was explained on the basis of SARS-CoV mediated damage of the pancreatic \u03b2-cells as ACE2 is also expressed on the pancreatic islets [21]. Infact, immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization have identified SARS-CoV in the pancreas of patients who died of SARS [22].

Moreover, obesity, commonly associated with T2DM is likely to further aggravate the cytokine response, thereby further worsening insulin resistance [23]. In addition, SARS-CoV increases serum levels of fetuin A, an \u03b12-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein that has been linked to impaired insulin sensitivity [24]; whether SARS-CoV-2 can lead to elevation of fetuin A needs exploration. Lastly, COVID-19 is often associated with hypokalemia; this has been attributed to downregulation of pulmonary ACE2, reduced angiotension-II degradation and subsequent increased aldosterone secretion [4]. Hypokalemia, in turn, can worsen glucose control in patients with T1DM and T2DM [25].",

Stringent social distancing and hand hygiene should be the norm. Good glycemic control should be targeted as it would help boost the innate immune system [4,35]. However, widespread nationwide lockdowns would curtail their routine in-clinic visits, limit their physical activity, alter their food habits and adversely affect their psychological health; all these would ultimately lead to poor glycemic control [36]. Infact, a recent study from China had shown that elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus had higher fasting blood glucose during the COVID-19 pandemic [37]. Teleconsultations with registered medical practitioners would help people with DM circumvent a lot of problems imposed by lockdowns [38]. Although certain anti-diabetic drugs like pioglitazone and liraglutide have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in animal models, the current evidence does not support any change in the ongoing medications [39]. Similarly, international organizations recommend patients on ACEi/ARBs to carry on with their medications. Although used rarely, hydroxychloroquine can be good anti-diabetic medication in the present scenario as the drug has also been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in-vitro as well as reduce the viral load in COVID-19 patients. The drug has also been approved for prophylaxis against COVID-19 in many countries [40]. Considering the low-cost, widespread availability, modest HbA1c reduction, once-daily dosing and relatively good tolerability, hydroxychloroquine may be a good add-on drug during this outbreak for patients with poor glucose control, provided contraindications like diabetic retinopathy and cardiomyopathy has been ruled out [39]. Similarly, tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, is being tried in patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab is known to improve insulin resistance and reduce HbA1c in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus [42]. In addition, camostat mesilate has been used as anti-viral drug against COVID-19; the drug was earlier pursued as an anti-diabetic drug as it was shown to lower blood glucose levels in insulin-treated patients with diabetes mellitus [44]. In addition, remdesivir, an adenosine analogue that inhibits viral replication, does not affect blood glucose and lipids when compared to placebo [45]. Convalescent plasma has been used in the management of COVID-19 and seems to be a safe alternative [46]. The effect of drugs being tried in the management of COVID-19 on glucose and lipid profiles has been summarized in Table 1\n.",

Diabetes mellitus contributes to increased disease severity in COVID-19 via compromised innate immunity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response and low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in people with diabetes mellitus have widely been implicated in contributing to disease severity in COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 leads to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus perhaps by direct virus-mediated \u03b2-cell damage, augmentation of insulin resistance through cytokines and fetuin A and hypokalemia. In addition, drugs being used in the management of COVID-19 like corticosteroids and lopinavir/ritonavir can also contribute to dysglycemia.",
