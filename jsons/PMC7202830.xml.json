This is a reasonable time for the response to a vaccine, but it is much too long for the response to infection. In the germinal centre,7 B cells modify their antibodies through the introduction of somatic mutations in the antigen-binding site of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes.

First, in the early phases of infection, natural antibodies8 play a most important role. Natural antibodies, mostly of IgM isotype and generated independently of previous antigen encounters, have a broad reactivity and a variable affinity. They contain the infection during the 2 weeks necessary for production of high-affinity antibodies and MBCs9 that will clear the virus and prevent reinfection. High-affinity antibodies are expressed by switched MBCs. In humans, natural antibodies are produced by innate or IgM MBCs, a population of MBCs that is generated independently of the germinal centres and is most abundant in children.10, 5 From this population of B cells, sorted from the blood of young adults never exposed to avian influenza virus, we have cloned human antibodies able to neutralise antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, and H9 influenza subtypes.11 Thus, innate or IgM MBCs can bind many different unknown microorganisms.",

Following infection, two types of MBC, CD27dull and CD27bright MBCs,12 cooperate. The two populations are related but have distinct molecular signatures and functions. CD27bright MBCs express highly mutated VH genes shaped by antigen. On stimulation, CD27bright MBCs rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts and secrete antigen-specific antibodies, mostly of switched isotype. By contrast, CD27dull MBCs are less mutated, generate few plasmablasts and secrete IgM antibodies. Innate or IgM MBCs are CD27dull. When CD27bright MBCs are used to produce plasmablasts and increase the amounts of antibody, CD27dull MBCs proliferate and rapidly reconstitute MBC numbers.12 Thus, the interrelationship between CD27dull and CD27bright MBCs might explain the resilience and rapidity of the adult immune response.",

In infants and children, most MBCs are CD27dull and thus highly adaptable to new antigens. In contrast, in the elderly, most MBCs are CD27bright.

This response is not observed in adults with severe disease (who have a depletion of the B-cell compartment). Further studies are ongoing to show the difference in the specificities of the antibodies of children and adults. In addition to antibody production, B cells also have the function to secrete cytokines. IL-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine is produced by neonatal B cells, activated B cells,13 and IgA plasmablasts. Thus, the child immune response might have the double function of exerting protection and reducing immune-mediated tissue damage, in particular, in the lung.",
