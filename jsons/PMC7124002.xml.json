In particular, modeling large biological polymers \u2014 proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids \u2014 is a truly multidisciplinary enterprise. Biologists describe the cellular picture; chemists fill in the atomic and molecular details; physicists extend these views to the electronic level and the underlying forces; mathematicians analyze and formulate appropriate numerical models and algorithms; and computer scientists and engineers provide the crucial implementational support for running large computer programs on high-speed and extended-communication platforms.The many names for the field (and related disciplines) underscore its cross-disciplinary nature: computational biology, computational chemistry, in silico biology, computational structural biology, computational biophysics, theoretical biophysics, theoretical chemistry, and the list goes on.",

Though our models represent a highly-simplified version of the complex cellular environment, systematic studies based on tractable quantitative tools can help discern patterns and add insights that are otherwise difficult to observe. The key in modeling is to develop and apply models that are appropriate for the questions being examined with them. Thus, the model\u2019s regime of applicability must be clearly defined and its predictability power demonstrated.

Modeling provides a way to systematically explore structural/dynamical/thermodynamic patterns, test and develop hypotheses, interpret and extend experimental data, and help better understand and extend basic laws that govern molecular structure, flexibility, and function.

            "text": "In the early 1960s, pioneering work on development of systematic force fields \u2014 based on spectroscopic information, heats of formation, structures of small compounds sharing the basic chemical groups, other experimental data, and quantum-mechanical information \u2014 began independently in the laboratories of the late Shneior Lifsonat the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) [747], Harold Scheragaat Cornell University (Ithaca, New York), and Norman Allingerat Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan) and then the University of Georgia (Athens). These researchers and their talented coworkers (notably Warshel and Levitt) began to develop force field parameters for families of chemical compounds by testing calculation results against experimental observations regarding structure and energetics. In 1969, following the pioneering Cartesian coordinate treatment described by Lifson and Warshel a year earlier [766], Levitt and Lifson reported the first energy calculation on entire protein molecules (myoglobin and lysozyme), in which molecular potentials and experimental constraints defined the target energy function minimized in Cartesian coordinates by the steepest descent method to refine low-resolution experimental coordinates [748]. Such formulations in Cartesian coordinates paved the way for all subsequent energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations of biomolecules. In fact, Warshel\u2019s recognition in the mid 1960s that programming molecular force fields in Cartesian coordinates rather than internal coordinates [766] led to efficient evaluation of the functions along with analytic first and second derivatives and to program segments in many current macromolecular modeling programs [747].",

In particular, spectroscopists criticized the notion of transferability of the force constants, though at the same time they were quite curious about the predictions that molecular mechanics could make. In time, it indeed became evident that force constants are not generally transferable; still, the molecular mechanics approach was sound since nonbonded interactions are included, terms that spectroscopists omitted.",

Most programs and force fields today, for both small and large molecules, are based on the works of the pioneers cited above (Allinger, Lifson, and Scheraga) and their coworkers. The water force fields developed in the late 1970s and early 1980sby Berendsen and coworkers (e.g., [1079]) and by Jorgensen and coworkers [617] (SPC and TIP3P/TIP4P, respectively) laid the groundwork for biomolecular simulations in solution.

This is because computer power alone is not likely to solve the folding problem in general. For example, the 10 \u03bcs simulation of Fip35 [424] did not provide the anticipated folded conformation nor the folding trajectory from the extended state, as expected from experimental measurements; this long simulation also raised force field and algorithmic stability questions, which were explored later [426].

For example, truncating long-range electrostatic interactions makes possible the study of large systems over short times [597], or small systems over long times [338]. Using implicit solvent and cutoffs for electrostatic interactions also allows the simulation of relatively small systems over long times [1428]. And simplified, coarse-grained models with effective potentials also allow simulations over longer time frames, with the correct physical behavior. (These topics are discussed in later chapters). In fact, with the increased awareness of the sampling problem in dynamic simulation (see 10.1007/978-1-4419-6351-2_13Molecular Dynamics: Basicschapter.13.916), long single simulations are often replaced by several trajectories, leading to overall better sampling statistics, and coarse graining is being applied to biological systems and problems of greater complexity [655].",

The compact Fugu rubripes genome is only one-ninth the size of the human genome but contains approximately the same number of genes: shorter introns and less repetitive DNA account for this difference. The whole-genome shotgun approach (see Box 1.3) was used to sequence Fugu (see the 23 August 2002 issue of Science, volume 297). Through comparative genomics, analyses of this ancient vertebrate genome and of many others help understand the extent of protein evolution (through common and divergent genes) and help interpret many human genes.",

However, genome association studies have generally shown limited value in predicting human diseases because genetic variations only explain a small part of the genetic/disease link. In other words, the genetic link to disease remains largely unclear and it is possible that rare variants account for most of the genetic basis for disease. Indeed, dissenting voices have suggested that our efforts to pinpoint the genetics of common diseases may not work. Still, successful examples of using a patient\u2019s DNA to help tailor medication has shown some promise, as in the case of Tamoxifen for breast cancer, Erbitux for colon cancer, or Iressa for lung cancer \u2014 all of which work only for patients with a particular genetic mutation. Nonetheless, these findings are complicated by the fact that genetic tests are not sufficiently accurate at present, as indicated by the breast cancer drug Herceptin, which is only effective on certain subtypes of the disease. See Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4419-6351-2_15 Similarity and Diversity in Chemical Designchapter.15.1151 for an expanded discussion of pharmacogenomics, including Herceptin.",
