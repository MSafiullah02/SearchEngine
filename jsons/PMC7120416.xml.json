A prospective case-control study conducted in Taiwan aiming to investigate possible links between common viral infections and KD found that cases of KD were more likely to have overall positive rates of viral PCR in throat and nasopharyngeal swabs for adenoviruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses [8]. KD is characterized by an endothelial cell injury, which could be due to abnormal cytokine production and to generation of cytotoxic antibodies against the endothelial cells [9]. All data suggest that this activation of the immune system occurs after infection only in genetically predisposed individuals. The most consistently associated genetic variants are nonsynonymous polymorphisms in a high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G (FCGR2A) and variants in the region of the T-cell regulator ITPKC, a kinase of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate), a second messenger molecule involved in the Ca2+/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) pathway, or in caspase-3 (CASP-3), as confirmed in some genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [10].",
