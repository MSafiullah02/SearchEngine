We have observed that influenza\u2010like illness defined by clinical features, which may be caused by both influenza and other viral infections such as those highlighted above are associated with an increased risk of MI. This association appears to be absent in influenza cases defined by serology. There are a number of possible explanations that might account for this. The clinical features of influenza may be secondary to other viral infections so using clinical features may include other non\u2010influenza infections. Participants in whom influenza was diagnosed by serology may represent a different biological cohort than those patients in whom influenza diagnosis is based on clinical features. This may be because participants identified from serology may be asymptomatic, have atypical or milder symptoms because of infection with less virulent genotypes of influenza virus while participants who are diagnosed with influenza on clinical grounds might have more severe influenza infections which could manifest cardiovascular complications. Inclusion of asymptomatic cases may lead to a cohort with fewer cardiovascular events and reduced likelihood of detecting differences when compared with control group. Second, the timing of the serology test is important to determine if it is associated with cardiovascular event. Serology tests are able to measure the antibodies that develop in response to influenza virus but this response develops within 2\u20133 weeks of infection 35, 36, 37. Once developed, antibodies remain at detectable levels for months 38, thus making the test reliable in confirming influenza infection exposure. Consequently, if serological testing took place in the acute phase infection, the test result may represent a false negative. The quality of the serology test for influenza may also present a problem as high quality and standardised methods should be used to minimise variability in results. It is notable that two of the studies of serology took place in 1977 and 1981 and it is unclear, if the laboratory tests are as reliable and robust as those having been conducted more recently. Serological tests may detect cross\u2010reactive antibodies generated by previous exposure to antigenically similar viruses leading to false positive results. The current gold standard for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection is reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction or viral culture although this methodology was not used in studies included in the current analysis.",

However, serologically defined influenza infection will also include asymptomatic cases that may not be clinically relevant and may be missed unless a study defines a cohort and tests all participants regardless of whether they are symptomatic. Influenza\u2010like illness on the other hand may include other viral illnesses as previously described. This population will represent the clinically relevant cohort and may be larger than the true influenza cohort. However, it may be more heterogeneous in clinical features than the influenza cohort because it may include infections with other viruses. The ideal study should actually consider both in parallel. This can be conducted by taking a defined population and testing all participants for influenza and then prospectively collect data on whether participants develop symptoms of influenza. This study will allow understanding of the specificity of the influenza\u2010like illness that is unclear.",

It has been suggested that influenza and influenza\u2010like illnesses may increase the risk of acute MI by mechanisms such as: antigenic cross\u2010reactivity; increased pro\u2010inflammatory and pro\u2010thrombotic cytokines; loss of anti\u2010inflammatory properties of HDL particles; increased trafficking of macrophages into the arterial wall; pronounced expression of inflammatory cytokines by infected monocytes; reduced clotting times and induction of pro\u2010coagulant activity by infected endothelial cells and increased expression of tissue factor 18. Coagulopathy and inflammation are thought to be key factors 39. Inflammation is also an important part of the atherosclerotic process and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 are increased in the context of studies of influenza in mice 40. Repeated influenza infection may injure the vascular endothelial cells and initiate the inflammatory response that is required to accelerate and enhance atherosclerosis development 18. Furthermore, viral infections can trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines, which could destabilise existing vulnerable plaques leading to MI 41.",

In addition, bias may arise from the variation in the way influenza was diagnosed which ranged from symptoms associated with respiratory infection to diagnoses based on serology tests. The most reliable diagnostic methodology is laboratory serological tests, as other chest infections or atypical respiratory infections may have clinical features consistent with influenza infection. However, even when serological tests were used to ascertain influenza infection, it is possible that patients who did not have serology positive influenza did not have flu and this may account for the dissimilarity between the two large cohorts evaluating public health records and the remaining studies. Furthermore, adjustments for potential confounders are important to reduce risk of bias. Only a limited number of studies in the current review adjusted for baseline variables and there is always the risk of unmeasured confounders.",

Data from large databases may fail to capture asymptomatic cases of influenza, which do not present the health services or patients who self medicate and do not seek medical attention. Another limitation relates to the inclusion of older studies that used different diagnostic criteria for MI. The diagnostic criteria for MI in older studies were based mainly on clinical criteria, echocardiography, electrocardiographical changes and possible enzyme rises of creatinine kinase that are not as sensitive as high sensitivity troponin assays used in contemporary practice to detect myonecrosis, which may have resulted in under\u2010reporting of incident MI in older studies",
