Women were known to have lower tolerance of pain(Ruau, Liu, Clark, Angst, & Butte, 2012), but this might not be applicable to infectious diseases. In fact, that gender differences only occurred among those living in small metropolitan or non-metro areas suggested this might be more likely due to system level factors rather than individual behaviors. Furthermore, the reasons for a lower incidence of COVID-19 among small metropolitan areas were complicated. The dispersed residence in small towns and rural areas may deter the virus transmission, leading to a relatively lower incidence of COVID-19. On the other hand, there might not be enough detection kits available in these areas, resulting in an artificially lower incidence compared with large metropolitan areas. In addition, health care facilities in the US were mostly concentrated in large cities. Many small town or rural hospitals were not equipped to manage infectious patients. Patients with mild symptoms might be triaged to self-care at home, without being diagnosed and lab confirmed. For elderly people, this was not ideal, as the respiratory symptoms may exacerbate suddenly. Many of these severe cases were likely transferred to hospitals in larger cities, often enduring all kinds of troubles during the process.",

First of all, not all patient's information was publicly released due to privacy concerns. There were no explicit dates of symptom onset, clinic or ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the data. There was no other information such as race and ethnicity, income and education level in the file, hindering our ability to full examine the roots of disparities (Hill et al., 2015) . However, this was not unique to Florida. Many other states released aggregated data only. To some extent, we had more than enough data that were useful to paint a broad picture, but no good data to help understand the drivers of epidemic process and examine health disparities behind the case counts. Secondly, although elderly patients might be more likely to have symptoms if infected by the virus, we would nevertheless miss many asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who would not seek care or not be detected. The detection kits, especially at the early stage of epidemic and in small metropolitan and rural areas, were not readily available to health providers. We did not know whether the proportion of asymptomatic patients differed between large metropolitan areas and small metropolitan or nometro areas. Thus, we might underestimate the case incidences and overestimate the rates of ED visits and hospitalizations among those living in small metropolitan or non-metro areas. The true health disparities might be worse than our observed disparities. Thirdly, the COVID-19 epidemic was still evolving. Although our previous research indicated that the end of epidemic was near in the US (Yu, 2020), there would still be a lot of new cases to come every day, and the patterns of hospitalizations and deaths by different age, sex and regions would likely be more evident at the end of epidemic. Finally, given that much was still unknown regarding the treatments and consequences of COVID-19, elderly people might be impacted more profoundly by the epidemic and health disparities due to the diseases might be long lasting.",
