Each participant coughed twice and the furthest distance that a visible food dye droplet travelled on the ground was measured.

They showed that when HFNC flow rates were increased from 10-60 L\u00c1min -1 , non-cough exhaled air distances (in the forward direction) increased from 6.5 to 17.2 cm, and up to 62 cm (in the lateral direction). It is uncertain if such short distances are accurate in patients who are coughing. Leung et al. 4 found no evidence of increased surrounding surface contamination when using HFNC in patients with gram negative bacterial pneumonia. Nevertheless, extrapolating findings from patients with bacterial pneumonia to those with viral pneumonia may not be rational. In our study, four of the five volunteers' cough droplets travelled further than the WHO-recommended 2 m safe exclusion zone. Overall, the distance of droplet dispersion from coughing increased by an average of 0.42 m with HFNC. Using the other studies 3,4 as a guide, the safest way to use HFNC during the current COVID-19 outbreak is to embrace the potential of nosocomial airborne transmission and ensure HFNC devices are at least used in single occupancy rooms or negative pressure airborne isolation rooms 5 when possible. Healthcare workers caring for those using HFNC should be wearing full airborne personal protective equipment (i.e., N95 mask or equivalent, gown, gloves, goggles, hair covers, and face shield or hoods).",
