            "text": "In this study, we evaluated the anti-reovirus activity of kuraridin isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens. In particular, we focused on whether this property is attributable to direct inhibition of reovirus attachment and/or inhibition of viral replication with the aid of time-of-addition (pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post-treatment) experiments. No significant antiviral activity of kuraridin was detected in the pre-treatment assay. In the simultaneous assay, the 50% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC 50 ) of kuraridin were 15.3e176.9 mM against human type 1e3 reoviruses (HRV1e3) and Korean porcine reovirus (PRV). Kuraridin completely blocked binding of viral sigma 1 protein to sialic acids at concentrations lower than 82.5 mM in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Moreover, kuraridin inhibited HRV1e3 and PRV viral replication with EC 50 values of 14.0e62.0 mM. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis disclosed strong suppression of reovirus RNA synthesis at the late stage (18 h) of virus replication by kuraridin. The viral yields of kuraridin-treated cells were significantly reduced at 24 h postinfection, compared with DMSO-treated cells. Our results collectively suggest that kuraridin inhibits virus adsorption and replication by inhibiting hemagglutination, viral RNA and protein synthesis and virus shedding, supporting its utility as a viable candidate antiviral drug against reoviruses.",

Reoviruses, originally referred to as \"respiratory enteric orphans\", were first isolated from humans in the United States and Mexico in the 1950s (1) . MRVs are represented by four prototype strains: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), type 3 Dearing (T3D) and type 4 Ndelle (T4N), with the majority of strains assigned to serogroups T1L, T2J or T3D (2) . Reoviruses have been isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of children with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms (1) . However, limited studies have focused on human reovirus-associated neurological disease to date (3) . Pneumonia and other respiratory diseases in both naturally and experimentally infected primates (4) , and isolation of reoviruses from children with meningitis and encephalitis are widely documented (5, 6) .",

However, the number of licensed antiviral drugs for treatment of highly pathogenic RNA virus infections remains limited (10) . These viral diseases are considered difficult to treat with selective antiviral chemotherapy, highlighting the need for further refinement of antiviral drug design and development. Medicinal plants have a variety of chemical constituents, including alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, lignans and coumarins, known to inhibit the replication cycles of various DNA and RNA virus types. Compounds derived from natural sources are therefore of significant interest as possible sources of viral infection control (7e9).",

(S. flavescens) have been historically used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine, owing their anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, antipyretic, antiasthmatic, and antiulcerative effects, and for the treatment of diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and eczema (11) . Additionally, a formulation containing S. flavescens is reported to inhibit angiogenesis in a collagen-induced arthritis rat model (12) . In previous studies, quinolizidine alkaloids, flavonoids, and triterpenoids were isolated from the roots of S. flavescens (13) . Recently, quinolizidine alkaloids and flavonoids have been shown to exhibit a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including anticancer, antiinflammatory, antitumor, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antibacterial, and anti-influenza properties (11,13e21) . However, the potential anti-reovirus activities of extracts and compounds isolated from S. flavescens have not been examined to date. In the current investigation, we evaluated the abilities of the MeOH extract, EtOAc fraction and kuraridin isolated from S. flavescens to inhibit human type 1e3 reoviruses (HRV1e3) and Korean porcine reovirus (PRV). Antiviral assays were employed to determine whether the S. flavescens compounds alter reovirus activity by inhibiting virus attachment and/or replication.",

The sigma 1 protein specifies tissue tropism and is responsible for hemagglutination (HA) activity and binding of SA (29, 30) . The HA activity of reoviruses strongly implies a role of SA in cell binding and infectivity of reoviruses, similar to influenza A virus, rotavirus, various coronaviruses and Sendai virus (31) . In the current study, the HI assay was employed to assess the inhibitory effects of the extracts and kuraridin on viral adsorption to host cells. The MeOH extract and EtOAc fraction completely inhibited HRV1 adsorption to hRBCs as well as HRV2e3 and PRV adsorption to bRBCs at concentrations below 92.5 mg/mL. Kuraridin induced complete inhibition of hemagglutination activity of HRV1 with hRBCs and HRV2e3 and PRV with bRBCs at concentrations below 82.5 mM (Fig. 5) . I21nterestingly, the HI activity of kuraridin was stronger for HRV3 and PRV than HRV1 and HRV2. These differences are linked to sigma 1 protein sequences and possibly attributable to serotypespecific interactions of viral proteins with different cell surface receptors. Five residues (Asn198, Arg202, Leu203, Pro204, and Gly205) in sigma 1 protein are reported to play a role in reovirus and SA interactions (32) . Additionally, SA binding by sigma 1 protein of type 3 reovirus is mediated by an eight-stranded cross b-sheet of only the T(iii) domain (residues 175e234) and hemagglutination by type 1 reovirus mediated by the T(iii) and T(iv) domains (residues 248e314) (33) . Thus, the diversity of sigma 1 protein according to type 1e3 Fig. 8 . Reduction of reovirus production by the MeOH extract, EtOAc fraction, and kuraridin.

Although the mechanisms by which kuraridin inhibits reovirus replication are currently unclear, the compound is known to affect viral factors, such as RNA and protein. Our experiments showed that viral RNA levels are significantly lowered by kuraridin. Interestingly, reoviral RNA synthesis was significantly inhibited by kuraridin at the late stage (18 h) of the viral replication cycle for HRV3 and PRV (Fig. 6A) . The reovirus replication cycle comprises two distinct transcription phases (primary and secondary), which occur at early and late stages, respectively. For primary transcription, viral RNA rapidly replicates at 6e8 h post-infection within progeny viral particles. Secondary transcription is mediated by particles assembled from the newly synthesized RNA and protein molecules, and mature virions are produced at >12 h post-infection (4). Our findings indicate that kuraridin inhibits viral protein synthesis (sigma 1) to produce the same changes in viral RNA levels and reduces virus shedding (Figs. 7 and 8). Based on these results, we suggest that the kuraridin suppresses reovirus replication via inhibition of viral RNA, protein synthesis and virus release.",

RNA extraction was performed at 6 and 18 h post-infection with HRV1e3 and PRV, and the levels of intracellular viral RNA measured via real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR data disclosed reduced reovirus RNA levels in kuraridin-treated cells, compared with non-treated cells (0.5% DMSO) HRV1e3 and PRV (Fig. 6A). Viral RNA inhibition in kuraridintreated cells was the greatest at late-stage (18 h) infection, indicating that kuraridin (30 mM) inhibits viral RNA synthesis most strongly at the late stage (18 h) than the early stage (6 h) of infection. Furthermore, we observed dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA in PRV-infected TF-104 cells treated with 5e50 mM kuraridin for 24 h post-infection(Fig. 6B). The immunofluorescence assay conducted to investigate viral protein (sigma 1) inhibition by kuraridin (30 mM) in PRV-infected TF-104 cells demonstrated green fluorescence for virus-infected(Fig. 7B)but not mock-infected cells(Fig. 7A).
