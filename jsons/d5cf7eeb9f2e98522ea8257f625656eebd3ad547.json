The objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations issued in CPGs for therapy, diagnosis, and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). CPGs released by international scientific societies after year 2000, using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, were analyzed. Number and strength of recommendations and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) were extracted and indexed in the aforementioned sections. High-quality evidence was based on randomized control trials (RCT) without important limitations and exceptionally on rigorous observational studies. Eighty recommendations were assessed, with 7 (8.7%), 24 (30.0%), 29 (36.3%), and 20 (25.0%) being supported by high, moderate, low, and very lowquality evidence, respectively. Highest evidence degree was reported for 26 prevention recommendations, with 7 (26.9%) supported by high-quality evidence and no recommendation based on very low-quality evidence. In contrast, among 9 recommendations for diagnosis and 45 for therapy, none was supported by high-quality evidence, in spite of being recommended as strong in 33.3% and 46.7%, respectively. Among HAP/VAP diagnosis recommendations, the majority of evidence was rated as low or very low-quality (55.6% and 22.2%, respectively) whereas among HAP/VAP therapy recommendations, 4/5 were rated as low and very low-quality (40% each). In conclusion, among HAP/VAP international guidelines, most recommendations, particularly in therapy, remain supported by observational studies, case reports, and expert opinion. Well-designed RCTs are urgently needed.",

In Europe, the first guideline on CAP was released in 1998 by the European Respiratory Society (ERS); in 2001, an ERS task force released an expert review on VAP, followed by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on HAP/VAP in 2009 [3] [4] [5] . These early CPGs were based primarily on experts' opinion, derived from clinical experience. Since the first editions, several versions of the guidelines were released, and throughout the years the infectious diseases societies joined the respiratory, thoracic, and intensive care medicine associations, to release shared documents.",

In 2004, the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was released [6] . This method was introduced with the aim of standardizing patient management, guiding everyday clinic decision, and improving the quality of care. Recommendations are based on literature analysis and experts' opinion and, depending on the quality of the reviewed literature, recommendations with different strength are made. With the GRADE method, the quality of literature can be downgraded, based on the presence of important limitations, inconsistencies or publications bias, or upgraded if a large magnitude effect is recognized [6, 7] .",

The flow chart of the recommendation selection, following the four PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) phases [21] , is reported in Fig. 2 . Eighty recommendations were finally enclosed and analyzed; strength was graded for 54 of the recommendations. The majority of recommendations were issued on HAP/VAP treatment (n = 45), followed by prevention (n = 26) and diagnosis (n = 9). Overall, 7 recommendations (8.7%) were supported by highquality evidence, 24 (30.0%) by moderate quality, 29 (36.3%) by low, and 20 (25.0%) by very low-quality evidence ( Table 2 ). Among 24 strong recommendations (44.4%), only 9 (37.5%) were supported by moderate quality of evidence. Low and very low quality of evidence supported comparable proportion of strong evidence (33.3% and 29.2%, respectively) ( Table 3) .",

In the infectious diseases field, with rare diseases and heterogeneous clinical presentations, conducting RCTs might be difficult, lowering the overall quality of evidence. A study conducted on IDSA guidelines from 1994 to 2010 found that only 14% of the recommendations were linked to high-quality evidence (level of evidence A in the original article, based on RCTs), while the majority of the recommendations relied on expert opinion and case studies [17] . In HAP and VAP, despite being common hospital-acquired infections and a major concern for morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit [18, 19, 22] , the involvement of critically ill patients might represent a limitation for conducting interventional studies and to generalize conclusions from observational cohorts in non-critically Feasibility of interventional studies has also to be considered, together with ethical implications, appropriateness of the study design, practical limitations, and costs. The majority of recommendations were issued on HAP/VAP treatment. In HAP and VAP, often caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, the delay in appropriate antimicrobial treatment represents a poor prognostic factor and is mainly driven by the pathogen extended resistance pattern itself [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Appropriate antibiotic treatment is hence pivotal and challenging. The majority of treatment recommendations regarded antibiotic choice and duration (data not shown), addressing key bedside clinical decisions. Nonetheless, for HAP/VAP treatment, none of the recommendations issued was based on high-quality evidence. The majority of evidence was rated low and very low, and only a third of strong recommendations was supported by moderate quality of evidence. The lack of a gold standard for HAP/VAP diagnosis and the geographical and in-hospital variability of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility are partly responsible for the lack of high-quality evidence supporting these practices (Table 4 ). Interventional studies on general hygiene measures, effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance, and collateral care, such as bed positioning, might be performed with less difficulties, explaining the greater quantity of high-quality evidence recorded in HAP/VAP prevention. These data point out the need of collaboration to realize large RCTs, increasing the quality of evidence.",

Our study results reinforce the importance of literature knowledge to accurately translate CPGs and their recommendations in clinical practice and represent a call of wide collaboration to realize well-designed research in treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of HAP and VAP. Importantly, some clinical questions cannot be answered with high-quality evidence, because the clinical questions themselves are too complex and the antibiotic resistance profiles are profoundly different between sites and keep evolving. Furthermore, among the earliest HAP/VAP guidelines in the pre-GRADE era, with the possible exception of single antibiotic coverage for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and shock absence, few recommendations based on lower grade of evidence were revised by subsequent studies.

Since then, new evidence might have been published on the addressed topic. Most CPGs are updated in periods longer than 5 years, with difficult incorporation of emerging evidence until next iteration. Published literature should be periodically reassessed, to update CPGs references and recommendations, creating a dynamic document. The creation of an adaptation framework for integration of new evidence in CPGs [30] would avoid outdated recommendations and will improve implementation in clinical practice. Second, literature supporting each recommendation was not revised and quality of evidence was not reassessed. Evidence and recommendation rating analyses Data shown as number (%) * Recommendations on prevention were excluded were based on the classification reported in original papers, with no changes in the rating assigned to the literature by CPGs writing committees. Lastly, CPGs on HAP/VAP issued by other scientific societies without explicitly reported recommendations or quality of evidence assessment were excluded from the analysis. Despite these limitations, there are important strengths. The study provides a detailed analysis of quality of evidence used to write HAP/VAP international guidelines, an important evaluation in evidence-based medicine. The results point out the difficulty of performing RCTs and providing high-quality evidence in critically ill patients.
