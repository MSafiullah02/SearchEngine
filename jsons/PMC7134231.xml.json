SMA has also the potential to use advanced techniques to analyse patterns in social media data to enable informed and insightful decision-making for Citizen Relationship Management (CzRM) [2, 3]. CzRM is the growing effort of governments around the world to strive to respond rapidly to their citizens by fostering a closer relationship with them, thereby creating more efficient service delivery and e-participation. e-Participation often empowers citizens through social media to act in bottom-up decision-making processes. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to the rise of e-participation, whereby governments adopt digital tools to promote citizen involvement in what is referred to as \u201cCzRM\u201d [4]. Recently, [5] argued that the potential of Big Data for digital tools is often not met since it presents a data set that is so large or complex that it is difficult to process and manage this data using traditional data processing and management applications. The effective and efficient storage and retrieval of vast amounts of structured as well as unstructured data, referred to as Big Data, remains a challenge [6].",

Some of these advantages are improved service delivery, improved decision-making, transparency, an improved organisation image and more inclusive policy processes. However, [11, 12] report that governments lack valid and reliable measures for determining and analysing the effects of social media. Without these measures they remain unable to align their social media initiatives with organisational strategies and ultimately create business value. Several studies [13\u201315] indicate that the use of social media and ICTs in a government context increases collaboration amongst stakeholders, enabling feedback and promoting citizen e-participation.",

They also do not consider the data value chain or the challenges for addressing service delivery and citizen e-participation with social media. There is also a lack of related research in Africa. This gap was addressed by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) in order to design a conceptual model. The structure of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of the research question and method adopted in the research. Section 3 reports on review findings: the data lifecycle and SMA challenges. Section 4 reports on discussions and implications for research in Africa. Section 5 concludes the paper and provides an agenda for future possible research.",

People share a lot of personal information in these networks without any concern for what the organisation behind these networks will do with their data, resulting in a huge threat to our personal privacy [40, 41, 43]. It is not an easy task to address this problem. One suggestion is for new redefined legislation to increase the protection of data privacy.

This revolution has often been termed the \u201cFacebook Revolution\u201d or \u201cTwitter Revolution\u201d. There are many ambiguities as to the extent to which social media affected these movements. An investigation conducted by [62] aimed to shed some light on the broad characteristics of tweets about African cultural heritage. The findings identified possible implications and strategies for tourism stakeholders in their use of social media in general and Twitter in particular. It was found that tourism stakeholders could use text analysis of publicly available tweet messages to improve tourism. Social media interactions on the financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya was found to offer a platform for marketing and sales of products, development of new product brands and access to real-time customer feedback thereby supporting an enhanced understanding of the needs of their customers [63].",

The aim of the paper was to identify the challenges of social media Big Data and SMA and to propose a model that can provide guidance to practitioners and researchers. If these challenges are addressed, the success of SMA projects can be improved, particularly in government. This classification has three categories, based on the data life cycle, namely: (1) Data; (2) Process; and (3) Management. The challenges of social media Big Data for supporting the context of citizens\u2019 e-participation, service delivery and decision making were identified (Table 1). An important contribution of the paper is the extension of the data challenge category to the full data value chain, so as to reach the potential Big Value of Big Data (see Fig. 2). The paper also made a contribution to research conducted in Africa.",

By addressing the challenges of Big Data and SMA identified in this study (Table 1 and Fig. 2), governments can improve decision making, e-participation and ultimately service delivery to citizens. There is a dire need for additional research on the challenges and future research directions regarding analysing social media Big Data. The novelty of this paper lies in the design and use of a conceptual model for social media Big Data to inform the e-participation of citizens and decision making of management in government. Improved decision-making can assist in a smart city strategy for governments. The study limitation is that it has no empirical evaluation in a practical context as it is based on secondary data from existing literature studies. Future work will include the evaluation of the proposed model.",
