The disease is presently a serious concern for the swine industry worldwide and causes a significant loss to swine producers (Neumann et al., 2005; Dietze et al., 2011). Weak initial innate immune response and inefficiency of acquired immunity greatly contribute to persistent or repeated infections in susceptible pigs and herds, and to a some extent, these weakened immune responses may predispose for secondary bacterial co-infections (Mateu and Diaz, 2008; Jung et al., 2009). Thus, apart from application of other methods to heighten the overall health status of the herd, use of feed ingredients or feed additives including spray-dried animal plasma, direct-fed microbials, plant extracts, and mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) has been suggested (Turner et al., 2001; Pettigrew, 2006).",

A total of 32 weaned pigs [3-wk-old; 6.3 \u00b1 0.6 kg BW; Pig Improvement Company (PIC) line C-22 female \u00d7 PIC line 337 male], free of PRRSV, were transported from a University research farm to the experimental site, and upon arrival they were placed in disease-containment chambers. Each pig received a daily intramuscular injection of Lincomycin (11 mg/kg of BW; Pharmacia and Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) for 3 consecutive days after arrival to prevent infections. Pigs were blocked on the basis of initial BW within sex into 4 BW blocks, resulting in a total of 8 blocks. They were randomly assigned from within the same BW block to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement [2 types of diet: control (0%) and ACT supplementation (0.04%); and with and without PRRSV] in a randomized complete block design.

In our experiment, anorexia occurred as early as 2 to 3 DPI and infected pigs showed signs of sluggishness. Escobar et al. (2007) demonstrated that feeding time and activity of PRRSV-infected pigs started to decrease at 1 DPI and remained decreased until the end of the experiment (14 DPI). Toepfer-Berg et al. (2004) showed that PRRSV decreased ADFI beginning 3 DPI and throughout a 12-d experimental period. We found that the ADFI and ADG of infected pigs were greatly reduced during 0 to 28 DPI. However, from 28 to 42 DPI, the ADFI of infected pigs recovered to near normal (91% of the control), whereas the ADG of infected pigs was still substantially affected, with a reduction of 24%. These data suggest that retarded growth of pigs due to PRRSV infection results from not only the reduced feed intake, but also increased nutrient needs for the immune defense processes of the host. It was further observed that feeding ACT ameliorated the adverse effect of PRRSV on feed use. Infected pigs fed ACT had a better G:F during 28 to 42 DPI than those fed the control. In the present experiment, ACT also enhanced PRRSV-specific antibodies in infected pigs at 35 DPI. These combined improvements may be an indicator of efficient redirection of nutrient use for both growth and host defense processes during the chronic phase of infection. Improved feed efficiency in PRRSV-infected pigs consuming MOS was also documented previously (Che et al., 2011). It should also be noted that the ACT-reduced ADFI contributed to the improved G:F in pigs consuming ACT. Our result was consistent with the previous meta-analysis of MOS (Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY), which showed that the improvements in G:F of pigs in most studies were resulted from the MOS-induced reductions of ADFI (Miguel et al., 2004). Together, these data suggest that ACT fed to pigs may alter metabolic changes leading to the reduced ADFI without compromising ADG.",

Other researchers also observed a similar fever response pattern (Shibata et al., 2003; Doeschl-Wilson et al., 2009). Activation of the immune system by PRRSV triggers secretions of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 that are most responsible for fever. Mild but prolonged fever is often a typical response to infections of a North American PRRSV strain. Depending on PRRSV strain and challenge dose, body temperature of infected pigs may remain sporadically elevated up to 14 or 28 DPI (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2000; Loving et al., 2008). It is worthy of note that during the experimental period, ACT slightly increased the RT of the pigs from 39.7 to 39.8\u00b0C regardless of PRRSV. This implies that feeding ACT might have induced changes in physiological and metabolic processes, which would contribute to the adjustment of body temperature. The effect of ACT on body temperature may, to a certain extent, be associated with ACT-induced activity of immune cells which perhaps helps the immune system stay alert, but not over-stimulated. Thus, further research on this aspect is required.",

After exposure to PRRSV, specific antibodies may be detectable as early as 5 to 10 DPI (Murtaugh et al., 2002; Diaz et al., 2005). However, antibodies which appear during the early postinfection period are not efficient at neutralizing PRRSV, and therefore do not provide protection against the infection (Murtaugh et al., 2002; Lopez and Osorio, 2004). Serum antibodies that neutralize PRRSV have been reported to arise about 21 to 28 DPI or later time points (Loemba et al., 1996; Meier et al., 2003). In our experiment, the increased anti-PRRSV antibody response induced by ACT at 35 DPI may importantly contribute to the protection against PRRSV infection. The appearance of neutralizing antibodies is slow and lasts for only a few months, but good correlations between the appearance of neutralizing antibodies and clearance or prevention of viremia have been reported (Yoon et al., 1996; Osorio et al., 2002; Lopez and Osorio, 2004). Although no clear effect of ACT on viremia was observed, ACT enhanced the adaptive immune response at the time which neutralizing antibodies are expected to appear in the circulation and consequently may confer a certain degree of protection. During this period, the improved G:F observed in infected pigs consuming ACT is likely to be associated with the increased antibody titer and numerically less ADFI. Therefore, the effect of ACT on total and neutralizing antibody concentrations and viremia should be examined for longer postinfection periods to further explore this potential benefit of ACT.",

The PRRSV-induced IL-1\u03b2 started to rise as early as 3 DPI and remained greater than that of uninfected pigs until 42 DPI. Interleukin-1\u03b2 is one of the innate cytokines produced earliest after pigs are challenged with PRRSV, and its serum concentration is observed elevated up to 42 DPI (Escobar et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2010; Lunney et al., 2010). It was assumed that IL-1\u03b2, together with other cytokines, could have an effect on viral persistence (Lunney et al., 2010). These data imply that IL-1\u03b2 may play an important role during the early as well as subsequent stages of infection. Indeed, IL-1\u03b2 is capable of promoting T-cell proliferation and B-cell maturation and multiplication. Infection with PRRSV elicits a weak production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which diminishes the ability of the host to efficiently mount subsequent immune responses (Murtaugh et al., 2002; Mateu and Diaz, 2008). Hence, ACT-mediated upregulation of IL-1\u03b2 protein in infected pigs may favorably raise the innate immunity against PRRSV.",

            "text": "Infection with PRRSV enhanced production of circulating T helper 1 (Th1)-associated cytokines including IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. Among these cytokines, infected pigs fed ACT had a greater IL-12 concentration than those fed the control. During infection, IL-12 enhances the killing activity of natural killer cells and induces IFN-\u03b3 production in natural killer and T cells (Watford et al., 2003). Also, IL-12 plays a critical role in development of naive T cells to IFN-\u03b3-secreting Th1 cells, which participate in cellular immunity (Holscher, 2004). Although ACT enhanced IL-12 in infected pigs, it did not affect the serum IFN-\u03b3 concentration. This suggests that there are multiple components of the immune system, apart from IL-12, influencing the activation of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells as well as production and release of IFN-\u03b3 into peripheral blood. Indeed, IFN-\u03b3 production is mediated via IL-18 and produced by different types of immune cells involved in not only early innate response but also the subsequent antigen-specific adaptive immunity (Nakanishi et al., 2001; Schroder et al., 2004). Consistent with earlier reports (Wesley et al., 2006; Loving et al., 2008), our results indicated that IFN-\u03b3 was detectable soon after PRRSV infection and its serum concentration was low, but continued to be elevated for a couple of weeks postinfection. In regards to TNF-\u03b1, its serum concentration began to increase at 3 DPI and decreased to normal after 28 DPI. These data indicate the involvement of this cytokine in regulation of inflammation during acute and chronic phase responses. Other researchers also found increased concentrations of serum TNF-\u03b1 as early as 3 to 7 DPI (Liu et al., 2010; Miguel et al., 2010; Che et al., 2011). In general, feeding ACT to infected pigs may fortify the cell-mediated immunity as ACT is associated with the increased concentrations of IL-12 in infected pigs throughout the experimental period.",

            "text": "Release of serum anti-inflammatory mediators, IL-10 and Hp appears to be responsive to PRRSV-induced inflammation. Increased concentrations of IL-10 and Hp occurred later than the innate and Th1-associated cytokines. The IL-10 and Hp concentrations declined toward the end of the experiment, implying that the inflammatory process seems to be repressed. The increase in IL-10 of infected pigs may be dependent on the inflammation intensity caused by PRRSV. Che et al. (2011) found elevated concentrations of IL-10 at 7 DPI. In another study, serum IL-10 increased at 33 DPI, peaked at 38 DPI, and diminished to the pre-infection concentrations (Wang et al., 2011). Interleukin-10 is secreted to suppress inflammation through blocking activation of immune cells and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ouyang et al., 2011). It is also capable of stimulating B cell maturation and antibody production. Consequently, production of IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory molecules is essential to regulate a harmony between protection and immunopathology. Increased IL-10 and PRRSV-specific antibodies, accompanied by decreased IL-12, after acute phase suggest that ACT aids in shifting from Th1 to T helper 2 (Th2) immune responses toward the end of the experiment. In addition, Hp, a type-2 acute phase protein has a strong response to PRRSV and often remains increased for several weeks postinfection before returning to normal (Parra et al., 2006; Gnanandarajah et al., 2008). Cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 induce hepatocyte-produced Hp. The rise of Hp appears to coincide with the increased IL-10. Acute phase proteins including Hp may provide a feedback mechanism by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Petersen et al., 2004). Therefore, ACT-mediated increases of IL-10 and Hp in infected pigs during the chronic phase of PRRSV are likely to be crucial in enhancement of acquired immunity and suppression of inflammatory responses.",

Dietary ACT increases serum concentrations of inflammatory mediators that are important in boosting innate and cell-mediated immunity. Further, diets supplemented with ACT potentially mitigate negative impacts of PRRSV through enhanced PRRSV-specific antibodies. Feeding ACT is also efficacious in improving nutrient utilization in pigs infected with PRRSV. However, it should be noted that although not causing any adverse effects, feeding ACT slightly increases the body temperature of the pigs. To maximize use of ACT in diets, its effects on growth and immune response in pigs subjected to other pathogens require further examination, as commercially-reared pigs are frequently exposed to multiple pathogens including PRRSV.",

The antibody titer is presented as sample to positive control (S/P) ratios and viremic concentration as cycle threshold (Ct) values of all infected pigs. The Ct values presented are inversely related to virus concentrations. The antibody response of pigs to PRRSV was found negative (S/P < 0.4) at 7 d postinoculation and positive at 21 and 35 DPI. Dietary ACT did not affect the antibody titer at 21 DPI (P = 0.139), but increased it at 35 DPI (P = 0.042). Dietary ACT did not affect the viremic concentrations of infected pigs throughout the experimental period. Values were means \u00b1 pooled SEM.
