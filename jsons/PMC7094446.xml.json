These changes contribute to the increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, the reactivation of latent infections and to the decline of protective immune responses to vaccination observed in many adults above 60\u201365 years of age (Jefferson et al., 2005, Goodwin et al., 2006, Kovaiou et al., 2007, Kumar and Burns, 2008). Although existing vaccines can significantly reduce the risk of complications and death from infections in the elderly compared with younger individuals (McElhaney, 2005, Vila-Corcoles, 2007), the development of new vaccines capable of overcoming the defects of ageing is still urgently needed. For both scientific and regulatory requirements, including safety concerns, improved vaccine candidates for older adults first have to be evaluated in appropriate animal models. The relevance of the results obtained with such models is influenced by the selected animal species.",

            "text": "Most often, mice are the species of choice for the development of human vaccines, including those targeted at the elderly (Gerdts et al., 2007). Among the major advantages of aged murine models are the commercial availability of aged mice or the possibility to raise them relatively easily in animal facilities, their well-defined genetic background and health status, their ease of handling and relative cost-effectiveness, the possibility of genetic manipulation and the availability of a wide range of specific immunological tools. Most importantly, senescent mice have been shown to display altered immune responses to vaccination (e.g. against influenza; Mbawuike et al., 1996, Asanuma et al., 2001) that reproduce some features of immune defects in the elderly (Deng et al., 2004, Goodwin et al., 2006). The utility of aged mouse models for evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of novel vaccines for older individuals has been reported for several infectious diseases and pathologies, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or cancer (Mbawuike et al., 1996, Sambhara et al., 1998, Zhang et al., 2002, Vogel et al., 2007, Posnett et al., 2009). Furthermore, the capacity of some vaccine candidates to efficiently restore the deficient immunity in senescent mice was subsequently confirmed in ageing humans (Higgins et al., 1996, De Donato et al., 1999, Podda, 2001, Holland et al., 2008).",

With regard to vaccination practices, the injected vaccine volume in the mouse is generally not proportional to that in man (e.g. for the intramuscular route a volume of 50 \u03bcl is injected into the mouse quadriceps muscle versus 500 \u03bcl into the human deltoid muscle). Furthermore, the injection sites, and therefore the lymph nodes targeted by immunization, often differ between mice and man. This may lead to possible differences in immune response. Strict intranasal immunization is difficult to carry out in mice, where there is a potential risk of inhalation (intrapulmonary route) or ingestion (oral route) of vaccine antigens. As for the intradermal route, the skin structure and composition differs greatly between mice and man.",

Moreover, there is a limited knowledge of the immune system of such models, in particular of geriatric large animals, and few specific immunological tools are available. Data have shown that the immune system of ruminants, especially of sheep and cattle, as well as that of pigs, contains many more T cells expressing the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptor (TCR) than that of man (Hein and Mackay, 1991, Takamatsu et al., 2006).

The selection of the most appropriate model will be the prerequisite to transfer successfully the results of preclinical research into clinical applications. The available animal models are not perfect and do not fully replicate the complexity of the aged human situation: the pre-immune status of humans (due to multiple previous infectious episodes and/or vaccinations) may differ from that of animals, while confounding factors (e.g. health status, use of medication, personal habits) are difficult to reproduce at the preclinical level. However, the use of animals lacking this complexity may allow a better demonstration of the improved immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine. The most relevant animal model is not necessarily the least expensive or the most convenient one, and there is a need to acquire more data on the immune system of large animal species, in particular during ageing.",
