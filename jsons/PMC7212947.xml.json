Two patients (15.4%) required non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support, of which one required escalation to invasive mechanical ventilation. A total of six patients (46.2%) required invasive ventilatory support, for a median duration of invasive mechanical ventilatory support of 9 (IQR 7, 14) days (Table 3). These patients had moderate to severe hypoxemia diagnostic of ARDS, with a median PaO2/FiO2 ratio on day one of 178 which worsened to a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 105 by day three. Worsening hypoxemia and lung disease also was reflected in the escalation of ventilatory support by day 3 (Table 5\n; available at www.jpeds.com). Lung protective strategies for mechanical ventilation in ARDS were insufficient in these patients by day 3 with a median PEEP requirement of 10 cm water, resulting in a median peak pressure of 35 cm water. One patient was successfully extubated after 6 days of ventilatory support, and one patient died after withdrawal of care. The remaining 4 patients remained on mechanical ventilatory support on day 14 of hospitalization.",

            "text": "We describe 46 hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed in the first weeks of the New York City pandemic to add to the limited data on pediatric SARS-COV-2 infection. As expected, patients admitted to the PICU were noted to have more severe symptoms and markers of inflammatory response. However, as this cohort is from a unique, dense, urban setting, we note findings not previously observed in other hospitalized cohorts of children with COVID-19. Our patients had a higher rate of PICU admission per hospitalization (28.2%), which may be a reflection of a variety of social determinants that influence health outcomes. In previous studies (5,6,7), the ICU admission rate in children ranged from 1.7% to 16%. (3,5,7) In adults, the PICU admission rates range from 5% to 32%. (1,2, 12,13,14,15) Among PICU admissions, 84.6% were \u226511 years of age. The presence of comorbidities, including obesity, has been described to be one of the risk factors for critical illness with COVID-19 in children (5); however, in our small sample, age and obesity were not associated with increased likelihood of PICU admission. The overall high prevalence of obesity could partially explain our higher PICU admission rate. However, obesity may also be a marker for other risk factors associated with an increased risk of critical illness, such as poverty. (16) For example, Bronx County has the highest poverty rate of the New York City boroughs and is the least healthy county in New York state. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between social factors, such as poverty, and the increased risk of prolonged hospital stay as well as PICU admission for many different conditions.

The lack of a known sick contact reported in our study may have implications for how healthcare providers identify and screen for potential cases.",
