The combined operation requires total cardiopulmonary bypass and if successful carries a risk of accelerated coronary atheroma and problems resulting from cardiac denervation. However, it is relatively simple technically, maintains coronary\u2013tracheobronchial arterial anastomoses that help the tracheal anastomosis to heal, and is particularly suitable when both heart and lungs are damaged, as in pulmonary hypertension. In cystic fibrosis, it is necessary to replace both lungs to avoid the risk of spillover infection. Double-lung transplantation is a complex procedure but was initially used in emphysema because it was feared that with single-lung transplantation the native diseased lung would be preferentially ventilated. This proved not to be the case and single-lung transplantation is now widely used for both severe emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. It is the commonest procedure, the simplest to perform, is associated with the fewest postoperative complications, requires the least amount of donor tissue and enables the greatest number of recipients to benefit from a single donor.6\n",

Loss of these structures promotes postoperative haemorrhage, breakdown of the tracheal or bronchial anastomosis, a reduction in the cough reflex and pulmonary oedema. A further aspect of lung transplantation is that some lymphatic tissue is inevitably included in the allograft, entailing a risk of graft-versus-host disease. This is greatest when the whole mediastinum is transferred, as in combined heart and lung transplantation, but in practice it is a rare complication.",

            "text": "Lung transplantation is an operation of last resort. There are insufficient donors and patients are unlikely to be considered unless other measures have failed and their short-term prognosis is otherwise poor. The presence of uncontrolled systemic disease precludes consideration and good renal and hepatic function is essential, particularly in view of immunosuppressant drug toxicity. This is particularly important in \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis, both of which may affect the liver directly. Any infection that cannot be eliminated, either before or by the operation, is likely to disseminate postoperatively because of the immunosuppression and therefore militates against successful transplantation. An aspergilloma is a contraindication to any form of lung transplantation as its attempted removal inevitably leads to seeding of the pleural cavity and mediastinum. Previous thoracic surgery may make it difficult to operate and the possibility of a future lung transplant should therefore be borne in mind when considering the best treatment for conditions such as pneumothorax. Left ventricular function should be normal or near normal, although treatable coronary artery disease is not an absolute contraindication. Ventilator support prior to transplantation is a significant risk factor.7 Pulmonary neoplasia is generally regarded as a contraindication because of its early dissemination but bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (now termed adenocarcinoma-in-situ) is often limited to the lungs and double-lung transplantation has been employed to treat this form of lung cancer.8 Contraindications of less importance include age over 65 years and body mass index over 30.",

However mild asthma and smoking do not adversely affect outcome.15 Physiotherapy, bronchial toilet, prophylactic antibiotics as required and monitoring of blood gases and pulmonary wedge pressure are all important in managing a potential donor.

It may also predict the presence of systemic disease and the likelihood of the original disease recurring in the allograft, or detect malignant disease, which apart from bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (now adenocarcinoma-in-situ) is an absolute contraindication to transplantation. Explanted lungs should also be examined, and without delay, in case they show unsuspected diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or malignancy that may be active elsewhere in the recipient.21 A major discrepancy between the pretransplant diagnosis and that apparent on examining the explant has been reported in up to 10% of cases.22 Similarly, if only one donor lung is used, the other should be examined as this may identify unsuspected infection or other disease that is likely also to be present in the graft.

It is not surprising therefore that poor healing at the airway anastomosis has been a serious complication, although bronchial artery revascularisation, performed at a few centres at the time of transplantation, have rendered it less common.32, 33 The anastomosis is also subject to infection until the surface epithelium heals and mucociliary clearance recovers.29 Denervation contributes to the risk of infection by eliminating the cough reflex and promoting aspiration.34 Dehiscence of the airway anastomosis is a devastating early complication, but one that is fortunately now rare. More common is the development of exuberant granulation tissue. This may seriously narrow the airway and require endoscopic removal or cryotherapy.35 Late airway complications include stenosis and bronchomalacia (Figure 11.3, Figure 11.4\n), requiring the insertion of stents.36\n",

The changes range from sparse airway cuffing by small lymphoid cells (grade B1R) to diffuse infiltration of the lamina propria and epithelium by medium and large lymphoid cells and epithelial apoptosis (grade B2R) (Fig. 11.11\n).

However, it is known from renal and cardiac transplantation that a less acute form of antibody-mediated rejection, may occur. The criteria for diagnosing this include the presence of de novo donor-specific antibodies, clinical allograft dysfunction, histological features of antibody-mediated rejection and the deposition of complement protein C4d, a stable biproduct of complement C4d activation, on capillary endothelium.104,104a The role of antibody-mediated rejection in lung allograft rejection is far from clear but there are reports of lung transplant patients with many of the features of antibody-mediated rejection being treated successfully with plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin.105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111 While it has been suggested that capillaritis may represent antibody-mediated rejection,109, 112, 113 there is currently no consensus on what histological features define the condition in the lung.114 Furthermore C4d deposition may be seen in lungs with primary graft failure and infection,115, 116 limiting its use as a marker of rejection remains to be elucidated. Recent work has revealed complex interactions between components of the complement system, platelets and endothelial cells as well as evidence suggesting an influence of complement on T and B lymphocyte function.104a, 114 Endothelial activation appears to play a central role in the development of antibody-mediated rejection and further work may provide more specific and sensitive markers of this serious complication of lung transplantation humoral rejection.",

Synchronous and metachronous lesions should all be investigated as variations in clonality and morphology occur both within an individual lesion and between simultaneous or subsequent lesions. Difficulties encountered in diagnosis, especially on core biopsies, stem from the small size of the sample, crush artefact and extensive necrosis caused by angioinvasion.

They predominantly involve B lymphocytes whereas T lymphocytes predominate in the infiltrates that characterise rejection.158 High-grade lymphomas often show angioinvasion and extensive necrosis, thereby resembling lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Early lesions may be rich in mature plasma cells or show changes suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. Polymorphous infiltrates often include plasmacytoid cells (Fig. 11.21\n). Monomorphous infiltrates may consist of transformed blasts, centroblast-like, centrocyte-like cells or immunoblasts showing a high proliferation index (Fig. 11.22\n). Single-cell necrosis is common. Histiocytes and T lymphocytes often cuff the lesion and infiltrate the bronchiolar epithelium while the uninvolved lung may show patchy organising pneumonia. Immunoglobulin clonality is variable. Early lesions tend to be polyclonal. Monomorphous lesions are usually monoclonal while polymorphous lesions may be either polyclonal or monoclonal.167, 174\n",
