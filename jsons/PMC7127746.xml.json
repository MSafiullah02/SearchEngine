Factors related to differences in bacterial pathogenicity might explain this paradox. Most of the older studies of exacerbation did not pay attention to differences in strains of bacteria. In a longitudinal study of patients with COPD, acquisition of new strains of H influenzae, M catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with a significantly increased risk of an exacerbation [28]. One might speculate that the older strains were kept in check by neutralizing antibodies and the newer strain is not subject to such limitation for a period.",

Antibiotics seem less beneficial in mild and moderate exacerbations and when sputum purulence is absent. Prior studies have shown that the presence of purulent sputum during an exacerbation, as reported by the patient, correlated with a higher chance of recovering pathogenic bacteria from sputum [17], [31]. In the study by Anthonisen and coworkers [18], the benefits of antibiotic therapy in acute exacerbation were mostly in the type 1, the group with all three symptoms (increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and purulence). This emphasizes that acute exacerbation of COPD, a syndrome defined by symptoms, has subsets that are more likely caused by bacterial infection than other causes.",

Rhinovirus [33], influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus [19], [33], and human metapneumovirus [34] have been associated with acute exacerbations in COPD. In general, 20% to 40% of acute exacerbation episodes are probably caused by viral respiratory infections [19], [21]. PCR techniques detect viruses in a higher proportion of respiratory secretions than culture or serology. A study of patients with acute exacerbations, using PCR, viral culture of nasal secretions, and serology for respiratory viruses, detected evidence of viral infection in 39.2% of acute exacerbation episodes. Rhinovirus accounted for 58.2% [33]. In another study, the same group of authors reported detecting, by PCR, rhinovirus in induced sputum in 10 (23.2%) of 43 exacerbation episodes [35]. In four of these instances, they could not find rhinovirus in nasal secretions. Another study of patients hospitalized with severe exacerbations found evidence of viral respiratory infection in 56% [36]. Human metapneumovirus has been detected, using PCR, in respiratory secretions of patients with acute exacerbation [34], [37]. These reports establish association, however, not causation. Respiratory viruses have been detected in 16% of patients with stable COPD [33]. Detection of virus by PCR need not mean infection in all cases, and further studies exploring a causal link between viruses and acute exacerbations are needed [38].",

In Linden, Utah, the number of hospital admissions for exacerbations of bronchitis fell when the local steel mill closed, only to go back to prior levels when the mill opened again. The number of atmospheric particles less than 10 \u03bcM paralleled this trend [46]. Atmospheric black smoke and sulfur dioxide have been associated with increase in emergency room visits for acute exacerbation of COPD [20]. Atmospheric pollutants and tobacco smoke cause loss of ciliated cells, decreased mucociliary clearance, mucosal gland hypertrophy, and increased mucus production [47]. Mucus contains glycoproteins with carbohydrate side chains to which bacteria attach [48].",

Clearance of bacteria by the ciliary mechanism is also affected. Recurrent infections lead to further damage to the bronchi, setting up a vicious cycle of suppuration and tissue damage [68]. Recent investigations have focused on defects in host defense against bacteria. Patients with bronchiectasis, in comparison with normal persons, have more of a Th2 immune response to nontypeable H influenzae infection [69]. It is not yet clear if this represents increased susceptibility and inability to clear bacteria in a certain group of patients who are more prone to develop bronchiectasis in response to infections, or a secondary effect of chronic infection.",

What changes in the baseline microbial situation to cause an exacerbation is unclear. It has been proposed that going beyond a certain threshold in the lower airways bacterial load causes the increase in inflammation and an exacerbation [25]. Recent studies in COPD, however, point to acquisition of new strains as a cause. The acquisition and clearance of different strains of M catarrhalis in bronchiectasis has been shown to be a dynamic process [77], with intermittent acquisition and then clearing of new strains. In COPD, acquisition of a new strain of pathogenic bacteria has been associated with a significantly increased risk of an exacerbation [28]. A similar mechanism is very possible in bronchiectasis, but this remains to be established.",

This could be the cause of the disease progression, or more likely the effect. At least one report [80] notes that the rate of decline in lung function was no worse in patients infected with P aeruginosa. This suggests that as the bronchiectasis becomes more severe, with increasing bronchial wall damage, P aeruginosa gains a foothold and serves as a marker for severe disease. S aureus is an uncommon isolate in bronchiectasis that is not caused by CF. One report found that in patients with bronchiectasis who had persistent S aureus isolation in sputum, there was a high incidence of abnormal sweat chloride test. The authors advise that persistent S aureus isolation in bronchiectasis should prompt testing for CF [81].",

The severity of these symptoms varies among patients. These symptoms are worsened by common childhood viral respiratory infections [113]. Infants with mild disease are often not diagnosed until older. As the child becomes older, cough becomes persistent, and if the child is able to expectorate, increasing sputum volume and purulence is noted. Shortness of breath leads to decreased quality of life and deficiencies in growth may be apparent. Once bronchiectasis sets in, hemoptysis, which can be mild to severe, can occur. Cough, wheezing, and purulent sputum become a daily occurrence. Bronchial cysts develop, and occasionally rupture to cause pneumothorax. Exacerbations of the baseline symptoms often necessitate hospitalization [85], [89]. Eventually, respiratory failure is the cause of death in 80% of these patients.",

As mentioned previously, Rosenfeld and coworkers [115] found that 33% of patients have P aeruginosa in BAL by age 3 years. Serologic studies show that infection probably occurs even earlier. Antibodies to P aeruginosa can be shown in blood 6 to 12 months before the bacteria can be recovered by sputum or oropharyngeal cultures [121]. The database of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation shows that about 80% of young adults with CF have chronic P aeruginosa infection (see Fig. 2). Others have found an even higher incidence. Using BAL cultures, 47.5% had P aeruginosa by age 3 years; however, when combined with serology, 97.5% had evidence of P aeruginosa infection [121]. Female gender, homozygous \u0394F508 CFTR mutation, and S aureus isolation from sputum have been identified as risk factors for early acquisition of P aeruginosa\n[122]. There are less severe phenotypes of CF where the burden of P aeruginosa infection is less common. In a series of patients with adult CF, the mean age was 41.8 years and P aeruginosa airway infection was present in only 48% [114].",

Biofilm formation is associated with the production of rhamnolipids, which facilitate dispersal of bacteria within airways [125]. In biofilm mode of growth, P aeruginosa down-regulates virulence factors and tissue invasion [124]. Transcription of the flagellin protein is down-regulated [126]. This is advantageous to the bacterium because flagellin acts as a ligand for bacterial recognition proteins [127].

It frequently coexists with P aeruginosa, but occurs later in the disease [136]. B cepacia can be transmitted in an epidemic fashion between CF patients at CF clinics and outside-clinic social interaction [135]. So far, the prevalence of B cepacia infection remains under 20% in the CF population (see Fig. 1).

The incidence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is increased in CF. Estimates vary because of geographic variation and differences in definitions of diagnosis. Two large United States databases estimate prevalence at around 2% in CF [145], [146], whereas a large European registry reported 7.8% [147]. Patients with CF and atopy have higher prevalence [145]. Prevalence is higher in late adolescence.",

In an autopsy study, patients with CF who had repeatedly positive antemortem cultures for NTMB were more likely to have granulomatous lung disease on autopsy [149].
