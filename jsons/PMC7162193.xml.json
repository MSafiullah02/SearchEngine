            "text": "Viruses, even the largest ones, are minute compared with host cells and cannot encode all the proteins required for their replication because of limitations in their coding capacity. For this reason, viruses rely on the utilization of host cell proteins and cellular structures to facilitate their own replicative processes. Most DNA viruses have evolved the ability to replicate in the host nucleus (with the exception of poxviruses) and to exploit nuclear compartments. On the other hand, many RNA viruses are thought to replicate only in the cytoplasm. However, it has become increasingly apparent that many RNA as well as DNA viruses use nuclear compartments or components for their replication. The nucleus provides the machinery for viral DNA and RNA polymerization, processing and stabilization, and it also is stocked with essential factors for viral egress and maturation. At the same time, the nucleus is the most important organelle, which contains the cell's genetic material and several subnuclear structures that ensure normal cell function. Therefore, the usurpation of the nucleus by viruses constitutes an enormous stress for the cell that may lead to a profound disturbance of physiological functions.",

For many years the classical view of these components focused ontheir crucial role for the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits, but proteomic analysis of human nucleoli showed the presence of about 4500 nucleolar proteins with different functions, thus revealing the multifunctional nature of the nucleolus (Ahmad et al., 2009). Nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23 (nucleophosmin) are three major proteins that represent approximately 20% of the total nucleolar protein content and that are highly conserved in structure and function within eukaryotes (Dumbar et al., 1989; Tollervey et al., 1993; Allain et al., 2000).",

The frequency of PML NBs depends on cell type and condition, varying from 3 to 30 per cell (Ascoli and Maul, 1991). Several studies have shown that PML NBs are dynamic, macromolecular structures that represent accumulations of multiple cellular proteins, whose only common known feature is their ability to be SUMOylated (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007). Probably the most important components of PML NBs are Sp100, hDaxx and PML. These proteins have several isoforms and motifs, such as SUMOylation sites (PML, hDaxx and Sp100), a RING finger motif (PML), SUMO\u2010interacting motifs (PML, hDaxx and Sp100) and a SAND domain (Sp100) that are involved in PML formation and functionality (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The multifunctional nature of many nucleolar proteins may explain the usurpation and incorporation of these proteins into replication and translation complexes formed by RNA as well as DNA viruses. The best example for this is the interaction between picornaviruses and nucleolin followed by blocking of nuclear import pathways (Gustin and Sarnow, 2002). These dramatic changes in the nuclear pore complex result in an accumulation of nucleolin in the cytoplasm of infected cells. After accumulation, nucleolin interacts with the 5\u2032 non\u2010coding region of the poliovirus genome known as internal ribosome entry site (IRES). IRESes are RNA structural elements that function in the binding of ribosomes to the mRNA and initiate translation of mRNA in a cap\u2010independent manner (Hellen and Sarnow, 2001), and therefore nucleolin interaction with the IRES element stimulates IRES\u2010dependent translation (Izumi et al., 2001). Nucleolin can also interact with the poliovirus 3\u2032 non\u2010coding region, which is implicated in the regulation of negative\u2010strand RNA synthesis (Waggoner and Sarnow, 1998). Moreover, interaction of picornaviruses with the nucleolar proteins not only facilitates viral replication but also leads to the shutdown of host cell transcription. Aminev and co\u2010authors showed that encephalomyocarditis virus proteins 2A and 3BCD localize in the nucleoli and inhibit cellular mRNA transcription but not rRNA transcription (Aminev et al., 2003). Another study done by Aminev showed that human rhinovirus 3C protease precursors also localize in the nucleoli of infected cells and inhibit cellular RNA transcription through proteolytic mechanisms (Amineva et al., 2004). Virus\u2010induced shutdown of the host\u2010cell transcription may inhibit intracellular defence mechanisms and may free the translational machinery for viral replication.",

Similarly, high throughput proteomics was used to analyse protein content of Vero cells infected with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and protein content of 293\u2010T cells infected with influenza A virus. Proteomic analyses revealed that global nucleolar proteome change did not occur in influenza A virus and IBV infected cells, and only a subset of nucleolar proteins changed in abundance (2010a, 2010b).",

It has been shown that adenoviruses inhibit the synthesis, processing and exit of the 18S and 28S species of rRNA (Castiglia and Flint, 1983) and disrupt the nucleolus at late time of infection (Walton et al., 1989). More recent studies done by Matthews and colleagues showed that the adenovirus core protein V is delivered to the nucleus and is associated with the nucleolus, leading to the mass relocation of nucleolin to the cytoplasm (Matthews and Russell, 1998; Matthews, 2001). Examination of the adenoviral genome revealed potential binding sites for nucleolin. Thus, nucleolin may interfere with adenoviral replication via its ability to bind and repress transcription (Yang et al., 1994). Therefore, adenovirus\u2010induced displacement of nucleolin appears to constitute an important step towards the antagonization of host obstacles. It has also been shown that B23.1, B23.2 and UBF (upstream binding factor) interact with viral proteins in replication centres and stimulate adenovirus DNA replication independently (Okuwaki et al., 2001; Lawrence et al., 2006; Hindley et al., 2007). And finally, proteomic analyses identified quantitative changes in 351 proteins of the nucleolus during adenovirus infection, finally corroborating that the nucleolus is extensively targeted and modified by adenoviruses (Lam et al., 2010).",

It was speculated that viral (particularly RNA viral) proteins might accumulate at the nucleolus as a result of diffusion through the nuclear pore complex and association with the nuclear compartments that have high RNA content, and therefore within the nucleolus because it is transcriptionally active. Although the characterization of viral life cycles determined the accumulation of several specific viral proteins within the nucleolus, until recently there was huge gap in our knowledge about the consequences.",

The function of Rev is to bind HIV RNA and assist the transportation of spliced and unspliced RNA to the cytoplasm, and therefore it is likely that the nucleolus plays a critical role in HIV\u20101 RNA export (Michienzi et al., 2000). The Tat is a key regulator of HIV\u20101 replication, and studies strongly suggest that the nucleolus is implicated in the regulation of Tat activity and consequently in HIV\u20101 replication (Wei et al., 1998; Michienzi et al., 2002).",

The observation that HSV\u20101 affects PML NBs, whereas an ICP0\u2010deficient mutant does not, led to the identification of the importance of ICP0 for this effect (Maul et al., 1993; Everett and Maul, 1994). The ICP0 protein contains a RING finger domain with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, which induces the degradation of PML, leading to the release of other proteins of PML NBs (Parkinson and Everett, 2000). Proteins with similar, ND10\u2010modifying functions have been identified for other herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (pp71 and IE1) and Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBNA LP). The cytomegalovirus structural protein pp71 accumulates at PML NBs and is able to induce the proteasomal degradation of hDaxx (Saffert and Kalejta, 2006). Thus, pp71 can antagonize the cellular repression of immediate early gene expression. Consequently, the IE72 protein is synthesized, which then localizes to PML NBs and dissociates them through an abrogation of PML SUMOylation (Kang et al., 2006). In case of Epstein\u2010Barr virus, EBNA LP dislocates Sp100 from PML NB, leading to an alteration of this nuclear body (Ling et al., 2005).",

By screening a variety of Ad5 mutants, viral E4 ORF3 early protein was identified as key protein that induces the rearrangement of PML NBs into track\u2010like structures. Until recently the significance of E4 ORF3\u2010induced PML NBs track formation was obscure. Recent studies by Ullman and colleagues showed that the replication of an E4 ORF3 deletion virus is restricted in cells that are pretreated with IFN\u2010\u03b1 or IFN\u2010\u03b3, thus revealing the role of E4 ORF3 in viral counteraction against IFN\u2010induced antiviral response (Ullman et al., 2007). The exact mechanism by which E4 ORF3 helps Ad5 to overcome PML NBs is still unclear. Instead, it was reported that another Ad5 protein, E1B\u201055K, may induce the degradation of hDaxx by a proteasome\u2010dependent pathway, thus antagonizing the antiviral activity of PML NBs (Schreiner et al., 2010). This finding demonstrates that E4 ORF3 is most probably not the only adenoviral protein involved in viral countermeasures against ND10, and further studies may reveal additional proteins like E1B\u201055K.",

This and several other findings implicate PML in an intrinsic antiviral response of the cell that targets not only DNA but also RNA viruses (Djavani et al., 2001; Bonilla et al., 2002; Blondel et al., 2010). Like DNA viruses, RNA viruses have evolved different ways to impair the cellular antiviral response. For example, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus RING finger protein Z with an unknown function targets and redistributes PML to the cytoplasm (Borden et al., 1998). Rabies virus phosphoprotein P and four other amino\u2010terminally truncated products (P2, P3, P4 and P5) are involved in virus\u2010induced reorganization of PML NBs (Blondel et al., 2002). Encephalomyocarditis virus 3C protease co\u2010localizes with PML within nuclear bodies and induces the degradation of PML in a proteasome\u2010 and SUMO\u2010dependent manner (El McHichi et al., 2010).
