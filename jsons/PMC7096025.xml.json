            "text": "In recent years advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppression have improved not only survival rates but also the quality of life for patients with transplanted organs [1]. Hence, the number of women of childbearing age who decide to have a child\u2014which indicates the resumption of a normal life\u2014has increased [2, 3]. Most studies have focused on pregnancy outcomes of women who have kidney transplants, but only small cohorts, from individual centres, of women who have liver, heart and pancreas transplants have been studied [4, 5]. The most pressing questions that have been raised concern the administration of immunosuppressive drugs and the effects that they might have on the developing foetus, the course of pregnancy, childbirth and transplant-related complications [6, 7]. Pre-term births and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are frequently encountered. According to some studies, the miscarriage rate is higher than in the general population. Foetal malformations, ranging from labiopalatoschisis to heart defects, have been reported [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Furthermore, the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on the immune system of the developing foetus are still not clear [20, 31, 32, 33, 34]. This retrospective study focuses on pregnancy outcomes of women after they had undergone organ transplantation observed by a multicentre transplant group in Italy. It is the first survey of this kind ever carried out in Italy.",

            "text": "According to the official guidelines, women who have undergone transplant surgery must be tested for stable graft function and must be maintained on immunosuppression before planning to have a baby in order to minimize risks [5, 25]. Most pregnancies in patients with normal and stable organ function had no effect on the graft function or survival; in contrast, a deterioration in graft function represents a significant risk of graft loss within 2 years of delivery [25, 28, 47]. In some reports acute rejection during, or within 3 months after, pregnancy ranges between 9% and 14.5%. In our series, rejection occurred in two kidney transplant recipients, one of which was definitive (2.1%). This was reported by previous studies showing that the incidence of clinically diagnosed rejection of renal allografts during pregnancy was unchanged and not higher than expected for non-pregnant allograft recipients [26, 38, 48]. This probably means that the centres involved in this survey carried out a careful and thorough assessment of the clinical and biological parameters before the patients decided to have a baby.",

An increased abortion rate was also observed by other authors [2, 3, 26, 27, 45]. The percentage of caesarean sections in our study is 91.1%, as opposed to 23% in the general population [47]. This is partly because of the need to plan the baby\u2019s birth, partly due to the occurrence of maternal (i.e. hypertension and bilateral necrosis of the femur head) or foetal (IUGR) complications. It should not be overlooked, however, that after kidney transplantation natural childbirth may be unadvisable because of the location of the transplanted organ. In other series the rate of post-transplantation caesarean sections was lower that observed in our study, but still higher than in the general population. Albeit difficult to explain, this difference may be the result of the guidelines issued by the obstetrics centres. Four patients had two pregnancies at term, without complications or transplant rejection. This agrees with other reports in the literature concerning women with transplants who had more than one pregnancy [40].",

In our cohort the average interval between transplantation and pregnancy was longer (64 months, but in one case only 1 year had elapsed). In line with our previous experience, the study shows that patients with transplanted organs can give birth to healthy infants so long as they are monitored accurately during pregnancy [23, 24, 25, 28, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 47]. However, these pregnancies are to be regarded as a high risk and require a multi-disciplinary approach. It is crucial for patients to consult the doctor before deciding to have a baby; this is the best time to understand the pregnancy-related risks for the infant and the mother, even with regard to her life expectancy. Even the possibility that the same disease that made the transplant necessary for the mother might be transmitted to the foetus has to be taken into account.",
