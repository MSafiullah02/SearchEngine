Toxic pneumonitis may account for 16% of all pulmonary events in this setting [2], and long-term adverse effects of treatments require prolonged follow-up in regard to the development of nonneoplastic and neoplastic conditions in heart and lung [3]. Noninfectious pulmonary complications represent a real challenge to the practitioner who needs be wary of the multitude of drug-, radiation- and procedure-induced adverse effects. Drug-induced respiratory disease in hematology patients may manifest acutely or subacutely by hypersensitivity reactions (bronchospasm, anaphylaxis), pulmonary edema, acute lung injury (ALI), an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) picture, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with or without tissue eosinophilia, pleural effusion or pulmonary vasculopathy.",

The diagnosis is made against [1] pulmonary involvement from the underlying benign (e.g., sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, polycythemia vera) or malignant hematologic condition (e.g., acute and chronic leukemias, Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, multiple myeloma), [2] alveolar hemorrhage, [3] circulatory overload, left ventricular dysfunction and [4] an opportunistic viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan infection with few reliable clinical or imaging discriminators to separate these entities. To complicate matters, there is often little time for establishing the diagnosis and initiating appropriate therapy before the patient\u2019s condition deteriorates irreversibly. Patients who require mechanical ventilatory support have an ominous outcome. There is almost no specific pattern of drug-induced lung involvement on pathology. Thus, the lung biopsy is mainly used to rule out diagnoses other than drugs, and patients suspected of having drug-induced lung disease may be managed conservatively using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and microbiological tests as the main diagnostic tools. Drug discontinuance followed by resolution of symptoms is a simple test that may aid in the recognition of drug-induced disease.",

Drug-induced disease is more complex to diagnose in patients with a background of hematologic malignancy who received several potentially pneumotoxic drugs, each having different times for drug-induced disease to present, and/or who have received radiation therapy, blood transfusions or have a history of exposure to oxygen or corticosteroids. Such patients are likely to be severely immunocompromised under the combined influence of underlying illness, drugs used to treat their condition, corticosteroid and radiation therapy, and an opportunistic lung infection is a strong consideration [4]. Diagnosing drug-induced disease is even more complex in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants, who in addition to the above complications, may develop several distinctive post-transplant manifestations, including engraftment syndrome, pulmonary edema, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and late-onset noninfectious pulmonary complications including idiopathic pulmonary syndrome (IPS) [5, 6]. In rare instances, pulmonary complications develop in hematopoietic stem cell donors in the form of pulmonary infiltrates during colony-stimulating factor-(CSF)-induced stem cell mobilization [7].",

Sometimes, the pattern of pulmonary involvement from these drugs is distinctive and can still be detected even though the drug is part of a multiagent chemotherapy or conditioning regimen. Establishing which drug in the regimen causes the lung injury is useful, for it may enable withholding the specific drug instead of all drugs in the regimen. Diagnosing drug-induced lung disease is not of pure academic interest. An important practical consequence is selective drug withdrawal while other nonpneumotoxic drugs are continued to the benefit of the patient. Although rechallenge was once considered hazardous and still is with many drugs, rechallenge and steroid-supported rechallenge can be attempted with vital drugs such as imatinib or dasatinib.",

            "text": "Criteria for diagnosis include the following [10]:\nCorrect identification of the drug [11]Dose and duration of treatment with each drug taken in isolation or in a chemotherapy regimen should be reviewed. Causality is more difficult to assess when several pneumotoxic drugs were received concomitantly or in sequence. The likelihood and delay time for drug-induced disease to present vary with drug, dosage, whether the drug was coadministered with other pneumotoxic drugs and the patient. Patients of Asian descent may be at increased risk for certain drug-induced pulmonary complications. It is also necessary to compute exposure to G/GM-CSF, blood and blood components (e.g., fresh frozen plasma, whole blood-derived platelets), anesthetic agents, oxygen, parenteral nutrition and nonhematologic drugs, for all of these may effectuate lung injury [11].Temporal eligibilityRespiratory signs and symptoms should follow (not predate) the onset of treatment with the suspected drug. Time to onset of the respiratory reaction varies with drug, host, schedule of administration and pattern of involvement. The shorter the latency period is, the easier the suggestion of the drug etiology. Longer delay times increase the likelihood that the drug etiology goes unrecognized. Drug-induced- bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, pulmonary edema (e.g., gemcitabine- or acaytine-induced), acute lung injury (e.g., transfusion-related acute lung injury or TRALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and alveolar hemorrhage tend to develop shortly after exposure to the causal agent, with a time to onset of minutes to hours or at most a few days. Instead, it may take weeks, months or years for drug- (viz. methotrexate, azathioprine or thalidomide) induced cellular interstitial pneumonia to develop. Drug- and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis develops after months or years into treatment or after termination of treatment. For instance, patients who received busulfan, cyclophosphamide, nitrosoureas or radiation therapy in the past may be diagnosed with iatrogenic pulmonary fibrosis or the idiopathic pulmonary syndrome many years later [12, 13].Drug singularityAssessment of causality is problematic if patients were exposed to several pneumotoxic drugs. This creates confusion about which drug is responsible for the lung reaction, and it may at times be impossible to sort this out. In patients treated with several chemotherapy agents, drug toxicity may develop at dosages of each drug that are lower than the threshold above which drug toxicity develops when the drug is taken in isolation. Weighing the responsibility of each drug taken separately is critical regarding future management of the underlying hematologic disease. Identification of the causal drug may enable selective cessation of the culprit drug. A review on nonhematology drugs is indicated, as many drugs can injure the lung [11]Whether the pulmonary reaction is appropriate for the particular drugThe pattern of involvement from some drugs can be suggestive, owing to the close temporal relationship of exposure versus onset of respiratory symptoms (e.g., the swift development of pulmonary infiltrates following treatments with anti-thymocyte globulin, gemcitabine, ATRA, cytarabine or blood transfusion (TRALI) [14]. For other drugs it is because the clinical, imaging, BAL and/or pathologic pattern of involvement is distinctive [e.g., bleomycin and bibasilar shadowing or multiple lung nodules, cyclophosphamide and severe pleuropulmonary involvement, imatinib or dasatinib and pleural effusion, methotrexate and an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis with a granulomatous pattern of involvement, rituximab and ARDS; retinoic acid (ATRA) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), of BCNU/CCNU or busulfan with otherwise unexplained pulmonary fibrosis].It is difficult to predict the pathologic background of drug-induced reactions using HRCT data alone [15], and in one study of 20 patients [16], imaging and pathology were concordant in only nine cases (45%). A confirmatory lung biopsy (open or transbronchial) can be necessary in selected cases mainly to discard etiologies other than drugs rather than to prove the drug etiology. Any attempt at deducing pathology from imaging as done in some studies [17] should be viewed with caution.Exclusion of other causesThere are many diagnostic contenders to consider when pulmonary infiltrates develop in patients with hematologic disease treated with drugs. These include the pulmonary manifestations of the native benign or malignant hematologic condition (for instance, pulmonary involvement from malignant lymphoma [15] or acute leukemia [18], extramedullary hematopoiesis [19], multiple myeloma [20\u201322], interstitial lung disease including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis that may occur in association with untreated hematologic diseases [23]), capillary leak, tumor lysis syndrome, cardiac pulmonary edema, an opportunistic viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan infections including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, a common encounter in hematology patients [24\u201328], and a graft-versus-host reaction [29]. All of these can produce similar patterns of involvement on imaging. The BAL and TBLB with appropriate sample staining, culture and molecular techniques should be routinely performed to help exclude an infection [2]. Heart ultrasonography and diuresis may also aid in the recognition of drug-induced vs. cardiogenic pulmonary edema.Remission of signs and symptoms with removal of the drugSigns and symptoms typically clear after drug removal. However, fulminate iatrogenic reactions to drugs (e.g., drug-induced pulmonary edema, TRALI, methotrexate pneumonitis, bleomycin lung) may progress despite removal. Similarly, pulmonary fibrosis induced by drugs or that develops as a late consequence of conditioning regimens often is an irreversible process that may not respond to drug discontinuance. Corticosteroid therapy is often given to patients with severe drug-induced lung disease to accelerate recovery. However, this is at the expense of drug causality assessment.Recurrence with rechallengeRechallenge followed by recurrence is central to the diagnosis of any drug-induced disease [10], but seldom is performed intentionally because of risks [30]. Of note, drug-induced pleuropulmonary reactions to imatinib [31], dasatinib [32] or antithymocyte globulin [33] were shown not to relapse in all patients upon reexposure, enabling continued treatment of the underlying hematologic disease. Rechallenge is reserved for cases where the drug is vital, there is no alternative efficacious drug to treat the underlying condition, and it is given in small incremental doses of the drug and corticosteroid therapy.Tests may support the diagnosis of DILDBAL is instrumental in ruling out an infection and may show an increased percentage of lymphocytes, eosinophils or neutrophils depending on which drug caused the reaction (for a review, see [14]).Studies of peripheral or BAL lymphocyte activation or migration following in vitro challenge with the suspected drug have produced inconsistent results, and overall, evidence for the usefulness of this test is low, and there is a lack of consensus about the appropriateness of these tests inasmuch as in a recent series, there was no correlation of lymphocyte stimulation with the clinical result effect of rechallenge with the drug [34].KL-6 has been found to be elevated in some patients with drug-induced fibrosis. However, this marker remained normal in cases of pulmonary toxicity from rituximab, methotrexate and radiation therapy. Similarly, time-related changes in plasma or BAL TGF-\u00df1 and IL1 in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy yielded inconsistent results, and there is no consensus regarding their measurements in routine.Areas of drug-, radiation- and talc-induced reactions can be tracer-avid on FDG-PET scans [35].\n",

            "text": "Drug-induced cellular interstitial pneumonia, also known as alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is a common pattern of pulmonary reaction to drugs [11]. Drugs causing cellular interstitial pneumonia in hematology include azacytidine, azathioprine, chlorambucil, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine), cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dasatinib, floxuridine, fludarabine, GM-CSF, gemtuzumab, hydroxurea, imatinib, interferon alpha and beta, lenalidomide, methotrexate, procarbazine, rituximab, thalidomide, vinca alkaloids and chest radiation therapy [11]. Time to onset is a few days to several years into treatment and is unpredictable as serial pulmonary function is not capable of predicting development of this complication. Onset of the disease may be insidious over a few days or weeks, with moderate fever followed by the development of cough and breathlessness. Methotrexate lung is known to accelerate, causing rapidly progressive respiratory failure. Radiographic studies indicate bilateral, usually symmetrical interstitial or alveolar ground-glass opacities, mosaic attenuation or consolidation. The infiltrates may predominate in the lung bases and mid-lung zones, or they can be diffuse. Radiographic attenuation can be a discrete haze, ground-glass, inter- or intralobular septal thickening, a crazy-paving, mosaic appearance or dense bilateral consolidation with air bronchograms [38\u201342]. A miliary pattern, pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph node enlargement are occasional features of methotrexate lung [36, 43]. Imaging features may not enable the separation of ILD due to drugs from infectious pneumonia or from the manifestations of the underlying hematologic condition [26, 44, 45]. Pulmonary function indicates restrictive physiology and impaired gas exchange [36]. Physiology tends to correlate with the extent of involvement on imaging [46] except in azathioprine pneumonitis and bleomycin lung [47, 48]. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and BAL are indicated to rule out an infection. The BAL usually shows a lymphocyte predominance [49]. The contribution of lymphocyte typing is unclear, because increases in both CD4+ or CD8+ subsets have been observed depending on time from onset of pneumonitis and whether the patient has received corticosteroid therapy [50]. A low ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ lymphocytes is suggestive for the drug etiology, but this is not a specific finding. Other BAL patterns include neutrophilia or a pattern of lymphocytosis and neutrophilia or eosinophilia. BAL samples should be processed with special stains, cultures and molecular techniques for the detection of bacteria, fungi and protozoa and viruses, including the recently recognized metapneumovirus and H1N1 [51]. A lung biopsy may be required in selected cases, since drug-induced lung disease may be a mimic of Pneumocystis pneumonia [52] and other opportunistic infections [53]. The TBLB approach can document interstitial pneumonia although sample size may be an issue. Histopathological features include interstitial inflammation, edema and a cellular interstitial infiltrate. Less common findings include granulomas during treatments with methotrexate [43], interferon [54] or lenalidomide [55], organizing pneumonia with rituximab or thalidomide, and interstitial fibrosis [43]. Alveolar edema or hemorrhage may be found as a manifestation of severe ILD [43, 56].",

Mega-doses of methylprednisolone of 1 g/day are given to patients in some countries, with no documented benefit compared to a standard dose regimen. Fatalities have been reported in patients with severe disease, particularly if corticosteroids were not given in time and in patients rechallenged with the drug [30].

Adverse reactions to methotrexate or blood transfusion can be accompanied by mild peripheral eosinophilia, but the BAL and pathologic features are not those of eosinophilic pneumonia. Onset of the condition is unpredictable. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia may produce acute respiratory failure. Unusual PIE cases present with rash and internal involvement, and this has been aptly coined DRESS for drug-rash and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms. A few DRESS cases were described with the use of azathioprine, bortezomib, hydroxyurea and imatinib [59]. On imaging, PIE is in the form of the photographic negative of pulmonary edema, or it is disseminated with faint shadowing, discreet ground-glass, Kerley \u201cB\u201d lines, or dense and diffuse infiltrates. An increase in blood, BAL and/or lung tissue eosinophils is diagnostic. The lung biopsy rarely is required and shows an interstitial infiltrate of eosinophils admixed with mononuclear cells. Drug discontinuance is indicated. Corticosteroids are reserved for severe cases. Outcome is good.",

            "text": "Organizing pneumonia (OP/BOOP) is a distinctive pattern of lung response to a few drugs and to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well, which is best defined by the pathologic finding of alveolar and ductal buds of connective tissue or fibrosis. Strictly speaking, organizing pneumonia is best diagnosed when a large sample of lung tissue is available for review to make sure BOOP is not an incidental finding among other more distinctive pathologic features. Claimed cases of BOOP without pathologic evidence are equivocal. This is not trivial, for pulmonary aspergillosis and BOOP can be indistinguishable on imaging [53]. Causal drugs used to treat hematologic conditions include bleomycin, busulfan (mostly the acute busulfan lung), cyclophosphamide, interferon, lenalidomide, rituximab, thalidomide and chemotherapy [11, 62]. At any rate, the diagnosis of drug-induced BOOP is against the background of BOOP, which can occur as a late noninfectious pulmonary complication in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [5]. BOOP can manifest with chest pain, dyspnea and areas of consolidation or without respiratory failure [63], or it is discovered incidentally on imaging [64]. Nodular organizing pneumonia is a distinctive pattern of bleomycin pulmonary toxicity and is in the form of round-shaped areas of consolidation that may localize in lung bases and simulate metastatic lung disease [65]. A lung biopsy may be required to exclude this possibility [66], although clinical reasoning and observation coupled to 18F-dideoxyglucose PET scanning may suffice [67]. There is no BAL pattern that is characteristic of this condition. The percentage of lymphocytes and/or of neutrophils or eosinophils can be increased. If a lung biopsy is contemplated, the video-assisted approach is preferred as a larger sample lends greater support to the diagnosis. Histology reveals interstitial inflammation, superimposed on the dominant background of alveolar and ductal fibrosis [68]. Some patients present with overlapping features of organizing and eosinophilic pneumonia [66]. Drug discontinuation with corticosteroid therapy in severe cases is followed by improvement.",

            "text": "The treatment of hematologic malignancies with chemotherapy agents, particularly alkylating agents but not exclusively so, may induce a pattern of lung derangements termed the \u201cchemotherapy lung,\u201d a wide-ranging term [14, 69]. Patients treated for leukemia, particularly patients with high blast counts during remission induction [70], Hodgkin\u2019s disease or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and recipients of bone marrow or stem cell transplant are at risk. The entity refers to nonhemodynamic, noninfectious and nonneoplastic pulmonary complications, which develop in a variable proportion of patients (<1\u201360% in some phase I or II studies) following administration of single-agent (e.g., BCNU or other nitrosoureas, bleomycin, bortezomib, busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, gemcitabine, melphalan, methotrexate, procarbazine, vinblastine) or multi-agent chemotherapy, particularly when drugs were used at elevated dosages or there is an association of several lung-toxic drugs with or without radiation therapy in the treatment schedule [71\u201373]. Substitution of one agent in a chemotherapy regimen can markedly alter the safety profile. For instance, in patients with de novo-treated Hodgkin\u2019s disease, the substitution of gemcitabine with dacarbazine in the ABVD regimen [doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastin, gemcitabine instead of dacarbazine (ABVG)] resulted in an unacceptable 42% incidence rate of pulmonary toxicity [74]. Likewise, in a phase I/II dose-escalation study in 27 patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin\u2019s disease, the substitution of gemcitabine for etoposide in the escalated BEACOPP regimen (bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone and gemcitabine instead of etoposide) resulted in pulmonary toxicity in 29.6% of the patients [75]. Crucially, the disease needs be separated from an infection, mainly pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jiroveci or viral agents [76], acute heart failure and an acute transfusion reaction [77, 78]. If investigation of the sputum, BAL, blood and other fluids is unrevealing, especially on two consecutive evaluations for an infection, the diagnosis of chemotherapy lung is entertained further. It is challenging to assess the specific responsibility of each drug in the regimen to the syndrome if patients have received several pneumotoxic agents concomitantly or in sequence. Assessing causality is important though, for identification of the causal drug may allow selective drug discontinuation rather than withdrawal of all drugs in the chemotherapy regimen. It may be possible to discern methotrexate or bleomycin pulmonary toxicity when it occurs in patients receiving a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. For instance, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients who received m-BACOD or m-ACOD regimens developed a picture similar to methotrexate lung, whereas no pulmonary infiltrates were observed in patients receiving the CHOP regimen, which does not include methotrexate [79]. Similarly, the different incidence of pulmonary events in two arms of a therapeutic regimen that differed by only one drug (for instance with or without bleomycin, BCNU, CSF, gemcitabine, or radiation therapy) or by the dosage of one particular drug (e.g., low vs. high BCNU) enabled deducing which drug was exactly causing the reaction [80]. The likelihood of developing chemotherapy lung is increased when radiation therapy to the chest, TBI, oxygen, and possibly CSFs are given concomitantly. The term \u2018chemotherapy lung\u2019 is not ideal, because non-chemotherapy agents such as ATRA, IL-2 and imatinib, oxygen, transfusion of blood or proteins including IVIG, infusion of stem cells, radiation therapy and nonchemo agents can also cause the syndrome [11].",

Others present with bilateral interstitial and/or alveolar shadowing, which abates after discontinuation of the drugs and/or corticosteroid therapy [91]. Yet other patients with severe presentation progress to respiratory failure and respiratory death despite drug discontinuation [92]. The HRCT discloses scattered ground-glass haze, inter- and/or intralobular septal thickening or areas of condensation [40]. If patients are able to withstand the test, pulmonary function is restrictive, and hypoxemia is present. The diffusing capacity is decreased, and typically the decrease predates the onset of symptoms or the development of radiographic abnormalities. The changes are progressive or can be reactivated with further treatment with the causal drug, notably bleomycin or rituximab, and careful follow-up is needed before any further administration of the drug is contemplated [73, 90].

Judicious use of lung biopsy may help to diagnose an infection and tailor treatment accordingly [2, 85]. However, the critical condition of these patients often precludes this option, as the procedure is associated with increased mortality when it is done in patients with significant respiratory impairment. In the setting of chemotherapy, the respective benefit of a minimally invasive approach with drug removal, empiric treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids [95] as opposed to the more invasive approach remains unclear [96]. A fraction of patients respond favorably to drug discontinuation and corticosteroid drugs, especially if the condition is recognized early. For instance, in a series of 65 patients with hematologic malignancies who received a carmustine-based conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation, 17 (26%) developed pulmonary infiltrates thought to be drug-induced. Of these, 15 responded to corticosteroids [97]. One patient died of pneumonitis [97]. Corticosteroids should be tapered carefully to avoid catastrophic respiratory failure [98, 99]. Despite occasional success with immunosuppressive drugs [100], the response to treatment and the prognosis of this condition when it is advanced, when corticosteroids fail or when ventilatory support is required are disappointing. Chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity may also negatively impact on the management of the underlying hematologic disease, as a change in therapy may be required toward less efficacious or more toxic drugs.",

            "text": "The high incidence, severity and unpredictability of pulmonary complications from chemotherapy raise the question of whether early detection is meaningful using pulmonary function tests or imaging. Deterioration of indices of pulmonary function is common in patients exposed to chemotherapeutic agents [105, 106], including conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [107]. Changes cannot be predicted on an individual basis and occur more in patients who receive TBI in addition to drugs. Corticosteroids may mitigate or reverse these changes [107]. In the majority of patients, though, these subclinical changes do not predict the development of overt disease. In contrast, exposure to methotrexate does not alter lung functions [108]. Some investigators believe it is prudent to discontinue chemotherapy once the diffusing capacity has decreased to <50% of pretherapy values, while others do not rely on this measurement since it is their belief that the diffusing capacity does not equate to and may not predict toxicity, and there is the risk of unnecessarily withdrawing an effective chemotherapy [109]. An abrupt fall in the monthly measurement of the diffusing capacity may indicate impending toxicity. When radiation therapy is planned after administration of chemotherapeutic agents, it is advisable to wait for any chemotherapy-induced decrease in the diffusing capacity to stabilize or show a trend toward improvement, before the patient undergoes radiation therapy [90]. Although changes on imaging are common in patients receiving bleomycin or rituximab, it is impractical to rely on imaging to detect changes consistent with pulmonary toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients on chemotherapy may develop new opacities on CT although they never develop symptomatic disease [110]. There is no current agreement as to how patients on chemotherapy should be followed to reliably and cost-effectively detect meaningful therapy-induced pulmonary complications. However, many treating physicians have a chest radiograph, PFT and diffusing capacity measured serially during treatment, particularly if patients are being treated with bleomycin.",

Less often, drug-induced fibrosis complicates treatments with gemcitabine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate and rituximab [11]. Drug-induced fibrosis may develop during treatment with drugs or it is diagnosed after termination of treatment. Imaging prior to onset of treatment with the drug helps confirm the time course of lung changes with respect to exposure to the drug or drugs, and enables separation from fibrosis of other causes. Early disease is in the form of linear or streaky opacities and loss of volume. Honeycombing is a late and inconsistent finding. For those patients who are still on the causal drug, drug removal may not be followed by improvement, and the response to steroids is often not gratifying. On histology, there is interstitial fibrosis, and the lung structure may not be retained. A reactive epithelium is suggestive of but not specific to exposure to alkylating agents and/or radiation therapy. In children or adults who have received cyclophosphamide for the treatment of hematologic malignancy, pleural and subpleural fibrosis can develop in addition to the more classic changes of pulmonary fibrosis [114]. This results in encasing of the lung, anteroposterior narrowing of the chest and severe restrictive physiology causing respiratory failure. It is unfortunate when the syndrome develops in a child, while the basic disease is cured. A few patients who received chlorambucil or methotrexate develop accelerated pulmonary fibrosis in the form of acute interstitial pneumonia [115, 116]. The outcome of pulmonary fibrosis is poor, despite drug withdrawal and institution of high-dose corticosteroids. Lung transplantation has been an option in a few patients.",

NCPE is due to the loss of integrity of the endothelial barrier and consequent fluid leakage. NCPE is characterized by the rapid or sudden onset of dyspnea, hypoxemia and alveolar infiltrates, with no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction or iatrogenic circulatory overload [although drugs used to treat malignancies may cause deterioration of cardiac function and cardiogenic pulmonary edema [117\u2013121]. There is often close temporal association of exposure to the drug, onset of dyspnea and the development of pulmonary infiltrates. Chemotherapeutic agents associated with NCPE include ATG, cytosine arabinoside, all-transretinoic acid (ATRA), amphotericin-B, arsenic trioxide (As2O3), bleomycin, blood and blood components, carmustine, CSF, cyclophosphamide, deferoxamine, docetaxel, doxorubicine, fludarabine, gemcitabine, interleu-kin-2, methotrexate, mitomycin, radiocontrast agents, rituximab, vinorelbine and vinblastine and several multiagent chemotherapy regimens [11, 122]. Most patients present with NCPE as an isolated finding, but in a few, weight gain, lower extremity or more diffuse edema and pleural and/or pericardial effusions suggest capillary leak [122, 123]. Pathology indicates bland pulmonary edema, with proteinaceous fluid filling most alveolar spaces and sometimes diffuse alveolar damage with little or no inflammation [37]. Severe cases can be fatal, but in most the infiltrates resolve with supportive care and corticosteroid therapy.",

Although a downward trend in mortality has been noted in more recent years (1980\u20131995) compared to the prior treatment era (1962\u20131980), second cancers and cardiovascular complications still account for 20% and 14% of late deaths, respectively [152]. The risk of second or higher-order lung cancer in Hodgkin\u2019s disease and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is increased [153], and it correlates with the dose of radiation delivered to the lung, amount of chemotherapeutic agents received and whether the patient is a smoker. In one study, the relative risk of lung cancer in patients who received \u22659.6 Gy was 9.6 compared to <1 Gy. Patients who had smoked >10 pack-years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin\u2019s disease had a further sixfold increase in risk, compared with patients who smoked <1 pack-year. A positive interaction on a multiplicative scale was observed between the carcinogenic effects of smoking and radiation [103]. Studies have found a positive interaction between treatment with MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone), the number of cycles and the risk of lung cancer [154]. Radiation therapy added to the risk [155]. In another study, treatment with MOPP was associated with a greater risk of lung cancer, compared to chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone [156]. Since tobacco use appears to synergize the risks from treatments and increase lung cancer risk more than 15- to 20-fold, physicians treating these patients need to be wary of the risk and should make a special effort to dissuade patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease from smoking after receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Smoking cessation is a vital part of long-term management of such patients.",

The administration of ATRA during induction of remission is often followed in a few days by a sharp increase in the number of circulating myeloid cells and neutrophils. This is temporally associated in some patients with the development of fever, weight gain, pleuritic chest pain, pleural or pericardial effusion, lower extremity edema, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, or an ARDS picture [166\u2013169]. This aggregate of symptoms developed an average of 8 days after initiation of treatment and is grouped under the eponym \u201cretinoic acid- or ATRA syndrome\u201d [166]. Similar manifestations are observed in patients who receive As2O3 in up to 31% in one study [170], causing respiratory death [171]. The condition is also referred to as ATRA or retinoic acid syndrome. Onset of ATRA syndrome can be heralded by an increase in circulating neutrophils. Patients with neutrophil counts above 10,000/\u03bcL are considered at risk of developing the syndrome, while the condition is considered unusual in leukopenic patients [166]. ATRA syndrome is thought to result from the sequestration of activated neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries, leading to acute lung injury and vascular leakage. Radiographic studies indicate ill-defined infiltrates, ground-glass opacities, lung nodules that may progress to diffuse alveolar shadows, and pleural effusions [172]. Blasts and promyelocytes containing Auer rods were evidenced in the BAL in one case [173]. Post-mortem studies indicate maturing and mature myeloid cells within the pulmonary interstitium [166]. Capillaritis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage have been reported once [174]. Patients improve on drug removal and high-dose corticosteroids [166]. Prophylactic corticosteroids have decreased both the severity and incidence of ATRA syndrome down to about 8% [175]. Mortality from ATRA syndrome is about 8% or 1% of all patients treated with these agents. In most cases, ATRA therapy can be reinstituted once the syndrome has resolved [176], although at 75% of the initial dosage [177]. ATRA may also cause venous thromboembolism and infarction in several end organs, including the lung [178]. As2O3 may also cause adverse cardiac effects [179].",

            "text": "The bis-chlororethyl nitrosourea (BCNU, carmustine) drug derives from the vesicant chemical warfare mustard. BCNU is an alkylating agent introduced in 1963 in the treatment of malignant brain tumors because of its low molecular weight. Currently, BCNU is used for the treatment of high-risk breast carcinoma and as a conditioning regimen for bone marrow and stem cell transplantation along with busulfan or cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). BCNU and TBI are thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy lung and idiopathic pulmonary syndrome (see above). The lower incidence of idiopathic pulmonary complications with nonmyeloablative as opposed to myeloablative preconditioning regimens supports the causal role of the intensity of the conditioning regimen in its development. The pulmonary complications of BCNU when the drug was used as a solo agent have been described in children and in adults, and BCNU has caused pulmonary toxicity more often than the other nitrosoureas CCNU (lomustine), DCNU (chlorozotocin), methyl-CCNU, streptozotocine, fotemustine, and estramustine. Carmustine lung damage is dose-related, and the incidence is between 1% and 10%. BCNU pulmonary toxicity is one form of chemotherapy lung, and it resembles clinically, pathologically and on imaging the pneumonitis induced by bleomycin, busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and vinblastine. A total dose of 1,000\u20131,200 mg/m2 of BCNU is considered the threshold above which the incidence of pulmonary toxicity increases steeply when the drug is used as a single agent [183]. Incidence of BCNU toxicity increases about tenfold when cyclophospamide or irradiation is given concomitantly. Up to two thirds of patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and BCNU develop clinical and physiological evidence of pulmonary toxicity [184]. An attempt to reduce pulmonary toxicity in a modified CBV regimen using CCNU instead of BCNU followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in 16 patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin\u2019s disease or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was associated with a 63% incidence of interstitial pneumonitis, and 6 of 16 affected patients died of interstitial pneumonitis [185].",

The histopathological appearances of BCNU pneumonitis are similar to those from other alkylating agents with interstitial edema, diffuse alveolar damage, a reactive epithelium, and interstitial fibrosis [188\u2013190]. Less common features include pleural fibrosis [189], vascular thrombosis, venoocclusive disease, or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [187].

The characteristics of BPT may be discernible even though bleomycin is given along with other chemotherapeutic agents [193]. Even though early reports warned of the possibility of BPT after low cumulative dosages of the drug [199], for many years it was believed that bleomycin caused pulmonary toxicity only above 500 mg. In fact, although the incidence of BPT is dose-dependent [193], BPT can occur with as little as 20 or 34 mg bleomycin [200, 201]. Renal failure places patients at higher risk of developing BPT [79, 202], owing to decreased clearance of the drug. Slow as opposed to rapid i.v. infusion and intramuscular administration of bleomycin lessen the risk of BPT. Previous use of bleomycin should be considered in those patients requiring retreatment, as there is cumulative toxicity. In some but not all studies, advancing age was a risk factor for BPT. Concomitant or recent irradiation [203, 204], treatments with cyclophosphamide [205], and exposure to high concentrations of oxygen add to the risk and may trigger the onset of BPT [206]. Although not everyone will agree [207], it is prudent to request that anesthetists use the lowest possible fractional concentration of oxygen when patients with a history of exposure to bleomycin undergo any surgical procedure. In some but not all studies, a history of BPT negatively impacts overall survival of patients with malignant lymphoma [196, 208].",

            "text": "Clinically, BPT presents acutely or subacutely with dyspnea, and sometimes chest pain [134, 194, 210]. Some chest discomfort may be present at some point before BPT is suspected, representing early BPT that went unrecognized [210]. Crackles on auscultation may precede the radiographic changes of BPT. Imaging studies indicate the predominant involvement of the lung bases as opposed to the apices, costophrenic angles, and subpleural regions, and there is often generalized loss of lung volume [193, 211]. A retrospective review of chest films may show the gradual development of these changes, and it is easy to miss the actual onset of BPT. On HRCT in mild cases, a diffuse ill-defined ground-glass pattern or haze is present. Later, patients develop discrete subpleural crescent-like opacities, streaky opacities along the bronchovascular bundles, alveolar infiltrates, alveolar densities, consolidation, or the clinical-radiographic picture of ARDS [48, 194, 212, 213]. Changes on imaging correlate poorly with impairment of the diffusing capacity [48]. Some patients present with masses on imaging that may about the pleura [48, 214]. Pleural thickening or an effusion is an unusual finding. Several of the above mild HRCT findings are common (up to 80%) in asymptomatic patients during treatments with bleomycin [193]. However, they do not necessarily indicate toxicity, and drug discontinuance is not always required. In one study, such changes occurred in 15 out of 18 patients [215], none of which developed clinically recognizable disease. Thus, serial HRCT may not be a practical test to ensure early detection of BPT, which is best monitored using history, clinical examination, pulmonary function, and the chest radiograph.",

Tissue eosinophilia is uncommon and has been reported in patients with the diffuse [198, 217] and nodular (BOOP) [66] form of the disease. The development of parenchymal lung nodules in patients receiving bleomycin is almost unique to this compound, and it can be problematical [218], raising the possibility of parenchymal involvement from the underlying hematologic malignancy [66]. The area\u2019s BPT can be tracer-avid on PET scan [35, 219]. Previous imaging, time course of disease markers, earlier PET scan, and response to chemotherapy will dictate whether watchful waiting is indicated or a lung biopsy is necessary so separate these entities. Nodular BPT corresponds to the histological pattern of BOOP with or without eosinophilia in the tissue. Nodular BPT may shrink or clear in a few weeks.",

A sizable fraction of patients with BPT have reversible disease [194], even though there was evidence for fibrosis on pathology [220]. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, and, although no controlled study is available, there is clinical evidence for benefit of this form of treatment in mild or moderate BPT. Corticosteroid therapy can be without an effect in severe BPT [197]. It is considered that if patients survive the initial episode of BPT, they are likely to recover gradually [194]. Early or abrupt withdrawal of corticosteroids is discouraged, as this may lead to a severe relapse of BPT [209], and a slow taper is recommended. Some patients develop irreversible bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [221] with, ultimately, honeycomb lung and clubbing, and die from the condition [209].",

Patients received a three-course regimen consisting of vinblastine, bleomycin, and platinum. The average bleomycin dose was 555.5 units. Pulmonary physiology was serially evaluated prior to each treatment course. The diffusing capacity fell significant by 11.8% with bleomycin treatment. However, the diffusing capacity failed to predict which patients would develop clinical toxicity. The reduction in the total lung capacity had a better correlation with clinical toxicity [110]. Despite the inability of the diffusing capacity to detect patients who will develop clinical toxicity [110, 222], serial measurement of lung volumes and of diffusing capacity are still routinely performed in this population also for medical-legal reasons [223]. The diffusing capacity decreases in up to 75% of the patients treated with bleomycin, and in only a few will clinical toxicity develop [223]. Any asymptomatic impairment of the DLCO is likely to improve slowly upon termination of treatment. The lung of patients exposed to bleomycin in the remote past should be considered vulnerable, as suggested by occasional reports of unexpected ARDS after minor insults years after termination of treatment with this agent [224].",

To some extent, TRALI is avoidable and can be prevented. By definition, acute lung injury is defined by a PaO2/FIO2 ratio <300, hence the term TRALI. However, some severe TRALI cases would deserve the eponym TR-ARDS, for the PaO2/FIO2 ratio in those cases is <200. TRALI is a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that is temporally and mechanistically related to transfusion of blood and/or blood components. TRALI occurs within 6 h of transfusion. TRALI results from the sequestration of primed and activated neutrophils in the pulmonary circulation, thereby causing endothelial injury and consequent fluid leakage. TRALI is more common in ICU patients [225], and the condition adversely affects outcome. TRALI has a 10% attendant mortality and is the leading cause for transfusion-related deaths [78, 225\u2013231]. Although all blood components have been implicated in TRALI, those that contain a significant amount of plasma, namely fresh frozen plasma and whole blood-derived platelet concentrates, are exposed to a higher risk, compared to red blood cells or whole blood [230, 232]. Plasma-rich components carry a greater risk of containing a substantial quantity of antibody from a donor, which in the majority of cases is the cause of TRALI. Whole blood, immunoglobulins, stem cells, or, rarely, autologous blood have also been implicated [230, 232].",

Such antibodies are found in 60\u201385% of cases. The case for a relationship is more compelling if concordance between the antigen specificity of the leukocyte antibodies in the donor plasma and the corresponding antigen on the cells of the affected recipient is demonstrated [233]. This is found in about 50% of cases. The antibody-antigen interaction causes complement-mediated activation and sequestration of neutrophils in the pulmonary circulation and intravascular cholesterol crystal formation [234], endothelial damage, vascular leakage, and consequent pulmonary edema [230, 234, 235]. Antibodies are more prevalent in women with a history of pregnancies, and the antibody titer increases with the number of pregnancies. Antibody prevalence is lowest in men and in nulliparous women. Although this antibody-antigen hypothesis is attractive, there are antibody negative TRALI cases, TRALI can occur in neutropenic patients, and there is one cause of TRALI following auto-transfusion. Understanding and recognizing TRALI are important. The responsible donor, generally a multiparous woman with high titers of antibody, should be identified. Laboratory investigations should be undertaken in donors to identify the antibody and in the recipient to determine whether his leukocytes bear the cognate antigen. Then the TRALI case can be classified into immune or nonimmune TRALI, the blood bank should be notified to quarantine other components from the same donation until the diagnosis is confirmed, and the implicated donor is identified. The implicated donor should be deferred from further blood donation or their blood diverted to prepare plasma-poor products, not whole blood, FFP, or platelets [232].",

Incidence is higher in ICU patients and in patients with a history of recent bypass surgery, recent infection, in patients with hematologic diseases, and in those who received CSF. This is consistent with a two-hit hypothesis for TRALI, whereby pulmonary endothelial cells are first activated, and PMN are primed and sequester in the pulmonary circulation.

Severe cases are heralded by a protein-rich exudate at the mouth or in ventilator tubings [241]. Sudden intraoperative hypoxemia during blood transfusion or infusion of FFP should raise the suspicion of TRALI [242, 243]. Transient hypoxemia following blood transfusion in patients on the respirator may correspond to TRALI [238]. The main competing diagnoses include transfusion-associated circulatory overload or TACO (both conditions can coexist), transfusion-related sepsis, anaphylaxis, and hemolytic reactions [244]. Imaging studies and measurement of BNP levels may aid in separating TACO from TRALI [245], and an important distinction for diuretics is contraindicated in TRALI [230]. Once TRALI is suspected, laboratory investigation should be undertaken on the remains of transfused products, in the recipient, and in donors whose blood or component were given within 6 h prior to the development of TRALI for the presence of antibodies [226]. Retrospective investigation can evidence an antibody in one donor in the pool in up 89% of cases [246], and a cognate antigen-antibody correlation was identified in 14 of 16 TRALI cases in one study [247].",

Nowadays, busulfan is mainly used in conditioning prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, where busulfan pulmonary toxicity is enhanced by drug dosage as seen in recipients of autologous stem cell transplant [257] and by concomitant irradiation [257]. Time to onset of busulfan lung is from a few weeks to 10 years. Administration of other chemotherapy agents increases the risk of developing the condition. Busulfan lung is notable for hugely reactive alveolar cells in the lung and in other epithelia [258], pulmonary fibrosis [259], and, less commonly, a pattern of organizing pneumonia [260], or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [261]. Long-term exposure to busulfan may produce a brownish discoloration of the skin simulating Addison\u2019s disease [256]. Although the incidence of busulfan lung is relatively high, with figures up to 6%, the disease is difficult to predict as pulmonary function of unaffected patients may remain unchanged during treatment [262]. Although reports of pure busulfan lung have decreased in the past years, busulfan pulmonary toxicity continues to afflict patients with hematologic malignancies or breast carcinoma who receive chemotherapy regimens including this drug, although the lung illness in these cases is not coined busulfan lung any longer [257].",

The peculiar feature in a subset of patients with late cyclophosphamide toxicity is a pattern of pleuropulmonary fibroelastosis that involves the upper and lateral aspects of the pleura, which is thickened, in addition to more conventional changes of pulmonary fibrosis of the underlying lung [114, 149, 294, 295]. Progressive narrowing of the anteroposterior aspect of the thorax may develop in children, contributing the restrictive physiology, which is progressive with time [149, 296]. Pneumothorax may complicate this form of late cyclophosphamide pleuropulmonary toxicity, and it is difficult to treat as the underlying fibrotic lung reexpands poorly. Chronic cyclophosphamide pneumonitis is irreversible, even with drug withdrawal and institution of corticosteroid therapy [114].",

Dasatinib may also cause lung injury in the form of pulmonary infiltrates [32]. In 40 patients on dasatinib, 6 had a lymphocyte predominant pleural exudates, and 7 had parenchymal ground-glass or alveolar opacities or septal thickening [32]. Lymphocytes represented up to 92% of the cells in the BAL, and lymphocytes were confirmed in pleural tissue in one case. Upon dasatinib discontinuance (with corticosteroid therapy in one patient), manifestations of the disease abated or resolved in all nine cases. Interestingly, no relapse occurred in three of four rechallenged patients [32], enabling resumption of treatment with this often vital drug. Lymphocyte-rich effusions (bilateral in one case) were also reported in two patients [304]. Chylous fluid was present in one patient. The authors suggested that the effusions were the result of PDGFR inhibition [304].",

Acute interstitial pneumonitis due to fludarabine was first described in 1987 [313]. The disease improved on high-dose steroids, recurred with steroid withdrawal, and abated with further steroid therapy [313]. Fludarabine pneumonitis can occur as early as 7 days into treatment, with an incidence rate of 1\u20138.6% [314]. Patients with a background of chronic lymphatic leukemia and preexisting interstitial pulmonary opacities may be at higher risk of developing pulmonary toxicity [315, 316]. On pathology, cellular interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, granulomas, BOOP, and DAD with reactive type II cell changes have been described [316, 317]. Fludarabine pneumonitis can occasion severe symptoms and can be fatal [318]. In most cases, symptoms abate with drug removal and corticosteroid therapy.

Drugs that cause pulmonary injury such as bleomycin or docetaxel may synergize gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity [319]. The incidence of gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity was 22% when the drug was added to bleomycin, doxorubicine, and vinblastine in a phase I/II trial in end-stage Hodgkin\u2019s disease [75]. Combining gemcitabine and docetaxel induced a 37% incidence rate of pneumonitis [322]. In yet another study where gemcitabine was added to doxorubicin, bleomycin and vinblastine for the treatment of de novo Hodgkin disease, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was 41.7% [74]. In a recent study, gemcitabine given with the anti-CD30 antibody VGN-30 was associated in a 31% rate of pulmonary toxicity [323]. Whether and to what extent pulmonary toxicity in these studies is due to gemcitabine or to the coadministered drugs is unclear. Gemcitabine potentiates the adverse effects of radiation therapy [324].",

Interferon gamma has been used experimentally as a salvage therapy of corticosteroid-resistant pulmonary toxicity syndrome following BCNU-based chemotherapy and met with limited success in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. The respiratory complications from IFN (mostly alpha 2b [332]) may be dose-dependent and occur more commonly following the use of pegylated IFN, and may develop regardless of the underlying disease for which IFN is given. However, most reports are in patients with hepatitis C virus infection [333]. The most distinctive adverse effect of IFN alpha and beta is a picture indistinguishable from naturally occurring sarcoidosis. After a few months into treatment, patients develop de novo sarcoidosis or there is reactivation of previously diagnosed quiescent sarcoidosis. The lung, liver, heart, central nervous system, and skin can be involved [333], and hypercalcemia has been reported [334]. On imaging, IFN-induced sarcoidosis-like disease is in the form of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, ground-glass shadowing, micronodular infiltrates, or thickening along the bronchovascular bundles [335]. Increased lymphocytes, generally of the CD8+ phenotype, are present in the BAL [335, 336], and this is at variance with the findings in naturally occurring sarcoidosis. Eighty-five percent of patients stabilize or improve, 15% develop chronic stable disease, and a third require corticosteroid treatment [333].",

Pneumonitis [17, 350], fluid retention, and pleural effusion [351] have been reported during treatments of chronic myelogenous leukemia with the drug. A series of 27 interstitial pneumonitis cases (with a preponderance of males) was published in 2006 [17]. Onset of the disease was after a median of 49 days into treatment with no evidence that drug dosage was playing a role. Clinical presentation included dyspnea and hypoxemia. Histopathological findings included interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia, and a reactive epithelium [17]. Drug lymphocyte stimulation test was negative in all nine patients so tested [17]. The drug was withdrawn in all patients, and most patients received corticosteroid therapy to alleviate symptoms. The condition resolved in seven patients and improved in 16. In the 11 patients who were rechallenged, the disease relapsed in only 4, an important consideration regarding the management of the native hematologic malignancy. One patient was successfully rechallenged while receiving 60 mg of prednisolone [352]. At least seven cases of imatinib-induced pneumonitis with or without fluid retention and pleural effusion have been reported in the interim of the above report [17]. One case of eosinophilic pneumonia ascribed to this agent is available [353], and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis developed in another patient [354].",

            "text": "In 2000, 123 cases of methotrexate lung in hematology and rheumatology patients were summarized [43]. Methotrexate pneumonitis can develop after treatment of leukemia, solid tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, primary biliary cirrhosis, asthma, or molar or ectopic pregnancy [36]. The majority of patients (62%) are women. Methotrexate pneumonitis develops after doses of the drug ranging from 2.5 to 1,400 mg/week. Duration of treatment was from single exposure to 5 years, although half of the patients developed the disease within the first 32 weeks of treatment [366]. The development of methotrexate pneumonitis is unpredictable. There is no correlation between dose and time to onset, or clinical severity. Fatal methotrexate pneumonitis can occur with the low-dosage regimen of methotrexate used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. All routes of administration including the oral, parenteral, and intrathecal ones expose the patient to the risk. The majority of patients are on the drug at the time of pneumonitis, with rare cases of delayed onset of the condition [367]. Methotrexate lung is annunciated by the insidious onset of a dry cough for days or a few weeks, contrasted with unchanged chest radiograph. Then, the disease accelerates with cough in 81% of the patients, fever in 76%, shortness of breath in 82%, dense ILD on imaging, and hypoxemia. Mild peripheral eosinophilia is present in about 40% of patients [368]. Radiographic studies indicate diffuse symmetrical interstitial lung shadowing, and in severe cases dense bilateral alveolar opacities with air bronchograms and volume loss [369]. HRCT discloses dense, patchy, widespread, or diffuse septal lines, geographic ground-glass or alveolar densities [370]. Pulmonary physiology is restrictive, with a low diffusing capacity and significant hypoxemia. Unusual patterns of methotrexate pulmonary toxicity include a subacute presentation, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute chest pain. The BAL is best done in the ICU where provision is made to correct the hypoxemia that almost invariably occurs with the procedure. The BAL discloses increased cellularity with a percentage of lymphocytes averaging 58% vs. 10% in normals [371]. Interindividual differences in lymphocyte counts and/or CD4+ or CD8+ subtype percentages are likely to be the result of when into the disease the BAL is performed and whether corticosteroids have been given [50]. Rare cases show eosinophilia in the BAL.",

Granulomas in methotrexate pneumonitis are typically small and ill-defined, with sterile necrosis being an unusual feature [43]. In patients with predominantly granulomatous methotrexate lung, the disease is patchy with intervening areas of normal lung tissue or tissue showing mild cellular inflammation [43]. Type II cell hyperplasia is an occasional feature in methotrexate lung. Alveolar edema, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membranes, and DAH are unusual findings that denote severe cases. Rare appearances include a DIP pattern, a sarcoid-like reaction, and acute interstitial pneumonia [43, 115]. Although the differential diagnosis of methotrexate lung is complex, the clinical-pathologic pattern of an acute granulomatous pneumonitis with no evidence of infection and mild blood eosinophilia is distinctive compared to any other chemotherapeutic agent [43].",

The drug is mainly used to treat malignant lymphomas of B cell lineage, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders, bullous pemphigoid, and rheumatoid arthritis. Incidence of pulmonary toxicity is 0.03\u20138% [378]. Most patients were receiving rituximab in association with CHOP, CEOP, or CVP and had increased incidence of pulmonary toxicity compared to the pre-rituximab era [379]. Bitzan et al. reviewed 30 cases of rituximab-associated lung disease. Seventy-one percent of the patients received concomitant chemotherapy. Time to onset from the last rituximab dose was 14 days. Eleven of 31 patients required mechanical ventilatory support, and nine died (29%). High-dose glucocorticoid therapy did not improve survival or prevent the development of severe lung disease or death [380]. Forty-five cases of rituximab-associated pulmonary injury were reviewed [381]. The most common presentation in 37 of the 45 cases was in the form of acute or subacute BOOP and respiratory failure within 2 weeks after the fourth course of treatment, resolving (in most cases with corticosteroid therapy. A CD4 + -predominant lymphocytosis (up to 90% of all cells) was found in the BAL. Five patients developed early acute pneumonitis, DAD, or ARDS within a few hours after the first infusion of the drug, a pattern consistent with acute cell lysis pneumopathy or cytokine release. Two of these five patients died. Three patients developed macronodules of organizing pneumonia, a form of toxicity that responded successfully to corticosteroid therapy. Mortality was 18%. Pulmonary infiltrates relapsed in about 2/3 of the patients rechallenged with the drug. Two cases of DAH have from this agent have also been reported [11].",

Ventilatory support is required is some patients. Incidence of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates is 4\u20136%. On PFTs, there is deterioration of gas exchange and of the diffusing capacity. In several patients, rechallenge with the drug was followed by recurrence of symptoms. Approximately 60 percent of the patients experienced residual chronic respiratory impairment, in the form of restrictive lung function impairment with or without hypoxemia, and residual pulmonary opacities that only respond incompletely to corticosteroid therapy [391].",

            "text": "For those patients who receive in-field radiation therapy to the chest, the clinical imaging picture of radiation pneumonitis includes classic radiation pneumonitis, which typically develops 1\u20132 months after the onset of treatment in the form of a discrete haze, ill-defined patchy opacities, or an area of condensation predominantly in the radiation field. Radiation metrics (area, beam trajectory, fractionation, mean lung dose, and volume of the lung that receives >20 Gy) are used to monitor the risk of radiation pneumonia. A lymphocyte-predominant BAL accompanies these changes, and, interestingly, the lymphocytic reaction also involves the contralateral lung. These changes usually reverse within 6 months, or slowly progress towards a demarcated area of fibrosis and distortion, with volume loss and later bronchiectasis [392, 393]. Late complications of this form of radiation scar are unusual, and include pneumothorax or colonization by Aspergillus sp. Although patients with early radiation pneumonitis usually respond well to the administration of corticosteroids, these drugs are not required in all cases, and the dosage and duration of treatment are guided by the severity of symptoms. In rare instances, infiltrates of radiation pneumonitis extend outside the radiation field to involve the lung diffusely or both lungs bilaterally. This is associated with significant clinical symptoms, and, in some patients, respiratory failure or an ARDS picture develops [394]. Most patients respond satisfactorily to the administration of corticosteroids. Acute diffuse radiation/chemoradiation pneumonitis may develop in stem cell transplant recipients following the administration of a conditioning regimen followed by TBI. Whether or not TBI is given and the amount of radiation (>12 Gy) influence the likelihood of developing diffuse pulmonary toxicity, a detrimental prognostic indicator [392].",

            "text": "Most chronic complications from radiation therapy that are now seen are the result of methods, indications, and equipment used in the past [13]. Radiation therapy is not given any longer to patients who achieve complete response after ABVD, and extended field radiation therapy has been supplanted by newer conformal techniques, which spare more of the normal lung. Due to the anatomical complexity and intricateness of multiple organs in the chest, there are a multitude of early or late complications that may cause severe impairment [13]. Depending on the radiation dose and beam, long-term progressive changes following chest radiation therapy may injure the lung, airways, pleura, heart valves, myocardium, pericardium, coronary arteries, mediastinum, lymphatics, esophagus, and cranial nerves, imparting varied clinical and imaging expressions to late radiation-induced injury [13, 395, 396]. A restrictive lung dysfunction can be found in up to a third of patients who received radiation therapy in childhood or adolescence [397]. A fraction of patients (about 3%) develop progressive restrictive lung dysfunction, impacting the quality of life. Paramediastinal sharply demarcated opacities of fibrosis and architectural distortion are present in the previously irradiated area. These changes are greater in patients previously exposed to bleomycin [204]. Fibrosis localizes in the bilateral apices, and paramediastinal and parahilar areas following mantle irradiation. However, these changes are not found in every patient, and the presence and severity of the fibrosis are influenced by the area and size of the radiation fields, particularly with regard to the volume of the irradiated lung, and on whether or not in-field coverage of the hilum or lung was required. The \u201camount\u201d of chemotherapy, and particularly the dose of bleomycin or other alkylating agents, also may influence the expression of radiation-induced changes in the lung [204]. In severe cases, a distinctive, Y-shaped pattern of fibrotic changes is present on frontal chest films. Severe restriction or encasing of mediastinal structures may ensue. Pleural effusion and chylothorax [13, 398] and the \u201cdropped head syndrome\u201d may be present [13]. Lymphoma survivors must also be evaluated and monitored using auscultation, cardiac ultrasonography, and cardiac stress regarding the frequent development of valvular incompetence/regurgitation, coronary disease, atrioventricular block, or other late cardiac complications of radiation therapy (e.g., heart failure, pericardial thickening/effusion, and pulmonary vein compression), phrenic nerve, or left vocal cord palsy [13, 397, 399, 400].",
