            "text": "An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is considered to be one of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality, estimated to be the fourth to sixth highest cause of death in the United States [8]. Most ADR detection research has been aimed to predict ADRs in pre-marketing phases, using biomedical information sources such as chemical structures, protein targets, and therapeutic indications. Especially, studies using graph-structured data have demonstrated the superiority of modeling biomedical interactions as graphs. Nevertheless, capturing potential ADRs from the entire population in post-marketing phases is also essential to fully establish the ADR profiles [5]. The potential causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug is called a \u2018signal\u2019 when the relation is previously unknown or incompletely documented. Traditional ADR signal detection research in post-marketing phases mainly counts on a spontaneous and voluntary reporting system that collects spontaneous reports of suspected drug-related events, such as the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Center [1, 2, 4]. However, the spontaneous reporting system has inherent limitations such as underreporting [3, 16], selective reporting [4], and the lack of drug usage data. Therefore, recent studies have attempted algorithmic approaches to detect ADR signals on large clinical databases such as electronic health records (EHR) and healthcare claims data [5, 14]. Many of these studies apply basic machine learning techniques such as random forest, support vector machines, and neural networks. However, fewer studies are using graph-based approaches on the clinical databases in the field of post-marketing ADR signal detection. Due to the complex polypharmacy and multiple relations among drugs and diseases, we expect that graph structure can provide insights to potential ADRs, which may not otherwise be apparent using disconnected structures.\n",

Specifically, we use National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC), the 12-year healthcare claims data that covers medical histories for one million population [10]. The constructed graph is a heterogeneous graph with drug and disease nodes, as it is depicted in Fig. 1. The nodes represent the medicine prescription codes and disease diagnosis codes derived from the healthcare claims data. To represent the relations among these codes, we define edge weights using information from the data. For example, l2-distance between two node embeddings, which are learned from the data, is used to define the drug-drug and disease-disease edge weights. Also, the conditional probability computed on the data is used for the drug-disease relationship. As Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have been demonstrated [7, 19] their power to solve many tasks with graph-structured data, showing state-of-the-art performances, we use GNN-based approach for ADR detection. We verify that GNNs can learn node representations that are indicative of various relations between drugs and diseases. Then our model makes a prediction on whether a drug node and a disease node will have an ADR relation based on the learned node representations.",

Category-based node representation is designed to represent the categorical information of medical codes. We utilize the hierarchical structure of categorical codes (i.e. ATC and ICD-10 codes) by adopting the one-hot vector format. Since there are multiple categories for each code, the category-based node representation is shown as a concatenation of one-hot vectors, thus, a multi-hot vector. Finally, the initial node representation of the Drug-disease graph are represented as the concatenation of the proximity-based node embeddings and the category-based node embeddings. Following are the definitions for the drug and disease node representations.",

As a result, clinical experts (M.D.) confirm that there exist pairs that are clearly considered to be real ADRs. The pairs are listed in Table 3.",

This can be explained by the fact that the SIDER database is less comprehensive to cover all the specific symptoms, that can be induced by taking medicine. Especially, cardiac murmur and abnormal reflex are frequent symptoms, but it is reasonable to say that the suggested pairs are ADRs. For example, Dasatinib is used to treat leukemia and can have significant cardiotoxicity, which can lead to cardiac murmurs. Hydroxycarbamide is a cytotoxic drug used for certain types of cancer, and it is known that cytotoxic medications can cause electrolyte imbalance leading to abnormal reflex.",

Severe and transient hypocalcemia is a well-known side-effect of bisphosphonates, which can lead to symptoms of tetany. Alendronic acid is classified as bisphosphonates, and therefore, tetany can be described as ADR of alendronic acid. Ibandronic acid and etidronic acid in the last two rows are also bisphosphonates, and the paired symptoms are relevant to the usage of bisphosphonates. Unspecified edema may signify bone marrow edema caused by bisphosphonate use, and electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to abnormal reflex, can be caused by etidronic acid use. All these explanations show that the ADR pairs we extract are based on various relations among drugs and diseases.\n",

Furthermore, our model even predicts drug-ADR pairs that do not exist in the established ADR database, showing that it is capable of supplementing the ADR database. The explanation by clinical experts verifies that the graph-based method is valid for ADR detection. In this study, we only make inferences within the labeled dataset, yet we plan to make inferences on unlabeled data to discover unknown ADR pairs, which will be a huge breakthrough in ADR detection.",
