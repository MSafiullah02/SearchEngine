This antiviral drug was found to block internalization of virus into the host cell [Skehel et al, 1977; Koff and Knight 1979; Bukrinskaya et al, 19821 and seemed to damage the assembly of virions in infected cells [Hay et al, 19851 . It has been reported also that protection of mice lethally infected with influenza virus could be performed by aprotinin [Zhirnov et al, 1982a , a polypeptide antiproteinase [Trautschold et al, 19671 . This compound was demonstrated to inhibit proteolytic cleavage of virus haemagglutinin [Zhirnov et al, 1982b, 19851 , and thus to prevent activation of progeny virions and to reduce the spread of infection [Zhirnov et al, 1984a, 19851 . Unlike rimantadine [Grunert et al, 19651 , aprotinin has been observed to induce marked protection of animals infected with influenza virus not only when it has been administered early on but also following administration later on in infection [Zhirnov et al, 1982al . It is shown here that these drugs, which affect the different stages of virus replication, are able to induce a synergistic therapeutic effect in animals infected with influenza virus.",

To summarise, higher induction by the virus strain of the host proteinase activity leads to a more intensive virus proteolytic activation, and virus spreading develops in the host organism [for review, see Zhirnov, 19831 . It follows from this supposition that proteinase inhibitors, including aprotinin, may normalize proteolytic balance to limit inflammatory process and development of a syndrome of [Andersen, 1983: Appleyard and Tisdale, 19851 . On the other hand, antiproteinases, such as TPCK, TLCK, PMSF, and aprotinin failed to block penetration of measles virus and coronavirus into the host cells [Appleyard and Tisdale, 1985; Richardson and Choppin, 19831. haemorrage and coagulation defects, and that they may suppress proteolytic activation of virions to reduce virus multicycle replication and spread (see Fig. 3 ). It also follows that rimantadine attacks other targets in virus replication to prevent penetration of infectious virions into the host cell and disturb the assembly of virions. Targeting, for different stages of influenza virus pathogenic pathway, is thought to be the main mechanism of synergistic anti-influenzal therapeutic action of the combined aprotinin-rimantadine treatment. Aprotinin and rimantadine are medicinal compounds. The synergistic antiinfluenzal effect reported here suggests that combined aprotinin-rimantadine antiinfluenza therapy might be used for clinical trails. In man, influenza virus infection is primarily localized in the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it seems expedient to use aerosol inhalations of these compounds. The first clinical observations during an outbreak of influenza have demonstrated the antiviral and therapeutic efficasy of aerosol inhalations of antiproteinases [Zhirnov et al, 1984bl and rimantadine [Hayden et al, 19821 . Based on these findings it seems feasible to design manual inhalers with antiproteinase agents and rimantadine. Such inhalers are thought to make earlier prophylactic and therapeutic applications of both compounds possible, especially during influenza outbreaks and epidemics.",
