Although currently there are no\napproved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections available,\npreclinical data with the nucleotide analog remdesivir (RDV) are promising, and human safety\ndata are available (1). This compound shows a broad\nspectrum of antiviral activities against several RNA viruses (2\u20134), including SARS\u2013CoV and MERS\u2013CoV (5). RDV was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (2). Cell-culture and animal studies revealed potent\nantiviral activities against filoviruses, including the Ebola virus (EBOV) (4). Subsequent studies have shown that RDV is also active\nagainst coronaviruses with divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) (5, 6). However,\nbiochemical data that support these findings and provide a possible mechanism of action are\nnot available.",

Biochemical data suggest that the active complex is\ncomposed of at least three viral nonstructural proteins nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12. The RNA\npolymerase nsp12 alone displays low processivity. Synthesis of longer reaction products\nrequire the additional presence of nsp7 and nsp8. Although a heterotrimer was not stable,\nnsp7 and nsp8 can be linked together to form a complex with nsp12 (15). Here we developed a novel expression system for the MERS\u2013CoV\nRdRp complex and studied the mechanism of action of remdesivir. Co-expression of the MERS\nnsp5 protease with nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 in insect cells yielded a stable complex composed\nof nsp8 and nsp12. We demonstrate that this complex is active on model primer/template\nsubstrates that adequately mimic the elongation state. Most importantly, selectivity\nmeasurements determined here under the inherent limitations of the steady-state conditions\nrevealed that incorporation of the inhibitor is more efficient than its natural counterpart,\nand delayed chain termination is observed at position i + 3.",

Reactions containing the MERS\u2013CoV RdRp complex,\nprimer/template, and various combinations of NTPs were initiated by the addition of\nMg2+ ions. In the presence [\u03b1-32P]GTP alone, the expected\n5-mer product is formed. The addition of specific combinations of NTPs generated defined\nreaction products: [\u03b1-32P]GTP and ATP yielded a 7-mer (Fig. 1D, left side of\nthe gel) or a 6-mer product (Fig.\n1D, right side of the gel), depending on the\ntemplate sequence. Similarly, in the presence of [\u03b1-32P]GTP, ATP, and CTP\n(or UTP), the 4-mer primer is extended to yield an 11- or 7-mer depending on the template\nsequence. The addition of all four NTPs resulted in a 14-mer full-length product.\nReactions with the SNN mutant enzyme did not show RNA product formation.

Hence, we devised two different RNA templates that allow\nmultiple and single incorporations, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2A. These sequences were used to compare the\ninhibitory effects of RDV on EBOV RdRp and MERS RdRp. For EBOV RdRp, we observed delayed\nchain termination at position i + 5 as previously described (Fig. 2B) (8). However, the template that provides a single site of RDV-TP incorporation\nalso shows reductions in full-length RNA synthesis. In contrast, the MERS RdRp complex\nyields the full-length RNA product with both sequences. The inhibition patterns with\nRDV-TP differ markedly from our results with EBOV RdRp. RNA synthesis is arrested at\npositions i + 3 and i + 4 with a template that provides\nmultiple sites of incorporation of the inhibitor, and the full-length product is only seen\nas a faint band. The template that allows only a single incorporation event yields RNA\nsynthesis arrest at position i + 3 and an increased amount of the\nfull-length product. Hence, the mechanism of inhibition is likely delayed chain\ntermination for both EBOV RdRp and MERS RdRp, although the specific patterns show subtle\ndifferences. In the absence of inhibitor, RNA synthesis and full-length product formation\nis generally more efficient with MERS\u2013CoV RdRp. This could also help to explain\nthat a small amount of full-length product is still seen with this enzyme in the presence\nof inhibitor.",

            "text": "Data acquisition and quantification were done as previously reported by us (8, 10). RNA\nsynthesis assay consisted of mixing (final concentrations) Tris-HCl (pH 8, 25\nmm), RNA primer (200 \u03bcm), RNA template (1 \u03bcm),\n[\u03b1-32P]NTP (0.1 \u03bcm), various concentrations and\ncombinations of 100 \u03bcm (or as indicated) NTP and NTP analogs, and\nMERS\u2013CoV RdRp complex (\u223c0.1 \u03bcm) on ice. Reaction mixtures (10\n\u03bcl) were incubated for 10 min at 30 \u00b0C followed by the addition of 5 \u03bcl\nof MgCl2 (2.5 mm). The reactions were stopped after 30 min by the\naddition of 15 \u03bcl of formamide/EDTA (50 mm) mixture and incubated at 95\n\u00b0C for 10 min. 3-\u03bcl reaction samples were subjected to denaturing 8 m\nurea 20% PAGE to resolve products of RNA synthesis followed by signal quantification\n(ImageQuant 5.2, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) through phosphorimaging (Typhoon TRIO\nvariable mode imager; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). For nucleotide incorporation\nexperiments, ATP or the ATP analog inhibitor was added at increasing concentrations, and\nthe reactions were stopped at a fixed time point of 20 min following the addition of\nMg2+. The reaction conditions were chosen such that the formation of the G5\nproduct, i.e. the 4-mer primer extended with [\u03b1-32P]GTP,\nwas linear with respect to time at the 20-min time point. The product fraction was\ndetermined from the total signal in G5 and i6 bands, plotted versus ATP\nor ATP analog substrate concentrations, and fitted to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation\nusing GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) with\nVmax and Km parameters. Our\nassay involves incorporation of [\u03b1-32P]GTP into the primer. With this\napproach it is not possible to quantify the fraction of the extended primer; however, the\nreaction products are clearly defined by the correct incorporation of\n[\u03b1-32P]GTP. Potentially confounding by-products caused by misaligned\nprimers are invisible. In case of IC50 experiments the full template-length\nproduct fractions were plotted versus RDV-TP concentrations and fitted to\na log(inhibitor)\u2013versus\u2013normalized response \u2212\n(variable slope) equation using GraphPad Prism 7.0 to determine the IC50 values\nfor the inhibition of RNA synthesis by RDV-TP. The concentrations of nucleotide substrate\n(0.02, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 \u03bcm) in the competition assays were chosen\naround the Km value for ATP (0.02 \u03bcm; Table 1).",
