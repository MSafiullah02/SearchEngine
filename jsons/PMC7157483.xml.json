            "text": "Cross-species transmission of viruses from animals to human and their subsequent evolution have in the past led to epidemics, some with disastrous results on a global scale. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus and the Spanish flu of 1918 are just a few examples Greger, 2007, Tapper, 2006. Viruses continue to present new threats, a recent example being the ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2014\u20132016, with 28 616 known cases and 11 310 deaths, as of June 2016) and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (56 cases and 25 deaths, as of early June 2018) (World Health, 2015-2018). Another example is the avian influenza, in particular the H5N1 virus which has been circulating since 1997 in parts of Asia and some regions of Africa with 860 confirmed cases of human infection (454 deaths) in the years between 2003 and 2018 (World Health Organization, 2018). This disease in its current state does not readily infect humans, but can spread rapidly amongst domesticated birds with a mortality rate as high as 100% (Alexander, 2000). Human cases have resulted from direct or close contact with infected poultry (domesticated chickens, ducks and turkeys). The spread of avian influenza from an infected person to another has rarely been reported and the transmission has not been observed to continue beyond one person. All influenza viruses, however, have the ability to change and adapt. Past examples, such as the Spanish flu, have shown that this could result with a transmissible virus which can spread easily and directly to humans. Such an outbreak could develop into an epidemic on a global scale, potentially taking millions of lives. A better understanding of the dynamics of how events leading to an epidemic can help to control and eradicate the disease and to prevent an infectious disease from developing into an epidemic.",

Minor mutations may involve small changes to surface glycoproteins, resulting with a strain of the same viral subtype that can deceive the adaptive immune response, and reinfect a previously infected host. This kind of mutation is known as antigenic drift and leads to recurrent, often annual, outbreaks of an influenza subtype. More dramatic mutations leading to new viral subtypes are known as antigenic shifts, which can arise in at least two ways. The first way is known as reassortment in which influenza viruses of two different subtypes infect the same host simultaneously, whereby genetic material could be exchanged to form a new, viable virus. This is a feared possibility regarding individuals infected by both the human and avian forms of influenza, leading to a transmissible form of the disease. The second involves direct or indirect introduction of an avian influenza virus into humans which subsequently adapt to the new host Scholtissek, 1994, Ferguson et al., 2003. The new virus subtype, with no antibodies against it present in the human body, will transmit easily from human to human, as a result, a global pandemic may occur.",

The indirect transmission of the mutated virus into humans via an intermediate host (e.g. pigs) is not considered here, the model developed, however, can be adopted to include an intermediate host without too much difficulty. The relative simplicity of the system we study enables a detailed analysis to be carried out, from which a number of key characteristics of an epidemic following disease mutation can be quantified in terms of the model\u2019s parameters.",

            "text": "Published models of avian flu have focused on the spread of disease between bird populations and farms Boender et al., 2007, Le Menach et al., 2006, Sharke et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2012 and cross-species transmission between bird and human populations Chong et al., 2014, Gumel, 2009, Iwami et al., 2007, Martcheva, 2014. In each of these studies their aim is to understand the dynamics of the disease and the effectiveness of measures to control in both bird and human populations. Each of the bird\u2013human transmission models is extension of the \u201cstandard\u201d SIR compartmental formulation (Susceptibles\u2013Infectives\u2013Removed) for an endemic disease (i.e. natural birth and death processes are considered), whereby mutation to the human\u2013human transmissible form emerges via antigenic shift in human hosts. The mutation events are assumed to have occurred either at a fixed rate Chong et al., 2014, Gumel, 2009, Iwami et al., 2007 or as a spontaneous event at a given time point (Martcheva, 2014). The core of the analysis investigates the stability of equilibria and establishing the basic reproduction numbers of the disease in the populations. In contrast to these studies, we analyse in this paper a model that describes the potential development of an epidemic of human\u2013human transmission form of flu by focusing on the human population only, whereby bird\u2013human transmission only occurs to a sub-population of humans (bird handlers) at a fixed rate (assuming an approximately fixed population of diseased birds). In common with the above mentioned avian flu models, we extend the SIR formulation and assume mutation is via antigenic shift in humans, however, we analyse in much more detail the transient behaviour (e.g. timescales for epidemic outbreak, duration of epidemic) as well as the long-time dynamics. Moreover, a stochastic version of the model is investigated to assess the reliability of the predictions from a continuum model in a range of circumstances. We note that modelling epidemics using SIR based models has had a long history since the seminal work of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927), including applications to influenza, sexually transmitted disease, the \u201cBombay plague\u201d (Murray, 1993) and West Nile virus (Wonham et al., 2004). Amongst the mathematical extensions include more general infection rate kinetics (Korobeinikov and Maini, 2004), terms with time delays Jin and Ma, 2006, Tchuenche et al., 2007, Cooke, 1979, stochasticity Tornatore et al., 2005, Tuckwell and Williams, 2007 and spatial spread (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n et al., 1985). We also note there are a number of epidemic models examining mutations and genetic drift (e.g. Boni et al., 2006, Girvan et al., 2002, Lin et al., 2003, Pease, 1987), many of which are more sophisticated than the proposed model, but at a cost at being more difficult to analyse.",

Whilst the former model is expected to be mainly applicable to large populations, the slow mutation process suggests that stochasticity is important, particularly early in an epidemic. We analyse these models to determine the effects of parameters on a number of features of an epidemic (onset time, epidemic duration etc.), establishing the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. Furthermore, the deterministic model is extended to investigate potential measures in disease control. Though the model provides a general framework for in-host mutation more virulent forms of disease, we use the much feared avian flu scenario as a paradigm.",

In the next section, the mathematical model is derived to describe the spread of a bird\u2013human transmissible virus, which can mutate into a human\u2013human transmissible form. Only a fraction of the population is assumed to be at risk of the bird\u2013human transmissible form, but the whole population is vulnerable to the mutated version. We carry out large-time (Section 3) and asymptotic (Section 4) analysis to obtain predictions, in terms of reduced model solutions, on the possible development of an epidemic. In Section 5 the effects of intervention by means of quarantine and vaccination are investigated. The stochastic version of the model is presented and analysed in Section 6 and we conclude with an overview of the result in Section 7.",

The value of S\u221e, as with the standard SIR model, is dependent on the initial conditions and is discussed further below. Linear stability analysis on this steady-state results with a Jacobian that has a zero eigenvalue, with all others being negative provided that (3.2)S\u221e<1\u03b2,thereby (3.1) is neutrally stable. By analogy to the standard SIR model, this result suggests that the basic reproduction number R0 for this system is given by R0\u2248\u03b2. This is true when the parameters \u03bc and \u03b5 are O(1) constants, whereby, the mutation happens sufficiently fast for the whole population to be vulnerable to the human\u2013human transmissible form of the disease. However, as discussed in Section 4.2, R0 will change as \u03b5\u21920. Nevertheless, the inequality (3.2) suggests that in large time Sn will tend to a population S\u221e satisfying the inequality 0\u2264S\u221e\u2264min(1,1\u2215\u03b2).

So the solution S\u221e of G(S\u221e,\u03a8)=0 increases on increasing \u03a8. Moreover, \u03a8(Sn)\u22650 for any non-negative Sn(t) since the bracketed term in the integral (3.8) has the same sign as 1+\u03b5\u2212\u03bc (neglecting the case when this is zero).

Fig. 2 shows plots of the bounds, given by (3.12), and numerically determined values of R\u221e against \u03b2 and \u03bc. The upper bound appears to provide a very good approximation of R\u221e for all values of \u03b2; this was found to be true for small \u03bc, but as \u03bc approaches O(1), R\u221e tends to the lower bound. The reason for this is discussed in Section 4.2. The functions that determine the upper and lower bounds are independent of \u03bc, hence these values are constant in the right-hand figure. As \u03bc>0 increases, R\u221e tends smoothly from the upper to the lower bound, with the lower bound seeming to be a very good approximation from \u03bc=O(1).",

Much of the singular perturbation analysis for these limits follows exactly the same path as the above and we omit for brevity the details for case (1), and present a partially complete analysis for case (2) in Appendix A. In case (1), the non-mutated form of the disease readily infects the exposed portion of the susceptible population (though not relevant to avian flu, it may be applicable to other diseases). A notable feature for this case is the exposed portion of the population (i.e. the Sb class) is infected rapidly by the non-transmissible form in comparison to disease mutation, the effective population that is vulnerable to the mutated form are those that remain (i.e. the Sn class); consequently, the effective reproduction number for this new limit is R0\u223c\u03b2s0. This value of R0 and that of R0\u223c\u03b2 derived in Section 4.1.1 is bridged by case (2), where in Appendix A it is determined to be (4.21)R0=\u03b2\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2s0)ln\u03b2(1\u2212s0)1\u2212\u03b2s0\u2212\u03bcln(1\u2215\u03b5)\u03bc<(s0\u22121\u22121)\u2215ln(1\u2215\u03b5),\u03b2s0\u03bc\u2265(s0\u22121\u22121)\u2215ln(1\u2215\u03b5),\nin the limit \u03b5\u21920.

The analysis shows that this is due to the timescales and which form of the diseases each of the susceptible classes becomes infected by. For \u03bc=O(1), members of the Sb class are infected more by the bird\u2013human transmissible form, and consequently have all moved to the R class, to leading order, by the time the epidemic of the human\u2013human transmissible form takes hold. For \u03bc\u226a1, nearly the whole population is susceptible at the onset of the epidemic.\u2022There will be a significant time lag from when the bird\u2013human transmissible has reached its apparent peak, before the onset of the epidemic of the human\u2013human transmissible form. This lag phase is lengthened by decreased mutation and infection rates, becoming infinite as R0\u21921. These results are demonstrated in Fig. 6, showing the effect R0=\u03b2 on the evolution of Im (left) and Sn (right).\u2022During the epidemic, the maximum infected fraction and epidemic duration increase with s0 (see Table 1). This indicates the perhaps unintuitive result that if the bird\u2013human transmissible is less infectious (smaller \u03bc) then the epidemic from the human\u2013human transmissible form will be worse.\u2022The leading order system that results during the epidemic timescale, Eqs. (4.15), (4.16), is the classic SIR(Susceptible\u2013Infectious\u2013Removed) model; this is true for \u03b5\u226a1 and \u03bc=O(1) case as well, though S0\u2021 is replaced with Sn0\u2021. The usual discussion of the SIR model involves a finite initial number of infectives, I0>0 say, whilst in contrast the current system involves an infinitesimally small initial state, i.e. I0\u21920+. This means that the extent of the epidemic corresponds to the least severe case of that predicted by the standard SIR model.\u2022The upper and lower bounds derived for R\u221e in Section 3 correspond to Eq. (4.20) for \u03bc\u226a1 and \u03bc=O(1) cases, respectively, as \u03b5\u21920. This explains why the R\u221e is nearly equal to the upper bound solutions in the left of Fig. 2.\n",

On the right of Fig. 10 the profiles of the mutated fraction are all very similar, albeit at different time-points at which they reach their peak. Where Im reaches their peak, the corresponding Ib profile drops down to near zero as shown on the left side of the figure. We note that the deterministic model\u2019s prediction of the rising profile of Ib is in good agreement with each of the stochastic runs, where in the latter stochasticity leads to noise about the steady fraction of Ib\u2248\u03bc(1\u2212s0)\u2215\u03b3=2\u00d710\u22125. The plots reveal that stochasticity makes little difference with regard to the maximum Im and duration of infection, this being verified in the results shown in Table 3. Furthermore, the table shows that total number of individuals in the recovered/removed class as t\u2192\u221e\nis in very good agreement. We note that the standard deviations of the stochastic model are less than 1% of the mean in the first three quantities listed. However, where the deterministic model is a poor predictor of stochastic solutions is with regard to the onset of the epidemic, where for smaller values of N,\u03b5 and \u03bc it is a severe under-estimate. For this reason, we analyse the stochastic model further to determine analytical estimates for the epidemic onset time in Section 6.2. We investigated the distribution of onset times TL for a number of values for N, \u03b5 and \u03bc; two examples of which are presented in Fig. 11, where the probability density functions for TL\nare approximated from 10 000 realisations in each case. Here, the onset times is split into equal time intervals (or bins) and the frequency of elements from the raw data lying in each bin is normalised so that there is unit area under the curve; the time points in the plot are the mid values in the bins. For larger \u03b5 and \u03bc, the shape of the distribution is near bell-shaped, which broadens and skews to the left as \u03b5 and \u03bc gets smaller. For the case of \u03b5=\u03bc=10\u22123 (fig. (a)), the profile happens to fit very well to that of the Gumbel distribution (here, the distribution\u2019s two parameters are formulated using the mean and standard deviation of the data). However, on comparing all of the probability distributions available in the mathematics package MATLAB with all of the results generated from the stochastic simulations, no single distribution fits the data well in all cases (indeed all these distributions poorly fitted that shown in the right plot); hence this was not pursued further. Fig. 11 (b) shows the case \u03b5=\u03bc=10\u22124, where, interestingly, the modal value of TL\u224810 in the plot is much closer to that predicted by the deterministic model.",

Both formulations assume that during the progression of the epidemic when t<TL, the infected populations are negligible in comparison to the uninfected classes, hence Sb+Sn=N is assumed. The first formulation, described in Appendix C.1, assumes that the rise in Ib and Im occur independently and the estimate of E(TL) is made by summing the time for Ib to reach a pseudo-steady state Ib=Ibc=\u03bc(1\u2212s0)N\u2215\u03b3, giving say E(T1) and the time for Im to reach \u03c3N given Ib=Ibc, say E(T2); hence E(TL)\u2248E(T1)+E(T2). This can be calculated easily, but is a flawed estimate since the rising of Ib and Im are not independent. The second formulation considers changes in both Ib and Im leading to a two-variable recurrence relation to obtain E(TL). This formulation, if solved directly, is very computationally intensive, particularly for large N and less small \u03b5 and \u03bc; described in Appendix C.2 is a method to obtain a good estimate of the solution more efficiently.",

This shows the rapid increase in E(TL) as parameters \u03b5=\u03bc decrease. The dotted line shows that the deterministic model is a very poor approximation for small \u03b5=\u03bc, but becomes very good beyond \u03b5=\u03bc\u224810\u22123. Conversely, the first formulation, curve (b), estimates E(TL) well for very small \u03b5=\u03bc, but fails to be a good prediction beyond \u03b5=\u03bc\u22483.10\u22124; this suggests that assuming independence of Ib and Im is reasonable when \u03b5=\u03bc are very small. However, the estimate from the second formulation, curve (a), is in very good agreement across the entire range, suggesting that the constant uninfected population assumption is reasonable. We note, that by increasing N improves the deterministic model\u2019s prediction of E(TL), as expected; for example, using \u03bc=\u03b5=10\u22124 and (currently unrealistic) N=1010, the stochastic simulation mean from a 1000 trials gives E(TL)\u22485.24 is close to the deterministic model\u2019s estimate of TL\u22485.20.",

This scenario may arise in avian flu, in which currently only people working with poultry are likely to catch the disease, but a mutation could lead to a human\u2013human spreading strain, with potentially devastating results. We derived a mathematical model extending an SIR type approach that divides each of the susceptible and infectious classes into two subclasses. The susceptibles were divided into those who are (e.g. poultry farmers) or are not at risk of catching bird\u2013human strain and those who are infected with the bird\u2013human and human\u2013human transmissible strains. We note, the assumed division of susceptibles into two (or more) classes has very wide application, where sub-populations with distinct disease exposure characteristics to the non-mutated form could be based on activity, geography or demography. The model has relatively few parameters and four dimensionless ones (\u03b2,\u03bc,\u03f5 and s0), of these s0 could be obtainable using suitable census data and using ordinary flu for the infection rates we may expect \u03b2 to be in the range 2\u22125 Chowell et al., 2006, Lin et al., 2003.

In particular, we sought to establish the necessary conditions for an epidemic to occur and key characteristics such as the timescale for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. For general parameter values, we derived in Section 3 bounds on the predicted total fraction of the population who will catch the disease. Further progress was made in two biologically feasible asymptotic limits in Section 4 using singular perturbation theory. Here, analytical approximations to the model solutions were made by solving systematically deduced reduced systems for different timescales, making it easier to identify the important processes at various stages of the epidemic and to express key epidemic features in terms of simple formulae (as summarised in Table 1). In particular, it was demonstrated that the naive assertion of the reproduction number R0=\u03b2 (dimensionless) would not be appropriate for small \u03b5 and \u03bc\u223c1\u2215ln(1\u2215\u03b5) or larger (Eq. (4.21)). Furthermore, the analysis highlighted the role of parameters \u03b5 and \u03bc on the logarithmic dependence on the timescale for epidemic onset, TL, whilst other aspects of an epidemic (duration, maximum infectives etc.) are largely governed by an SIR model and parameters \u03b2 and s0. However, it is in the prediction of TL, for very small \u03b5 and \u03bc and insufficiently large populations, where the deterministic model fails, as demonstrated in Section 6 using a stochastic model; the rarity of mutation events combined with failure to pass on the infection result in extended onset times. This highlights the need for caution when using a deterministic model to describe the progress of a disease in \u201clarge populations\u201d, as the presence of small parameters may necessitate the population to be much larger than expected (perhaps beyond that which is applicable) for the model to represent well the mean of a stochastic process. However, in all other key features of an epidemic, the results of the deterministic and stochastic models were in very good agreement.",

The simple formulations resulting from asymptotic analysis made it a relatively simple task to predict the outcome of such measures and, in particular, indicate how intensively the measures need to be applied in order for them to be effective. They target two characteristics of the disease predicted by the model: (1) by reducing the effective basic reproduction number (specifically in the cases of quarantine and pre-infection vaccination programmes) and (2) by exploiting the time lag prior to the epidemic, whereby a significant proportion of the population will be vaccinated before the outbreak. Of course, the situation is more complicated than that assumed in the model, with the existence of many and newly evolving flu virus strains and the constant need to develop new vaccines. Without suitable estimates of all the parameters, it is difficult to assert which programme will be the most effective. However, the analysis confirms what is surely well known, that all measures will help and should be implemented.",

Of course, such modelling simplifications are made at a cost of a number of potentially important details. The model can be refined to consider other phases (e.g. incubation phase), population classes (e.g. bird populations), endemic scenario (population growth and migration), time dependent infectiousness and recovery (e.g. integro- and/or delay-differential equation systems), and spatial effects (either as a continuum or in a patch network). These refinements will doubtless lead to models with better predictive capabilities in more specific scenarios. Nevertheless, the current model serves as a simple approximation to describe the emergence of mutated, spreadable disease, that is simple enough to analyse in some detail and so provide insight into the timing and appropriate use of control measures should the threat of an epidemic becomes imminent; for avian flu, we hope this will never be the case.",
