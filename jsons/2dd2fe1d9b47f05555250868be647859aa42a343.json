Furthermore, the lead surgeon can successfully focus on the referral of patients for local care, using the link with former fellows and colleagues that practice on country sites, promoting scientific and clinical exchange, to reduce the need for traveling and visiting of larger reference centers, thereby decreasing risk of contamination. The importance of the mentor-trainee relationship was highlighted by Schiller resident and their foot and ankle mentor appears to have the greatest impact on pursuing foot and ankle surgery as a career [10] . Accordingly, this interpersonal connection can be used to foster care and trust, maintain patient care and minimize the risk of patient's contamination and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. For longer follow-up consultation, the advent of technologies and telemedicine has made everything easier. At the moment, user-friendly apps, such as \"iMeApp\", and other software allow patients to easily make available relevant clinical information to their care-provider before a formal telemedicine appointment.",

Moreover, politicians should take prompt decisions and doctors should be involved to spread the message, supported by their positive influence on people and patients. Our role as orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons must primarily be to act as an example and respect the rules; after this, it is essential to follow our patients up as far as possible, promoting healthy behavior and developing alternative systems to provide continuous care and minimizing hospital access. Moreover, great attention should be given to creating either a COVID-19-free hospital or a hospital area, to proceed with safe selected elective procedures as well as urgent and traumatic cases.",
