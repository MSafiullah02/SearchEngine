            "text": "The viruses most frequently associated with respiratory tract infections include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and influenza virus [1, 2]. RSV has been considered the most common respiratory virus affecting infants and young children worldwide. In contrast, coronavirus has been a well-known cause of upper respiratory tract infections, occasionally a more severe lower respiratory tract illness in this patient group [2, 3]. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing between respiratory pathogens clinically and by laboratory-based analysis, studies on the impact of respiratory infections are still quite limited. Despite improved sensitivity of diagnostic techniques, the causes of a significant part of lower respiratory tract infections have as yet eluded identification [4]. The development of new diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR has facilitated identification of coronavirus infection in recent years [5]. Hospitalized infants with acute bronchiolitis and pneumonia have previously been shown to harbor coronavirus as one of a minor contributory factor [6].",

Coronaviruses are subdivided into three groups, human corona viruses 229E (hCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43) have been recognized as causes of upper respiratory tract disease including common cold and also are group 1 and 2 coronaviruses, respectively [7]. Recently, another group (hCoV, hCoV-NL63) has been reported in the Netherlands [6]. Based on the structure and function of the polymerase gene, there is a valid region for phylogenetic comparisons as well as for developing a consensus polymerase chain reaction assay applicable to find the differentiation of novel coronaviruses such as SARS [8, 9]. This might prove very useful as these novel coronaviruses have been tentatively identified by electron microscopy in association with a variety of human and animal diseases, although further characterization and definite identification of these agents as coronaviruses has been extremely difficult and insensitive. RT-PCR is currently a rapid and sensitive method for the diagnosis of hCoV [5].",

Thus, hCoVs are very difficult to detect and the prevalence and epidemiological data are scanty, especially in Asian countries. One recent report from Hong Kong showed that hCoV infections were also found in 4.4% (hCoV-NL63 1.5%, hCoV-OC43 0.3%, hCoV-229E 2.6%) of the children studied [14]. For isolation of suspected cases, contact tracing is only available for controlling the infection. A rapid and accurate diagnosis test is very important. Since the antibody response takes (such as SARS coronavirus) [14] 10\u201328 days after onset [19], detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR is likely to be the best option for early detection [6]. In this study we applied molecular biology techniques to identify hCoV in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPs) for the study on the prevalence of molecular characterization and clinical correlation of coronavirus infections in hospitalized infants and young children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI).",

The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using primer MF1 as a sense primer, and again MF3 as an antisense primer for hCoV-OC43 [16]. For a replicase gene, of hCoV-229E, Pcon3 was used as an outer sense primer, Pcon4.2 as an outer antisense primer, Pcon1 as an inner sense primer, and Pcon2.2 as an inner antisense primer base on the sequence accession No. X69721. The details of the primers are shown in table 1. The amplification reaction was performed in a thermocycler (9600 PerkinElmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn., USA) applying the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles each of 1 min at 95\u00b0C for denaturation, 1 min at 60\u00b0C for primer annealing, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C for extension and concluded by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. After electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide on preparation, the expected 217-bp product for hCoV-229E and the 334-bp product for hCoV-OC43 were visualized on a UV transilluminator (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Rad, Calif., USA).

All were subjected to chest radiographs, which yielded abnormal results. Most chest radiographs showed perihilar infiltrates and hyperaeration. Three (33%) had patchy infiltrates simulating bacterial infection, although 5 (55%) had been given antibiotics and all required oxygen supplement for at least 1 day after admission.
