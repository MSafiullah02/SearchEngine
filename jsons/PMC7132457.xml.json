Children are more susceptible to URTIs because their immune system is not fully mature with increased exposure to viral infections and other social and environmental factors [2].",

Recurrent tonsillitis has some sequelae and complications including: severe lower tract infections and the need for surgery with high impact on families' daily life and healthcare costs.

Tonsillectomy is associated with significant risk of primary and secondary hemorrhage, in addition it is painful procedure [7]. Also, tonsillectomy may affect patient's immune system through the significant decrease of interleukin and immunoglobulins levels postoperatively [8]. Recent studies recommend more randomized controlled trials with adequate long-term follow-up to clarify the benefits of tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in patients with recurrent tonsillitis [9]. Drugs such as penicillin and Azithromycin (AZT) are widely used to control recurrent tonsillitis. Sirimanna et al. [10] reported the usefulness of long-acting penicillin in recurrent tonsillitis prevention. However; long-term use of penicillin may result in hypersensitivity reactions, irritative responses, anaphylaxis, severe local pain and gluteal abscesses [11].",

Tonsillectomy morbidity has high impact on the QOL of patients such as socioeconomic factors and increased burden to parents from the suffering of the child [18].

It is widely distributed in the whole body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and thus serum delivery to infected tissue is further enhanced by inflammatory processes [22]. AZT used for rheumatic fever prevention for a long time before. In our study; we adopted a new regimen for prevention of recurrent tonsillitis in pediatrics; patients received (60 mg/kg) prophylactic dose of AZT divided on 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Patients received AZT alone had significant less tonsillitis attacks and less severe symptoms than patients who didn't receive any prophylaxis during the same period of the study. El Hennawi et al. [18] in their study concluded that AZT is effective in prophylaxis against recurrent tonsillitis with a great benefit for better QOL compared to patients who had tonsillectomy, however; they used the prophylactic regimen of rheumatic fever prevention (once weekly AZT) [23] and they didn't include a control group in their study. Casey and Pichichero [24] reported that AZT treatment for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children and adults is more effective than other treatment regimens in providing clinical cure of tonsillopharyngitis. Snider et al. [25] demonstrated AZT efficacy as a prophylaxis in decreasing streptococcal infections and rheumatic activity.",

Gopal et al. [13] reported that 15.4% of their patients with established rheumatic heart disease had recurrent tonsillitis with once weekly AZT dose. In our study; patients still had tonsillitis attacks with AZT use. Why AZT failed to prevent tonsillitis completely is not very clear. One possibility is that drug dosage was too widely spaced. Though AZT has a long half-life, drug concentration might not have been adequate. AZT when administered at 60 mg/kg per course (i.e. 20 mg/kg for 3 days, 12 mg/kg for 5 days or 10 mg/kg for 6 days) in children was superior to the 10-day course of penicillin, however; 3-days AZT regimen was inferior to 5 and 6-day regimens, also 30 mg/kg per course was inferior to the 10-day courses of penicillin [24]. AZT treatment may be required in higher doses and for longer duration to be effective in recurrent tonsillitis prevention, so we used 60 mg/kg prophylactic dose divided on 6-days.",

AZT inhibits growth of alpha streptococci that are normal defenders of pharyngeal mucosa against pathogens at lower MIC [27]. Intracellular accumulation of macrolides have been shown in leucocytes but not in epithelial cells, which are probably the principal cells targeted by GABHS. In leucocytes; AZT accumulates predominantly in lysosomes, whereas intracellular GABHS is found in phagosomes and cytosol [28]. In a recent study we reported that adult patients with recurrent tonsillitis may have higher incidence of humoral antibody deficiency compared to their age and sex-matched controls [29].

In this study; patients with combined AZT plus Echinacea had significant better results compared to patients with AZT alone. This effect of Echinacea can be attributed to several major constituents of Echinacea identified and reported to be biologically active: Caffeic acid derivatives thought to contribute to the claimed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Echinacea, Alkamides thought to have stimulatory effects on the cells of the immune system and Polysaccharides reported to act on the immune system to boost its effects. The active constituents of Echinacea may strengthen the immune response by interacting with various cells of the specific and non-specific immune system and through activation of macrophages, natural killer cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [31]. On the basis of this limited information, we suggest the possible value of Echinacea added to documented value of AZT in preventing tonsillitis in children.",

Echinacea also appears to be well tolerated; few patients in this study had mild GIT symptoms and loose stool. It has been estimated that 1\u20134% of the general population uses Echinacea in a given year with no deaths and few significant adverse reactions have been reported [35]. Investigations into the toxic effects of Echinacea have failed to find a lethal dose. Those with a known allergy to the Asteraceae (daisy) family should avoid Echinacea as few cases of Echinacea induced anaphylaxis, asthma attack; urticaria and contact dermatitis have been reported. Echinacea can interfere with drugs metabolized by an enzyme family known as the cytochrome p450 system and thus prolong their action [36]. When AZT was combined to Echinacea in this study; no interactions reported and efficacy of both drugs were maintained. The development of resistant bacteria with prolonged antibiotic use is well established. Xavier et al. [37] studied the Long-term AZT therapy in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and repeated exacerbations, they reported that long-term intermittent AZT therapy, administered three times a week at a dosage of 500 mg, is well tolerated and associated with significant reductions in acute exacerbations of COPD, number of hospitalizations and days of hospital stay with no development of resistant bacteria.",

Limitations of the study; that there is no data about consequences of discontinuation or continuation of prophylactic courses. Patients with GABHS tonsillopharyngitis experience clinical improvement over time with or without antibiotic therapy. Therefore, measurement of clinical response during treatment is largely meaningless in antibiotic trials. After completion of therapy, some patients experience relapse or recurrence with symptoms and signs of tonsillopharyngitis and with recovery of GABHS on culture of a throat swab sample [24,38]. However; with 60-mg/kg AZT dose, clinical cure and bacterial eradication rates in children compared with 10-day penicillin regimen were superior after discontinuation of AZT courses [24]. The study opens a new era for more research to illustrate possible consequences of more prolonged therapy, infectious course once prophylaxis is discontinued, the possible long lasting benefits and if multiple prophylactic courses need to administered. The main strengths of this study; that it is a prospective study with a control group and there is a difference in the clinical characteristics of those used the prophylactic regimen.",
