            "text": "Commercial airplanes cruise at a typical altitude of 11,000 m where the outside temperature is about \u221255 \u00b0C (\u221267 \u00b0F), the atmospheric pressure is only about one-fifth of that at the sea level and the air is nearly dry [1]. Under such an extreme ambient environment, human beings cannot survive without protection of an environmental control system (ECS). As a part of the ECS, an air distribution system plays roles including distributing air appropriately, cleaning up contaminated air, and minimizing cross airborne disease transmission, towards to creating a comfortable, healthy and safe cabin environment for passengers and crews. However, current widely-used mixing air distribution systems promote air mixing by supplying high-momentum air at the ceiling level and exhausting contaminated air at the deck level. The extensive air mixing is supposed to dilute occupant-generated pollutants, but may also impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission because of easy access of the exhaled pollutants released by some infected passengers in the mixing context. The outbreaks of airborne communicable diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [2], the later on possible multi-drug resistant tuberculosis transmission [3], and the recent pandemic outbreak of the influenza A (H1N1) [4], etc., confirm such risks are not hypothetical but may come to reality. A new air distribution system that can reduce air mixing on airplanes is extremely necessary.",

            "text": "In addition, significant attention should be paid to the numerous long complaints about cabin air quality and thermal comfort [5]. Since the current mixing air distribution system mixes the cabin air very well, temperature inside is highly uniform, hence it should not be the major reason leading to thermal discomfort. The mostly criticized in aircraft cabin is air dryness, which is known to be responsible for headache, tiredness, eye irritation, nasal allergy and other non-specific syndrome symptoms [6], [7]. During flight, the relative humidity of cabin air ranges averagely from 10 to 20%, as similar to typical indoor levels during wintertime [8]. The intercontinental flights may be even dryer, where measurements show 6\u20138% of relative humidity may last for long periods [9]. Low humidity in cabins is attributed to the frequent renewal (20-30 ACH, air change per hour) of cabin air with the outside air that is substantially dry during cruise. Such large air change rate is to dilute internally generated pollutants and also to maintain thermal comfort, though current cabin air quality is still being criticized. The other major reason without humidifying cabin air is to avoid moisture condensation on cabin walls which typically include three layers, i.e., from the outside to the inside the fuselage, insulation panel and lining. The cabin walls experience large temperature difference because of low temperature of aircraft shell at cruising. In addition, low humidity is thought to be helpful for inhibiting fungal and bacterial growth. Therefore, until a new air distribution system has been proposed that can prevent moisture condensation, and at the same time a method has been found to better remove the internal pollutants but without sacrificing thermal comfort so that the air change rate can be lowered, the air dryness and air quality problem in commercial cabins may not be well resolved.",

            "text": "Fortunately, concepts of new air distribution systems for aircraft cabins have been emerged, such as an under-floor displacement air distribution system and a personalized air distribution system. A typical under-floor displacement system supplies conditioned air from the low level at a low velocity and small temperature difference and extracts air at the ceiling level. The personalized air distribution system supplies conditioned air directly to the breathing region of occupants. Zhang and Chen [10] proposed the under-floor air distribution system with perforated-aisle air supply, and the personalized air system by supplying air from a seatback-embedded diffuser in front of a passenger in wide-body aircraft cabins, where both systems were found being capable of providing much better air quality than the current mixing air system. Schmidt et al. [11] applies computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the under-floor air distribution system for a single-aisle aircraft cabin and pointed out it may have draught risks for inside passengers. Again, with CFD Gao and Niu [12] investigated a personalized air system by supplying air through a flexible nozzle just beneath the nose and mouth of a passenger and claimed 60% of the pollutants can be shielded up from inhalation. Similarly, Jacobs and de Gids [13] proposed to supply conditioned outside air via the headrest of the seat, where each passenger can individually control their preferred condition. In addition, Gao and Niu [14] further explored humidifying the personalized supply air to relative humidity of 40\u201350%, but results show only the facial region may have higher moisture content whereas the whole cabin is still maintained very dry. It should be noted that a personalized air distribution system usually requires a mixing or displacement air distribution system as a background system, and moreover our preliminary survey shows not all passengers accept such system mainly due to draught complain, even though some of current airplanes are equipped with personal overhead gaspers.",

A personalized air distribution system supplying air at high velocity may impose draught risk during cruise, which prevents it from being widely accepted. This investigation therefore proposes a new under-aisle air distribution system, by supplying air both from under-aisles and from the two cabin sides below the stowage bins, and thus to enhance moisture content level and improve air distribution efficiency. Performance of the new system in terms of humidity distribution, moisture condensation risk on cabin linings, cabin air quality and thermal comfort are thoroughly evaluated.",

Fig. 1(b) shows the schematics of the system from the sectional view. The air channel is designed to run the length of the aircraft, which is actually a curved air passage formed by the cabin insulation panel and the interior lining with warm air running upward after entering from the underdeck. Such design is in purpose of directly supplying conditioned, outside dry air to the upper region of the cabin, as well as warming the cabin interior linings to avoid possible moisture condensation on them, due to relatively low temperature of the airplane fuselage at cruising. Simultaneously, the other part of outside air mixed together with the recirculated air after humidification is supplied through both perforated under aisles (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). Such under-aisle air supply is to ensure thermally comfortable cabin environment and also to elevate the cabin humidity level. Finally, the contaminated air is extracted through the both ceiling exhausts.",

Each passenger is provided 10 l/s of conditioned air, in which 5 l/s is from the outside. A passenger is assumed to generate 0.005 l/s of CO2 and 0.05 kg/h of moisture through respiration. Since in the new system, both channel inlets are only supplied with fully outside air, the supply CO2 concentration is assumed to be 350 ppm without moisture. The aisle inlets supply the mixture of the outside air (3.572 l/s per person) with the recirculated air (5 l/s per person), so CO2 concentration is around 933 ppm and has been humidified into 25% relative humidity (at the saturation temperature of 22 \u00b0C). The mixing system supplies the mixed air directly and therefore the supply CO2 concentration is around 850 ppm. Because the mixing system mixes the inside air very well, air supply temperature should be lower than the under-aisle system to ensure thermal comfort. This investigation does not consider heat dissipation from electronics devices and other heat sources. Moisture content in the mixing air supply is only from air recirculation generated by inside passengers, where the corresponding relative humidity is around 6%.",

This investigation has thus used the finite volume method. The finite volume method divides the domain into many CFD cells, and then integrates the governing equations over all CFD cells (control volumes). The integral equations are then discretized with a variety of finite-difference-type approximation converting the integral equations into a system of algebraic equations. As for boundary cells, the standard wall function method is used to simplify the solution. Finally, these algebraic equations are solved with suitable solvers via the SIMPLE method.",

Generally, as shown in Fig. 5 the mixing system holds uniform relative humidity of around 10%, which falls within the range of the measured values on airplanes [9]. Such low level of humidity may lead to discomfort complain. However in the new system, after humidification the humidity level is much elevated reaching 20% on average. In the aisle along P3, relative humidity is slightly higher because the dry bulb temperature of air is lower in the aisle and thus a little smaller for the saturation pressure.

The region below the seats generally holds relative humidity of 25% because humid air is supplied from the both under-aisles. Above the passenger thighs, relative humidity reduces due to increasing air temperature with height in the displacement ventilation system, and thus elevating the saturated water pressure. Above the heads, because of respiration and the associated moisture generation, relative humidity increases. By observing the moisture content along the interior surfaces, none of locations reach saturation, so there should be no risk of moisture condensation on cabin linings. The highest relative humidity (less than 50%) is on the cabin ceiling as the moisture rises with air streams to the ceiling. The dry air supplied from the both channel inlets also helps reduce the moisture condensation as shown in Fig. 6(a). Note at the both sides of the cabin and even on the windows that are usually at low temperature, the air is far from reaching saturation. This is in benefit of the elevated temperature on the airplane interior linings due to warm air running through both channel passages as that shown in Fig. 1(b).",

The moisture distribution in the mixing air system is very uniform and the whole cabin is maintained very dry. However, against the current air system, the boost of relative humidity in the under-aisle air system is around 10%. Nagda and Hodgson [7] strongly recommend to increase 5\u201310% of air humidity on airplanes to alleviate the dryness related symptoms, and claim such enhancement of humidity is unlikely to induce microbial growth because there is no moisture condensation in the cabin interior. On the other hand, by calculating the moisture balance according to the design parameters provided from Table 1, the water consumption rate used for humidification is about 0.05 kg/h per person, which should be affordable by the airliners. For example, for a commercial airplane carrying 300 passengers/crews for an 8-hour flight, an extra weight of 120 kg water is needed. The water load corresponds to one additional passenger weight (60 kg) since the water is continuously consumed during the flight. This research therefore concludes the humidification of aircraft cabins with the new under-aisle system is feasible.",

The CO2 concentration in the inhaling regions (Z\n = 1.1 m) for the new system is around 930 ppm, which is much lower than the mixing system that reaches around 1500 ppm. The inhaled concentration in the new system is close to that at the under-aisle air supply, indicating that cross air motion among passengers is very weak, so that the exhaled CO2 from one passenger is not transported to the inhalation region of the other passengers. The concentration values for the four passengers in either respective system are more or less the same. Even for P3 in the aisle, the inhaled CO2 at Z\n = 1.7 m in the under-aisle system is around 1200 ppm, whereas the mixing system approaches 1600 ppm. So the under-aisle system still can maintain good air quality for the crew members who occasionally walk around in the aisles.

This is because the driving force for air motion in the under-aisle air system is buoyancy generated by heat sources. Velocity increases slightly with height until Z\n = 1.3 m on P1, P2, P4 and P5, due to the continuous heating of the surround air by warm human bodies. In the aisle, air motion is even weaker since there is no heat source. However, air motion in the mixing system is much stronger, especially near the ceiling and deck level. As P5 is in the middle of the cabin, which falls in the air recirculation zone, the air motion is not so evident. The high velocity on P1 and the associated turbulence (with intensity of around 9%) at the head level may impose draught risk for the passenger seated near the window. More detailed analysis of the draught risk is in the latter part.",

Since these vertical poles are very close to the passengers (in front of the passengers with a distance of 5 cm), temperature profiles between the two systems are similar with the dominant impact of metabolic heat dissipation. Combined with velocity distribution in Fig. 11, the draught risk for the passenger seated near the window in the mixing system both in the head and ankle level is very high. This was also illustrated in the distribution of percentage of dissatisfied (PD) resulted from draught as shown in Fig. 13\n(a), where the PD reaches around 30% at the head level and around 20% at the ankle level. The PD was calculated using the formulas recommended by the ASHRAE Fundamentals [19]. It may also have small draught risk on P2, P3 and P5 at the ankle level. However, in the under-aisle system, due to very weak air motion and also very low level of turbulence (generally less than 6%) inside the cabin, the draught risk is very minimal as can be observed in Fig. 13(b), though slightly cool air (22 \u00b0C) is supplied through both under aisles. This analysis therefore concludes there is no draught risk in the new under-aisle air distribution system.",

More research efforts, such as on the integration of the new system with aircraft structure and payload as well as the related economic analysis, are extremely required. With respect to the cabin wall, the insulation panel and the fuselage hold lower temperature than the lining during cruise, which may impose greater risk of moisture condensation. The study of condensation within the cabin wall itself is out of the scope of this paper. The modeling of flow and heat transfer in the channel passages also awaits more exploration.",

CFD was applied to investigate the performance of the new system after successfully validating it in a workshop environment with under-floor displacement ventilation. The new system was found being capable of boosting the relative humidity from 10% to 20% and can lessen the inhaled CO2 concentration by 30% as compared with the current mixing air system. There should be no condensation on cabin interior linings because of the elevation of cabin side temperature with warm air running through the channel passage, and the dry air supplied from the both channels also helps prevent condensation. The draught risks are minimal on benefit of conditioned air supply from both under aisles and weak air motion created inside the cabin. The water consumption in air humidification is only around 0.05 kg/h per person, which should be affordable for airliners. Therefore, with comprehensively good performance based on this analysis, the new under-aisle air system is recommended for possible use on future airplanes.",
