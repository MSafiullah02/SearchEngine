Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent chronic lung disease in older subjects and is currently the leading cause of death worldwide [19, 20] . The most common cause of COPD is chronic cigarette smoking. The inflammatory response to cigarette smoke results in an excessive release of chemokines and cytokines with a subsequent high influx of immune cells [20] . Because smoking has also been reported to increase susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection [18] , we aimed to investigate the expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, in a large well-phenotyped cohort of smokers, with and without airflow limitation, in comparison to age-matched individuals that never smoked (never-smokers).",

The intensity of brown staining we wished to score was selected by means of selecting specific hue, lightness, and saturation values. The hue, saturation, and lightness values were identical for all images, therefore restricting our scoring to a specific signal. In every image the alveolar tissue was selected and the DPP4-positive signal was calculated only within the alveolar tissue and normalized to the area of alveolar tissue present in each image. The final score of each patient was the average ratio of DPP4-positive signal of the 15 images. In the airway epithelium, the amount of DPP4 signal was normalized to the length of the basement membrane (Pbm). The final score of each patient was the average DPP4 staining in all airways present in all tissue blocks available of that patient. The number of airways per patient was between 3 and 20. In this study we used resection lung tissue of 90 patients who underwent lobectomia/ pneumectomia due to lung cancer, explant lung tissue of 27 end-stage COPD patients and bronchial biopsy tissue of 37 patients.",

Future studies are needed to assess whether DPP4 upregulation is specific for the alveolar epithelial cells or also occurs in the upper respiratory tract epithelium.

These data suggest a possible role of DPP4 in COPD pathogenesis. DPP4 is an exopeptidase responsible for cleaving chemokines and this alters the biological function. Moreover, DPP4 is able to activate T cells and induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which later could affect the development of COPD [20, [31] [32] [33] . Furthermore, DPP4 is also capable of influencing migration of immune cells by activating or deactivating chemokines in an inflammatory or tumor environment [10, 11] . Interestingly, soluble DPP4 in the serum of COPD patients has been reported to be significantly lower compared to that of non-COPD controls [34, 35] . It remains possible that in COPD patients, DPP4 concentration is low in the serum and high in the lungs to facilitate migration of certain immune cells into or out of the lungs.",
