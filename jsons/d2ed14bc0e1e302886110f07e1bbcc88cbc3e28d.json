Optimised recursive binary splitting: A recent variation of binary splitting suggested by Cheng et al.; if at a given level of the hierarchy only one pool tests positive, identification of a particular case continues via binary search, then deletes the case from the pool and continues with the procedure with the remaining subjects in the unified pool. 13 We improved the method choosing optimal initial pool sizes based on the infection rate.

We found that the performance of all tested methods strongly depends on the input parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. This includes the size and infection rate of a population, but also the test characteristics (esp. sensitivity). To enable the reader to find the best possible strategy for their specific needs, the models we developed can be fully customised and run via https://covid19.enfunction.com. Figure 3a compares the effectiveness in terms of ICPT of all methods for different infection rates under the assumptions shown in the methods section. Hereby, the Sobel-R1 approach is the optimal method and provides a theoretical upper bound for the achievable ICPT. However, this method is restricted in its practical applicability (see below). For an infection rate of 1%, the hierarchical approaches such as binary and recursive binary splitting show almost an eight and ten fold ICPT increase compared to the current status quo of individual testing, enabling the testing of large patient groups with a single test. Disregarding Sobel-R1, we obtain the following results: for infection rates up to 6%, recursive binary splitting is the optimal method; up to 2\u00b75%, the next best option is binary splitting, between 2\u00b75% and 6%, the next best method is the matrix-based Purim method. For infection rates between 6% and 12% Purim is the optimal method. For infection rates of 12% and higher, 2-level pooling with optimised pool sizes yields the highest ICPT. Of note, the current standard approach of individual testing is not the best choice in any of the modelled scenarios.",

We assume that as of early April ir = 1% of the population is infected. Figure 3b shows the overall time required to test the whole population in each of the five countries. Even in Germany, which has the highest relative testing capacity per day of these five countries, it would take 675 days with the current screening approach (individual testing) to test every individual; the US on the other hand would require 2,244 days. For the US, binary splitting reduces the time required to 285 days (about 9\u00b75 months), and the optimised recursive binary splitting to 232 days. If only one tenth of the population needs to undergo screening -e.g. when prioritising frontline medical staff and public workersthis would mean such a campaign could be completed with binary splitting in about 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany. When the infection rates are considerably lower, or when employing the optimal, yet logistically more challenging pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. With Sobel-R1, the same screening campaign could be completed in 21 days in the US, 52 in the UK, 18 in Singapore, 12 in Italy and 7 in Germany. As a case study, we conducted a comparison using the six approaches for three different infection rates for the US (see Table 2 ).",

Figure 3c shows that the (compounded) expected rate of identified cases (true positives) therefore drops by between 1% and 5% in total. In contrast, the likelihood of incorrectly classifying a subject as infected is reduced from 1% to almost 0% (Figure 3d ). This reduced number of false positives has significant economical and health system consequences, as it equates to ca. 1,000 people who would otherwise have been erroneously quarantined in a population of 100,000. At the same time, binary and recursive binary splitting correctly identify up to ten times more cases per test compared to the currently employed individual testing.

Thus, if a sample contains no viral material, then any method will fail, whether individual or pooled. If a sample, however, contains viral material, pooling -which happens after sample taking -can be conducted and is advisable as discussed in this paper.

Given the nature of the work, the study was exempted from ethics approval. With increasing infection rate, the optimal pool size decreases -with the exception of the Sobel-R1 method -until they approach pool-size 1. Parameters: sensitivity p = 0\u00b799, false positive rate q = 0\u00b701, population 50, 000, test duration 5h, averaged over 10 runs The following Figures S1 and S2 complement our study with plots for a decreased test sensitivity of p = 0\u00b775. Figure S1 . The best pool-size (lowest total time) depends on the infection rate, here for ir=1%, 10%, 20%. Parameters: sensitivity p = 0\u00b775, false positive rate q = 0\u00b701, population 50, 000, test duration 5h, averaged over 10 runs Figure S2 . Screening the whole population. Parameters: sensitivity p = 0\u00b775, false positive rate q = 0\u00b701, test duration 5h, averaged over 10 runs. Optimal (max.) pool-size each (c.f. (2)); for ir=1% as in (S2b)-(S2d) we obtain individual testing: 1; 2-level pooling: 12; binary splitting: 32; recursive binary splitting: 32; Purim: 31, Sobel-R1: 32",
