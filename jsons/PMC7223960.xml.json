The case involved the resuscitation of a 23-week 615 g infant over parental objections. It took years to resolve the case in the legal system. Nearly two decades later, we might inquire whether neonatologists and other critical care practitioners have greater comfort in dealing with the issue of parental objection?",

Left unresolved in physician\u2013parent conflicts are such issues as who decides and on what standard? Societal norms over the past half a century on who is to make treatment decisions, and on what standard, have shifted [3]. It is now agreed within the bioethical and medical communities in the United States that where the risk of mortality is significant and the prospect of benefit to an infant is suffused in ambiguity and uncertainty, the decision on whether or not to initiate treatment belongs to the parents. That position is best summarized in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines on \u201cNonintervention or Withdrawal of Intensive Care for High Risk Newborns,\u201d published in 2007 and reaffirmed in 2015. We find the AAP\u2019s position spelled out in three brief statements:When early death is very likely and survival would be accompanied by high risk of unacceptably severe morbidity, intensive care is not indicated.When survival is likely and risk of unacceptably severe morbidity is low, intensive care is indicated.There may be cases that fall [outside] these first two categories\u2026parental desires should determine the treatment approach [4].",

Paul Helft et al.\u2019 article on \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Futility Movement\u201d [6] established that for nearly a decade in the 1980s and 1990s the concept of \u201cmedical futility\u201d was an important aspect in the resolution of physician\u2013family conflicts. Its significance faded when it became clear that there was no agreement in the medical community or society in general on the meaning of the term. The focus shifted to the importance of so-called \u201cfamily autonomy.\u201d The prolonged debate on autonomy was first raised in a 1914 opinion by Justice Benjamin Cardozo of the New York Court of Appeals in Schloendorff v. Society of the New York Hospital [7]. In that case, the state\u2019s court of final jurisdiction ruled that the term \u201cautonomy\u201d should be confined to the value choices of a competent adult patient. Subsequently, New York\u2019s highest court recognized the validity of proxy assessment for the nondecisionally capable patient\u2019s wishes as well as the known values of the once competent adult [8]. \u201cBest interest\u201d of the patient, not the determination of a family\u2019s values, emerged as the standard for minors and those who never possessed decision-making capacity. That standard is articulated in the AAP\u2019s 2007 guidelines on decision-making for newborns, as well as for infants and children [9].",

Some at Maine Medical Center objected. They brought suit in Maine Superior Court. There Judge David Roberts began his analysis of the case by stating \u201cWhile there may be some doubt about the rights of the unborn child, once born the most basic right enjoyed by every human being is the right to life itself.\u201d Judge Roberts ruled that if a patient has medical needs and a medically feasible response is available that intervention must be utilized regardless of the patient\u2019s future quality of life.

In a study recently published in this journal, parents of NICU patients were surveyed on their decision-making as well as their regret at the decisions that were made during their child\u2019s NICU stay [23]. The vast majority of parents preferred active or shared decision-making. They wanted to be involved in critical decisions. Most importantly, being involved was associated with less parental regret.",

Clinicians do not want to have to get into the weeds for everything. A recent study refutes this concern and does not show parents want to undermine a physician\u2019s professional expertise [24]. In this study of 136 NICU parents, parents reported preferences to defer to caregivers for decisions that were technical in nature, that had high potential for benefit, that required medical expertise or where urgent. Parents, however, wanted to be involved when \u201cbig picture\u201d goals or when significant risks were at stake. They believe their values and choices should be seriously considered in these matters and gives providers clear guidance on what is the ideal scope of shared decision-making.",

The investigators highlight how different perspectives on best interests could prevail based on the unequal power and authority of physicians, clinical uncertainty, and the complexity of balancing child and family interests [25]. Given the subjective nature of quality of life assessments, physicians should be clear about who is establishing the goals for the child. They should also reflect on their own potential biases and values. Regardless of the physician\u2019s certainty regarding outcome, physicians should offer noncoercive recommendations that are informed by the patient\u2019s and families\u2019 values and that incorporate the interests of the parents, siblings, and family as a whole.",

Listening to the concerns of the family about the \u201cbig picture\u201d issues is the key to framing shared decision-making. Such a process takes time and empathy on the part of providers. In an earlier article, we provided a case of an experienced neonatologist who successfully utilized shared decision-making to resolve a potential conflict between the NICU staff and the family [26]. He began by acknowledging the father of a NICU patient was confronted with a nearly unimaginable scenario\u2014his wife, who was pregnant with twins, had undergone an emergency C-Section after one twin\u2019s heart rate was no longer detectable. The father, who just lost one daughter and whose wife and second daughter were critically ill, was understandably overwhelmed. This was not an ideal time to ask him to make an important medical decision. Rather what he needed was empathy and above all time to adjust to the new situation. Given the opportunity of support, time and the opportunity of discussion with the attending physician and NICU staff, the father noted that despite this being a much-desired pregnancy neither he nor his wife would want to impose a life of unremitting suffering on their child, or worse, a life without consciousness. The decision to limit further aggressive measures for his daughter became the shared choice of the physician and the parents. Here modern medicine was adhering to the wisdom not to attempt medical interventions on a patient \u201covermastered by disease\u201d [27].",

Multiple family conferences including a neonatologist, a geneticist, a bioethicist, a social worker, and an interpreter allowed the parents to understand the genetic implications and the staff to understand the family\u2019s values. Although initially there was an \u201cethos of mistrust,\u201d after much discussion, the parents eventually proposed a pathway acceptable to them and to the clinicians. The NICU team supported the parents\u2019 decision to omit aggressive inpatient medical interventions for their seriously compromised infant and the parents\u2019 decision to have the baby go home.
