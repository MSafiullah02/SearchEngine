            "text": "The sperm of the mussel Mytilus had hydrolytic activities against substrates for aminopeptidase. Acrosome reaction (AR) was suppressed in the presence of aminopeptidase substrate, Phe-4methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA), and an aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin. Treatment of sperm with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) released aminopeptidase activity from sperm and suppressed AR. These results suggest that the enzyme is located on the sperm surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor and is involved in the AR. Immunoblot analysis showed that tyrosine residues of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins were phosphorylated during induction of the AR. The 40 kDa protein was also recognized by anti-c-Src antibody by immunoblotting. The tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was inhibited when sperm were inseminated in the presence of Phe-MCA, and by PI-PLC treatment. Treatment of sperm with tyrosine kinase activator, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, induced AR, and its inhibitor, genistein, suppressed AR. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins, induced by the interaction of GPIanchored aminopeptidase with oocyte surface, triggers AR in Mytilus sperm.

Proteins linked to the cell surface via a GPI-anchor are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including T-cell activation, transduction of extracellular stimuli, hydrolysis of extracellular matrix proteins, cell-cell adhesion, and fertilization (Brown and London, 1998; Kasahara and Sanai, 2000; Simons and Toomre, 2000; Cherr et al., 2001) . In mammalian sperm, GPI-anchored hyaluronidase (also known as PH-20) on the sperm surface appears to function as a receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA)-induced cell signaling, in addition to being a hyaluronidase itself (Cherr et al., 2001) . It has also been demonstrated that the sea urchin sperm receptor for the egg ligand was found in detergent insoluble glycolipid fraction, which had at least four proteins involved in signal transduction, including a 63 kDa GPI-anchored protein (Ohta et al., 2000) .",

In the marine bivalves, only the morphology of the AR has been studied (Longo, 1983) , and the chemical nature of complementary recognition sites is poorly understood. In previous studies in the mussel Mytilus edulis, we have demonstrated that aminopeptidase-like protease released from oocytes at fertilization affects the oocyte surface and consequently suppresses AR of supernumerary sperm on the fertilized oocytes, resulting in establishment of polyspermy block (Togo et al., 1995; Togo and Morisawa, 1997) . Our studies suggest that the molecules on the oocyte surface, which are recognized by aminopeptidase, are involved in induction of AR. We also have evidence from preliminary experiments that sperm also has aminopeptidase activity.",

Specimens were kept in aquaria at 88C. Spawning of oocyte and sperm was induced by transferring the mussels to warm natural seawater (NSW) at 258C. When the mussels started spawning, they were returned to NSW at 88C. Oocytes and sperm were washed with filtered NSW (FNSW) several times before use. Concentrations of oocyte were determined by counting the number of oocytes aspirated into 5-ml glass capillary tubes. Concentrations of sperm in the suspensions were determined using a hemocytometer by counting the number of sperm fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Sperm-oocyte ratio (R s/o ) in the medium at insemination was an absolute ratio. Artificial induction of AR was carried out by adding 10% (v/v) isotonic 0.33 M CaCl 2 to the sperm suspension (Tamaki and Osanai, 1985) .",

Tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm was analyzed by immunoblotting of SDS-solubilized sperm extracts with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and a difference in banding patterns and optical densities was measured between the treatments (Figs. 3 and 4) . Insemination significantly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins in sperm (Fig. 3A , black and white arrowheads, compare lanes 1 and 2; Fig. 4 ). The other bands had no significant differences between noninseminated and inseminated sperm (data not shown). PI-PLC-treatment inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 3A, lane 3; Fig. 4 ). When sperm were inseminated in the presence of aminopeptidase substrate Phe-MCA, tyrosine phosphorylations of the proteins was also inhibited (Fig. 3A, lane 4; Fig. 4 ). Finally, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, inhibited the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation during induction of the AR (Fig. 3A, lane 5; Fig. 4 ). The specificity of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting was verified by the fact that the most of bands could be eliminated in the presence of L-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3B ). It appears that prominent bands between 75 and 105 kDa were not due to tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that GPI-anchored aminopeptidase on the sperm surface is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins during induction of AR. The 40 kDa band in Figure 3A (white arrowhead) might be related to the phosphorylation of Src-family tyrosine kinase, since anti-c-Src antibody recognized the same band (Fig. 3C , white arrowhead).",

            "text": "DISCUSSION Aminopeptidases belong to a group of exopeptidases that catalyze the cleavage of an amino terminal residue of proteins and are known to be a metalloenzyme containing Zn 2\u00fe as essential metal ions. They are widely found throughout the animal and plant kingdoms, and are localized in many subcellular organelles, in cytoplasm and as membrane components. The existence of aminopeptidase in sperm has been described in mammals and sea urchins (Yasuhara et al., 1983 (Yasuhara et al., , 1990 (Yasuhara et al., , 1991 Arienti et al., 1997; Schaller and Glander, 2000) , and it has been suggested that it contributes to sperm respiration in the sea urchin. Recent studies have suggested that aminopeptidase functions as a receptor protein in addition to a protease itself. For instance, it has been shown that coronaviruses and a Herpes virus use aminopeptidase as a receptor in their target tissue (Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992; Soderberg et al., 1993; Kolb et al., 1998) . GPI-anchored aminopeptidase has also been recognized as a receptor or specific binding protein for an insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis (Knight et al., 1995; Hua et al., 1998; Yaoi et al., 1999) .",

The clustering or ligation of GPI-anchored proteins to specific membrane regions can trigger transmembrane signal transduction (Brown and London, 1998; Simons and Toomre, 2000) . So far the GPI-anchored proteins involved in signaling are associated with signaling molecules that are typically bound to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. These proteins include the Srcfamily of tyrosine kinases. It has been demonstrated that the patches that form around the aggregated GPIanchored proteins are enriched in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins as well as tyrosine kinases in BHK cells and Jurket T-lymphoma cells (Harder et al., 1998) . In macaque sperm, GPI-anchored hyaluronidase, PH-20, on the sperm surface appears to be a receptor for HA-induced cell signaling (Cherr et al., 2001) . It has been shown that treatment of sperm with HA or anti-PH-20 antibody induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the 92-kDa protein (Cherr et al., 2001) . It has also been demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins plays an important role in AR of mammalian sperm (for review: Baldi et al., 2002; Breitbart, 2002; Urner and Sakkas, 2003) .",

We also found that the 40 kDa protein may be related to Srcfamily kinase since anti-c-Src antibody recognized the Fig. 5 . Effects of tyrosine kinase activator 9,10-dimethyl-1,2benzanthracene (DMBA) and inhibitor genistein on the acrosome reaction of Mytilus sperm. A: Sperm were treated with various concentrations of DMBA for 10 min and acrosome-reacted sperm were counted under the microscope. B: Sperm suspension was incubated with genistein for 10 min, and unfertilized oocytes were added to the suspension. The rate of acrosome reaction (AR) was assayed 10 min after the insemination. same 40 kDa band in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, activation of tyrosine kinases induced the AR, and inhibition of the kinases suppressed the AR (Fig. 5) . Therefore, we speculate that tyrosine phosphorylation of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins, which is induced by the interaction of GPI-anchored aminopeptidase with oocyte surface, triggers the AR in Mytilus. Some molecules, for example, aminopeptidase substrate, on the oocyte surface that are recognized by aminopeptidase may function as AR-inducing substance in Mytilus, although the nature of this substance is still unknown.",

Samples in (A) and (B) are: noninseminated sperm (lane 1), inseminated sperm (lane 2), sperm treated with PI-PLC and inseminated (lane 3), inseminated sperm in the presence of Phe-MCA (lane 4), and genistein treated and inseminated sperm (lane 5). Black and white arrowheads indicate the positions of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins during induction of AR. The protein indicated by white arrowhead in (A) is also recognized by anti-c-Src antibody as indicated in (C).",
