The PEMS-associated mortality and growth depression is related to malabsorption and decreased metabolic activity caused, in part, by a possible insulin deficiency or insensitivity. Insulin receptors are stimulated by the glucose tolerance factor (GTF) that incorporates Cr. Body Cr deficiency can be exacerbated by dietary deficiency and by increased excretion due to stress associated with a diarrheal disease such as PEMS. BioChrome (BC) contains natural, preformed GTF, the bioactive form of Cr. Experiments were conducted in which BC was blended into poult starter feed at 400 ppb during the first 21 d posthatch. Body weights were determined at 1, 7, 14, and 21 d of age, and weekly feed conversions were calculated for each treatment (",

At 6 d posthatch, each PEMS-designated poult was given a 0.1-mL oral gavage of a 10% suspension of feces from PEMSinfected poults. Blood samples were taken via cardiac puncture from four birds per treatment group at 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 d of age. Radioimmunoassays were conducted for plasma insulin, glucagon, thyroxine (T 4 ), and triiodothyronine (T 3 ). Plasma insulin levels were depressed in PEMS-infected poults from Days 10 through 17, but plasma glucagon levels in the PEMS-infected poults were significantly elevated at 14 and 17 d, after which they returned to control levels in both of the PEMSinfected groups. The T 3 and T 4 levels were depressed through Day 21 in PEMS-infected poults, but with BC treatment these blood hormone levels rebounded by Day 21. Body weights of PEMS-infected poults were increased significantly by the BC treatment but not to the level of noninfected controls. (Edens et al., 1997a,b,c; Qureshi et al., 1997) . Therefore, malabsorption and metabolic dysfunction could be contributing to the disease. Indeed, absorption of D-xylose was inhibited significantly in PEMS-infected poults (Doerfler et al., 2000) , clearly indicating that part of the wasting syndrome in PEMS is due to their inability to absorb sufficient quantities of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract.",

Insulin is a hormone that promotes anabolic processes and inhibits catabolic processes in muscle, liver, and adipose tissues. The action of insulin is stimulated by the glucose tolerance factor (GTF), with Cr as its active component. Hence, Cr stimulates and regulates the action of insulin, although the underlying mechanism is not clear (Roginski and Mertz, 1969; Kahn, 1978) . However, Evans and Bowman (1992) have shown that Cr facilitates insulin internalization in cells in vitro, as well as an increase in the uptake of glucose and leucine. Chromium is an essential trace element required for the normal metabolism of both lipids and carbohydrates. The status of Cr in animals can be diminished by poor availability in the feed, feed quality with high levels of simple sugars, infection, physical trauma, and elevated excretion due to stress associated with a diarrheal disease (Anderson, 1986 (Anderson, , 1994 .",

In control poults, BC did not influence BW, but in PEMS-infected poults, BC induced a small, but significant, increase in BW by the time the birds were 21 d of age (Table 1) . We determined the influence of BC on feed to BW FCR in normal and PEMS-infected poults. These FCR data confirmed that BC had improved FCR in the PEMSinfected poults. The BC-treated, PEMS-infected poults ate less feed but were more efficient in converting it to body mass, possibly indicating improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and improved nutrient uptake from the intestine. This response would not account for a significant FCR increase in BC alone or PEMS with BC supplementation. The significantly elevated FCR in PEMS alone was related to diarrhea, decreased feed intake, and malabsorption of nutrients. However, the increase in FCR associated with BC supplementation probably was related to elevated levels of metabolically active hormones such as the thyroid hormones (Table 2 ; Figures 3 and 4) , which were greater in control and BC-treated poults than in PEMS alone. Hepatic glycogen was being synthesized (Table 3) , IGF-I and -II were elevated (Table 2 and Figures  5 and 6) , and BW of BC-fed, PEMS-infected poults were elevated by nearly 132% (Table 2) in comparison with PEMS-infected poults without BC. These changes in the levels of metabolically active hormones, metabolites, and BW account for the significant interaction among treatments noted for each measurement. For these observations to be made, PEMS-infected poults with BC supplementation had have more efficient feed use to meet metabolic needs for energy production and weight accretion.",

Plasma glucose was not affected by feed supplemented with BC (Table 2, Figure 7) . However, an interesting BC effect was found in the hepatic glycogen response to PEMS (Table 3 ). In earlier studies we reported a significant depression in hepatic glycogen in PEMSinfected poults (Doerfler et al., 1998) , and in the current study a similar response was observed. However, in the BC-supplemented, PEMS-infected poults, hepatic glycogen levels were comparable to levels found in noninfected controls. In view of the observation that plasma glucose can be decreased with injections of IGF-I and IGF-II (McMurtry et al., 1996 (McMurtry et al., , 1997 , one must assume that the glucose uptake in the liver of PEMS-infected poults treated with BC had to be facilitated by the BC-elevated IGF. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity in PEMS survivor poults was near the levels found in noninfected control poults (Table 3 ). The decrease in hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity would be expected if glucose uptake was mediated by elevated blood glucose or by stimulation of insulin receptors by insulin or IGF (McMurtry et al., 1996 (McMurtry et al., , 1997 . Therefore, BC-related increases in IGF may have stimulated hepatic uptake of glucose in PEMSinfected poults, resulting in a significant decrease in glucose-6-phosphatase activity.",

Additionally, Edens and Doerfler (1997a,b) and Doerfler et al. (1998) reported that PEMSinfected poults appear unable to absorb glucose from the intestine and to utilize blood glucose in the liver. These problems were attributed to the decreased level of metabolically active hormones in the circulatory system. This condition in PEMS creates a paradox because PEMS-related hypoglycemia inhibits insulin secretion. Normally, in the liver and under the influence of insulin, glucose is converted to fatty acids, but in PEMS this does not appear to occur (Edens and Doerfler, 1997a) . In PEMS-infected poults, liver weights are decreased and hepatic mitochondria are severely damaged (Edens and Doerfler, 1997b) . Insulin inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein and amino acid sequestration in all target tissues (Berne and Levy, 1993) . In PEMS-infected poults, muscle wasting and lipolysis are evident (Edens and Doerfler, 1997a,b) , suggesting that insulin is not functioning properly or that it is decreased significantly as reported herein. The plasma insulin profile in PEMS-infected poults noted in this study strongly suggests that wasting and FIGURE 3.

However, the supplementation of BC in the diet of these PEMS-infected poults did not elevate plasma insulin, but BW did have a small but significant increase in the BC-supplemented birds. In addition, hepatic glycogen levels were elevated and hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity decreased in the PEMSinfected, BC-supplemented poults, indicating that they had likely responded to BC by becoming more sensitive to the lower levels of available plasma insulin.",

The increase in IGF in the BC-treated, PEMS-infected poults may account for the small but significant increase in BW in this group, because it has been shown that IGF function through insulin receptors (Rechler, 1985; Prosser, 1991; McMurtry et al., 1996 McMurtry et al., , 1997 . These observations support the hypothesis that BC in PEMS-infected poults sensitized insulin receptors, permitting the infected poults to develop a metabolic condition that could better sustain them during the stress response caused by the disease.

Nevertheless, in PEMS-infected poults with BC supplementation, both of these plasma hormones were elevated to levels significantly greater than the levels found in PEMS without BC. The most obvious effects of thyroid hormones in domestic fowl are the increases in the rate of oxygen utilization and basal heat production (Hendrich and Turner, 1967) . The decrease in body temperature in PEMS, therefore, can be related directly to the hypothyrosis that normally occurs with this disease (Doerfler et al., 1998) . In this study, the increase in plasma thyroid hormones in response to BC supplementation apparently resulted in a metabolic energy demand. Even though the PEMS-infected poults responded positively to the BC supplementation, BW were not corrected during the study.",

Furthermore, Cr in mammals is recognized as an antistress agent (Mowat, 1994; Pagan et al., 1995; Mallard and Borgs, 1997 ) and, therefore, may have a potential role in the PEMS infection. Nutritional interventions into the PEMS problem appear to have a potential that is greater than the use of antibiotics, which is important because many of the bacterial pathogens isolated from PEMS-infected poults are antibiotic resistant or develop resistance very rapidly. It is believed that the pathogens that cause PEMS also induce pathology via disruption of the normal biochemical and physiological mechanisms that establish the individual bird's homeostatic condition and subsequently contribute to its eventual demise. The lack of assimilation of nutrients and the inability to utilize the nutrients that are absorbed from the intestinal tract are two of the primary contributors to the mortality and lack of growth in PEMSafflicted poults. Although there was only a small improvement in BW and FCR and no significant improvement in mortality for BC-fed, PEMS-infected poults, the data collected in these initial studies suggest that nutritional supplements may alleviate the intensity of the some of the symptoms of intestinal pathogenesis caused by bacterial or viral infection, may modulate the immune system, and may provide a stimulus to the metabolism of PEMS-afflicted poults.",
