The basic idea of CEPI is that when there is a perception that the commercial market is insufficient to justify private investment in vaccine development against an emerging pathogen, that manufacturers be reimbursed for the production of candidates that can be taken through phases 1 and 2 to provide initial evidence for safety and efficacy, followed by the production and maintenance of a stockpile for emergency use [ Table 2 ]. Inherent in this concept is that applicants must have a means of producing the candidate under Good Manufacturing Practice. In situations where a phase III trial is feasible owing to continued incidence of infection it would be done, although identification of a correlate of protection might be sufficient for confidence that the particular vaccine could be deployed in the event of an outbreak.
