The incubation period ranges from 2\u201313 days with a median of 5 days. MERS-CoV presents as a combination of non-specific symptoms such as cough, fever (\u226538 \u00b0C), dyspnea, diarrhea, and vomiting [5]. To distinguish a probable or confirmed case, a combination of symptoms and lab-confirmed data is necessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define two categories of laboratory tests used to detect MERS-CoV: (1) molecular tests, which look for active infection; and (2) serology tests, which look for previous infection [6]. Most, if not all hospitals, use real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays to define a confirmed case following CDC\u2019s standard. The CDC recommends conducting multiple tests on each patient. A single negative rRT-PCR would classify a patient as under investigation, or as a possible case. A second negative would classify the patient as MERS negative [6]. The Saudi Ministry of Health has adopted strict case definitions for the hospitals and created a wave of auditing and inspections to the hospitals to ensure compliance with infection control practices to prevent further healthcare outbreaks.

All hospital services continued without interruptions except for MERS patients\u2019 precautions in the designated ICU. IDEP Phase II included several actions including (1) conversion of an entire ward into a negative pressure, isolation unit for the treatment of suspected and confirmed non-ICU cases; (2) restricting visitors entering the hospital; (3) reducing the number of elective surgeries; (4) implementing contact tracing to unprotected health care workers (HCWs) and staff; and (5) ensuring mask and PPE fit testing for HCWs in high risk areas.

Moreover, they increase with the rates of becoming symptomatic due to the isolation of symptomatic infectious patients, in general, and out of the ED, in particular; noting that asymptomatic patients are still infectious but to a lesser degree. Additionally, increasing the relative reduction of infectiousness from the HCWs to patients may be due to the lack of gloves and gowns, would increase the sizes of the epidemics.

Thus, the transmission factors of MERS-CoV resulting in healthcare outbreaks is certainly multifactorial. Crowded emergency departments are not uncommon in hospital systems; in these situations, effective acute respiratory infection (ARI) screening is vital to determine patient priority and treatment.

The model outputs were validated by comparing actual data to modeled proportions. The underlying SEIR-ward model for KAMC confirms the importance of including additional spatial-specific characteristics to replicate transmission and super spreading events of infectious disease transmission occurring in different hospital wards. That would assist in identifying the most infectious ward. It also quantifies the role of the different individuals in the disease spread. The small number of people in each ward and state might be a problem when using a deterministic model and a stochastic model is warranted; however, the strength of the disease without the control measures was a main factor in our selection.",

Previous estimates of an overall R0 (which involves both index and secondary cases) for MERS-CoV ranged from 0.42 to 0.92 [24,25,26,27]. In the later study, R0 value was 1.5 for index cases resulting from animal-to-human transmission. In another analysis, Chowel et al. [13] showed that index cases have an Ri of 0.84 compared to Rs of 0.36 for secondary cases, indicating that potential disease transmission is higher for index cases than for secondary cases. An important finding from the study of Chowel et al. (2014) that hospital-based transmission was 4.3\u20134.6-fold higher than community-based transmission [12,24,25,26,27].",
