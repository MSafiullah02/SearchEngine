It has had relatively few infections: As of 8 April 2020, there were 379 confirmed cases with 5 deaths in Taiwan, compared with 1 371 189 cases with 80 522 deaths globally. Imported COVID-19 cases have constituted most infections in Taiwan (326 imported vs. 53 locally acquired), suggesting that community outbreaks have been less frequent. Other proactive measures undertaken by the Taiwanese government have included strengthening quarantine measures at ports of entry, retrospectively identifying potential COVID-19 cases, and identifying new infection patterns or symptoms and clustered cases to promptly track potential infection sources or paths. The government has also aggressively enforced rules about mask wearing, self-quarantine, and social distancing (1) .",

In response to a shortage of surgical masks due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in late January 2020 the Taiwanese government imposed a ban on the export of surgical masks and requisitioned all domestically produced masks. In early February 2020, the government implemented a rationing system for distributing surgical masks to prevent panic buying (2). This system uses multilayer logistics to ensure quick and efficient implementation. It integrates the manufacturing sector, National Health Insurance (NHI) system, information and communication technology, and logistics of delivery and distribution to ensure that all citizens receive masks while prioritizing the allocation of sufficient masks to health care personnel. Surgical mask production was quickly scaled up in early April 2020 to 13 million masks a day for Taiwan's population of 23.8 million to allow for an increase in the individual allowance to 10 masks every 2 weeks.",

A real-time, open tracking system for mask availability was immediately implemented at each pharmacy using website and mobile applications to guide citizens in need of masks. The system included online chatbots and voice assistants that provided information about the supply of masks and the locations of the 6515 NHI-contracted pharmacies across the nation. Community pharmacists repacked the bulk packages of masks into unit packets containing the rationed amount and completed the NHI online procedures for residents in their communities. Often serving as the first point of contact between individuals and the health care system, community pharmacists offered education and consultation on proper hygiene strategies, disseminated accurate information to counter myths and misinformation, and provided emotional support to alleviate public concerns arising from the COVID-19 crisis. At this time, dispensing services provided in community pharmacies have been particularly crucial in minimizing the potential for a large influx of patients seeking prescriptions from hospital pharmacies.",

Stringent policies have been implemented to control access to Taiwanese hospitals. Unessential visits have been suspended, and persons with any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 are directed to an outdoor quarantine station for evaluation or the emergency department for isolation in negatively pressurized rooms (3) . Other measures have included the strict diversion and transport of patients with COVID-19 to different levels of hospitals on the basis of the severity of their symptoms and the segregation of hospital wards to ensure appropriate patient care (4) .",

Small pharmacies have had difficulty managing the large influx of citizens seeking services, some of whom are extremely anxious.

The provision of COVID-19 -related services, which gives little to no monetary compensation, can interfere with routine pharmacy practices, and an optimal business model for pharmacies during this period (including minimizing promotional activities and encouraging electronic payments) has been recommended (6) . Large crowds seeking prevention and control strategies or products in pharmacies may create risk for virus transmission (6) . In Taiwan, an online service platform for purchasing surgical masks from governmental websites has been developed to relieve overcrowding in pharmacies and reduce virus transmission. On the other hand, some Taiwanese hospitals have encouraged patients to return for prescription refills at their outpatient pharmacies, potentially increasing risk for exposure to the infection. The government and pharmacy associations have responded by urging the public to maximize their use of services provided by community pharmacists during this crisis. Finally, drug shortages are a potential problem due to the recent supply chain disruptions caused by the lockdown of manufacturers in areas affected by COVID-19. Identifying alternative drugs and minimizing requests for no substitution are potential solutions to mitigate this problem (6) .",
