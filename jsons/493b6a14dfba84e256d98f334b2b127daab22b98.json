The HPS contains a realistic airway and is programmed to remove oxygen and inject carbon dioxide into the system according to a preset respiratory exchange ratio and oxygen consumption. The lung compliance can also be changed to simulate different degrees of lung injury during chest infection. By varying the oxygen consumption (200, 300, and 500 ml/min) and lung compliance (70, 35, and 10 ml/cmH 2 O), these sets of values produce a range of tidal volumes, respiratory rates, and peak inspiratory fl ow similar to those of patients with minimal (essentially normal lung function), moderate, or severe lung injury, respectively. For example, lung compliance is set at 35 ml/cm H 2 O and oxygen consumption at 300 ml/min to mimic mild lung injury. Tidal volume and respiratory rate are regulated so a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 is maintained during measurements. Typically, this is achieved with a tidal volume of 300 ml and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min [ 10 -13 ] . Lung compliance and airway resistance also responds in a realistic manner to relevant respiratory challenges. The HPS produces an airfl ow pattern that is close to the in vivo situation. It has been applied in previous studies to simulate human respiration [ 14 -17 ] . Deliberate leakage from the exhalation ports of the Mirage mask (ResMed, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) [ 10 ] , ComfortFull 2, and Image 3 masks (Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA) [ 11 ] fi rmly attached to a high-fi delity HPS (HPS 6.1; Medical Education Technologies, Sarasota, FL, USA) has been evaluated. NIV was applied using a bilevel positive airway pressure device (VPAP III ST; ResMed) via each mask. The inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was initially set at 10 cmH 2 O and gradually increased to 18 cmH 2 O. The expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) was maintained at 4 cmH 2 O throughout the study [ 10 , 11 ] .",

Hence, the maximum distribution of exhaled air, marked by very fi ne smoke particles, from the HPS during application of NIV using three face masks was examined by the laser smoke visualization method on a high-fi delity HPS model. The studies showed that the maximum distances of exhaled air particle dispersion from patients undergoing NIV with the ResMed Ultra Mirage mask was 0.5 m along the exhalation port [ 10 ] . In contrast, the dispersion distances of a low, normalized concentration of exhaled air through the ComfortFull 2 mask exhalation diffuser increased from 0.65 to 0.85 m at a direction perpendicular to the head of the HPS along the sagittal plane when IPAP was increased from 10 to 18 cmH 2 O. There was also more background contamination of the isolation room at the higher IPAP [ 11 ] . Even when a low IPAP of 10 cmH 2 O was applied to the HPS via the Image 3 mask connected to the whisper swivel exhalation port, the exhaled air leaked far more diffusely than from the ComfortFull 2 mask, dispersing a low normalized concentration of 0.95 m along the median sagittal plane of the HPS. The higher IPAP resulted in wider spread of a higher normalized concentration of smoke around the HPS in the isolation room with negative pressure [ 11 ] .",

However, evidence supporting its use in patients with pneumonia is limited. NIV was applied to patients with severe pneumonia caused by a 2009 pandemic infl uenza (H1N1) infection with a success rate of about 41 %. Although there were no reported nosocomial infections [ 21 ] , there is a potential risk of applying NIV to patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia on a crowded medical ward with inadequate air changes [ 7 ] . In this regard, deliberate leakage via the exhalation ports may generate droplet nuclei and disperse infective aerosols through evaporation of water content of respiratory droplets, resulting in a superspreading event. Nonetheless, NIV was applied using a single circuit to treat patients effectively with respiratory failure due to SARS in hospitals with good infection control measures (including installation of powerful exhaust fans to improve the room air change rate and good protective personal equipment at a level against airborne infection). There were no nosocomial infections among the health care workers involved [ 22 , 23 ] . In contrast, a case-control study involving patients in 124 medical wards of 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong identifi ed the need for oxygen therapy and use of NIV as independent risk factors for superspread of nosocomial SARS outbreaks [ 6 ] . Similarly, a systematic review has shown a strong association between ventilation, air movement in buildings, and airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, infl uenza, smallpox, and SARS [ 24 ] .",

NIV should be applied in patients with severe community acquired pneumonia only if there is adequate protection for health care workers because of the potential risk of transmission via deliberate or accidental mask interface leakage and fl ow compensation causing dispersion of a contaminated aerosol [ 10 , 11 ] . Pressure necrosis may develop in the skin around the nasal bridge if the NIV mask is applied tightly for a prolonged period of time. Many patients loosen the mask strap to relieve discomfort. Air leakage from the nasal bridge is defi nitely a potential means of transmitting viral infections. Fitting a mask carefully is important for successful, safe application of NIV. Addition of a viral/bacterial fi lter to the breathing system of NIV, between the mask and the exhalation port, or using a dual-circuit NIV via full face mask or helmet without heated humidifi cation may reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of a viral infection [ 11 , 25 ] .",

This is especially true in the setting of an infl uenza pandemic with the high potential of human-to-human transmission for fear of causing a major outbreak of nosocomial infections.

The inertia and weight of large droplets in an air-droplet two-phase fl ow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than occurs with the continuous air carrier phase during which the particles travel with increased inertia and drag. However, evaporation of the water content of some respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing when exposed to NIV may produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the large droplets fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway [ 10 -13 ] . As smoke particles mark the continuous air phase, the data contours described refer to exhaled air. The results would therefore represent the \"upper bound\" estimates for dispersion of the droplets-which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than an air jet due to gravitational effects-but not fully refl ect the risk of large-droplet transmission [ 10 -13 ] .",
