According to Chinese data 10 , a large number of transmissions, both in nosocomial and community settings, occurred through human-to-human contact with individuals showing no or mild symptoms. The estimated basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2.0 to 3.5 [11] [12] [13] , which seems comparable, or possibly higher, than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were found in upper respiratory specimens of patients showing little or no symptoms, with a viral shedding pattern akin to that of influenza viruses 14 .

One commonly used model is the SIR model 19 for human-to-human transmission, which describes the flow of individuals through three mutually exclusive stages of infection: susceptible, infected and recovered. More complex models can accurately portray the dynamic spread of specific epidemics. For the COVID-19 pandemic, several models have been developed. Lin and colleagues extended a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed) model considering risk perception and the cumulative number of cases 20 , Anastassopoulou and colleagues proposed a discrete-time SIR model including dead individuals 21 , Casella developed a control-oriented SIR model that stresses the effects of delays and compares the outcomes of different containment policies 22 and Wu and colleagues used transmission dynamics to estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19 23 . Stochastic transmission models have also been considered 24, 25 . Here, we propose a new mean-field epidemiological model for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy that extends the classical SIR model, similar to that developed by Gumel and colleagues for SARS 26 . A summary of the main findings, limitations and implications of the model for policymakers is shown in Table 1 .",

            "text": "Discussion on modeling choices. In the model, we omit the probability rate of becoming susceptible again, after having already recovered from the infection, because this appears to be negligible based on early evidence 27 . Given the scarcity of available data, it is impossible to have conclusive evidence about immunity at this stage. Immunity might also be temporary 38 . Although some reports suggest the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection 27, 39, 40 , the indicated presence of viral RNA in respiratory samples might reflect a persistence rather than a true recurrence. The literature on the recrudescence of related members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is similarly sporadic. MERS-CoV reinfection despite serum detection of neutralizing antibodies has been described only in animals 41, 42 , while the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum via primary infection or passive transfer has been shown to prevent respiratory tract replication of SARS-CoV in a murine model 43 . From a modeling perspective, we are particularly interested in predictions over a relatively short horizon within which the temporary immunity is likely still to be in place, and the possibility of reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of susceptible individuals and so there would be no substantial difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves we consider. To provide solid support to this claim, Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the results of numerical simulation of the model when the possibility of reinfection is introduced: the evolution is almost identical, with the only difference being that the recovered population of course decreases over time. Hence, based on the evidence at hand, although we cannot rule out that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may not provide long-lasting protection, we may reasonably consider the probability of reinfection to be negligible within the scope of our model. Also, our model accounts for a distinction between non-diagnosed individuals, who spread the infection more because they are not in isolation, and diagnosed individuals, who transmit the disease much less thanks to proper isolation and complying with strict rules, either in hospital or at home. Because Italy is on lockdown, extended emergency measures nationwide are being applied to contain the epidemic: unless indispensable for fundamental activities, people are forced to stay at home in family settings, drastically reducing the risk of spreading the disease. Person-to-person household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described in China 44, 45 . Although the infection of household members of COVID-19-positive individuals is possible, the rate of this occurrence is difficult to estimate so far. The only way to completely avoid such risk is to separate infected individuals in dedicated quarantine centers 46 , as has been done partially in Italy, confining infected people in individual hotel rooms. Even with reduced admissions to hospital, patients that are treated at home and assisted by household members strictly comply with the home isolation guidelines issued by experts 47 , ranging from sanitary hygiene measures (including waste management, cleaning of contaminated surfaces and household laundering) to interhuman contact measures among family members (the caregiver of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected individual in home isolation must be in good health and maintain a distance of at least 1 m, avoiding direct contact with oral or respiratory secretions, faeces and urine; moreover, a surgical mask and disposable gloves should always be used). Hence, we can safely assume that in-house transmission is severely limited.",

Moreover, recent studies estimated median serial interval values for COVID-19 to be close to or shorter than the median incubation period 51, 52 , further proving the possibility of presymptomatic transmission of the disease.

Perhaps more importantly, it can also be explained by the Italian criteria for (provisional) statistics, which lead to overestimation. In fact, unlike other countries, the official numbers for COVID-19 deaths provisionally include the deaths of all people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even when they had multiple pre-existing life-threatening diseases and the exact cause of death had not yet been ascertained, so these numbers still need to be confirmed 55 . Thus, an important challenge in tuning the model is that the initial data are affected by statistical distortion: in particular, the values of the ratio death/infected are highly overestimated. The model fitting process must take this problem into account. Therefore, we decided to fit the parameters based on the data about the diagnosed infected population and the number of recovered diagnosed patients, but not on the data about deaths. It is also worth stressing that, in the long run, the model is weakly sensitive to the initial conditions; for this reason, the initial mismatch concerning the mortality data has little impact.",

On the other hand, our parameters are control tuning knobs whose values should realistically reproduce the data and the reproduction number R 0 in plausible scenarios. Relying on a priori epidemiological and clinical information about the relative parameter magnitude (as discussed above), and starting from a random initial guess, the model parameters have been fitted by reiterated local minimization of the sum of the squares of the errors.

The current number of infected (including all stages), the number of recovered and the cumulative number of diagnosed cases are well reproduced, but a small mismatch can be noted in the last days when distinguishing between different SOI. This discrepancy can have two interpretations: on the one hand, the model considers infected with different severities (for example, T(t) is the number of life-threatened patients that would need ICU admission) while the data report the actual treatment that the patients received (for example, the number of patients actually admitted to ICUs, which is constrained by the number of available beds and can be limited if the infected suddenly and quickly worsen, leading to death, before admission to the hospital). Hence, our overestimation of ICU patients may be due to saturation of the healthcare system, which is neglected in the model, or to the sudden worsening of infected who die at home before having the time to reach the ICU. Another possible explanation for our overestimation of patients with symptoms, and life-threatening symptoms, and our underestimation of patients that are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, is that the average age of infected people is getting lower and lower, and younger patients are less likely to show serious or life-threatening symptoms.",

The fraction of patients in need of intensive care, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d , reaches its peak on day 198, amounting to 5.3% of the population. The adopted social-distancing policy, although mild, has some impact and helps gain more time to strengthen and supply the healthcare system, but is still insufficient.",

Distinguishing between diagnosed and not diagnosed cases allows us to highlight the perceived distortion in disease statistics, such as the number of infected individuals, the transmission rate and the CFR (the ratio between the number of deaths ascribed to the infection and the number of diagnosed cases). The discrepancy between the actual CFR (total number of deaths due to the infection, divided by the total number of people who have been infected) and the perceived CFR (number of deaths ascribed to the infection, divided by the number of people who have been diagnosed as infected) can be quantified based on this model. Therefore, the model can explain the possible discrepancy between the actual infection dynamics and the perception of the phenomenon. Misperception (either resulting in underestimating or overestimating) can be particularly relevant in the early phases of an epidemic phenomenon due to the lack of thorough information: for example, performing an insufficient number of tests may lead to underestimating the transmission rate (because many infected subjects are not diagnosed as such) and overestimating the CFR (because critical or fatal cases hardly go undetected). The model thus provides a rough quantification of the error in estimating the actual number of infected people due to the lack of proper diagnostic tests, or due to insufficient number of diagnostic tests being performed. Also, it can explain and predict the long-term effects of underdiagnosis, including the (apparently surprising) increased number of infections and fatalities, with sudden outbreaks after long silent periods.",

Sensitivity analysis showing the effect of introducing lack of immunity (hence, the possibility of reinfection) after day 50: recovered individuals can become susceptible again, so we add a term +\u03c7H(t) in equation (1) and a term \u2212\u03c7H(t) in equation (7), where \u03c7 represents the rate at which immunity is lost.
