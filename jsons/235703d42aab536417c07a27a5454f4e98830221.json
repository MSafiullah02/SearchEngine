Over the last decade, federal, state, and local governments in the US have made concerted efforts to enhance preparedness within the public health, medical, and emergency response systems to address this threat. These activities span a wide range of areas from the enactment of new legal authorities and legislative changes to signi fi cant fi nancial investments to enhance multiple detection and response system capabilities and the adoption of a national command and control structure for response. Many of these investments, although prompted by the concern for bioterrorism, have served to strengthen public health, medical, and emergency response systems overall and have proven invaluable in responses to other large-scale emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 in fl uenza pandemic.",

In 2001, this concern became a reality for the US when several letters containing anthrax spores were sent through the postal system to individuals and organizations [ 14 ] . This resulted in 22 cases of anthrax (11 inhalational and 11 cutaneous) with fi ve deaths. Although this event may not have been the type of \"mass-casualty\" situation most bioterrorism preparedness planning activities were targeting, it still resulted in signi fi cant response efforts and cost; over 10,000 individuals were offered antibiotic prophylaxis because of possible exposures, over one million clinical and environmental specimens were tested, and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on decontamination of the buildings where the letters were processed or opened [ 12, 22 ] .",

            "text": "Although many infectious agents are capable of causing human illness, some are much more capable of causing signi fi cant morbidity and mortality if successfully used as a bioterrorism agent. In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a process to prioritize biological threat agents based on evaluation of the following threat agent characteristics: (1) public health impact from ability to cause illness or death, (2) ability to be produced and delivered in a way that could expose a large number of people, (3) existing public perceptions of a biological agent that could contribute to heightened fear and panic, and (4) requires signi fi cant special preparedness efforts in order to diagnose, treat, or prevent illness [ 20 ] . Based on these characteristics, biological threat agents were prioritized into three different tiers. Category A (highest threat tier) included Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Variola virus (smallpox), Yersinia pestis (plague), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), Clostridium botulinum toxin (botulism), and the Filo and Arenaviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg virus) that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers. Category B and C were lower threat tiers and included agents such as Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei , Rickettsia prowasekii (Category B), and emerging threats such as Nipah virus (Category C). Following the release of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD- 10) in April 2004, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) became responsible for issuing biannual assessments of biological threats in order to guide the prioritization of ongoing investments in research, development, planning, and preparedness [ 23 ] .",

            "text": "The United States has made signi fi cant investments in terrorism preparedness and response coordination over the last two decades that includes the implementation of new policies, legislation, and legal authorities in addition to signi fi cant funding investments. In 1995, Presidential Directive 39 added a terrorism annex to the Federal Response plan and de fi ned responsibilities of federal agencies in responding to terrorism [ 25 ] . The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a new cabinet level of fi ce whose primary mission is to prevent or reduce vulnerability of the United States to terrorism at home; coordinate homeland security responsibilities between the federal government and state, local and private entities; and minimize damage resulting from attacks and assist in the recovery. In 2003, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) established a nationwide system to coordinate responses to emergencies between local, state, and federal governments and responding organizations and to administer this all hazards National Response Plan through a National Incident Management System (NIMS) that provides for uni fi ed command and better multi-agency coordination [ 24 ] . Other Presidential Directives and legislation enacted in the US since the World Trade Center and anthrax letter events in 2001 have provided stronger legal frameworks and public health capacity to prevent, prepare, and respond to intentional acts of biological terrorism. The 2002 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act (PHSBPRA) established new requirements for possession, use, and transfer of selected biological agents and toxins (Select Agent List) that could pose threats to human, animal, and plant health and safety as well as established other authorizations and appropriations necessary to carry out essential public health and medical preparedness and response activities [ 19 ] . This act authorized more than 1.5 billion US dollars in grants to state and local governments and healthcare facilities to improve planning, training, detection, and response capacity as well as funding to expand the federal Strategic National Stockpile of medications and vaccines and upgrade food inspection capacity and CDC facilities that deal with public health threats. The Project Bioshield Act (July 2004) and Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (December 2006) also speci fi cally provided for new authorities and funding to address signi fi cant gaps that existed for the development, acquisition, and utilization of medical countermeasures (e.g. antimicrobials, vaccines, chemical antidotes) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.",

The Model Act (available at http://www.publichealthlaw.net/MSEHPA/MSEHPA. pdf ) outlines fi ve major public health functions to be allowed by law including preparedness, surveillance, management of property, protection of persons, and communication. In addition to ensuring suf fi cient authority to collect disease surveillance data, conduct contact tracing, and provide preventive measures to those at risk, public health laws must enable local health of fi cials to implement quarantine measures, if needed, to control a contagious disease outbreak with epidemic potential that could lead to severe morbidity or mortality (e.g. smallpox). This authority should be linked with speci fi c, scienti fi cally appropriate criteria that would be met before quarantine could be implemented. In addition, public health laws should provide for due process measures to protect those affected. Ideally, quarantine strategies would be determined and operational procedures would be in place prior to an emergency.",

Starting in 1999, the US Government began providing funding to 62 state, local, and territorial health departments to build stronger capacity for surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory diagnostic capacity, communications, countermeasure distribution, and emergency response planning, exercise, and evaluation. The initial investment into these public health system upgrades started at 40 million US dollars per year with a primary focus on addressing bioterrorism threats. Following the events of 2001, funding to support enhancements in the national public health infrastructure increased to approximately 1.5 billion per year. The current state of progress towards speci fi c preparedness goals identi fi ed for CDC funded preparedness and response activities in the 62 state, local, and US insular areas is provided in the \"2010 Report -Public Health Preparedness: Strengthening the Nation's Emergency Response State by State\" which can be found online at http://emergency.cdc.gov/ publications/2010phprep/ .",

            "text": "Additionally, more targeted investments have been made that address surveillance, detection, and illness prevention or treatment needs for speci fi c high priority threats. Examples of these targeted initiatives include the Laboratory Response Network (LRN), the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), and an environmental monitoring system called BioWatch. In 1999, the CDC and other partners formed the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) [ 3 ] . The LRN is a network of approximately 170 national and international public health, veterinary, agriculture, food, military, and environmental laboratories that have increased diagnostic capability for the rapid identi fi cation of multiple biological and chemical threat agents in multiple sample types. Participation in the network is voluntary and these pre-existing laboratories work under a single operational plan and adhere to policies on safety, security, and bio-containment. LRN members agree to perform testing using LRN procedures and are provided training, equipment, rapid detection assays and reagents, protocols, and secured communication and data reporting systems to increase testing and laboratory response capabilities in a standardized and coordinated fashion. There are three types of laboratory designation within the LRN: national, reference, and sentinel. National labs have unique capabilities and resources that allow them to handle highly infectious agents and perform strain-level identi fi cation and other agent characterization testing. Reference laboratories are mostly based at state and large city health departments and have the capability to perform rapid con fi rmatory testing for certain agents and toxins while sentinel laboratories (primarily hospital and commercial clinical laboratories) can perform routine clinical testing on patient specimens with additional training and protocols for noti fi cation and rapid referral of isolates in the event that they are unable to rule-out a biothreat agent. In addition to the central role the LRN played in detecting and responding to the 2001 anthrax letter event, the commitment to infrastructure support and standardized platform testing capacity within the LRN has also proven extremely bene fi cial in assisting with more rapid and broader deployment of tests developed in response to other emerging public health threats such as the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 H1N1 avian in fl uenza pandemic. LRN laboratories are also trained on chain-of-custody requirements and protocols which allow them to serve as a local testing resource for law enforcement linked samples where there is a concern for biological threat agents. Approximately 90% of the US population lives within 100 miles of an LRN laboratory, which provides for more rapid access to con fi rmatory diagnostic testing to evaluate potential illness from or exposures to threat agents.",

Without a pre-purchased and stored stockpile, most of these medications and vaccines would not be readily available through other sources in appropriate amounts or in a timeframe that would allow for the prevention or effective treatment of illness. Partnerships with storage and transportation companies have been created that provide strategically located storage facilities, allowing rapid delivery of SNS materiel to any location in the US or its territories within 12 h of the federal decision to deploy. Certain medical countermeasures may be eligible for the shelf-life extension program managed by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Defense, which allows for expiration date extension based on potency and other test results. In addition, agreements with pharmaceutical companies and medication distribution partners have allowed for rotation of certain medications back into the commercial supply chain for use prior to their expiration in order to help mitigate replacement costs. Although the SNS was originally developed as a medical countermeasure response resource for intentional biological, chemical, and radiological emergencies, it has been deployed and used multiple times to support the medical needs of other public health emergencies, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the recent H1N1 in fl uenza pandemic, the 2001 World Trade Center and the anthrax letter attacks.",

Traditional public health surveillance for illness associated with potential bioterrorism agents relies on enhancing the medical and laboratory communities' familiarity with these agents, with the goal of improved reporting of suspected or con fi rmed illnesses, as well as reporting of unusual disease manifestations or illness clusters. Most local and state health codes require that physicians, hospitals, and laboratories report a de fi ned list of noti fi able infectious diseases. State public health agencies have added CDC Category A and B agents to their reportable disease lists. These lists are available at http:// www.cste.org/dnn/Programs andActivities/PublicHealthInformatics/PHIState ReportableWebsites/tabid/1 36/Default.aspx. In addition, recognizing the need to detect newly emergent diseases that are not yet listed on the health code, most states also require reporting of any unusual disease clusters or manifestations. Early recognition of a bioterrorism-associated event depends in large part on astute clinicians and laboratorians recognizing one of the index cases based on a suspicious clinical, radiologic, or laboratory presentation (e.g. a febrile illness associated with chest discomfort and a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph in an otherwise healthy adult suggests inhalation anthrax). Isolated cases presenting at separate hospitals will not be recognized as a potential outbreak unless they are reported promptly to the local health department, where the population-based aberrations in disease trends are more likely to be noticed. Previous examples of astute clinicians recognizing and reporting unusual disease clusters or manifestations that led to the detection of a more widespread outbreak include an outbreak of hantavirus in the southwestern US [ 7 ] , Legionnaires' disease associated with the whirlpool on a cruise ship [ 13 ] , an outbreak of Cyclospora associated with contaminated raspberries imported from Guatemala [ 11 ] , and the initial outbreak of West Nile virus in New York City in 1999 [ 18 ] . Similarly, the initial detection of anthrax in 2001 was due to a physician who recognized that large gram-positive rods in a patient's cerebrospinal fl uid could be B. anthracis [ 1 ] . By reporting this suspected case of meningeal anthrax, rapid con fi rmation was facilitated in a state public health LRN reference laboratory. Weeks later, a suspected case of inhalation anthrax was recognized and promptly reported to and con fi rmed by public health authorities in New York City [ 17 ] .",

While initially conceived for early detection for bioterrorism, these systems also can be used to monitor natural infectious disease outbreaks and trends in noninfectious events of public health importance. Information from syndromic systems has proven to be useful for detecting, monitoring, and characterizing seasonal outbreaks of in fl uenza, winter gastroenteritis (e.g. norovirus and rotavirus) and asthma. Furthermore, syndromic systems were utilized extensively in the US during the novel H1N1 in fl uenza pandemic of 2009, along with other methods, to estimate the scale of community-wide in fl uenza transmission.",

If an agent can be detected quickly following an aerosol release, response timelines can be signi fi cantly improved, allowing for more time to intervene and potentially prevent illness in a signi fi cant portion of the exposed population. In 2003, the United States implemented BioWatch, an environmental monitoring system that consists of a network of samplers that collect air on a continuing cycle [ 21 ] . Filters from the monitors are removed on a frequent basis and screened in a laboratory for the presence of several biological threat agents. BioWatch is currently operational in multiple US cities. Environmental monitoring in this fashion requires a signi fi cant fi nancial commitment and is a complex system to operate as experience with this type of system was limited prior to its implementation. Natural environmental presence of the target organisms and/or very closely related organisms and the size of the area to be monitored present ongoing challenges for establishing system sensitivities and speci fi cities that appropriately balance the potential value of early detection of a bioterrorism attack with the risk of inappropriately responding to a positive test that is caused by naturally occurring organisms in the environment. A separate system of detectors has also been deployed that monitors the US mail system, the method of \"dissemination\" used in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks. The US Postal BioHazard Detection System (BDS) has been operational since 2004 [ 16 ] . Unlike traditional disease and syndromic surveillance systems for human and animal health which monitor for both intentional and naturally occurring disease, these environmental systems are single purpose with the primary focus being early warning of bioterrorism.",

This information will be most critical in the event of a covert bioterrorist event to determine where and when the attack occurred, and who else may have been potentially exposed (either at the event or due to downwind distribution of the aerosol) and thus require prophylaxis.

In this scenario, activities such as interviewing victims to determine the common site and/or sources of exposure, specimen or sample collection and testing, and public messaging would be coordinated with the FBI or other law enforcement of fi cials in order to preserve evidence and investigative information that may be essential for attribution and conviction of the perpetrators. Some activities such as sample collection or victim interviews may even need to be planned and conducted jointly by public health and law enforcement of fi cials. Although law enforcement has the responsibility for conducting the criminal investigation, their primary mission is also the preservation of life and health and investigative activities are targeted towards accomplishing that goal in addition to obtaining the evidence needed to identify and convict those responsible. Many local, state, and federal public health and law enforcement authorities in the US have recognized the investigation and communication coordination that would be required in a bioterrorism or other intentional chemical, radiological, or toxin induced event that affects the health of individuals or communities and have established working relationships for preparedness as well as formalized agreements for information sharing and joint investigative activities in this type of event. A model for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that can be used to create formalized working agreements between public health and law enforcement of fi cials was developed by a working group convened by the CDC and the US Department of Justice.

Many of these efforts, though initially begun to address the needs for bioterrorism preparedness, have proven bene fi cial for public health in responding to other emergencies, including those due to naturally occurring disease threats such as pandemic in fl uenza. Speci fi cally, efforts that focused on improving: (1) laboratory diagnostic capacity, (2) surveillance data sources, analysis, and reporting, (3) risk communication (4) emergency response planning and training, and (5) overall response coordination have proven extremely bene fi cial for supporting public health responses to all types of health threats. In most state and local health departments in the US, bioterrorism surveillance and response capacity is fully integrated into the general infectious disease and all hazards emergency response infrastructure. The same staff that surveil for and respond to both routine and emergency infectious disease outbreaks would be called upon to respond to a bioterrorism attack. This dual-use capacity is more ef fi cient and ensures that front line public health staff maintain and exercise the skills required to detect and respond to disease threats, regardless of whether intentional or natural. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided one of the best training opportunities for what might be encountered in the event of a large scale bioterrorist outbreak, including the need to implement enhanced surveillance to provide greater real time situational awareness, with the initial reliance on the public health laboratory system for reference testing, and the implementation of a large scale vaccination campaign. Although bioterrorism is not accorded the same level of concern everywhere, investments that help build or support stronger public health and medical systems provide the foundation for responding to all health threats and are essential, should an unthinkable event such as a large-scale bioterrorism attack occur.",
