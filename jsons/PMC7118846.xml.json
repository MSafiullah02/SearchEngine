Many studies from the 1970s and 1980s have shown that RSV is the dominant causative agent, and it is virtually the only agent inducing epidemics. RSV infection has been detected in 50% to 70% of patients with bronchiolitis [10], [12], [14]. RSV is a rare pathogen in older hospitalized children [10], [14] because nearly all children have been infected with RSV within the first 2 years of life, and a child's initial RSV infection is typically the most severe. RSV epidemics usually begin yearly in the late fall and peak in November to March. In some countries, such as Finland, RSV infections occur in double-humped outbreaks in 2-year cycles [1], [14].",

The clinical value of positive picornavirus PCR test has been questioned because RNA of these viruses has been detected in 20% to 40% of asymptomatic children [10], [13]. The authors have found that the degree of picornavirus PCR positivity markedly decreases over 2 to 3 weeks and disappears over 5 to 6 weeks after an acute wheezing episode, suggesting that positive picornavirus PCR is related to an acute symptomatic infection [13]. Rhinovirus outbreaks occur during the fall and spring, and enterovirus outbreaks usually occur only during the fall [14].",

Host cell recognition of viral RNA produced by viral replication initiates antiviral and proinflammatory responses within the cell. When newly synthesized viruses are released into the airway, the antiviral response is enhanced by mononuclear cells. Monocytes, macrophages, and probably dendritic cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, which further activate other cells and induce adhesion molecules. Because most recruited cells are neutrophils, it has been suggested that neutrophils and their activation products are important in the causation of airway obstruction. A few recruited cells are mononuclear cells and eosinophils. Lymphocytes also are recruited into the airways during the early stages of infection and are probably important in limiting the extent of infection and clearing virus-infected cells. Th1 and Th2 type responses have been implicated in infants with RSV bronchiolitis [26].",

The rhinovirus-induced antiviral response, as in the case in RSV infection, is considered to be responsible for the clinical symptoms. The antiviral response to rhinovirus infection includes type 1 interferons and nitric oxide and the production of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, epithelial neutrophil-activating protein-78, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), eotaxin 1/2, macrophage-inflammatory proteins, and leukotrienes, which influence the subsequent innate and specific immune response. Interferons are especially important in antiviral response because they are potent activators of antiviral effector cells as natural killer cells, CD8 T lymphocytes, and macrophages. The cellular response is mainly neutrophilic, but mast cells and eosinophils also infiltrate the infection site. Bronchial mucosal eosinophilic infiltrates have been found in biopsy specimens from healthy and asthmatic volunteers during an experimental rhinovirus infection [29]. The accumulation of eosinophils is influenced by IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-8, RANTES, and eotaxin [27].

According to Korppi et al [30], children with rhinovirus infection compared with children with RSV infection were older and presented more often with atopic dermatitis and blood eosinophilia. The groups did not differ in total serum IgE. Similarly, the authors have found a mean peripheral blood eosinophil count of 0.11 \u00d7 109/L and a neutrophil count of 3.48 \u00d7 109/L in children age younger than 2 years with the first wheezing attack induced by RSV, whereas in children with picornavirus bronchiolitis, the corresponding counts were 0.42 \u00d7 109/L and 5.87 \u00d7 109/L (unpublished findings). Although it is impossible to determine whether these differences are due to the virus, or whether they are related to a preexisting inflammation, there are great cellular differences in the courses of rhinovirus and RSV bronchiolitis. Eosinophilia and even neutrophilia in the peripheral blood are associated more clearly with rhinovirus bronchiolitis than RSV bronchiolitis.",

Nonreplicated studies may represent false-positive findings. Four interesting candidate genes have been highlighted in asthma, however. A role has been suggested for ADAM33 in airway remodeling and smooth muscle reactivity; for PHF11, in immunoregulation, especially that of B lymphocytes; for DPP10, in cytokine processing, especially in T cells; and for GPRA, in bronchial epithelial and smooth muscle surface receptor functions.

Although they confirmed that allergic diseases and asthma are associated with Th2 production (IL-5, eosinophilia, IgE production), they also showed that IFN-\u03b3 was associated with increased immediate skin test reactivity and with airway hyperreactivity [36]. These findings are in agreement with findings from a mouse model, suggesting that Th1 responses could increase the severity of allergic diseases and asthma [44]. IL-10 has been found to have a protective effect inhibiting immediate skin test reactions, as also stated earlier, but it also is associated with airway hyperreactivity in children without allergies and may increase the severity of airway disease in these subjects. The diversity of these responses may indicate that atopy is influenced not only by genetic heterogeneity, but also environmental effects, such as infections or exposure to allergens, which occur with varying intensities in different individuals [45].",

Interaction of viral infections in early life may be particularly important because RSV has been found to be an independent risk factor for the development of asthma [7], [8], [48], and a preliminary report suggests that this risk may be reduced by postponing the first RSV infection with RSV immunoglobulin [49].

The size of lymphocyte subpopulations shows marked changes during early life. The absolute number of B lymphocytes increases immediately after birth and remains unchanged until 2 years of age, then gradually decreases toward adult age. T lymphocytes increase after birth and decrease from 2 years to adulthood. Thymic involution starts at the age of 1 year and continues with a yearly loss of 3% [57]. The number of natural killer cells decreases over the first 2 months of life, then remains unchanged [58]. Cord blood has a decreased frequency of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, which present immunophenotypically with a higher degree of immaturity than adult dendritic cells [59]. Cord blood dendritic cells have a reduced ability to attain the mature adult phenotype and a reduced ability to activate naive CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3, suggesting that they are intrinsically preprogrammed against the generation of Th1 immune response [60].",

Poor production of IFN-\u03b3 may be attributed to decreased production of IL-12 [61]. Neonatal CD8 T cells produce high levels of IL-13, which may account for the type 2 bias [62].

Delayed priming led to less severe disease and enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production. RSV infection at a very young age has the potential to cause long-term alterations in the immune system [72].

Although no significant difference was found, probably owing to small sample size, the difference was significant between rhinovirus-positive and rhinovirus-negative cases. The authors have confirmed the finding in a 1-year follow-up of hospitalized children after their first bout of bronchiolitis. Asthma (ie, three physician-verified wheezing attacks within 12 months) was diagnosed in 21% of children after an RSV infection and in 64% of children after rhinovirus infection [87].

Stein et al [7] also reported, but did not adequately discuss, the finding that at age 13 years there still was a significant link between bronchiolitis and asthma in the groups of children with other virus or with negative microbiology.

Further limitations of earlier studies include the variable diagnostic criteria for bronchiolitis and asthma. Six studies have extended the age range of bronchiolitis over 12 months. The older the children are, the more likely they are to exhibit characteristics predisposing for persistent wheezing, such as eosinophilia, atopy, and rhinovirus infection [30]. The most common end points were recurrent wheezing reported by the parents and clinically diagnosed asthma, which are not reliable assessments and may overestimate lung impairment [2], [90]. Objective measurement of pulmonary function and physician-confirmed recurrent episodes of wheeze with a bronchodilator response are necessary for the diagnosis of asthma. Although baseline pulmonary function on follow-up is slightly decreased in the bronchiolitis groups of many studies, only two studies have shown evidence for bronchial hyperreactivity, characteristic of asthma [75], [78]. When considering the results of earlier studies and their limitations, a clear association can be seen between bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing, but the association between bronchiolitis and atopic asthma is not yet convincing [91].",

In a cross-sectional emergency department study, rhinovirus-induced wheezing was associated most strongly with atopy and eosinophilia [10]. Children with rhinovirus bronchiolitis also have higher blood eosinophil counts than children with RSV, as discussed earlier [30], [89]. Immunologic events related to Th2 polarization seem to be important predisposing factors not only to the development of asthma, but also to rhinovirus-induced bronchiolitis. The link between these diseases is more likely to be attributable to this suggested immunologic anomaly that precedes or is induced by rhinovirus bronchiolitis rather than to structural damage to the airway as a result of bronchiolitis [19]. The hypothesis that airway inflammation before virus inoculation may be a risk factor for an adverse response to rhinovirus is supported by findings from an experimental rhinovirus infection in young adults with mild asthma. The study of Zambrano et al [92] has shown that subjects with high levels of IgE had greater lower respiratory tract symptom scores during the initial 4 days of the infection than the low IgE group. These subjects also had higher total blood eosinophil counts at baseline, increased eosinophil cationic protein in their nasal washes, and higher levels of expired nitric oxide at baseline and during peak cold symptoms. In agreement, another study has shown that on histamine challenge after experimental rhinovirus infection, allergic adult subjects show higher airway reactivity than healthy controls [93].",

            "text": "Why is rhinovirus infection such a common trigger of asthma exacerbations? First, the answer may be related to the expression of ICAM-1 by epithelial cells. ICAM-1 mediates viral binding, host infection, and antiviral response, and it is up-regulated by airway inflammation, including the rhinovirus infection itself [94]. Because Th2 cells predominate within the asthmatic airways, Bianco et al [95] addressed the question by studying the effects of Th2-associated and Th1-associated cytokines and experimental rhinovirus infections on ICAM-1 expression in epithelial cells in vitro. Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) increased the ICAM-1 expression of uninfected and rhinovirus-infected cells, and these effects were dominant over the effects of IFN-\u03b3. Second, a rhinovirus infection generates various inflammatory mediators, which probably enhance the ongoing inflammatory response in asthmatic airways at least in some circumstances [96]. Many studies have shown that rhinovirus infection can enhance lower airway histamine responses and eosinophil recruitment after allergen exposure [24]. Third, and probably most important, a defective IFN-\u03b3 response may not be able to limit the extent of the infection to upper airways. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic asthmatics have produced lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in response to rhinovirus infection than the cells from healthy subjects [42]. An experimental rhinovirus infection in atopic subjects has shown an inverse relationship between precold rhinovirus-induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peak virus shedding after inoculation [97]. Similarly, stronger Th1 responses in sputum cells (higher IFN-\u03b3-to-IL-5 mRNA ratio) during induced colds have been found to be associated with milder cold symptoms and more rapid clearance of the virus [98]. Finally, the generation of IFN-\u03b3 has correlated directly with lung function [99]. These results together could explain why individuals with airway inflammation characterized by Th2 polarization and consequently by eosinophilia show increased susceptibility to and morbidity from rhinovirus infections and the associated exacerbation of asthma symptoms. The elevated secretion of IL-10 owing to rhinovirus infection may reduce partially the effectiveness of inflammatory mechanisms necessary for viral clearance and exacerbate airway inflammation and increase hyperreactivity.",

            "text": "Do viral infections contribute to sensitization to allergens? This is another important question, which cannot be answered exhaustively. Animal studies using experimental influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV infections have provided evidence that respiratory viral infections increase allergic sensitization to inhaled allergens and subsequently enhance airway inflammation, responsiveness, and obstruction [100], [101], [102], [103]. Respiratory viral infections have been shown to prevent tolerance induction and enhance IgE-mediated allergic sensitization to inhaled allergens when infection and sensitization have coincided. The possible mechanisms involve increased permeability of airway mucosa to allergens and the recruitment of dendritic cells to the respiratory epithelium. Consequently the sensitization could be facilitated by increased antigen uptake and more effective antigen presentation. It has been suggested that T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, IL-4, IL-5, and eosinophils are important regulators triggering airway hyperresponsiveness. Similarly, certain human respiratory viral infections may increase the risk of allergic sensitization by providing a local IL-4-high environment, as RSV studies show [50]. Recurrent respiratory viral infections with allergen exposure may contribute significantly to the onset of atopic asthma, but the full extent of these effects in humans remains to be evaluated.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are closely related to bronchiolitis and acute asthma. RSV is the major causative agent of bronchiolitis in young infants, whereas rhinovirus is an important trigger of asthma exacerbations, but also is recognized increasingly in slightly older children with bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is followed by recurrent wheezing or asthma in 5% to 50% of children during the first 2 decades of life. Preliminary data indicate that rhinovirus bronchiolitis is a more potent risk factor for school-age asthma than RSV bronchiolitis. The authors hypothesize that an important link between bronchiolitis and asthma is a person's susceptibility to certain lower respiratory tract viral infections, especially to rhinovirus infection. This susceptibility probably is related to the strong genetic component of atopy and possibly to eosinophilic airway inflammation response, which are likely not only to increase susceptibility, but also to exacerbate rhinovirus infection. The immature immune system of children age 1 to 2 years may increase susceptibility to respiratory viral infections, and their immature immune system may be vulnerable to permanent change induced by environmental factors, such as viral infections. Recurrent respiratory viral infections, especially with allergen exposure, may contribute markedly to airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity, and inception of atopic asthma. Lower respiratory tract rhinovirus infection in early life may be a first sign of asthma by identifying individuals with an underlying immunologic anomaly that predisposes to the development of asthma. Further studies are, needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
