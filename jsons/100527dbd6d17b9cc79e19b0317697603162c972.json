It comprises the process of identifying, between different data sources, entity descriptions that refer to the same real-world entity. In this work, we focus on toponym interlinking, that is we handle spatio-textual entities that are exclusively represented by their name; additional properties, such as categories, coordinates, etc. are considered as either absent or of too low quality to be exploited in this setting. Toponyms are inherently heterogeneous entities; quite often several alternative names exist for the same toponym, with varying degrees of similarity between these names. State of the art approaches adopt mostly generic, domain-agnostic similarity functions and use them as is, or incorporate them as training features within classifiers for performing toponym interlinking. We claim that capturing the specificities of toponyms and exploiting them into elaborate meta-similarity functions and derived training features can significantly increase the effectiveness of interlinking methods. To this end, we propose the LGM-Sim meta-similarity function and a series of novel, similarity-based and statistical training features that can be utilized in similarity-based and classification-based interlinking settings respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve large increases in accuracy, in both settings, compared to several methods from the literature in the widely used Geonames toponym dataset.",

As a result, multiple databases might exist for representing the same groups of real world entities, in heterogeneous ways.

A toponym might refer to a broad range of spatio-textual entities, from small places, to countries. In our problem setting, the name of a spatio-textual entity/toponym, is its only reliable attribute that can be used for identifying same entities; the other attributes, such as spatial coordinates, categories, extended textual descriptions, are either non-existent or of too low quality/accuracy to be used for interlinking. Consider the scenario of a toponym data provider that maintains a proprietary toponym database, and periodically enriches/extends it with toponym entities extracted from user check-ins in social media. It is quite often the case that a check-in regarding a specific place is performed in locations that are considerably distant from the actual place. In this case, the coordinates extracted for the specific place are inaccurate and might even hurt the interlinking process, e.g. by leading to the rejection of a link between two toponyms that are actually the same, but appear to have distant locations. The authors of [4] elegantly describe the problem of dealing with extremely noisy location coordinates in the Facebook database. In another scenario, the recognition and extraction of toponyms might be performed on documents (e.g. travel guides), where the coordinates of toponyms are non-existent. Further, in either scenario, no other properties of the toponyms, such as categories or extended textual descriptions, can generally be retrieved for the majority of the extracted toponyms.",

To this end, we analyse a large toponym dataset, Geonames 1 , which contains, among other toponym metadata, alternative names for millions of toponyms. Based on the insights we gain, we build an elaborate metasimilarity function, LGM-Sim, that takes into account and incorporates within its processing steps the specificities of toponym names. Additionally, we derive training features from LGM-Sim, that can be used for interlinking via classification. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models in two settings: similaritybased and classification-based toponym interlinking.",

Based on their study, no similarity measure achieves the highest accuracy in all datasets. In [4] , the problem of business places deduplication is studied, taking a different approach. In the proposed solution, certain words (core terms) are identified, that are of higher significance in the name deduplication process.

A framework for improving duplicate detection using learnable text distance functions is presented in [1] , however, in this work too, generic string similarity measures are used for the feature scores computation. The authors of [15] extract features for location name, coordinates, location type and demographic information. Then, machine learning algorithms are used to weight all features to solve the spatial entity matching problem. The work in [16] proposes a machine learning based approach to detect duplicate location entities. For this, a proposed metric is calculated for each key feature consisting of name, address and category similarity that describe entity pairs. Then, these extracted features are fed in a classification model to decide whether two entities are duplicates or not. Suport Vector Machine (SVM) and an alternating Decision Tree classifiers are used to combine different similarity features in [9] . The authors consider a variety of features corresponding to place name similarity, geospatial footprint similarity, place type similarity, similarity measures corresponding to semantic relations and temporal similarity. Contrary to these works, our study bases the matching process exclusively on toponym names. Utilizing richer spatio-textual profiles that enable the construction of features based on location-based, temporal or categorical similarity is beyond the scope of this work.",

Such methods consider as a given that the similarity functions they apply will be sufficiently accurate on identifying same entities, and focus on developing indexes, structures and schemes for optimizing the performance of the interlinking process, in terms of time-efficiency and scalability. Following a different rationale, the Magellan system, presented in [7] , aims to provide the tools to end users to exploit a wide range of techniques related to the entity matching process under a unified framework. However, the implemented similarity functions are generic, widely adopted similarities that are not specialized or properly tuned for the setting of comparing geospatial entities. Further, an integral concept in Magellan is user interaction, prescribing pipelines where automated interlinking tasks and user feedback are iteratively combined. These categories of works on interlinking solve orthogonal/complementary problems and are not directly comparable to our proposed methods.",

An indicative example would be the toponym: \"St. Paul's German Lutheran Church\". In this case, \"Church\" could be considered a non-core term, however, it is expected to be a frequent term.

The False toponym pairs are created by selecting a name and an alternate name from different toponym records of the initial dataset. The True toponym pairs are created by selecting the name and the alternate name from the same toponym record, but ensuring, to some extent, that some of the created pairs vary in their name. To measure the effectiveness of the evaluated methods, four standard IR measures are adopted: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score. To better evaluate the generalization capacity of the compared methods, we slightly modify the setting used in [14] , introducing a separate training set, where compared similarity methods are trained 4 . We keep the 5M toponym pairs test set the same as in [14] , for evaluating the trained models. The training set contains 100 K toponym pairs, equally balanced between True and False.

A third observation is that the introduced Tuned Jaro-Winkler Reversed similarity marginally increases the effectiveness of the Jaro-Winkler Reverse in the similarity based setting (79.8% vs. 79.6%), comprising a seemingly insignificant boost in Accuracy. Finally, we examine the most informative training features utilized by the best classifier on our problem, in terms of higher Accuracy, i.e. the Gradient Boosted Trees. Table 4 presents the top-10 features from higher to lower order of importance. A first observation is that the majority (7/10) of the top-10 training features are introduced in this work. This is consistent with the findings from Table 3 . Another observation is that variations of our proposed Tuned Jaro-Winkler measure comprise 3/10 most informative features, demonstrating that the proposed modification, despite its marginal effect in the similarity-based setting, it is rather useful in the classification based setting. Further, it becomes evident that appropriate sorting of toponym strings, following the processing of SortTerms, is of high importance, since 5/10 features incorporate this processing (either plain Sorted or LGM-Sim features). Finally, although the introduced statistical features seem promising, it is evident that they require more elaboration, since they occupy only the last two positions in the list.
