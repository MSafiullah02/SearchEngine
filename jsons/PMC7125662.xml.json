However, an unnecessary laparotomy could be harmful to a critical patient that could have been medically treated. Before making the decision to favor a surgical or medical approach, information must be gathered and the case approached in a logical manner: (1) review the possible causes of abdominal pain relevant to the particular case; (2) recognize the indications for immediate surgery; (3) determine if surgery is an option given the cost, facilities, and surgical abilities; (4) establish medical treatment before or during surgery; (5) if surgery is postponed, determine in advance a precise time and list criteria to be monitored to help decision-making; and (6) establish and present to the client a most realistic prognosis and cost estimate. A systematic approach based on adequate signalment and history, complete physical examination, and judicious choice of ancillary tests are the tools available to clinicians.",

A stomach tube should be passed to decompress the rumen. If no free gas is coming out of the tube, it might be a frothy bloat or intestinal volvulus. Abnormal findings at rectal palpation are presence of fresh blood, absence of feces, tension band, distended small bowel, distended cecum, or a mass among small bowels. Ileus and peracute enteritis can be easily confused with jejunal obstruction. Usually, the small bowel will be distended primarily with fluids and easily palpable per rectum. Tension bands may also be palpated. In volvulus, intestines are severely distended with gas occupying the pelvic cavity. Intussusception is difficult to identify precisely but usually is suspected if a hard mass is felt among distended small bowels. Jejunal hemorrhage syndrome (JHS) might have a similar rectal examination finding except that the rectum is filled with ripe raspberry-like feces in variable quantity. Animals with enteritis may have a fever and show other clinical signs or laboratory results compatible with it (ie, leukopenia). Finally, the heart rate is a good indicator of the severity of the condition but should be correlated with other findings. A cow with mildly distended small bowel and a heart rate of 80 beats per minute (bpm) does not need immediate assistance. However, a cow with a distended organ and heart rate of 100 bpm and dehydrated needs immediate assistance.",

If the animal is standing, the decision is often based on surgeon\u2019s training and experience. If the animal is weak, the surgery is performed with the animal in left lateral recumbency. Sternal recumbency is an option but the animal must be secured to prevent it from standing during the surgery (Fig. 2\n). Doing the surgery on a secured recumbent animal has the main advantage of doing the manipulation without worrying if the animal lies down, kicks, or moves constantly while suturing the intestines. However, securing an animal on lateral recumbency is difficult in a field setting. Moreover, exteriorization of bowels is more difficult on a laterally recumbent animal.",

Flunixin meglumin, ketoprofen, butorphanol, meloxicam, or ketamine stun3 is frequently used for standing gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in cattle. If the surgery is performed standing, sedation must be used cautiously so the animal will not lie down. The authors rarely use sedation unless the behavior of the animal is aggressive or will prevent safe manipulation of the bowels. Broad spectrum antibiotics must be given before the surgery and repeated during the procedure if it lasts longer than 2 hours. Regional block or paravertebral block is preferred, allowing the surgeon to extend the incision at his or her convenience. If the animal is in shock and there is electrolytes imbalance, fluids are given before and during the procedure. Blood transfusion must be considered in some severe cases of JHS. Avoid any high-volume oral fluids if the abdomen is distended.",

            "text": "A cow has a short mesentery, therefore, traction on it is painful and the animal may go down at any moment. This short mesentery precludes adequate exteriorization of some segments of the small bowel. Only the portion to be resected should be exteriorized to avoid excessive traction and contamination during the resection-anastomosis (Fig. 3\n). Infiltration of 2% lidocaine into the mesentery where resection is planned may decrease the pain of traction. The mesenteric vessels (arteries and veins) are ligated using mass ligation with absorbable suture material (United States Pharmacopeia [USP] 3 chromic gut, USP 1 polyglactin 910), being sure not to compromise the blood supply to the intestine to be preserved. Mass ligation is required because cattle do not have a well-defined arcuate vascular anatomy (as do horses) and the fatty mesentery renders vessel identification impossible.4 The sutures are placed in an overlapping pattern such that double ligation of the vessels is accomplished (Fig. 4A). This technique may be performed rapidly. However, it is impossible to effectively ligate all the vessels. It will be completed on complete resection of the intestinal segment. Stapling instrumentation is highly unreliable for occlusion of mesenteric vessels because of the large amount of fat normally found in the intestinal mesentery of cattle. Ligasure (Covidien, Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is an electrocautery device that will seal vessels through a specially designed forceps. It seals vessels up to 7 mm in diameter. It is efficient and safe but expensive to use. Moreover, the machine is not meant to be used in a field situation.",

            "text": "After completion of mesentery ligation and transection, Doyen intestinal forceps are used to occlude the lumen of the normal and abnormal bowel (Fig. 4B\u2013D). When exteriorization allows it, thirty centimeters of healthy bowel adjacent to the affected portion are also resected. The proximal segment of bowel is carefully exteriorized to its maximum length and the Doyen forceps are removed. Distended orad intestine can be decompressed through the enterectomy site with special care to avoid contamination of the incision or abdomen with ingesta. This procedure will lessen the severity of postoperative ileus and shorten convalescence. The 2 segments of intestine are reunited by end-to-end or side-to-side anastomosis with an absorbable suture material (USP 2\u20130 for adult, USP 3\u20130 to 4\u20130 for calves with polyglactin 910 or polydioxanone) using a single or 2-layer suture pattern.5 A simple full-thickness, continuous suture provides better apposition and less lumen diameter reduction (Fig. 5\n). The anastomosis is performed in 2 to 3 overlapping simple continuous suture lines, each placed in one-half of one-third of the circumference, so that a purse-string effect is not created. A 2-layer technique consists of a simple continuous suture involving the mucosa and submucosa, followed by a Cushing or Lembert pattern. The initial suture line should be placed at the mesenteric attachment because this is the most likely site for leakage to occur. Some surgeons prefer using a full-thickness, simple interrupted suture when segments to anastomose are of significantly different diameter (Fig. 6\n). After the anastomosis, the mesentery is sutured in a continuous pattern with a USP 0 absorbable suture material (see Fig. 6). The affected intestine is thoroughly washed with sterile isotonic fluids, checked for the presence of leakage, and replaced into the abdomen. Carboxymethylcellulose gel can be applied over the anastomosis site to prevent adhesions.",

Although the stapling technique was faster (TA 55 with 3.5 mm staples), enterotomy suture with 1-layer interrupted Gambee technique resulted in fewer adhesions and thickening of the intestinal wall. At 13-weeks postsurgery, the lumen diameter reduction was similar between both suture techniques.6 As previously described, a simple continuous suture followed by a Lembert or Cushing will provide a watertight suture with minimal lumen reduction.",

This is a surgical condition and diagnosis is confirmed during the laparotomy. Surgical findings are an enlarged abomasum and cranial duodenum. The sigmoid flexure is severely distended with gas and a volvulus can be palpated at its root, close to the neck of the gall bladder, on the visceral part of the liver (Fig. 9\n). The volvulus is reduced and cranial duodenal content is milked through the flexure to ensure that it is functional.

After the initial signs of abdominal pain subside, affected cattle become progressively lethargic, recumbent, and show apparent depression.

In the authors\u2019 experiences, an intussusception may be present for 48 hours or more in adult cattle without intestinal distention being found during rectal palpation. It depends on its location and the severity of the obstruction. Some animals will still pass a certain amount of feces.

Surgical correction may proceed after the patient has been assessed as a suitable candidate. Most of these animals will have some degree of peritonitis. Broad spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative or gram-positive, as well as anaerobic, bacteria must be administered preoperatively. The regimen can be adjusted postoperatively related to surgical findings. Intra-abdominal surgical manipulations are painful demand appropriate preoperative analgesia. NSAIDs are given preoperatively, along with butorphanol (0.05 mg/kg S.C.). Right paralumbar fossa exploratory laparotomy is the surgical approach of choice for treatment of intussusception. Most small intestines of cattle have a short mesentery, preventing adequate exteriorization of the intussusception through a ventral midline incision. Also, the attachments of the greater omentum limit exposure with this approach. Most often, diagnostic exploratory laparotomy is performed with the cow standing after regional anesthesia. Tension on the mesentery of the small intestine results in pain and cattle may attempt to lie down during the procedure. Of 35 cattle having standing, right paralumbar fossa laparotomy for resection of intussusception, 14% became recumbent and 26% attempted to become recumbent during the surgery.21 Preoperative planning should include anticipation of this possibility. When intussusception is suspected and the animal is of high perceived economic value, right paralumbar fossa celiotomy may be performed with the patient under general anesthesia and in left lateral recumbency. The intussusception may be more difficult to elevate through the incision in recumbent cattle because the fluid-filled bowel gravitates away from the surgical site.

Cattle that are thought to be at great risk of becoming recumbent during surgery should be placed under general anesthesia, in left lateral recumbency, and the laparotomy performed through the right paralumbar fossa. The presence of the volvulus and the direction of the twist are assessed by palpating the root of the mesentery and, in the case of jejunoileal flange volvulus, following this ventrally to the location of the twist. The intestinal mass is gently derotated, being careful not to cause rupture of the viscera. This procedure may require exteriorization of various portions of the intestinal mass. After correction of the volvulus, the intestinal tract should be examined for evidence of nonviable bowel. If the intestine is compromised (arterial thrombosis, blackened serosa, friable wall of the affected segment, mural edema), then intestinal resection and anastomosis is indicated (see previous discussion of intussusception).

Abomasal hairballs may cause pyloric obstruction, which leads to rapid onset of abdominal distention. The authors prefer to perform a right paramedian or ventral paracostal laparotomy to exteriorize the abomasum. An abomasotomy is performed along the greater curvature of the abomasum, the foreign bodies removed, and the abomasum is closed with absorbable synthetic suture material (eg, 0 polydioxanone, polyglycolic 910) using 2 layers of an inverting suture pattern. When obstruction of the duodenum, jejunum, or spiral colon is suspected, a right paralumbar fossa celiotomy and exploration of the abdomen should be performed. The foreign body is found by exteriorizing a segment of normal or distended intestine and tracing this segment oral or aboral, respectively, until the obstruction is found. This segment of intestine is exteriorized from the abdomen, isolated using moistened surgical towels, and an enterotomy performed (Fig. 18\n). After removal of the foreign body, the enterotomy is closed with absorbable suture material (eg, 2\u20130 polydioxanone, polyglactin 910) using 2 lines of an inverting suture pattern. The enterotomy may be closed transversely to maximize the lumen of the affected segment of intestine and minimize the tension endured by the suture line during contraction of the intestinal wall.

In 19 animals, the ingesta was broken down and massaged aborally into the caecum. In a few animals, typhlotomy or enterotomy was necessary to decompress and remove the impaction. A side-to-side ileocecal anastomosis had to be performed in 6 animals to prevent recurrence. The short-term and long-term prognosis was considered good.",
