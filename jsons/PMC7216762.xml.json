As the\nsituation has progressed, the focus of scientists and their ability to undertake most\nexperiments has been limited to facilitating physical distancing. Still, research addressing\nvaried aspects of diagnosing, treating, and mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is not only\ncontinuing but accelerating with the goal of reducing loss of life. Chemical biologists have\nintegral contributions to make: Chemical tools can address challenges in biology, which is\nwhat is required to understand and mitigate SARS-CoV-2. Given that Italy is now under\ntremendous stress from COVID-19, we asked an Italian scientist to discuss the strategies\nthat academic and industrial laboratories in Italy are pursuing to limit the impact of the\nvirus both on their research and on society. We hope that this perspective along with that\nof our Chinese colleagues will provide insight into the important scientific advancements\nand the human aspects of advancing science in the face of a rapidly growing pandemic.",

Of special\nconcern, in general, and for me personally, is the situation in the province of\nBergamo, with almost 4000 cases (3993) and many fatalities (460,\nalmost 12%), where two small towns not far from where I was born and raised are paying a\nbrutal toll. Of little comfort is the knowledge that the majority of infected people (up\nto 80%) are likely asymptomatic and go by undetected, as revealed by a study conducted in\nthe small village of Vo\u2019 Euganeo (not far from Padua), where all\n3000 residents were tested after lockdown.2 These results mirror those\nrecently published by Li and co-workers.3",

In parallel, volunteers will be tested for\nthe presence, in the respiratory tract, of the virus itself. This will lead, in the first\nplace, to an understanding of whether the virus had been circulating long before the\noutbreak of the epidemic (allowing the immune system to generate a long-term immune\nresponse in some individuals) and, second, to a cross-checking of the results of swabs and\ndetection of false negatives. The results will need to be interpreted cautiously. Indeed,\nviral RNA quantification is an established diagnostic tool, but the interpretation of the\npresence of specific antibodies is still under debate, as it is currently unknown whether\nthey will confer long-term immunity against future infections. The protocol for safe\nsample collection (timing of individual appointments and access to the dedicated location)\nhas been designed in collaboration with the Italian Association of Blood Donors (AVIS).\nThe call for voluntary participation to all the people working at the university\nregistered more than 1500 volunteers in less than 24 h.
