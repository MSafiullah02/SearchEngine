In 1994, a 2-tiered antibody testing strategy was adopted in which a first-tier test (usually enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was designed to be very sensitive in detecting new cases, and a second-tier test (Western blot) was intended as a more specific confirmatory step to rule out false positives [3] . However, serologic tests have been hampered by technical and biological shortcomings, the greatest being a time lag for the host to make detectable antibody by current tests. The other biologic hurdle is that a single antibody test can only indicate exposure, not active infection [4] or reinfection. The development of sensitive tests capable of directly detecting the organism in body fluids has proven challenging.",

The participants were from industry, academia, and government, with extensive experience in clinical and laboratory aspects of Lyme disease and other infectious diseases, as well as participants with regulatory experience in the clearance of diagnostic tests. The emphasis of the meeting was on diagnostic testing platforms for early Lyme disease, since current serologic tests are insensitive during the first several weeks of infection. There was no intent to take a vote, advocate for one test product over another, or reach a consensus during the meeting; rather, there was discussion of research findings that support or challenge particular diagnostic concepts. What emerged was a recognition that improved approaches to serologic testing were now available [4] and that the technology for direct detection of bacterial proteins or DNA has advanced to the point that it is evaluable in Lyme disease. If the technology meets scientific rigor, these tests could become future diagnostic assays.",

The challenge to the 1994 Dearborn Conference [3] participants was to develop testing and interpretive guidelines that would standardize serologic testing for diagnostic purposes. The guidelines are geared to assess exposure to B. burgdorferi through the patient's antibody response to infection rather than direct detection of nucleic acid or protein from the microbe.

Culture of the pathogen, microbial nucleic acid, or protein may be detected in skin biopsies of erythema migrans (EM) before the development of a positive serology.

Although some large commercial laboratories use mass spectrometry for diagnostic purposes (not Lyme disease), this methodology can be used to identify and validate the specific antibody-antigen complex so that simpler assays can be developed for use in routine laboratory settings or perhaps even closer to the point of care. In addition, emerging antigen concentration and enrichment methods [14, 15] have the potential to address another likely limitation-B. burgdorferi-specific antigens are probably in very low abundance in body fluids. Throughout the B. burgdorferi infection, there are few circulating organisms, and the organism burden in affected organs is low. Concentration methods can be categorized as follows: removal of solute or water [16] , electrophoretic or chromatographic separation [17] , and affinity capture [18] [19] [20] .

Many pathogens are easily detected using NAATs, especially with high enhancement or enrichment methods when present. Many polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been geared to analyze small volumes of blood, plasma, or other sample types. In Lyme disease, outside the EM in skin, the infectious agent resides in very low numbers in tissue and body fluids, and standard PCR methods, as applied to B. burgdorferi detection, have suffered from poor sensitivity, especially in blood and cerebrospinal fluid [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . An illustrative strategy to increase PCR sensitivity without diminishing specificity is to start with a larger specimen volume and/ or use target enrichment methods [26] . It appears possible to detect B. burgdorferi in the blood with higher sensitivity [27] in early Lyme disease. In addition, there are a variety of PCR-based assays in development that use unconventional signal detection or amplification methods [27, 28] , with the potential to achieve a limit of detection (LOD) that is substantially lower than with standard PCR methods.",

These infections have many genomic copies detectable by methodology geared to small volumes of blood or plasma. In contrast, Lyme disease has very low microbe numbers in the majority of clinical samples. With enhancement and enrichment methods, detection of B. burgdorferi in the blood is increasingly possible. Multiple displacement amplification [26] and similar strategies in which DNA is exponentially amplified by isothermal amplification increases the yield of B. burgdorferi by at least 200 times above normal [27] . This makes a PCR detection assay far more sensitive. In other studies, the sensitivity of PCR-based assays was increased, on the order of 16 000-fold, by combining 3 consecutive methods [27] . Similar to the approach used for blood cultures for sepsis where multiple large volumes of blood are taken, the first step was to start with a larger volume of whole blood, 1.25 mL (more than 0.5 mL of plasma or serum are often requested by clinical laboratories). The second step was to increase the relative content of B. burgdorferi compared to human or other microbial DNA by using targeted isothermal amplification. In vitro experiments resulted in a 200-to 2000-fold increase in the targeted DNA. In a set of clinical EM samples, the number of cases detected was 7-fold greater than without this step. The third step that increased sensitivity with 100% specificity was the use of multiple primers. It should be noted that there appear to be skin-restricted genotypes, which may be the reason for negative results in blood. We should also consider enrichment or concentration of a pathogen to increase the target concentration for nucleic acid extraction followed by PCR analysis.",

However, B. burgdorferi is particularly challenging, in part, because it is present in low abundance in circulating fluids and because it has an unusual genome [32] . The approximately 1.7 Mb Bbl. genome is AT-rich (approximately 30%), and nearly half of it consists of linear and circular plasmids. Borrelia burgdorferi isolates an average of 17 such plasmids, with up to 21 for the B31 type strain [33] . Thus, Borrelia genomes are among the most complex and challenging bacterial human-pathogenic genomes to sequence and analyze. These difficult-to-sequence plasmids carry antigen-encoding genes and are often required for propagation of the bacteria in ticks and/or mammals. The recent development of long-read sequencing technology [34] (eg, Pacific Biosciences), in combination with the use of HTS technologies with relatively very low sequencing error rates (eg, Illumina Novae or MiSeq platforms) [34] [35] [36] , has allowed resolution of the repeated sequences that are the hallmark of Borrelia genomes and of other sequencing challenges commonly found in the critically important Borrelia plasmids.",
