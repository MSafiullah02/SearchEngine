In this study, we found a high prevalence (64.3%) of MNV in various breeding colonies of immunocompromised, transgenic and wild-type mouse lines. All mice survived infection with no signs of clinical disease. Faeces samples were collected from animals housed in two separate laboratory mouse colonies in Berlin, Germany, and screened using quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequences of 3 novel MNV strains. Furthermore, we sequenced two subgenomic regions within open reading frames (ORFs) 1 and 2 that are suitable for genotyping. Sequence analysis of the full-length and partial genomes obtained from naturally infected mice yielded valuable data on genetic diversity of murine noroviruses. The discordance of genotype affiliation of some MNVs shown in ORF1 and ORF2 suggests intertypic recombination events in vivo.",

MNV is the first known norovirus to infect small animals. Sequence analysis designated the virus as a member of the new genogroup V within the genus Norovirus. In contrast to the lack of a culture system for human noroviruses, the murine norovirus replicates in cultured haematopoietic cells. This provides an excellent model system to study norovirus biology and pathogenesis [32, 33] .",

            "text": "Noroviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the family Caliciviridae. These viruses are the major cause of outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. The viral genome of human noroviruses is approximately 7.5 kb in length and contains three overlapping open reading frames. ORF1 encodes the nonstructural polyprotein, which is processed by the viral 3C-like protease into several functional proteins, including NTPase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [3, 26] . ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid protein (VP1) and a small basic structural protein (VP2), respectively. The VP1 protein possesses two domains: the P (protruding, P1 and P2) domain and the S domain, which forms the icosahedral shell of the capsid [27] . Most of the cellular interactions and immune recognition features are thought to be located in the P2 sub-domain, which is exposed at the viral surface and shows the highest degree of sequence diversity within the genome [7, 12] . VP2 is associated with upregulation of VP1 expression in cis and stabilization of VP1 in the virus structure [4] . Although varying in size, the murine norovirus exhibits an identical genomic organisation [30] .",

Compared to each other, the three fragments obtained from S25, S27 and S28 revealed more than 99% nucleotide sequence identities. The fragments were analyzed with SimPlot software by comparing the sequences to potentially parental strains as described elsewhere [21] . Figure 3a shows the results obtained by comparison of the sequence from isolate S28 to M21 and S36 as putative parental strains. S28 is distant from M21 within the ORF1 polymerase region except for the 3 0 end, which corresponds to the conserved ORF1-ORF2 junction. S28 showed a closer association to S36 within ORF1, with a similarity of 96-99%, which confirms the clustering shown in Fig. 2 . In contrast, the S28 sequence was only distantly related to S36 within the capsid region, while on the other hand, the distance to M21 was less than 5%, supporting the relationship within ORF2.",

To investigate the prevalence of MNV in German research mice, we established a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay. The frequency determined in this study (64.3%) was much higher than expected based on the data from serological testing (22.1%) [13] . This fact could be attributed to local endemic differences. In addition, it is possible that not all infected mice develop immunity. Time-related reduction of antibody titers or insufficient cross-reactivity may also play a role. Studies concerning the immunity against human noroviruses have indicated that immunity seems to be short-lived and protection, furthermore, is strainspecific [23, 25] . The potential to induce persistent infections in mice [14] , the high degree of environmental stability [6] , and the faecal-oral route of transmission [33] all could have contributed to the high prevalence. None of the mice investigated here showed any symptoms of disease, confirming the observations regarding infection of mice with MNV2-4 [14] . This certainly contributed to the unnoticed spread of the virus. In contrast, MNV-1 infection has been shown to be associated with lethal disease in severely immunodeficient mice [17, 31] . It remains unclear if the pathogenesis is dependent on the mouse genotype or specific MNV strains. In this respect, further studies are required to evaluate if MNV infection of laboratory mice affects independent experiments unrelated to research on MNV.",

            "text": "Like human noroviruses, the present sequence data indicate that murine norovirus strains are also genetically diverse and can, therefore, be subdivided in genetic clusters. The MNV strains analysed in the present study were classified into 8 genetic clusters. The cluster pattern is comparable to the diversity of the sapoviruses (SV), another genus within the family Caliciviridae [11, 29] . These data suggest that MNVs, like SVs, could be evolutionary more stable than human noroviruses. Published MNV1-4 complete nucleotide sequences are prototypes of clusters 1 to 4, whereas M21, S36, S74 and S99 would be the reference sequences for clusters 5 to 8 (Fig. 1a) . However, the divergences of partial ORF1 and ORF2 sequences of MNV isolates investigated here reveal a high degree of variability among murine noroviruses.",

            "text": "It is noticeable that the genetic relatedness of MNV isolates is not always equivalent when analyzing different genome regions. The phylogenetic analysis presented here demonstrated that recombination events might have occurred between murine norovirus strains (Fig. 2) . Analysis of the sequences obtained from isolate S28 by a nucleotide identity window search indicated a phylogenetic shift (Fig.  3a) . Furthermore, reference strain MNV-4 clustered differentially (Fig. 3b) . In addition to the high error rate of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase due to the lack of proofreading activity, recombination also contributes to the diversity and the evolution of RNA viruses [34] . Intertypic recombination within human SVs as well as bovine and human NVs has been demonstrated by comparison of complete genome sequences and incongruent clustering of sub-genomic sequence fragments from different regions [1, 5, 10, 11, 18, 28] . Breakpoint analysis of recombinant viruses revealed the ORF1-ORF2 overlap as a recombination site. Our data confirm that a putative crossover point of MNV recombinants (Fig. 3) is located within 100 nucleotides (Fig. 1b) of this region. This junction region is highly conserved, suggesting that the recombination might be driven by homologous RNA interaction, comparable to picornaviruses and coronaviruses, where the ''copy choice'' model of RNA recombination is preferred [20, 22] . Occurrence of subgenomic RNA during replication of MNV supports this model [17] . Additionally, RNA promoter regions often contain stem-loop structures [16] . We found evidence of such structures within the highly conserved junction of MNV strains.",
