The principle of this method for the determination of binding constants is to exploit the changes in the migration time of the complexed sample in the background electrolyte containing the complexation agent. After adding SARS 3CL proteinase to background solution (BGS), the octapeptide inhibitor can interact with the proteinase. The equilibrium represented by the following equations assumed that a 1:1 complex is formed:(1)OP+3CLP\u21ccKbOP-3CLP\n(2)Kb=[OP-3CLP][OP][3CLP],where OP, 3CLP, and OP-3CLP are the octapeptide, SARS 3CL proteinase, and complex, respectively. K\nb is the binding constant for Eq. (1). As pointed out by Yang et al. [20], the capacity factor k, which is used as an indicator to describe the relationship between retention time and mass distribution equilibrium in chromatography, can be used here to describe the migration behaviors of the active compounds in CE. Moreover, the addition of SARS 3CL proteinase in the BGS is applied as a pseudo-stationary phase. Based on our previous work [21], [22], the binding constant can be measured according to the following equation:(3)k=\u03d5[OP]s[OP]m0(1+Kb[3CLP]),where \u03d5 is phase ratio, [OP]s is the concentration of the octapeptide in stationary phase, and [OP]m0 is the initial concentration of the octapeptide without the addition of SARS 3CL proteinase in the mobile phase.",

            "text": "We demonstrated previously that the dimer of SARS 3CL proteinase should be the biologically functional form and plays a major role in catalysis. In addition, one monomer of SARS 3CL proteinase binds to the other one specifically at the N-terminal interface [19], [23]. To compete with the dimeric interaction of the proteinase, the octapeptide inhibitor was designed according to the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of SARS 3CL proteinase. Because the concentrations of SARS 3CL proteinase were less than 0.2 mg ml\u22121 in the current experimental conditions, the main form of the proteinase was thought to be monomer. The binding constant of the octapeptide with SARS 3CL proteinase was measured to be 2.44 \u00d7 104\n M\u22121 at 20 \u00b0C, and the dissociation constant of the dimer of the proteinase was estimated to be 100 \u03bcM [19]; thus, the octapeptide inhibitor can bind to the monomer of the proteinase competitively and can prevent the dimerization effectively. Moreover, the interactions between the octapeptide and the two common proteins, BSA and OVA, were studied as a negative control at the same conditions to avoid the influence of nonspecific absorption. Compared with Fig. 2, the plots of BSA were similar (Fig. 3\nA), with the binding constants being calculated as 8.01 \u00d7 103\n M\u22121 at 20 \u00b0C and 8.20 \u00d7 103\n M\u22121 at 37 \u00b0C, whereas the plots of OVA were random (Fig. 3B). The results showed that the octapeptide could interact with BSA weakly but could not bind to OVA and that there should be a specific binding between the octapeptide inhibitor and SARS 3CL proteinase.",

A simple and reliable CE method with very low sample consumption was applied to study the interaction between SARS 3CL proteinase and an octapeptide interface inhibitor. The binding constant was determined by the changes in the migration time of the octapeptide inhibitor at different concentrations of SARS 3CL proteinase in the running buffers. The octapeptide was shown to bind to SARS 3CL proteinase competitively, with binding constant K\nb values of 2.44 \u00d7 104\n M\u22121 at 20 \u00b0C and 2.11 \u00d7 104\n M\u22121 at 37 \u00b0C. Analysis of the thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy change (\u0394H) and entropy change (\u0394S), indicated that hydrophobic interaction might play a major role, along with electrostatic force, in the binding processes. The ACE method should be widely applicable for large-scale ligand screening against protein targets.",
