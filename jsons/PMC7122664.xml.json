            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was formally found as a novel emerging virus infection in rural regions in Henan and Hubei Provinces in Peoples\u2019 Republic of China in 2009 and was reported in 2011 (Ministry of Health of People\u2019s Republic China 2010; Yu et al. 2011). However, it was later recognized that the first case was discovered in Anhui Province in the autumn of 2006 retrospectively (Zhang et al. 2008). At that time, these patients were improperly diagnosed with human granulocytic anaplasmois (HGA), due to similar clinical presentation (e.g. fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, etc). Later, as the retrospective investigation was conducted, it was revealed that most of the patients suffered from SFTS, but not from HGA (Liu et al. 2012a). Successively, in 2007, multiple patients presenting fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia had emerged in local hospitals in Henan Province, especially around Xinyang City. A patient\u2019s family member reported the disease to the Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The center, then, conducted a special epidemiological investigation. Based on the investigation, the relatively specific disease was found to be caused by a novel bunyavirus, which was later identified as SFTSV (Xu et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2014a). Since then, many epidemiological investigations were conducted in China resulting in obtaining various epidemiological findings. In this article, epidemiology of SFTS in China is described in detail by description to assess distributions over time, place, and person, based on these epidemiological investigations.",

After the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in 2003, the Chinese government made the Law of Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease and improved its public health disease surveillance system, taking advantage of web-based system to build an integrated, effective, and reliable disease reporting system over the paper-based reporting system (Wang et al. 2017a). In the disease surveillance system, there are three major components (World Health Organization Western Pacific Region 2017; Vlieg et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 1998):National Disease Reporting System (NDRS); that is, notifiable disease surveillance. This surveillance involves the whole population living in all counties, prefectures, and provinces in Mainland China. There are 38 notifiable infectious diseases, which are classified into 3 groups (Group A, B, and C). Groups A and B represent categories of diseases with high risk of causing outbreaks or that are likely to result in rapid spread once an outbreak occured. Group A diseases should be reported within 2 h of diagnosis, while Group B and C diseases should be within 24 h.Group A: plague, choleraGroup B: SARS, measles, rabies, malaria, syphilis, etc.Group C: influenza, rubella, hand-foot-mouth disease, etc.\nNationwide Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs); that is, sentinel disease surveillance. This surveillance is used when high-quality data are required about particular diseases that cannot be obtained through the notifiable disease surveillance (World Health Organization n.d.). The sentinel system involves only a limited network of carefully selected reporting sites. In China, approximately 150 reporting units are randomly selected from all medical facilities in 30 province-level divisions, which covers for about 1% of the entire facilities. The information of patients are obtained from these selected facilities.Surveillance system for specific infectious diseases, occupational diseases, food-borne diseases, etc.\n",

SFTS has been added to the list of national reported diseases that requires reporting within 24 h as regulated by the national guideline for prevention and control of SFTS (Ding et al. 2014a). SFTS cases were detected in hospitals and reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at prefectural, municipal, provincial, and national levels through the electronically operating China Information System for Diseases Control and Prevention (CISDCP) (Liu et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2016).",

The geographical distribution has also been gradually expanding to date (Zhan et al. 2017a). Although the reasons are not known, the number of cases has increased and the geographical distribution has expanded. Several factors may contribute the epidemiological evidence. First, the number of SFTS patients might has truly increased and the SFTS-endemic areas might has spread more widely due to the spread of the animal hosts and/or vectors. Second, medical staffs might have become aware of the disease and find more cases through intensive education and trainings. Third, systems including disease monitoring and detection capacity of the pathogen likely have improved (Sun et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017b).",

From spring to summer, the outdoor activity or field work of the farmers such as picking tea and clearing weeds increased, subsequently elevating the potential risk of exposure to the putative vectors. Outdoor activities in rural areas, such as camping and hiking, are also a potential risk factor for exposure to vectors (Liu et al. 2014a). Additionally, during the same period, a tick density and activity also increased and absorb their hosts\u2019 blood in order to grow and proliferate between May and August (Xu et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2014b; Sun et al. 2014). In fact, it showed that the SFTSV infections were highly correlated with the tick density curve, and the peak of tick density occurred prior to the peak of human infection cases (Wang et al. 2017b; Du et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2012c).",

The female-to-male ratio was slightly higher than 1, but no obvious difference was found (Liu et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2014b; Zhan et al. 2017a). Age distribution demonstrated that the annual notifications increased gradually from younger to older age groups (Liu et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2014c). Several pediatric cases under the age of 18 were reported, and they remained to be rarer compared with adult cases (Zhu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2014). This may be because the child cases show relatively milder clinical symptoms and better prognosis than those of the elderly cases (Zhu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2014). The high notification of elderly patients may be due to the physiological factors related to ageing, such as decreased in immune function and the presence of comorbidities with chronic diseases. However, this may also be associated with demographic characteristics of residents in wooded or mountainous areas, where SFTS cases occur (Sun et al. 2014). Generally, the younger generation attend to the main commerce and industrial work in urban area in China, instead of agriculture in rural area. On the other hand, the older generation attend to farming or stock-farming activities (growing various crops, cultivating fields, cutting glasses, and breeding animals, etc), especially tea-picking activity, which was carried out by elderly women (Liu et al. 2014c). These specific social factors may contribute to population distribution in China.\n",

            "text": "Occupation and habit are associated with SFTS suffering. Because SFTS is a tick-borne disease, occupation and habit with frequently exposure to ticks seem to be potential risk factors. Agricultural tea pluckers, farmers, forest workers, and residents who live in rural areas, where is wooded and hilly areas, are the occupational risk factors (Liu et al. 2014a; Liu et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2012). In a seroepidemiological survey conducted in non-endemic areas of Anhui Province, multivariate analysis revealed that the odds ratio for tea pluckers was 3.7 folds higher than non-tea pluckers (95% CI: 1.033\u201313.582) with a statistical significance (Huang et al. 2017). Several descriptive reports revealed that farmers in endemic area accounted for around 85% or more of SFTS cases, and those residing in mountainous areas did for 95% or more. They might be a major high-risk population (Ding et al. 2014a; Zhan et al. 2017a; Liu et al. 2014c). In the case-control study, the odds ratio for workers in the field was 2.3 folds higher (95% CI: 1.3\u20134.0) in the cases than the controls. In the other studies on seroprevalence, odds ratios for farming, farm work time (>3\u20136 h a day), and grass mowing were also significantly higher (OR: 4.919, 95% CI: 1.269\u201319.058; OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.49\u20137.05; OR: 14.05, 95% CI: 5.53\u201335.70, respectively). To the contrary, a case-control study suggested that there was no significant difference in occupations between the cases and controls (Xing et al. 2017). Probably, farming would be a potential risk factor, but it has still been unclear whether farmers have truly a higher risk or not. The majority of workers in rural area are farmers, which may influence the conclusions. In addition to these factors, one review article described that tourists, who might be more susceptible, were also often suffered to SFTS (Hu et al. 2016).",

In the case-control study focusing on the detail tick-exposures were classified into four groups of \u201csee ticks\u201d, \u201ccontact ticks\u201d, \u201ccatch ticks\u201d, or \u201cbitten by ticks\u201d. The multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis of tick exposure sources showed that \u201cbitten by environmental ticks\u201d and \u201ccontact with cattle ticks\u201d including touching ticks, catching ticks, or bitten by ticks, were the potential risk factors for acquiring SFTSV infection.

However, it was also reported that tick bites was only noticed by approximately 15% of the cases (Ding et al. 2014a; Sun et al. 2016). The reason may be that SFTS cases usually do not notice whether they had a history of being bitten by ticks or not, because tick bites are commonly painless. It is possible that history of tick bites might be under-reporting; therefore, it is assumed that tick bites would be more important potential risk factor than expected (Ding et al. 2014a).",

To investigate the role of domestic and wild animals as reservoir hosts, a study was conducted in Laizhou and Penglai counties of Shandong Province, demonstrating that SFTSV RNA was detected in the serum samples of sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, and chickens, ranging from 1.7% to 5.3% (Niu et al. 2013). Besides, SFTS-specific antibodies were also detected in a wide range of animals, including goats, sheep, cattles, dogs, pigs, chickens, geese, rodents, and hedgehogs (Niu et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014b; Ding et al. 2014c). Epidemiological studies have provided the knowledge on the risk of contact of humans with animals. In the descriptive study, the number of bred domestic animals and exposure to a mouse was 20 (31%) and 37 (57%) among 65 SFTS cases, respectively (Sun et al. 2014). In the case-control study, it was suggested that cat and cattle ownership was a potential risk factor; adjusted odds ratios were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2\u20133.9) and 2.6 (95% CI: 1.4\u20134.8), respectively (Ding et al. 2014a). According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis in another case-control study, the odds ratio of breeding domestic animal was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.0\u20133.0) (Sun et al. 2016). In the seroprevalence study focusing on Jiangsu Province, a multiple variable logistic regression analysis showed that raising goats, raising cattles, and grazing were potential risk factors for SFTSV infection, whose odds ratios were 7.27 (95% CI: 1.29\u201340.89), 11.51 (95% CI: 2.18\u201360.67), and 40.154 (95% CI: 6.385\u2013252.530), respectively (Xing et al. 2017; Li et al. 2014a; Liang et al. 2014). Additionally, density of cattle was found to be the independent potential risk factor for the presences of SFTS in Hubei Province, whose adjusted notification rate ratio was 2.03 (95% CI: 1.38\u20133.00) (Liu et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017b).",
