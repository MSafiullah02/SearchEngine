As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual's right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation. We then interrogate the practicality of currently available approaches by applying them to a series of hypothetical cases. There are currently no 'neat' or practicable solutions to the problem of lawfully isolating patients on mental health units, and we discuss the myriad issues with both mental health and public health law approaches to the problem. We conclude by making some suggestions to policymakers.",

We want to emphasise in light of this, that it may be justifiable for infection control policies to necessitate a set period of time for isolation on the basis of clinical judgement even in case of a negative test result. This would have the effect that review of the need for isolation could only meaningfully happen on a relatively infrequent basis, 4 e.g. initially after seven or fourteen days. Infection control policies should allow for the least possible restriction on individual liberty that adequately mitigates riskthough the science and ethics of this balancing exercise fall outside the scope of this paper. However, if these policies allowed scope to terminate seclusion early on the basis of test results and clinical presentation, this would underline the importance of regular review of those subject to isolation, as well as the availability of viral testing for mental health patients.",

It is legitimate only in the very short term, and so could not be relied upon for the periods of time required for respiratory isolation.

The Act's widely interpretable definition of 'mental disorder' is given in s.1 as \"any disorder or disability of the mind\", making exceptions for learning disability (unless \"associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct\"), and dependence on alcohol or drugs. The 'nature' of a mental disorder relates to what is known about its character, usually 19 Such principles have been recommended by the independent Review of the Act: (Wessely et al., 2018) . 20 The CoP provides statutory guidance to professionals undertaking duties under the MHA 1983, and is prepared by the Secretary of State for Health in accordance with s.118 of the Act. Where the word 'should' is used, departures from the Code, if subsequently scrutinised in Court, will need to have been made with 'sufficiently convincing justification'. 21 MHA 1983 CoP 1.1. 22 MHA1983 s.2 2(2) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f over time and in relation to the environment or treatment.

However, the logic of the judgment does suggest that, especially if seclusion in isolation is carefully monitored, and the impact upon the patient minimised, the line may not always be crossed into the situation of an additional deprivation of liberty. This is to say that the manner in which providers safeguard Article 5 rights, e.g. using seclusion provisions of the MHA CoP, or otherwise, may be determinative of whether or not that person has been deprived of residual liberty.

The Official Solicitor raised concerns as to whether the restrictions in this case were compliant with Article 8 on the basis that they were insufficiently prescriptive, carried insufficient safeguards, and lacked validation and oversight by a public body. To address these concerns the parties agreed a 52-page policy document that included specific policies governing searches of the man and his room, as well as monitoring of his telephone calls and correspondence. Additional layers of scrutiny were also agreed between the parties, including provision for the NHS Trust to periodically review each separate policy and receive monthly reports. The Official Solicitor submitted that the agreed policies and procedures put beyond doubt any question of compliance with Article 8 ECHR. The care home, which was said to have agreed the policies out of benign concern for the man, argued that the policies were not in fact necessary to legitimise the restrictions. This was not accepted by Mostyn J, who held (at paragraphs 20-21): \"\u2026 not every case where there is some interference with Art 8 rights in the context of a deprivation of liberty authorised under the 2005 Act needs to have in place detailed policies with oversight by a public authority. Sometimes, particularly where the issue is one-off (such as authorising an operation), an order from the Court of Protection will suffice and will provide a sufficien t basis in law. But where there is going to be a long-term restrictive regime accompanied by invasive monitoring of the kind with which I am concerned, it seems to me that policies overseen by the applicable NHS Trust and the CQC akin to those which have been agreed here are likely to be necessary if serious doubts as to Article 8 compliance are to be avoided.",

It could be argued that if a detained patient were not to be informed that they would be made to isolate should they not comply with isolation (in an attempt to avoid coercion), that they could voluntarily self-isolate. However, it is clear that this faces similar ethical difficulties insofar as their choice is poorly informed, and the validity of their consent somewhat artificial. 50 At least, in respect of the loss of capacity, as the law currently stands.

Seclusion in this instance is not because of COVID-19, rather because there is a cogent link between disturbed behaviour (inability to self-isolate being a product of mental disorder) and a risk to others (mediated by a dangerous virus). Indeed, it is often the case that factors entirely independent of a patient's mental disorder are relevant to a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f decision regarding seclusion. A very large and strong individual is far more likely to require seclusion in order to manage the same degree of behavioural disturbance as someone who lacks that physical presence. Needless to say, having an imposing stature is neither a symptom of mental disorder nor something we aim to 'treat' in psychiatryyet it is relevant to risk of harm to others, and so also to a decision to seclude. Fundamentally, a risk of 'harm to others' necessarily relates to factors extrinsic to the individual's mental disorder.

He usually has a supportive network of friends and carers, he has a voluntary job three days a week, and attends a day centre the other two. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, almost all of his usual support disappeared. He became anxious and started taking a reduced dose of his clozapine. He was detained under s.3 of the MHA 1983 after being found wandering in a state of self -neglect outside his flat. On admission he was found to have a fever, though he appears otherwise physically well. He appears distracted and profoundly thought disordered. He is neither aggressive nor violent. He seems incapable of engaging in a conversation around isolation and repeatedly tries to leave his bedroom. In order to prevent him from doing so, he has been placed by staff on 1:1 observations, and his bedroom door is intermittently being locked.",

He thinks he probably has COVID-19 but says he doesn't care if he gives it to other patients or staff, and says it is his right to use the TV lounge as much as he wants.

He is unlikely to be discharged as he is in the midst of offence-related psychological work, and has not yet had leave granted by the Ministry of Justice, due to a succession of violent incidents on the ward.
