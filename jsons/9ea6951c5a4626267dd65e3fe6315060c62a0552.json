            "text": "Pulmonary surfactant is the evolutionary solution to the problem of surface tension and air breathing. Without surfactant, each breath would require inordinate energy expenditure to expose the huge intrapulmonary surface (approximately the size of a badminton court) to inspired air, and life on land, at least as we know it, would be virtually impossible. One of the fi rst insights into the existence of surface tension forces in the lungs came from the study of von Neergaard in 1929 [1] . Von Neergaard observed that it took nearly twice as much pressure to infl ate excised animal lungs with air as it did with fl uid. He speculated that because infl ating the lungs with an aqueous solution eliminated the air-liquid interface in the alveoli, the additional work required to infl ate the lungs with air must be incurred in overcoming surface tension forces at that interface. Von Neergaard's work was supported several decades later in studies by Gruenwald [2] and Mead et al. [3] , which further documented the importance of surface tension forces in respiration. Moreover, additional studies indicated that surface tension forces were moderated in the normal lungs by the action of surfaceactive agents (i.e., surfactants). Work by Pattle [4] in 1955 suggested that the stability of bubbles in the foam expressed from the lungs was related to surfactants that acted to abolish the tension of the alveolar surface. Clements [5] , Brown [6] , and Pattle [7] subsequently confi rmed the existence of surfactants in the lungs by further surface tension and biochemical studies.",

            "text": "The crucial physiologic importance of lung surfactant in respiration was shown by the early fi nding that a lack of this material in premature infants contributed to the development of hyaline membrane disease (HMD; later called the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or RDS) [7, 8] . This fi nding stimulated the interest of physicians, spurring further research into the function and composition of surfactant. However, clinical interest was signifi cantly interface involves a water-based fl uid layer contacting air, as occurs in the alveoli of mammals. In the absence of lung surfactant, surface tension at the alveolar interface would be quite high-on the order of 50 dynes/cm for tissue fl uid that contains nonspecifi c soluble proteins and other endogenous solutes [12] . The surface tension of aqueous fl uids is high because water is a strongly polar substance with signifi cant intermolecular attractive forces. Liquid (water) molecules at the interface have a strong attraction toward the bulk of the liquid with no equivalent attractive forces above the surface because molecules in the gas (air) are so dilute. These unbalanced forces cause the surface to minimize its area, giving rise to surface tension ( Figure 10 .1). In a construct such as a spherical bubble, surface tension forces necessitate a pressure drop to maintain the interface at equilibrium against collapse. As described by Laplace in the 18th century for a spherical bubble, this pressure drop (\u0394P) is directly proportional to the surface tension (\u03b3) and inversely proportional to the radius of curvature (R), that is, \u0394P = 2\u03b3/R. Surfactants are molecules that have an energetic preference for the interface. Molecules that are surface active at an air-water interface all share the characteristic of being amphipathic, that is, possessing both polar and nonpolar regions in their structure. Pulmonary surfactant is largely composed of phospholipids that are molecules with polar phosphate head groups and nonpolar fatty chains or tails. This structure gives phospholipids an energetic preference for the interface in that they can orient with the polar head group in the aqueous hypophase and the nonpolar hydrocarbon moieties in the air. Lung surfactant also contains proteins that have regions of polar and nonpolar structure, and these proteins interdigitate with phospholipid molecules in the interfacial fi lm and in bilayers/lamellae in the aqueous phase. A surfactant fi lm at an air-water interface acts to lower surface tension because the attractive forces between surfactant molecules and water molecules are less than those of water molecules for each other (if this were not true, and the surfactant molecules had a stronger attraction for water, they would necessarily go into solution rather than being at the interface). The presence of a surfactant fi lm thus reduces the net unbalanced attractive force between interfacial region and bulk liquid molecules, lowering surface tension as a function of surfactant concentration. In the lungs, the surfactant fi lm at the alveolar interface has powerful consequences for pressure-volume (PV) mechanics and respiratory function.",

            "text": "Pulmonary surfactant exists in the alveolar hypophase in a complex microstructure of phospholipid-rich aggregates with incorporated apoproteins. Surfactant molecules in the hypophase adsorb to the air-water interface, which is energetically preferred as described above. The resulting surface fi lm is compressed and expanded during breathing and lowers and varies surface tension in a dynamic fashion. As alveolar size decreases during exhalation, the surfactant fi lm is compressed and surface tension reaches very low values (<1 mN/m compared with 70 mN/m for pure water at 37\u00b0C). As alveolar size increases with inspiration, the surfactant fi lm is expanded, and surface tension proportionately increases. This dynamic variation of surface tension with area allows alveoli of different sizes to coexist stably at fi xed pressure during respiration ( Figure 10 .2). Small alveoli resist collapse at end expiration because their surface tension is low, and alveolar infl ation is better distributed during inhalation because the ratio of surface tension to area is more uniform in different-sized alveoli. Moreover, by reducing surface tension throughout the lungs, surfactant decreases the pressures (work) needed for pulmonary infl ation. There is a direct connection between the surface activity of lung surfactant and pulmonary PV mechanics. The physiologic consequences of surfactant defi ciency or dysfunction are profound, as seen in the diffuse atelectasis, uneven infl ation, and severe ventilation/ Liquid Gas 2 1 FIGURE 10.1. Molecular forces leading to surface tension at a liquid-gas interface. Attractive forces from nearest neighbors are illustrated for an idealized bulk liquid molecule (1) and an interfacial region molecule (2) contacting a gas. Because the gas is much more dilute, gas molecules exert a negligible attraction on interfacial molecules compared with the liquid. This leads to an unbalanced inward attractive force that causes the surface to minimize its area, generating surface tension. (From Notter [12] When alveolar radius is large RESULT: The ratio of surface tension to radius is more uniform in each alveolus and throughout the lung, stabilizing P-V behavior from Laplace's law. to maintain alveoli at equilibrium is proportional to surface tension (\u03b3) and inversely proportional to radius (r), i.e., \u0394P = 2\u03b3/r (Laplace's law for a sphere). By lowering and varying surface tension as a function of alveolar size (radius), lung surfactant acts to stabilize pulmonary P-V mechanics as shown schematically. Surfactant also greatly decreases the overall work of breathing by a generalized lowering of surface tension throughout the alveolar network. See text for discussion.",

Lung surfactant also contains fl uid unsaturated PCs, plus a range of other phospholipid classes with a mix of saturated and unsaturated compounds. Fluid phospholipids increase the respreading of lung surfactant fi lms so that material ejected from the interface during compression reenters the fi lm during expansion and remains available for subsequent respiratory cycles. Neutral lipids in lung surfactant also may help increase fi lm respreading. Surfac-tant proteins have crucial biophysical actions in facilitating the adsorption of phospholipids into the air-water interface, and SP-B and SP-C also act within the surface fi lm itself to refi ne its composition, increase respreading, and optimize surface tension, lowering during dynamic cycling. A summary of the molecular characteristics and activities of the four lung surfactant proteins is given in Table 10 .3. The two small hydrophobic surfactant proteins (SP-B and SP-C) are found in approximately equal amounts in endogenous surfactant (totaling about 1.5% by weight relative to phospholipid) and are vital to surface activity. Surfactant protein B, which is the most active of the two in increasing adsorption and overall dynamic surface activity [12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , is a particularly important component of functional surfactant.

            "text": "Pulmonary surfactant is also important in innate (nonadaptive) pulmonary host defense. The epithelial lining of the lungs is critically positioned to participate in the neutralization and clearance of inhaled microorganisms or other particles. Two of the surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D) are members of a family of proteins called collectins that play a vital role in innate host defense [24] [25] [26] [27] . Other collectins include complement, mannan binding lectin (MBL), and conglutinin. Surfactant proteins A and D are synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II cells and also by nonciliated bronchiolar cells (Clara cells) in the airways [24, 25] . As a class, collectins are large multimeric proteins composed of an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, a collagen-like region, an \u03b1helical coiled neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) [24] [25] [26] . The basic collectin structure is a trimer of the polypeptide chain, but different collectins have different degrees of higher order oligomerization [26] . Surfactant protein A forms octadecamers (6 trimers), whereas SP-D preferentially accumulates as dodecamers (4 trimers). The C-terminal domains of SP-A and SP-D are responsible for their lectin (carbohydrate binding) activity, and trimeric clusters of the peptide chains are required for high-affi nity binding to multivalent ligands. Both proteins bind to the mannose or glucose sugars present in most microbial ligands, although SP-A preferentially binds to the di-mannose repeating unit in Grampositive capsular polysaccharides and SP-D to the glucose-containing core oligosaccharides of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [24] . Both can also interact with lipids, SP-A with phospholipids and the lipid A domain of Gram-negative LPS and SP-D with the lipid and inositol moieties of phosphatidylinositol.",

Although no specifi c diseases associ-ated with defi ciencies of these proteins in humans have been described, murine knockout models have elucidated their role in host defense. Surfactant protein-A-defi cient mice have normal surfactant homeostasis and respiratory function but enhanced susceptibility to a number of different bacteria, viruses, and parasites [24, 28, 29] . The phenotype of SP-D-defi cient mice is somewhat confusing in that these animals develop a lipoproteinosis-like disease that makes effects on innate immunity diffi cult to separate from changes in surfactant function [30] .

As much as 90% of the surfactant cleared from the alveolar space is taken up and recycled by type II pneumocytes, with the highest uptake percentages found in newborn compared with adult or premature animals [12, 33, 53, 54] . Alveolar macrophages are responsible for only about 10%-15% of surfactant clearance, and a smaller percentage (<5%) is cleared via the airways. Studies using labeled surfactant introduced into the airways have demonstrated direct uptake by type II pneumocytes, repackaging in lamellar bodies, and eventual resecretion [55] . The half-life for turnover of human surfactant is variable and has been reported to range from 1 to 24 hr in animals [12, 33, 53] . Surfactant protein A has been shown to enhance the uptake of surfactant phospholipids into type II pneumocytes [56] [57] [58] , and SP-B/C may also infl uence phospholipid uptake in type II cells [59, 60] . The uptake of exogenously administered surfactants as substrate is thought to be an important factor in the indirect (nonsurfaceactive) benefi ts of surfactant therapy, particularly for relatively inactive preparations with a high DPPC content such as Exosurf\u00ae and ALEC\u00ae (pharmaceutical surfactants are described in more detail later).",

Another common feature is infl ammation. The innate pulmonary infl ammatory response is complex, involving the recruitment and activation of circulating leukocytes as well as participation by resident lung cells. A large number of infl ammatory mediators and transduction and regulatory pathways are involved in acute pulmonary infl ammation and injury (for comprehensive reviews on lung injury and infl ammation, see Notter et al.

Although an element of surfactant defi ciency can be present in ALI/ARDS, surfactant dysfunction (inhibition and/or inactivation) as a consequence of infl ammatory injury and edema is generally much more prominent. Extensive basic research over the past two decades has identifi ed many of the mechanisms contributing to surfactant dysfunction in lung injury (detailed reviews of lung surfactant inhibition and mechanisms of dysfunction are available [12, 17, 65] ).

Physicochemical interactions with inhibitory or reactive substances: A prevalent cause of surfactant dysfunction in lung injury is through biophysical or chemical interactions with substances that gain access to the alveolar space following damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane. Albumin, hemoglobin, fi brin, fi brinogen, and other blood or serum proteins have been shown in vitro to diminish the surface tension lowering of lung surfactant by competing with the adsorption of its active components into the airwater interface, thus compromising fi lm formation [66, 67] . Other biophysical inhibitors include cell membrane lipids, lysophospholipids, or fatty acids that mix into the interfacial fi lm itself to impair surface tension lowering during dynamic compression [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Additional biophysical inhibitors are listed in Table 10 .6, which also notes chemically acting inhibitors such as phospholipases or proteases that can degrade essential surfactant lipids or proteins to impair surface activity [71] [72] [73] . Lung surfactant can also be chemically altered by interactions with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [65] . Fortunately, although surfactant can be inhibited by these physicochemical processes, it has been well-documented, at least in vitro, that dysfunction can be overcome by increasing the concentration of active surfactant even if inhibitors are still present [12, 65] .",

The percentage of large aggregates and their content of SP-A and SP-B are reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with ARDS [82] [83] [84] . Surfactant phospholipid composition can also be altered in patients with ALI/ARDS [84, 85] . Animal models of ALI/ARDS show that large surfactant aggregates can be depleted or reduced in activity by interactions with inhibitors or by changes in surfactant metabolism [77, [86] [87] [88] [89] . Although large aggregates can be detrimentally affected in ALI/ARDS, information on total surfactant pools is inconsistent, with both decreased [90] [91] [92] and unchanged [85, 93] amounts reported.",

The contribution of surfactant dysfunction to ALI/ARDS is almost certainly dependent on the stage of disease, which commences with an exudative phase involving alveolar-capillary membrane damage and acute infl ammation but may evolve to fi broproliferation and fi brosis. The superimposition of iatrogenic factors such as ventilator-induced lung injury and hyperoxic injury during intensive care further confounds pathology, as does the multiorgan disease that is frequently present in patients with ALI/ARDS. The multifaceted pathology of lung injury is an important issue when evaluating the potential effi cacy of exogenous surfactant therapy in ALI/ARDS.",

Moreover, to be effective in ALI/ARDS, exogenous surfactant must be delivered and distributed to injured alveoli in the necessary amounts despite the presence of edema and infl ammation. Similar to initial attempts to treat RDS in premature infants, the fi rst large controlled trial of surfactant replacement in ARDS using the aerosolized protein-free synthetic surfactant Exosurf\u00ae was an unequivocal failure [94] . This failure at least partly refl ects similar reasons, that is, the use of a surfactant with inadequate activity and an ineffective delivery method. However, surfactant therapy in ALI/ARDS faces more complex challenges than in the case of neonatal RDS, and this therapy remains investigational particularly for adults, as detailed next. ",

The degree of resemblance of pharmaceutical surfactants to native surfactant is highly variable and has direct consequences for surface and physiologic activity. Pharmaceutical surfactants can be divided into three functionally relevant groups: (1) organic solvent extracts of lavaged lung surfactant from animals, (2) organic solvent extracts of processed animal lung tissue with or without additional synthetic additives, and (3) synthetic preparations not containing surfactant material from animal lungs (Table 10 .7). Organic solvent extracts of lavaged alveolar surfactant (category I) contain all of the hydrophobic lipid and protein components of endogenous surfactant, although specifi c compositional details can vary depending on preparative methodology. Extracts of minced or homogenized lung tissue (category II) necessarily contain some nonsurfactant components and require more extensive processing that can further alter composition compared with native surfactant. The synthetic surfactants in category III that have been most widely studied are Exosurf\u00ae and ALEC\u00ae (artifi cial lung expanding compound). Exosurf is a mixture of DPPC : hexadecanol : tyloxapol (1 : 0.11 : 0.075 by weight), and ALEC is a mixture of 7 : 3 DPPC : egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These two preparations are no longer in active clinical use because they have been shown to have inferior activity compared with animal-derived surfactants [e.g., 12, [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] .

Infasurf\u00ae is a direct chloroform : methanol extract of large aggregate surfactant obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from calf lungs [12, 56, 101] . Survanta\u00ae is made from an extract of minced bovine lung tissue to which DPPC, tripalmitin, and palmitic acid are added [12, 18] . Curosurf\u00ae is prepared from minced porcine lung tissue by a combination of washing, chloroformmethanol extraction, and liquid-gel chromatography [102] . Sur-faxin\u00ae, which is under active consideration for FDA approval, contains a 21 amino acid peptide (KL4) that has repeating units of one leucine (K) and four lysine (L) residues. This peptide is combined at 3% by weight with a 3 : 1 mixture of DPPC and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) plus 15% palmitic acid [12] .

Differences in effi cacy among pharmaceutical surfactants have been demonstrated in comparison trials in premature infants and in retrospective metaanalyses (reviewed by Notter [12] ). These differences in surfactant activity can be directly linked to differences in composition. The fact that natural surfactants from animal lungs (categories I and II, Table 10 .7) have greater effi cacy than the protein-free synthetic surfactants Exosurf\u00ae and ALEC\u00ae refl ects the diffi culty of substituting for the highly active hydrophobic lung surfactant proteins SP-B/C in synthetic surfactants. The surface and physiologic activities of Exosurf\u00ae are signifi cantly increased by the addition of purifi ed bovine SP-B/SP-C, demonstrating that its synthetic components do not adequately replace these active apoproteins [95] . Animalderived clinical surfactants also differ markedly in their surface activity and ability to resist inhibitor-induced dysfunction based on their compositions.",

It has also been shown that differences in apoprotein content can help explain some of these differences in activity [14, 16, 18, 95, 103, 104] . For example, the activity and inhibition resistance of Infasurf\u00ae are substantially greater than those of Survanta\u00ae in basic biophysical and animal research [18, 95, 96, 103] (see Figures  10.5 to 10.7) , and these differences correlate directly with the content of SP-B in the two preparations [18, 103, 105] . Survanta\u00ae contains only 0.044% SP-B by weight relative to phospholipid because of losses during processing of lung tissue [18] . In contrast, Infasurf\u00ae has a specifi c SP-B content of 0.9% by weight (and a total hydrophobic protein content of 1.7% by weight) equivalent to lavaged calf lung surfactant [18] . As described earlier, SP-B is the most active of the hydrophobic surfactant proteins in enhancing the adsorption and overall dynamic surface activities of phospholipids [14] [15] [16] 18, 106, 107] . The addition of SP-B or synthetic SP-B peptides to Survanta\u00ae signifi cantly improves its activity toward that of natural surfactant [18, 103, 104] (e.g., Figure 10 .7), indicating that the lack of SP-B in this exogenous surfactant is functionally important. Even without SP-B, however, Survanta\u00ae still has Note: Infasurf\u00ae (ONY, Inc., and Forest Laboratories), Survanta\u00ae (Abbott/Ross Laboratories), and Curosurf\u00ae (Chesi Farmaceutici and Dey Laboratories) are currently FDA approved in the United States, and Surfaxin\u00ae (KL4) is under clinical evaluation. Exosurf\u00ae (Glaxo-Wellcome) is also FDA approved but is no longer used. Details on the compositions, activities, and efficacies of these exogenous surfactants in neonatal RDS are reviewed by Notter [12] , and their use in ALI/ARDS is discussed in the text.

For example, animal studies indicate that direct airway instillation is more effective than current aerosol techniques in delivering exogenous surfactant to the alveoli and that early therapy is preferable to later therapy in terms of distributing surfactant to injured lungs (reviewed by Notter [12] ). However, despite their utility for assessing the acute effects of exogenous surfactants and comparing preparations and delivery methods, animal models offer limited insight into longer term morbidity or mortality. For this, one must ultimately turn to human studies.",

[149, 150] also reported favorable results using Survanta\u00ae in a controlled trial in term infants referred for ECMO because of severe respiratory failure (meconium aspiration was a prevalent diagnosis in both studies). Twenty-eight infants treated with four doses of Survanta\u00ae (150 mg/kg) had improved pulmonary mechanics, decreased duration of ECMO treatment, and a lower incidence of complications after ECMO than control infants [149] . A subsequent multicenter controlled trial with 328 term infants also reported signifi cant improvements in respiratory status and the need for ECMO following surfactant treatment [150] . Exogenous surfactant is now used in many institutions to treat respiratory failure in term infants with meconium aspiration or pneumonia, although fewer controlled studies are available for the latter condition. Surfactant therapy has also been studied in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but its use remains somewhat controversial in this context [158, 159] .",

The fi rst large prospective, controlled study of surfactant therapy for adults with ARDS was defi nitively negative. Anzueto et al [94] administered nebulized Exosurf\u00ae versus placebo to 725 adults with ARDS secondary to sepsis and found no improvement in any measure of oxygenation and no effect on morbidity or mortality. As described earlier, Exosurf\u00ae is no longer used clinically in the United States because of its lower activity compared with animal-derived surfactants, and aerosolization is currently not as effective as airway instillation in delivering surfactant. Gregory et al. [155] reported small benefi ts in oxygenation in a controlled trial in adults with ARDS who received four 100 mg/kg doses of Sur-vanta\u00ae but with no overall advantage in survival in the 43 surfactant-treated patients studied. A recent study by Spragg et al. [160] using recombinant SP-C surfactant (Venticute\u00ae) in adults with ARDS showed immediate improvements in oxygenation but no longer term improvement in duration of mechanical ventilation, lengths of stay, or mortality. Post hoc analysis did suggest, however, that the response in the subgroup of patients with ARDS caused by direct lung injury was quite positive, and a follow-up prospective study with this group of patients is currently underway.",

            "text": "As described in preceding sections, surfactant replacement therapy is standard in the prevention and treatment of RDS in premature infants, and there is basic science and clinical evidence supporting its use in some forms of lung injury-associated respiratory failure. Clinical evidence of the effi cacy of surfactant therapy for term infants with meconium aspiration is suffi ciently strong that this approach is now frequently used in neonatal intensive care units (and is also being applied to other forms of neonatal respiratory failure, such as pneumonia). Controlled trials of surfactant therapy for children with ALI/ARDS also suggest signifi cant benefi ts, with survival advantages shown in a recent trial [144] . It can be argued that evidence of surfactant dysfunction in ALI/ARDS, along with favorable results for surfactant treatment in animal models and evidence for effi cacy in humans without signifi cant adverse effects, makes a strong rationale for considering surfactant therapy for any pediatric patient with pulmonary injury and ALI/ARDS. From this perspective, the major downside of the therapy is its considerable expense. However, it would be ideal if additional questions about the therapy were addressed in research before its indiscriminate adoption.",

            "text": "As emphasized in this chapter, some exogenous surfactants are more active and have better inhibition resistance than others, and this, along with effective delivery, will impact the success of surfactant therapy for ALI/ARDS. It is also likely that surfactant therapy is more applicable for some types of pulmonary injury than others. It is important to note that post hoc analyses in the studies of both Spragg et al. [160] and Willson et al. [144] suggested greater effi cacy in direct lung injury (e.g., pneumonia, aspiration) as opposed to indirect lung injury (e.g., sepsis, systemic infl ammatory response syndrome). It would obviously be helpful to focus surfactant therapy on the types of lung injury where it has maximal benefi t. Also, neonatal data suggest that early surfactant administration generates improved responses compared with delayed administration [e.g., 162], possibly as a result of better intrapulmonary drug distribution coupled with minimized ventilator-induced lung injury. Intuitively, similar advantages might accompany early surfactant administration in patients with ALI/ARDS.",

            "text": "Finally, a major issue with regard to surfactant therapy in ALI/ ARDS involves its potential use in combination with agents or interventions that target additional aspects of the complex pathophysiology of acute pulmonary injury. This kind of combination therapy approach may be particularly important for adults with ALI/ARDS, whose responses to exogenous surfactant have so far been disappointing. The use of multiple therapeutic agents or interventions based on specifi c rationales for potential synergy has the potential to signifi cantly enhance patient outcomes in complex disease processes such as those involving infl ammatory lung injury. The potential use of exogenous surfactant therapy in the context of specifi c combined-modality interventions is described in detail elsewhere [163, 164] . Examples of agents that might be synergistic with exogenous surfactant in ALI/ARDS include antiinfl ammatory antibodies or receptor antagonists, antioxidants, and vasoactive drugs such as inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). In addition, specifi c ventilator modalities or ventilation strategies that reduce iatrogenic lung injury may be equally important to consider in conjunction with surfactant therapy. Given the known importance of surfactant dysfunction in infl ammatory lung injury, it is likely that ongoing research will continue to identify specifi c populations of patients with ALI/ARDS or related acute respiratory failure who can benefi t from exogenous surfactant therapy, with or without complementary agents or interventions.

Minimum surface tension after 5 min of pulsation in a bubble surfactometer (37\u00b0C, 20 cycles/min, 50% area compression) is plotted as a function of surfactant phospholipid concentration for several clinical surfactants. These surfactants vary widely in overall surface tension lowering ability, with the most active being CLSE (Infasurf\u00ae, category I,Table 10.7). (Redrawn from Seeger et al. [96]Resistances of clinical surfactants to inhibition by blood proteins. Minimum surface tension after 5 min of pulsation in a bubble surfactometer (37\u00b0C, 20 cycles/min, and 50% area compression) is plotted against the concentration of inhibitory blood proteins (fibrinogen [A] and hemoglobin [B]). Exogenous surfactants that most closely mimic natural surfactant (category I drugs from Table 10.7) are best able to resist inhibition and reach low surface tension despite high levels of inhibitory proteins. Surfactant phospholipid concentration was 2 mg/mL.

(B) Premature rabbit fetuses treated with Survanta\u00ae, Survanta\u00ae + SP-B (2% by weight by ELISA), natural surfactant from adult sheep (Sheep S), or untreated controls. Infasurf\u00ae improved lung mechanics more than Survanta\u00ae (A), and the importance of SP-B in this behavior is shown by the increased activity of Survanta\u00ae + SP-B compared to Survanta\u00ae alone (B). Surfactants were instilled intratracheally at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, and quasistatic pressure-volume curves were measured following 15 min of mechanical ventilation.

Copyright 2001 the Channal Reviews.FIGURE 10.3.Schematic overview of the pulmonary surfactant system. The specific lipids and proteins that make up lung surfactant are synthesized, processed, packaged, stored, secreted, and recycled by alveolar type II cells. Surfactant is secreted from lamellar body organelles into the alveolar hypophase, where it forms heterogeneous aggregates (phospholipids plus incorporated apoproteins) that include tubular myelin plus other lamellar/ vesicular structures. Surfactant absorbs from these aggregates to form a film at the airhypophase interface, which acts to lower and vary surface tension during breathing. Over time, \"spent\" surface-active material in the hypophase is eventually taken up back into the type II pneumocyte for recycling. (From Notter[12], with permission from Taylor & Francis Group.)",
