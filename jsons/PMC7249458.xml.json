As per the World Health Organization (WHO) on April 9, more than 1,500,000 patients worldwide have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) caused by a laboratory-confirmed infection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with more than 84,000 global deaths at this time.1 Our hospital systems are rapidly filling with patients suffering from viral illness, and the capacity of resources such as emergency departments, inpatient wards, and intensive care units (ICUs) has become overwhelmed in some regions. There is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Early diagnosis is critical in establishing quarantine and limiting the spread of outbreaks; diagnostics later in the course of an epidemic remain important, particularly in determining established immunity. For those infected, there is a current paucity in validated antiviral therapies, and there is no vaccine at this time, although multiple efforts are under way. Even after the predicted resolution of COVID-19, the increasing frequency of viral outbreaks (including the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2 2014 Ebola virus,3 2015 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,4 and 2015 Zika virus outbreaks5) suggests that new mechanisms to combat viral infections are a high priority.",

Relevant background information regarding SARS-CoV-2 is briefly reviewed, and pertinent tissue engineering work is highlighted, including development of viral in vitro models, drug delivery systems, and vaccine platforms. Given the current state of the pandemic, it may be challenging to mobilize new efforts within the tissue engineering community in time to change practice in health care. New in vitro models, diagnostics, and therapeutics will need to be validated prior to safe implementation at the clinical level. In addition, many major academic centers are currently at limited capacity due to precautions to limit the spread of the pandemic. However, COVID-19 can act as a representative outbreak for which tissue engineers can learn from and begin preparations to lead the way to prevent and treat the next viral epidemic better.",

The virus gets its name from the projections, or \u201cspikes,\u201d emerging from its envelope that appear crown-like on electron micrography. The major components of SARS-CoV-2 are the envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), and its relatively large RNA genome of \u223c30 kb.13,14 Enveloped viruses have a protective lipid bilayer with surface proteins and are generally more vulnerable to harsh environments than non-enveloped viruses. The spike protein is supposed to interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein to induce fusion, endocytosis, and subsequent invasion into the host cell.15 Coronaviruses escape endosomes to the cytoplasm via acid-dependent cleavage of the S protein.14 RNA viruses, with few exceptions, replicate in the cytoplasm. The virus takes advantage of host ribosomes to replicate by translation and then assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum directed by M and E protein interactions. Viruses are then released by exocytosis to repeat the cycle of infection. Given this pathophysiology, potential targets being explored as therapeutics agents include blocking ACE2 interactions, altering endosome pH to prevent escape, inhibiting viral and/or host enzymes critical to replication, and downregulating host inflammation, given that an overexuberant response may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).16",

However, interferon itself is an important regulator of host binding proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2.28 In general, the relevance of a drug's ability to inhibit viral infection of a malignant nonhuman primate (NHP) kidney cell lacking interferon production is uncertain. For example, while the antidepressant sertraline was found to have potent in vitro activity against Ebola in the Vero cell model,26 later testing in an in vivo NHP model failed to show protection against Ebola.29 Static cultures of xenograft monolayers fail to replicate many of the conditions facing viruses in vivo, including realistic extracellular matrix (ECM), three-dimensional cell\u2013cell interfaces, and shear forces.

Developments of induced pluripotent stem cells, CRISPR-Cas, microfluidics, 3D printing, and biomaterials have led to technologies such as tissue-on-a-chip and advanced bioreactor models containing co-cultures of cells from ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal lineages. These models, utilizing human cells, have been able to mimic complex pathophysiology such as generation of pulmonary edema upon exposure to inflammatory signals such as interleukin-2.31 For example, in a model to study influenza A virus, 3D tissue-engineered constructs more accurately recapitulated the host morphology of cultured human epithelial airway cells compared to 2D culture, and infection with major influenza strains resulted in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.32 One coronavirus-specific example of a tissue-engineered platform in which respiratory viruses have been studied is the rotation wall vessel bioreactor. These models simulate low physiologic shear stresses and frequently incorporate multiple pulmonary cell types, including co-culture of human mesenchymal bronchial tracheal cells and human bronchial epithelial cells, challenging them against respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-1.33 Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-1 did not replicate in this study.34 In another model, human pulmonary epithelial progenitor cells were grown on a collagen matrix in a serum-free media with a mesenchymal stroma and exposed to virus. It was demonstrated that stem cells were targeted by SARS-CoV-1, which may suggest why normal lung regeneration following viral infection is challenging.35",

These therapies generally need to be delivered intravenously to be successful. In the Ebola virus studies, for example, patients required one to three infusion sessions, depending on the antibody. A human monoclonal antibody was developed against SARS-CoV-1 and was demonstrated to be effective in a ferret model.38 Researchers have screened monoclonal antibodies designed against SARS-CoV-1 and have discovered cross-reactivity of at least one of the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.50 Systems designs for the controlled extended release of antibodies may be advantageous over multiple infusion sessions for clinical practice. Nanoporous scaffolds coated with allylamine-based polymer were capable of releasing rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against B cells, for up to 30 days.51 Similarly, an alginate-based drug delivery system was able to deliver a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody in a rat model for at least 28 days with a single dose of the system.52 In addition to the possibility of reducing administration to single dosing by extended release, there has also been development of ingestible injection systems to deliver biomacromolecules through autoinjection during gastric transit. These allowed for insulin delivery in a porcine model and may facilitate oral delivery of medications previously only efficacious in intravenous form.53",

Furthermore, the field is characterizing how the size, shape, and other physicochemical properties of biomaterials affect the behavior of immune cells.62\u201364 The goals of many of these systems are to target antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells and to drive specific responses such as Th1 or Th2 (different helper T classes). For example, conjugation of different receptors to protein-based particles can individually tune Th1 or Th2 response in a murine model.65 Biodegradable polymers, one of the primary workhorses as scaffold material in tissue engineering, have also been explored. PLGA nanoparticles drive Th1 immune response compared to no carriers and other biomaterials in a vaccine against Chagas disease in a murine model66 and have also been explored for targeted delivery to specific immune populations.67 PLGA microparticles in combination with a chitosan/peptide conjugate coating have also been used as a delivery system to target specific mucosal cells and to deliver a swine dysentery vaccine with elevated IgA and IgG production in mice.68 In another murine model, chitosan nanoparticles enhanced T-cell response for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA vaccine.69 When chitosan was mannosylated to promote endocytosis, an intranasal vaccine increased IgG levels in a murine model.70 For influenza, chitosan has also been modified to create a thermoresponsive intranasal murine vaccine against H5N1l.71 Silver nanoparticles have also been used to deliver inactivated influenza vaccine locally with some specificity to lung immune cells, resulting in greater IgG titers and reduced mortality in a murine model.40 While there are currently fewer studies regarding coronavirus vaccines, there has been some success in mice in which nanoparticles were prepared from a SARS-CoV-1 peptide sequence, and subsequent sera was successful in preventing infection of Vero cells.72",

With specific physicochemical properties, such as pore size, and profile of released recruitment signals such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, scaffolds of PLGA73,74 and mesoporous silica rods64,75 have been used to recruit and concentrate antigen-presenting cells to vaccine components. This strategy has primarily been applied to tumor vaccines and has demonstrated efficacy in animal models against melanoma and intracranial gliomas.73,76 It is currently undergoing a Phase I clinical trial of 23 patients with melanoma, which is estimated to complete in June 2020 (NCT01753089; ClinicalTrials.gov). This platform of scaffold-based vaccination has also shown efficacy against bacterial pathogens in porcine and murine models.77 Other examples of scaffold-based vaccine systems include those generated from respiratory syncytial virus that were effective in mice as well NHPs.78,79 These particle-based and scaffold-based vaccine systems may be promising in translation against SARS-CoV-2. However, the majority have only been studied in mouse models at this point in time, and significant translational efforts will need to be undertaken for clinical trials. Modular platforms in which different antigens can be plugged in77 may be very useful for rapid vaccine development in future pandemics.",
