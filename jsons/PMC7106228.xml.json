            "text": "An 18-month-old, castrated male, domestic pet ferret was evaluated for severe lethargy that rapidly progressed to acute collapse. The ferret was fed commercially available pellets (Supreme Science Selective Ferret, Supreme Petfood Limited, Suffolk, UK) offered ad libitum and occasionally supplemented with raw eggs and meat. The animal was kept in an outdoor wire enclosure with 7 other ferrets but frequently brought indoors. The ferret had free access to water and there was no history of trauma, toxin exposure, or any other previous health problems. All the other household members (i.e., animals and humans) had no overt clinical disease and remained healthy during and after their cagemate disease and death. The ferret patient was up to date on its vaccination status for canine distemper virus (CDV). The morning the ferret was presented to the veterinary hospital, it had not emerged to feed and was very lethargic. On presentation at the clinic, the patient was laterally recumbent, poorly responsive, and appeared in moderate body condition (body weight 1.2 kg; body condition score 2.5/5). Physical examination revealed pale mucous membranes, a capillary refill time >2 seconds, a body temperature of 36.4\u00b0C (97.5\u00b0F) and mild dehydration. Other physical examination findings were unremarkable. Immediate emergency treatment was instituted. A 26 g intravenous catheter was placed into the right cephalic vein. Warmed lactated Ringer solution was administered at 10 mL/kg/h via a syringe pump (Graseby MS16A, Smiths Medical MD, Inc, St. Paul, MN USA). The ferret was placed on a water recirculating heat pad (TPump professional, Gaymar, Orchard Park, NY USA) to gradually increase his body temperature. A Doppler probe (Ultratec PD1v, Thames Medical, West Sussex, UK) was applied to the left carpus and held in place by adhesive tape. Indirect blood pressure measurement was taken and was found to be constantly less than 40 mm Hg. A slow bolus of 5 mL/kg intravenous hetastarch (Voluven 6%; Fresenius Kabi Ltd, Cheshire, UK) was provided. Despite the emergency treatment, the ferret\u2019s clinical condition deteriorated rapidly over a 15-minute period until he was completely unresponsive. Respiratory and cardiac arrest occurred and cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation were performed. The ferret was intubated with a 2-mm uncuffed endotracheal tube that was connected to an Ayre T piece and he was manually ventilated. Cardiac compressions were immediately started through the chest wall. Doxapram (Dopram-V injection, 20 mg/mL, Fort Dodge Animal Health Ltd, Hampshire, UK) and adrenaline (Epinephrine injection 1:1000, Martindale Pharmaceuticals, Essex, UK) were administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Fluid therapy was continued and 2 intravenous boluses of 3 mL/kg of hetastarch were repeated 10 minutes apart. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and the ferret died. No antemortem diagnostic testing was performed on the ferret.",

It was then packaged in accordance with current legislation and sent by next day delivery to the pathology laboratory (IZVG Pathology, Yeadon, Leeds, UK). The postmortem examination was performed on the day following the ferret\u2019s death by a qualified anatomical pathologist. On external assessment, the nares were ulcerated and hyperemic (\nFig. 1). Other mucous membranes (e.g., conjunctiva, anus, and oral cavity) were pale pink but smooth and intact. Full-thickness epidermal necrosis and ulceration affected the footpads of all 4 feet (\nFig. 2). The bronchial lymph node at the bifurcation appeared moderately enlarged and a further 25-mm-diameter ovoid, multinodular mass was present on the right side of the mediastinum, distinct and immediately cranial to the cranial lung lobe. The outer surfaces of the multilobular mass were irregular with cream, raised foci and a translucent gray capsule. Cut surfaces were firm, smooth, and oozing a red-gray mucopurulent material. The external surface of the brain was unremarkable, but after fixation, slicing revealed cavitating foci of malacia and hemorrhage involving the inner cerebral cortex and thalamic nuclei (\nFig. 3). No additional macroscopic abnormalities were recognized in the remainder of the carcass. A range of tissue samples were collected from the body and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for routine histological examination. A sample of the mediastinal mass was also submitted for bacterial and fungal culture studies.",

Fungal invasion and granulomatous vasculitis were present in large arteries. Extensive invasion by similar fungi was present within the bronchial lymph node. Much of the forebrain, including the thalamus and cerebral cortex, was disrupted by multifocal liquefactive necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation, again with abundant invading fungal pseudohyphae lacking obvious septation (\nFig. 5). Bacterial cultures yielded no aerobic or anaerobic growth, but selective fungal cultures produced a heavy growth of a Candida-like organism. This was subsequently identified by the Leeds Regional Mycology Reference Laboratory, based on morphological and cultural characteristics, as C. parapsilosis. Histological examination of a full range of organs identified mild centrilobular vacuolar change in the liver that may have been consistent with hypoxia or anemia but could also have been a terminal change. Extramedullary hematopoietic tissue was abundant in the spleen, but this is a common idiopathic finding in adult ferrets. There was no evidence of dysplasia or neoplasia in hematopoietic populations or of disseminated leukemic infiltrates in any organ examined.",

Possible etiologic explanations for the ulcerative dermatitis include vasculitis, thromboembolism, or ischemia of the extremities caused by angioinvasion by the fungus, leading to secondary colonization by mixed populations of bacteria and Malassezia sp. Evidence for these possible etiologic causes of the ulcerative dermatitis was not recognized in the peripheral blood vessels in the affected skin. It is also possible, although considered unlikely, that the ulcerative pododermatitis could have been a cause for the systemic candidiasis rather than a concurrent pathologic response. However, it was not possible to confirm either of these hypotheses. Paraneoplastic immune-mediated dermatoses associated with a number of tumors have been described in human and veterinary medicine.20, 21 Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is sometimes seen with glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumors in dogs and humans.22, 23 No evidence of neoplasia was identified by comprehensive postmortem examination in this case.",

The same report mentioned that several cases of skin disease were associated with ADV in ferrets, suggesting that an impaired immune response may predispose these animals to nonspecific skin infections.43 Immunodeficiency was also thought to be an influencing factor for the development of systemic candidiasis in a 4-month-old ferret from which C. tropicalis was isolated.2 Most systemic mycotic infections in animals and humans are opportunistic and derived from the environment. Direct transmission of Candida spp. between animals and humans is rare, especially in immunocompetent individuals. Neither the origin of the infection nor any evidence of underlying immunosuppressive disease was identified in the ferret described in this report.",
