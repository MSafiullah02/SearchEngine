            "text": "Coronaviruses infect a wide range of mammals and birds, exhibit a marked tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory and enteric tracts and cause a remarkably diverse spectrum of diseases in humans and livestock. They typically have a restricted host range, infecting only their natural host and closely related animal species but do have the capacity to cross the species barrier to infect new hosts. Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is the only coronavirus known to infect or cause disease in horses (Balasuriya, 2013). It belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus lineage A, as does human coronavirus OC43, bovine coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Equine coronavirus was first isolated from faeces of a diarrhoeic foal in 1999 (ECoV\u2010NC99) in North Carolina, USA (Guy, Breslin, Breuhaus, Vivrette, & Smith, 2000), and was initially believed to only affect foals. Since 2010, there have been several reports of ECoV\u2010associated respiratory and enteric infections in adult horses in Japan, Europe and the United States, but its global distribution is still poorly defined (Kooijman, Mapes, & Pusterla, 2016; Miszczak et al., 2014; Oue, Morita, Kondo, & Nemoto, 2013; Pusterla, Holzenkaempfer, Mapes, & Kass, 2015).",

The evidence points to dromedary camels as a natural host and a major source for human MERS\u2010CoV infections (Alexandersen, Kobinger, Soule, & Wernery, 2014; Chu et al., 2015; Gutierrez, Tejedor\u2010Junco, Gonzalez, Lattwein, & Renneker, 2015; Memish et al., 2014; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2014). There is no convincing evidence of MERS\u2010CoV infections in other domestic livestock species so far (Adney et al., 2016; Alexandersen et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2015; Perera et al., 2013). Sequence similarity comparisons of dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4 [CD26]), the functional receptor for MERS\u2010CoV, have revealed that equine DPP4 is phylogentically closely related to human DPP4 and the binding affinity of MERS\u2010CoV spike S1 domain for equine DPP4 is similar to that of human and camel DPP4, raising the possibility that MERS\u2010CoV infections may occur among horses (Barlan et al., 2014). Serological studies of horses originating from Spain and the United Arab Emirates gave negative results for MERS\u2010CoV (Alexandersen et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015), but it is still relevant to investigate for evidence of MERS\u2010CoV in horses in areas endemic for MERS\u2010CoV.",

The homologous antibody titres to the immunized virus were also obtained, where available, from the providers of these respective antisera. The serum panel for alpha coronavirus included sera generated against porcine respiratory coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, canine enteric coronavirus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Sera produced against mouse hepatitis virus strains JHM and A59, SARS coronavirus, BCoV, ECoV represented the betacoronavirus group. Furthermore, an immune serum for infectious bronchitis virus was used as representative for the gammacoronavirus group. All these reference sera, as well as additional ECoV immune sera and MERS\u2010CoV\u2010negative camel sera, were tested in ppNT or MN assays in parallel against MERS\u2010CoV, BCoV, as well as ECoV, to assess possible cross\u2010reactive antibody responses among these three coronaviruses. Some of these reference sera, with the exception of horse and camel sera, had been previously tested against MERS\u2010CoV and BCoV, and the results were reported by us (Hemida et al., 2014).",

All swabs were negative in the MERS\u2010CoV RTqPCR assay. Five rectal swabs (5/315) were positive for coronavirus RNA by the pan\u2010coronavirus assay (Tables 1 and 2). Sequencing of the 440 base pair nucleotide fragment from the RdRp gene confirmed four of these to be ECoV and the other to be dromedary camel HKU23\u2010like virus designated as equine HKU23 CoV SA1354. Additional sequence was obtained from these specimens to generate a nucleotide sequence of 933 nucleotides (position 14,780 to 15,712 of ECoV strain NC99) which was used for analysis of nucleotide differences in comparison with other coronaviruses (GenBank accession numbers KY458228\u2010KY458232) (Table 3) and phylogenetic analysis which confirmed the identification of the coronaviruses to be ECoV and HKU23, respectively (Figure 1). This result led to the testing of 306 nasal and 315 rectal swab specimens by specific RTqPCR assays for ECoV and RTqPCR assay for HKU23. Testing by the ECoV specific RTqPCR led to the detection of five rectal swabs specimens, four of which had been detected by the pan\u2010coronavirus RT\u2010PCR assay as well as an additional positive rectal swab (Ct value 36.3) from a horse in the Riyadh area (Table 2). Using the HKU23\u2010specific RTqPCR, two positives were detected including SA1354 identified as HKU23 by sequencing the pan\u2010coronavirus RT\u2010PCR assay amplicon and an additional positive result with a high Ct value of 37.6 from a nasal swab sample. None of the other nasal swabs had evidence of coronavirus RNA. Compared to the pan\u2010coronavirus assay, the specific ECoV\u2010 and HKU23\u2010specific assays detected one additional specimen that was weakly positive for each of these viruses (Table 2).",

Possible serologic cross\u2010reactions with ECoV and BCoV were evaluated in MN assays which are the most specific serological assays available. Of the 243 sera tested, only five (2%) had detectable MERS\u2010CoV antibody in the MERS\u2010ppNT assay at a screening titre of 20; four of these were from Saudi Arabia, and one was from Oman.

This horse was not known to frequently come into contact with camels. Three of the other sera (serum ID nos 5.35; 5.41; 2.12) positive in the MERS\u2010CoV ppNT assay had detectable ECoV MN antibody and one of these also had detectable BCoV MN antibody (Table 4).

We did not have an isolate of HKU23 virus available for serological testing and BCoV was used as a virus that is genetically closely related to HKU23 with pairwise amino acid similarity of 94.1% in the spike protein gene, the determinant of antigenic cross\u2010reaction in neutralization tests (Woo et al., 2014). Horse sera obtained from the USA reported to be strongly reactive by ELISA (optical density ranging from 1.458 to 1.939) for ECoV showed high titre (>1,280) for ECoV in MN assay as expected, but also had high antibody titres (ranging from 160 to 1,280) in BCoV MN tests (Table 5). As these horse sera were from horses in the \u201cfield,\u201d they may well have been exposed to multiple coronaviruses. Thus, these results may reflect cross\u2010reactivity or co\u2010infection of US horses with ECoV\u2010 and BCoV\u2010like viruses. Two of these sera showed low titres (20) in the MERS\u2010CoV ppNT assay but were negative in the more stringent MERS\u2010CoV MN assay. As MERS\u2010CoV is not circulating in the USA, these results suggest cross\u2010reactivity between MERS\u2010CoV and ECoV or related CoVs may occur, albeit at low titre. Similarly, a BCoV immune serum from an experimentally infected gnotobiotic calf showed detectable, but 16\u2010fold reduced antibody titre with ECoV but no cross\u2010reaction with MERS\u2010CoV. Spike proteins of equine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus have an overall amino acid similarity of 80.8% and 73.1% similarity of the S1 region which contains the receptor\u2010binding domain and neutralization epitopes. This probably explains the large difference in neutralization titres observed in Table 5. A dromedary serum from Kazakhstan, a region known to be free of MERS\u2010CoV activity (Miguel et al., 2016), had detectable antibody to BCoV (probably reflecting HKU23 or BCoV infection) and also to ECoV. We cannot conclude whether this reflects cross\u2010reactivity or infection with BCoV, HKU23 and/or ECoV. None of the beta coronavirus immune sera to SARS\u2010CoV or mouse hepatitis virus, nor immune sera to alpha or gamma coronaviruses gave cross\u2010reactions in BCoV or ECoV MN assays (Table 5). As had been previously reported, none of these dromedary sera cross\u2010reacted with MERS\u2010CoV (Hemida et al., 2014).",

There were twenty\u2010four sera with undetectable antibody to BCoV with detectable ECoV antibody titres ranging from 20 to 640. The titres to ECoV were higher than or equal to titres to BCoV, with two exceptions where the titre to BCoV (20) was marginally higher than that with ECoV (Table 6). These results are compatible with the RT\u2010PCR detection of ECoV in rectal swabs in horses and probably suggest that ECoV or a closely related virus is commonly infecting horses in many regions of the Arabian Peninsula. Two of the five horses in whom ECoV RNA was detected by RTqPCR had low ECoV MN antibody titres (20) while the other three had titres ranging from 160 to 640 (Table 6).
