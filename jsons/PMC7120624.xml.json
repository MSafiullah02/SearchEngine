Fifty children between the ages of 1 and 16 years who were suspected of having sinusitis were evaluated. Children were entered into the study based on clinical symptoms and abnormal plain radiographs of the maxillary sinuses. Sinus puncture was performed and aspirates were cultured aerobically and anaerobically and a Gram stain prepared. A total of 79 sinus aspirates were performed. At least one sinus had significant growth in 51 of 79 (65 %) aspirates. The predominant organisms isolated from the maxillary sinuses by puncture, in order of frequency, were Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. As in studies of otitis media in this era, S. pneumoniae was isolated at about 1.5\u20132 times the rate of isolation of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. It is notable that 13 % of sinus aspirates grew more than one species of bacteria. Six of the 50 subjects had isolates of bacteria that were beta-lactamase producing. This study was also remarkable in that anaerobic bacteria were only present in one aspirate and there were no isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.\n",

            "text": "Because sinus aspiration is not a routine procedure, may be uncomfortable, may rarely be associated with complications, and should only be performed by a pediatric otolaryngologist, there has been a search for a surface culture of the respiratory mucosa, obtained by less invasive methods, which might correlate with the results of the sinus aspirate. The challenge in any less invasive method is that the nasal mucosa is heavily colonized with normal bacterial flora. Cultures of the middle meatus obtained by the use of an endoscope have been used as a surrogate for sinus aspiration. The maxillary, frontal, and anterior air cells of the ethmoid sinuses drain into the middle meatus via the osteomeatal complex. The endoscope is inserted into the nose, and a sample is obtained from material in the middle meatus via a swab or aspiration. The mucosa of the anterior nares must be disinfected, and meticulous care must be taken to be sure the endoscope does not touch the nasal vestibule and become contaminated. Benninger et al. performed a meta-analysis of studies in a mainly adult population comparing endoscopically obtained cultures of the middle meatus to maxillary sinus puncture [5]. When all bacterial isolates are considered, endoscopically obtained cultures show a sensitivity of 80 %, specificity of 70 %, positive predictive value of 78 %, negative predictive value of 75 %, and an overall accuracy of 76 % when compared with maxillary sinus aspiration. If only the sinus pathogens S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis are taken into account, the test performs somewhat better with a sensitivity and specificity of 81 and 83 %, positive and negative predictive value of 91 and 89 %, and overall accuracy of 87 %. Given that the caliber of the nasal passage in children is significantly smaller than adults, one might expect a greater rate of contamination of endoscopically obtained cultures when this procedure is performed in children. Hsin et al. compared endoscopic middle meatal cultures to maxillary sinus puncture in children 2\u201312 years with subacute and chronic sinusitis [6]. This population of children had failed 30 days or more of antimicrobial therapy. Endoscopic culture performed less well in children than adults with a sensitivity of 75 %, a specificity of 99.9 %, a positive predictive value of 96 %, negative predictive value of 50 %, and an accuracy of 78 %. Overall endoscopic cultures may provide useful information for the treatment of individual adults when interpretation is confined to the three sinus pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. However, in epidemiological studies of the etiology of sinusitis, endoscopic cultures are likely to be confounded by normal nasal flora such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium, and Staphylococcus species and, therefore, are of limited usefulness in children.",

If this were the case, it would have important implications for empiric antibiotic selection as current guidelines do not include recommendations for the use of agents that are directed at this pathogen [10, 11]. When examined carefully, however, the role of S. aureus as an etiological agent of acute bacterial sinusitis is doubtful [12]. In adults, during a period of 15 years of performing sinus aspirates, S. aureus was present in only 7 of 226 (3 %) positive specimens obtained from 339 patients [13]. No isolates of staphylococci were detected in significant quantity in the two studies in which maxillary aspirates were performed in 50 children with acute bacterial sinusitis [3, 4].",

In one study of healthy children in a community setting, over 65 % of children harbored S. aureus in the anterior nares [14].

The authors state that S. aureus was found in culture from various sinus and nasal sources 10 % of the time overall. There are significant problems with this analysis, however. First, it is notable that this rate of culture positivity is in the range of results seen in cultures of the middle meatus in healthy adults suggesting that cultures may have been contaminated [17]. Also, in middle meatal cultures, S. aureus was isolated at nearly twice the rate as cultures of sinus aspirates (14 % vs 7.8 %). One would expect that these two rates would be similar unless the middle meatal cultures were contaminated with normal flora. In addition, studies included in this meta-analysis had serious methodological problems. For example, in one of the studies with the highest (20 %) rate of isolation of S. aureus from sinus aspirates, no methods are given for performing the sinus aspirate [18].

Knowledge of changes in the microbiology of acute bacterial sinusitis is important in making decisions about antibiotic selection. In the absence of high-quality data from sinus aspirates, important information may be learned from cultures of middle ear aspirates in children with acute otitis media (AOM). AOM may be used as a surrogate for sinusitis as the middle ear is, in fact, a paranasal sinus [19]. The anatomy and physiology of the middle ear are very similar to that of the sinuses. The middle ear drains via the Eustachian tube into the nasopharynx, analogous to sinus drainage via the osteomeatal complex into the nose. A viral upper respiratory infection is often the predisposing factor for both of these infections causing impairment of drainage with subsequent bacterial growth and inflammation. Like sinusitis, the major pathogens of AOM are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. Examining the changes of the epidemiology of these pathogens in the context of AOM should reflect similar changes that have occurred in acute bacterial sinusitis.",

Two studies have compared the relative rates of isolation of otitis pathogens before and after the introduction of PCV-7 in 2000 for universal immunization in the United States. Block et al. performed tympanocentesis on 381 children aged 7\u201324 months with otitis media in a practice setting in rural Kentucky [20]. After the introduction of PCV-7, the rate of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased significantly from 48 to 21 % of all isolates. Meanwhile, H. influenzae was isolated more frequently during this time period, shifting from 41 to 56 % of isolates. The rate of isolation of Moraxella was not changed in this study. In the second study, covering the period from 1995 to 2003, Casey et al. cultured middle ear fluid obtained from children who had failed treatment for AOM or had persistent AOM [21]. During this time period, the rate of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased from 48 to 31 %, H. influenzae increased from 38 to 57 %, and Moraxella did not change. This same group, however, found a near reversal of this trend between 2007 and 2009 (before the introduction of the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in 2010). During this time frame, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were isolated 44 and 41 % of the time from middle ear fluid [22]. This change was primarily due to the emergence of penicillin-resistant serotype 19 of S. pneumoniae. Subsequent data, accumulated by Pichichero et al., suggest that increasing use of PCV-13 has truncated this issue, with a dramatic diminution of cases caused by S. pneumoniae [23]. Further assessment of this microbiological shift will be important as the use of PCV-13 becomes more widespread. Overall, we can anticipate that the prevalence of S. pneumoniae will continue to decrease and H. influenzae increase as the causative organism in children with AOM in the United States. It is likely the same phenomenon is occurring with acute bacterial sinusitis, since the source of the pathogens in both diseases is ultimately the nasopharynx. The proportion of cases of sinusitis caused by H. influenzae will drive the selection of an appropriate antibiotic that is beta-lactamase stable.\n",

In the original sinus aspiration studies in children in the 1980s, traditional viral cell culture methods were used to identify viruses in sinus samples as well as in throat swabs taken from children with sinusitis [4]. Of 45 children tested, only three had viruses identified on culture. Sinus aspirates grew a parainfluenza virus and an adenovirus, and one throat culture grew a coxsackie B virus. Studies in adults have also isolated rhinovirus in viral culture [13]. No studies of the viruses associated with childhood sinusitis have been reported using molecular techniques nor have any tested for recently recognized respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus or bocavirus. It is widely believed that a viral URI is often the prescient event that results in the complication of acute bacterial sinusitis. Thus, an understanding of the viral epidemiology of sinusitis may lead to methods to prevent this infection. Once again using the analogy of AOM is useful in understanding what is occurring during episodes of sinusitis. Studies surveying the viruses associated with AOM using PCR techniques have demonstrated the presence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human bocavirus, enteroviruses, and coronavirus [35, 36]. It is likely that these same viruses also play a role in the development of acute bacterial sinusitis.",

In children with chronic sinusitis, multiple species of bacteria have been isolated from sinus aspirates. Brook found anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Fusobacterium species predominated among these isolates [47]. Aerobic bacteria were isolated less frequently and included alpha-hemolytic streptococci, S. aureus, and Haemophilus species. In a separate study of acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis, multiple species of anaerobes, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and S. aureus were present [48]. Hsin performed maxillary sinus puncture in 21 children who had four or more weeks of sinus symptoms despite antimicrobial therapy [6]. This study was somewhat limited in that there was no quantitation of bacterial growth and no sterility testing of the puncture site. However, 28 sinus aspirate cultures demonstrated S. pneumoniae (12 aspirates), H. influenzae (7 aspirates), M. catarrhalis (1 aspirate), and no growth in 5 aspirates.",

An alternative hypothesis regarding the importance of bacterial infection in patients with chronic sinusitis relates to the potential role of biofilms (discussed in the 10.1007/978-1-4939-0265-1_7). Biofilms are complex colonies of bacterial cells that live within a glycocalyx matrix attached to a moist surface. Biofilms offer important survival advantages to bacteria. They are more resistant to the effects of antibiotics than free-floating planktonic bacteria. This is accomplished by several mechanisms: (1) greater cell-cell contact to facilitate plasmid exchange for the evolution of resistance, (2) production of beta-lactamases, (3) slow bacterial growth resulting in decreased effect of antibiotics that rely on cell growth and turnover for killing effect, and (4) the presence of \u201cpersister\u201d cells that reform the biofilm when the antibiotic is discontinued [50]. The appeal of the concept of biofilms is that it might explain the chronic nature of the infection, frequent failure to respond to antibiotics, and acute exacerbations when antibiotics are discontinued in patients who had previously responded. Although biofilms have been demonstrated on the mucosa of patients with chronic sinusitis, their precise role remains to be determined as they are not present in all cases of CRS and limited biofilms are present in some healthy controls.",

Although there have been no puncture studies done in children since the 1980s, there is evidence that the prevalence of H. influenzae relative to S. pneumoniae has been increasing since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the United States. In addition, the rate of beta-lactamase production by H. influenzae is increasing in many areas. Thus, selecting an antimicrobial that is beta-lactamase stable or has a beta-lactamase inhibitor is important in treating children with sinusitis. Future studies that address methods of noninvasively detecting bacteria in the sinus would be helpful so that changes in the microbiology may be more readily monitored. Furthermore, additional research is needed to explore the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of AOM in children.",
