For example, our neurosurgical spine service was subdivided into 2 working teams; each team has 2 attending neurosurgeons, 1 resident, and 1 advanced-practice provider (APP). One team self-quarantined from March 23, 2020 until April 6, 2020, wherein they supported the neurosurgical team with outpatient Telemedicine visits and by helping to coordinate and advise upon inpatient care remotely. The inpatient team covers neurosurgical on-call, rounds on patients, and performs emergent surgery when indicated. On April 6, 2020, the teams switched roles. We employed this 14-d cycle due to the early research that has suggested a mean incubation time of the COVID-19 virus to be 6.4 d, ranging in between 2.1 and 11.1 d. 9 We have additional residents available to backfill positions if residents/fellows become infected with the virus and need to quarantine. We have also discussed attending coverage of resident duties.",

Our faculty completed rapid online training for the practice of Telehealth/Telemedicine in accordance with Emory University, industry, and Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, and they all became certified within a few days. Similar to the University of California, San Francisco team, our senior neurosurgical staff created a document to define emergent (surgery to be performed immediately), urgent (surgery to be performed within 24 h), time-sensitive (neurological deficit or other serious issues are expected to occur if surgery is not performed within 4 wk), and elective neurosurgical procedures. 1 This was circulated among our entire neurosurgical team throughout the Emory Healthcare system of hospitals. In an effort to preserve PPE and other human and material hospital resources and to decrease patient exposure to COVID-19, we are performing only urgent and emergent neurosurgical procedures at this time.",

Each resident will rotate a minimum of 1 wk on the Neurological Critical Care team in the month of April, which will allow for the creation of additional ICU beds across our campuses, and allow for neurocritical care APPs and fellows to transfer to medical ICUs to assist in care of COVID-19 patients. Redeploying our residents to the neurocritical care units actually enhances their ongoing education as these activities are part of our specialty and board certification, as opposed to redeployment to an emergency department, labor and delivery, or other services in need of assistance.",

We have employed Zoom Inc (San Jose, California) technology to live-stream our conferences for over a year. We performed our first remote morbidity and mortality conference through a secure-conference Zoom Inc link on April 2, 2020. Additionally, we have live-streamed Congress of Neurological Surgeons-provided video grand rounds and have engaged in lively discussions afterwards. We have also instituted daily spine conferences (Monday-Friday) via Zoom staffed by both our neurosurgery and orthopedic attending spine surgeons and is open to neurosurgery residents and fellows, orthopedic spine fellows and residents, and any interested medical students. Each daily conference will include a lecture and case reviews and is moderated by a rotating schedule of 2 attending physicians. This platform, or similarly positioned technologies, can also be utilized for direct resident and fellow education via remote journal clubs, research meetings, and complex neurosurgical case conferences. Similarly, many society and industry-organized resident and fellow educational events have been transitioned to the virtual meeting space.",

As residents, fellows, and attendings, our focus is typically caring for neurosurgical patients, but now we must gain an education in disaster planning and supply allocation on a hospital and institutional scale. In the throes of this global pandemic with a limited precedent, it is difficult to envision post-COVID-19 medical care. However, this pandemic, like all those throughout the history of humankind, will end. After COVID-19, we will be still faced with challenges and learning-how will we triage our response to those whom care has been delayed? How will we maximize efficiency and costcontrol as we treat this backlog? Perhaps most importantly, how can we contribute to reducing the risk of another similar event in the future?",
