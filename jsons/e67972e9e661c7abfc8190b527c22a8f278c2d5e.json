            "text": "The virus SARS-COV-2 caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO. Currently, over 210 countries and territories have been affected. Careful, well-designed drugs and vaccine for the total elimination of this virus seem to be the need of the hour. In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling studies can be extremely helpful in understanding the efficacy of the drug interventions. These studies can also help understand the role of the crucial inflammatory mediators and the behaviour of immune response towards this novel coronavirus. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we study the invivo dynamics of Covid-19. We initially model and study the natural history, the course of the infection and its dynamics. We then validate the model by generating two-parameter heat plots that represent the characteristics of Covid-19. We also do the sensitivity analysis to identify the sensitive parameters of the system. Lastly, we study the efficacy of drug interventions for Covid-19 by formulating an Optimal Control Problem. The outcomes of these studies are multi-fold. The system admits two steady states: the disease-free equilibrium and the infected equilibrium. The dynamics of the system show that the disease takes its course to one of these steady states based on the reproduction number R 0 . The system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at R 0 = 1. From the sensitivity analysis, it is seen that the burst rate of the virus particles and the natural death rate of the virus are the sensitive parameters of the system. Results from the optimal control studies suggest that the antiviral drugs that target viral replication and the drugs that enhance the immune system response both reduce the infected cells and viral load when taken individually. However, it is observed that these drugs yield the best possible results when administered together. Hence, it is concluded that the optimal control strategy would be to use the combination of both these drugs which not only help in patient's recovery but also reduce the side effects caused to the patient because of the minimal/optimal dosage administered. The results obtained here are inline with some of the clinical findings for Covid-19. This invivo modelling study involving the crucial biomarkers of Covid-19 is the first of its kind and the results obtained from this can be helpful to researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians and doctors who are working in this field.",

Transmission from asymptomatics and through faeco-oral route are also reported. After the entry of virus through droplet infection or through contact transmission from hands to the mucous membrane of mouth, nose or eyes. It is reported that Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) plays crucial role in providing binding site to the viral structural protein(Spike protein-S) on the cell surface and subsequent entry into the host cell [27] . The SARS-CoV-2 have much higher affinity towards ACE-2 receptors as compared with its previous conterparts(SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). The ACE-2 expresses in lung alveolar Type-2 cells(AT2), liver cholangiocytes, colon colonocytes, esophagus, keratinocytes, endothelial cells of ileum, rectum and stomach, and proximal tubules of kidneys. AT2 secret surfactant, which reduces surface tension preventing collapsing of the alveoli and playing crucial role in oxygen diffusion across lungs and blood vessels.Viral antigens are presented by antigen presenting cells(APC) which are Human Leucocyte Antigen(HLA) cytotoxic T cell(also known as T-killer cell, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, CD8+) [18] . The virus enters the cell with fusion of its membranes with host cell and begins transcription with ssRNA acting as template. Synthesis of the viral proteins takes place in the cytoplasm of the pneumocytes, new virus is released by budding and ready to infect new cell which is confirmed by presence of abundent viral antigens in the cytoplasm of the pneumocytes(AT2) in case of SARS-CoV [31] . Viremia (viral particle in the blood/serum) was also noticed by some authors along with very high levels of IL-6 especially among severe cases of Covid-19 illness leading to increase vascular permeability and impairment of organs [10] . Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) is the common immunopathological event for all the aforesaid corona viral diseases.One of the main mechanisms in causation of ARDS is cytokine storm,deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response due to the release of large quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune effector cells. These cytokines are identified as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-2, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2 and chemokines as CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, CXCL-8, CXCL-9, CXCL-10. Severe infections correlated high levels of IL-6, IFN \u03b1, CCL-5, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10 [10, 18] . Also the viral load was noted to be crucial in determining severity of the disease and strongly correlated with the lung injury Murray score [21] . The cytokine storm is a violent attack by the immune system causing ARDS, multi-organ failure and eventually death [18] .",

Now, to simulate the system with controls, we use the Forward-Backward Sweep method stating with the initial values of controls and solve the state system forward in time. Following this we solve the adjoint state system backward in time due to the transversality conditions, using the optimal state variables and initial values of optimal control. Now, using the values of adjoint state variables, the values of optimal control are updated and with these updated control variables, we go through this process again. We continue this till the convergence criterion is met [19] . The positive weights chosen for objective coefficients are A 1 = 80, A 2 = 80, A 3 = 7480. A 3 is chosen high compared to A 1 and A 2 as the effort to stop the viral replication process is higher than the effort to enhance innate immune response as it is already existing in human body. Figure 15 shows the change in the cell population S(t), I(t), V (t) respectively with time. We observed that the susceptible cells reduce and the infected cells increase exponentially due to the increase in viral load over a period of time. Figure 16 shows the behaviour of susceptible cells under all possible combinations of control. We observe that in the presence of immune boosting medication only, there is a slight reduction in the number of susceptible cells getting infected by the virus but when viral replication is prevented the impact is more. Even lesser damage is seen on susceptible cells when all control interventions are applied together.",

The increase in infected cells is slightly lesser in the presence of immunity boosters. There is a huge difference if viral replication preventing medicines are used. Here too, the best results are obtained only when all the controls are applied. The second frame in figure 17 gives detailed view of the cases when only antiviral replication medicines are used and all 3 controls are used. We see that when only control u 2 is used, the infected cells increase slowly, and reduce later but increase again after 20 days. This may be harmful to the patient. When all 3 controls are used, the infected cells reach peak around the 8th day and start decaying then on and even become nearly zero after 30 days. Figure 17 . I under optimal controls u * 1 , u * 2 Figure 18 . V under optimal controls u * 1 , u * 2 In figure 18 the first frame shows the viral load under all combinations of control interventions. When no medication is provided, there is exponential increase in the viral load but when only immunity boosting medication is provided (u 2 = 0), there is a little reduction seen in the increase of viral load. The combinations of both these drug interventions show much better results. From the second frame in figure 18 it can be seen that when only anti-viral replication medication is provided (u 11 = u 12 = 0), the viral load becomes very less by the 5th day but due to the absence of immunity boosters, the viral load tends to increase around 25th day. The best results are shown when all the control interventions are administered together. The detailed view of the figure explains how the viral population tends to become nearly zero around 7th day and remains there throughout. These results are in line with the clinical findings discussed in [6] .",

The first model deals with natural history and the course of infection while the second model incorporates the drug interventions. The results of these studies show that the disease system admits two steady states: one being the disease free equilibrium and the other being the infected equilibrium. The dynamics of the system show that the disease takes it course to one of these states based on the reproduction number R 0 . Specifically when R 0 < 1 the system tends to stabilize around the disease free equilibrium and when R 0 > 1 the system tends to stabilize around the infected equilibrium. The system also undergoes a trans-critical bifurcation at R 0 = 1. This result is inline with the conclusions made at the population level for Covid-19 [16] . From the sensitivity analysis it is seen that the burst rate of virus particles and the natural death rate of the virus are sensitive parameters of the system.

From Positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system(4.2), all solutions are bounded for each bounded control variable in U.Also,the right hand side of the system (4.2) satisfies Lipschitz condition with respect to state variables.Hence, using the positivity and boundedness condition and the existence of solution from Picard-Lindelof Theorem [23] , we have satisfied condition 1.2. U is closed and convex by definition. Also, the system (4.2) is clearly linear with respect to controls such that coefficients are only state variables or functions dependent on time. Hence condition 2 is satisfied.3. Choosing g(u 11 , u 12 , u 2 ) = c(u 2 11 + u 2 12 + u 2 2 ) such that c = min {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 }, we can satisfy the condition 3.Hence there exists a control 3-tuple (u * 11 , u * 12 , u * 2 ) \u2208 U that minimizes the cost function (4.1).",
