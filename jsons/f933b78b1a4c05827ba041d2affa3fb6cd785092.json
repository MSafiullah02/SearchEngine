A review of the initial nine cases of SARS 5 identified in Toronto showed that paramedics were involved in providing care to four of these patients. Most paramedics who contracted SARS were off duty for prolonged periods, primarily due to fatigue and dyspnea on exertion typical of many patients convalescing from SARS. 13 The effect of the chronology of public quarantine notices on the quarantine curves comparing SARS-1 and SARS-2 (Figures 1 and 2, respectively) is remarkable. Overall, the number of paramedics who required quarantine during SARS-1 and SARS-2 (234 vs. 292, respectively) and the total number of quarantine days (1,615 vs. 1,637, respectively) were similar. However, the quarantine curve peaked later in SARS-1 compared with SARS-2 (day 12 vs. day 7, respectively) and lasted longer (30 days vs. 18 days, respectively). Compared with SARS-1, SARS-2 led to a greater To optimize paramedic availability during SARS-2, a WQ program was developed. The WQ program allowed asymptomatic paramedics with a low-risk exposure (i.e., unprotected exposure to a SARS-affected hospital) to continue working, while paramedics with a high-risk exposure (i.e., unprotected exposure to a patient with suspect or probable SARS) were not permitted to work (i.e., they followed HQ). During WQ, all paramedics on duty were required to wear PPE at all times, including those who had no known exposure history. In this way, all on-duty paramedics were protected from each other regardless of their exposure history.",

Between SARS-1 and SARS-2, there was a five-day period during which paramedics were not required to wear PPE based on a World Health Organization declaration that the SARS outbreak had ended. If paramedics had continued to wear PPE during these five days, there would have been no need to quarantine any asymptomatic paramedic with a hospital exposure during SARS-2. A substantial number of paramedics were also quarantined due to unprotected exposure to colleagues who had developed SLS following treatment of patients with SARS or SLS. This emphasizes the need for an EMS system to be able to rapidly identify and notify all paramedics who require quarantine. While under quarantine, 68 paramedics developed SLS, resulting in a great deal of anxiety among paramedics. Included in this group are the three paramedics who developed suspect SARS and paramedics D and E who developed probable SARS after the medical support unit became operational. The medical support unit identified each of these individuals as part of our surveillance program. In addition, the medical support unit played a crucial role in deciding which paramedics required formal medical evaluation and when paramedics were fit to return to duty and providing advice to paramedics regarding concerns about their well-being.",
