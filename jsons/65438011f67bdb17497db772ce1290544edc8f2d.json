First, we suggest a set of generic scientific concepts that have been identified in a systematic annotation process. This set of concepts is utilised to annotate a corpus of scientific abstracts from 10 domains of Science, Technology and Medicine at the phrasal level in a joint effort with domain experts. The resulting dataset is used in a set of benchmark experiments to (a) provide baseline performance for this task, (b) examine the transferability of concepts between domains. Second, we present a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline. Further, we propose the active learning strategy for an optimal selection of instances from among the various domains in our data. The experimental results show that (1) a substantial agreement is achievable by non-experts after consultation with domain experts, (2) the baseline system achieves a fairly high F1 score, (3) active learning enables us to nearly halve the amount of required training data.",

However, the introduction of new scientific concepts occurs at a faster pace than knowledge base curation, resulting in a large gap in knowledge base coverage of scientific entities [1] , e.g. the task geolocation estimation of photos from the Computer Vision field is neither present in Wikipedia nor in more specialised knowledge bases like Computer Science Ontology (CSO) [39] or \"Papers with code\" [36] . Information extraction from text helps to identify emerging entities and to populate knowledge graphs [3] . It then is a first vital step towards a fine-grained research knowledge graph in which research articles are described and interconnected through entities like tasks, materials, and methods.

The inter-coder agreement is measured to ensure the adequacy and quality of concepts. A set of research abstracts has been annotated using these concepts and the results are discussed with experts from the corresponding fields. The resulting dataset serves as a basis to train two baseline deep learning classifiers. In particular, we present an active learning approach to reduce the number of required training data.

Additionally, we employ active learning for an optimal selection of instances, which to our knowledge, is demonstrated for the first time on scholarly text. We find that strategic instance selection gives us the same performance with only about half of the training data.

Graph-based systems, in particular, exploit citation graphs and genes mentioned in the papers [27] .

In this work, we explore the domain-independent annotation of lexical phrasal units indicating scientific knowledge, i.e. scientific concepts, in abstracts from ten different science domains. Since other studies have also shown that non-expert annotations are feasible for the scientific domain, we go for a cost-efficient middle course: annotations by non-experts with scientific proficiency, and consultation with domain-experts. Finally, we explore how well a state-of-the-art deep learning model performs on this novel information extraction task and whether active learning can help to reduce the amount of required training data.

We prefer it over its contemporary, Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) [22] , since it has less computational requirements. The MNLP objective involves greedy sampling of sentences preferring those with the least logarithmic likelihood of the predicted tag sequence output by the CRF tag decoder, normalised by the number of tokens to avoid preferring longer sentences. In our experiments, we found that adding 4% of the data to be the most discriminative selection of classifier performance.

Except for Bio the domain-independent classifier clearly outperforms the domain-specific one in extracting concepts from their respective domains. We attribute this, in part, to the improved span-detection performance. Span-detection merely relies on syntactic regularity, thus the domain-independent classifier can benefit from more training data of other domains. E.g., the CS classifier shows a relative improvement of 49.5% domain-specific F 1 score to 65.9% in the domain-independent setting, which is supported by the enhanced span-detection performance from 73.4% to 82.0% in F 1. Accuracy on token-level also improves from 67.7% to 77.5% F 1 for CS, that is correct labelling of the tokens also benefits from other domains.

Table 6 summarises the results of our correlation analysis. The active learning classifier (AL-trained) has been trained with 52% training data sampled by MNLP since it is the point at which the performance of the full data trained model is surpassed (see Table 5 ). For the domain-specific, domain-independent and AL-trained classifier we observe a strong correlation between F1 and number of concepts per domain (R 0.70, 0.76, 0.68) and a weak correlation between \u03ba and F1 (R 0.20, 0.28, 0.23). Thus, we surmise that the number of annotated concepts in a particular domain has more influence on the performance than the inter-annotator agreement. Table 6 . Inter-annotator agreement (\u03ba) and the number of concept phrases (#) per domain; F1 and std of domain-specific classifiers on their domains; F1 and std of domain-independent and AL-trained classifier on each domain; the right side depicts correlation coefficients (R) of each row with \u03ba and the number of concept phrases The correlation values for the variance are different between the classifier types. For the domain-specific classifier the correlation between \u03ba and std, and the number of concepts per domain and std are slightly positive (R 0.29, 0.28), i.e. the higher the agreement and the size of the domain, the higher the variance of the domain-specific classifier. For the domain-independent classifier, there is no correlation (R 0.11, \u22120.05) and for the AL-trained classifier, the correlations become negative (R \u22120.41, \u22120.72), i.e. higher agreement and more annotated concepts per domain lead to less variance for the AL-trained classifier. In summary, we hypothesise that more diverse training data from several domains lead to better performance and lower variance by introducing an inductive bias.",

During a systematic annotation procedure involving domain experts, we have identified four general core concepts that are relevant across the domains of Science, Technology and Medicine. To enable and foster research on these topics, we have annotated a corpus for the domains. We have verified the adequacy of the concepts by evaluating the human annotator agreement for our broad STM domain corpus. The results indicate that the identification of the generic concepts in a corpus covering 10 different scholarly domains is feasible by non-experts with moderate agreement and after consultation of domain experts with substantial agreement (0.76 \u03ba).",

We also observed a strong correlation between the number of annotated concepts per domain and classifier performance, and only a weak correlation between inter-annotator agreement per domain and the performance. It is assumed that more annotated data positively influence the performance in the respective domain.",

The promising results suggest that we do not need a large annotated dataset for scientific information extraction. Active learning can significantly save annotation costs and enable fast adaptation to new domains.",
