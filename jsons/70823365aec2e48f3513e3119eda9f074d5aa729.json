Coronaviruses synthesize in a first stage a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and multiple proteases, transcribes several subgenomic mRNAs and translates them progressively into viral proteins through several ribosomal pathways: (-1) programmed frameshift, leaky scanning and internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [Plant et al 2005] . Some mRNAs include genes encoding large polypeptide chains, which are cleaved through 3CLpro and PL2pro proteases, producing non-structural proteins as enzymes for catalyzing assembly and packaging of new viruses [Sawicki et al 2007 , Fehr and Perlman 2015 , Oxford et al. 2016 Coronavirus.pro (2019-nCoV) App is a C++ code which simulates Coronavirus replication cycle.

Specially, betacoronaviruses attach to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a membrane protein expressed mainly in the surface of epithelial cells of the pulmonary alveolus [Jia et al 2005] . Once attachment is carried out, viral transmembrane is fused through an endocytotic pathway and viral RNA is released into the cell cytoplasm [Wang et al 2008] . Viral RNA genome is positive stranded, 5' capped and 3'polyadenylated, therefore it can be directly translated into proteins by host-cell ribosomes. Specifically, ORF1 gene contains several non-structural proteins in a polypeptide complex, that once translated, is are catalytically autoprocessed by 3CL/2PL proteases, and assembled into a replicase-transcriptase complex with RNA-dependent RNA activity (RdRp). At this point, several subgenomic mRNAs are produced by transcription and translated into structural (N, M, E and S), non-structural and accessory proteins (AP), assembling new virions. These virus particles are formed on smooth-walled vesicles located between the ER and the Golgi, named as ERGIC (Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Compartment). Once these vesicles fuse with the plasma outer membrane, virions are released to continue infection (see fig 4) . 3. Coronavirus.pro",

Stem-loop SL4b is only present in 2019-nCoV and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, there are several regulatory sequences (RS) with unknown functionality. Stem-loops SL6 and SL7 are placed into the adjacent ORF1 coding region.
