It is highly toxic to humans and animals, accumulating in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. An estimated of 250,000 to 370,000 people die globally from pesticide poisoning each year, and more than 90 % of the patients with acute poisoning have attempted suicide by ingesting PQ [1]. The very high case fatality of PQ is due both to its inherent toxicity and the lack of any effective treatment. The most common cause of death from PQ poisoning is ARDS, the most severe form of ALI, due to an oxidative redox cycling and subsequently inflammation. It is pathologically observed that pulmonary edema, bronchial and alveolar destruction, and ultimately fibrosis in the lungs after PQ poisoning.",

PQ undergoes the redox cycling process and generates a great amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2]. Production of ROS is crucial to the regulation of innate immune responses. ROS regulates activation of redox-regulated transcription factors (nuclear factor\u2013\u03baB (NF\u2013\u03baB) and AP-1) and cytokines production [3, 4], finally causes inflammation and destruction of lung tissue structure.

These inflammasome-activated cytokines belong to the IL-1 cytokine family [6] and play central roles in the propagation of the acute inflammatory response. The NLRP3 inflammasome, one of the inflammasome complexes, has a basic structure consisting of nucleotide-binding-domain, leucine-rich repeat domain containing protein (NLRP), and the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase-1 activator domain), which recruit and activate procaspase-1 [7]. The NLRP3 inflammasome is expressed in many inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, and also activated by many factors including environmental irritants, endogenous danger signals, pathogens, and distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [8, 9]. Moreover, it is proposed that a lot of the cellular signals are responsible for NLRP3 activation, including potassium (K+) efflux, pore formation in cell membranes, lyposomes damage, the elevation of ROS, and damage in the mitochondria [9\u201311].",

            "text": "Paraquat is a very toxic substance for humans and animals. Intoxication with PQ causes severe clinical situations including multiple organ damage. PQ is also a strong pneumotoxicant, especially due to its accumulation in the lung through a polyamine uptake system and to its capacity to induce redox cycling, leading to oxidative stress-related damage. Although the mechanism underlying the development of lung injury by PQ is not clear, previous studies showed that oxidative and inflammatory mediators induced by PQ could result in tissue injury. PQ undergoes cyclic single electron reduction/oxidation through its quaternary ammonium nitrogen atoms and bipyridyl ring, producing ROS and elevating oxidase levels. As an oxidative stress marker, MDA levels in rats lungs induced by PQ were significantly increased in our study. Another marker for neutrophil infiltration, MPO, was also increased in the PQ-induced lungs. On other hand, oxidative stress stimulates inflammation by promoting production and secretion of inflammatory mediators from immune cells. Several cytokines have been identified to be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of PQ poisoning, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, etc. [16, 17]. PQ-induced ROS can activate intracellular transcription factors such as NF\u2013\u03baB [13], thereby enhancing IL-1\u03b2 expression. IL-1\u03b2 can upregulate the expression of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecules essential for the recruit of inflammatory cells to an area of inflammation [18]. In an in vivo experiment, we found that the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in the PQ-poisoning group of rats, BALF increased obviously in a time-dependent manner compared with the control. Meanwhile, these cytokines were mainly secreted by monocytes/macrophages [19], implying that macrophage recruitment may be indispensable for the development of PQ-induced lung damage. It was reported that BALF cells consisted of more than 99 % of macrophages [20]. Therefore, RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were selected for the target in vitro study. PQ decreased RAW264.7 mouse macrophages viability in a dose-dependent fashion and resulted in a significantly increase of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in supernatant of macrophages.",

            "text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome was described to be involved in host responses to a wide variety of pathogens. Many factors including the efflux of intracellular potassium ions [21], nickel (Ni2+) [22], the lysosomal rupture [23], and bacterial RNA [24] could result in NLRP3 activation. NLRP3 was also activated upon mitochondrial damage and release of ROS [25]. This activity was dependent on the mitochondrial voltage-dependent ion channels which facilitate the exchange of ions between the intermembrane space and the cell cytosol. Complex I inhibition with rotenone led to increased mitochondrial ROS production [26]. Similarly, inhibitors of ROS production or scavengers of ROS, including NAD (P) H oxidase inhibitors can suppress NLRP3 activation. In addition, ROS may activate NF\u2013\u03baB signaling pathway, then NF\u2013\u03baB may induce NLRP3 expression and NLRP3 inflammasome activity [19]. NF\u2013\u03baB was transferred from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with the promoter regions of target gene transcription and induced the release of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, pro-IL-l\u03b2, and pro-IL-l8 [27]. These potent pro-inflammatory cytokines were controlled by two checkpoints: transcription as well as maturation and release [28]. Caspase-1-mediated activation and mature of members of the IL-1\u03b2 cytokine family led to the recruitment and the activation of other immune cells, such as neutrophils, at the site of infection and/or tissue damage [29]. Interestingly, the increased production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 was specific to and dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. As previously described [30], PQ-induced redox cycling could generate a great amount of ROS including superoxide anions, NO, and other free radicals, leading to oxidative damage. Meanwhile, PQ can cause intense macrophage activation and leukocyte infiltration in lung, and increase inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes all express NLRP3, suggesting an important role for NLRP3 in primary defense mechanisms of the body [31]. In our study, NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 expression was significantly increased in rats lungs induced by PQ poisoning compared with the control. Meanwhile, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 cytokines production in PQ group were also raised significantly. We considered that PQ generated a great amount of ROS, induced inflammatory cells infiltration, and resulted in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion.",

            "text": "According to the recent reports, the NLRP3 inflammasome played an important role in many disorders such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, acute gout, and several chronic pulmonary diseases [32], except host protection against microbial infection. The NLRP3 inflammasome was required for the development of acute lung injury caused by LPS/mechanical ventilation [33], hyperoxia [34], hemorrhagic shock [35], etc. NLRP3 deletion decreased lung epithelial cell death and caspase-3 levels; attenuated the recruitment of inflammatory cells and elevation of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; suppressed NF\u2013\u03baB levels; and exerted a protective effect against acute lung injury [34]. To verify the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in ALI induced by PQ, its blocker glybenclamide was used in our study. Glybenclamide, a type 2 diabetes drug, is an ATP-sensitive potassium channel inhibitor and can exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome induced by PAMP and DAMP, as well as crystalline substances [14, 36]. Although the mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, evidence suggests that this inhibitor acts downstream of the P2X7 receptor but upstream of NLRP3. It also blocks maturation of caspase-1 and pro-IL-1\u03b2. Glybenclamide has been shown to prevent neutrophil extravasation and accumulation in animal models [37]. Glybenclamide treatment was associated with a survival benefit during lipopolysaccharide induced lethality in mice [14] and also in patients with gram-negative sepsis [38]. In ventilator-induced lung injury model, glybenclamide reduced lung edema, neutrophil influx, and IL-6 levels in BALF. Our results suggested that glybenclamide pretreatment also attenuated lung edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 levels in BALF, reduced the MPO levels in lungs, and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, although there was a downward trend in MDA levels, it was not statistically significant compared with the PQ group (P > 0.05). We considered that the NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide only inhibited inflammation by reducing the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 but did not exert anti-oxidant effects. We also found that the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 from RAW264.7 mouse macrophages treated with paraquat was reduced in vitro after the NLRP3 inflammasome was blocked by glybenclamide. NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 pathways may play important roles in ALI, but the potential mechanism needs to be investigated further.",

            "text": "In previous studies, it was found that mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion was largely dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributed to accelerating caspase-1 maturation and finally resulting in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 over-production. In this study, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18) secretion were induced by PQ in acute lung injury, and both of them were investigated to be involved in the inflammation process. Additionally, the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by using glybenclamide can ameliorate the proinflammatory activity and protect the lung against inflammatory injury induced by PQ in rats. To reconfirm the effect, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secreted from RAW264.7 mouse macrophages treated with PQ were also attenuated by glybenclamide in vitro experiments. In conclusion, PQ can generate ROS and induce IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 secretion via NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 pathway. So, the intracellular danger sensor NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for PQ-induced acute lung injury.",
