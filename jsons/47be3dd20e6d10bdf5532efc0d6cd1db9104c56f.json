Clinical presentation is still not clearly defined, but has been associated with respiratory tract infections (both upper and lower tracts) as well as gastroenteritis in children. 3 It is also commonly seen as a co-infection 3 and found shed in the stool and respiratory secretions of asymptomatic children. 4 However, in recent years, it has been emerged that HBoV alone is pathogenic and can cause disease in immunocompetent children, most commonly presenting with respiratory symptoms, such as wheeze and bronchiolitis. 4 In our patient, there were many potential sources of fever, one being the abdominal collection which was drained. We acknowledge that she was on broad-spectrum antibiotics and hence cultures might be negative. However, her fever persisted for a week after, despite drainage and antibiotics, leading us to conclude HBoV as the most likely pathogen causing her fever. While we recognize HBoV still has unclear clinical significance, in our patient, we think HBoV is most likely pathogenic given the consistent respiratory symptoms, single pathogen isolated, with no other source to explain symptoms.",

Severe diarrhoeal illness was reported in a 9-year-old boy with underlying erythropoietic protoporphyria, who had undergone orthotopic liver transplant and previous stem cell transplant, 9 months and 4 months, respectively, prior to presentation. 9 HBoV has also been shown to cause disseminated illness in a child, post-stem cell transplant. 10 HBoV infection has also been postulated to be related to hepatitis in a child with T-cell immunodeficiency. 11 There are no reports of HBoV-associated respiratory infections in children after liver transplantation.

In post-transplant patients, where immunosuppression is crucial to avoid rejection, there is a need to be vigilant about infections, which can result in poor outcomes. There is a need to be aware of newer emerging viruses which can potentially cause severe disease. Although no specific antiviral therapy is available or required in this setting, identification of the cause of illness post-liver transplant can potentially avoid unnecessary and often expensive investigations.",
