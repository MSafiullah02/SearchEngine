In published series, 44% of patients had fever on admission and 89% developed it subsequently. Cough was present in 68% and fatigue and sputum production in about 25% [2]. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure are common. Mortality rates are particularly high in older people [3]. We describe a case highlighting the need to be alert for non-specific or atypical presentations, which may delay testing, diagnosis and isolation.",

He developed lower respiratory signs and was treated for bacterial pneumonia. His temperature was always below 37.8\u00b0C, the diagnostic criterion for COVID-19. He was managed in three different clinical areas in open six-bedded bays without infection control precautions. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of COVID-19 presenting non-specifically, including with delirium, particularly with signs suggesting infection, so cases are not missed when they fall outside current diagnostic and management guidelines. This has implications for the diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 in frail older people, with potential for spread among healthcare professionals and other patients if the diagnosis is overlooked.",
