            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is ubiquitous in most parts of the world where poultry are reared and is able to spread very rapidly in non-protected birds. It is shed via both the respiratory tract and the faeces, and can persist in the birds and the intestinal tract for several weeks or months. Outdoors, survival of IBV for 56 days in litter has been reported (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008). Although strict biosecurity and working with a one-age system are essential control measures, vaccination is normally required to increase the resistance of the chickens against challenge with IBV strains. This is made more difficult to achieve because IBV exists in the form of many different antigenic or genotypic types, commonly referred to as variants. Being a coronavirus and therefore a single-stranded RNA virus, IBV has an enormous capacity to change both by spontaneous mutation and by genetic recombination (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008). When these events occur with IBV, both are most likely to result in the emergence of new variants if they occur in the hypervariable regions of the spike gene. Whilst many new variants are unable to replicate or survive for only a short time, a few emerge that become of economic importance either worldwide or in restricted geographic areas (see below).",

(1956) in the USA showed that the Connecticut (Conn) isolate of 1951 neither cross-neutralized nor cross-protected with the original Massachusetts (Mass) isolate from the early 1940s. However, a retrospective study (Jia et al., 2002), using monoclonal antibodies and molecular analysis of part of the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein (S) gene, identified non-Mass IBVs among isolates made in the USA as early as the 1940s. Although some of these are found elsewhere, most countries are now known to have their own indigenous variants as well, and this paper will consider the current situation worldwide.",

            "text": "In the USA a number of different IB variants had been identified by the early 1970s, generally on the basis of serological analysis (Hitchner et al., 1966; Hopkins, 1974; Cowen & Hitchner, 1975; Johnson & Marquardt, 1976). Hofstad (1961, 1981) showed a poor level of cross-protection between several of them. New variants continued to be identified and poor cross-protection was shown (Gelb et al., 1981). In a survey using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for typing, Jackwood et al. (2005) identified 82 different IB variants among 1523 submissions to their laboratory over an 11-year period. As the number of variants identified in the USA increased, a few were shown to be both widely distributed and of major economic importance. Possibly the most significant of these was the variant known as Arkansas (Ark) (Fields, 1973); its importance quickly being recognized by the development of live-attenuated vaccines from this strain (Gelb & Cloud, 1983). Vaccines developed from Mass, Conn and Ark IBVs are widely used in the USA, either singly or in combination (e.g. a combined Mass\u2013Conn commercial product) and these vaccines have also proved beneficial in providing adequate cross-protection against other IB variants including California 99 (Alvarado et al., 2003), thereby indicating the possibility of cross-protection between IBVs. The Ark serotype continued to be of economic importance in the main poultry-producing areas, including Georgia and Delmarva (Gelb et al., 1983). By the mid-1990s, the availability of molecular diagnostic methods led to the identification of subtypes or \u201cquasi-species\u201d within the Ark serotype (Nix et al., 2000; Jackwood et al., 2005). However, suggestions that the currently available Ark vaccines were providing incomplete protection against more recent isolates of this serotype were discounted by Sander et al. (1997), who demonstrated that poor protection was more likely to be due to poor vaccine application than to antigenic drift in the virus in the field. This finding, supported by the recent work of Jackwood et al. (2009), confirms the importance of careful application of IB vaccines.",

DE072 increased in incidence throughout the next decade, also causing major disease problems in vaccinated flocks in Georgia (Lee et al., 2001). It has apparently undergone both genetic drift and recombination (Lee & Jackwood, 2000, 2001a), such that DE072 vaccines provide only poor protection against field strains, and molecular analysis of field isolates has led to the recognition of a new IB variant, designated Georgia 98 (GA98) (Lee et al., 2001). A homologous vaccine was developed from the Georgia 98 (GA98) strain that provided adequate protection after two applications against a homologous challenge but also against a DE072 challenge (Jackwood et al., 2003). Recently, a new IBV variant designated GA08, for which existing vaccines were not protective, was detected in the same region (Jackwood et al., 2010). Genetic analyses, serotyping and cross-protection trials with strains from California have now shown that different parts of the USA can have their own IBV variants and have confirmed that new ones continue to emerge (Jackwood et al., 2007).",

In a study carried out in the mid-1990s, IBV isolates of at least five different antigenic types were found in commercial chickens of all types throughout Brazil, but mainly in the major poultry-producing area of the south (Di Fabio et al., 2000). Several different genotypes have now been identified in Brazil by analysis of either the S1 gene (Montassier et al., 2006, 2008; Villarreal et al., 2007a, 2007b) or the nucleoprotein (N) gene (Abreu et al., 2006), but protection studies have not been performed. More recently it has been shown (Villarreal et al., 2010) that both a unique cluster of IBV strains (subdivided into three subclusters) as well as the 4/91 genotype currently co-exist in that country. It is important to remember that in Brazil, as in many other parts of the world, the only live attenuated IB vaccines licensed for use are of the Mass serotype and that protection studies (Cook et al., 1999; Di Fabio et al., 2000) showed that the currently available Mass vaccine provided inadequate protection against some of the Brazilian variants.",

(1976) reported the first isolation of IB (Mass serotype) in Chile in 1975 and variants were reported for the first time there some 10 years later (Hidalgo et al., 1986). By the mid-1980s, IB was reported as a serious problem in commercial chicken flocks and novel variants as well as the Mass and Conn serotypes were isolated from broiler and layer flocks, and again Mass vaccines were found to protect poorly against challenge with these variants (Cubillos et al., 1991). Elsewhere in Latin America a variant IBV was isolated from commercial chickens in Honduras in 1997 and poor protection against Mass vaccines was demonstrated (Cook et al., 1999). Following the isolation of the Ark serotype in Mexico in the early 1990s (Quiroz et al., 1993), the use of molecular methods subsequently identified IBV variants unique to that country in commercial chickens (Escorcia et al., 2000; Callison et al., 2001; Gelb et al., 2001). They were shown by neutralization tests to be different from Mass or Conn serotypes, but in vivo protection studies were not performed. Rather surprisingly, IBV variants do not appear to have been reported in Argentina until very recently when Rimondi et al. (2009), using only molecular techniques, detected three unique genotype clusters (in addition to Mass and Conn); one of these was closely related to isolates from Brazil. Similar techniques had been used a few years earlier to identify for the first time a genetically unique IB variant in Colombia (Alvarado et al., 2005).",

Then Dawson & Gough (1971) reported the detection of IBV variants in the UK and workers at the Doorn Institute in The Netherlands isolated IBVs belonging to at least four different IBV serotypes associated with disease outbreaks in Mass-vaccinated commercial flocks (Davelaar et al., 1984). These IBVs belonged to novel serotypes\u2014D207 (also known as D274), D212 (better known as D1466), D3896 and D3128\u2014and experimental data showed that existing IB vaccines protected poorly against them. Vaccines were developed using some of these variants, with several still in use today. The development in the UK of techniques that made use of tracheal organ cultures for both the isolation and serotyping of IBVs (Cook, 1984; Cook & Huggins, 1986) resulted in increased interest in the detection of new IB variants.

However, occasionally a variant that caused major disease outbreaks did occur. One example of this is the IB variant B1648, mainly associated with renal problems in vaccinated flocks in Belgium and neighbouring countries for a relatively short period in the 1990s (Lambrechts et al., 1993; Pensaert & Lambrechts, 1994). However, of major importance internationally was the variant called variously 4/91, 793B and CR88 (here named 4/91) (Gough et al., 1992; Parsons et al., 1992; Le Gros, 1998) that emerged in the 1990s, associated with major welfare and economic problems in apparently well-vaccinated flocks. IB 4/91 quickly spread to many parts of the world and necessitated the development of live-attenuated IB vaccines to control it. This virus continues to be a major concern in poultry of all ages in many parts of the world, but interestingly has not been reported in the USA.",

            "text": "More recently, the use of RT-PCR technology has led to an increase in the detection of novel IB variants in Europe (Worthington et al., 2008). However, it is important to remember that detecting an IB variant by molecular methods does not necessarily mean that the virus concerned is causing major disease problems. This can be illustrated by the IB variant Italian 02 (It-02). This virus appears to be easily detected by RT-PCR (Jones et al., 2005; Dolz et al., 2006) but is difficult to isolate, and its association with widespread disease outbreaks remains to be established. On the other hand, the variant QX IBV is easy to detect by RT-PCR, is readily isolated and is associated with major disease outbreaks in many areas. This virus, first reported associated with proventriculitis in China in the late 1990s (Yu et al., 2001), spread throughout Russia (Bochkov et al., 2006), and then appeared in much of Europe (Beato et al., 2005; Landman et al., 2005; Benyeda et al., 2009). It is associated with nephritis and respiratory distress in broilers and with the so-called \u201cfalse layer syndrome\u201d and drops in egg production in breeders and layers. It is therefore causing major economic problems in IB-vaccinated flocks. Although no homologous vaccine was available until very recently, some success is reported in controlling its effects using currently available IB vaccines (De Wit et al., 2006, 2009; Worthington & Jones, 2006; Terregino et al., 2008; De Wit & Van de Sande, 2009).",

Subsequently, variants related to Mass, other European IBVs and one related to an Israeli variant have been identified by genome analysis in that country (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006). Bourogaa et al. (2009) used both molecular methods and cross-neutralization tests to identify IBV isolates from Tunisia as variants that are closely related to ones found in Europe. In the early 1980s the unusual enterotropic variant, known as IB \u201cG\u201d, was isolated in Morocco (El-Houadfi & Jones, 1985; El-Houadfi et al., 1986). Interestingly, S1 sequence data have shown that IBV G and 4/91 are very closely related, possibly with a common origin (Jones et al., 2004). The suggestion was made that parts of Africa, where variants have been little studied, might be a reservoir for such viruses, although the increasing number of variants being reported in other countries, such as Brazil and China, indicate that several such reservoirs might exist. More recently, El-Bouqdaoui et al. (2005) used RT-PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques to study outbreaks of nephritis associated with IB in Morocco, where Mass and 4/91 vaccines have been used since 1960 and 2000, respectively. Three novel genotypes were identified, against which Mass vaccines provided poor protection.",

In Malaysia, where IBV was first isolated in 1967, variants have been present since at least 1979 (reported by Lohr, 1988). More recently, molecular epidemiological studies of IBVs isolated in Malaysia and Singapore showed that whilst some were of the Mass serotype (probably identical to the H120 vaccine), others were similar to IBVs reported from China and Taiwan (Yu et al., 2001b). These studies led the authors to suggest that IBV variants have existed in Asia for some time. This finding was substantiated by Zulperi et al. (2009) who used sequence and phylogenetic analysis to study two variants isolated in Malaysia, 10 years apart. One was similar to several Chinese variants whilst the other was characterized as unique to Malaysia, but no protection studies were performed. IB has been a problem in Thailand since the 1950s, despite the use of many different IB vaccines, and a recent molecular study by Pohuang et al. (2009) has identified two groups of IBV variants in Thailand by phylogenetic analysis of the SI gene: Group I appeared to be unique to that country, whilst Group II showed a close relationship to Chinese IBVs, including variant A2 (see below).",

(1998) classified 40 IBV isolates into Mass plus four local genotypes, one of which was not only the predominant type but, in pathogenicity studies, caused 50% mortality in specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks inoculated at 1 day old. More recent studies (Lee et al., 2004) have extended this work and reported further genetic diversity amongst Korean IBV variants isolated from diseased flocks; some of which are indigenous to Korea, whilst others share genetic relationships with IBV variants from other countries in the region (Lee et al., 2008).

One group, present in Japan since at least the 1960s, may be found only in Japan, whilst the other two, which were more recent, are related to Chinese and Taiwanese variants (see below). These groups were distinct from those found in Europe or the USA, although the 4/91 serotype has been isolated in Japan (Mase et al., 2008; Shimazaki et al., 2008). The origin of these variants is not clear, but Shieh et al. (2004) reported the close relationship of isolates from Taiwan and Japan to IBVs found in Australia and the USA, and suggested that the Asian variants are recombinants; their S gene being derived from Australian variants and the N genes from US strains.

However, by the mid-1990s this was clearly no longer the case and in the past decade many published reports have revealed the diversity of IBVs causing disease in that country. By means of in vivo studies and antigenic typing using monoclonal antibodies and cross-neutralization tests, Wu et al. (1998) identified highly pathogenic variant IBVs in China associated with both respiratory disease and nephritis and showed that H120 vaccine provided poor protection against challenge with these isolates. Possibly the most significant IBV variant worldwide to have emerged from China is the QX variant reported by YuDong et al. (1998) in association with proventriculitis (see above). Another IBV genotype Q1 has also been associated with proventriculitis (Yu et al., 2001a). However, it remains unclear whether the problems with proventriculitis that were associated with the detection of QX or Q1 strains were really caused by the IBV infection or by another factor because local replication of the IBV strain in the proventriculis was not shown. In a recent study of 26 IBVs isolated between 1985 and 2008 from a variety of disease conditions in the Guangxi region of China, Wei et al. (2009) identified four clusters on the basis of RT-PCR analysis of the N gene. They were grouped into seven serotypes by neutralization tests, but there was poor correlation between the results of genotyping and serotyping. In an analysis of the genome of 26 IB variants isolated from the kidneys, proventriculus and oviduct in different areas of China between 1995 and 2004, Liu et al. (2006) identified Mass type IBVs plus five genotypes apparently found only in China and co-circulating there. One of these (genotype A2) was subsequently shown to be the dominant indigenous type in China at that time (Liu et al., 2009b), although more recently, based on analysis of S1 gene sequences, Zou et al. (2010) have reported that a different genotype, designated LX4, is now dominant. Others showed close relationships with either Korean or Taiwanese IBV variants, and one was closely related to an Australian isolate (Liu et al., 2006). Cuiping et al. (2007) identified the 4/91 variant in China, along with the Australian T strain, as well as one variant indigenous to China. Thus the diversity of IB variants in China is now well established, some being restricted to and co-circulating in that country, whilst others show similarities with IBV variants identified in other countries in the region.",

Using both monoclonal antibodies directed against the major IBV proteins and sequencing studies, several distinct lineages have now been recognized (Ignjatovic et al., 1997, 2006), all different from those found elsewhere. Ignjatovic et al. (2002) in a study comparing the pathogenicity of 25 Australian IBV strains isolated between the 1960s and 1990s found that, of 12 IBVs isolated between 1961 and 1976, nine were nephropathogenic, whilst only three of 13 strains isolated between 1981 and 1994 were associated with nephritis. They suggested that this indicated a change in the prevalent IBV strains from highly nephropathogenic (1960s to 1970s) to respiratory (1980s to early 1990s). Their work also indicated the emergence in the late 1980s of respiratory strains with altered tissue tropism in Australia. It does not appear to be clear as yet whether similar changes in pathogenicity have occurred in other parts of the world.",

The reason why some strains spread readily over major parts of the world whereas others remain more local is unknown. Variants of major importance in major parts of the world, such as 4/91 or QX that have spread over Asia, Europe and Africa in a short period, have not been reported in, for example, the USA or Australia. On the other hand, the major strain of the USA, the Arkansas strain has hardly been reported outside the USA. A pathogenic strain like D1466 that has been in some countries in Western Europe for three decades now has hardly been reported outside Western Europe, although it is very difficult to achieve a sufficient level of protection (Cook et al., 1999) against this strain, which would make it easier for the strain to spread to other areas. It seems likely that geographical isolation and control measures employed in countries may play a part in preventing entry of IBV variants. The recent discoveries of IBV and IBV-like strains in species of birds other than the chicken (Cavanagh, 2005), such as geese, ducks, and pigeons, might also play a role in the spread of IBV strains over the world. Specific IBV strains that were able to infect another bird species, especially if it is a migratory bird, would spread more easily over long distances than a strain that could not replicate in that bird species. An unknown IBV-like virus that might be common in a migratory bird could infect the poultry industry in different parts of the world, leaving us with the mystery of how this new virus spread so fast within the poultry industry. Although the role of the wild birds in the world of IBV is largely unknown and speculative, it is certainly an area that deserves more attention and research.",

On the other hand, IB viruses of different serotypes and genotypes not only have different epitopes, but also share common epitopes that are of importance in cross-immunity (Cavanagh et al., 1992, 1997) and cell-mediated immune responses (Boots et al., 1992; Ignjatovic & Galli, 1995). These features of the IB virus result in a disadvantage of genotyping for use in the field, as direct translation of information about usually only a part of the genome (generally a part of the S gene) of an IBV strain to biological function or antigenicity of the virus is not possible or is not without risk. Despite these limitations, there are reports that the S1 gene sequence comparison (part of 700 nucleotides) is a better predictor of challenge of immunity in chickens than serotyping by virus neutralization (Ladman et al., 2006). Whether this is a general rule is unknown, as only a small number of strains and vaccines have been compared, and also different parts of the S1 gene were used for the comparison of the homology. In general, however, a lower homology in sequence of the S1 subunit of two strains (e.g. a vaccine and a field strain) means a greater chance that relevant mutations have occurred, which might result in a lower cross-protection.",

However, these data also show that the relationship is not very strong. Some strains that differ by only a few percent from other strains in the sequenced part of the genome showed a significant drop in cross-protection (Meir et al., 2004; Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006), whereas there was a high level of cross-protection against other strains with a much lower homology (Meir et al., 2004). Figure 2 also shows the wide variation in level of cross-protection that is detected for strains with the same level of homology in comparison with the strains that are used as vaccine. Another limitation that needs to be considered is the different size and location of the S1 region of the S gene that different laboratories and research groups use for their analyses of the level of homology (De Wit et al., 2010a). Several laboratories sequence a part of S1 that includes the highly variable regions 1 and 2; others do not. Analysis of different parts of S1 can result in different levels of homology leading to different conclusions regarding the relationship between virus strains. An example is shown in Table 1 and Figures 3, 4, and 5. For this analysis the sequences of four IBV strains of different genotypes and serotypes, as published by Adzhar et al. (1997), were used. The homology of the four strains\u20147/91 (genotype 4/91), H120 (Mass serotype), D274 and D1466\u2014was compared for nucleotides 1 to 1600 of the S1 region of the S gene. The extent of nucleotide identity between the strains was expressed on nucleotide level as follows: score 100% when all four strains had the same nucleobase (in the copy DNA); score 75% when three out of four strains had the same nucleobase; score 50% when two strains had the same nucleobase and the two other strains had another nucleobase in common; score 25% when two strains had the same nucleobase and the two other strains each had another different nucleobase; and score 0% when all strains had a different nucleobase at that position of the genome. In this comparison, a missing nucleotide (by deletion) was considered to be a different nucleobase. Table 1 shows the overview of the comparison. When windows of 10 nucleotides were used for the comparison of the four strains, the average homology of the four strains could have been 42.5% but also 100% based on the location of the 10 nucleotides that have been used for the comparison. When windows of 100 nucleotides were used for the comparison of the four strains, the average homology of the four strains could have been 68.0% but also 86.8% based on the location of the 100 nucleotides that were used for the comparison. When windows of 400 nucleotides were used for the comparison, the average homology of the four strains varied from 73.2 to 81.6% based of the location of the 400 nucleotides that were used for the comparison.\n\n\n\n\n",

The detected homology with other strains is then very dependent on the part of the genome that is being used for the comparisons of the homology. Using larger parts of S1 for the comparison of strains results in a decreased risk of finding high levels of homology between strains where in fact this is not really the case. In the field situation there is another limitation on the predictive value of a vaccine against the field challenge strain based on the homology in the S1 gene. In many countries, IBV vaccines are used that are a combination of two strains, or the vaccination programme contains two vaccinations with two (or more) different IBV strains. The level of cross-protection then depends on the efficacy of the combination of strains, which makes it impossible to determine a level of homology between the field strain and the \u201cvaccine strain\u201d.",

Often there is a partial protection against strains of other protectotypes, serotypes or genotypes that can vary from high to low (Figure 2 and reviewed for the H-strain by Bijlenga et al. [2004]). The magnitude and duration of the response to vaccination is dependent on many factors, including age of the chick, levels of maternal immunity, immunogenicity of the vaccine, method of vaccine application, virulence of the field strain challenge, interval between vaccination and challenge and immunocompetency of the host. Chickens vaccinated under optimal conditions may have immunity lasting many months and for broilers, this may be life-long (Bijlenga et al., 2004).",

This means that this well-vaccinated chicken is also protected against an early revaccination with a homologous vaccine (Davelaar & Kouwenhoven, 1980). Despite this, revaccination of young birds, especially broilers, using a vaccine of the same serotype as the first vaccine has proven to be beneficial under field conditions. This is an indication that the quality of the first vaccination might need careful attention. Whatever live vaccine is used, the application is a very critical step. IBV virus is a sensitive virus that can be inactivated easily (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008), which may result in inadequate efficacy of the vaccination under field conditions (Jackwood et al., 2009; De Wit et al., 2010b). The vaccine may be applied by eye drop or nasal drop, spray or drinking water routes and it is essential that a high percentage of the birds receive a required dose of the vaccine in the right tissue. Inadequate \u201ctake\u201d of the vaccine may result in no or a decreased level of protection, delayed protection, or prolonged presence/circulation of the vaccine virus in the flock, resulting in an increased risk of infections with Escherichia coli or other bacteria (Goren, 1978; Hopkins & Yoder, 1984; Smith et al., 1985; Cook et al., 1986; Matthijs et al., 2003) and even increase of virulence of the virus (Hopkins & Yoder, 1986).",

The efficacy of increasing the level of protection against heterologous challenges in the laying period has rarely been reported (De Wit et al., 2009), although birds that had been vaccinated twice with a live Mass-type vaccine and boosted with a killed oil-emulsion vaccine containing a Mass strain showed no protection against challenge with a strain of the Ark type (Muneer et al., 1987b).",

Whilst genotyping has advantages of ease and speed, the different sizes and locations of the part of the S1 region of the S gene that are used by different groups for the comparison of strains makes interpretation of results very difficult, and the present review emphasizes the need for a standardized method of performing genotyping. Another major point that needs to be remembered is that only the vaccinated chicken decides whether genetic or antigenic differences as shown by genotyping or serotyping are relevant for the level of cross-protection in that bird.",
