In antiviral RNAi, viral infection and replication generates virus-derived dsRNA (vi-dsRNA), which could be recognized and cleaved by the host en-doribonuclease Dicer into virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs). These vsiRNAs are integrated into the Argonaute protein within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to direct the destruction of cognate viral RNAs in infected cells in a sequence-specific manner. As a countermeasure, viruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize the RNAi pathway at different steps. For example, Influenza A virus (IAV) NS1, human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 3A and Dengue virus 2 (DENV2) NS2A have been identified to act as VSRs to inhibit vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response in the context of viral infections (Qiu et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2018) . Thus, the understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with antiviral RNAi is important for the better knowledge of this novel coronavirus, and may contribute to the efforts of controlling the spread of infections and developing effective therapies.",

Given the high homology (94%) of the amino acid sequences among coronavirus N proteins ( Figure S1 in Supporting In-formation), it is intriguing to examine whether SARS-CoV -2 N also has the VSR activity. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the role of SARS-CoV-2 N in the suppression of RNAi in cultured human cells. We first examined whether SARS-CoV-2 N possessed VSR activity via a classic reversal-of-silencing assay, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-specific shRNA was transfected into EGFP-expressing 293T cells, together with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 N protein with Flag tag. At 48 h posttransfection (hpt), EGFP protein levels were examined via fluorescent microscopy and Western blotting. EGFP-specific shRNA expression resulted in low EGFP protein levels ( Figure 1A , panel \"Vec\"; Figure 1B , lane 2), confirming the efficiency of shRNA in this RNAi system. Our data showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 N markedly restored the protein level of EGFP ( Figure 1A Because RNAi directly results in the cleavage and degradation of target mRNAs, we further examined the VSR activity of SARS-CoV-2 N using the reversal-of-silencing system via Northern blotting with a digoxin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe targeting EGFP ORF 1-400 nt. Our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 N markedly restored the EGFP mRNA levels in 293T cells ( Figure 1C ). Together, our data show that SARS-CoV-2 N protein has the VSR activity in cultured human cells.",

During the dsRNA/shRNAinduced RNAi, dsRNA/shRNA is initially recognized and cleaved by Dicer into siRNA. Thus, we examined whether SARS-CoV-2 N can sequestrate dsRNA via the RNA-IP assay. In brief, 293T cells expressing Flag-tagged N or empty vector, together with EGFP-specific dsRNA (EGFP ORF 1-200 nt) were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or mouse IgG antibodies, respectively. The RNAs extracted from the RNA-IP precipitates were then examined via Northern blotting using RNA probes targeting the 1-200 nt dsRNA of EGFP. Our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 N does associate with dsRNA in 293T cells ( Figure 1D ), implying that the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N suppresses RNAi is to sequestrate dsRNA in cells, which probably prevents the recognition and cleavage of viral dsRNA by Dicer.",

After establishing that SARS-CoV -2 N can associate with dsRNA, we further examined whether SARS-CoV-2 N could also suppress siRNA-induced RNAi. To this end, we co-transfected SARS-CoV-2 N expression vector and chemically synthesized EGFP-specific siRNA into 293T cells expressing EGFP. The effects of RNAi were determined via fluorescent microscopy ( Figure  1E ), Western blotting to detect EGFP protein expression ( Figure 1F ), or via Northern blotting to detect EGFP mRNA level ( Figure 1G ). EGFP-specific siRNA reduced the protein and mRNA levels of EGFP, while the ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 N efficiently restored the expression of EGFP in both the protein and mRNA levels ( Figure 1F and G). EBOV VP35 was used as a positive control ( Figure 1F and G). Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 N can suppress siRNA-induced RNAi in cells, implying that SARS-CoV -2 N antagonizes RNAi in the effector step, either.

Moreover, the residues Lys 258 and Lys 262 that were shown to be critical for the VSR activity of SARS-CoV N were also conserved within N protein of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information). In addition to N protein, previous study has identified that SARS-CoV 7a could suppress RNAi in mammalian cells (Karjee et al., 2010) , suggesting that coronaviruses may antagonize RNAi by encoding multiple VSRs. Considering the high homology of the amino acid sequences of 7a proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 7a may also contain the VSR activity. Encoding multiple VSRs may offer these pathogenic viruses extra advantages for efficient inhibition of RNAi, highlighting the importance of antiviral RNAi for host cells in defending viral infection.",
