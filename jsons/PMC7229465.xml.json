One study found that psychiatric disorders were found in 50.2% for PLWHA in Iran and only 22% had received minimally adequate treatment (Shadloo et al., 2018). In China, one study has shown that the major needs of symptom management were rash, shortness of breath, and blurred vision (Fu, 2014). Chen, Shiu, et al. (2013) have also reported that Chinese HIV-positive individuals experienced digestive discomfort, skin rashes, numbness, memory loss, nightmares, and dizziness, along with depressive mood.",

This measure has been widely used and adapted from a pre-established survey (Holzemer, Hudson, Kirksey, Hamilton, & Bakken, 2001; Justice et al., 2001). Symptoms that were highly related to HIV (e.g., fatigue, fever, rash, diarrhea, and depression) were included in the questionnaire. Patients indicate for the previous four weeks what symptoms were present along with the symptom severity. If a symptom was present, then participants rate the degree of the need for symptom management (0 = No demand, 1 = Weak demand, 2 = Moderate demand, 3 = Strong demand). They then answer a follow-up question on whether their needs have been met (Yes/No/Not asked). Sample questions are: During the last 4 weeks, did you need help from HCPs to relieve your symptom of rash? If the answer is yes, then, the follow-up question is: During last 4 weeks, did you get the help from the HCP that you asked for? Patients who responded no to the latter question are identified as having an unmet need for that symptom (score = 1). The scores of the total unmet needs for symptom management range from 0 to 49, with higher scores indicating more unmet needs. The instrument has been shown to have good expert validity with a content validity index (CVI) of 0.918 and Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the needs and unmet needs domains at 0.968 and 0.954, respectively (Zhu, Hu, Guo, & Williams, 2019).",

A study conducted with 190 newly diagnosed PLWHA in two hospitals in Beijing found that 42% patients request more medical attention for fatigue (Cai, 2017). However, fatigue is often overlooked and gets less attention from HCPs (Chen, Lee, et al., 2013). All of these studies strongly suggested that HCP in China should deliver a feasible and individually tailored intervention to combat fatigue, more rest or increasing exercise level should be considered for different individuals.",

When some HCPs mistreated PLWHA by categorizing them as \u201ccontagious,\u201d PLWHA were discouraged from returning to those unfriendly providers (Alexandra, Brewington, Kathryn, Hayness, & Zaller, 2017). Also, perceived stigma can discourage them from seeking healthcare services and can delay their disclosure of their HIV status to HCP and their family members (Zhang, Miege, & Zhang, 2011). Social stigma especially is a barrier to seeking healthcare in the MSM population (Pilgrim et al., 2019). Thus, intervention to decrease HIV-related stigma in the society is urgent. While HCP delivering care to PLWHA, HCP should also use motivate interview skills to decrease stigma in PLWHA. Surveys assessing personal values regarding infectious disease, and especially HIV, should be conducted by all HCPs. Understanding HCPs' attitude toward PLWHA is key to providing quality care in this population. Those providers who are not perceived as kind and caring by PLWHA should be replaced.",

Positive relationships with HCP enhance self-management capacity, leading to better ART adherence and consequently, enhanced CD4 counts and stronger immune function. As a result of improved relationships PLWHA experience fewer symptoms and may not need additional care (Chen et al., 2018). Effective self-management is considered critical to quality of life (Chen, Shi, & Li, 2013). Previous research reports that self-management interventions are effective at improving PLWHA's pain and physical symptoms (Millard et al., 2016; Nkhoma, Seymour, & Arthur, 2015). However, with multiple comorbidities, PLWHA will need more assistance in keeping up all the self-management strategies (Coventry, Fisher, Kenning, Bee, & Bower, 2014). Therefore, HCPs should pay more attention to how patients to manage their unpleasant symptoms (Wang, Li, et al., 2016).",

Third, this study was conducted in a metropolitan area in China, where patients have better access to healthcare services compared to PLWHA in more resourced-limited areas. Therefore, the results should not be generalized to other geographic areas in China. Fourth, symptom burden, current employment status, self-management capacity, and HIV perceived stigma explained only 38% of the total variance in unmet symptom management needs. The unexplained variance of the unmet needs for future studies to go beyond the factors investigated in the current project.

To minimize unmet symptom management needs, future interventions should focus on improving symptom burden, decreasing HIV perceived stigma, and increasing self-management capacity. The study findings highlight that PLWHA experienced more unmet psychological symptom management needs in Shanghai, China. Therefore, it is urgent to tackle the barriers that influence PLWHA's behavior toward their psychological symptom management. Besides, it is necessary to train HCPs who are working with PLWHA on identification of mental health symptoms and to refer PLWHA to mental health care providers. With better understanding of PLWHA's unmet symptom management needs, HCP can design a tailored intervention for PLWHA. In addition, considering the long-term and the chronic nature of HIV infection, further study should consider assessing other potential factors such as social support (family, HCPs).",
