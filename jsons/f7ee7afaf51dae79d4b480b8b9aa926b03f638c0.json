We have previously shown that inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway reduces IAV infection. In this study, we aimed to identify antiviral human microRNAs (miRNAs) that target the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. Using a miRNA expression library, we identified 85 miRNAs that up-regulated and 20 miRNAs that down-regulated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. Fifteen miRNAs were validated to up-regulate and five miRNAs to down-regulate the pathway. Overexpression of four selected miRNAs (miR-193b, miR-548f-1, miR-1-1, and miR-509-1) that down-regulated the Wnt/\u03b2catenin signalling pathway reduced viral mRNA, protein levels in A/PR/8/34-infected HEK293 cells, and progeny virus production. Overexpression of miR-193b in lung epithelial A549 cells also resulted in decreases of A/PR/8/34 infection. Furthermore, miR-193b inhibited the replication of various strains, including H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/ 33, A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and H3N2 (A/Oklahoma/309/2006), as determined by a viral reporter luciferase assay. Further studies revealed that \u03b2-catenin was a target of miR-193b, and \u03b2-catenin rescued miR-193b-mediated suppression of IAV infection. miR-193b induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and delayed vRNP nuclear import. Finally, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of miR-193b to the lung reduced viral load in mice challenged by a sublethal dose of A/PR/8/34. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-193b represses IAV infection by inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling.

IAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and has a segmented, negative-sense, and singlestranded RNA genome. Although vaccines remain a major means of prevention, a significant amount of time is required to develop and produce an effective vaccine against a new virus strain (Soema, Kompier, Amorij, & Kersten, 2015) . Furthermore, vaccines need to be reformulated annually due to the frequent emergence of new viruses (Houser & Subbarao, 2015) . Antiviral drugs, on the other hand, are essential for treatment and prophylaxis. However, the error-prone nature of the influenza RNA polymerase, due to its lack of proofreading-repair activity, makes the virus highly susceptible to mutation, resulting in its resistance to antivirals (Watanabe et al., 2014) . For example, there has been rapid emergence of IAV strains that are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and these antivirals are thus no longer recommended for anti-influenza treatment (Barr et al., 2007; Bright et al., 2005) . Resistance against neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir as well as newly developed peramivir and laninamivir, has also been reported (Barrett & McKimm-Breschkin, 2014; Hurt et al., 2009; Kamali & Holodniy, 2013; Orozovic, Orozovic, Jarhult, & Olsen, 2014) .

(2003) discovered that efficient IAV propagation depends on the activation of host caspase-3, a central player in apoptosis, as the presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor in cells strongly impairs viral replication. Several studies have shown that IAV stabilises the p53 protein, activates p53 signalling and consequently induces apoptosis in host cells (Nailwal, Sharma, Mayank, & Lal, 2015; Turpin et al., 2005; Zhirnov & Klenk, 2007) .

Identification of miRNAs that interfere with IAV replication by modulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin will provide new insights into the miRNA-Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling-IAV interaction network. In the present study, using miRNA library screening, we identified 15 and five miRNAs that up-and down-regulated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling, Table S1 ). Furthermore, four miRNAs (miR-193b, miR-548f-1, miR-1-1, and miR-509-1) that down-regulated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway were shown to suppress IAV replication and virus production. miR-193b, which reduced All of the four miRNAs that inhibit Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling reduced viral protein levels.

It is likely that, in addition to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling, these miRNAs also target other pathways. Among the down-regulating miRNAs, miR-193b was the most effective suppressor of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. miR-193b is considered to be a biomarker of various cancers because it is down-regulated in lung cancer (H.

By contrast, Baril et al. (2013) reported that infection by SeV, another negative-strand RNA virus, induces secretion of Wnt ligands and stabilisation of \u03b2-catenin and decreases expression of IFNB1 via a feedback mechanism. Our study showed that the reduction of \u03b2-catenin by miR-193b indeed hampered IAV replication and that compensating \u03b2-catenin by \u03b2-catenin ectopic expression restored IAV infection (Figure 7) . Similarly, Watanabe et al. showed that downregulation of \u03b2-catenin significantly decreased the relative viral RNA polymerase activity by more than 50% (Watanabe et al., 2014) . LEF1 is also a target of miR-193b. However, LEF1 co-overexpression with miR-193b plasmid did not rescue the miR-193b-mediated reduction of IAV infection. LEF1 forms a complex with \u03b2-catenin to activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin responsive genes. Two reports have shown that whereas overexpressing LEF1 alone does not activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, coexpression of LEF1 and \u03b2-catenin results in 50-to 100-fold increases in the TOPFlash activity (Ahrens, Romereim, & Dudley, 2011; Ishitani, Matsumoto, Chitnis, & Itoh, 2005) . It has also been reported that Drosophila TCF activates gene transcription in the presence of Armadillo, the Drosophila homologue of \u03b2-catenin. However, Drosophila TCF actually functions as a repressor in the absence of Armadillo (Cavallo et al., 1998; de Lau & Clevers, 2001) . This may explain why LEF1 overexpression alone even resulted in a decrease of IAV NP protein expression and virus production (Figure 7d-f) . Furthermore, \u03b2-catenin has a transactivation domain but not LEF-1 (Vleminckx, Kemler, & Hecht, 1999) . These studies suggest that LEF1 requires \u03b2-catenin for its transcription activation activity.

There are several reported targets of miR-193b in different cells. For example, miR-193b targets ETS1 transcription factor to cause cell cycle arrest and to inhibit the invasion and migration of hepatoma cells . Upregulation of c-Kit oncogene frequently occurs in subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Overexpression of miR-193b in the Kasumi-1 acute myeloid leukaemia cell line decreases c-Kit expression and inhibits the downstream PDK1/Akt signalling pathway (Gao et al., 2011) . miR-193b also targets the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), an enzyme involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in the repression of tumour progression and invasion in human breast cancer (X. F. Li, Yan, & Shao, 2009 ).

It has been well demonstrated that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling stimulates the G1/S transition and promotes cell cycle progression and therefore proliferation through transcriptional up-regulation of target genes that encode, for example, c-Myc and cyclin D (Niehrs & Acebron, 2012) . By contrast, the \u03b2-catenin levels increase during the G1/S transition and peak during G2/M in normal and transformed epithelial cells (Olmeda, Castel, Vilaro, & Cano, 2003) . It was recently found that the mitotic CDK14/cyclin Y complex promotes Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling through phosphorylation of the LRP6 coreceptor (Davidson & Niehrs, 2010) . Cyclin D1 is a major regulator of the progression of cells into the proliferative stage of the cell cycle and is necessary for cells to enter S phase (Baldin, Lukas, Marcote, Pagano, & Draetta, 1993) . Down-regulation of cyclin D1 induces G0/G1 arrest (Masamha & Benbrook, 2009; Radu, Neubauer, Akagi, Hanafusa, & Georgescu, 2003) . We observed that cyclin D1 is markedly down-regulated in miR-193boverexpressing cells. This is likely due to the combined effect of a reduced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling activity and a direct repression by miR-193b because cyclin D1 is a well-known down-stream target of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling (Shtutman et al., 1999) , and cyclin D1 has been previously shown to be a direct target of miR-193 in cancer cells (Chen et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 376, "text": "(Niehrs & Acebron, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 513, "end": 551, "text": "(Olmeda, Castel, Vilaro, & Cano, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 697, "end": 722, "text": "(Davidson & Niehrs, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 875, "end": 924, "text": "(Baldin, Lukas, Marcote, Pagano, & Draetta, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 977, "end": 1003, "text": "(Masamha & Benbrook, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1055, "text": "Radu, Neubauer, Akagi, Hanafusa, & Georgescu, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1374, "text": "(Shtutman et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1485, "text": "(Chen et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSIONS"}, {"text": "Based on the observations that miR-193b reduced cyclin D1 protein levels and induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest, and that miR-193b and cell cycle G0/G1 arrest suppressed viral vRNP nuclear import, we speculate that miR-193b may inhibit vRNP nuclear import Harrison, Dove, Reed, and Hiscox (2007) demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus is more mobile in proliferative cells and localises to the nucleolus in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Emerging evidence supports the importance of miRNA-mediated gene regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. A number of miRNAs regulate Wnt signalling by modulating Wnt ligands, \u03b2-catenin, transcription factors, and the destruction complex. For example, miR-22, -200b, -185, -26a, -329, and -410 target Wnt ligands to inhibit the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway (G.Li et al., 2014;Shiah et al., 2014;Tang et al., 2013;Z. Wang, Humphries, Xiao, Jiang, & Yang, 2014;Zhao et al., 2014). The miR-200 cluster targets \u03b2-catenin to inhibit cancer progression (J.Liu et al., 2013;Tian et al., 2014). miR-155 negatively regulates APC in multiple carcinomas, including HCC and papillary thyroid carcinoma (X., to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we found that miR-193a/b, miR-548f-1, miR-1-1, and miR-509-1 significantly repressed Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. Excluding miR-1, which has been previously reported(Anton et al., 2011), miR-193b, miR-548f-1, and miR-509-1 are newly identified negative regulators of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. miR-1-1 and miR-133a-2 are members of a cluster family. They are encoded at two paralogous loci and are reported to down-regulate and display tumour-suppressive functions in various human cancers(Hudson et al., 2012;Kojima et al., 2012;Nasser et al., 2008). miR-509-1, previously named miR-509, inhibits cell proliferation and migration in multiple carcinomas(B.

FUNDING INFORMATION This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (Grants AI121591, HL135152, HL116876, and GM103648), the Oklahoma Center for Adult Stem Cell Research, and the Lundberg-Kienlen Endowment fund (to LL).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "). The IAV luciferase reporter vector contains a firefly luciferase under control of NP 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of influenza A/WSN/33, so it is able to respond to IAV. Luciferase reporter activity was detected after reconstitution of the IAV polymerase complex after virus infection. The reporter vector was transfected into HEK293 or A549 cells along with the miR-193b plasmid or miRcon vector. The cells were then infected with A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/ 33, OK/09 H1N1, and A/Oklahoma/309/2006 H3N2 at the indicated MOIs for 48 hr, followed by the dual luciferase assay. The viruses were chosen because A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33 are the most representative laboratory H1N1 strains, whereas OK/09 is a pandemic", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "One microgram of RNA was treated with RNase-Free DNase I (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then reverse-transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with oligo (dT)18 and random hexamer primers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Real-time PCR was carried out in a 20-\u03bcl reaction volume containing specific primers (Table 1) and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Eurogentec, Fremont, CA, USA). PCR was performed on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
