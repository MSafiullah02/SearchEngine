Thus, the problem is how best to aggregate the benefits enjoyed and the costs borne by individuals into a societal statement of value.

In the first section, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of QALYs. As a specific example, in the second section we describe a recently developed methodology called \u201cextended\u201d CEA (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility, which has been applied to some specific interventions. ECEA adds two features\u2014the element of financial risk protection (one part of insurance value assessed in the article by Garrison et al. [2]) and income distributional consequences. The third section discusses further options for expanding this approach (what we call \u201caugmented\u201d CEA [ACEA]). In the fourth section we discuss another, even broader approach called multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) that has some intuitive appeal, especially for decision makers who consider other elements or components not easily measured in CEA or CBA. This approach requires that decision makers place quantitative weights on the various criteria, depending on their relative importance for a decision. This exercise can make group decision making more transparent. The fifth section discusses budget-setting and prioritization in these frameworks, building upon the previous discussion in the article by Danzon et al. [3] discussing the situation in which budget allocations and decision-making cutoffs are not perfectly aligned. The sixth section discusses deliberative processes that represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions that is used by many HTA bodies. It uses quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but in the end, the group decision is reached by a deliberative voting process. This section also includes a brief discussion of alternative voting methods that deliberative bodies might use.",

Consider, as an example, a vaccine against or the treatment of a virulent disease such as Zika and Ebola or historical predecessors such as leprosy, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and AIDS. Public policy in these cases is often driven by issues such as public fear of contagion that are not readily captured in traditional CEA models. Such models normally do not include the entire at-risk population and their disutility from the threat of the disease. The missing element is the loss of utility associated with the potential risk of exposure to the disease\u2014the \u201cfear factor.\u201d This fear has dominated public policy toward these diseases for millennia, resulting in isolation colonies for people with leprosy, quarantine rules for tuberculosis, travel bans during severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics, and many other similar actions.

ECEA aims to describe the value of medical interventions and policies along three specific dimensions: health gains, financial risk protection, and social cost, thus extending beyond the traditional CEA measures of health gains and costs. As a further refinement (separate from gathering information about these added dimensions of value), ECEA collects this information for different subpopulations of interest, thus allowing consideration of distribution of benefits and costs (equity and fairness). Financial risk protection reflects the reduction in the risk of financial distress due to health care costs, or the financial costs of poor health. It represents a subset of the \u201cinsurance value\u201d concept discussed in the article by Lakdawalla et al. [4]. Cost is measured from the perspective of the society as a whole, as is common in CEA. One could envision including additional measures of value, but ECEA consists of these three.

Private expenditures avoided reflect the reduction in out-of-pocket spending by subgroup. Theoretically, this includes the totality of effects on private spending, including changes in non\u2013health-related spending.

Garber and Phelps [8] reference the corporate finance literature to estimate r* = \u2212r* income between 1 and 4. New work [9] using labor supply data puts the value of r* slightly below 1, and rules out values greater than 2. Variances are difficult to estimate even with large data sets in health care because of the large coefficients of skewness and kurtosis in medical expenditure data, and the requirement of having data representing expenditure distributions for people with similar or identical insurance coverage and health risks. Much can be written about each of these approaches, but the common feature is some measure of expenditures avoided, relative to the individual\u2019s willingness to bear financial burden. None of these alternatives measure perfectly the aspect of risk that is captured by variance in financial outlays and embedded in the standard risk-aversion measure.",

A second approach is to selectively, and systematically, add elements to either the numerator (net cost) or the denominator (net benefit as measured in QALYs or utility) as most appropriate. This approach has the advantage of retaining a cost-per-outcome ratio form, but is likely to affect what threshold is applicable. A third approach is to monetize all benefits so that a net monetary benefit can be calculated. Nevertheless, many health policy analysts and their clients find the step of monetizing health and related benefits objectionable. Indeed, that very objection led to the adoption of CEA over the previously developed CBA to valuing health-related investments. Net monetary benefit accomplishes the aggregation across different dimensions of value by using the same potentially objectionable step of monetizing each type of benefit. A fourth approach solves this problem by providing a way to aggregate the multiple elements of value into a single, nonmonetary metric\u2014the topic we consider next.",

In general, these approaches elicit from the \u201cdecision maker\u201d the trade-off values to incorporate issues that cannot or have not been included in CEA or CBA. Thus, these models provide a unified one-dimensional measure of value of alternative choices using a multi-attribute metric that combines the preference weights specified by the decision maker and the performance of alternative \u201ccandidates\u201d along each of the dimensions of value. Although other approaches exist, the two most common MCDA methods used in health care are the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). In the simplest form (linear MAUT), the value score is a weighted linear sum of each candidate\u2019s performance along each relevant dimension. More complex models use multiplicative models. The largest differences between these approaches appear in the processes used to elicit the decision makers\u2019 value structures.",

This approach builds upon the availability of a WTP decision cutoff in a CEA context (such as $100,000/QALY) and provides potential guidance for MCDA models that contain QALYs as an important attribute of value. In brief, this approach scales the CEA \u201ccutoff value\u201d WTP for a QALY upward to account for other dimensions of value not measured in the CEA framework. Thus, for example, if QALYs accounted for two-thirds of the weight (or value) in an MCDA model, and the WTP for a QALY CEA cutoff value was $100,000/QALY, then the MCDA value-tocost cutoff would be 3/2 times the WTP for a QALY value CEA cutoff, or (in this example) $150,000 per unit of MCDA value. In effect, agreed-upon values for a WTP for a QALY CEA cutoff (such as may exist) serve as a numeraire to estimate the total value of the expanded multicriteria value index. By analogy, it would be like adding new safety features to automobiles and then re-evaluating them taking the new features into account. The overall WTP for any automobile should expand with new safety features added, but the rankings of value would shift depending on how much new safety enhancement was built into any particular model, and each vehicle would then be ranked on the ratio of its new MCDA value to its cost.",

For these reasons, it may be valuable to deliberative bodies to incorporate an explicit framework such as MCDA.

            "text": "\nBox 1Aggregation via MCDA and Deliberative Processes: Limitations and ApproachesLimitations to Current MCDA ModelsThe methods of value elicitation in MCDA differ from model to model. Standard AHP processes ask \u201cthe decision maker\u201d to evaluate all attributes in pairwise fashion, asking (a) which is more important and then (b) on a scale of 1-9 (typically) how much more important is the better attribute. The number of questions needed to elicit the weights rises quadratically with the number of dimensions of value; for N dimensions, there are N*(N-1) questions that must be answered. In group decision-making processes, simple voting rules are normally used to elicit the \u201cgroup value\u201d structure. The problems from this approach are well known. Most importantly, this independent pairwise evaluation process admits inconsistencies in the final value structure, which must either be ignored or resolved through re-evaluation. Second, the process for converting the data to usable weights relies on mathematical methods that are difficult for most people to understand, and hence create a sort of \u201cblack box\u201d methodology. And finally, at least some forms of AHP are subject to rank reversal (the Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives issue), although some variants of AHP avoid this issue.Other approaches resolve some of these issues, but at the expense of creating other concerns. A standard approach sets boundary values for the highest and lowest levels of utility created in single dimensions and then elicits \u201cswing weights\u201d to capture relative value of each attribute, known as the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Tool using Swings ( SMARTS) [13]. This model and variants are widely used in MAUT. An easier refinement elicits the value structure by simply asking \u201cthe decision maker\u201d to list the attributes in rank order, and then creates a set of weights that give the average of all possible weights consistent with the rank order. This approach (known as SMARTER) has been shown to closely approximate the results using exact measures of value rather than these simple approximations [15]. But this process brings its own difficulties. Most importantly, this MAUT approach requires that \u201cthe decision maker\u201d specify for each attribute a lower bound (the amount of the attribute that creates zero added utility) and an upper bound (the amount of the attribute that creates maximum utility). This approach violates the standard economic concept that \u201cmore is always better\u201d by setting an upper bound on utility. More importantly, these \u201cboundary\u201d values create a metric to measure performance of each candidate on each dimension of value, typically scaled to 0-1 or 0-100, and the value weights interact with the \u201cmeasuring stick.\u201d Thus if the MAUT software\u2019s \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d metrics differ from those held in the minds of \u201cthe decision maker,\u201d the results do not represent what the decision maker intended. More detailed discussions of these issues are available [13], [16].\nBox 2The Choice of Formal Voting MethodsBoth the use of MCDA models and formal deliberative methods require that groups agree on choices. For example, AHP requires a series of N*(N-1) pairwise votes to choose the more important of each possible pair of N value dimensions, and then another vote to specify the relative importance (ranging from 1 to 9 typically). MAUT using the SMARTER process requires that the group agree on a rank-order listing of the importance of the N value dimensions [13]. Multiple voting techniques are available to accomplish these tasks, and they (not uncommonly) give different answers from the same group of voters.Formal deliberative processes also require group agreement to choose among alternatives. When three or more choices exist, no ranking method exists that meets four simple criteria [32] and all available voting methods to choose among three or more choices are subject to strategic voting manipulation [33], [34]. Even if the choices are reduced to pairwise comparisons using some structured technique as Roberts\u2019 Rules of Order, the opportunity for strategic manipulation of the outcome through agenda control looms in many settings [35]. While we have no particular recommendation about choice of voting rules, we believe that groups undertaking such votes either with MCDA models or deliberative processes should carefully consider the voting methods they adopt and understand the potential consequences for their choices. A large literature on social choice theory (too large to reference here) can help guide these choices.Deliberative processes, no matter what voting methods are used, have participants integrating a considerable amount of possibly complex information to reach a single conclusion. As is now increasingly understood in the field of behavioral economics, human decision making is often distorted by how questions are framed, by inaccurate assessment of probabilities, and by other important human fallibilities [36]. The formal structure of MCDA may avoid at least some of these issues that may persist in less structured deliberative processes.",

In a recent article, Basu and Sullivan [37] discussed the rationale of using stated preference methods for developing \u201chedonic\u201d value frameworks for health insurance products to inform the decision on whether a product should be covered or subsidized by insurance, given its price. They propose that discrete choice experiments in a nationally representative sample be used to elicit WTP for health insurance products that would cover a new health intervention with specific attributes. These elicitations should be carried out among the patients who are the direct beneficiaries of this intervention as they are diagnosed with the specific clinical condition as well as the healthy individuals who do not have that specific clinical condition but face varying risks of being diagnosed with that condition in a given year. This combination of values from both patients and nonpatients would reflect the true value of a health care intervention because it would incorporate the value of health insurance covering that intervention [38].

It is widely understood that CEA, CBA, and related models cannot deal with aggregation across individuals (equity, fairness, disparities, etc.) and, in actual practice (if not in concept), cannot incorporate some important components of value (and occasionally components of cost). Consensus-building approaches (i.e., deliberative methods) are often unstructured, idiosyncratic, and easy for individuals to influence or control through agenda manipulation, power of status, or personality. ECEA and even further expansions of such models (such as ACEA) gather information about additional outcomes beyond those considered in standard CEA, but provide no mechanism for aggregating across the relevant elements or dimensions of value. They provide uncontestable answers to questions about coverage of an intervention only when pure dominance emerges, that is, one candidate exceeds another on every possible dimension of value. Thus, these are not satisfactory methods to carry into the future without further effort to improve upon them.",

A transparent deliberative process can increase the legitimacy of decision making. Currently, such processes often lack transparency, and it is unclear what factors have been considered and how decisions were reached. Deliberative processes today are often informal and unstructured. Thus, without a standardized approach, key issues may be overlooked, decisions may be reached in an unstandardized way, and potential biases of decision makers may not be adequately explored. This can be improved, both by the introduction of cost-per-QALY evidence and by the use of more structured decision making to take account of preferences about the weight to be given to health gain\u2014for example, about disease severity, equity of access, or unmet need. A systematic comparison of the processes used by various private and public pharmacy and therapeutic committees and HTA programs may further help others determine best practices for their own setting.",

Just as the current \u201ccriterion standard\u201d of CEA did not begin in its current form, we can expect that MCDA will evolve for the better in the future. In CEA, both for lack of the proper conceptual framework and for lack of data, earlier efforts focused on things that were easily measurable. These first included \u201cdeaths averted\u201d or similar measures, and soon expanded to \u201clife-years saved\u201d or similar measures. Then came the notion of quality adjustment, leading to the current metric of the QALY based on work that relies on population-based estimates of reported quality adjustments for different health-related conditions. A similar but not identical measure\u2014DALY\u2014is used by the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and others: for this measure, expert judgment has been used (at least initially) rather than population survey data to create the adjustment factors [17], although DALY estimates increasingly turn to population-based metrics when available. A third related measure is the capabilities-adjusted life-year, using a capabilities index instead of a health state utility, initially proposed by Amartya Sen, progressed by Nussbaum [39], and operationalized by Anand et al. [40].",

Little is known about important human factor issues associated with the use of various MCDA models, including ease of use, susceptibility to strategic manipulation, and ease of comprehension of the methods (and hence acceptance of the results).
