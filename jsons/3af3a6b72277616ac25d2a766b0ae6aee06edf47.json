My experience was that people individually responded with great acuity and often forced their agencies and bureaucracies to also respond and actually fulfill their missions. Here, I will just mention some of the changes that were made for communication and publication. At least some journals, such as The New England Journal of Medicine, made all their ebola-related articles open access. Some open access PLoS journals shifted fast publication to their associated (but refereed) blogs, but by Spring 2015 were able to publish new reports fairly quickly. In the meantime many researchers shared data without regard to priority of publication. The social scientists set up something like a temporary fast-publication journal, the Ebola Anthropology Platform in the UK, which played a major role in providing a place for well-researched reports that needed to be put out quickly.",

Unfortunately, none of them were actually ready to be used. It may be that a certain lassitude and comfort level had set in, over a decade after the anthrax attacks in 2001. There is a kind of public biowarfare defense community, so to speak, with their own conferences and journals and associated laboratories and companies. Federal research funding in the United States, in general, includes various small business requirements, and these also apply to funds for biowarfare defense. Such funding can be a useful steady source of income for smaller (or boutique) bioresearch companies. Canada, under the Harper governments, had reached a peak of Thatcher-influenced research policy that required commercial investment, or buyin, for many areas of public research in the Canadian government laboratories, or their projects would be ended. My guess is that this policy helped lead to the rights to one of the two leading ebola vaccine candidates going from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in WInnipeg to NewLink Genetics of the United States for what I recall as two hundred thousand dollars, Canadian. This was rVSV-EBOV, the vaccine that ultimately was used in Ebola \u00c7a Suffit! (by then produced by Merck).",

One alternative approach is to first silence key genes in a dangerous virus, so it can replicate but not cause damage, and then use it as a vehicle for recombinant antigen expression.

They were not only sponging and changing me, they also were constantly laundering all the bed sheets and clothes I was soiling, until I was 'med-evacuated' the indigenous way: the Paramount Chief sent his ceremonial hammock with 4 hammock bearers (who worked in pairs, running at a regular jog up and down hills to keep the momentum, and relieving each other at regular intervals), and I was out of there in no time at all, and on a main road where they flagged down a passing vehicle\".",

Even with my ready cash to pay for transportation it took me and the man delegated by the village elders to accompany me about 12 h to get to the Serabu hospital emergency ward, which gives you some sense of how unrealistic it may be to expect isolated rural folks who may not have the means to pay for double transportation all the way there to get to hospitals (in my case, 4 different vehicles/legs to the journey, in addition to the bit with the hammock).\" We will return to the hammock bearers later. Some of the social scientists saw very early that people were condemned for not bringing ebola patients to medical isolation, even when transportation was impossible and medical centers were nonfunctional. I read medical team reports from all three countries that also recognized the failures in each stage of transportation, facilities, adequate material supplies and successful clinical care that were supposed to make clinical-isolation work. Medical messaging castigated the most basic human need to care for loved ones, rather than providing assistance with material and guides for home or local health care of ebola. It was isolation that was needed, whether the setting was a medical facility, community, social group or at home; not just medical isolation, even when it was unobtainable.",

Many farms had isolated field shelters used at harvest which could have been used. This was similar to social practices used for containing smallpox in Zaire (now DRC) that were repurposed during the first ebola outbreak in 1976. Similar practices had been used historically for other epidemics in West Africa as well. Basic palliative care at home had to be done in a clinical manner, to give caregivers a chance at survival. But these were homes without running water, power, and in significant numbers not even two plastic buckets for water or bleach solution. People could contain the epidemic and break chains of transmission (epidemic intervention) by isolation (patient) and semi-isolation (caregiver) without outside aid. But without that aid, both caregiver and patient would probably have died. With improved communication about burial, at least they could have been buried safely (burial teams or local burial teams) with socially adjusted medical burial.",

Don't eat bushmeat along with other more useful messages. Often the surveys were seen as part of the government. When engaged by longer-form more open-ended investigations and asked, for example what they would actually do in response to ebola the answers could be quite different. Medical work in foreign-supported centralized hospitals could involve gruesome triage decisions and 70% death rates in 2014. There were two waves of the international response trying to bring isolation and health-care closer to people: first in what were called Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) which were relatively more advanced, and then in what were called Community Care Centers (CCCs).

However, sexual transmission of ebola developed harder and more convincing evidence. Ebola survival in semen turned out to vary widely and could go on for an indeterminate time in some patients. Gradually it became clear that there were multiple kinds of immuneprotected tissues where the virus could remain, be detected, and sometimes be culturable (Vetter et al. 2016) . Although sex, usually semen, was the main cause of secondary infections, infection of other tissues could cause long-term problems, for example in eyes. Sex was a real but relatively rare means of transmission compared to, say, Zika. Nor was being ebola-free (by blood testing) the end of long-term physical and mental consequences for patients (Etard et al. 2017) .",

We received one of these rarer atypical case description from a colleague, Lina Moses working in Kenema, Sierra Leone, at the height of the epidemic. She is Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Global Community Health and Behavioral Sciences, Tulane University (Moses 2014) : \" [\u2026] In the three and a half months doing this Ebola response, I was very surprised to see several cases of what I thought was mild disease. One case in particular, the contact of a case that died with severe hemorrhaging, vomiting, diarrhea, had a fever one day, came in for testing and was positive with low viral load. By the time we got the results he was feeling better, but we had to admit him because he had detectable virus. He was not too happy about this as he never developed any further symptoms. In fact, he occupied his time with push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups and was considerably bigger when he was discharged four days after admission.

There were only small, brief, outbreaks in Nigeria, Senegal and Mali, for example. Sometimes this was by a combination of preparation, skill and good fortune. Urban Nigeria could have been the beginning of a world-wide epidemic (Shuaib et al. 2014) . Sometimes, as in Guinea-Bissau, which seemed to have escaped transmission, success may have been due mainly to luck. The international response teams of the Centers for DIsease Control, coordinating with national health systems, had a major role. Jeremy Farrar and Peter Piot described the vastly expanded scope of engagement needed for an ebola epidemic, when classical outbreak control is no longer sufficient (Farrar and Piot 2014) . As the epidemic expanded exponentially, throughout 2014, clinical isolation was still the main model for epidemic control; ignoring conditions of unsafe or non-existent transportation to inadequately staffed and supplied facilities, with high mortality rates. MSF, whose capacity had been over-run, for first time in its history called for military intervention and assistance, but with the same model for epidemic control. There has been a recurrent amnesia about key social lessons learned about both clinical and epidemiological engagement during ebola outbreaks. The lessons forgotten include the social design of care facilities and community isolation and treatment, among many others (Bremen and Johnson 2014; Bremen et al. 2016; Hewlett and Hewlett 2007; Hewlett 2016) . The lessons are learned and then forgotten, repeatedly since 1976. This is a bureaucratic and institutional mystery (Abramowitz et al. 2015) . On the other hand, some key lessons learned, or imagined to have been learned, from the much smaller ebola outbreaks in central Africa were remembered all too well, where they did not apply. For example, messaging on bats, in particular, and bushmeat in general (Frieden et al. 2014) were contradicted by what people saw. Hunters and their families were not dying in West Africa; clinic and hospital staff were. In a factually human-human transmission epidemic, this damaged the credibility of international actors and of health program messaging.",

Richards describes the case for how rapid community learning and social adaptation on ebola was a major cause for the turning of the epicurve and for control of the epidemic. These changes appear to be mainly what I call epidemic measures, that limit or end transmission, as opposed to clinical care. His own specific examples come from villages studied in depth in 2014 and 2015 by the team he works with at Njala University in Sierra Leone, including Esther Yei Mokuwa. A large number were in Jawei chiefdom, the hardest hit chiefdom of Kailahun District, the epicenter of the epidemic. In general, he thinks that across Sierra Leone, areas that were hit first and hardest put the greatest adaptive measures in place. How rapid learning was adapted in urban and periurban areas, will have to be set aside.",

Dialog can lead to cross-cultural convergence. People have a remarkable capacity to maintain prior judgements in the face of compelling empirical evidence. Here, I have been more interested in showing how this warped the international medical response. More broadly applied, cross-cultural convergence can lead to remarkably interesting and enriched kinds of science. Most of the examples I know of come from crosscultural agriculture, so to speak.",
