            "text": "Clinical signs and pathology: Diseased individuals first show edema in their peristomes, the tentacles cannot retract completely and adhesion capacities are weakened. This latter ailment results in diseased individuals dropping to the bottom of the ponds. Grazing rate and activity decrease and upwards of 80% eviscerate (i.e. eject their internal organs). About 2\u20133 days later, small white lesions usually appear on the surface of the skin and gradually expand, and increased mucus secretion is often noticed over large areas of the body wall. About 5\u20136 days after occurrence of the first symptoms the sea cucumbers die, with mortality often in excess of 90% (Wang et al., 2005a). Virus-like particles (VLPs) have been found associated within the epithelium of the intestine of diseased individuals (Wang et al., 2007). Transmission electron microscopic examinations showed that the virions are spherical, 80\u2013100 nm in diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. Detailed studies on the morphogenesis of these viruses found many characteristics previously described for other coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2007). Virus particles were found to be congregated, and always formed a virus vesicle with an encircling membrane (Wang et al., 2007). The most obvious cellular pathologic feature appears to be large granular areas of cytoplasm, relatively devoid of organelles. Tubular structures within virus-containing vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and double-membrane vesicles are also routinely found in the cytopathic cells. Furthermore, in support of a viral pathogen being the causal agent for this disease, no rickettsia, chlamydia, bacteria, or other parasitic organisms have been seen to be associated with any of the diseased tissues sampled (Wang et al., 2007). Furthermore, these VLPs are only present in diseased individuals and absent in healthy animals. However, no infection trials have been conducted to date. Therefore, further evidence is required to prove that these VLPs are the aetiological agent. Interestingly, the same VLPs have also been observed in diseased larvae (30 days old). This latter finding suggests that the disease may be transmitted vertically from parents, which may have severe implications for transportation of brood stock from pond to pond.",

Commonly members of the genus Vibrio are isolated from diseased lesions, including Vibrio cyclitrophicus, Vibrio splendidus, Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio tasmaniensis, Vibrio tapetis, and Vibrio alginolyticus (Deng et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2015). However others such as a Photobacterium sp. (Deng et al., 2008, Deng et al., 2009), Pseudomonas nigrifacien (Deng et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2005aa), Aeromonas salmonda and Aeromonas media (Wang et al., 2007), a Pseudoalteromonas sp. and Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis (Liu et al., 2010) and a Marinomonoas dokdonensi (Deng et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2006) have also been implicated to play some role. The latter pathological agent, has been described under one of the alternative names associated with disease, APT (Deng et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2006). Inoculation experiments have been fulfilled for a few of these candidate pathogens including the Pseudoalteromonas sp., P. tetraodonis (Liu et al., 2010) and V. splendidus (Lu et al., 2015), suggesting that at the very least these three play a significant role in the disease aetiology. Furthermore, phage therapy has been used to treat this disease targeting V. alginolyticus (Zhang et al., 2015) again suggesting a role for this bacterium.",

            "text": "In addition, like many marine diseases, researchers are only recently searching for viruses associated with these diseases. Indeed, two distinct virus like particles have now been observed associated with the disease lesions (Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2007). These include, a spherical virus with a diameter of 80\u2013100 nm and a spherical virus with a nucleocapsid and diameter of 120\u2013250 nm (Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2007). The latter of the two has been named, skin ulceration and peristome tumescence syndrome virus (SUPTSV) (Liu et al., 2010). Crude experimental inoculation trials, which included the addition of filtered tissue extracts (i.e. supposedly only containing viruses) to otherwise healthy individuals elicited similar disease signs, suggesting that the proposed virus does indeed play an important role in disease onset. Interestingly, the disease signs produced from the bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, although resulting in the same overall pathology had certain differences. For example, inoculation with the bacterial pathogens included ulcer spots on the dorsal skin and abdominal parapodia, followed by an increase in the number and merging of ulcer spots and a decrease or loss of tentacle activity. In comparison symptoms caused by inoculation of the viral pathogen included an initial decrease in tentacle activity or loss of activity all together, peristome tumescence and the decay of dorsal papillate podia and peristome, along with abdominal ulceration. These differences suggest that the virus first affects the function of cells in tentacles and peristome, whereas bacteria initially cause ulceration of the skin. Finally, its worthy of note here that unidentified platyhelminths are often observed in diseased tissue and they are thought to cause heavy damage to the skin. The size of the worms is variable, normally ranging from 50 to 130 mm. Histological observations demonstrate that there is an abundance of worms in the tissues of the lesion area. They occupy a large space within the tissues and cause topical necrosis and scattering of the musculature (Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2007). However, exactly how these worms fit into the overall pathology of this disease remains unknown.",

However there are slight differences in the way the disease often manifests itself, suggesting that there may actually be multiple diseases currently under this one banner. For example in Australia and Madagascar, white lesions are observed to appear near the cloacal orifice and extends over the whole body, whilst in China, the white lesions have been noted to occur on any part of the body, begin canking and then extend over the whole body surface (Mercier et al., 2005, Yin-Geng et al., 2005). This disease usually results in chronic mortalities, with cumulative rates reported of 30\u201350%. Generally, infected individuals die within 3\u201315 days of the first clinical signs being observed. Skin ulceration begins with the appearance of small white patches (ca. 1 mm in diameter), which enlarge and eventually expose the underlying muscle and spicules. Yet, the mesothelium, the muscles and the internal organs remain unaffected. Podia inside lesions are often totally destroyed. Juveniles have been reported to show less motivation once they had contracted the disease and become translucent (Mercier et al., 2005, Yin-Geng et al., 2005). Scanning electron micrographs show two distinct \u2018zones\u2019 associated with this disease. The first, where the epidermis and cuticle are totally destroyed and where disorganized connective tissue is exposed has been refered to as the \u2018affective zone\u2019 and appears to be colonised by numerous different types of microorganisms. The second \u2018zone\u2019 is the borderline area of infestation, a few tens of micrometres wide where the surface is again colonised by a mix of microorganisms and where patches of degrading epidermis are mixed with degrading, exposed connective tissue. In the \u2018affected zone\u2019, collagen fibres run in all directions, breaking off from each other and ossicles, some of which appear highly degraded, are exposed to the external medium.",

            "text": "Clinical signs and pathology: First identified in 2004, viscera rejection syndrome (VRS) usually starts with only a few infected individuals at the bottom of ponds, but the disease often spreads quickly. After 2\u20133 days, the viscera are ejected out of the body and the sea cucumbers succumb shortly afterwards. More than 50% of hatcheries have been known to exhibit this disease, with more than 90% mortality in some areas. Previously VRS was characterised in the same disease group as SUD (see above), however Deng et al. (2009) argued that due to substantial differences in pathology, these diseases should be classed as separate diseases/syndromes. There are four main reasons which led Deng and colleagues to suggest a separation of these diseases. Primarily, sea cucumbers suffering from SUD rarely exhibit signs of viscera ejection but do exhibit peristome edema expanding to the whole body. A second reason for this proposed separation of diseases is that after dissection of infected individuals the majority of those with SUD (over 90%) had satiation intestines in coelom. In comparison, those with VRS (again upwards of 90% of infected individuals) had no intestines within their coeloms. Furthermore, both diseases show differences in their mortality rates and have different methods proposed for prevention. SUD for example has been shown to be treatable with antibiotics (slowing the spread), with mortality usually around 50%. In contrast VRS shows high infectivity, rapid spread, little response to antibiotic treatment and usually 80\u2013100% mortality. Finally, although no definitive causal agents have been proposed for either disease state, the general consensus over the causal agents seems to differ between diseases.",

To date, more than 98 species of arthropods have been reported as hosts or carriers of WSSV, either from culture facilities, the wild or experimental infection (S\u00e1nchez-Paz, 2010). From the 98 susceptible species, Stentiford et al. (2009) identified 67 which were eligible to be described as susceptible using the European Food Standard Agency (EFSA) principles. However, although all these species are susceptible, they have recently been found to vary in their levels of susceptibility (Bateman et al., 2012a). Research is also concentrating on potential vectors of this disease, which may be facilitating the spread. Numerous aquatic organisms such as rotifers (Yan et al., 2004), bivalves, polychaete worms (Vijayan et al., 2005), non-decapod crustaceans such as Artemia sp. and copepods have all been reported as potential vectors (Stentiford et al., 2009). Although, the viruses have been shown to accumulate in these vectors in large viable numbers, there has been no evidence of replication within these hosts meaning they are currently classed as only being \u2018mechanical\u2019 vectors (Chang et al., 2002, Lo et al., 1996, Yan et al., 2004).",

Virions measure 120\u2013150 nm in diameter and 270\u2013290 nm in length and in some cases a tail like projection can be seen extending from one end.

Due to this rapid spread, and the isolation and identification by numerous independent laboratories, the virus was referred to by a variety of different names; however it was agreed that these infections are actually all caused by the same agent and the name White Spot Syndrome Virus was adopted (Joseph et al. 2015). WSD is listed as an OIE notifiable disease and as a non-exotic disease within Europe, EC Council Directive 2006/88/EC. Although not officially reported (i.e. in scientific publications), outbreaks of WSD have been observed in shrimp farms in Southern Europe, and these reports provided the basis that WSD should be classified as a non-exotic disease to Europe. However, the prevalence and spread of this virus throughout Europe remain unclear; with the last known/reported outbreak of the disease being in 2001 on a shrimp farm in Italy (Stentiford and Lightner, 2011).",

Unsurprisingly, the shrimp in the supermarkets harboured viable viral particles which where transmissible to live penaeid shrimp. Furthermore, WSSV was also successfully transmitted to Homarus gammarus, which were fed on these infected supermarket-derived shrimp, suggesting a possible pathway for WSSV to infect other species such as lobsters and highlighting a pathway for this disease to infect European crustacean stocks in the future (Bateman et al., 2012a). Finally, anecdotal evidence also suggests that some anglers are using commodity product as bait. As commodity product is not covered or controlled by existing legislation, we suggest that this practice needs to be investigated and regulated, as there is the potential for spread of pathogens such as WSSV in this way.",

Certain species of birds and the water-boatmen, Trichocorixa reticulata have been proposed as possible mechanical vectors (Brock, 1997) which are capable or transporting the disease from pond to pond, therefore making control of this disease very difficult.

A similar phenomenon occurs in the human disease cholera, where a phage makes the Vibrio cholerae bacterium capable of producing a toxin that causes cholera's life-threatening diarrhoea. To date, it remains unclear as to whether or not all incidences of EMS/AHPND are caused by one or more strains of V. parahaemolyticus.

(2014) suggests that this practice may do more harm than good. Upon restocking, the increase in nutrient availability, decreased microbial community and consequent lack of competition may favour fast growing bacteria, such is the case with the genus Vibrio. The authors go on to suggest that microbial management practices may be the best solution to control this disease (De Schryver et al., 2014). The development of diagnostic tests for rapid detection of the EMS/AHPNS pathogen is ongoing, which will enable improved management of hatcheries and ponds, and help lead to a long-term solution for this disease. This will also enable a better evaluation of risks associated with importation of frozen shrimp or other products from countries affected by EMS/AHPND. In fact, some countries have already implemented policies that restrict the importation of frozen shrimp or other products from EMS/AHPND-affected countries. However, research currently indicates that EMS/AHPND does not survive cooking or freezing, and repeated attempts to transmit the disease using frozen tissue have so far been unsuccessful (Lightner et al., 2012). Therefore, frozen shrimp are likely to pose a low risk for contamination of wild shrimp or the environment because EMS/AHPND-infected shrimp are typically very small and do not enter international commerce, so although this disease is damaging and worthy of note in this review, the potential for spread to other countries should be relatively limited.",

Similar to many diseases in this group, it has been particularly well studied due to the disease impacting on stocks of such a commercially viable species. Although, predominantly associated with H. americanus, the pathogen has been recorded in low prevalence in other crustacean species in the wild such as Libinia emarginata, Carcinus maenas, Cancer borealis, Cancer irroratus and Penaeus aztecus (Alderman, 1996). Furthermore, experimentally, the disease has been transferable to Panulirus interruptus, Pandalus platyceros, Cancer irroratus, Cancer magister, Geryon quinquedens, Chionoecetes opilio and Callinectes sapidus (Alderman, 1996). The diverse number of species this pathogen has been associated with clearly shows the dramatic influence epidemics of this disease can have on the crustacean populations and the whole ecosystem in general. Enzootics in both wild populations and captive animals are relatively common off the American/Canadian coast line and reports have occurred in cultured lobsters in California, however prevalence was reportedly low (Stewart, 1975). Despite the high number of species which have been shown to be susceptible to this disease, the pathogen had not been reported to be present in European waters until relatively recently. In 2011, the press reported the capture of an American lobster off the coast of Devon, Southern UK (Stebbing et al., 2012a). The lobster caught, had blue bands around its claws, indicative of being caught and tossed overboard by a passing ship. This lobster tested positive for Gaffkaemia and this spread real concern of the possibility that European lobsters H. gammarus, could have been exposed to this devastating disease. Since this first report, and a further positive outbreak in a European lobster holding facility in South Wales, a base line survey was conducted to test the presence or absence of the disease in wild populations of H. gammarus around the east coast of England and Wales (Stebbing et al., 2012b). Results showed that although Gaffkaemia was detected in wild populations, its prevalence was low (positive in < 1% of those tested). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis conducted on the strains of A. viridians var. homari collected from the UK wild lobsters, those in the Welsh holding facility and examples from the USA and Canada showed that the isolates were identical, supporting the theory that this pathogen has been introduced into the UK, likely with the release of American lobsters, H. americanus. Although the increase in H. americanus in UK waters is of great concern and has the potential to cause a pandemic of Gaffkaemia, there are reports that there was a previous outbreak in England in the 1960s, although this is difficult to confirm (Stebbing et al., 2012b). To date, however no other European crustaceans have been tested for the presence of this pathogen and future studies should focus on assessing the extent of the problem in European waters.",

Although the disease has subsided, to a degree, ESD prevalence remains relatively high but varies temporally and geographically between 10 and 40% (Castro and Somers, 2012). Similarly to Gaffkaemia, ESD has also recently been reported in H. gammarus populations off the coast of Norway and within public aquaria. Although little research has been conducted on these European diseased lobsters, it is hypothesised that the pathogen (again similar to that for Gaffkaemia) has been transported over with their American cousins (J\u00f8rstad et al., 2011) and there is a very high potential that a similar epidemic (to that recorded in the East Atlantic) could occur in European waters.",

Since the initial discovery in E. sinensis, other spiroplasma-caused diseases have been identified in freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, (Wang et al., 2005b) and in shrimp such as the white Pacific shrimp, P. vannamei (Nunan et al., 2004) and Rimicaris exoculata (Zbinden and Cambon-Bonavita, 2003), highlighting the likelihood of more cases being confirmed in the coming years.

The fact that the parasite is only observed in juvenile life stages may indicate that the parasite is causing mortality within these infected crabs, hence removing them from the population.

Mikrocytid specific primers have now been utilised to screen invertebrate tissues and environmental DNA (eDNA) samples from marine, freshwater and soil environments from the UK, continental Europe, South Africa, Panama and Borneo. To date, P. canceri has not been detected in any of the environmental samples, however it was detected in a range of shoreline invertebrates, demonstrating that these newly recognised parasites are common, diverse and widespread.

Specifically, devastating impacts have been recorded for numerous crab populations worldwide (Small, 2012), as infections are more often than not fatal. There have been various disease names associated with this parasite, which is due to the various characteristics of the disease in each species. These include: bitter crab disease (in Chionoecetes spp.) (Meyers et al., 1987), pink crab disease (in Cancer pagurus) (Stentiford et al., 2002), milky disease (in Portunus trituberculatus, Scylla serrata) (Eddy et al., 2007, Li et al., 2008bb), yellow water disease (in S. serrata) (Xu et al., 2007) and milky shrimp disease (in Exopalaemon carinicauda) (Xu et al., 2010). This condition causes massive losses to wild crustacean populations and associated fisheries (Small, 2012) and has recently been associated with losses in cultured crabs and shrimp in China, with losses of up to 100% having been reported in these farms. The now increasingly common practice of rearing several different species in the same pond (known as polyculture) is likely a significant contributing factor towards transmission of the parasite between species and the occurrence of Hematodinium infections within E. carinicauda has obvious implications for the culture of other economically important shrimp species (Small, 2012). Following the emergence of Hematodinium in aquaculture in China (Xu et al., 2007, Xu et al., 2010, Li et al., 2008b), Small (2012) proposed that Hematodinium meets the criteria for listing as an emerging aquatic animal disease and suggested that the listing of this disease should be considered by the OIE.",

As is becoming a common theme throughout this review, prevalence of this disease has been associated with increases in average sea surface temperatures and overcrowding (Sauvage et al., 2009). To date, this condition has been recorded throughout much of Europe and especially in France and around Ireland. Mortality associated with OsHV-1 is primarily observed among oysters less than one year of age, although all ages of oysters have been recorded as contracting the disease at some point. A harmonised approach has also now been implemented between EU member states with regard to managing and mitigating the spread of this disease, particularly focusing at trying to keep the virus from UK waters (Murray et al., 2012), which at the time of writing show only a few isolated cases of infection (Murray et al., 2012). Given the economic importance of oyster aquaculture in many European countries, the EU Commission Regulation n. 175/2010 was enacted in March 2010 to identify the presence of OsHV-1 \u03bcvar associated with mortality in oysters in order to reduce the spread of the virus to uninfected regions. According to the regulation, disease control measures must be implemented which include the establishment of containment areas and the restriction of movement from these areas if OsHV-1 \u03bcvar and accompanying mortality is identified.

Furthermore, isolated cultures of V. aestuarianus have been shown to induce similar disease pathologies in inoculation trials under controlled laboratory conditions. Alarmingly, prevalence of this pathogen in certain populations appears to be increasing. In 2012 for example, V. aestuarianus was detected in 100% of moribund adults tested, whereas only a few individuals tested positive in 2009 and 2010 (Wendling et al., 2014). Interestingly, all oysters which tested positive in 2012 had isolates which matched those from French oysters (Wendling et al., 2014). Furthermore the virulence of specific isolates also appears to be increasing, with this particular French isolate being particularly pathogenic (Wendling et al., 2014). Similarly, isolates of V. aestuarianus from infected oysters in Ireland have shown to induce very high mortalities of otherwise healthy C. gigas within only a few days of inoculation. However, despite this apparent increase in virulence, there is no evidence to suggest that new strains are responsible for the current outbreaks and future research should focus on assessing the environmental conditions that could potentially favour this apparent increase in virulence.",

In the latter instances, Marteilia have been shown to be transmitted from infected oysters and infected mussels to healthy copepods. Mature sporangia of M. refringens have recently been observed in spring and autumn in mussels suggestive that the parasite has two cycles per year and that the mussels release the parasites from spring to autumn. In conjunction, M. refringens has also been detected in P. grani copepodid stages between June and November strengthening the hypothesis of the transmission of the parasites from copepods to mussels. In addition, in-situ end labelling showed that the Marteilia were present within the digestive tracts and gonads of the 3rd copepodid stages (Arzul et al., 2014).

For an in-depth review on this disease we refer you to Berthe et al. (2004). Severe infections often cause loss of condition as a consequence of reduced energy acquisition. The parasite may also interfere directly with the host feeding and absorption simply by its physical presence. Death is usually attributed to direct blockage of the digestive gland by the parasite and consequent host starvation. Mature spores of Marteilia spp. are released into the environment via the lumen of the digestive tubules and intestine. This release is associated with destruction of the host digestive gland epithelia with cases observed whereby the secondary digestive tubules have been totally destroyed by the release of the spores. The parasite evolves from early stages, usually observed in the epithelia of the upper digestive tract, such as the palps and stomach. In some rare cases they have been observed to develop in the gills. Sporulation takes place within the epithelium of the digestive gland tubules. Sporangia are released in the lumen of the digestive tract and this is when the destruction of the digestive gland epithelia usually occurs.",

However outbreaks can be reduced by culturing oysters in waters with salinity below 12 to 15 ppt (Cook et al., 1998). In the wild, season salinities, around 12 ppt, appear favorable for supporting full dermo disease outbreaks, so in theory areas most at risk from these disease outbreaks can be identified by local salinity patterns (Cook et al., 1998). Perkinsus proliferates at temperatures higher than 20 \u00b0C and in warm, southern waters \u2018dermo\u2019 has been recorded as decimating up to 50% of oyster beds each year (Cook et al., 1998). The parasites are transmitted directly between individual oysters, primarily when the oysters are in advanced stages of infection, die and then disintegrate. New infections are acquired as oysters feed, the parasite infecting its hosts through the gut epithelia. Interestingly, it has been reported that most serious outbreaks occur during drought years, so as climate change is predicted to increase periods of draught in many areas of the globe, increases in this disease may also likely occur. Areas such as in the gulf of Mexico are also likely to see increases in this disease, as dermo has been linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Cook et al., 1998), with serious outbreaks regularly following the arrival of warm, dry, La Nina climatic conditions.",

We are, however, beginning to understand how certain species may play specific roles. For example, B. ostreae appears to mainly infect the haemocytes of infected oysters and transmission appears to be direct from infected to na\u00efve oysters. The parasites enter through epithelia from palleal organs including the gills. Once they have passed the epithelium barrier, they are internalized within haemocytes which in turn contribute to the spread of the parasite in all the other organs. Multiplication of B. ostreae occurs inside the haemocytes and is associated with a decrease of esterases and production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the modulation of apopotosis and decrease of phagocytosis has also been proposed as being important mechanisms related to resistance to these parasites (Engelsma et al., 2014). B. ostreae, affects the granular blood cells (haemocytes) of the host. Lesions occur in the connective tissue of the gills, mantle and digestive gland. The parasite multiplies by binary fission. Ten or more parasites have been observed within an infected haemocyte. More rarely, during the terminal stages of the disease, a larger plasmodial form can occur, this contains between 3 and 5 nuclei.",

In fact the causative agent was initially suspected to be that of M. mackini due to the similarities in gross pathology to that of Denman Island Disease. Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were shown to suffer mortality events with upwards of 20% of animals reportedly being lost. Infected individuals were seen to be gaping and were thin and watery, with green pustules observed on the adductor muscle and on the surface of the mantle tissue. Furthermore, histology revealed the presence of microcell parasites throughout the cytoplasm of vesicular connective tissues and within the fibres of the adductor muscle. However, diagnostic tests for M. mackini came back negative and sequencing revealed that it was only 79% similar to M. mackini. Hartikainen et al. (2014) was the first to describe this recent outbreak and highlighted that it is the first time that a Mikrocytos infection has been described infecting Pacific oysters in Europe. This recent discovery therefore represents a new potential threat to the molluscan industries throughout Europe.",

We highlight a dramatic skew in the knowledge available between different phyla, particularly associated with the level of importance these groups are given based on their importance in aquaculture and as a sustainable food source. Specifically, species in the sub phylum Crustacea and the phylum Mollusca are extensively studied in contrast to Holothuroidea, although there remains a large amount of unknowns with regard to specific diseases and parasites/pathogens even in these two groups. Interestingly, especially with regard to mariculture, researchers appear to be well advanced with regard to viral work for both Crustacea and Mollusca. Even with regard to bacterial induced diseases, the discovery of how phages interact with the proposed pathogens, highlights the importance viruses play not just in disease but also with regard to healthy systems. Finally, and more importantly, this review highlights the very real risk of the continued spread of specific pathogens around the globe. This is likely to occur either via the introduction of the hosts (during set up of different aquaculture practices for example) or alternatively via the transmission of the pathogens themselves (by transport in the ballast waters of ships or through the aquarium trade). Despite the well documented cases of disease spread, it is surprising that we appear to not be able to learn from these past mistakes and are continuing the transport diseased individuals or vectors around the globe. Specifically a call for more control appears to be needed, implemented in the movement of live individuals and also frozen food to attempt to seriously minimize further spread of novel pathogens and those already described.",

Therefore, we can only suggest that the best strategy to minimize stocks contracting disease at the current time should be robust management. For example, broodstocks used for reproduction should be healthy without any signs of pathogens which will avoid vertical infections occurring. Stocking density should be adapted to the environmental conditions, culture method and experience \u2014 overcrowded conditions would lower resistance to diseases. Individuals should be fed with high quality diets that are supplemented with necessary elements including vitamins and minerals. Water quality should be maintained by keeping an optimum stocking density, avoiding over feeding and increasing water exchange rates whilst monitoring the water quality on a daily basis. All equipment and tools should be disinfected before use or before transfer from one tank to another and excess food, faeces and other organic wastes should be siphoned and removed as quickly as possible. Finally, if a disease is detected, actions and effective measures should be taken and moribund individuals should be removed from the tanks and be properly disposed. As a last resort antibiotics should only be used when the causative pathogen(s) have been confirmed (see above for which diseases this relates to). Although the above will assist in reducing disease spread in mariculture, they do not relate to spread in wild populations, yet any improvements which can occur in aquaculture husbandry may reduce the risk to wild populations and limit the spread into these environments as well.",
