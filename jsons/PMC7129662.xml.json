Therefore, a validated and rapid diagnostic assay is of great importance. Current laboratory criteria for ensuring a confirmed diagnosis of LD involve isolating Legionellae by culture and detecting L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine or seroconversion. Although these methodologies have good specificity, they primarily detect L. pneumophila. Non-pneumophila Legionella spp. may grow on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) media, but it usually takes approximately 1\u20132 weeks of incubation time for identification. Some strains, such as Legionella-like amoebal pathogens, are very fastidious and require amoebal co-culture [7], which is laborious and impractical for clinical diagnosis. Therefore, infections caused by non-pneumophila species may not be diagnosed.",

For example, the proportion of cases diagnosed by PCR and other genotypic methods in Europe from 1995 to 2004 accounts for < 2% of cases of LD (n = 27 244) [8]. Reluctance to use PCR assays for diagnosis is partially attributable to: (i) postamplification procedures that are laborious, time-consuming and prone to carry-over contamination and false positivity, and (ii) limited assay optimization and validation. Here, we present a real-time PCR assay that allows rapid detection and differentiation of L. pneumophila from 50 non-pneumophila species without the need for post-PCR manipulation. The assay has been optimized to ensure sensitivity and specificity and validation has been carried out using culture isolates and clinical specimens. This assay should increase the rate of detection of infection caused by non-pneumophila strains of Legionellae and contribute to early diagnosis of LD.",

Extensive use of the UA test has resulted in a decrease in the use of other diagnostic methods, thus reducing the frequency of identification of species other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1 [11]. For example, a recent study of population-based surveillance of severe pneumonia in Thailand found no cases of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 infection using a UA test, but serological evidence suggested that approximately 5% of cases of pneumonia may be caused by L. longbeachae (n = 397) [12]. This underscores the need for diagnostic tests for all Legionella spp. In this study, we developed and validated a 23S-5S dual-colour real-time PCR assay. The LLOD of the assay was 3 gEq/reaction for genomic DNA or 7.5 CFU/mL for the live Legionella strain. It can distinguish L. pneumophila from nonpneumophila Legionella spp. and can detect Legionella spp. from all culture-positive clinical specimens within 3 h without requiring post-PCR processing steps. We assessed the specificity of the assay by analysing the DNA sequence of the amplicon or the mip gene and by assessing the reactivity with the non-Legionella bacteria and viruses.",

In recent years, molecular methods based on nucleic acid testing (NAT) have been extensively explored for diagnosis of LD. Overall NAT can be assigned to four types of assay: (i) PCR amplification of the whole genome followed by restriction enzymatic digestion and gel analysis [13, 14]; (ii) PCR amplification of specific regions of the genome followed by sequencing analysis [15, 16]; (iii) DNA hybridization or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [17, 18, 19], and (iv) real-time PCR assays targeting 16S rRNA, the mip gene or the 23S-5S intergenetic region [20, 21, 22, 23]. A high rate of recombination in the 16S rRNA gene results in multiple heterogeneous copies in the genome, which may lead to erroneous species identification [24, 25]. The Legionella mip gene is highly variable, which makes designing a consensus probe to recognize all Legionella spp. virtually impossible [9]. The relatively conserved 23S-5S region allows the selection of primers and probes to detect L. pneumophila and Legionella spp. in a singleplex format. Three singleplex real-time PCR assays for identifying and differentiating L. pneumophila from other Legionella spp. have been reported [20, 21, 22]. These tests either require sequencing or melting curve analysis to distinguish L. pneumophila from other species, or lack specificity or validation using clinical specimens [20, 21, 22].",

Oral pharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal swabs that are routinely taken from patients with respiratory infections may be less than ideal for Legionella- specific PCR testing unless the burden of Legionellae is high [26]. Collection of serum or urine samples is simple to perform, but the reported sensitivity varies from 30% to 86% for urine samples [27, 28, 29] and is < 60% for serum samples from patients with proven LD [30]. It appears that Legionella DNA in serum only peaks in the acute stage of infection [30]. In this study, the sensitivity observed with the archived serum samples was < 30% (data not shown). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchial aspirates, lung biopsies, post-mortem tissue specimens and sputum appear to be more suitable for culture and PCR, but most of these specimens are not readily obtainable and are not usually taken for diagnosis [6, 31]. Nevertheless, these clinical specimens are valuable for validation of this diagnostic assay. The level of the impurities, such as human genomic DNA, protein and carbohydrates, varies among different types of specimen, and pathogen concentration in a clinical sample is significantly lower than that in laboratory cultures.",
