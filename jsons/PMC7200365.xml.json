Emerging reports across countries indicate higher COVID-19 mortality among men compared to women, but the underlying reasons remain unclear [2]. The extent to which this disparity is due to biological rather than behavioral or comorbidity sex differences is unknown. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the co-receptor serine protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in lung and other tissues implicated in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. However, less is known about the exact cell types expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 that serve as cells of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 [3].",

Given high TMPRSS2 expression in the prostate, we investigated whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in human prostate epithelial cells. Using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data, we analyzed 24 519 epithelial cells from a normal human prostate data set. In this data set (Supplementary material), 0.32% of all epithelial cells (78 of 24 519) expressed ACE2 and 18.65% expressed TMPRSS2 (4573 of 24 519). Overall, the prostate cell types co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were hillock and club cells that were originally identified in lung. We identified 0.61% of club cells and 0.40% of hillock cells that were double-positive (Fig. 1\n; Supplementary Fig. 1).",

Examining the cell types expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we found that pneumocytes I/II in males compared to females had a higher proportion of cells with expression (Supplementary Fig. 2C). It is not clear if TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression is regulated by the same process, but their expression levels are positively correlated in lung cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3).",
