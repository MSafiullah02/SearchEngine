We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual-and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of confirmed infected cases to date. Using data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose more systematic methods to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and uncertainties in the data.",

Clearly, this estimate would correspond to the actual mortality ratio if (i) all infecteds were tested and (ii) all remaining unresolved individuals recover. However, some infected patients will die, increasing the estimated mortality ratio over time. Despite the underestimation of this type of population-based measurement, it is still commonly being used by various health officials and is often inconsistently defined as deaths/(deaths + recovereds) even though this difference has been clearly distinguished [13] .",

Importantly, these models incorporate the duration of infection (including an incubation period) before a patient tests positive at time t = 0. However, the CFR and other mortality measures are typically reported based on population data. Do these population-based measures, including CFR, provide reasonable measures of the probability of death of an individual? Also in the Results, we describe how mortality ratios are defined within population-level models, specifically, a disease duration-structured SIR model. We will show that population-based estimates are typically not a meaningful measure of mortality, but that under simplifying assumptions, the mortality ratio M p (t) = D(t)/(D(t) + R(t)), where R(t) is the number of recovereds up to time t, is more closely related to the true probability of death M 1 (t) [13] . The simplest population-level mortality ratio is currently (as of March 31, 2020) Estimates of mortality ratios (see Eqs. (8) and (14)) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in China and Italy. The \"delayed\" mortalityratio estimate CFR d corresponds to the number of deaths to date divided by total number of cases at time t \u2212 \u03c4res. Many studies use CFR d , although this metric underestimates the individual-based mortality (defined below). Another populationbased mortality ratio is M 0 p (t), the number of deaths divided by the sum of death and recovered cases, up to time t. The data are based on Ref. [14] .",

We use the same estimates for the rate parameters in our individual and population models to compute the different mortality ratios.

By critically analyzing these estimates, the CFR, and a \"delayed\" case fatality ratio CFR d , we illustrate and interpret the differences among these measures and discuss how changes or uncertainty in the data affect them.

We also first assume that the susceptible population does not change appreciably before quarantine and set S(t) = S(0). Thus, we only need to solve for I(\u03c4, t) in Eqs. (9) and (10). We solve Eqs. (9) and (10) numerically (see the Methods section for further details) and use these numerical solutions to compute D 0,1 (t), R 0,1 (t), and N 0,1 (t) (see Fig. 3 (a) and (b)), which are then used in Eqs. (14) and CFR d (t \u2212 \u03c4 res ). To determine a realistic value of the time lag \u03c4 res , we use data on death/recovery periods of 36 tracked patients [28] and find that patients recover/die, on average, \u03c4 res = 16.5 days after first symptoms occurred. We show in Figs. 3(c) and (d) that M 1 p (t) approaches the individual mortality ratioM 1 (\u221e) \u2248 0.1 given in the \"Intrinsic individual mortality rate\" subsection above. This occurs because the model for P (\u03c4, t) and I(\u03c4, t) are equivalent and we assumed the same initial distribution \u03c1(\u03c4 ; 8, 1.25) for both quantities. However, the populationlevel mortality ratios CFR d (t, \u03c4 res ) and M 0 p (t) also take into account recently infected individuals who may recover before symptoms. This difference yields different mortality ratios because newly infecteds are implicitly assumed to be detected immediately and all have \u03c4 1 = 0. Thus, the underlying infection-time distribution is not the same as that used to computeM 1 p (t) (see the SI for further details). The mortality ratios CFR d (t, \u03c4 res ) and M 0 p (t) should not be used to quantify the individual mortality probability of individuals who tested positive. Moreover, due to evolution of the disease, D(t), R(t), and N (t) do not change with the same rates during an outbreak, the population-level mortality measures CFR d (t, \u03c4 res ) and M 0 p (t) reach their final steady state values only after sufficiently long times (see Fig. 3(c) and (d) ).",

An undelayed transmission in a no-quarantine scenario causes relatively more new infecteds who have not had the chance to die yet, leading to a smaller mortality ratio M 0 p (t). Within our SIR model, delaying transmission reduces the number of infected individuals and deaths at any given time but increases the measured mortality ratio M 0 p (t). Without quarantine, the asymptotic values M 0 p (\u221e) and CFR(\u221e) will also change as a result of changing the transmission latency period, as shown in the SI.

We also discussed how statistical factors such as time of testing after infection (\u03c4 1 ) and testing ratio (f ) affect our estimates. In practice, the mortality ratios M 1 (t) and M 1 p (t) may provide good estimates of mortality of patients who have tested positive. In addition to our metrics and mathematical models, we emphasize the importance of curating individual cohort data.

Here, we have assumed that testing occurs only for the infected who can die. In this scenario, the IFR, or the true CFR of all infecteds, is then IFR(t) = D * 0 (t)/N T (t), where in analogy to Eqs. (11) and (12),andThe true mortality ratio is also straightforwardly defined by, for example,wherewith analogous expressions for D * 1 (t), R * 1 (t), and R u 1 (t). At long times, after resolution of all infecteds, the untested recovered population iswhich yields the asymptotic true ratio M 0,1 p (\u221e) = f M 0,1 p (\u221e) as described in the Discussion and Summary. In this simple rescaling to account for untested populations, we have assumed that all deaths come from the tested pool and that the recovery rate c is the same in the tested and untested pools.",

If the number of new infections decreases (e.g., due to quarantine measures), M 0 p (t) starts growing until it reaches its asymptotic value M 0 p (\u221e). Interestingly, the pre-asymptotic values of M 0 p (t) are smaller for larger infection rates \u03b2 1 (see Fig. S3(a) ). This counter-intuitive effect arises because larger values of \u03b2 1 generate relatively larger numbers of new infected which have a lower chance of dying before \u03c4 inc (see Eq. (4) in the main text). A similar effect occurs for non-delayed transmission (i.e., \u03c4 \u03b2 \u2248 0). As the transmission delay decreases, more secondary cases will result from one infection, leading to smaller values of M 0 p (t) in the initial exponential growth phase of an epidemic (see Fig. S3(b) ).",
