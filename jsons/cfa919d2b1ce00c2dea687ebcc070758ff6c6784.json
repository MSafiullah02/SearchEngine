Within China, a total of 80,955 cases are confirmed, with 4257 severe cases in mainland China (www.nhc. gov.cn). In severe cases of COVID-19, patients experience rapid disease progression and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] .",

As mortality rates among critically ill COVID-19 patients can be as high as 61.5% [4] , ECMO may play a role in reducing mortality rates [5] . The indications of using ECMO are \"For patients with severe ARDS, it is recommended to perform lung expansion. In the case of adequate human resources, prone positioning should be recommended for at least 12 hours per day for protective ventilation. If severe respiratory failure persisted, then ECMO should be started as soon as possible.\" [6] Worldwide data on prognosis when using ECMO to treat critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection are not available, and whether ECMO plays a role in reducing patient mortality rates is currently unknown. This research letter provides the first evidence of prognosis in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients with ECMO in China. These preliminary data were collected from two medical centers of Wuhan, China (Table 1) . These data could be of considerable value in judging whether ECMO should be recommended as a salvage therapy for critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

Based on the two cohort case series in this study, nearly half of the critically ill COVID-19 patients with ECMO were dying from septic shock and multiple organ failure. As anticipated by MacLaren et al. [3] , COVID-19 is a pandemic; all healthcare resources are stretched so that ECMO is not a therapy to be rushed to the frontline. Therefore, interim treatment guidelines [5, 6] of recommending ECMO for critically ill COVID-19 patients should be taken cautiously. ",
