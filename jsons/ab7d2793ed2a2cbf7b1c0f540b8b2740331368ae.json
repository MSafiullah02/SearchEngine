When the idea of downloading online resources from or about China was first brought up in late 1999 in Heidelberg, it was by no means clear what this would mean. The still much undeveloped idea was introduced as a possible part of larger application for creating a European Center for Digital Resources in Chinese Studies aiming at the improvement of the conditions for China-related research and information access in Europe. The project included a number of activities such as purchasing a wide range of commercial full-text databases, supporting the development of academic database projects as well as developing own ones, developing finding aids for printed and non-printed resources on China, and, above all, providing free access to all resources as widely as possible. 3 The project was granted a term of five years, including the financial means to improve an already existing hardware environment and to hire some personnel in the form of student assistants.",

What would it mean to aim at long-term accessibility of archived resources? What were the requirements on hardware and software to create and maintain such an archive? How the selection of resources should be organized as an ongoing task, and how should the data be made accessible?

However, it was felt that if we could preserve the original bit stream most of the requirements above should be met. When downloading whole websites, the original file structure should be kept intact. Of course, to keep linking between the downloaded documents intact all links had to be converted into relative links on the fly. We needed thus configurable crawling software that was able to perform this task.

Or better: would it be possible to solely rely on search algorithms to retrieve all data needed for access as well as for long-term preservation purposes? From the user's perspective it was argued that full text search was a much more reliable tool for finding documents than crude subject headings or title words contained in often imperfect metadata. From the technical point of view much of the necessary information such as file format, download date, encoding, etc. should easily be retrievable from the data themselves, or else could be made part of the file naming structure. In the end this idea was rejected. Digital resources are an extremely volatile form of information, and separate documentation on these resources is necessary to ensure their integrity and accessibility for the long-term future. Depending on the data themselves for this kind of information makes them extremely vulnerable and prone to rapid decay. 9 To make the task manageable and to better integrate the archived material into the holdings of the library at large it was decided to create metadata as part of our regular catalogue. The catalogue was thus adapted to 9 Discussion and a framework of preservation metadata for digital resources can be found at the homepage of the joint OCLC/RLG project \"PREMIS -PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies\",http://www.oclc.org/research/ projects/pmwg/.",

Providing an informed selection of resources is thus an asset that helps current as well as future users to detect material we believe to be relevant. Of course values will change over time, and later generations might well have preferred different choices. In this case the Internet Archive still provides a very rich alternative where other choices will be available. It is the combination of the two approachesselective and holistic -that provides the future user with the widest array of possibilities for his or her research. At the same time, however, we do want to reduce the danger of being too narrow in our selection. As will be discussed below, DACHS is evolving into a larger cooperative project.

They also allow for a distribution of workload, thus providing means of cost reduction and the possibility of a wider selection of archived resources. Hardware, experience and quality standards can also be meaningfully shared and might improve the overall performance of the archive. Not the least important are partnerships as part of a political strategy.

This not only requires a central access point in the form of a joint home page, but also considerations about how these search options need to be constructed to serve the desired purpose. Full text search must be possible across different domains, and for the metadata either a union catalogue is needed where all data are physically stored together, or a virtual catalogue has to be constructed that searches the various local metadata and presents them in a coherent manner. In any case there is a strong need to establish shared standards for the creation of the metadata.",

At the time DACHS started operation in 2001 Web archiving was still in its infancy, and many big players of today only just started to develop and publish their efforts. Although the software we chose for our purpose at the time fulfilled most of our needs to our satisfaction, the tools available by now are much better suited for the task. Without going into the details of possible candidates -this is done elsewhere in this book -it remains clear that a new choice will have to be made for our project in order to streamline the ingest process and creation of metadata.",
