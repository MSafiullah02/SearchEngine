This is actually useful for public health authorities to assess situations quickly, to take and enforce informed decisions, and to optimize vaccination and drug delivery policies. Initially, the main attention focused on static networks, where each node represents an immobile agent and the contagion occurs only between neighboring nodes: it was revealed that scale-free networks display a vanishingly small epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic limit [5], [6]. After that, the focus shifted to reaction-diffusion models [7], [8], [9], [10], flow-driven epidemics [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], objective spreading [16], [17] and adaptive behaviors [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Finally, in a third stage, multilayered [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] and temporal [33], [34] networks were assumed to play a critical role on such processes.",

            "text": "A common feature in past studies is the use of phenomenological models which typically produce a single peak of infected density in each individual epidemic spreading. An interesting question is therefore whether or not all real evolutionary processes are conveniently represented by such a framework. A scrupulous analysis of a large number of real data from different cities over the world surprisingly shows that, besides a major pattern made of a single peak, there is a finite and non negligible probability for a new pattern of epidemic outbreak featuring two (or multiple) peaks. Notice that a two peaks pattern implies two outbreaks in a single spreading period, i.e. a secondary occurrence of the same epidemics, which may in turn produce severe calamities and disasters within unprepared populations. Understanding the underlying mechanism at the basis of this new pattern (with the help of a novel model extracted from real data) is therefore quintessential to properly cope with such life-threatening hazards. Previous studies showed that the phenomenon of multiple peaks in epidemics may occur in weak coupled different communities, where a full homogeneous mixing cannot be assumed [35], [36], [37], [38]. Considering that human behaviors occur in social networks, a key problem for further studies is how the network structures influence the formation of two-peaks patterns and the transition between the case of single peak and that of two peaks.",

As social activities and interactions occur in network structures, we here consider the epidemics in different geographic regions (or cities) as that occurring in multilayered graphs. Namely, we will take two coupled neighboring regions as an example, and construct a two-layered network model which fully reproduces the observed patterns of epidemics. In particular, we demonstrate that the pattern of two peaks originates from large time delays of epidemic outbreaks between the two layers, which depends in turn on both the difference in the degree distributions of the two layers and a weak coupling condition between them. To better understand the findings, an edge-based theory is developed which perfectly agree with the numerical simulations.",

Based on the detected trend of spreading of infections such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), H1N1 (Swine Influenza), H5H1 (Avian Influenza), and Ebola, one can indeed attempt to enforce suitable measures able to reduce the epidemic at its maximum extent. For this purpose, many countries have established their sentinel surveillance systems to collect epidemic data. For instance, Hong Kong Department of Health has organized a surveillance system, with the aim of collecting empirical data of infectious diseases, and of analyzing and predicting the trend of the infection. In such a system, there are about 64 General Out-Patient Clinics (GOPC) and 50 General Practitioners (GP), which form two distinct sentinel surveillance networks of the city [39], [40]. In these two networks, one obtains for instance the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness (per 1,000 consultations), which reflect the overall influenza-like illness activity in Hong Kong.",

From Fig. 1(a) one sees that there are many events of epidemic spreading, and the intervals between two consecutive events are not regular, indicating non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics [40]. On the other hand, one notices from Fig. 1(a) that most of the outbreaks correspond to a single peak of infected density, which is the pattern well described by the classical susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) models. However, one notices also that there is a finite probability for a novel pattern of epidemic outbreak which features, instead, two or multiple peaks. Fig. 1(b) shows one of such patterns (with two peaks) occurring at around 2005/6, which indicates that an infectious disease raised two times during that epidemic period in Hong Kong. Such unexpected phenomenon also exists in the data from GOPC (not shown here).",

In addition, two or multiple peaks of infected density may characterize the outbreaks in the total number of WMICs of two neighboring cities, also when uni-modal patterns are actually observed in each individual city. For example, Fig. 1(e) and (f) report the data of WMICs in Bristol and Newcastle [43]: the yellow line denotes the total number of WMICs, whereas the blue and green lines represent the data in Bristol and Newcastle, respectively. In Fig. 1(f) one can well appreciate that the pattern of two peaks occurs only in the total number of WMICs.

Finally, we study the influence of the exponent \u03b3 of the SF network. Fig. 3(d) shows that the bimodal feature is reduced with the increase of \u03b3.

From Fig. 4(a), one sees that when \u27e8kab\u27e9 is small, \u03c4 will decrease monotonically and be non-vanishing with the increasing of \u03b2ab, indicating that the event of two peaks always exists in the pattern. However, when \u27e8kab\u27e9 is increased, \u03c4 will decrease rapidly to zero, implying that there is a critical \u03b2abc for different \u27e8kab\u27e9. When \u03b2ab<\u03b2abc, the epidemic spreading event occurs through a pattern of two peaks in the infected density, while for \u03b2ab>\u03b2abc it occurs via the traditional pattern with a single peak. On its turn, Fig. 4(b) shows that \u03b4t decreases monotonically with the increase of \u03b2ab for all the three cases of \u27e8kab\u27e9, and it never vanishes. This is because the spreading speed is different in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Generally speaking, epidemic spreading is faster in heterogeneous network than in homogeneous network [46].",

While the network heterogeneity decreases with the increasing of \u03b3, it is easy to see that when \u03b3 is large, \u03c4 and \u03b4t decrease more prominently with \u03b2ab. Specifically, the difference of spreading speeds between the two layers is not distinctive for large \u03b3, resulting in the disappearance of the two peaks. Therefore, increasing the coupling strength (i.e. \u27e8kab\u27e9 and \u03b2ab) or decreasing the heterogeneity of network topology between the networks A and B will decrease the time delay of epidemic outbreak and then suppress the pattern of two peaks.",

For this purpose, we have also studied the case of SF-SF and RR-RR networks, respectively. Very interestingly, one finds that the pattern of two peaks can be still observed by adjusting the coupling strength between the coupled layers (see Fig. 8\n). Although the two coupled SF networks (or the two coupled RR networks) can be considered as the case with same heterogeneity, they are produced independently and thus their network topologies are different, indicating that there exists still the effect of heterogeneity between the two coupled networks. On the other hand, extension to three-layered model was also considered, and it was found that there is a small probability to produce a pattern of three peaks (see Fig. 9\n). Therefore, while in principle one can expect a multi-peaks pattern to occur in a multilayered network, the majority of unusual cases (i.e. cases in which the epidemic event is not happening with a single maximum of infected density) will be characterized by just two peaks, in full consistency with the data of Fig. 1.",

We here reported (from real data) the evidence that also a pattern of two peaks in a single epidemic period is possible. We pointed out that such a pattern is a genuine product of a multi-layered interaction structure, and we have introduced a proper model able to fully capture the mechanisms for its occurrence. Our model, together with reproducing the classical pattern of a single peak, can generate the pattern with two peaks when coupling between the layers is weak, while the difference in heterogeneity of the layers\u2019 structures is also helpful.",
