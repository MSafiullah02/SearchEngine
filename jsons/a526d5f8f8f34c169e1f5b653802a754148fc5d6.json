Methods This single-center, retrospective, observational study included the perioperative data of 123 patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck following oncological surgery. Patients were divided into the following two groups according to whether they received ANH: ANH group and non-ANH group. We investigated whether ANH can reduce the need for perioperative ABT using propensity score-adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 123 patients, 113 patients were assessed; 57 patients were in the ANH group and 56 patients were in the non-ANH group. The rate [ANH group vs. non-ANH group, n (%): 2 (3.5%) vs. 23 (41.1%), p < 0.0001] and amount [median (IQR): 0 mL (0, 0) vs. 0 mL (0, 280), p < 0.0001] of ABT were significantly lower in the ANH group than in the non-ANH group. Propensity score-adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ANH use [odds ratio (OR): 0.040; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.005, 0.320; p = 0.0024)] was one of the independent predictors of perioperative ABT. There were no significant differences in the incidences of post-operative complications between the two groups. Conclusion ANH use can reduce the need for perioperative ABT in patients undergoing free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck without increasing the incidence of post-operative complications.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that ANH has the potential to reduce the rate and amount of ABT because of less erythrocyte loss after hemodilution [8] . However, there has been no clinical investigation on the efficacy of ANH for reducing the need for perioperative ABT in free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck. Moreover, ANH reduces hematocrit during the surgical procedure and that contribute to the reduction in erythrocyte mass loss; however, hemodilution and fluid management could change the oxygen supply to the flap and post-operative course. The safety of ANH in reconstruction of the head and neck are still controversial. If ANH can reduce the rate and amount of ABT in free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck without increasing the incidence of post-operative complications, it could be an option which improves outcomes including cancer recurrence, post-operative infection, and flap success rate.",

The requirement of written informed consent from the patients was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study, and the Ethics Committee approved the waiver. This study enrolled 123 patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck following oncological surgery at Hirosaki University Hospital between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2019. Patients were excluded if they had preoperative anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] level less than 10.0 g/ dL), severe liver disease (Child-Pugh grade B or C), severe heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class 3 or 4), and end-stage kidney disease requiring intermittent hemodialysis, because these conditions met exclusion criteria for ANH. As low-volume ANH (5-8 mL/kg) has been reported to be ineffective for reducing the need for allogeneic transfusion and post-operative bleeding [9] , patients with an ANH withdrawal volume of less than 600 mL were excluded from the analysis. Patient characteristics and perioperative data were obtained from our hospital electronic medical and anesthesia records. Patient characteristics included sex, age, body mass index (BMI), medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS), diagnosis, pre-operative anticancer therapy, and TNM classification of malignant tumors. Perioperative data included ANH use, flap type (osseous or non-osseous), surgery duration, intraoperative crystalloid and colloid fluid administration, intraoperative blood loss and urine output, ABT amount until discharge from the intensive-care unit (ICU), ICU stay duration, and mechanical ventilation duration. The following pre-and post-operative laboratory data were measured when patients were admitted to the ICU: Hb level, hematocrit, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine level, lactate level, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and post-operative inotrope use. Additionally, Hb level, hematocrit and lactate level after hemodilution, intraoperative nadir Hb level and hematocrit, and maximum lactate level were assessed. Post-operative complications included flap failure with impaired blood flow, post-operative bleeding requiring hemostasis, surgical site infection, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and acute heart failure. Flap failure with impaired blood flow was classified into three categories; salvaged flap failure (flap ischemia salvaged by re-microvascular surgery), partial necrosis needed debridement, and total necrosis needed re-reconstruction. Additionally, we assessed death 0-90 days and 0-180 days after surgery. Patients were divided into the following two groups according to ANH use: ANH group and non-ANH group.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, ketamine, remifentanil, and/or fentanyl and rocuronium. After anesthetic induction, blood was withdrawn from the central venous line, and the withdrawn blood volume for ANH was selected to avoid an Hb level of less than 8.0 g/dL after hemodilution. The withdrawn blood volume was simultaneously replaced with an equal volume of 6% hydroxyethyl starch solution (130/4) (Volven; Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany). The collected blood was stored in a standard blood collection pack (JMS Blood Bag CPD400; JMS, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature (22-26 \u00b0C) on a shaker. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed and Hb and lactate levels were measured immediately after hemodilution and at least every 2 h during surgery to evaluate oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues.

The selected covariates included not only age, sex, BMI, ASA-PS of \u2265 3, pre-operative Hb level, and pre-operative anticancer therapy but also T3 stage or T4 stage and osseous free-flap reconstruction according to the existing knowledge that these were predictors of perioperative ABT [1] . We used the propensity score as a covariate in our model to adjust for pre-operative confounding factors. The presence of ANH was forced into the model as an explanatory variable. In addition, as intraoperative blood loss is related with perioperative ABT, this variable was forced into the model as a predictor. It has been suggested that the number of events per predictor variable in multivariate logistic regression analysis should be at least 10 to provide an adequate predictive model [12] . However, a recent simulation study suggested that 5-9 events per predictor variable were sufficient [13] . In this study, considering the number of events (25 patients received ABT), three variables were included in the model (one variable was included in the model for eight events). Variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to check for multicollinearity among the variables. Discrimination was measured using the area under the curve (AUC). The results are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",

The authors mentioned that these results were likely associated with greater intraoperative fluid administration in the ANH group than in the non-ANH group (8000 vs. 6000 mL). In contrast, the present study revealed that ANH use did not increase the incidence of perioperative complications. This might Fig. 1 Study population flowchart.

It has been reported that acute isovolemic reduction of the Hb level to 5.0 g/dL in conscious healthy resting humans does not show evidence of inadequate systemic oxygen delivery, as assessed by the lack of changes in oxygen consumption and the plasma lactate level [18] . In our institution, as the blood withdrawal volume for ANH was selected to avoid an Hb level of less than 8.0 g/dL after hemodilution and arterial blood gas analysis, Hb-level assessment and lactate-level assessment were performed at least every 2 h during surgery, ANH was conducted without an increase in the incidence of post-operative complications. In the present study, Hb level after hemodilution was more than 8.0 g/dL and maximum lactate level was not significantly different between the groups. However, the ideal Hb level for tissue oxygenation of a free flap remains unclear. Indeed, the lack of oxygen carriers during excessive hemodilution might cause hypoxic damage in surgical flaps [19] . In contrast, moderate hemodilution is known to facilitate microcirculatory blood flow in ischemic flaps by decreasing vascular resistance [20] . An animal experimentation study revealed that ANH could improve oxygenation in ischemic and hypoxic flap tissues [21] . Moreover, in a previous study, there were no differences in flap-related and medical complications between transfusion triggers of hematocrit less than 21% versus hematocrit less than 27% in free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck [22] . Thus, the present level of ANH for free-flap surgery was likely not to increase flap failure.",

Indeed, there was no significant difference in post-operative bleeding requiring hemostasis in the present study. Although the withdrawn whole blood was stored in a standard blood collection pack at room temperature (22-26 \u00b0C) on a shaker for more than approximately 8 h, the post-operative platelet count and coagulation ability were not significantly different between the two groups. A previous study reported that storage of whole blood for 24 h at room temperature resulted in a 23% decrease in the activity of Factor VIII, but caused no significant decrease in the activities of coagulation Factor V, Factor VII, Factor XI, Factor XII, fibrinogen, antithrombin, and von Willebrand factor [24] . This study concluded that storage of whole blood at ambient temperature for 24 h has a minimal effect on the coagulation activity of plasma and that this approach is an acceptable alternative to producing plasma on the day of blood collection.
