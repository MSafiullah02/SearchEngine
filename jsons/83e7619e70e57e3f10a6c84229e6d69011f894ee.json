Materials and methods In the present study, we investigated the expression of the major capsid protein (VP1) of the Genogroup II, genotype 17 (GII.17) NoV, using recombinant baculovirus system in insect cells, as well as a saliva binding blockade assay to detect their protective potency. Results Our results showed that GII.17 VLPs could be successfully generated in sf9 insect cells, and electron microscopic revealed that GII.17 VLPs appeared as spherical particles with a -35 nm diameter. Immunized mice with purified VLPs produced GII.17 specific sera and could efficiently block GII.17 VLPs binding to the saliva histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Conclusions Together, these results suggested that GII.17 VLPs represent a promising vaccine candidate against NoV GII.17 infection and strongly support further preclinical and clinical studies.",

            "text": "Human noroviruses (NoVs) infections are considered a significant public health problem, which cause more than 50% of non-bacterial gastroenteritis characterized by fever, vomiting and frequent episodes of diarrhea, especially in adults and children (Ahmed et al. 2014; Kaplan et al. 1982) . NoVs are divided into 5 genogroups designated GI through to GV and subdivided into 9 and 22 genotypes, which were first linked to human disease in 1972 (Kroneman et al. 2013; Zheng et al. 2006) . From the mid-1990s, Genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) NoV have predominantly occored as outbreaks, which emergence with new variants every two or three years (Ramani et al. 2014) . However, since the emergence of the novel Genogroup II, genotype 17 (GII.17) Kawasaki_2014 strain, a new pandemic strain has become predominant in the world. The novel GII.17 not only caused NoVs outbreaks but also spread sporadically with cases reported in China (Shanghai, Taiwan) and USA during the winter of 2014_2015 Lee et al. 2015; Parra and Green 2015) . From 2015, NoV GII.17 continued to spread to many countries in South America, Europe and Asia (Andrade et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2017; Khamrin et al. 2016 ). These epidemiological surveys indicated that NoV GII.17 is becoming an important etiological agent of gastroenteritis.",

The genomes are 7.4-7.7 kb in size and are typically organized into three open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins, such as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), while the structural proteins, such as the major and minor capsid protein (VP1 and VP2), are encoded by ORF2 and ORF3, respectively (Glass et al. 2009 ). VP1 is a 60 KDa protein that can be divided into a shell domain (S domain) and a protruding domain (P domain). The S domain forms a scaffold surrounding the viral RNA and is responsible for the shell structure of the capsid, whereas the P domain contains neutralizing epitopes and binds to the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) receptors, responsible for the genetic variability, builds the viral spikes and facilitates cell attachment (Debbink et al. 2012; Prasad et al. 1999; Tan and Jiang 2005) . VP2, a minor capsid protein, exhibit multiple functions, which are observed to stabilize and promote expression of VP1 (Lin et al. 2014) .",

Since GII.17 VLPs exhibited the strongest affinity to blood type AB salivary HBGAs, a blood type A saliva sample was selected for the blockade assay. For all reagents, sera dilutions and reaction times were optimized, and we conducted saliva-VLPs blocking assays using the mouse sera. The 96-well microplates were added to purified VLPs containing VLPs mice serum at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and diluted rabbit anti-GII.17-P domain monoclonal antibodies (Taizhou SCIVAC Bio-Tech CO., Ltd) were added. Wells added with VLPs that did not contain VLPs in the mice serum were selected as controls. The blocking index was calculated in % as (mean OD without VLP sera-mean OD with VLP sera)/mean OD without VLP sera 9 100% (Huo et al. 2016b ).",
