            "text": "Viruses are spherical or complex shaped carriers of proteins, nucleic acids and sometimes lipids and sugars. They are metastable and poised for structural changes. These features allow viruses to communicate with host cells during entry, and to release the viral genome, a process known as uncoating. Studies have shown that hundreds of host factors directly or indirectly support this process. The cell provides molecules that promote stepwise virus uncoating, and direct the virus to the site of replication. It acts akin to a snooker player who delivers accurate and timely shots (cues) to the ball (virus) to score. The viruses, on the other hand, trick (snooker) the host, hijack its homeostasis systems, and dampen innate immune responses directed against danger signals. In this review, we discuss how cellular cues, facilitators, and built-in viral mechanisms promote uncoating. Cues come from receptors, enzymes and chemicals that act directly on the virus particle to alter its structure, trafficking and infectivity. Facilitators are defined as host factors that are involved in processes which indirectly enhance entry or uncoating. Unraveling the mechanisms of virus uncoating will continue to enhance understanding of cell functions, and help counteracting infections with chemicals and vaccines.",

            "text": "Virus entry is the process by which the genome of a virus particle is delivered to the replication site, which can be in the cytosol, on cytoplasmic membranes or in the nucleus. The viral uncoating program is encoded in the viral genome together with the blueprint for the production of progeny viruses. The majority of viruses link their uncoating program to the endocytic machinery (for summary, see Figure 1 ) (1) . The details of uncoating are highly variable depending on the nature of the virus and the cell. However, the profile of events is similar for most viruses. It involves a stepwise process with a final step, the release of the genome from a protective, confining capsid structure (2, 3) . The final step enables transcription and replication, or in the case of DNA and RNA retroviruses the stable maintenance of the viral genome in the host nucleus. As a rule, complete uncoating occurs once the capsid has reached its final destination (4) . The steps of uncoating are regulated by cellular cues, which directly act on the virus. Here we have categorized cellular factors exerting cues to promote entry and uncoating of the incoming particle. The three major cues come from host receptors, enzymes and small chemicals including ions. The scheme depicts cellular cues (receptors, enzymes and chemicals including ions) and their cellular processes implicated in the stepwise uncoating of incoming virus particles. After binding to the cell surface via receptors and attachment factors, viruses are typically taken up into endocytic vacuoles following activation of signaling. They penetrate endosomes to enter the cytoplasm. Inside endosomes, viruses can be primed via endosome maturation, receptor binding, protease digestion or ions. In some cases, viruses fuse directly at the plasma membrane to enter the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, viruses can be exposed to cellular cues and processes which culminate in the completion of uncoating and release of the viral genome from the capsid. The viral genome is transported to the site of replication, which may be in the cytosol, on cytoplasmic membranes or in the nucleus. Receptor cues (green), enzymatic cues (pink), chemical cues (blue) and cellular processes (white) implicated in viral uncoating are indicated. Facilitators are not shown.

The (NA) of H5N1 influenza A virus was shown to have high catalytic activity at low pH, and to cleave glycosylated LAMPs. The main activity of NA is to release newly assembled virus particles from the cell surface (35) .

This is due to acid-induced conformational changes of the capsid independent of the viral glycoproteins (37) (38) (39) . Assembled adenovirus particles contain an estimated internal pressure of 30 atmospheres, which is thought to assist in the stepwise virus disassembly process, starting at the physically weakest spot of the virus, the fivefold symmetrical vertex (2, 11, (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) . Chemical and mechanical stability have been known to correlate in bacteriophage T7 (45) , and internal pressure with capsid stiffness in phage phi29 (46) . The resistance of the adenovirus vertex depends on virus maturation, which is mediated by the adenovirus cysteine protease AVP (47, 48) , and also on innate factors against the virus, such as defensins which bind to and stabilize the vertex region (49) . Pressure within the virus particle is built up by electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged dsDNA strands, DNA bending and entropic components, and is thought to weaken the pentons (50) . It eventually facilitates genome ejection for DNA translocation into the nucleus, a strategy acquired by bacteriophage and certain eukaryotic viruses such as herpesviruses (46, 51) .",

            "text": "The assembly-disassembly paradox How can a virus be assembled in an infected cell and fall apart (disassemble) during entry into an uninfected cell? One possibility is that virus capsid is assembled as a stable structure in an infected cell and rendered metastable, for example by limited proteolysis, such that it can receive cues from the host (3). A well studied example here is adenovirus (48) . A second possibility is that the virus particle itself is unchanged during assembly and egress, but that the infected and uninfected cells are different. An uncoating factor may be absent (inactive) during assembly, but present (active) during viral entry. Semliki Forest virus (SFV; see Box 2) and influenza virus use this strategy (25, 57, 58) . During assembly of influenza virus, proton flux through the viral M2 ion channel, which is present in the Golgi membrane, neutralizes the acidic pH of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and thereby prevents activation of the newly synthesized hemagglutinin (HA) to its fusogenic form (59) (60) (61) (62) . A third possibility is that the virus is unchanged but assembly and uncoating are spatially separated (3, 63) . Polyomaviruses, for example, are uncoated in the ER, but assembled inside the nucleus (18, 64) . Influenza viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNPs) are prevented from re-import after replication, or following microinjection into infected cells due to vRNP binding to newly expressed viral matrix protein (M1) (65, 66) . Replicated adenovirus DNA cannot undergo inter-nuclear spreading upon fusion of an infected cell with uninfected neighboring cells (67) . To be infectious, progeny viruses must be released and go through an uncoating program during entry into a new cell.",

HBV enters the nucleus to generate a covalently closed circular viral DNA genome (cccDNA) and to transcribe this genome. During the import process, immature capsids are initially trapped within the NPC via Nup153, and then undergo a maturation process and disassembly, which releases viral DNA and attached viral DNA polymerase to the nucleus by an nuclear localization signal (NLS)-dependent process (99, 100) . Nuclear cccDNA is maintained in infected hepatocytes, and used for reduplication and assembly of progeny virus. The high persistence of cccDNA makes pharmacological treatment of chronically HBV infected individuals difficult (101, 102) . Parvoviruses are thought to enter the nucleus as intact particles, or by transiently disrupting nuclear membranes, followed by disassembly in the nucleus, albeit mechanisms are unknown (103, 104) .",

They resemble a twisted rod (10-15 nm in width and 30-120 nm in length) that is folded back and coiled on itself (106, 107) . Studies using amantadine have shown that acidification of the viral core in endosomes via the viral M2 channel is essential for the dissociation of incoming nucleocapsids in the cytosol following fusion (108, 109) . After capsid uncoating, the vRNPs are released into the cytosol. Nucleoprotein (NP), the main component of vRNPs, contains NLSs necessary for nuclear import (110) (111) (112) (113) (114) (115) .

Baculoviruses are an exception, and after fusion at the plasma membrane the nucleocapsids move on actin tails through the cytoplasm in random directions (132) . When they collide with the nucleus, they may be proximal to an NPC and dock to it for a few minutes. Thereafter the nucleocapsid (diameter 30-60 nm) is thought to squeeze through the pore, as suggested by electron micrographs (133), followed by uncoating in the nucleus. Actin nucleation of baculovirus is mediated by Arp2/3 (134) and depolymerization of actin inhibits viral entry and infection kinetics (132) .",

HPV16 is the causative agent of cervical cancer (135) . It has evolved a strategy contingent with cell tropism in mucosal epithelia, and the skin, involving basal keratinocytes, which can be infected upon wounding. It establishes persistent infection. After endocytosis, the virus travels from the endosome to the TGN and ER in a retromer-and \u03b3-secretase dependent manner (136, 137) . Furthermore, access of the subviral DNA/L2 complex to the nucleus depends on mitotic breakdown of the nuclear membrane (138, 139) , or direct transfer from the ER into the nucleus during reassembly of the nuclear envelope (137) . This correlates with the notion that papillomavirus exclusively infects basal stem cells that undergo cell division (140) . Gamma-retroviruses must also wait for nuclear membrane breakdown during mitosis for nuclear delivery of preintegration complexes (141) (142) (143) .",

            "text": "Light microscopy, electron microscopy and correlative microscopy. The imaging field has seen enormous progress in recent years, including wide field microscopy and total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF), atomic force microscopy (AFM), automated high-throughput imaging, lattice light-sheet microscopy and super resolution microscopy (25, 95, 144, 145) . Advance and dissemination of technology has revolutionized the field of virus entry. Imaging-based entry assays have been developed to quantify distinct step of virus entry (146, 147) . Ethynyl-nucleotide labeling using EdA/U/C and CLICK chemistry enables temporal and spatial mapping of the virus genome of adeno, vaccinia, papilloma and herpes virus (95, 148) . The same technique was used to detect cellular DNA synthesis upregulation by paracrine signaling from a herpesvirus-infected cell to a remote, uninfected cell (149) . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used to detect incoming viral genomes and viral genome uncoating for coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus or influenza virus (91, 150, 151) . It is of note, however, that FISH is inherently non-quantitative, as the procedure tends to underestimate the amount of cytoplasmic viral genomes due to extraction in the denaturation process (91) . This clearly favors bioorthogonal click-chemistry based approaches that have single molecule sensitivity (95, 152) . Wide field fluorescence microscopy is increasingly used for automated analysis and quantification of virus spreading phenotypes in cell cultures (153, 154) . For example, Plaque2.0 is a high-throughput software method yielding multi-parametric datasets of virus spreading in 2-D monolayers. It is compatible with immuno-cytochemistry and FISH. Proximity-dependent DNA ligation assay (PLA) has been used to detect incoming papillomavirus to the TGN and ER (136, 137, 155) . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to study directional exit of the rhinovirus genomic RNA from the capsid (56) . At the ultrastructural level, the combination of light and electron microscopy using a correlative light electron microscopy approach provides a powerful tool for the study of dynamic intracellular membrane trafficking events, virus entry and replication with high sensitivity and spatial precision (156) (157) (158) (159) . Such technologies may, in the future, enable detection of particular virus entry steps with greater accuracy and resolution, and give deeper insight into cell-cell variability of infection events. Reverse genetics. The advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering of RNA viruses has transformed the field of virology by permitting study of targeted genetic changes in virus genomes (for examples see [160] [161] [162] . Pseudoviruses and virus like particles (VLPs) can be generated from cloned cDNAs, for example, allowing for reverse genetics and introduction of fluorescent probes (163) (164) (165) (166) (167) . Beta-lactamase (BlaM) viral core chimeras, such as BlaM fused to HIV-1 viral protein R (vpr) can be used to detect virus uncoating with high sensitivity (168, 169) . Systems virology. Systems-level analyses are potent hypothesis generators, and analyses of systems data, in combination with mathematical modeling, are used to generate comprehensive, integrated and predictive models of biological systems and virus-host interactions (170) . Over the last decade, genome-wide RNAi screens have provided novel leads to study virus-host interactions (171) . For example, such screens found that the interferon inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are involved in entry of H1N1 influenza, West Nile and Dengue virus (172) . A recently established trifunctional reagent for ligand derivatization, termed TRICEPS, can be used to identify potential viral receptors on the cell surface (173) . The proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) technique allows in silico derivation of proteomes from transcriptomes. This allows generation of viral and host protein databases for non-model species (174) . Quantitative proteomics can provide essential information on posttranslational protein modifications and interactions with other proteins. Among recent progress are studies with hepatitis C and influenza viruses (175) (176) (177) (178) , identifying serum response factor binding protein 1 as a potential uncoating factor for hepatitis C (177) . VirScan is a versatile, high-throughput method to comprehensively analyze antiviral antibodies displaying proteome-wide coverage of peptides from all human viruses, from a single drop of blood (179) . Evidently the synergy between molecular biology, viral immunology and systems virology reveals novel insights into virus entry and infection biology.",

They found that penetration of SFV was triggered by low pH. The virus responded to this chemical cue by activating the fusion spike glycoproteins, which then mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the limiting membrane of the early endosome, followed by penetration of the viral capsid into the cytosol (180, 181) . Within about a minute of reaching the cytoplasm the capsid was fully uncoated by the 28S large ribosomal subunit, leaving the viral RNA bound to the cytosolic surface of endosomes, where replication occurred (182, 183) . Viruses that failed to escape from endosomes were delivered to lysosomes and eventually degraded (184) . Infected cells became resistant to superinfection with SFV but not influenza virus. It is thought that the uncoating capacity of the ribosomes is inactivated during SFV replication precluding superinfection, and protecting progeny capsids from disassembly (57). Helenius and coworkers recently showed that immediately after uncoating the cellular RNA helicase Upf1 and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (185-187) restrict SFV replication by degrading incoming genomic (+)RNA (188) . It is possible that alphavirus replicases compete with NMD to evade host restriction. establishment of homeostasis and long term cell survival (189) . An emerging feature of viral entry and uncoating is the mimicking of misfolded protein aggregates, so called 'waste proteins', in order to hijack cellular quality control processes that dispose of waste.",

            "text": "Influenza virus is an enveloped virus. It uses histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) for uncoating. HDAC6 plays a central role in regulating both the concentration and autophagic clearance of protein aggregates (25, (190) (191) (192) (193) . After binding to sialic acids at the cell surface, influenza virus is taken up by both clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and macropinocytosis (194) (195) (196) (197) . Virus uptake is facilitated by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that is mediated by epidermal growth factor (EGFR) (198) . The viral core is primed for uncoating in endosomes by H + and K + influx through the M2 ion channel (199) (200) (201) (202) (203) , followed by HA-mediated viral fusion at late endosomes which depends on low pH, CD81 and cathepsin W (204) (205) (206) . The capsid then exposes unanchored ubiquitin chains, a hallmark of misfolded protein aggregates. These chains are likely generated by deubiquitination of a poly-ubiquitinated misfolded protein that was not degraded by the proteasome (192, 207) . They are exposed to the cytosol and recruit the HDAC6 zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP). HDAC6 binds to M1 and links the capsid to dynein-, actomyosinand autophagy-dependent aggresome processing. The generated pulling force breaks the capsid, promotes vRNP release and infection (25, 191, 192) (Figure 3 ). Unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains are emerging as key factors in multiple cellular responses, including innate antiviral pathways (208) . It will be interesting to find out whether the incoming ubiquitin chains regulate downstream signaling events during and after influenza uncoating.",

Viral core uncoating is driven by these pre-packaged ubiquitinated proteins, rather than by de novo ubiquitination. The core is primed for uncoating by the acidic pH of macropinosomes, most likely through a proton channel in the viral membrane (211) . Following fusion, the core disulfide bonds are reduced in the cytosol. This and proteasome activity promote the disassembly of the lateral bodies (proteinaceous structures flanking the core of the virion), and the release of the viral phosphatase VH1 (212) . VH1 dephosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and protects the infected cells from IFN restriction (212) . In addition, core disassembly is dependent on the viral D5 primase/helicase, implicating that chemical energy is required for activating the process (145, (213) (214) (215) .",

The capsid is remodeled structurally and exposes a hydrophobic peptide which is inserted into the ER membrane (16, 18, 183) . The hydrophobic sequence recruits the ERAD, and the cytosolic protein disaggregation machinery Hsp105, and the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein \u03b1 (SGTA)-Hsc70 complex, which together translocate the penetrating capsid into the cytosol (17, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) .

It is proteolytically activated by endosomal cathepsins, and the cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin and trypsin (226, 227) . These steps are spatiotemporally controlled. Binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to its receptor angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) potentiates the S protein for cleavage by cathepsin L (228) (229) (230) (231) . The virus acquires fusogenicity in NPC1-positive endolysosomes where cathepsin L activity is high (232) . Likewise, the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) undergoes cleavage by a furin-like protease twice (233, 234) . The first cleavage happens during",

These are involved in complicated trafficking, sorting and maturation processes encompassing hundreds of cellular factors. During endosome maturation the incoming viruses can gain exclusive exposure to cues that are not available on the plasma membrane or in the cytosol (27, 28) . This is supported by the notion that defects in endosome or macropinosome maturation on the pathway from the plasma membrane to lysosomes inhibits the productive entry of many viruses (8, 30, 202, 235, (252) (253) (254) (255) (256) (257) (258) (259) (260) (261) (262) (263) . Along the same lines, virus entry can be inhibited by perturbations of microtubule-mediated vesicular traffic, conversion of Rab5 early to Rab7 late endosomes, or the formation of intralumenal vesicles (27) . In addition, endosomal cathepsins and furin-like proteases activate viral fusion proteins (264) . Other viruses use endosomal membrane proteins as intracellular receptors to execute particular steps of their entry program (9, 10) . Viruses that fail to escape from the endosome are eventually degraded in lysosomes. Endosomes can also trigger innate immunity against viruses. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) recognizes the ssRNA genomes contained within the influenza virion that are taken up into the endosome (265) (266) (267) .",

As shown in Figure 5 , adenovirus type 2 (HAdV-C2) uses membrane rupture twice, at the plasma membrane and endosomes, to gain entry into the cell. The virus first binds to its receptors coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and integrins (269, 270) . The combination of actomyosin-dependent drifting motion of CAR versus integrin-mediated confinement shears the capsid fibers and triggers conformational changes in the incoming capsid that enable externalization of the internal membrane lytic protein VI (11, 271) . Protein VI contains an N-terminal amphipathic helix, and thereby creates small lesions in the plasma membrane, promoting cytosolic Ca 2+ influx that in turn triggers lysosomal exocytosis and secretion of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) (272) . ASM converts cell surface sphingomyelin to ceramide. This promotes virus uptake, which is also cholesterol-and dynamin-dependent (259, 260) . Virus containing endosomes have a high ceramide level which favors the binding of protein VI to the lipid membrane and the disruption of the membrane. The concerted action of mechanical and chemical cues (actomyosin) together with receptors (CAR, integrin) and facilitators (ceramide) leads to enhanced rupture of the limiting membrane and escape of the virus from non-acidic endosomes to the cytosol (272).",

An emerging challenge is to translate the results from cell culture experiments to primary cells and tissues, initially with the help of animal models and then human samples. Another challenge is to account for the fact that viruses are a cohort of particles infecting their target cell, tissue, organ or organism. The entry pathways and uncoating factors may be different when cells are infected at low compared to high number of particles per cell (multiplicity). They may even depend on the nature of the producer and the target cells. For example, hepatitis A virus particles of the picornaviridae can be transmitted between cells as naked or lipid embedded capsids (275) . The entry pathways for adenoviruses in epithelial cells are different from those in immune cells (276) (277) (278) . In addition, the same virus can occur as diverse kinds of particles that use multiple entry pathways, such as spherical or filamentous influenza virus. All these features highlight the great adaptability and flexibility of natural infectious agents.",

            "text": "An emerging question for today's research in infectious disease is whether multiple virus infections affect one another. For this, methods to explore the complexity of the human virome in the host are being developed. For HAdV-C2/C5 binds to CAR and integrins on the cell surface, and the actomyosin-dependent drifting motions of CAR trigger fiber shedding (2, 11, 12, 40) . Virus binding to integrins induces signaling and virus uptake into endosomes in a dynamin-dependent manner (259, 260) , Protein VI is dislocated from the inside of the virus and binds to the plasma membrane, forming small pores that allow influx of Ca 2+ into the cytosol (272, 287) . This danger signal induces rapid lysosomal secretion of ASM to the cell surface. ASM converts SM into CER, which enhances endocytic uptake of the virus. Protein VI is recruited to CER on the internal surface of endosomes, inducing endosomal leakage and rupture, and thereby enables escape of viral particles into the cytosol (260, 272, 288) . Low pH is not required for virus penetration, but required to maintain functional secretory lysosomes (147) . Receptor cues (green), enzymatic cues (pink), chemical cues (blue), facilitators (brown), viral protein/process (gray) and endosomal markers (light blue) are indicated. Abbreviations: ASM, acid sphingomyelinase; CAR, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor; CER, ceramide; ITGN, integrin; SM, sphingomyelin; FACIL, facilitator; VIRAL, viral protein/process; RECEP, receptor cue; ENZYM, enzymatic cue; CHEM, chemical cue. example, VirScan recently identified an increased rate of antibodies against adenovirus species C and RSV in HIV-positive human individuals compared with HIVnegative individuals (179) . Are virus infections tuned by the bacterial microbiota? We believe that this is a relevant question, since mucosal surfaces of the oral, respiratory or intestinal tissues are major entry ports for viral pathogens into the human body, and these surfaces are colonized by microbiota, including billions of bacteria. We expect that in the near future the field of virus entry and uncoating will make increasing use of physiological model systems, quantitative omics, bioinformatics and eventually even personalized measurements.",
