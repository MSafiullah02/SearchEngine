The World Health Organization defines coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the infectious disease caused by laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2, with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (WHO, 2020). COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, or pneumonia. Some studies found that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic or presymptomatic period can be infectious (Bai et al., 2020 , Mao et al., 2020 . Current evidence on how long to quarantine asymptomatic carriers is limited. In recent paper, Mao was suspicious about the 14-day isolation period for asymptomatic carriers because it was based only on observations of two cases (Mao et al., 2020) . The shortage of isolation capacity in some countries is expected to lead to an explosive increase in COVID-19.",

Although the presence of viral RNA in specimens doesnot distinguish between infective and non-infective PCR was positive on the 19th day of isolation in patients receiving antiviral agents, which might have prolonged virus detection in the two asymptomatic carriers. A modelling study estimated that 18% would be true asymptomatic cases, including the incubation period (Mizumoto et al., 2020) . If the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is large, the cost of isolation for public health management may be enormous. Our data suggest that 14-days quarantine at home after diagnosis may be adequate in entirely asymptomatic carriers.",
