First of all, only reports in English/Chinese literature were included in our study, which led to the loss of raw data from reports in other languages. Furthermore, many studies indicated that some respiratory viruses present a strong seasonal pattern like influenza viruses. However, those data were not included for the meta\u2010analysis. Moreover, we did not correlate clinical severity of pneumonia with causative viral pathogens due to the lack of original data.",
