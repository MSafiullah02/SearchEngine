Since then, sporadic mini\u2010outbreaks have arisen from laboratory and various other sources, resulting in public panic as well as posting continuous reminders to the medical world of this new disease 2. The SARS epidemic, on the other hand, clearly demonstrated international co\u2010operation and advances in genomic technology 3. The causative agent of SARS, a new coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), was quickly identified and the genomes of various isolates were determined 4, 5, 6, 7. Patients with SARS\u2010CoV infection have a wide spectrum of disease, varying from a self\u2010limiting illness to a fatal outcome 8, 9. The clinical picture was dominated by respiratory system involvement 8, 10 but gastrointestinal symptoms were also common 11, 12. Raised creatine kinase, an increase in lactate dehydrogenase, and a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count are the most common laboratory findings. The best treatment protocol has not yet been defined, although vaccines are currently being developed in major centres around the world 13, 14, 15, 16. The factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood. The pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV infection remains uncertain.",

Several studies have attempted to characterize the lung pathology of SARS. Most of these studies analysed fatal cases, representing the more severe end of the clinical spectrum 8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. In the lung, diffuse alveolar damage and syncytial cells are most consistently seen. Using electron microscopy (EM) directly for viral particles, in situ hybridization (ISH) using various regions of the viral genome 23, 24, 25, and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies using antibodies against various viral proteins (Figure 1A and ref 26), SARS\u2010CoV infections have been clearly demonstrated in pneumocytes. This cell type is probably the primary target of SARS\u2010CoV.",

In one of two papers on SARS published in the June 2004 issue of The Journal of Pathology, Ding et al extended the list of organs harbouring the virus in fatal cases using both IHC with antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) protein and ISH 26. Among the various organs in which IHC and ISH are positive for SARS\u2010CoV, the presence of virus in the sweat glands suggests that SARS may be spread via contact with the skin. Although such a phenomenon has not been demonstrated clinically or epidemiologically, this finding might have major implications in clinical practice, infection control, and waste handling. Similarly, the presence of virus in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney is consistent with detection of the viral genome in urine and suggests that urine may be an additional source of sewage contamination 28. However, specific renal tissue damage was not observed, nor was viral tropism in kidney demonstrated in a previous ISH study 25, and the virus was not explicitly seen by EM 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.",

In both the liver and the kidney, signals for SARS\u2010CoV were detected by both IHC and ISH 26, yet EM failed to reveal recognizable viral particles. If the observations are real, this raises the question of whether the virus exists in a non\u2010packaged form. The discrepancy between these observations remains unexplained. The presence of viral infection in some endocrine organs such as the adrenals and the pituitary is puzzling. This finding might open up new insights into the pathophysiology of SARS. However, clinical presentations of SARS have not been linked to any particular endocrine disturbance.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metalloproteinase that has previously attracted attention as a result of its role in the cardiovascular system 31, was recently identified as the receptor of SARS\u2010CoV in Vero E6 cells by isolation of the receptor protein through its direct interaction with the Spike (S) proteins of the SARS\u2010CoV 32 and by expression cloning 33. Further biochemical analysis pinpointed specific regions of the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS\u2010CoV that interacted strongly with ACE2 34, 35. These findings will have important bearings on vaccine development. Transfection of ACE2 into NIH 3T3 cells apparently conveyed infectivity to these non\u2010permissive cells. Syncytium formation in ACE2\u2010transfected cells has also been reported 32. In the second paper on SARS published in the June 2004 issue of The Journal of Pathology, Hamming et al provided important information on the tissue and cellular distribution of ACE2 protein 36. The general pattern of ACE2 expression correlates roughly with the tropism of SARS\u2010CoV in fatal cases. In particular, ACE2 proteins were seen in the alveolar epithelial cells and surface enterocytes of the small intestine. The physiological role of ACE2 expression in these epithelial cell types is currently unknown. Interesting discrepancies between the tissue distribution of ACE2 and the tropism of SARS\u2010CoV are, however, immediately apparent. While high levels of ACE2 are seen in endothelial cells, viral infection has not been demonstrated extensively in these cells in any organ, although vasculitis has been reported 18. Similarly, ACE2 is clearly demonstratable by IHC in glomerular visceral and parietal epithelial cells as well as in the proximal tubules, but SARS\u2010CoV infection has not been observed in these cell types. In contrast, no ACE2 expression was noted in the different cell types in the liver, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and sinusoidal endothelium.",

Several intestinal cell lines were found to have significant expression of ACE2, but only one human intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line, Lovo, was eventually identified to be permissive for SARS\u2010CoV infection 37. In contrast to the infected Vero E6 cell line, Lovo cells showed no cytopathic effect upon infection by SARS\u2010CoV. Instead, persistent infection was observed. Virus particles, viral genome, and viral proteins were all demonstrated in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Lovo cells. This cell culture model appears to recapitulate the natural course of intestinal SARS\u2010CoV infection. It is apparent that the effect of SARS\u2010CoV infection is different in different cell types and it is possible that the virus may utilize different receptors, or involve various co\u2010receptors, in these different cells.",

Curiously, lymphoid cells and lymphoid organs, including the spleen, do not harbour SARS\u2010CoV. The viral genome has rarely been demonstrated in macrophages of the lung 39. The absence of viral proteins and viral particles, however, suggests a passive role for macrophages as scavengers, rather than being the primary target 25, 26. While direct infection of the lymphoid system by SARS\u2010CoV seems unlikely, elevated levels of certain cytokines and chemokines are consistently observed in the serum of SARS patients 40, 41. In addition, the severity of SARS\u2010CoV infection may be related to the HLA haplotypes of different individuals 42, 43. It is likely that there are complex interactions between SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells in various organs and the lymphoid network. Studies of expression and changes in cytokines, chemokines, and their corresponding receptors both at the tissue level and in individual cell types will be necessary to address these issues.",

However, the cellular and tissue responses in these sites are different. The possibility of another cellular receptor(s) or co\u2010receptor(s) remains open. The interaction between SARS\u2010CoV and the immunological or lymphoid system needs to be defined. Further insights into the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV may be gained from emerging new human cell culture models. As our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms improves, a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease.",
