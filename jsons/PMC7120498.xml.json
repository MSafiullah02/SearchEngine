The process of payment, which is the essential part of the transaction of smuggling, is not always concluded with the act of smuggling. It may extend well beyond that point. The form and method of payment often reach insidious proportions of exploitation where the smuggler may discourage payment at the outset, making the illegal migrant an easy victim to exploitation and abuse. In many cases, the person seeking to be smuggled into a country illegally welcomes such deferral of payment making the smugglers\u2019 business flourish through easier recruitment of candidates for illegal migration. This situation also strengthens the position of the smuggler to tighten his grip on the migrants and use their virtually indentured services for unlawful and criminal activities.",

This Resolution makes mention of smuggling of illegal migrants as an activity that endangers the lives of those smuggled and imposes severe costs on the international community. The United Nations noted that smuggling of aliens can involve criminal elements in many States and condemned the practice of smuggling aliens in violation of national and international law. Resolution 48/102, while urging States to adopt measures to frustrate the objectives and activities of smugglers of illegal migrants, identifies the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations that could consider ways and means to enhance international co-operation to combat the smuggling of aliens. At the same meeting, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 48/103 on crime prevention and international justice which reaffirmed the importance of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme and the crucial role the Organization has to play in promoting international co-operation in crime prevention and criminal justice.

Besides these advantages, the MRP also has decided security benefits, such as the possibility of matching very quickly the identity of the MRP owner against the identities of undesirable persons, whilst at the same time, offering strong safeguards against alteration, counterfeit or forgery. Another advantage of the MRP is the fact that the document obviates the need for the passenger to lodge embarkation or disembarkation cards, on the assumption that countries installing automatic reader equipment would accept the data on the passport as sufficient for their clearance purposes. Of course, the MRP had to offer safeguards equal to or better than those of conventional passports and satisfy those control requirements already set by conventional passports and other travel documents in use throughout the world.

The page has two areas\u2014with the visual-inspection zone on top of the page as the first area, and the machine-readable zone at the bottom, as the second area.

At the bottom\u2014in the machine readable zone, are prescribed data elements printed in machine readable form in a prescribed sequence and position. When being used, the MRP is opened at the page containing the visual-inspection and machine-readable zones and placed face down on a glass surface in the reading machine, thus activating an electro optical-scanning mechanism. The mechanism illustrates the two machine readable lines and surrounding background using a light source. The whole process operates on a principle of \u201clight absorption\u201d where the mechanism in the reader uses an optical sensor to measure the presence or absence of light reflecting off the page.

The first MRP was issued in the United States of America in 1981 and since then, well over thirty five million MRPs have been issued world-wide, while millions more are being issued every year in countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany. Technical specifications for MRP\u2019s were first published by ICAO in the First Edition of Doc 9303 in 1980, based on Standard 7501 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Developments in technology and modern exigencies of prolific air travel however, dictated that the specifications contained in Doc 9303 be improved. As the ICAO Panel on Passport Cards had been extinct with the publication of its Fifth Report in 1978, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) took it upon itself to establish a working group to update the provisions of Doc 9303 so that the outcome of their deliberations would be published as a new ISO Standard. The care taken by the ISO working group led to considerable time being taken by the working group, compelling ICAO to establish a new group to succeed its Panel on Passport Cards, namely, the Technical Advisory Group on Machine Readable Passports (TAG/MRP) which met for the first time in 1986. ICAO thus regained its lead in developing MRP specifications and co-ordinating with other organizations the task of developing a single set of specifications for machine readable travel documents. On the strength of ICAO\u2019s new leading role, the Air Transport Committee of ICAO widened the scope of the terms of reference of ICAO to include the development of specifications for machine readable visas and to provide for the Group\u2019s membership to include participation by the authorities responsible for visas. Accordingly, the ISO Technical Committee, in the light of ICAO\u2019s new role in updating specifications in Doc 9303, adopted a proposal to withdraw ISO Standard 7501, so that there would not be confusion by the introduction of double standards or \u201coverlapping\u201d of specifications of ICAO and ISO.",

Since the visa is inextricably linked to the passport, both the MRP and the MRV go side by side, and are not considered in isolation. As long as visas were required and needed to be attached to the passport, it was difficult to envisage the development of a Passport Card, and a booklet type passport was required for visual inspection. The MRV therefore is the main reason for the retention of the MRP concept in its present form. Since MRVs can be accommodated in any type of passport (whether machine-readable or conventional) the placement of an MRV in a conventional, non machine readable passport would make that passport machine readable, worldwide.",

The fundamental issue in the context of State responsibility for the purposes of this article is to consider whether a State should be considered responsible for its own failure or non-feasance to prevent a private act of terrorism against civil aviation or whether the conduct of the State itself can be impugned by identifying a nexus between the perpetrator\u2019s conduct and the State. One view is that an agency paradigm, which may in some circumstances impute to a state reprehensibility on the ground that a principal-agent relationship between the State and the perpetrator existed, can obfuscate the issue and preclude one from conducting a meaningful legal study of the State\u2019s conduct.001442\n",

Grave threats such as those posed by the carriage of explosives and dangerous pathogens on board, are real and have to be addressed with vigour and regularity. The leakage of dangerous pathogens001443 from laboratories also presents an ominous analogy to the aviation sector in that the same could well occur in the carriage of such dangerous goods by air.001444 Although past instances of the escape of dangerous pathogens are small in number, nonetheless their occurrence and the threat posed to the wellbeing of humanity cannot be underestimated. In 2002 when Anthrax spores escaped from two military laboratories in the United States, the authorities agreed that the leakage was due to a security lapse.001445 In 2003 a string of such leakages occurred in Asia, this time of the SARS virus.001446\n",

Ultimately, even though the chip incorporated in the ePassport is the creation of a public or private entity, is so incorporated in a State document\u2014i.e. the passport, and therefore the State is ultimately liable for defects in the passport. State liability under administrative law can in turn be divided into two limbs: liability for acts of instrumentalities of State; and liability for privatized service providers for whose acts, relating to the provision of technical services, the State would still bear responsibility. The traditional model of administrative responsibility and accountability of the administrative State is based on the premise that Parliament controlled the executive but was in turn controlled by the people. Added to this, the fundamental postulate lay in the overarching principle that the judiciary played its role in keeping instrumentalities and agencies of the State intact. Accountability of the State for its agencies\u2019 actions was twofold: one stemming from a statutory power given to that agency by the State; and the other arising from delegation of authority by the State to the agency concerned. In the latter instance, however, the legislature could intervene and share some control of the agency. This gave rise to the inexorable principle that administrative law and judgments of courts on such agencies could be involved only in the former instance, when the State had provided a statutory base for a private agency or entity. In the 1983 British case of O\u2019Reilly & Mackman,001449 the House of Lords limited the circumstances in which a public law remedy, such as a declaratory judgment or injunction, could be brought outside of Section 31 of the Supreme Court Act of 1918, which prescribed instances of legal actions to be brought against the State for an act of its statutory agent. This is notwithstanding the fact that Section 21 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1949 allows the Court in civil proceedings to issue a declaratory order against the State, although there could be no injunction specific performance orders against a State. Furthermore, a later case established that although the claim for judicial review might be brought against the Crown, the Crown\u2019s involvement is merely nominal and the ultimate dispute would be between the claimant and the defendant.001450 It is with the 1990 decision in the Factorframe Case001451 where Lord Bridge stated that injunctive relief against the Crown or its officers was not possible.",

The corollaries to privatization are often the widening of share ownership; encouraging share ownership by employees; providing more flexibility to pay policies; and enhancement of economic freedom. There could be two types of privatized service providers: the first being large companies which were once instrumentalities of state, which, even after privatization, do not possess potential for undue competition in the market. These would easily transit to a position in which large companies had been private in the first place, and would not be subject to principles of public law. The second category of the privatized service provider is one which has market power and consequent potential for untrammelled competition. In such cases, the State may regulate the provider by bringing it under the administrative purview of a State agency. These privatized bodies may be vulnerable under public law through the agencies having administrative control over them.",

The Director General of Telecommunications, established by the Act, can grant licenses to operators of telecom systems. The Director General is also empowered to refer a matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, particularly on issues related to public interest such as pricing. If this particular feature were to be applicable to a privatized air navigation service provider appointed under Statute, there would be the interesting consideration under public law whether that provider complied with Article 15 of the Chicago Convention001454 on charges for services.",
