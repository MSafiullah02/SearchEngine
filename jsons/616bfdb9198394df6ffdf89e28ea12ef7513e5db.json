            "text": "We propose a Susceptible-Infected (SI) epidemic spreading model including containment measures. In absence of containment measures the epidemics spreads exponentially fast for any value of the infectivity \u03bb > 0. The containment measures are modeled by considering a time-dependent modulation of the bare infectivity \u03bb leading to an effective infectivity that decays in time for each infected individual, mimicking for instance the combined effect of asymptomatic onset of the disease, testing policies and quarantine. We consider a wide range of temporal kernels for the effective infectivity and we investigate the effect of the considered containment measures. We find that not all kernels are able to push the epidemic dynamics below the epidemic threshold, with some containment measures only able to reduce the rate of the exponential growth of new infected individuals. We also propose a model with pandemic caused by a growing number of new separated foci. This model provides a stylized mathematical framework that can shed light on the role of different containment measures in mitigating and suppressing the spread of an epidemics such as COVID-19.",

The scientific community is responding to this emergency by proposing modeling frameworks to study the effect of various containment measures [1] [2] [3] and testing and immunization policies [4] [5] [6] , analyzing data [7, 8] and by studying different scenarios for the future evolution of the pandemic. Here we take a more abstract approach, namely we introduce and analyze a simple mathematical model of epidemic spreading mimicking containment measures that can help to understand the dynamics at the onset of a pandemic.",

            "text": "The study of epidemics has a fascinating history [9, 10] . Epidemic modeling goes back to Daniel Bernoulli who modeled the spread of smallpox [11] . The modeling literature grows at an accelerating pace as the new challenges ranging from HIV [12, 13] and computer viruses [14] , to innovation, rumor spreading [15] [16] [17] [18] and now COVID-19 (see e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [19] [20] [21] [22] and references therein) continue to emerge. Epidemic spreading processes are described not only in mathematical biology books [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , but also in statistical physics [28] and network theory textbooks [29] [30] [31] [32] and topical reviews [33] . The Susceptible-Infected (SI), Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) are especially popular epidemic models. These models have been studied on well-mixed populations where every individual can be in contact with any other (see [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] 34] for a review), on networks [33] or in a meta-population framework [35] formed by several well-mixed populations interacting through a network [36] . In all these models when the infectivity \u03bb of an infected individual exceeds the epidemic threshold \u03bb c , at the onset of the epidemic outbreak the spread is exponentially fast in time [29] . When \u03bb < \u03bb c , the epidemics quickly dies out. A very interesting regime is the critical one in which the infectivity \u03bb is close to the epidemic threshold \u03bb c ; the behaviors in this regime are non-trivial and not yet fully understood even in the realm of the classical models such as SIR, see [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , but at least it is well established that such epidemics cannot affect a finite fraction of population.",

For epidemic spreading models defined on networks, the epidemic threshold depends on the network topology [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Here we take a well-mixed population approach and neglect network effects. This is justified by the consideration that before strict containment measures the contact networks in urban centers are in first approximation well-mixed due to the presence of social activities and public transportation. In presence of strict containment measures the contact network is much sparser but the spread of the disease is likely to be due to random encounters outside of the households, justifying in first approximation the well mixed approximation also in this case.",

In this framework there are only susceptible individuals that do not carry the infection and infected individual that can carry the infection. The epidemic dynamics is very simple as the only possible transition we take into account is the transition of an individual from the susceptible to the infected state if it is in contact with an infected individual. This is an idealized scenario, but it is a good approximation for modeling the onset of an epidemics. In absence of containment measures the epidemic threshold vanishes, so for every \u03bb > 0 the epidemic spreads exponentially fast.",

In particular we assume that the effective infectivity \u03bbF (\u03c4 ) of an infected individual decays with the time \u03c4 that has elapsed after the individual got infected. Depending on the functional form of the temporal kernel F (\u03c4 ) we investigate the critical properties of the epidemic spreading process. In particular we characterize the epidemic threshold of the model with containment measures and the asymptotic scaling of the number n(t) of infected individuals with time t. We therefore characterize when the containment measures are effective in pushing the dynamics in the subcritical regime, with \u03bb < \u03bb c . Additionally we show that in the subcritical regime the total number N (t) of infected individuals is constant asymptotically in time indicating that the spread of the epidemics has been halted. In the critical regime it is possible to observe a polynomial growth of N (t) in a given epidemic focus. When the containment measures are too mild to achieve the halting of the epidemics, i.e. \u03bb > \u03bb c , we quantify the impact of the adopted measures in reducing the rate of the exponential growth.",

This result can shed light on the observation that the data about COVID-19 cases in China seem to indicate a power-law growth instead of an exponential growth of the number of cases with time [7] , without requiring considerations based on the network topology [45] . Our understanding of this observation is that the Chinese data where just at the critical state of a multi-foci dynamics. This understanding of the dynamics seem to be confirmed by the fact that the epidemic spread appears to be successfully halted in China few weeks after the reported power-law dynamics, while in all the other countries where the epidemics continues to spread the grow of the number of cases is exponential.",

We demonstrated that different containment measures can either lead to a slowing down of the exponential spread by modulating the rate \u00b5 of the exponential growth of new case, or can bring the epidemic to an halt when they push the dynamics in the subcritical regime. In particular, exponential and generalized exponential temporal kernels always induce a finite epidemic threshold \u03bb c , so they are able to stop epidemics provided that \u03bb < \u03bb c . For power-law temporal kernels, the effective infectivity is able to induce a non-vanishing epidemic threshold only if they are steep enough, viz. if the power-law exponent \u03b1 determining their decay exceeds unity: \u03b1 > 1. For different temporal kernels of the infectivity, in the supercritical regime, \u03bb > \u03bb c , the total number of infected individuals grows exponentially fast; in the subcritical regime, i.e. below the epidemic threshold, the total number of infected individuals saturates to a constant; in the critical regime, the number of infected individuals grows in time linearly or sub-linearly.

Proceed-ing, one finds that n(t) seemingly decays faster than any power of time. Recall, that for the power-law kernel the decay of n(t) in the subcritical regime is qualitatively the same as the decay of the kernel F (\u03c4 ). This may occur also for the generalized exponential kernel, and our simulation results agree with this conjecture. Theoretically, however, we only established that the decay of n(t) is faster than any power law.",

            "text": "In this Appendix we derive the announced asymptotic behaviors (53) of the number of new infected individual n(t) in the critical regime for the power-law kernel . We also derive the predictions (54) for the amplitude, and additionally compute the sub-leading term in the special case of \u03b1 = 2 when the convergence to the leading asymptotic is anomalously slow.Our starting point is Eq. (32) that we rewrite asWe keep in mind known relations \u03bb = \u03bb c = 1/\u03b6(\u03b1) characterizing the critical regime of the power-law kernel in the \u03b1 > 1 range. To establish Eq. (53) we expand the right-hand side of Eq. (A1) in the region x \u2192 1 \u2212 ; the asymptotic behavior of n(t) follows from this expansion. The polylogarithmic function Li \u03b1 (x) exhibits different asymptotic behaviors in the x \u2192 1 \u2212 limit depending on whether different values of \u03b1 is smaller or larger than 2. Therefore we separately treat the cases of 1 < \u03b1 < 2, \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b1 > 2.In this range, the polylogarithmic function Li \u03b1 (x) admits the asymptotic expansion (47) which we insert into Eq. (A1) and arrive atwhich implies the large time behaviorstated in Eqs. (53)-(54) when 1 < \u03b1 < 2. Using the Euler identity \u0393(y)\u0393(1 \u2212 y) = \u03c0/ sin(\u03c0y), one can also re-write (A4) asA simple 'physical' confirmation of Eq. (A4) is obtained by substituting Eq.(A4) into the sum in the lefthand side of Eq. (A2), noting that in the x \u2192 1 \u2212 limit the summation can be replaced by integration, computing the integral and recovering the right-hand side of (A2). A rigorous derivation of the asymptotic of the coefficients from the singular behavior of the generating function can be done by a variety of techniques, e.g. by using Tauberian theorems [46] or complex analysis [47] ; see the textbook [48] for numerous examples. The polylogarithmic function Li 2 (x) has the asymptotic expansion (49) which we insert into Eq. (A1) and obtainfrom which we deduce the leading asymptotic behavior reported in Eqs. (53)-(54) at \u03b1 = 2. The presence of logarithms often implies that the sub-leading term is just logarithmically smaller than the leading term, and then the sub-sub-leading term is another logarithmic factor smaller. The derivation of these sub-leading terms is a bit long, but it uses standard techniques [47, 48] ; alternatively, it can be also extracted from the general results presented in [48] . Keeping just the leading and sub-leading terms yields the following asymptoticwhere \u03b3 E is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and we have dropped the terms of the order (ln t) \u22123 . Using Eq. (A7) we obtain a slightly more precise version of Eq. (55) at \u03b1 = 2:When \u03b1 > 2, the polylogairthmic function Li \u03b1 (x) admits the asymptotic expansion (51) which we insert into (A1) and getimplying that the number n(t) of new infected individuals saturates, In this Appendix we derive the announced asymptotic behavior (57) of the number of new infected individuals n(t) for the power-law kernel in the subcritical regime. We start with Eq. (32) that we rewrite here for convenience.The sub-critical regime \u03bb < \u03bb c = 1/\u03b6(\u03b1) is possible for all \u03b1 > 1. Since N(1) is finite, we consider the expansion of N(1) \u2212 N(x) in the x \u2192 1 \u2212 limit. By using Eq. (B1) it is possible to get the asymptotic expression of n(t) as long as 1 < \u03b1 \u2264 2. In the following paragraph we will show in detail how this expansion can be carried out for 1 < \u03b1 < 2, and \u03b1 = 2 and how in these cases we recover the asymptotic scaling in Eq. (57). Moreover we will show how the same method in the case \u03b1 > 2 provides only a bound to the scaling of n(t).1. Case 1 < \u03b1 < 2In the 1 < \u03b1 < 2 range, the deviation of Li \u03b1 (x) from Li \u03b1 (1) = \u03b6(\u03b1) scales aswhen x \u2192 1 \u2212 . This is just the re-writing of Eq. (47). Using Eqs. (B1) and (B2) we findRecalling the definition of the generating function N(x), we get t\u22650Differentiating with respect to x to obtain t\u22650 t n(t)leading to the announced asymptotic behavior (57) in the 1 < \u03b1 < 2 range.",
