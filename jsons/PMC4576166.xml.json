With approval from the University Malaya Medical Centre Medical Ethics Committee, a total of 3935 consenting outpatients who presented with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections were recruited at the Primary Care Clinics at the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between March 2012 and May 2014. Respiratory specimens in the form of nasopharyngeal swabs were collected daily. Symptom types and severity were assessed based on criteria described previously.7 Each symptom, namely sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, headache, sore throat, hoarseness of voice, muscle ache and cough, were graded as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. Total nucleic acids were extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG automated nucleic acid extraction system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy I'Etoile, France)8 as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The specimens were then screened for viral pathogens using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) FAST Assay (Abbott Molecular, Toronto, Canada) and analyzed using the Luminex's proprietary Universal Tag sorting system on the Luminex 200 IS platform (Luminex Corp., Austin, Texas, USA)9 The respiratory virus panel includes influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1), parainfluenza viruses (type 1\u20134), human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, adenovirus, human rhinovirus, and enteroviruses. Correlation of EV-D68 infections with meteorological parameters such as ground temperature (\u00b0C), relative humidity (%), number of rain days, and the amount of rainfall (mm) collected from the nearest meteorological station (latitude: 3\u00b006\u2032N, longitude: 101\u00b039\u2032E) was analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Specimens positive for enteroviruses were further confirmed using standard molecular approaches that involved amplification and sequencing of the human enterovirus VP4/VP2 gene using primers described previously.10 PCR amplification of the capsid (P1) region (2480 bp) of EV-D68 was performed when VP4/VP2 gene was identified as EV-D68. A combination of previously published primers, namely 9895-forward, 9565-reverse,10 5\u2032fwd1, 5\u2032rev1, 5\u2032fwd2, 5\u2032rev2,11 and newly designed primers were used to amplify the P1 region by forming several overlapping fragments. These newly designed primers are EV68P1.5F1 (5\u2032-TCA AAA TTY ACT GAA CCA GT-3\u2032), EV68P1.5R1 (5\u2032-GTT GCC ATG AAG CTV CCA CA-3\u2032), EV68P1.5R2 (5\u2032-GAT ATG TTT CCT ACT ARA GT-3\u2032), EV68P1.3F1 (5\u2032-CCA GGG CAR GTC CGY AAC ATG-3\u2032), EV68P1.3R1 (5\u2032-CCA YTT GWA AAA GTT YTT GTC-3\u2032), EV68P1.3F2 (5\u2032-GTG GAR TCA ATG GAG AT-3\u2032), and EV68P1.3R2 (5\u2032-GCT GAT TTA TCA CYG TGC GAG-3\u2032). A total of 128 VP4/VP2, 376 VP1, and 20 P1 of EV-D68 retrieved from GenBank (accessed on 26 February 2015) were analyzed using neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA version 6 to deduce the viral phylogenies.12 The statistical robustness of the branching orders was evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates.",

No EV-D68 cases were detected in other months, suggesting transient outbreaks of EV-D68. The 12 patients (five males and seven females) from whom EV-D68 was detected ranged in age from 29 to 78 years old.

            "text": "Based on previously described EV-D68 classification,11 the newly sequenced strains from Malaysia were found within clade A (MY-Cluster-1) and clade B (MY-Cluster-2). Phylogenetic analysis of the P1 region indicated that 91.7% (11/12) of the Malaysian EV-D68 formed clusters, suggesting the transient EV-D68 outbreaks were most likely caused by at least two viral lineages (Figure 1). A sporadic EV-D68 strain (12MYKL1236) that did not cluster with the major lineages was also observed. Of note, MY-Cluster-1 contains EV-D68 mostly sampled in 2012, while MY-Cluster-2 contains EV-D68 sampled in 2013/2014. Such observation suggests an ongoing \u201cclade shift\u201d or lineage replacement of circulating EV-D68 in causing new outbreak, as observed in other enterovirus-associated outbreaks.13 Sequence homology comparison based on the P1 region indicated that the Malaysian EV-D68 strains shared 86.6%\u201387.6% (nucleotide) and 93.4%\u201393.9% (amino acid) sequence identities with the Fermon strain (AY426531), a prototype strain isolated in the USA in 1962. Phylogenetic tree also showed that the representative EV-D68 sequences sampled from recent outbreaks in the USA were grouped into three distinct lineages. These lineages are designated as outbreak lineage 1 (consists of sequences isolated from Missouri, MO), lineage 2 (Illinois, IL and Kentucky, KY), and lineage 3 (KY) (Figure 1). Interestingly, Malaysian EV-D68 sequences (MY-Cluster-2) was related to outbreak lineage 1 while outbreak lineage 3 (US/KY/14-18953) was clustered with the MY-Cluster-1, supported by strong statistical evidence (bootstrap values of 97% and 100%, respectively) at the internal tree nodes and genetic distance of \u22640.015. Likewise, outbreak lineage 1 was closely related to the EV-D68 sequences (CU134 and CU171) reported recently in Thailand. All members of MY-Cluster-2 and outbreak lineage 1 exhibited unique amino acid substitution at two residue positions (S647A and T650A), while members of MY-Cluster-1 and outbreak lineage 3 sequences displayed unique amino acid substitutions at four residue positions (N554E, G558E, F655Y, and I739V) relative to the Fermon strain (Figure 1). These \u201cclade-defining\u201d substitutions differentiate outbreak lineage 3 from other outbreak and non-outbreak lineages. A unique substitution T650A discriminated outbreak lineage 1 from outbreak lineage 2, further suggesting that the former is indeed closely related to the Thai strains.5 Contribution of these amino acid substitutions on virus pathogenesis however remains unclear. Although the amino acid substitutions are located in the putative immunogenic BC and DE loops, experiments in susceptible cell systems are needed to prove the importance of such substitutions.14",

Divergence time at the internal tree nodes was estimated using the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software. Amino acid alignment of the P1 region indicates that the MY-Cluster-2 and outbreak lineage 1 exhibited unique substitutions at S647A and T650A while MY-Cluster-1 and US outbreak strain (US/KY/14-18953) displayed unique substitutions at four amino acid residue positions (N554E, G558E, F655Y, and I739V) relative to the prototype Fermon strain.",
