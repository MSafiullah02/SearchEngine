The attack rate was highest in the same bay (65%), slightly lower in the adjacent bay (52%), and much lower in the distant bays (18%), suggesting the possibility of a nonlinear relationship between concentration of virus and risk of infection.

Movements of the index case patient around the ward could have spread the infection to the other bays through direct contacts or droplets, but he was very ill during his first week of hospitalization and was bed-bound in the same bed [8]. Some inpatients in the ward were ambulatory, but it was most unlikely that many inpatients visited the index case patient and contracted the disease directly from him. They could also have acquired the infection in common areas that had been contaminated, such as the toilets, but because inpatients in the different bays were not particularly bed-bound or ambulatory, their probability of contracting the infection should not differ. We checked the bed movements (transfers) of the inpatients during the study period and found that none of the inpatients with SARS were moved to other beds after the onset of fever and, thus, could not have played a role in the spread of the infection to other bays.",

A similar pattern of nosocomial infection has been reported for vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile, and contaminated hands of HCWs were believed to be responsible for the contact spread [12, 13]. However, nursing duties in our ward were assigned by function and not by patient groups or geographical areas in the ward, as commonly practiced in other places. Our interviews confirmed that all nurses serving in the ward cared for inpatients in all 4 bays during each shift. All physicians in the ward also had to visit different inpatients in all 4 bays. The HCWs could potentially spread the virus to other inpatients through their unwashed hands after making contacts with the index case. Because every nurse had a chance of contacting different inpatients in the different bays, the risk of infection should be distributed more evenly among the different bays. It was still possible that some HCWs washed hands between servicing the next bay but did not wash hands between inpatients in the same bay. This would contribute substantially to within-bay spread but could not explain the relatively high attack rate in the adjacent bay.",

Clinical details of the index case have been described in 2 earlier reports [8, 15]. The release of a large amount of virus into the air by the index case patient through coughing around 6 March probably caused the first wave of infections, which mainly affected inpatients staying in the same and adjacent bays. Spread by direct contacts and droplets could explain only a small number of the infections, because droplet spread is believed to be effective only within a distance of \u223c1 m.

There was much overlapping of the dates of onset of fever for all groups, including the inpatients (figure 2), suggesting that the infections likely came from a common source, at least in the first phase up to 12 March. Unfortunately, proper spatial analysis of SARS among the non-inpatient groups was not possible. All HCWs visited and worked in all bays during their routine work in the ward, and all but 1 had direct contacts with the index case patient. We did not have a register to provide reliable denominator data for calculating the attack rates in the different locations for visitors. However, quite a number of the infected visitors only visited inpatients staying in the adjacent bay and did not get anywhere near the index case patient. A substantial number of infected visitors experienced onset of fever earlier than did the inpatients' relatives who they visited and, thus, could not have contracted the infection from them. This offers additional indirect support for a possible airborne spread of the virus from the index case patient.",

The analysis of SARS among medical students suggested that the index case patient became less infectious on 7 March [8]. Although it was possible that he became more infectious again around 10 March, this was not very likely, because his fever and chest condition gradually improved starting on 9 March [15]; other explanations should be considered. We have discussed above that bed movements of inpatients were unlikely to be responsible for the spread. We noted that a number of HCWs infected with SARS during the earlier phase of the outbreak developed fever and other symptoms on 8 and 9 March but continued working in the ward until 10 March. One or several of them most likely spread their infections to other inpatients through direct contacts or droplets and caused the second wave of the outbreak.",

Unlike other reports of airborne outbreaks, we were unable to document the existence of the infective agent in aerosols. Such documentation was simply impossible in early March 2003, when the infective agent was yet to be identified. SARS was unlikely a communicable disease with obligate airborne transmission, such as tuberculosis, but there was evidence to suggest that SARS could have at least opportunistic airborne transmission under special circumstances when virus-laden aerosols could be generated [16]. The virus-laden aerosols could come from the nebulizer [17] or the nuclei resulting from the rapid evaporation of the droplets produced by coughing in a relatively dry, air-conditioned environment. The use of the nebulizer appeared not to be essential for the outbreak, because medical students who were present in the ward only before the use of the nebulizer also became infected [8]. Infected HCWs who continued to work after the onset of symptoms were most likely responsible for propagating the infection in the later phase of the outbreak.",
