As the authors stated, the presence of two radiology technologists (RTs) represents the best solution for the CT scanning of COVID-19 patients: one RT with PPE sets up the patient positioning on the scanner table, whereas a second one, without PPE, operates the machine console. In the case of non-enhanced CT, a RT alone, wearing PPE, comes into contact with the patient; if patients do not cooperate, the RT will make use of the support of the healthcare assistant (HA) carrying the patient, already protected with PPE. In the case of contrast-enhanced CT, the medical radiologist wears PPE for direct assistance to the patient and to inject the contrast medium.",

In this time, a specifically trained HA, protected with PPE, removes the disposable sheet and cleans contact surfaces with a cloth soaked with alcohol-based disinfectants. The dedicated HA staff, on duty throughout the day, is also committed to assisting in dressing healthcare workers with PPE.",
