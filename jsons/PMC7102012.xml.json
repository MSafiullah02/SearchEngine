Elective surgery should be preceded by thorough patient evaluation and medical optimization via an interdisciplinary approach. Detailed conversations about surgical morbidity and mortality must occur between patient and surgeon to allow for appropriate surgical decision-making. Postoperative care must focus on patient recovery and close observation for liver decompensation. In the emergent setting, surgery on the cirrhotic patient carries a high mortality rate indicating a need for careful yet aggressive resuscitation and monitoring.",

The common disease pathway involves injury to and necrosis of hepatocytes leading to fibrosis of liver parenchyma resulting in loss of liver function. The exact mechanisms at the cellular level are not entirely understood leading to continued studies with an aim to clarify pathogenesis and improve therapeutic options.1 The liver is a vital organ playing a role in protein synthesis, metabolism of drugs and nutrients, detoxification, and portal venous blood filtering. Any hepatic dysfunction can lead to alterations in these processes. Pathophysiologically, cirrhosis results in a hyperdynamic state including increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance.2 Baseline portal blood flow is reduced due to portal hypertension, and diminished autoregulation can also result in decreased hepatic arterial blood flow. It has also been suggested that arteriovenous shunting and decreased splanchnic blood flow change overall systemic circulation in the setting of cirrhosis. Splanchnic vasodilation causes effective hypovolemia, driving sodium and water retention mediated by the renin-angiotensin system.3 Activation of the renin-angiotensin system causes renal vasoconstriction, making patients susceptible to kidney injury.3 Due to these physiologic alterations, the cirrhotic liver is far more vulnerable to hypotension or hypoxemia which can both occur in the operative setting.4",

A summary of recommendations for specific procedures is presented below:Emergent abdominal laparotomy: Mortality in cirrhotics increases with MELD > 16 or ISS > 16. Consider non-operative or minimally invasive alternatives, if available.Elective AAA repair: Mortality appears to increase with MELD scores > 10.Biliary surgery: Laparoscopic approaches are preferable to open, though cirrhotics have a higher rate of conversion than normal controls. The highest mortality rates are seen in Child C, though mortalities have been reported after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for Child A and B patients.Foregut surgery: Both bariatric procedures and gastrectomy have been successfully performed in Child A patients.Colorectal surgery: While cirrhotics have a higher mortality for both laparoscopic and open procedures compared to matched controls, the risk is acceptable in patients with MELD < 15.Abdominal hernia repair: Non-operative management has poor success rates in this population, and elective procedures can be safely performed in MELD < 15.",
