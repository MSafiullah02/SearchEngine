The attack rate is highest between the ages of 3 and 8 months; 66% of cases occur in children younger than 5 years of age. Bacterial meningitis is seen during all seasons; however, there may be a seasonal correlation between the presence of preceding respiratory pathogens (viral, mycoplasmal) in the upper respiratory tract and the subsequent development of bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis usually occurs sporadically. Clusters of cases have been noted in day care centers and other closed communities. Bacterial meningitis occurs more frequently in children with traumatic fractures of the cribriform plate or paranasal sinuses (pneumococci); in children who have undergone neurosurgical procedures (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium species); in children with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies (pneumococci, Listeria monocytogenes, meningococci); in children with anatomic or functional asplenia (pneumococci, meningococci) ; and in children with sickle hemoglobinopathies (pneumococci).

A decision whether to treat a child for bacterial meningitis should not be based on the Gram stain alone; the definitive diagnosis is based on the CSF culture. Rapid diagnostic tests for bacterial antigens in CSF, including countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and latex particle agglutination, suffer from variations in sensitivity and specificity that limit their value in clinical practice. Some patients will have been treated with antibiotics before the lumbar puncture is performed.
