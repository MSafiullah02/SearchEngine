Coronaviruses are found in a variety of animals and humans.\nHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the genus\nAlphacoronavirus, and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the A lineage (subgenus\nEmbecovirus) of genus Betacoronavirus. HCoVs were first\nisolated in cell culture in the 1960s from persons with upper respiratory infections. These\nwere later characterized as HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 [1]. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in the early 2000s from persons with\nbronchiolitis and pneumonia. In 2002 a Betacoronavirus in lineage B\n(subgenus Sarbecovirus) originating in bats, then spread from civets to\nhumans in the Guangdong province of southern China, causing severe respiratory disease, and\ntaking the name severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2,3]. In\n2012 a Betacoronavirus in lineage C (subgenus\nMerbecovirus) spread from camels to humans in Saudi Arabia, causing a\nsimilar clinical syndrome as SARS, taking the name Middle East respiratory syndrome-related\ncoronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4\u20136].",

In temperate regions endemic HCoVs usually display a winter\nseasonality, although HCoV-229E has been detected sporadically throughout the year [12]. Endemic HCoVs are globally distributed and are\nmaintained in the human population. The SARS-CoV pandemic came to an end in 2003\n(https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/CDS_CSR_ARO_2004_2.pdf?ua=1.\nAccessed 3 February 2020), less than a year after the first reported case. In contrast,\nhuman cases caused by MERS-CoV continue to be reported at the time of writing, more than\nseven years after the first reported case. Most laboratory-confirmed MERS cases have\noccurred in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the majority of those in Saudi Arabia.\nUnlike the endemic HCoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are maintained in zoonotic reservoirs. The\nSARS and MERS outbreaks were driven in part by super-spreading events in which individuals\ndirectly infected a disproportionally large number of contacts [13]. The SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nepidemic originated in a Wuhan, China market that sold exotic animals for consumption.\nBased on genetic relatedness to other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 likely has a zoonotic\nreservoir. However, the precise source of SARS-CoV-2 that initially infected humans\nremains to be confirmed. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be substantially more contagious than\nSARS-CoV (Table 1). The distribution of\nSARS-CoV-2 in different mammalian species is unknown. An interesting question is the\nsusceptibility of farm animals and pets, and their role in the epidemiologic cycle as\ntheir angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor shares similarity with human ACE2\n[14].

The endemic HCoVs have been\ndetected from a variety of upper and lower respiratory sources including throat, nasal\nnasopharyngeal (NP), sputum, and bronchial fluid [12,23,24]. Wang et al have just reported that oropharyngeal (OP) swabs\n(n = 398) were used much more frequently than NP swabs\n(n = 8) in China during the COVID-19 outbreak; however, the SARS-CoV-2\nRNA was detected only in 32% of OP swabs, which was significantly lower than that in NP\nswabs (63%)[25]. The US centers for disease\ncontrol and prevention (CDC) recommends collecting the upper respiratory NP swab.\nCollection of an OP specimen is a lower priority, and, if collected, should be combined in\nthe same tube as the NP swab (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html.\nAccessed 16 March 2020). Swab specimens should be placed in a universal or viral transport\nmedium. Nasopharyngeal aspirates are also suitable specimens for the detection of\nHCoVs.",

However, the\ncollection of sputum and particularly BAL via bronchoscopy increases biosafety risk to\nhealthcare workers through the creation of aerosol droplets. Proper use of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers is important. Bronchoscopy is a highly\ntechnical procedure requiring well-trained staff and may not be available in many parts of\nthe world. Upper respiratory specimens are easy to collect, thereby increasing access to\ntesting for patients with mild symptoms, and in the resource limited settings. SARS-CoV\nand MERS-CoV RNA are also detected from stool, urine and blood specimens, although\ngenerally less reliably than from respiratory specimens [26\u201328]. An exception is SARS-CoV\nRNA which is consistently detected in feces at about two weeks after symptom onset [26,29].\nFor the most sensitive detection of endemic HCoVs, upper respiratory specimens should be\ncollected within the first few days of symptom onset. The dynamics of RNA shedding in MERS\nand SARS patients may reflect the specimen source, severity of illness, as well as\nunderlying risk factors. Among hospitalized patients who did not require ventilator\nsupport, MERS-CoV RNA levels in the upper respiratory tract usually peaked in the first\nweek after symptom onset. Among eventual fatal cases requiring ventilation, RNA levels in\nlower respiratory tract specimens peaked between weeks 2 and 3 [27]. Similar shedding patterns were seen for SARS-CoV: RNA\npositive rates peaked in upper respiratory tract specimens at 7\u201310 days after symptom\nonset and then steadily declined after that, while RNA positive rates in lower respiratory\ntract specimens remained higher throughout 3 weeks after onset of illness [26]. In one study, diabetes was associated with\nprolonged MERS-CoV RNA shedding in the respiratory tract [27].",

Some pan-CoV assays use degenerate primers [52], some utilize multiple primer sets [53], and others employ a single set of\nnondegenerate primers [54]. Current molecular\nrespiratory panels that detect the endemic HCoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and\nHCoV-229E) require multiple sets of PCR oligonucleotides [12,55\u201357]. SARS-CoV-2 cases tested negative for endemic HCoVs included in molecular\nrespiratory panels [10].",
