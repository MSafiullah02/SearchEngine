The incidence of the disease is generally high, with outbreaks reported in most parts of the world (Saif and Heckert, 1990). The peak of incidence occurs in the winter due to the heat sensitivity showed by BCoV (Saif and Heckert, 1990). Recently, severe outbreaks of winter disease have been reported also in the warmer season (Fukutomi et al., 1999, Park et al., 2006). In this study, an outbreak of enteric and respiratory disease associated with BCoV infection is reported which occurred in the warmer season in a dairy herd of southern Italy, causing a marked decrease in milk production.",

            "text": "The outbreak occurred in the first decade of September 2006 (mean seasonal temperature of 30 \u00b0C) in a dairy herd of Apulia region, Italy, that consisted of 80 Holstein cattle including 40 lactating cows, 20 heifers or dry cows, and 20 calves. The three groups were housed in separate paddocks, but the two facilities housing the cows and heifers were very closed. The herd had a daily milk production ranging between 800 and 900 l and was generally healthy apart from sporadic respiratory distress in 2\u20133-month-old calves. Vaccination against bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) was performed routinely using a modified-live virus administered at 6-month intervals. Two calves purchased from a local farm had been introduced about 20 days before the onset of clinical signs. One week before the appearance of the disease, the food administered to the lactating cows had been changed. The morning after the scheduled vaccination against BVDV, most lactating cows (25/40) displayed a severe, often bloody diarrhoea, fever (41\u201341.5 \u00b0C) and anorexia. Agalactia was also evident with a dramatic decrease in milk production (daily milk production below 70 l, with a 91\u201392% reduction of the baseline production). During the same day, all the lactating cows showed haemorrhagic diarrhoea and hyperthermia, whereas serous or catarrhal ocular and nasal discharges were observed in 27 cows within 48 h from the onset of clinical signs. After 72 h also the heifers and dry cows (20/20) were affected, displaying a temperature of 41\u201341.5 \u00b0C, severe diarrhoea that was haemorrhagic in few animals, ocular and nasal discharge. Simultaneously, mild cough and ocular/nasal discharge were observed in some calves (8/20), that underwent a progressive improvement of their conditions with full recover within 7\u20138 days. Gastroenteric and respiratory signs, together with anorexia and hypo/agalactia, persisted in lactating cows, many of which were lying down. The animals were treated with oxytetracycline (25 mg/kg of body weight) and a mild improvement of the clinical conditions in some animals was observed starting from day 7 after the onset of the disease, when gastroenteric signs became less severe, the rectal temperature regained normal values and the daily milk production increased up to 300\u2013400 l (33\u201357% of the baseline production). Respiratory distress (cough and nasal discharge) persisted in heifers. After 15 days from the onset of the disease, three cows and five heifers still presented diarrhoea and serous ocular discharge, respectively, whereas the daily milk production approached standard values. However, some cows, that were infected and displayed agalactia at the end of their lactation period, did not regain any milking activity.",

However, lactating cows were severely affected by haemorrhagic diarrhoea, respiratory distress and hypogalactia. Winter dysentery, the most severe clinical form of BCoV infection, occurs in adult cattle in the winter, due to predisposing events such as cold temperatures and drinking cold water (White et al., 1989). In the described outbreak, the lactating cows were affected by both enteric and respiratory signs during the warmer season. In fact, the first decade of September 2006 was particularly warm in our region (Apulia), with maximum temperatures reaching 34 \u00b0C, about 10 \u00b0C higher than the seasonal mean temperature registered 1 year before (http://www.meteo.it/). Other predisposing causes were investigated, including the presence of mycotoxins in feedstuff and the administration of a BVD modified-live vaccine. Since mycotoxins detected in the feedstuff were largely below the toxicity minimal levels, an essential role in triggering the severity of BCoV disease may be ascribed to BVD vaccination. However, any reversion to virulence of the vaccine virus could be ruled out as it was not detected in the samples collected from vaccinated animals, probably as consequence of strong immunity due to previous administrations of the vaccine. Therefore, it could be speculated that the vaccination action rather than the vaccine stressed the animals, thus leading to an increase in virulence of a BCoV strain. Such a strain may have circulated latently in the herd causing only mild respiratory signs in calves and the BVD vaccination may have represented the main factor triggering the onset of severe disease in heifers and adult cows. The appearance of clinical signs nearly simultaneously (in few hours) in all lactating cows reinforces the hypothesis of an increase in virulence of a BCoV strain already infecting the animals rather than of a rapid spread of the infection due to vaccine-driven immunosuppression. The high BCoV antibody titres detected by ELISA in the bovine sera during the acute phase of the disease provide further support to the former hypothesis.",

In the outbreak described in South Korea, the occurrence of winter dysentery in adult cows has been associated to continued exposure to BCoV due to high prevalence of BCoV infection in that country (Park et al., 2006). This hypothesis cannot be verified for the Italian outbreak since the real prevalence of BCoV infection in Italy is unknown due to the lack of published results. Unlike the previous reports, the Italian outbreak was characterised by the simultaneous occurrence of gastroenteritis and respiratory distress. Although both enteric and respiratory signs were observed in the same animals, no obvious genetic differences were detected in the HE and S genes between strains isolated from the faeces and those isolated from the respiratory tract. This finding is in agreement with recent observations that BCoV strains currently circulating possess both enteric and respiratory tropisms (Jeong et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006), whereas other authors had found genetic markers distinguishing respiratory from enteric strains circulating in the previuos years (Chouljenko et al., 2001, Gelinas et al., 2001a, Gelinas et al., 2001b, Hasoksuz et al., 2002). Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that recent BCoVs may be diverging over the time from an enteric tropism to a dual respiratory and enteric tropism (Jeong et al., 2005).",
