Some of the earliest studies also indicated that there were general patterns of succession which influenced how communities form and are altered via invasion of new members or destabilization (e.g., by antibiotics) [4, 5] . We now know that the microbiota contributes to nutrient production and acquisition, as well as resistance to colonization by pathogens. Interestingly studies in germ-free mice have demonstrated that the microbiota is required for normal physiological development of the organs such as the gut, lung, and brain [6] . The gut microbiota drives the development of the mucosal immune system, including the initiation of secretion of immunoglobulins [7] , the development of T-cell populations [8, 9] , and stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides [10] .

From early infancy, the URT is colonized by several pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. These and other bacteria can also be referred to as 'pathobionts', which generally colonize the host asymptomatically, but have the potential to cause disease if they spread from the site of colonization [11] . In fact, some pathobionts such as the Streptococcus anginosus group are believed to be the major cause of complicated lung infections such as pleural empyema [12, 13] . The composition of the URT microbiota, including the presence of pathogens, changes rapidly during infancy, the process of which is called ecological succession. Ecological succession describes changes within the microbial community over time, which is influenced by both changing habitats (e.g., the developing human tissue) and exposure to new community members (i.e., colonizing bacteria). The progression of the URT microbiota has been shown to impact airway disease later in childhood [14] . Understanding how microbial succession and colonization increases or reduces susceptibility to respiratory diseases such as asthma and allergy and how it promotes or prevents invasion by pathogens may inform novel interventions.

These different compartments allow for colonization of pathogens, as differences in temperature, mucus secretion, and relative oxygen concentration throughout the URT may regulate colonization, as it does in the gastrointestinal tract [16, 17] . The vestibules contain stratified squamous epithelial cells that transition into pseudostratified epithelial cells, as well as hairs that are important for trapping large particulate matter [15] . Inspired air is heated and humidified within the turbinates of the nasal cavity, which also dehumidifies expired air. The nasal cavity has three turbinates that increase the surface area of the nose, and heat airflow entering the nasopharynx [18]. Glands and goblet cells are important for secreting the hydrated mucus layer, which contributes to humidifying incoming air and traps microparticles and microbes entering the URT from the environment. Finally, the humidified air enters the nasopharynx, which moves into the lungs for respiration within the alveolar space. Ciliated epithelial cells direct mucus flow toward the esophagus to remove trapped particles, which is known as mucociliary clearance [19] . Thus, the URT protects the lower airways from temperature or particle-induced cellular damage. Air inspired into the URT impacts the inner ear since the Eustachian tubes contain air that is required for equalization of air pressure near the eardrum. Infections of the Eustachian tubes, known as acute or chronic otitis media, occur when pathogens evade physiological and immunological barriers of the URT [20,21].

In this study, 141 taxa, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium species were found in four different sites in 34 surgical patients. The majority of species were found in all regions of the nose, except Corynebacterium simulans, which was not present in the posterior vestibule, and Acinetobacter lwoffii, which was not present in the anterior vestibule and inferior meatus. There were distinct pairs of species that were generally cultured together.

This suggests that these pairs have a mutualistic relationship that may promote colonization or facilitate survival within the URT. Although this study provided the most extensive culture-based dataset on the composition of the URT microbiome, next-generation sequencing on a subset of samples, identified 113 bacterial phylotypes that were not recovered by culture. This highlighted that the extensive culturing methods used did not identify all the bacteria as they were able to detect more bacterial groups via next-generation sequencing [44] .

This gene has nine variable regions (V1-V9), differences in which allow for taxonomic identification of bacteria, which are classified as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs [45] . In general, targeting one or more of these variable regions is sufficient to identify members of the microbiota at the genus level, however, the specific 16S variable regions used may vary due to tissue type or particular bacterial families present [46] . While OTUs help quantitate the overall diversity of the microbiota, identification beyond the genera level can pose a significant challenge for determining exact community composition of the URT. As an example, the URT microbiota contains many members of the genus Streptococcus [47] . The high degree of 16S sequence similarity between this genus means that it is not possible to resolve the relative abundances of members of these genera [48, 49] . Nonetheless, culture-independent techniques have been extremely useful in characterizing the composition and diversity of the URT microbiota. Sequencing of swabs of the middle turbinate, nasopharynx or anterior nares for nasal microbiota, and tongue or buccal mucosa for oral cavity sampling have identified that Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae dominate in nasal cavity of healthy adults, although there is considerable compositional variability between the individuals [50]. The oral cavity in these healthy adults was dominated by Streptococcaceae and Veillonellaceae. The microbial communities from the three sampling sites were distinct from each other, signifying important local niches for colonization.

As an example, Shannon diversity increases in elderly patients suffering from pneumonia compared to healthy elderly people [63] . The Shannon diversity Index is a metric which accounts for the abundance of different bacteria, with a low Shannon diversity suggesting the microbiota is dominated by a few bacterial species, whereas a high Shannon diversity suggests many different taxa of even relative abundance [71] .
