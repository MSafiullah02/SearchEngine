More precisely we ask the question of how the epidemic outcomes are affected if the initial infection does not provide immunity but rather sensitization to future challenges. We first provide background comparison with the 2003 SARS epidemic. Then we use a compartmental epidemic model structured by immunity level (taken here as age classes) that we fit on available data; this allows to derive quantitative insights into the future number of severe cases and deaths.",

In particular many perplexing questions have not yet found adequate answers, that would be crucial for the design of optimal treatment policies and healthcare strategies, both at the individual and societal level. Among these questions, prominent ones are: Why are the mortality patterns so skewed toward higher ages? What is the common denominator of the observed comorbidities that affect in a non-negligible way the outcome of the disease? What is the size of the asymptomatic cohorts? Are asymptomatic (or paucisymptomatic) cases a barrier or an accelerator of the disease propagation? etc. To these salient questions, which deal with the present situation, we should add questions relative to future outbreaks, their severity and characteristics. This is particularly important as health authorities have, for obvious reasons, focused on the design of vaccines, despite the fact that vaccines are sometimes extremely difficult to obtain [17] . In particular while a response to previous infections is usually protective it can sometimes be deleterious and result in severe outcomes (see e.g. [16] ). Answering many of these questions requires deep understanding of the immune response of the host, whether innate or acquired, at the cellular or humoral level. Recent research pointed out that it is critical to investigate previous history of interaction between host and infective virus strains [1] . In this context, the question of whether previous infection with coronaviruses is beneficial or detrimental to the immunity of the host is a matter of active debate, see for instance [2, 21, 22] .",

This is even already documented in the case of COVID-19 as the similarity with dengue fever has resulted in false-positive identification when using diagnostic tests based on serology (see for example in Singapore [26] ). Let us illustrate the first two situations more in detail: for dengue fever it is established that a previous infection with a virus belonging to a particular serotype family can cause adverse reaction upon re-infection with a virus from another serotype (see [11] ). This unwanted outcome was demonstrated in a study that monitored two dengue fever outbreaks: a first one in Cuba in 1977 [9] , followed by a second one twenty years later (1997) [12] . Being infected during the first epidemic was proven to negatively influence the outcome of patients infected in the 1997 epidemic (with a dengue fever serotype that differed from that of 1997). To put this otherwise, the acquired immune response was fit for a given serotype but detrimental upon challenge with a different serotype. In the present context, the large time lapse between the two dates is worth emphasizing. Irrespective of whether or not the challenge is or is not related to a different serotype, we will call this situation a \"Cuban hypothesis\" and discuss it below.",

To these we must add the now well-known strains SARS-CoV-1 (responsible for the 2003 epidemic), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. If a \"Cuban hypothesis\" is found to account for the persistent development of related diseases, the challenge by any one of these viruses or novel variants may reach human populations in a variety of forms. This dire anticipation prompted us to investigate the impact of such a scenario on the immune system status within the population at large. In this context, we address here the following questions: In the absence of any relevant serological information, we compared age-dependent case fatality ratios of the SARS 2003 and COVID-19. More precisely, using data from [15] (see [4, 13] for additional data) we computed the age-dependent death rate for all 1755 SARS 2003 patients in Hong Kong. The benefit of using this database is that is contains information on all patients and therefore has no representation bias. For COVID-19 such data is not yet available so we use the Institut National d'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques (INED) database [7] at the date of May 4th 2020. The two bases do not allocate cases exactly to the same age groups, we grouped together the 5-year 2003 data to fit the 2020 INED 10year database ranges and on the other hand use uniform attribution for ages in the \"above 75\" 2003 HK class) to fill two corresponding classes \"70-79\" and \"80+\".",

Those patients are usually not detected and their estimation is statistically challenging. Even more difficult is to extrapolate the state of the immune system after a mild or severe infection and how this can be translated to future immune unbalanced response. Our hypothesis is the following: a coronavirus infection will sensitize all infected persons to future infections. To quantify such an additional sensitivity we can only use data from the severely infected classes and take death as the extreme case of severity, statistically, within the group as a whole. Thus, when we consider the severely infected persons this group experienced a deleterious alteration of their immune system, which is quantified by the intensity of the outcome (death). We calculated, using the data from Sant\u00e9 Publique France [20, obtained as r c = 70/(70 + 922) = 7, 05%. We subsequently compared this rate with the natural death rate of the French population which is r n = 0, 9%. Following this approach we concluded that it would take f c = log(1 + r c )/ log(1 + r n ) 7.6 years of natural evolution to match the unfavorable outcomes of the group (i.e., to observe the same death rate) as that experienced for severe COVID-19 patients. As coronavirus infection is the cause of this outcome, we extrapolated the outcome assuming that each COVID-19 patient \"lost\" 7.6 years of immune function quality in what coronavirus adequate response is concerned (this is not to be related to chronological or biological age). On the other hand, if we compare with the data from the E-CDC [6] concerning the whole set of COVID-19 patients the rate r c becomes 25987/137779 = 18.86% and f c = 19, 28 years. We see that there is a large uncertainty arising from the way we count the cases. This is not specific to the situation we try to model but a very general difficulty in similar situations. To simplify, we considered that patients who had a first infection with SARS-CoV-2 will experience an alteration of their immune function (relative to coronavirus infections or related medical conditions) and that their immunity parameters will be similar to those of a patient in the next immunity class. In the model (1)-(7) this means that a patient that ends up in R k or R M k will start the next epidemic as if being virtually in the group S k+1 (which means having d k+1 and f k+1 parameters), even if his biological age is still be counted with those in the class S k . Note that this assumption does not imply that the patients that had a mild form of COVID will experience the next time a severe form (there are still mild forms starting in S k ) but only that the parameters f k , d k will change.",

All curves share a common shape: a constant null range followed by a marked (exponential) increase starting in the \"30-39\" age group for the 2003 data and \"50-59\" group for all countries in 2020. This 20 years shift at the onset of the exponential regime can be interpreted as resulting from the existence of a common cause (situated approximately 30-40 years before 2003 and 50-59 years before 2020, that is, between 1960 and 1970) that affected all people living at that date and which could explain why there are, 30 (respectively 50) years later, affected by the coronavirus outbreaks in a more severe way. Since the cause occurred before 1970 people born after this date will have no fragility, which is precisely what is seen in the plot. We interpret this as an evidence that previous infection history can negatively impact the individual outcome of a future infection. Note that historically the 1960-70 decade is rich in epidemic / virus related events: the Hong Kong flu of 1968-1969 (that killed an estimated 1 million people worldwide) but also the start of the identification of the four endemic human coronaviruses (mid-1960s). Note that such a conclusion is consistent with recent investigations, see [10] that showed that individuals are prone to repeated infection with coronaviruses, with the unfortunate consequence that not only the immunity may vanish (sometimes within a year) but that the re-infection can be more severe. Data displayes in the figure 2 substantiates the same conclusion.",

The results are plotted in figures 3, 4 and 5. The mean death age goes down from 79.13 to 76.15 and the total number of deaths goes from 16705 up to 20481 (+22.6%).
