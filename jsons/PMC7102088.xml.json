            "text": "The discovery of chemokines and their corresponding receptors on the surface of leukocytes, has paved the way for an understanding of the mechanisms by which immune system cells are recruited to an inflammatory site. Chemokines are a structurally related family of more than 50 small basic proteins which act on distinct subsets of leukocytes via specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and govern multiple aspects of host defense and inflammation, such as leukocyte trafficking, hematopoiesis, and angiogenesis.[1,2] The chemokine family can be conveniently divided into two major subsets by examination of their four conserved cysteine residues. The CXC or \u03b1 class have a single amino acid interspersed between the amino-terminal two cysteines and are mainly active on neutrophils and T-lymphocytes, whilst the CC or \u03b2 class has adjacent amino terminal cysteines and are active on monocytes, basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes but do not target neutrophils. Two minor subsets also exist, the CX3C and C chemokines, which possess only single members, namely fractalkine and lymphotactin.[3,4] Fractalkine contains three amino acids between the first amino-terminal two cysteines, whilst lymphotactin contain only two cysteines, corresponding to the first and third cysteines in the other three groups. All the chemokines share a common protein fold, the Greek key motif, composed of three anti-parallel \u03b2-pleated sheets overlaid by a carboxy terminal \u03b1 helix (figure 1).",

Whilst both receptors can bind IL-8 with high affinity, they are also receptors for other CXC chemokines. CXCR2 is relatively promiscuous and in addition to IL-8 can also bind the CXC chemokines growth-related oncogene-\u03b1, neutrophil activating peptide-2, epithelial cell-derived neutrophil activating peptide-78 and granulocyte chemotactic protein (GCP)-2 (figure 2). In contrast, CXCR1 binds only IL-8 and GCP-2.[32] CXCR1 and CXCR2 have also been reported to be present on the surface of microvascular endothelial cells[33] and activation of CXCR2 has been shown to induce cytoskeletal reorganization and retraction of endothelial cells which may contribute to the increased vascular permeability observed in acute inflammation.[34]",

Cross-linking of CD28 induces CXCR1 expression and increases migration of neutrophils in response to IL-8[36] whilst CD45 signaling down modulates both CXCR1 and CXCR2[37] suggesting a role for this co-stimulatory molecule in modulating IL-8 receptor expression.",

An initial link between neutrophils and the pathogenesis of asthma arose with the discovery by Atkins and colleagues[39] in 1977 of a neutrophil chemotactic activity present in the plasma and associated with an asthmatic reaction, following a ragweed-inhalation challenge of susceptible individuals. This activity was never completely purified, so its identity remains unknown. A later study of exercise-induced late asthmatic reactions resulted in the observation of enhanced neutrophil chemotactic activity, accompanied by reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) after treadmill exercise.[40] Following the identification of IL-8, and the development of suitable reagents, IL-8 was subsequently identified as an inflammatory factor implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. In support of this, IL-8 can be detected in the sera of patients with severe atopic asthma and the levels correlate with disease activity[41,42] raising the possibility of a role for the neutrophil in patients with severe persistent asthma. Since asthma that is characterized by non-eosinophilic airway inflammation is generally less responsive to corticosteroid treatment[43] it may be that treatment of such individuals with a regimen directed at the activity of IL-8 proves beneficial. The use of serum levels of IL-8 as a marker for asthma remains controversial as others have argued that it is a poor indicator of disease activity.[44]",

            "text": "IL-8 is expressed by both the bronchial epithelial cells[49] and the peripheral blood eosinophils of patients with asthma.[50] Although peripheral blood eosinophils express IL-8, it appears that these cells do not release IL-8 into the circulation, although they do release it into the lung.[51] The eosinophil granule protein, major basic protein (MBP), may serve to stimulate IL-8 production either in an autocrine or hormonal fashion, acting on the eosinophil itself[52] or the neutrophil.[53] Of interest are the findings that IL-8 does not induce chemotaxis of eosinophils from healthy volunteers, but is chemotactic for eosinophils purified from patients with either a blood eosinophilia,[54] birch pollen allergy[55] or patients with asthma who have undergone bronchoprovocation with a relevant allergen.[56] Collectively, the findings are suggestive of an eosinophilia-associated priming mechanism which may induce CXCR1/2 expression on eosinophils, although we showed that in normal and atopic donors, IL-8 was ineffective at inducing eosinophil shape change, which is generally thought to be a pre-requisite for chemotaxis.[57] Whilst some reports have found no CXCR1 or CXCR2 on eosinophils from normal volunteers either by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or flow cytometry,[58] we were able to show low levels of non-functional CXCR2 on eosinophils.[57] Additionally, Bonecchi et al.[59] recently showed that T helper 2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 could induce the expression of functional CXCR1 and CXCR2 on human monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, so although IL-8 has a principal role in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment, within the context of asthma it may also regulate the recruitment of other cell types. There is also an appreciation that the IL-8 signal might originate from multiple etiologies involved in acute and chronic asthma. For example, viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus can trigger asthma exacerbations and induce IL-8 generation.[60,61] Additionally, endotoxin, which is a component of environmental dust and a major stimulus of NF-\u03baB driven IL-8 generation, may regulate some of the responses perceived to be due to environmental allergen. Michel et al.[62] showed that asthma severity correlated better with endotoxin levels in house dust than with levels of house dust mite allergen.",

IL-8 has been detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay in lung tissue and in the circulation of patients with COPD[65,66] and elevated levels of IL-8 are observed in sputum obtained from patients with COPD during disease exacerbation.[67] The best use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD remains a subject of much debate.[68] In contrast to in vitro findings, a recent report suggests that in vivo, shortterm corticosteroid treatment does not reduce sputum levels of IL-8 in patients with chronic bronchitis.[69] Further clinical studies on the effects of corticosteroid on IL-8 production in COPD patients would be timely.",

[73\u201375] Suggestive of a role for IL-8 in the pathology of ARDS, is the reported correlation between the level of circulatory IL-8 and clinical outcome in ARDS patients.[76] In keeping with this, amelioration of lung injury in a rabbit model of lung ischemia/reperfusion injury was achieved using anti-IL-8,[77] andneutrophils have been shown to play a role in other animal models of lung injury. [78,79] Furthermore, a bronchoscopic study of patients at risk of developing ARDS found a significant correlation between IL-8 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the likelihood of subsequent disease.[72,80] A significant portion of IL-8 in lung fluids from patients with ARDS is associated with either anti-IL-8 auto-antibodies or \u03b12-macroglobulin which may act as a carrier, protecting it from proteolysis and thereby enhancing its activity. [81,82] Studies from the same group using a rabbit model of ARDS have shown that whilst IL-8 complexed with \u03b12-macroglobulin retained chemotactic activity in vitro, its ability to induce an influx of neutrophils into the rabbit lung in vivo was impaired.[83] Thus, conjugation of IL-8 in vitro may afford a clearance mechanism to remove IL-8 from the inflamed lung.",

This pursuit is facilitated considerably by the vast library of compounds that are already available to the pharmaceutical industry following years of GPCR study. Indeed, such compounds either, agonists or antagonists, provide a large proportion of drugs currently in use. For example, antagonists of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 adrenergic receptors are used in the treatment of angina, arrhythmias, and hypertension, \u03b2-agonists are a vital component in the management of asthma, whilst histamine H1 and H2 receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of allergic reactions and gastric ulceration. In terms of CXCR1/2 antagonism, progress has been hampered by the fact that although orthologues of IL-8 have been isolated from nine species, the gene appears to absent in the rat and mouse.[84] Similarly, whilst both CXCR1 and CXCR2 orthologues have been found in several species including the rat, no murine CXCR1 orthologue has been forthcoming, hindering the development of in vivo models.",

Whilst the majority of small antagonist programs have been blighted with the inability of compounds to cross the species barrier, thus preventing in vivo testing in relevant disease models, this is not the case with SB 225002. The compound is a potent inhibitor of IL-8 mediated rabbit neutrophil chemotaxis and in vivo in the same species, selectively blocks IL-8-induced neutrophil margination. It is feasible that such a CXCR2 antagonist could be developed to target the many actions of IL-8 and related chemokines acting upon CXCR2. However, such effects would have to be monitored carefully as neutrophils are essential for host defense against microbial pathogens, and undesired immunosuppression is surely the most worrying potential adverse effect of administration of these compounds to humans.",

These extensive studies have generated novel targets for the development of future therapeutic compounds. It is now clear that chemokines such as IL-8 play a fundamental role in regulating leukocyte trafficking in these diseases. Early studies with a CXCR2 specific antagonist provide the proof of principle that IL-8 receptors can be blocked both in vitro and in vivo with a low molecular weight antagonist. Clinical trials with this compound will provide the crucial information that will define whether or not IL-8 blockade will provide future therapy in pulmonary disease.",
