Opportunistic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during anaesthesia has shown the relative absence of inflammatory cells in children with viral wheeze in between episodes, in contrast to those with atopic asthma [2]. There are no published data on inflammation in the respiratory tract during episodes of viral wheeze, although other evidence suggests that respiratory tract inflammation is likely to be involved. This comes from studies of inflammation in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) in both healthy and asthmatic volunteers during \u2018wild\u2010type\u2019 [5, 6] and experimental infections, usually with human rhinovirus (HRV) [7, 8, 9, 10].",

In samples of nasal secretions, these soluble mediators include TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20108, IL\u20106, IFN\u2010\u03b3, GroA, and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) [9, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The LRT tract is also known to become inflamed during viral exacerbations of classical atopic asthma, two studies suggesting the recruitment of both neutrophils and eosinophils [5, 6]. In a study of acute severe asthma attacks, 50% of which were thought to be due to colds, high numbers of neutrophils, together with high concentrations of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108, were found in spontaneously expectorated sputum [5]. A second study of six classical asthmatics during colds found a more modest sputum neutrophilia, together with high levels of IL\u20108 and ECP, compared with convalescent values [6]. Sputum eosinophil differential counts were not elevated in the latter despite evidence of their activation by the release of ECP.",

Because of this and the problems of collecting invasive samples from young children during episodes of viral wheeze, we have established a model of EVW, employing an experimental infection using human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, in young adults with a history of wheeze only during viral URT infection (URTI) [4]. HCoV, the second most prevalent common cold virus, is known to be associated with exacerbations of asthma in children [16] and with pre\u2010school wheeze [17]. Also, symptoms may be virus\u2010dependent [18], so it is important to study viruses other than HRV. We have previously reported that LRT symptoms and increased bronchial responsiveness in EVW subjects occur only during symptomatic infection and that these effects are independent of atopy [4]. We now report further analysis of this model to test the hypotheses that during symptomatic experimental URTI with HCoV 229E (1) a qualitative or quantitative difference in lower respiratory tract cellular infiltration distinguishes subjects with EVW from controls, (2) cellular changes seen in the LRT are qualitatively similar in nature to those seen in the URT, and (3) there is an association between the quantitative changes in the LRT and both symptoms and change in bronchial responsiveness.",

The present study used less than half this amount of hypertonic saline given at a rate of 0.9 mL/min and no changes in neutrophils were seen in the sputum of controls, with or without colds, despite repeated inductions 48 h apart. Repeated nasal lavages could \u2018wash out\u2019 or conversely recruit cells to the nasal epithelium.

The slightly poorer repeatability at 2 days was suggested to be an effect of cell recruitment or wash\u2010out [29].

If neutrophils do cause LRT tissue damage in those who wheeze, then clearly these cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of EVW.

The nose also plays an important protective role for the LRT, not only by conditioning and filtering inspired air, but also by its ability to generate an immune response. The possibility of a nasal immune response, such as T cell activation, having LRT effects via circulating cells and mediators needs to be explored.
