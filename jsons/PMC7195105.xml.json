Mass testing, with or without symptoms, offers a method of controlling the spread of infection and provides epidemiologists with valuable information about viral hot spots.",

(Fig. 1, Fig. 2B\n) Random sampling is effective for building an infection rate picture, allowing, healthcare officials to take action. However, major differences exist between the US, South Korea and Iceland that makes mass testing an impracticable solution for countries with large population densities [[5], [6], [7]]. Rapid testing of ~15% of the US population is less feasible and comes at an exponentially higher cost. Still, actions are being taken to expand the diagnostic supplies needed to improve overall testing in the US [8].",
