            "text": "The bulb fields are important eye catchers in The Netherlands. Besides their visible attractiveness they have been of large economical importance. For this reason agricultural sciences traditionally flourished in The Netherlands. This included microbiology (or better bacteriology) to study and prevent contagious infections in plants. It was this setting that led Martinus Willem Beijerinck in 1898 to discover that a prevalent mosaic disease of tobacco, which was at that time an important crop, was caused by a filterable agent, that he called \u2018contagium vivum fluidum\u2019. He coined the term \u2018virus\u2019 for this agent, that now is known as tobacco mosaic virus 1. This was the start of the virology research tradition in The Netherlands. Up to today, virology is still a main research area in the biological sciences. The fundamental branch of Dutch gene therapy research was born out of this virology field. Progressions made by gene therapy scientists in The Netherlands have had a significant impact on the translation of gene therapy into the clinic both at a national and international level. The expertise of Dutch gene therapy scientists is also recognized at an international level, as demonstrated by the fact that various Dutch research groups participate in several of the pre\u2010clinical and clinical\u2010oriented European gene therapy projects supported by the Framework Programmes of the European Union (Table 1). This paper presents a brief overview on some milestones in Dutch basic gene therapy research as well as on past, present and future clinical gene therapy trials in The Netherlands.",

Adenoviruses were first identified by Rowe and colleagues in 1953 when they tried to establish cell lines from adenoidal tissue and tonsils 2. A transmissible agent was found responsible for degeneration of the cultures. More than 50 serotypes of human adenoviruses (HAdV) have been described to date, which have been classified in six \u2018species\u2019, A through F (formerly called \u2018subgroups\u2019).

These observations triggered Van der Eb in Leiden to use adenoviruses as a model for animal studies on cellular transformation in vitro and tumor induction in vivo. This led to the observation that the difference in oncogenicity correlates with the capacity of serotype\u201012, but not serotype\u20105, to down\u2010regulate antigen presentation by MHC class I 6, 7. This illustrated how important the immune system is for preventing tumor growth.",

This technique was used by Frank Graham in Alex van der Eb's lab to show that human cells, too, can be transformed and immortalized with naked adenovirus DNA. This is exemplified by the \u2018293\u2019 cell line obtained after transformation of embryonal kidney cells with sheared adenovirus serotype\u20105 DNA 10. Later, the Leiden group generated the \u2018911\u2019 cell line, by transfer of plasmids carrying defined adenovirus type 5 sequences into human embryonal retinoblasts 11. The observation that such adenovirus\u2010transformed cells can be used for propagating viruses with defects in their Early Region 1 (E1) gene 12 facilitated the development and use of replication\u2010defective adenovirus vectors. The relatively easy generation of E1\u2010deleted replication\u2010defective vectors made these vectors a prime choice for many gene therapists.",

During propagation of replication\u2010defective E1\u2010deleted adenovirus vectors replication\u2010competent adenoviruses (RCA) are being generated with high frequency. RCA are reverted vectors that re\u2010acquire the E1 region while losing the transgene cassette. This is the result of recombination between homologous sequences integrated in the helper cells and in the vector backbone 13. In an attempt to solve the problem the Leiden group, in collaboration with scientists at Introgene (now Crucell), generated the PER.C6 cell line 14. This line was established after transfer of a minimal portion of the adenovirus serotype 5 genome (bp 457\u20133510) into human embryonal retinoblasts, again using the calcium technique. In the process GLP conditions were used and the cell line, and the vectors produced on it, were extensively characterized 14, 15. This cell system has been used for the production of clinical\u2010grade adenovirus\u2010vector batches 16, 17. The use of this cell line in combination with matched E1\u2010deleted vectors that do not have sequence homology largely solved the issue of RCA generation by homologous recombination.",

While working as a PhD student in Alex van der Eb's group in Leiden, Dinko Valerio in 1983 was the first to report cloning of the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) cDNA and the corresponding gene 18. He embraced the retroviral vector technology and eventually used these vectors to transfer the ADA cDNA into hematopoietic stem cells of three ADA patients in a study performed with French and British scientists 19. This represented the first study in which hematopoietic stem cells of ADA patients were modified. In addition, Valerio founded the company IntroGene, now called Crucell. Crucell has been one of the key players in the adenoviral\u2010vector field and pioneered the use of fiber\u2010modified and adenovirus serotype 35 derived vectors to overcome the paucity of the adenovirus receptor CAR and circumvent pre\u2010existing immunity, respectively 20.",

Anton Berns in Amsterdam examined how murine leukaemia viruses (MLV) induced tumors upon infection in newborn mice. He recognized that the retroviruses found in tumors often had integrated into common sites. In these sites the proviruses disturbed the expression of nearby genes 21, 22. The commonality of the integration sites pointed to the association of the nearby genes with the induction of the leukemic state. Berns' analyses of common integration sites led to the identification of several genes that can be involved in leukaemia. The use of MLV infection in transgenic animals further delineated the pathways in virus\u2010induced leukaemia 23, 24. The relevance of these observations to gene therapy became all too apparent with the development of leukaemia in four infants born with X\u2010linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) gene who were successfully treated with an infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a defective retroviral vector 25.

Various labs in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Groningen, and Leiden are exploring diverse targeting strategies to increase the selectivity of adenoviruses as oncolytic agents. Transductional targeting is studied by Van Beusechem and collaborators, who replaced the adenovirus fiber with sequences of the spike protein of a reovirus 26, and by Hoeben and collaborators who developed the adenovirus minor capsid protein IX as an anchor for targeting ligands 27. Transcriptional targeting of the vectors to glioblastoma cells is employed by Sillevis Smitt and collaborators 28, to cholangiocarcinoma cells in Bosma's group 29, and to prostate cancer cells by Kraaij and collaborators 30. Optimized delivery methods and enhanced\u2010efficiency vectors are being evaluated in cell culture, spheroid cell aggregates 31, tumor explants 32, tissue slices 33, and in small\u2010animal models 34. These approaches are not limited to adenovirus vectors. Also RNA viruses such as reoviruses, alphaviruses and coronaviruses are being evaluated for use as in anticancer strategies. Kranenburg and collaborators linked the capacity of reovirus to induce tumor\u2010cell\u2010specific cell death to the propensity of reovirus to sensitize ras\u2010transformed cells to apoptosis 35. Wilschut pioneered the use of alphaviruses and used these for eradication of pre\u2010established tumors in an immunization protocol 36. In a collaborative project Rottier's and Gerritsen's groups redirected the mouse hepatitis coronavirus to human tumor cells using a monoclonal\u2010antibody dependent targeting strategy. This led to efficient syncytium formation in the tumor cells, which may eventually enhance the antitumor efficiency of this approach 37.",

In Groningen, the use of so\u2010called virosomes is being evaluated by Wilschut and collaborators. Virosomes are virus\u2010like particles, consisting of reconstituted virus envelopes, lacking any genetic material of the native virus. These studies provide insight into how macromolecules can be transferred across the cytoplasmic membrane and how the macromolecules can be released from the endosomes to the cytoplasm 36. In Utrecht, Hennink and collaborators are exploring the use of cationic polymer based gene delivery systems. The approach here is two\u2010sided: on the one hand new polymers are generated and characterized, and on the other hand cell biology is used to pinpoint which intracellular processes limit efficient gene transfer 42. The Lambin group in Maastricht is taking a radically different approach and has evaluated the use of recombinant anaerobic clostridial spores as highly selective gene delivery vectors 43. Ingenuity is also evident in the recent use of a tattoo device for intradermal DNA vaccination at the Dutch Cancer Institute in Amsterdam.

Dutch scientists have been in the front line in the field of clinical gene therapy as well. As mentioned earlier, the first clinical trial worldwide on the treatment of patients with ADA deficiency with autologous stem cells genetically modified with a retroviral vector was conducted by collaborating Dutch, French and British scientists 19. Susanne Osanto and collaborators in Leiden were amongst the first in Europe to treat patients with cancer with IL\u20102 gene\u2010modified allogeneic melanoma cells that express high levels of HLA\u2010A1 and \u2010A2 45. Furthermore, Chris Bangma in Rotterdam performed a clinical study on adenovirus\u2010mediated suicide gene therapy for prostate cancer on an outpatient basis 46.

An example is the Rotterdam trial (Table 3, protocol IM 97\u2010014) studying T lymphocytes retargeted to carbonic anhydrase IX as a treatment for metastasized renal cell carcinoma. This protein is overexpressed on these tumor cells. In addition, in Amsterdam AAV\u2010mediated gene therapy for patients with lipoprotein lipase deficiency is being tested (Table 3, protocol IM 05\u2010001) and exon skipping by an antisense oligoribonucleotide to restore dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients is being clinically evaluated in Leiden (Table 3, no protocol ID).",

In the Rotterdam trial on T lymphocytes retargeted to renal cell carcinoma described above (Table 3, protocol IM 97\u2010014), liver toxicity was encountered in the first three patients. The trial was allowed to continue according to an amended protocol 47 and two patients have now been included without side effects. In accordance to trials conducted in other countries, clear clinical efficacy of gene therapy has not been demonstrated yet in Dutch trials. In the two randomized and placebo\u2010controlled phase III trials on gene therapy for brain tumors (Table 2, protocols IM 95\u2010004/95\u2010015) and for critical limb ischemia in diabetes mellitus, efficacy could not be established 48 or the clinical effect was only minor 49. The first results reported for the Leiden trial studying suicide gene therapy in patients with a loosened hip prosthesis (Table 3, protocol IM 03\u2010001) are promising. In this trial, interface tissue around the implant is destroyed by suicide gene therapy prior to fixation of the prosthesis with cement. Ongoing and upcoming clinical trials now focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research aimed at improvement of efficacy and safety of this treatment modality. The first Dutch trials on oncolytic adenovirus therapy for cancer will be carried out in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (Table 4).

The programme aims to improve the translation of pre\u2010clinical gene therapy research to the clinic (http://www.zonmw.nl/genetherapy). So far, 11 phase I/II trials described in Tables 3 and 4 have been supported by this programme. ZonMw stimulates the cooperation of researchers and commercial enterprises. Besides investigator\u2010initiated clinical studies, commercial interest in clinical gene therapy in The Netherlands is increasing. The phase I/II clinical study in Leiden involving the suicide gene therapy approach for prosthesis refixation has been sponsored by Innovata Ltd. (Ruddington, UK). Currently, Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics is participating in the Amsterdam trial on lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Table 3, protocol IM 05\u2010001). Another Dutch company, Prosensa B.V. based in Leiden, is involved in the Leiden trial on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Table 3, no protocol ID). The Dutch drug development company ORCA Therapeutics B.V. in Amsterdam is currently preparing its lead product, an oncolytic adenovirus\u2010expressing tumor suppressor p53, for clinical evaluation in cancer patients. Another company, Arthrogen B.V. (Amsterdam), is developing AAV\u2010based gene therapy for rheumatoid arthritis for future clinical application. Furthermore, at least four Dutch clinical centres will participate in large phase III international multicenter immuno\u2010gene therapy trials on prostate cancer sponsored by Cell Genesys, Inc. (San Fransisco, USA) (Table 4, protocols IM 06\u2010001/06\u2010003/06\u2010010/06 011).",

The latter process has been greatly stimulated by the Translational Gene Therapy Research Programme supported by ZonMw. Many of the Dutch academic research centers have now made long\u2010term commitment to clinical research involving gene therapy, which has resulted in the establishment of various gene transfer facilities. The national regulatory conundrum has precipitated into the establishment of the Gene Therapy Office, which coordinates the assessment of the clinical protocols by the various regulatory bodies. This should aid the applicants and should warrant efficient communication between and amongst the pertinent regulatory bodies and the applicants (see paper by Bleijs et al., this issue). The atmosphere surrounding Dutch gene therapy may also be evident from the fact that several active Dutch scientists have accepted invitations to serve on review panels and advisory boards that are involved in the regulation of clinical gene therapy. Also the Dutch Society of Gene Therapy has a formal role in the evaluation of the Gene Therapy Office. This tight network of interrelations ensures efficient communication between the Dutch gene therapy community and bodies that should facilitate safe and efficient progress in this powerful field.",
