They are also critical components in disaster response and bioterrorism preparedness. PHLs often perform tests that are not commonly available Learning Objectives 1. Illustrate how Public Health Laboratory (PHL) functions differ from clinical labs, either at hospitals or national commercial laboratories. 2. Examine the full environment of the PH informatics domain; from the long term sustainability of an enterprise Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to the universe of data exchange partners and networks. 3.

Lead There are 54 State PHLs [ 4 ] ; they are found in every US state and territory as well as the District of Columbia. State PHLs often offer and perform tests that no other labs perform -be it for clinical practice (e.g., a regional reference lab for Salmonella serotyping) or environmental surveillance (e.g., well water testing). Their work informs public health offi cials in state government, allowing for targeted disease surveillance, quicker response to disease outbreak and provides population based data that may lead to new guidelines or policies to protect their residents. Where local PHLs are not available, the state PHL supports locally-needed public health activities. State PHLs also have the power to regulate private medical laboratories [ 5 ] and operate quality assurance programs (e.g., air quality or clean water act). During surveillance activities, the state PHL takes a leadership role through active collaboration with federal agencies, state epidemiologists, fi rst responders, and environmental professionals.",

Water samples are also tested at the PHL for a variety of reasons, but most importantly the PHL monitors both well water and public water systems. Food, be it peanut butter or spinach, is tested on a daily basis to detect pathogenic bacteria. Our soil, building materials and even cups and plates are tested to protect citizens from high levels of toxic chemicals such as lead.

            "text": "Since the advent of computers, the laboratory, with its capacity to produce and manage important data, has been at the forefront of health informatics. What initially began as a database for local results, over time developed into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that provides capacity for improved workfl ow management, inventory tracking, and most importantly, patient management. Testing is often performed on stand-alone instruments. These results need to be incorporated into the LIMS, in order to be included in the fi nal result sent to the submitter. In the beginning the LIMS was capturing only those results that needed to be printed to be sent back to the submitter. With the improvement of informatics knowledge in the PHLs more and more of the instruments are being interfaced, using industry developed standards, improving the quality of data and making the workfl ow more effi cient. Informatics practice certainly has transformed several laboratory workfl ows as organizations migrate from paper-based to electronic system-based tracking. Being able to draw data from a database in an electronic format facilitates secondary use of this information for forecasting or event detection. This information can then be shared with partners in the Public Health Laboratory system (e.g., the public health department, a regional taskforce, preparedness coordinators, policy makers and federal agencies). The capability of the laboratory and its public health partners to share data in the same format, through an electronic data interchange (EDI), can greatly reduce communication delays between partners; resulting in faster, better outcomes for both patient and population based responses. All these functions are covered by informatics principlesfrom database design to queries as well as application of format and content standards. 6 . Inventory and forms management 7. General Laboratory Reporting -is part of the general systems requirementsall electronic data management systems need to be able to create reports 8. Statistical analysis and surveillance -provides value added to the test results to both the submitters of the sample as well as public health partners 9. Billing for services 10. Contract and Grant management -unlike clinical laboratories, PHLs often are funded through grants to provide services free of charge to the submitter of the sample, so tracking funding amounts and requirements is important 11. Training, education and resource management -to comply with regulations and to document capacity of laboratory personnel and equipment 12. Lab certifi cations and licensing -PHLs, mostly at the state level, are responsible to ensure compliance in laboratories operating in their jurisdiction, which includes inspections of those laboratories 13. Customer feedback tracking 14. Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) management -both involve audit functionality about the tests performed -QC tracks the parameters for each method and instrument at the test level and allows for over time analysis of the control parameters, while QA defi nes specifi c measures across all the tests performed to ensure accurate testing 15. Laboratory safety and accident investigation 16. Laboratory mutual assistance and disaster recovery to support surge capacity and continuity of care operations Not all business processes apply to every lab, but across the spectrum of laboratories all of these business processes are relevant. This document describes interdependencies between the lab and outside partners and following informatics protocol decomposes each of the core business processes into their individual steps with related functional requirements for the system, based on detailed laboratory workfl ow analysis [ 8 ] . The publication of this requirements document has created a functional standard vendors can utilize to build more useful systems that are conformant with these requirements. Although much variability between information systems still exists, this requirement document has provided a solid basis to better identify and pin-point these variations.",
