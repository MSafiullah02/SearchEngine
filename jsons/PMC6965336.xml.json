Varying numbers of patients experiencing medication errors (MEs) have been described. In a recent report, the World Health Organization has marked MEs as a leading cause of avoidable harm to patients [2]. Medication errors are \u201can unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient\u201d [3]. Numerous heterogeneous factors have been described as a cause for the occurrence of MEs, ranging from e.g., phonetic (sound-a-like) and orthographic (look-a-like) medication names to confusion relating to appropriate dosage and route of administration to time pressure on medical personnel [4]. In view of the many different factors associated with MEs, reducing the risk of MEs by one single intervention is often not achievable. In addition, many stakeholders such as pharmaceutical companies, regulators, healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients and their caretakers have a role in the prevention of MEs. Therefore, strategies to minimise MEs should include all stakeholders and the need to address the different causes and phases of product development and the post-licensure treatment process. Pharmaceutical companies, responsible for product development and design, should consider possibilities to minimise MEs as early as possible in the development process.",

            "text": "If MEs are identified during the clinical development phase, these should preferably be resolved before the medicine enters the market. For example, if reconstitution and preparation of the final product are complicated and pose challenges already in the strictly controlled environment of the clinical trial, the pharmaceutical company should improve product preparation, whenever feasible, because the risk in daily practice might be even larger. In 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released guidance describing common areas of risks to be considered by industry and regulators before authorisation [5, 6]. It is highlighted here that the focus regarding MEs should not only be on within-product risks but also between-product risks, such as name similarity with already licensed products. In the European Union (EU), the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use Name Review Group evaluates the similarity of new product names with already approved products to limit confusion between products [7]. Despite pre-marketing efforts, not all ME risks can be completely eliminated, e.g., if multiple strengths of the same product are on the market there will be the potential for confusion between strengths. Routine risk minimisation through warnings and instructions in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and patient leaflet, or colour coding of the product name or dosages on packaging may be sufficient to minimise the risk of MEs. If routine measures are not expected to be sufficient to minimise the risk of MEs, additional risk minimisation measures (aRMMs) should be implemented.",

The EU-RMP describes the knowledge of the safety profile of a product at the moment of approval and provides a plan for areas that need further identification, characterisation and/or risk minimisation [8, 9]. The EU-RMP stimulates a pro-active approach towards risk management and minimisation. The EU-RMP is a dynamic document that is updated continuously during the lifetime of the medicinal product to reflect newly available information. A discussion on the risk of MEs is a mandatory part of the EU RMP [10] and, if appropriate, MEs can be included as an important risk in the RMP. In addition, pharmacovigilance activities and aRMMs to prevent MEs can be proposed [11, 12].",

A study by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency showed that MEs represented almost a quarter of the risks described in RMPs in the UK [14].

The proportion of ME safety concerns for which aRMM was implemented was variable over calendar time, ranging from 7.7% in 2016 to 54.5% in 2012 (Fig. 2). For all 23 products, aRMM included educational material that targeted HCPs in 85.2% and patients in 51.9% (Fig. 3). For eight of the 23 products (referring to ten safety concerns), educational material targeted both HCPs and patients. In addition to educational material, other aRMMs were requested for four products (referring to five safety concerns). Controlled access was requested for three products to address the following four ME safety concerns: risks of exposure of HCPs and close associates/transmission to third parties (n = 1), risks associated with (unintended) re-administration (n = 1), risk of administering the drug to the wrong patient (n = 1), and risk of dosing errors in the titration phase (n = 1). Controlled distribution was requested for one product to prevent accidental exposure of HCPs: an oncolytic immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of melanoma. It should be noted that the controlled distribution programme for this product is not related solely to the ME safety concern, but also to other safety concerns. The controlled distribution programme aims to minimise inappropriate handling and administration of the product and also aims to minimise the risk of damage to the product through inappropriate storing [18].",

Different designs were chosen for analysis of effectiveness. Registry studies were listed most frequently to analyse the effectiveness of aRMMs for MEs (n = 9). Other studies were described in the EPAR as follows: non-interventional observational studies not otherwise specified (n = 6), analysis of spontaneous reports (n = 5), surveys (n = 5), clinical trials (n = 4) and a drug utilisation study (n = 1). In two cases, the studies were primarily designed to investigate the effectiveness of aRMMs for MEs and, in the remaining 27 cases, the studies aimed to review the effectiveness of RMMs for multiple safety concerns simultaneously. Of the 68 ME safety concerns that did not require aRMMs, 13 were studied further in post-marketing studies. This was achieved through multiple study designs: drug utilisation studies (n = 5), disease registries (n = 3), a survey (n = 1) and observational studies not otherwise specified (n = 6). Five studies focused only on characterising the risk of a ME, whereas the remaining eight studies were general investigations into the post-marketing safety profile of the drug.",

A review of MEs and their RMMs may support regulators and biopharmaceutical medicine developers in future decision making and product development. Our study also has some limitations. The data collected in our study are based on EPAR documents publicly available on the EMA website. As these documents contain summarised information, data may be missing, e.g. the complete overview of routine RMMs. For example, it is not always described whether packaging and labelling is used to minimise the risk of ME. Therefore, this variable is not included in the study. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the efforts to prevent MEs. In addition, details of the studies that are planned to evaluate the effectiveness of risk minimisation are not always clearly presented in the EPAR. Availability of the complete EU-RMP in the public domain could improve data analysis. The lack of information in the EPAR was dealt with by investigating the original EU-RMPs for products with ME safety concerns identified form the EPAR where there was missing data. Another limitation of our study is that we only included products that had ME safety concerns at the moment of authorisation; therefore, we could not address MEs that were identified later in the product cycle. Our study only focused on risk minimisation of MEs in the EU. Other approaches to minimise the risk of MEs may exist in other areas and a comparison of approaches between different agencies is worth investigating.",
