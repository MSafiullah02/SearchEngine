Because of the relative infrequency of this disease, the patterns of metastasis in MCC are understudied. Methods. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edition) stage I-IV MCC treated at our institution were identified (1/1/2008-2/28/2018). The first site of metastasis was classified as regional [regional lymph node (LN) basin, in-transit] or distant. Distant metastasisfree (DMFS) and MCC-specific (MSS) survival were estimated. Results. Of 133 patients, 64 (48%) had stage I, 13 (10%) stage II, 48 (36%) stage III, and 8 (6%) stage IV disease at presentation. The median follow-up time in patients who remained alive was 36 (interquartile range 20-66) months. Regional or distant metastases developed in 78 (59%) patients. The first site was regional in 87%, including 73% with isolated LN involvement, and distant in 13%. Thirtyseven (28%) patients eventually developed distant disease, which most commonly involved the abdominal viscera (51%) and distant LNs (46%) first. The lung (0%) and brain (3%) were rarely the first distant sites. Stage III MCC at presentation was significantly associated with worse DMFS (hazard ratio 4.87, P = 0.001) and stage IV disease with worse MSS (hazard ratio 6.30, P = 0.002).",

            "text": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous malignancy, which was first described by Toker. 1 It often presents in sun-exposed areas as a rapidly growing, firm, nontender nodule and has been associated with immunosuppression, comorbid malignancies, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and infection by the Merkel cell polyomavirus. [2] [3] [4] Although its incidence has been rising in recent years, it remains a relatively rare malignancy, with only approximately 2500 cases diagnosed per year in the United States. 5 MCC is known to have a propensity for regional and distant metastasis and has been associated with a high mortality rate, with estimated 5-year overall survival rates of 14-51% depending on the extent of disease at presentation. 6 The current approach to staging for MCC includes primary tumor biopsy, complete skin and regional lymph node (LN) examination, and consideration of cross-sectional imaging for metastatic screening. 7 Because of frequent regional LN involvement, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is generally recommended for patients with clinically localized MCC, although a survival benefit has not been clearly demonstrated. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Distant metastasis also occurs frequently; institutional series demonstrate that approximately one-third of patients with MCC will eventually develop distant disease. 12, 13 However, because of the relative infrequency of this disease, the timing and frequencies of regional and distant disease spread have not been well characterized, resulting in relatively vague baseline and surveillance imaging recommendations.

The early and high rate of regional LN basin metastasis confirms the importance of SLNB for patients with clinically localized MCC. The SLN positivity rate was 25%, consistent with the range reported in the literature for MCC (23-45%) and comparable to that for thick melanoma (26-33%), for which SLNB is typically recommended. 8 surveillance following initial MCC treatment also should be prioritized. The false-negative rate for SLNB was relatively high at 22% in the present study and in the range of 15-21% in the literature. 8, [28] [29] [30] Accurate pathologic staging also could inform risk of distant disease recurrence. Distant-first recurrence was very rare in the SLNB-negative population (pathologic stage I/II), occurring in only one patient, but developed in 56% of patients with stage III MCC who subsequently relapsed. Furthermore, on baseline imaging, only 2% of patients had isolated distant disease without regional nodal involvement, and a minority (13%) of all study patients had distant disease spread as the first metastatic event. These findings suggest that regional LN metastasis likely precedes distant metastasis in a majority of patients. Lymphovascular invasion may be an early occurrence in MCC, present in 90% of primary tumor samples in one study, while isolated blood vascular invasion is much less common in only 3%. 31 By identifying regional nodal metastases early, appropriate treatments could be offered in a timely manner to perhaps prevent distant disease relapse. 10, 19 Additionally, the presence of LN metastases at the time of MCC presentation was associated with significantly worse DMFS, whereas resection margin of the primary tumor was not associated with either DMFS or MSS, consistent with recent findings by Perez et al. 32 It may be appropriate to choose a feasible margin of excision without compromising necessary adjuvant treatments, as recommended by national practice guidelines. 7 In the current study, primary tumor radiation therapy also was associated with improved DMFS and MSS, consistent with findings from a multicenter study that demonstrated improved locoregional disease control, DMFS, and MSS among patients with MCC who received adjuvant primary tumor radiation. 33 Distant LNs and intra-abdominal organs were most often the first sites of distant metastases in the present study, consistent with previous findings that these sites are frequently involved in metastatic MCC. 12, 13, 34 While we found that the lung (0%) and brain (3%) were rarely the first sites of distant spread, they may be subsequently involved in 30% and 13% of patients, respectively. 34 Understanding these patterns of metastasis may help to guide follow-up imaging strategies. For example, chest and abdominopelvic imaging, especially in patients who already have regional LN involvement, should be routinely performed for restaging, whereas dedicated brain imaging may be reserved for patients who demonstrate concerning signs and symptoms.",

PET/CT was the most common baseline imaging modality utilized in 68% of our study patients. In a small study of 18 patients with MCC, Concannon et al. found that PET/CT altered staging for 7 (33%) and changed management for 9 (43%) patients. Hawryluk et al. reported that PET/CT upstaged 16% of patients who underwent baseline scans at presentation of MCC. 12 In contrast, CT appears to have high sensitivity for distant MCC spread (100%), but very poor specificity (48%). 10 Limitations of the current study include its retrospective nature and moderately sized cohort. While multivariable analyses adjusted for some covariates, these could not account for unobserved or unrecorded differences between patient groups. Patients classified as stage I and II may have represented a relatively heterogeneous population, because not all of these patients were pathologically staged, which could partially explain the absence of a significant difference in DMFS and MSS between these groups. Preliminary subgroup analyses of disease recurrence patterns among patients who were pathologically staged were presented here and will be further validated in a multicenter study. Additionally, patients received variable treatments, the heterogeneity of which may not be fully accounted for in the analyses of recurrence and survival outcomes. Finally, there may be a referral bias to an academic center of patients with more advanced disease or complex comorbidities, which could affect the generalizability of our findings.",
