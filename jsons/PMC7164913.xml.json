Already back in the 1960s, calls on Robert F. Kennedy to hold a conference on robotics and labour, and later to start a Federal Automation Commission were both dismissed (Calo, 2017). Although the questions of fairness and ethics of computer systems have been already asked in the 1990s (Friedman and Nissenbaum, 1994), it is the report by US President's National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology (The White House, 2016), that has captured the attention of as diverse fora as national governments, international organisations (eg. UNDP, OECD, EU) industrial groups (eg. IEEE, WEF, AAAI, Partnership on AI), and academia. Although scholars fail to agree on the definitional explanation of Artificial Intelligence for over half a century (Russel & Norvig, 2013), the working definition assumed in this document is in line with that proposed by the European Commission: \u201csystems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions \u2013 with some degree of autonomy \u2013 to achieve specific goals\u201d (European Commission, 2018a). Other than that, the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning and automated decision-making are used interchangeably.",

The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is justified by its far-ranging consequences, spanning almost every walk of life - from labour markets (Frey & Osborne, 2013), through human rights protection (Eubanks, 2018) to healthcare (Jiang et al., 2017).

It is with that in mind, that we shall consider our research question: how the use of AI in the public sector can be intensifying existing power asymmetries and governance practices? The time to ask such question could not be better: scholars have been pointing to the limitations of focusing solely on algorithmic bias (Dave, 2019), calling for the politicization of the discourse on AI (McQuillan, 2018), and proposing more granular frameworks of algorithmic accountability (Pasquale, 2019).",

Global thought-leadership circuit consisting of few key international fora, and a relentless nature of parliamentary politics of round the clock campaigning, forces political leaders to constantly overpromise and compare their country's performance to those of the immediate socio-economic surroundings. Hence, the narratives of competition and \u201carms race\u201d is born and mirrored in the policy choices of the decision-makers. The introduction of \u2018business-like\u2019 practices that New Public Management brought into the government over 30 years ago, has translated into the wide adoption of market solutions, such as standards, incentives and benchmarks. These, have only been amplified by the turn towards evidence-based policy-making. However, with the rise of predictive analytics and automated decision making, the very nature of knowledge base is changing towards overwhelming quantification. Carving through insurmountable heaps of data, algorithms derive insights and find correlations that are not apparent to human cognition. Although regularly escaping scrutiny, their findings often pass as \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018neutral\u2019. It is by no means the bureaucrats fault to be tempted to embrace risk-based assessments. Assigning numeric value to any activity and hiding behind the machine produced \u2018evidence\u2019 shields imperfect humans from the accusations of bias, misdemeanor and inefficiency. At the same time, the drive towards rivalry and international benchmarking increases data collection. More fine grained data about citizens may mean increased oversight, and is in itself a powerful tool of global governance (Johns, 2017). Paraphrasing the old adage that \u201cwhat gets measured, gets done\u201d, one could say that \u201cwhat gets data mined, gets done\u201d - data collection and analysis is indeed a powerful tool of meaning-making, ordering knowledge about the world and focusing our collective attention.",

High-level national AI strategies seem to have little to do with the lived experience of the bureaucrats dealing with citizens perplexed by unfavorable machine powered verdicts. A recent paper (Veale & Brass, 2019) has proposed a useful three level categorization of barriers to the development of public sector machine learning:i)Macro level requires creation of new cross-cutting individual rights and obligations. These need to be supported by upskilling of bureaucrats who now need to be able to fully assess the intended and unintended consequences of AI against public values, such as accuracy, fairness, transparency and equityii)Meso level requires the development of more dynamic ways to measure, monitor and evaluate the inputs, process information, outputs, outcomes and impacts of public programmes using machine learning, which poses a challenge to established measures of public sector performance, quality and risk assessmentiii)Micro level requires the emergence of new tensions between the legitimacy of algorithmic decisions used in frontline service delivery, the discretion of street-level bureaucrats when employing, assessing or overriding automated decisions, and the rights of the data subjects when these processes are used to inform the allocation of public goods and services.\n",

Much has been written about how workplace culture can hamper innovation in the public sector (Arundel, Bloch, & Ferguson, 2019). Skills shortage, lack of technology literacy and inability to meaningfully audit commissioned technologies are all potential hindering factors. Introduction of the comprehensive General Dave Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 as an overarching data governance mechanism (European Commission, 2016) could on its own terms be seen as a potential barrier, given how much emphasis it places on individual vs collective rights, and how inconsistent its enforcement has been across constituencies (European Commission, 2019).\n",
