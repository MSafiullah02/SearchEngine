Though the outlook remains uncertain, COVID-19 has already caused far greater morbidity and mortality than other human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 1 To limit disease transmission, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommended protective behaviors such as hand hygiene and social distancing. 2 Mass adoption of these behaviors is especially important when pharmacological interventions are not yet available. 3 According to theories of decisions about health behavior, people who perceive greater risks are more motivated to implement protective behaviors. [4] [5] [6] Hence, assessing associations between risk perceptions and protective behaviors has practical and theoretical relevance.",

It is unclear how people perceive the risks, or whether their initial risk perceptions inform their decisions about protective actions. 8 Therefore, the study objective is to examine people's initial risk perceptions for COVID-19 infection and infection fatality, as well as associations of these initial risk perceptions with self-reported protective behaviors. Because the survey was completed between mid-to-late March 2020, the authors were able to add exploratory analyses to examine how risk perceptions, protective behaviors, and their associations varied as the initial stage of the epidemic unfolded.",

To answer the main research question  about the relationship between risk perceptions and protective behaviors, authors conducted   separate logistic regressions predicting each of the protective behaviors, including handwashing, avoiding crowds, avoiding contact with people who could be high risk, and canceling or postponing air travel. Because ORs for continuous scales with small units (such as the 0%-100% risk perception scales) can be difficult to interpret, these logistic regressions were conducted with the quartile-based risk perceptions as predictors (Tables 3 and 4 ). Specifically, respondents were divided into quartiles by perceived risk (or four similar-sized groups of respondents giving the lowest 25% to the highest 25% of responses). The authors also created graphs presenting the percentage of participants who reported protective behaviors, by quartile of risk perception ( Figure 3 ). Analogous logistic regressions with continuous risk perceptions yielded similar results (Table 5) , as did Pearson correlations that did not include control variables (Table 6 ). In each of the reported logistic regressions, predictor variables were perceived infection risk and perceived infection fatality risk for COVID-19, while accounting for whether or not participants responded later (between March 13 and 31, 2020=1; between March 10 and 12, 2020=0); were in the at-risk group aged \u226565 years (yes=1, no=0); identified as male (yes=1, no=0); identified as African American (yes=1, no=0), Hispanic/Latinx (yes=1, no=0), or another minority (yes=1, no=0) versus white; had a college degree (yes=1, no=0); and lived in one of the states that was worst hit at the time of the survey (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or Washington=1; other state=0).",

Authors computed t-tests to compare risk perceptions of later versus earlier responders. Chi-square tests compared reported protective behaviors of later versus earlier responders. This study also examined contributions of later versus earlier responding in the logistic regression models that predicted each protective behavior (Table 3 ). To examine whether relationships between risk perceptions and protective behavior differed between later versus earlier responders, Figure 4 added interactions between later versus earlier responding and each risk perception to logistic regressions predicting each protective behavior (Tables 3, 4, and 5), and logistic regressions were run separately for later responders and earlier responders (Tables 7 and 8 ).",

It is possible that this finding also reflected the aforementioned ceiling effect in the uptake of handwashing. A cross-sectional study conducted during the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in the Netherlands reported similar effect sizes as the ones reported here, for correlations between perceived SARS infection risk and reports of protective behaviors. 14 By comparison, crosssectional and longitudinal reports of correlations between perceived risk of infection with seasonal influenza and getting the influenza vaccine appeared to be somewhat higher than the correlations between risk perceptions and protective behaviors reported here. 7,15 However, a cross-sectional study of risk perceptions for hypothetical pandemic influenza showed no significant correlations with protective behaviors in Asian or European regions that were not experiencing outbreaks at the time. 16 These findings are in line with construal level theory of psychological distance, which posits that risks that are perceived as uncertain or further in the future may reduce willingness to act. 17 At the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is possible that many people were still hesitant to act on their risk perceptions and preferred taking a \"wait and see\" approach-perhaps especially because social distancing can be perceived as difficult and costly.",

However, these findings held when accounting for respondent characteristics (Tables 3, 4, and 5).

One limitation is that this cross-sectional study yielded only correlational findings, and that survey days were not assigned randomly, which precludes causal conclusions. For example, correlations between risk perceptions and reported actions could reflect the effect of a third variable, such as risk messages that increased both. Another limitation is that behaviors were self-reported, and may have reflected social desirability bias. 18 Longitudinal studies are needed to understand how risk perceptions, protective behaviors, and their associations changed over time, beyond the early stages of the epidemic. 13,15 Over time, it is possible that people who take actions to protect themselves may subsequently perceive less COVID-19 risk. As an example, people who have received a seasonal influenza vaccination have been found to lower their perceived risk afterward. 15 These analyses included no measures of perceived uncertainty or timing of the risk, which would have been needed to further understand the role of psychological distance in hesitancy to act on initial risk perceptions. The analyses also included no measures of other factors that could have potentially motivated protective behaviors, such as perceptions of the chance of infecting others, social norms, the ability to implement protective behaviors and bear any associated costs, or the need to follow policymakers' recommendations and stay-at-home orders. [4] [5] [6] CONCLUSIONS Even though people in the U.S. seemed to disagree about the risks associated with COVID-19 in the early stages of the epidemic, those perceiving greater risks were more likely to report that they implemented protective behaviors-and more so later (versus earlier) in March 2020.",

            "text": "In March 2020, COVID-19 was still an emerging risk. In this nationally representative U.S. sample, none of the participants had yet been diagnosed with the disease or thought they had been infected. Participants showed large disagreements in their perceived risk for getting infected with COVID-19 and dying from it if they were to become infected. Yet, the findings suggest that the U.S. respondents were already acting on their risk perceptions of COVID-19 in mid-to-late March 2020. Specifically, this study found greater reported implementation of protective behaviors to avoid COVID-19 among those who perceived greater COVID-19 infection risk and greater COVID-19 infection fatality risk. Participants' decisions to implement most protective actions seemed to have been motivated by wanting to reduce their risk of COVID-19 infection, and, less so, to reduce their risk of COVID-19 mortality. It is possible that the perceived COVID-19 infection risk had a stronger relationship with protective behaviors than perceived COVID-19 infection fatality risk, because COVID-19 was perceived to have severe consequences other than death, including serious illness and self-quarantine. By comparison, perceived infection risk was also more strongly correlated to intentions to get vaccinated than perceived infection fatality risk in a longitudinal study following its U.S. participants during the first year of the H1N1 epidemic.13",
