In September 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged as a novel virus that can result in severe respiratory disease with renal failure, with a case fatality rate of up to 38%. Primary infections typically occur in countries located in the Middle East, where dromedary camels have been identified as one of the species harboring the virus. However, travel has contributed to several cases in other countries. Notably, between May and July 2015, an outbreak of MERS-CoV centered in South Korea killed 36 people out of 186 confirmed cases (Promedmail.org, 2015), with thousands quarantined as health authorities attempted to control virus spread.",

The latter three countries also had reported human cases of MERS-CoV during the same period of time. After the patient started exhibiting disease symptoms, he sought medical assistance at several clinics before being admitted to a hospital, where he was confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV (WHO, 2015a). Twenty-nine secondary infections have since been directly traced to this index patient. Additionally, two of these secondary cases were shown to be responsible for 106 subsequent infections, out of 166 known cases at the time (Cowling et al., 2015). Transmission was mostly within nosocomial settings, and fourth generation infections have been documented for the first time since the virus was identified in 2012. Thus, the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea was driven primarily by three infected individuals, and approximately 75% of cases can be traced back to three super-spreaders who have each infected a disproportionately high number of contacts (Figure 1\nA). This MERS-CoV outbreak is the second largest on record and the largest outside of the Middle East. The MERS-CoV outbreak currently appears to be under control, with no additional infections reported in South Korea since July 4, 2015.",

Epidemiological work has linked five infections with a 2-year-old toddler in the remote village of Meliandou, Guinea. One of the contacts, a midwife, infected at least three others, including a hospital worker at Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou hospital. This worker then infected several family members in the Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou Farako district, as well as 15 others at Macenta hospital (Baize et al., 2014). One of the subsequent cases, a doctor, was known to have infected several others who traveled to Kissidougou and Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, further propagating virus transmission (Baize et al., 2014). The outbreak eventually spilled over to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, the funeral of a traditional healer that died from EBOV was shown to have directly infected 13 others (Gire et al., 2014) and was eventually linked to more than 300 cases (WHO, 2015b). The EBOV outbreak has killed 11,284 people, with 27,741 infected as of July 19 2015, en route to becoming the largest filovirus outbreak ever documented. In addition to EBOV, super-spreading has also been documented in outbreaks with other pathogens, including measles (Paunio et al., 1998) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Kline et al., 1995).",

The ability of the pathogen to infect subsequent super-spreaders who may export the disease through travel is likely the difference between an infection cluster and an outbreak or epidemic (Figure 1C). Differences in the initial response to MERS-CoV is why South Korea reported clusters of infections before bringing the virus under control and why China, Thailand, and the Philippines have not reported any additional cases despite imported MERS-CoV infections. It was why SARS-CoV was so devastating in mainland China and Hong Kong from 2002 to 2003. It was also why the 2014\u201315 EBOV outbreak spiraled out of control in Western Africa, with hundreds of new cases reported weekly, before a coordinated international effort (including contact tracing, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment of infected patients, as well as community education) brought the number down to a more manageable 20\u201330 weekly infections, with most of the cases diagnosed in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Early discovery, diagnosis, intervention, and quarantine of confirmed cases is crucial for preventing further disease transmission in humans, especially via super-spreaders. As evidenced by the decreased numbers of new cases in the MERS-CoV and EBOV outbreaks, current responses are effective, provided that the measures are implemented properly and followed strictly. Vigilance and patience will be necessary until the ongoing MERS-CoV and EBOV outbreaks are officially at an end.",

Animals could be experimentally infected with different virus strains/variants at varying doses via different challenge routes, in which virus shedding from the oral, nasal, and rectal cavities should be correlated with different parameters, including viremia or virus titers in the organs. However, these studies are currently challenging for SARS-CoV as there is currently not an appropriate animal model that replicates the severe disease seen in humans; infected nonhuman primates exhibit variable, but at most mild to moderate, respiratory disease (McAuliffe et al., 2004) (Lawler et al., 2006). Nonetheless, these types of studies are feasible for MERS-CoV. A model of this infection was developed in the common marmoset that results in severe respiratory disease and partial lethality, in which live virus can be detected in nasal and throat swabs of infected animals (Falzarano et al., 2014).

EBOV shedding is known to occur from the oral, nasal, and/or rectal cavities of nonhuman primates during the advanced stages of disease, but factors that influence virus shedding from these animals have not yet been investigated. Interestingly, using a guinea pig model, it was shown that animals infected intranasally (i.n.) with guinea pig-adapted EBOV were more contagious to naive contact animals than those that were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the same dose (Wong et al., 2015). I.n. infected animals shed virus from their nasal cavity earlier than their i.p. counterparts, and i.p. challenged animals died earlier (and thus were removed from contact with naive animals) compared to i.n. inoculated guinea pigs. It was therefore concluded that the route of infection in addition to the duration of contact time with an infectious host may be factors that influence the efficiency of virus transmission. It will take time to elucidate all possible host and viral factors that contribute to virus shedding, which remains an understudied topic to date. Therefore, it is not currently possible to predict with any level of confidence or statistical significance whether a person will become a super-spreader of a certain disease. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of super-spreaders might provide some clues about the genetic backgrounds of super-spreaders, but the feasibility and robustness of these analyses will depend on the number of super-spreaders in a given outbreak.",

Any mutations that are identified and are absent from the viral genomes of other patients could be indicators of enhanced virus shedding, allowing for super-spreading to occur.",

            "text": "A complex combination of factors likely plays a role in the number of subsequent infections initiating from a single super-spreader. In addition to host and virus factors, other important factors impacting the spread of infectious diseases are the environment and behavior of individuals. Environmental factors include the close proximity of other susceptible hosts and the airflow dynamics within an enclosed area. A high population density represents a greater number of susceptible hosts for direct/indirect contact with an infected person, whereas air re-circulation would especially facilitate the transmission of airborne viruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Hospitals, enclosed housing complexes, and mass transportation, such as airplanes, are documented sites of super-spreader events, especially during the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks (Table 1\n). Individual behaviors may also enhance disease spread. These include \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d\u2014going to multiple hospitals to treat the same ailments or traveling to other countries after the appearance of disease symptoms, which was observed with the MERS-CoV outbreak (Su et al., 2015). Traditional customs, such as unsafe funerals/burials in Africa, which involve direct contact with infectious bodily fluids of patients that passed away from EBOV disease, is another major reason why the outbreak persisted in Guinea and Sierra Leone (Table 1). A thorough study of host, virus, and environmental dynamics will be important to delineate the relative contribution of each factor to the phenomenon of super-spreading. Findings from these studies, combined with changes in behavior conducive to the spread of disease, will be important for the effective management of and preparation for future outbreaks.",
