These functions may be compromised by critical illness. The regular life span of RBCs is approximately 120 days which means that there must be constant production of new cells. This process requires crucial factors such as iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B12 as well as the influence of several hormones including erythropoietin (EPO), thyroxin, androgens, cortisol, and catecholamines. With aging, properties of the RBC change, including oxygen binding affinity, ability to deform during microvascular transit, and structural morphology which marks it for destruction by the spleen and reticuloendothelial system (RES) [1]. Due to inflammation, nutritional deficiencies, renal failure, and decreased EPO levels, these changes occur even sooner and shorten the life span of RBCs in critical illness.",

Physiologic stress, especially in those with head trauma and who are mechanically ventilated, can lead to stress ulceration and acute bleeding. In one prospective study, 10 % of all patients admitted to the ICU developed bleeding [3]. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most common site, accounting for up to 30 % of all significant bleeding in the ICU.

Unlike healthy individuals where decreased hemoglobin levels and hypoxia trigger almost immediate production and release of EPO, this response is blunted in the critically ill patient. This blunted response can be explained by the high prevalence of renal failure in this population. In addition, inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1) inhibit EPO gene transcription in renal juxtaglomerular cells and the response to EPO in the bone marrow, suppress iron release from storage sites, and increase iron sequestration.",

Some of these defects are inherited (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency) or defects may be acquired as in autoimmune diseases, malaria, hepatitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In extrinsic hemolysis normal RBCs are produced but are destroyed iatrogenically. Examples include infusion of hypotonic solutions, mechanical valves, intra-aortic balloon pumps, as well as toxic effects of commonly used medications such as antibiotics, sulfa drugs, and acetaminophen [2].",

Serum iron is not a particularly reliable test because it is altered by a variety of conditions including infection, inflammation, neoplasm, and liver disease. Its sensitivity and specificity are 78 and 35 %, respectively, and thus it should not be used alone in determining the etiology of anemia. Serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant, is increased with chronic inflammation, and can also be affected by acute inflammation, infection, and malnutrition. Although a low ferritin level is highly suggestive of iron deficiency (sensitivity and specificity are 71 and 69 %, respectively), an iron-deficient patient can have a high ferritin level. The normal range for ferritin is between 100 and 800 ng/ml. Although cut-off values for iron supplementation in the ICU have not been established, some authors suggest using ferritin <100 ng/ml as an indication to begin iron therapy. Transferrin saturation provides information about the amount of iron available for erythropoiesis. The National Kidney Foundation recommends values of 20\u201350 %. Transferrin saturation of <20 % indicates diminished iron availability and depending on the clinical setting, the need for iron supplementation. However, in critically ill patients with low transferrin saturation and high ferritin levels, this can indicate functional iron deficiency [2].",

Several trials have since demonstrated that in the environment of restrictive transfusion, EPO therapy does not improve survival and may increase thrombotic complications. One potential explanation for this lack of efficacy may be due to the significant lag time between administering EPO and its onset of action. It is important to note that when EPO therapy is considered, it should always be given concomitantly with iron supplementation to ensure maximum benefit.

Changes in the diagnostic criteria and the availability of effective treatment have led to an increase in the number of patients treated for TTP with plasma exchange. Acute idiopathic TTP, an autoimmune disease, is the most common form of TTP and is characterized by antibodies against ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase also known as von Willebrand Factor Cleaving Protease [32]. Other subtypes of TTP include HIV-associated, pregnancy-associated (5\u201325 % of cases), and drug-associated TTP (<15 % of cases). The diagnostic term HUS is used to refer to children who have thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in the presence of renal failure. Most children have a diarrhea prodrome, and plasma exchange is rarely used since supportive care is associated with good survival. The term HUS is not used to describe adults with the same criteria. Multiple disorders can occur similarly to TTP, such as disseminated carcinoma, infections, malignant hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), and renal disorders; therefore, it is important to consider and exclude alternative causes. ADAMTS13 activity <5 % is specific for TTP, but does not identify all patients that may relapse, whereas a level of <10 % may better capture patients at risk for relapse.

Most current data on rFVIIa are from trauma patients and suggest that while it can reduce the use of RBCs it does not change the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate or platelet products, and does not affect mortality. PCC contains coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X and the anticoagulation proteins C and S and may especially benefit patients with acute bleeding from coagulopathy related to vitamin K antagonism. Unlike FFP transfusion, which requires time to test for ABO compatibility, thawing and usually larger volumes to correct the coagulopathy, PCC can be administered very quickly and can correct the INR more predictably. TA is a synthetic derivative of lysine which inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the lysine binding sites of plasminogen.
