Purified splenic T cells (1\u00d7105 cells/ well) were cultured for 4 days with irradiated antigen-presenting cells (5\u00d7105 cells/well) in the absence or presence of viral antigens (at concentrations of 0.1 \u03bc/mL and 1 \u03bc/mL). The concentration of interferon (IFN)\u2014\u03b3 in culture supernatants was then measured by use of ELISA for the mouse cytokine (Biosource International). T cell proliferation was monitored by the addition of [3H]thymidine (18.5 kBq/well) (ICN Biomedicals) 8 h before the cells were harvested. The cells were harvested onto a 96-well microplate bonded with a GF/B filter (Packard Instruments).

The subcutaneously inoculated mice showed the typical ruffled fur and neurological symptoms, such as tremor and spinning, evidenced by moribund mice; in contrast, the mice not challenged with A/Vietnam/1194/04 virus showed no ruffled fur and appeared to be healthy. In challenges with 1000 pfu of A/HongKong/483/97 virus, mice that had been inoculated with both the trivalent vaccine and Ampligen showed a 25% reduction in virus titer, compared with noninoculated mice (figure 1B).

Compared with noninoculated mice, those inoculated, intranasally or subcutaneously, with both the trivalent vaccine and Ampligen manifested a lower virus titer in nasal-wash samples at 3 days after challenge with H5N1 influenza virus. However, whereas intranasal inoculation effectively improved the survival rate of mice infected with antigenically distinct H5N1 virus strains, subcutaneous inoculation did not. We speculate that this cross-protection may be mediated by the mucosal immune response, probably via secretory IgA antibodies to viral proteins. Elsewhere, we have shown that polymeric immunoglobulin receptor\u2014knockout mice do not secrete IgA and show less cross-protective efficacy against variant influenza virus infection, when challenged with either influenza A virus or influenza B virus [26, 27]. However, anti-HA or anti-NA antibodies that normally act as neutralizing antibodies do not seem to contribute to such cross-protection, because none of the nasal-wash and serum samples collected from inoculated mice in the present study exhibited crossneutralizing activity in vitro (table 2); these antibodies neutralized the HI activity of the viruses whose subtypes are the same as those of the respective vaccine strains (table 1). These findings may be interpreted as suggesting that IgA antibodies specific for viral internal proteins are important for heterosubtypic protection, because some secretory IgA antibodies may neutralize virus infectivity during transcytosis in the infected epithelial cells [28\u201330].",

These results further support the notion that the heterologous protection achieved by such inoculation is largely attributable to cross-reactive secretory IgA. The cross-protective immunity seems to correlate with virus replication in noninoculated mice. Although noninoculated and intranasally inoculated mice were challenged with the same titer of the A/Vietnam (H5N1) virus, the virus titer in the noninoculated mice was different in every experiment, a finding that explains the observed difference in cross-protective effects (table 2 and figure 1).",

The limitation to this approach has been that traditional dsRNAs are experimental agents, which have not been approved for human use and/or have exhibited significant toxicity (i.e., in the case of polyI:polyC) in human clinical trials. The one exception is the dsRNA product, Ampligen (polyI:polyC12U).
