The detailed composition of reaction reagents, together with the primers and probe targeting the specific sequence of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 are listed in Table 1\n[6]. Finally, 5 \u03bcL of the RNA template was added to the amplification mixture, and distilled water was added to a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. Amplification conditions were as follows: 42\u00b0C for 60 s, followed by 50 cycles of 96\u00b0C for 4 s and 58\u00b0C for 8 s. Amplification results were considered positive if an exponential amplification curve was generated that could be distinguished from that of the negative control.

RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples is still a core technology for determining the need for the hospitalization and isolation of patients with COVID-19, but this method generates false negatives and is time consuming [8]. A history of exposure to patients with COVID-19 along with the characteristic CT findings of viral pneumonia strongly suggest COVID-19 and can provide a basis for patient management, even if a sample is negative by RT-qPCR [9, 10]. However, CT images are not specific to COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of RT-qPCR with extremely high diagnostic specificity for comprehensive diagnosis. The GeneSoC\u00ae assay, which requires a short test period and is not labor-intensive, can contribute to the diagnosis and management of patients and thereby to the prevention of hospital-acquired infections.",
