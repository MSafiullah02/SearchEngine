            "text": "The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics. Additionally, general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting COVID-19 are addressed. This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B-and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection. Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main protease (Mpro) is available. The reported structure of the target Mpro was described in this review to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using virtual high throughput screening. 6 initiatives focusing on determining the 3D structures of proteins on a genome-scale [21] and specific efforts on rapid structural characterization of proteins in emerging viruses [22, 23] , multiple works have used comparative modeling to predict the structures of protein-protein interaction complexes [24-26], facilitating structure-based drug discovery [20, 27, 28], inferring protein functions [29], determining the macromolecular interaction network [30-32], and providing molecular insights into viral evolution [33-35].",

However, experimental data of the same scale for Sars-CoV-2 may take years to obtain by the research community. By leveraging the previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structure and function, bioinformaticians have been successfully helping the virologists by structurally characterizing proteins of novel viruses, determining the evolutionary trajectories, identifying interactions with host proteins, and providing other important biological insights. In particular, a plethora of results have been achieved through comparative, or homology, modeling principles [19, 20] . In addition to the global structural genomics 7 Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with different host-cell receptor binding patterns [39] , as well as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus [41] , there are several limitations on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches. Antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1) .",

Development of novel drugs is a time-consuming process and generally, several years of work are required for clinical approval [121] . Drug repositioning, also known as repurposing, is an effective strategy to combat novel diseases caused by infectious agents that spread rapidly [123] . Drugs that have been approved for some disease, are safe for human use, and only their effectiveness against the disease of interest needs to be established [124] . In life-threatening cases, where there is no alternative medicine or vaccine, such a drug repurposing strategy is particularly attractive. However, clinical trials are necessary to ensure that such treatment is better than a placebo [125] .",

During the epidemic and pandemic outbreak of new viral pathogens, the conventional method of development of drugs and vaccination is not possible to control as it is a time-consuming process [128, 129] . Consequently, the rapid approach based on in-silico informatics has become very popular with recent advances in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases [130] [131] [132] . The continuous increase of patients and a high mortality rate of Sars-CoV-2 infection highlight the urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine [133] . The aim of this is to use to computational approach to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. The spike protein in the novel coronavirus sequence is used to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. For anti-viral drug design, receptor-binding protein of novel coronavirus present in the N-terminal of spike protein is homology modeled and used as a protein receptor [134] . 3C like proteinase (3CLpro) plays a role in viral pathogenicity and replication by clevaging the polyprotein. The inhibitors of 3CLpro can block the clevage reaction thereby controlling viral replication and pathogenicity [135] . The natural inhibitors were used as ligands and docked with homology modelled coronavirus receptor binding protein [136] . For vaccine design, the full sequence of the spike protein of novel coronavirus is used to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes. The select best T-cell epitopes based on antigenicity used as peptides and docked with human allele protein.",

Therefore, it is necessary to find and evaluate treatment methods more quickly in this case computer methods are very effective and helpful. The predicted binding and ranking of drugs will also be useful to interpret the results of ongoing clinical trials that are testing existing drugs for effectiveness against COVID-19. Notwithstanding the limitations, it has been described several diseases and traits which may be causally related to ACE2 expression the lung, which in turn may mediate susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the proteome-wide MR analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ACE2 expression. Subsequent drug repositioning analysis highlighted several candidates that may warrant further investigations. We stress that most of the findings require replications and validation in further studies, especially the part on drug repositioning. Nevertheless, it is believed that this work is of value given the urgency to address the outbreak of Sars-CoV-2.",
