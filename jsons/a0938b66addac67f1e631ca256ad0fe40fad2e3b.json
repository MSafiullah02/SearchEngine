Potential donors from patients with brain death should be managed in such a way that their left ventricular ejection fraction remains above 45% and mean arterial pressure should be maintained at 60 mmHg with a central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure no higher than 8 and 12 mmHg, respectively. There is no level-one evidence to support a specific type of fluid over another; however, intuitively colloids may help minimize pulmonary edema. Acidosis should be corrected if pH is less than 7.2, and this may be accomplished with hyperventilation or the addition of bicarbonate solutions to resuscitative fluids. Most transplant surgeons prefer lung protective strategies for ventilation as this has been shown to increase donor eligibility [76] .

Minimizing the cold ischemia time is perhaps the most controllable variable and thus every effort should be made to prevent prolongation of the ischemic time. There is some data in animal models suggesting that slow reperfusion (over a 10-min period intraoperatively) decreases the effects of reperfusion injury. The addition of prostaglandins to preservative fluids may also be beneficial according to some animal models [91] [92] [93] . Although it has been suggested, the use of inhaled nitrous oxide (iNO) does not seem to have any preventative effects on the development of PGD.",

Strategies to improve oxygenation are similar to those used for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using low tidal volumes and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Severe dysfunction (PGD Grade 3) may require treatment by decreasing the ventilation-perfusion mismatch with iNO. In addition to improved oxygenation, iNO decreases pulmonary artery pressures and has been shown to decrease the number of days mechanical ventilation is required. Methemoglobinemia is a common side effect of iNO. Prompt identification and treatment with methylene blue is necessary to reverse this complication. Recent and growing data suggests that ECMO should be initiated early (within 24 h) in patients with severe PGD and may be a lifesaving intervention in this subset of patients [92] .",

Arguably, this begins intraoperatively with the stress dosing of steroids administered just prior to perfusion of the new lung.

There is no consensus on whether induction therapy should be routinely used and no conclusive studies supporting one agent over another. Some evidence does suggest a slight increase in survival in the first 2 weeks following transplant based on reports from the ISHLT looking at all transplants done in 2014 [82] . The same registry provides evidence that rejection within the first year may be lower in patients who received induction therapy when compared to no induction therapy (26% vs 34%, respectively) [82] .

            "text": "Lung transplant represents a unique cohort of transplant patients in that the transplanted organ is naturally colonized. This simple fact predisposes the transplanted environment to constant inoculation by bronchial organisms. Utilization of a multidisciplinary approach, involving transplant infectious disease specialist, is recommended. Prophylactic antibiotics that cover for common gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial infections are given prior to incision and typically continued for at least 72 h postoperatively. Cultures should be obtained preoperatively from both the donor and recipient, and both prophylactic and treatment antibiotics should be tailored based on drug resistance data and local antibiograms. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has the added benefit of covering multiple opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii in addition to strep species. A higher instance of multidrug-resistant flora may be seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis specifically pseudomonas and rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria, and treatment should be based on preoperative cultures in these populations [72] . Clinically significant viral infections are rare in the acute postoperative period, but recipients should be provided prophylaxis to the common influenza virus as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV).",
