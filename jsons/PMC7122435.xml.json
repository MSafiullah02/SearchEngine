According to studies of relationship between IAQ and human health conducted in the 1980s, the main indoor air pollutants at that time were fuel combustion products, cooking fumes, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); poor IAQ was associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, the most notable being lung cancer [1\u20135].",

On the one hand, due to the lack and the lax enforcement of regulations and standards for indoor decorating and refurbishing materials, some materials and products containing large amounts of harmful substances have entered the market and then the indoor environments, releasing various pollutants such as formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during and after the decoration and refurbishment. On the other hand, air-conditioning systems have been installed in almost all modern buildings with the improvement of living standards. In order to save energy during the use of air-conditioning, most buildings have been constructed to be tightly sealed, leading to a significantly reduced indoor-outdoor air exchange. As a result, pollutants released from inferior decorating and refurbishing materials build up in indoor air, severely deteriorating the IAQ and thus posing serious hazards to human health. In June 2001, the Beijing Changping District People\u2019s Court judged China\u2019s first damages lawsuit for indoor air pollution. Formaldehyde, in a concentration of 1.56 mg/m3 (surpassing the indicated standard by 19.5 times) in the owner\u2019s bedroom, resulted in the lawsuit.",

As a standard with no mandatory enforcement mechanism, however, GB/T 18883-2002 is not binding for either building developers or renovation contractors. Although GB 50325 \u201cCode for indoor environmental pollution control of civil building engineering\u201d stipulates mandatory acceptance criteria for indoor environmental quality of newly constructed, extended, or renovated civil building engineering, it does not apply to civil buildings delivered to users. Moreover, passing the acceptance inspection required by GB 50325 does not mean or provide assurance for good IAQ during the normal use of civil buildings. On the one hand, inadequate ventilation and/or introduction of new pollution sources such as furniture and chemical household products can increase the indoor pollutant concentrations. On the other hand, many other pollutants besides those included in GB 50325 (radon, formaldehyde, benzene, ammonia, and TVOC) can also deteriorate the IAQ and cause adverse health effects.",

The contents of harmful substances determine the potential of materials (products) to cause indoor air pollution but not the actual indoor air pollution level due to the lack of correlation between the contents and the emission features of harmful substances. As a result, the current labeling system for indoor decorating and refurbishing materials, mainly based on the contents of harmful substances, is not effective enough in guiding the selection of indoor decorating and refurbishing materials to control indoor air pollution at its source, explaining why the IAQ of some newly renovated buildings fails to meet the state standards although all the decorating and refurbishing materials (products) used conform to the corresponding national standards.",

Since filtration and adsorption are the commonly used air cleaning technologies in air cleaners, periodical cleaning and/or replacement of the filtration and adsorption materials are required to ensure the cleaning performance of cleaners. Non-/improperly maintained equipment will lose its cleaning capability or even cause secondary indoor air pollution by releasing trapped pollutants back into the air. At present, however, neither the air cleaner production enterprises nor any special agencies in China provide specialized maintenance service for air cleaners, which absolutely discourages the promotion use of air cleaners and obstructs the development of air cleaner industry.",
