Pneumonitis, if present, usually is mild and patchy, and the inflammatory response is mostly lymphocytic, although alveolar epithelial necrosis also can be evident in sucklings and weanlings. There can be residual lung lesions characterized by tiny scars and lymphoid cell collections, but these are not diagnostically useful because they are similar to residual lesions of various inflammatory causes. In SDAV infection, acute glandular lesions are characterized by diffuse necrosis of the submaxillary salivary gland acini and ducts, with similar changes in the Harderian glands. There also can be multifocal necrotizing inflammation of the parotid gland and infraorbital lacrimal gland, mild multifocal necrotizing cervical lymphadenitis, and mild multifocal thymic necrosis. Resolving lesions in the Harderian gland are characterized by prominent squamous metaplasia. Residual lymphoid collections in the Harderian gland can persist for some time and can be a useful diagnostic clue. In the eye, there is acute keratoconjunctivitis in the early stages, which can resolve or progress to keratitis with ulceration, scarring, and even perforation, in which case there can be secondary bacterial anterior uveitis or panophthalmitis.

The organism can be safely assumed to be either the primary cause or a major contributory pathogen in most cases of chronic respiratory disease in rats and probably mice as well. In acute or epizootic respiratory disease, one should suspect other agents either as the primary cause or, such as in the case of Sendai virus or rat coronaviruses, as a co-pathogen, predisposing the animals to rapid development of mycoplasmal disease. In most cases, M. pulmonis is readily isolated on appropriate mycoplasma medium. Other bacteria can be isolated in cases of respiratory disease in mice and rats, such as Pasteurella pneumotropica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and others. These organisms probably are opportunists or secondary invaders, although it is possible that they could increase disease severity.
