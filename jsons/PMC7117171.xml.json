The genome of PEDV is approximately 30 kb in length. Subgenomic mRNAs of PEDV are transcribed from its genome RNA, and then are translated to produce viral proteins such as spike protein (S, 180\u2013220 kDa), membrane protein (M, 27\u201332 kDa) and nucleocapsid protein (N, 55\u201358 kDa) (Egberink et al., 1988, Holmes, 2001, Brian and Baric, 2005). The S protein, a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface, plays an important role in induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding and cell membrane fusion (Duarte and Laude, 1994, Li et al., 2007, Ma et al., 2005). These properties make the S protein a suitable candidate for genetic engineering of vaccines and diagnostic reagents.",

The anti-S1D antibodies showed neutralizing activity for PEDV-infected Vero cells (Sun et al., 2007a). In order to provide some basis for the development of vaccines and diagnostic reagents, it is necessary to map the antigenic epitopes of the S1D region and accurately determine important residues in these epitopes. In this study, one micropanned epitope region of S1D (MER: residues 696\u2013779) was identified by fd-tet phage display using six monoclonal antibodies (McAbs). Further analysis of the MER was carried out by ELISA, Western blotting and Pepscan using the six McAbs. Two novel B cell epitopes, SS2 (residues 748\u2013755) and SS6 (residues 764\u2013771), were identified in the S protein of PEDV.",

At 3-week intervals two boosters of 50 \u03bcg of purified PEDV emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were administered, and mice were sacrificed 3 days after the last booster inoculation. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using 50% (v/v) of PEG1450 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the fused cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS, HAT medium. Positive hybridoma clones were selected by indirect ELISA using purified S1D protein with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag as coating antigen. The subtype of McAbs secreted by the final hybridoma clones was identified using the SBA Clonotyping\u2122 System/HRP kit (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). Ascites fluid was produced in primed BALB/c mice with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Reactivity of the McAbs with the native S protein was tested by ELISA and Western blotting.

First, one epitope region (MER) was identified on the S1D region of PEDV S protein by phage display. Epitopes could not be determined accurately because the inserts expressed on the surface of the recombinant phages were overlength (approximately 200\u2013300 bp). Second, more accurate identification of the epitopes was performed based on the method described by Hua, and two linear epitopes, S1D5 and S1D6, were determined in the MER (Hua et al., 2004). Antibodies against the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 could react with native S protein of PEDV in ELISA, but the antibodies induced by the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 had no neutralizing activity for PEDV-infected Vero cells. The epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 are 16 amino acids in length and have four overlapping amino acids. Generally, linear epitopes are short stretches of the primary structure of proteins and consist of six to nine or more continuous amino acid residues. The Pepscan method was used to identify core amino acids on epitopes S1D5 and S1D6, the result showed that the core amino acids were located at amino acids 748\u2013755 (SS2) and amino acids 764\u2013771 (SS6), respectively. It was found that epitopes SS2 and SS6 were adjacent to epitope S1P3 (residues 697\u2013742) in the primary structure of S protein. The epitope S1P3 was identified previously by phage display using native antisera against PEDV (Sun et al., 2007b). This result suggests that epitopes SS2, SS6 and S1P3 represent a considerable immunodominant region of PEDV S protein.",

However, the S1 domain (residues 1\u2013789) and the S2 domain (residues 790\u20131383) have been artificially defined by the conserved nonamer and the GxCx motifs at the position of S protein cleavage sites in coronavirus group II members (Follis et al., 2006). Based on bio-informatics analysis of the S protein structure of other coronaviruses, the S1 domain is thought to form the spherical head of the S protein, and is easily accessible to neutralizing antibodies. The S2 domain forms the stem portion and trans-membrane structure of the S protein, and it seldom induces antibodies because of the inaccessibility of this region in intact virions (Holmes, 2001, Wu et al., 2004, De Haan et al., 2006).
