The Herpesviridae family (GenBank TaxID 10292, with 73 completely sequenced virus genomes as of May 2017) includes viruses that infect amniotes; typically, a pair of virus species from this family shares dozens of protein-coding genes recognized by high amino acid sequence similarity (Davison, 2010) . The family Alloherpesviridae (TaxID 548682, 8 completely sequenced genomes) includes viruses of fishes and amphibians.

The third family, Malacoherpesviridae (TaxID 548685), includes two ICTV-approved members, Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) and Haliotid herpesvirus 1 (HaHV-1), which infect bivalve and gastropod molluscs, respectively. In addition to the herpesvirus-like morphology of their virions and capsids, as well as the genomic repeat features, these two viruses were reported to have 39 orthologous genes in common (Savin et al., 2010) , some of which are related to enzymes that play essential roles in other herpesviruses, for example, the large subunit of virus terminase ATPase and family B replicative DNA polymerase. However, no gene products with similarity T to herpesvirus structural proteins have been reported in Malacoherpesviridae. Interestingly, a putative virus related to mollusc herpesviruses has been detected by sequence database searches, among the contigs co-assembled with the portions of the draft genome of a cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (Savin et al., 2010) .

Our results, however, indicate that the base is made of the best-conserved portion of the MCP sequence; indeed, conserved regions 1 and 2, distal in the sequence as they are, come together in the three-dimensional structure to account for almost the entirety of the base (visualized in Additional files 1 and 2). Conservation of these regions in the two families of Herpesvirales suggests that the foundation of the tower domain plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the multidomain MCP and, possibly, its interactions with other virion components. Our efforts to identify a homologous region in Alloherpesviridae, where mass-spectrometry approaches have assigned the major capsid protein role to ORF39 in Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (Davison and Davison, 1995) and to its ortholog ORF104 in Anguillid herpesvirus 1 (Van A. Mushegian et al. Virology 513 (2018) 114-128 Beurden et al., 2011) have produced ambiguous results.

In a targeted PSI-BLAST search initiated by these sequences against all virus proteins in the NR database, capsid proteins from Herpesviridae were detected, but the similarities were not statistically significant. The N-terminal region of MCPs in Herpesviridae was thought to have the HK97-like fold based on low-resolution cryo-EM (Baker et al., 2005; Hui et al., 2013) . Very recently, the atomic structure of the entire MCP of HHV-5 has been determined by cryo-EM to 3.9 \u00c5 resolution, revealing that a modified HK97 fold is present in the structure, but it is assembled in space from several distal segments of the peptide chain. This can be explained as a series of insertions of several very large domains into the loops of the HK97 \"floor\" domain. The relative arrangement of the predicted secondary structure elements along much of the lengths of ORF68 and VP5 homologs is similar (Additional file 3), suggesting structural conservation of multiple domains in these proteins; the structural discontinuity of the HK97 domain helps to understand the difficulties of establishing sequence homology in these regions of herpesvirus MCPs.

In contrast, several essential herpesvirus genome replication factors, such as Family B DNA polymerase and DNA Prim-Pol primase, appear to have an ancient origin and possible ancestral relationship to the hallmark genes of Megavirales, whose structural module is distinct from that of herpesviruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks"}, {"text": "Taken together, this evidence indicates that the ancestors of two orders, Herpesvirales and putative Megavirales, may have recruited their genome propagation module from the same sourcemost likely, from the replication genes in the community of phages and prokaryotic mobile elements. These genes may have been confined to each lineage of eukaryotic viruses ever since; unlike several other enzymes with roles in DNA synthesis in the same virus orders, these essential replication genes do not appear to have been horizontally transferred between these viruses and their hosts, except for occasional integration of the whole virus DNA into the host genome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks"}, {"text": "Also at an early stage, the two emerging virus lineages have acquired distinct morphogenetic modules, i.e., the jelly-roll type in Megavirales and the HK97 type in Herpesvirales. Curiously, the capsid proteins of the former type are relatively narrowly distributed in the known phages, but are found, either in single jelly-roll or in an internally duplicated form, in eukaryotic viruses that infect nearly all major clades of eukaryotes . The latter type of capsid displays the opposite trend, i.e., it is found in many groups of bacterial and archaeal viruses, but among eukaryotic viruses it has been identified in just one order infecting Metazoa. The reasons for these asymmetries and for the association of a specific capsid type with nuclear vs. nucleocytoplasmic replication cycle are unknown. It is quite likely, however, that better sampling of viruses from diverse hosts and from the environment will improve virus phylogeny and provide better understanding of the emergence of the two major lineages of eukaryotic large dsDNA viruses with their distinct replication strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Altschul", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Madden", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Sch\u00e4ffer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Zhang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Zhang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Miller", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Lipman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1997, "venue": "Nucleic Acids Res", "volume": "25", "issn": "", "pages": "3389--3402", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1093/nar/25.17.3389"]}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The MPI bioinformatics Toolkit as an integrative platform for advanced protein sequence and structure analysis", "authors": [{"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Alva", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["Z"], "last": "Nam", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "S\u00f6ding", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["N"], "last": "Lupas", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "Nucleic Acids Res", "volume": "44", "issn": "W1", "pages": "410--415", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1093/nar/gkw348"]}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Common ancestry of herpesviruses A.
