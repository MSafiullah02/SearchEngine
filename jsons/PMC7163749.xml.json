            "text": "Many animal species migrate long distances to track resources or environmental conditions that change seasonally (Johnson and Gaines 1990, Dingle 1996). Despite the pervasiveness of animal migrations and their often spectacular nature, their dynamical consequences for host\u2013parasite interactions remain largely unknown. Long\u2010distance movements could facilitate the geographic spread of pathogens (Henien and Merriam 1990, Riley 2007), including those with human health impacts such as SARS\u2010related coronaviruses in bats (Dobson 2005, Li et al. 2005) and avian influenza viruses in waterfowl and shorebirds (Kilpatrick et al. 2006, Garamszegi and M\u00f8ller 2007). Some modeling studies indicate that host dispersal could facilitate widespread epidemics (Busvine 1993, Hess 1996), whereas others show that host movements can prevent population extinction in the face of a debilitating pathogen and allow host resistance genes to spread (Carlsson\u2010Graner and Thrall 2002, Gog et al. 2002). However, most theory on migration and infectious disease dynamics has focused on undirected, short\u2010distance dispersal, rather than on regular, directed movements that characterize seasonal migration.",

Two mechanisms could cause this association. First, if parasites accumulate in the hosts' environment over time, migration could allow animals to escape from contaminated habitats (\u201cmigratory escape\u201d; Loehle 1995). This mechanism predicts that prolonged use of habitats allows parasite transmission stages to build up in the environment over time, such that migrating animals might therefore leave behind contaminated habitats. Unfavorable environmental conditions, combined with a lack of hosts, could represent a bottleneck for remaining parasites, and hosts returning to these habitats after an extended absence could encounter largely disease\u2010free conditions (Loehle 1995).",

Migration is often energetically demanding or stressful (Alerstam et al. 2003) and could increase susceptibility to parasites through immunosuppression (e.g., Garamszegi and M\u00f8ller 2007, Weber and Stilianakis 2007). Moreover, parasite infections can reduce dispersal ability through reducing flight speed or endurance, as has been shown in monarch butterflies (Bradley and Altizer 2005) and waterfowl (van Gils et al. 2007). Thus, the combined demands of migration and negative effects of parasites could remove infected animals from the population, reducing parasite prevalence.",

Monarchs occur worldwide and populations vary widely in migratory behaviors. Here we focus on the eastern North American monarch population, which migrates annually to Mexico. Because this migration is similar in timing, duration, and distance to that of many other migratory animals, this host\u2013pathogen system represents a relevant model to ask how seasonal migration impacts infectious disease dynamics. We test the following predictions: (1) Parasite prevalence increases from early to late in the breeding season, possibly as a result of increasing parasite transmission associated with sequential host generations on the same breeding grounds, consistent with the migratory escape hypothesis. (2) Parasite prevalence decreases as monarchs progress southward during their fall migration, with the lowest prevalence expected at Mexican overwintering sites as compared to breeding areas, consistent with the migratory culling hypothesis.",

A second monarch population in western North America migrates a shorter distance to overwinter along the California coast (Nagano et al. 1993).

Larvae ingest the spores, parasites replicate within larval and pupal tissues, and butterflies emerge with dormant spores on the outsides of their bodies (McLaughlin and Myers 1970, Leong et al. 1997b\n). Parasites can be transferred vertically, from infected adults to their progeny, and horizontally, when butterflies scatter spores that are ingested by unrelated larvae (Altizer et al. 2004, De Roode et al. 2009). Larva\u2010to\u2010larva transmission does not occur (Leong et al. 1997b\n). Parasites occur in all monarch populations examined to date (Leong et al. 1997a\n, Altizer et al. 2000). Previous work showed that infection levels were highest in southern Florida where monarchs breed year\u2010round, whereas monarchs from the eastern and western migratory populations in North America were less heavily infected (Altizer et al. 2000).",

From 2006 to 2009, we collected adults at two points along the east coast fall migratory flyway (e.g., Howard and Davis 2009): Athens, Georgia, USA and St. Marks, Florida, USA. In 2009, we added samples from a more northern location at Cape May, New Jersey, USA (Appendices A and B). Samples collected between 15 September and 10 November were assumed to be fall migrants and were included in analyses. We also sampled wild adults collected at overwintering sites in central Mexico in January 2007, February 2008, and February 2009 (Appendix A). We used a nondestructive method to assess individual infection status based on samples from adult abdomens (Altizer et al. 2000). Samples with more than 100 spores (counted at 50\u00d7) were considered to be heavily infected; this classification includes the two highest spore load categories defined by Altizer et al. (2000). We limited the data analysis to monarchs with more than 100 spores, as these reflect active parasite infections caused by the ingestion of spores by larvae; in contrast, lower spore numbers can occur as a result of passive transfer of spores between adult butterflies (Altizer et al. 2004, De Roode et al. 2007, 2009).",

Samples are returned to our laboratory and scored for the presence/absence of infection based on the presence of >100 parasite spores per sample (protocols for this program are available online).5 Across all years (2006\u20132009), a total of 124 MH volunteers returned 5470 parasite samples from 23 states and two Canadian provinces (Appendix B).

Gulf coastal regions of southern Florida, Louisiana, and Texas below 30\u00b0 N latitude were not included in our analyses, as monarchs in these locations could breed year\u2010round and thus may be nonmigratory. We further classified observations into three time intervals within each year, hereafter called breeding phases: early (15 April\u201330 June), middle (1 July\u201314 August), and late (15 August\u201331 October). Within each phase and region, we estimated average parasite prevalence from MH data, and calculated average weekly monarch density (number of larvae reported/milkweed stalks examined) from MLMP data (SAS Institute 2004; PROC SQL). Because MH samples were collected from adults and MLMP density estimates were based on observations of larvae, we corrected for the time lag in host development by adding two weeks to the date of larval density estimates before assigning breeding\u2010phase classifications (assuming that monarchs require approximately 14 days to develop from mid\u2010 or late\u2010instar larvae to adults under average summer temperatures; Zalucki 1982).",

Differences in larval density (MLMP) were assessed using analysis of variance for main effects and two\u2010way interactions of region, year, and breeding phase (SAS, PROC GLM). To be conservative, our response variable was average weekly density for each region\u2013phase combination, and we weighted models by sample size to account for variation in the number of MLMP volunteers reporting data from each region\u2013phase combination. To examine how changes in parasite prevalence covaried with host density, we used a generalized linear model with binomial errors and a built\u2010in temporal autocorrelation function combining data from MH and MLMP data sets (SAS, PROC GLIMMIX). Specifically, we assumed that both prevalence and density estimates followed a time\u2010decaying covariance process, so that correlations within each variable decreased linearly over time by using the RANDOM statement with a first\u2010order autoregressive process. Lastly, we fit linear regressions to the relationship between parasite prevalence (MH) and host density (MLMP) within each region separately.

Logistic regression analysis of the full model showed statistically significant main effects of phase (late breeding phase vs. overwintering; Wald \u03c72 = 14.057, df = 1, P = 0.001) and year (Wald \u03c72 = 84.711, df = 2, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction between year and phase (Wald \u03c72 = 21.143, df = 2, P < 0.001), on parasite prevalence.

Across the eastern North American breeding range, parasite prevalence was lowest at the start of the breeding season and peaked in late summer/early fall, just prior to the fall migration. This pattern is consistent with predictions of migratory escape, whereby infections increase with more intense use and longer residency in a given habitat (Loehle 1995).

Thus, larvae could ingest spores deposited by their own parents, or by unrelated adults. Moreover, OE spores can persist for years in a laboratory environment (S. M. Altizer, unpublished data), and ingestion of even a single spore can cause heavy infections in adult butterflies (De Roode et al. 2007). These factors could cause rapid increases in infection among monarchs that use the same milkweed patches in multiple overlapping generations. Consistent with this idea, field\u2010collected milkweed host plants from southern Florida (where monarchs breed year round) caused high rates of infection when fed to previously unexposed larvae (indicating high spore densities), whereas field cuttings of milkweed from Minnesota and Wisconsin, where monarchs had bred for only two generations, caused low infection rates (Altizer et al. 2004).",

Because density is reported on a per\u2010milkweed\u2010stalk basis, it is possible that areas with less abundant milkweed could have high numbers of larvae per stalk, independent of the region\u2010wide abundance of monarchs.

Because OE infection causes reduced adult body size, shorter adult life span (De Roode et al. 2007, 2008), and reduced flight performance (Bradley and Altizer 2005), we expect that a high proportion of heavily infected monarchs will be removed from the population during long\u2010distance migrations. Our results here showed that parasite prevalence decreased as monarchs moved southward along the east coast during their annual fall migrations, consistent with the idea that infected animals were less able to reach the southernmost sites. Moreover, prevalence among eastern adults sampled at the end of the breeding season was greater than for overwintering monarchs sampled after they successfully reached Mexico. It is important to note that at overwintering sites, little to no population recruitment occurs, and hence no vertical transmission. Instead, parasite prevalence can decline further as a result of mortality of infected hosts (Altizer et al. 2000). Previous work detected differences in the prevalence of heavily infected adults during breeding, migration, and overwintering periods in western, but not in eastern, North America (Altizer et al. 2000). Here, we provide a more detailed analysis of a longer\u2010term and more spatially complete data set for eastern migratory monarchs.",

Simmons and Rogers (1991) demonstrated that armyworms infected by an ectoparasitic nematode had compromised migratory ability, such that males recolonizing sites as they return north contained few or no nematodes. Recent work on Bewick's Swans also showed that low\u2010pathogenic avian influenza viruses delayed migration and reduced travel distances (van Gils et al. 2007). Because migration is energetically demanding or stressful (Alerstam et al. 2003), long\u2010distance movements have been proposed to increase susceptibility to parasites through immunosuppression. Evidence includes increased susceptibility to low\u2010pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses (Garamszegi and M\u00f8ller 2007, Weber and Stilianakis 2007) and relapses of Lyme disease spirochetes (Gylfe et al. 2000) in migratory birds. In cases where hosts harbor latent infections and the physiological stress of migration causes those infections to erupt, this could ultimately remove infected hosts and lower the prevalence of disease, as animals with severe infections most likely do not migrate successfully.",

By comparison, the prevalence of infected adults in nonmigratory monarchs from southern Florida has been consistently high (70\u201395%) over the past 15 years (Altizer et. al 2000; S. M. Altizer, unpublished data). Nonmigratory monarch populations may experience higher rates of both horizontal and vertical transmission due to interacting effects of continuous breeding activity and extended use of the same host plants for egg deposition (Altizer et al. 2004).

In monarchs, threats to the population include deforestation of overwintering grounds (Brower et al. 2004), loss of critical habitat across the breeding range, and climate change (Oberhauser and Peterson 2003, Batalden et al. 2007). Collectively, these have caused the monarchs' annual migration to be considered a \u201cthreatened phenomenon\u201d (Brower and Malcolm 1991). At the same time, local pockets of winter\u2010breeding monarchs have appeared sporadically along the Gulf coast and the southern Atlantic coast in recent years (Howard et al., in press\n), possibly owing to mild climates and the planting of tropical milkweeds that produce vegetation year\u2010round.

Migratory vertebrates such as birds, salmon, and antelope (Wilcove and Wikelski 2008) have all suffered severe and often sustained population declines and reductions in movement. It is possible that the \u201cfading glory\u201d of animal migrations (Wilcove and Wikelski 2008) will affect host\u2013parasite interactions across a broad range of taxa, in some cases presenting additional risks for migratory populations. Pathogen\u2010driven wildlife declines and extinction are increasingly evident (for a comprehensive review, see de Castro and Bolker 2005).
