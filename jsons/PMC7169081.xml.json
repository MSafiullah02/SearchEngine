Healthy humans have no serological evidence of past SARS\u2010CoV infection. Closely related viruses have recently been isolated from animals such as civet cats.\n9\n It is probable that SARS\u2010CoV was an animal virus that adapted to human\u2010human transmission in the recent past. The presence of this animal reservoir implies that it is possible for this virus to again cross into humans and initiate outbreaks of disease in the future. Many respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses have a seasonality and that of SARS\u2010CoV is yet unknown. It is therefore possible that, similar to other coronaviruses, winter may be more conducive to the transmission of SARS\u2010CoV.",

The infection is thus not restricted to the respiratory tract alone and the presence of diarrhoea in a proportion of patients is one indication of this fact. In contrast to most other respiratory viruses, SARS\u2010CoV viral load in the respiratory tract and faeces is low in the first few days of the illness but peaks around day 11 of the disease.\n4\n, \n5\n This accounts for the low sensitivity of the first generation diagnostic tests in the first few days of illness. It may also explain in part the unusual predilection of this virus to spread among health care workers, as patients are usually most infectious later in the illness by which time many of them are already hospitalized.",

Despite these limitations on autopsy material, it has been possible to determine that there are two phases of SARS pneumonia.\n11\n, \n12\n Within the first 10 days the histological picture is that of acute phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with a mixture of inflammatory infiltrate, oedema and hyaline membrane formation (Fig. 1). Desquamation of pneumocytes is prominent and consistent. One report initially published in Chinese\n13\n but later in English in another journal\n14\n mentioned viral intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies but these were not identified in the Hong Kong or Singapore cases.\n11\n, \n12\n After 10 days of illness the picture changes to one of organizing DAD with increased fibrosis, squamous metaplasia and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 2).\n11\n, \n12\n, \n15\n The giant cells that have also been seen in the experimentally induced SARS pneumonia in primates and coronaviruses are known to give rise to syncitia.\n16\n Histologically, the appearance is not distinctive enough to make a diagnosis without viral detection.

This lymphopenia is a consistent finding in the majority of SARS cases and may be similar in aetiology to influenza\u2010induced leukopenia.\n17\n The primate study also found increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and this was also present in our single early case of SARS. In influenza this has been explained by chemokines stimulated by influenza preferentially recruiting blood mononuclear cells to the site of infection (reviewed in \n18\n). In the normal lung AM are supposed to be a developmental end\u2010point stage of monocytes while INT macrophages represent a precursor stage. The two also differ in their function\u2014AM are effective as non\u2010specific first\u2010line defence against infectious agents whereas INT macrophages cooperate with interstitial lymphocytes in inducing a specific immune response.",

If SARS\u2010CoV is similar to other CoV infections where there is early clearance of the virus by day 9, a period similar to the exudative phase of SARS DAD, the findings suggest that the first phase of the disease is cell damage with macrophage and T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration. The second stage is the organizing fibrotic DAD aggravated by mechanical ventilation, in which cytokines play a minor role and only small quantities of virus are still present in lung tissues. Further studies in the primate model may elucidate the pathogenesis of the lung damage and provide a better foundation for patient management.",
