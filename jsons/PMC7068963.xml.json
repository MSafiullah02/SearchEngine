            "text": "Diaphragm dysfunction during mechanical ventilation is increasingly recognized as a clinical entity which has an impact on important clinical outcomes, such as the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation, re-intubation, tracheostomy, and death [1]. Ultrasound (US) is becoming a reference to assess diaphragmatic injury and to detect changes in diaphragmatic thickness over time; both an increase and a decrease of diaphragmatic thickness are associated with diaphragm activity and ventilation outcome [1, 2]. Starting from experimental and clinical studies, four mechanisms of diaphragmatic injury (myotrauma) have been identified: disuse atrophy due to over-assistance [3], excessive load due to under-assistance [1, 4], eccentric myotrauma from diaphragm contraction during expiration [5] or asynchronies, and longitudinal atrophy, due to high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [6]. Therefore, the need to set \u201cprotective\u201d mechanical ventilation not only for the lungs but also for the diaphragm was recently advocated [7]. The targets of this type of ventilation would be to avoid excessive or minimal diaphragm activity, trying to mimic the inspiratory effort of healthy subjects [8]. In fact, a diaphragmatic thickening fraction between 25 and 40% (considered the reference range for resting tidal breathing) was associated with stable diaphragmatic thickness [2], shorter duration of mechanical ventilation [1], and higher incidence of weaning success [9]. Given all of these, it is advisable to strictly monitor patients\u2019 inspiratory efforts, and specifically diaphragmatic function, while avoiding lung injury [10].",

            "text": "Some clinical studies showed that intermittent diaphragm stimulation during cardiothoracic surgery could exert benefits on diaphragmatic force generation and mitochondrial function [11, 12]. On the other side, experimental studies showed that the mode of ventilation could influence the degree of diaphragmatic dysfunction. In healthy rats, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) lead to proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis, while the same period spent under pressure support ventilation (PSV) preserved diaphragmatic protein content, with no increase in oxidative injury [13]. In another animal study, assisted mechanical ventilation (AMV) prevented atrophy and loss of diaphragmatic force caused by controlled ventilation [14]. Recently, the first study conducted on humans (two groups of organ donors as study groups and thoracic surgery patients as controls) was published showing a correlation between the severity of diaphragm histological damage and the mode of ventilation used. In particular, the duration of the period without diaphragm stimuli (i.e. CMV) correlated with a decreased cross-sectional area of the fibres in both study groups compared to controls [15]. One of the two study groups underwent a longer period of CMV than the other organ donors group, but this did not lead to a significant reduction in diaphragm fibre cross-sectional area. The same group spent more time also under an assisted mode of ventilation, with some preservation of diaphragmatic function, and this was advocated as the possible mechanism which avoided excessive atrophy.",

Glasgow Coma Scale was not taken into account during the computation of SOFA. Some derived data were computed to describe patients\u2019 respiratory mechanics. Driving pressure was computed as the difference between plateau pressure (measured during an inspiratory hold, both in CMV and AMV, as previously described by our group [10, 18]) and PEEP. Respiratory system compliance was calculated as tidal volume divided by driving pressure. Pressure Muscle Index (PMI) is the difference between plateau pressure and peak pressure (the latter being the sum of pressure support and PEEP) during PSV and was previously shown to correlate with the effort exerted by patients\u2019 muscle during inspiration [19]. Lastly, Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI) is the product between tidal volume and respiratory rate, and it is used to evaluate weaning readiness [20]. p0.1 [21], the drop in pressure in the first 100 ms of an inspiratory effort against occluded airways and an index of respiratory drive, automatically measured by the mechanical ventilators, was collected together with the other ventilator data during AMV.",

The zone of apposition of the diaphragm between the liver and chest wall was identified. The first ultrasound image of diaphragm was collected at the end of expiration in two-dimensional (2D) mode (Additional file 1: Figure S1A ).

The median TFdi of the patient population during the first 8 US measurements in AMV was 16.3% [IQR 8.9, 24.6]. The patients with a mean TFdi higher than 16.3% had a higher incidence of ARDS as admission diagnosis (54% had ARDS at admission versus 16% in the group whose mean TFdi was < 16.3%, p < 0.005). The median of the maximum TFdi recorded for each patient during the first 8 US measurements during AMV was 25% [IQR 14, 35]. We then classified the patients in tertiles of mean TFdi during the same period of AMV (corresponding to the first 8 US measurements): despite the differences between the groups were not significant, we found that with the increase in mean TFdi, the AMV days (so the weaning duration) increased, together with ICU length of stay (Additional file 1: Figure S3).",

This lead to discarding 18% of the TFdi measurement that were judged to be unreliable. Secondarily, the multicentre nature of this study leads to a higher population heterogeneity. Third, the population suffers from a selection bias, which was however wanted by the investigators, in order to focus on those patients who are considered able to be weaned (so switched from CMV to AMV). This explains the high survival rate observed in this ICU population. Forth, we acknowledge that we performed a high number of statistical analysis, which could lead to associations difficult to interpret, even if we repeated most of the analysis already performed in previous studies [2].",
