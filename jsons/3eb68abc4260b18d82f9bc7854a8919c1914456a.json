Healthcare systems around the world are trying to simultaneously treat patients with COVID-19 infection, prepare for its long-term impacts, and manage patients with other acute and chronic diseases. There are multiple ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly affect patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly given their common risk factors for poor outcomes. Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities. The purpose of this review is to summarize how COVID-19 has impacted key components of the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD as well as to provide strategies to mitigate these challenges. We further review major obstacles for researchers and identify priority areas for future ILD research related to COVID-19. Our goals are to provide practical considerations to support the care of patients with ILD during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a road map for clinicians caring for these patients during future infectious disease outbreaks.",

There is rationing of healthcare resources such as coronavirus test kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) in many health regions. Healthcare for all patients has been affected, including decreased access to primary care and specialist physicians, as well as limited access to investigations, procedures, and elective surgeries. Lack of access to critical resources, most notably ventilators, has directly contributed to patient deaths. 1 COVID-19 has similarly impacted all aspects of care for patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), including essential components of the diagnostic process and further implications on the initiation, maintenance, and monitoring of ILD therapy. The objective of this review is to discuss practical considerations for the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a secondary purpose to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical and translational research activities. This is a rapidly evolving situation, with limited evidence to guide specific recommendations. We therefore focused on general practical considerations, with the intent that these apply to healthcare settings with substantial risk of community spread and will be modified as further evidence on COVID-19 is generated.",

The median delay in diagnosis from symptom onset is typically over one year, 3,4 which will likely worsen with reduced access to diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In areas with confirmed or anticipated community spread of COVID-19, it is appropriate to minimize in-person contact between healthcare workers and patients for each component of an initial ILD assessment. For example, patients should obtain bloodwork at outpatient labs during off-peak hours, make online reservations to minimize time in the waiting room, and use mobile lab services, if available. Most hospital labs have closed or reduced access for outpatients, and are best avoided if there is a feasible alternative. PFTs have a higher risk of spreading infection to both patients and healthcare workers compared to many diagnostic tests, and most PFT labs have therefore restricted access. PFTs are likely still appropriate in some situations, but it is essential to ensure that the results of a PFT will impact patient management and include only the components required (e.g., spirometry or DLCO only). 5 For example, if all surgeries, including lung cancer resection, have been postponed due to critical resource constraints, then postponing a presurgical PFT would be justified. Routine PFTs in patients with symptomatically stable disease are not appropriate in regions with a high community burden of COVID-19 infection. Imaging studies should similarly only be performed when these are needed to inform short-term management decisions.",

Ideally, this assessment is based on a virtual multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) that specifically considers whether the result of this test is expected to impact short-term management decisions. 6 If a patient already has a confident diagnosis (>90% certainty), then further testing is unlikely to alter management decisions and should therefore not be pursued. In patients with a provisional diagnosis (50-89% certainty), it is sometimes appropriate to pursue additional investigations; however, this threshold has likely shifted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it may be appropriate to observe or consider empiric treatment for such patients with a working diagnosis. In such patients, it is important to ensure an appropriate diagnostic confidence has been reached and to complete necessary additional studies if required after the COVID-19 pandemic resolves. Patients with an uncertain diagnosis (< 50% certainty) could either be observed if stable, empirically treated, or considered for more invasive diagnostic procedures if available and urgently required for important short-term therapeutic decisions.",

There are several known risk factors for poor outcomes following invasive procedures, 7,8 particularly for SLB. These risks are likely amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a shift in the safety threshold for some of these procedures. For example, SLB is typically not pursued in patients >75 years old, 7 but a younger age threshold may now be more appropriate given the more dramatic association of increased age with poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection. 9, 10 There is also a risk of healthcare workers being exposed to infectious patients during these aerosol-generating medical procedures, which is of particular concern given demonstration of viral transmission when patients have mild or no symptoms. [11] [12] [13] Given these risks, most regions with community spread of COVID-19 have limited both bronchoscopy and SLB to patients who require performance of these tests within the next 4-12 weeks.",

There is no evidence that antifibrotic therapies (nintedanib and pirfenidone) impact the risk or severity of COVID-19 infection. However, there is overlap between adverse effects of these medications and symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite), which can confound early identification and lead to worse manifestations of COVID-19. In addition, many regions have criteria for medication coverage or reimbursement that include PFT values (e.g., FVC > 50%) and/or confirmation of an IPF diagnosis via MDD, which were major inclusion criteria in previous clinical trials. [24] [25] [26] The current difficulty in obtaining PFTs and conducting MDDs in places with a high burden of COVID-19 will limit fulfillment of these criteria. Some health authorities have consequently modified eligibility, forgoing or extending deadlines for completion of PFTs and allowing alternative methods of diagnostic confirmation. This approach is supported by the consistent benefits of antifibrotic therapy across severities of IPF and in patients with non-IPF fibrotic ILD, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] suggesting temporary loosening of previous criteria may be preferable to restricting medication access.",

The risks of delayed virus clearance, secondary infections, and drug interactions will lead to temporary discontinuation of other immunomodulatory therapies in most patients during acute COVID-19",

Research centres in areas with a high burden of community spread of COVID-19 are no longer opening new clinical trials, while ongoing trials are adapting to ensure patient safety while attempting to maintain trial integrity. As with clinical care, the major change is movement to virtual study assessments and suspension of non-critical efficacy testing that requires in-person patient contact with the healthcare system. Most study sponsors have provided clear protocol modifications to maintain consistency across study sites and indicate the priority of patient safety. As a result, most studies are no longer enrolling new patients, limiting access to novel therapies that are only available through clinical trials. This will also delay completion of clinical trials and slow translation of findings into the clinical setting.

In particular, there is uncertain significance of the ACE-2 receptor and the role of ACE inhibitors in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. 52, 53 The ACE-2 receptor appears to be protective against some types of pulmonary fibrosis, 54 but is also used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. Considering these effects, it is unknown if ACE-2 receptors impact susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in ILD, and whether this susceptibility might be different across ILD subtypes (e.g., sarcoidosis) or genetic/racial backgrounds.

From the standpoint of the recipient, there are significant risks including the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection in the post-operative period and reduced access to essential monitoring of post-transplant blood work, spirometry, and bronchoscopy. From the perspective of healthcare systems, lung transplants utilize critical healthcare resources such as operating room time, critical care beds, PPE and healthcare worker time. For these reasons, many programs are choosing to postpone all but the most urgent transplants.",
