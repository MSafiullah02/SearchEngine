Data collected included: demographics, admission date, clinical characteristics, HIV status, CD4+ T-cell count, laboratory investigations, concurrent opportunistic infections (OIs), treatment, and hospital outcome. P. marneffei was cultured from clinical specimens according to standard culture techniques [7]. For seasonality analysis, we assessed the number of penicilliosis admissions during dry versus rainy months in relation to all HIV-related admissions identified from hospital records. For outcome analysis three variables were used: 1. Survival including clinical improvement, defined as regression of symptoms such as fever, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, or resolution; 2. death at hospital discharge; 3. Lost to follow up due to that the patient were taken home or referred to another health facility and could not be contacted. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regressions using forward stepwise selection of predictor variables. Statistically significant results (p < 0.05) from the univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model where continuous variables were dichotomized based on the mean values and after exclusion of correlated variables. The analysis was performed using Statistics Package of Social Sciences (SPSS version 19, USA).",

However as NHTD is a specialized tertiary hospital, and most (82%) of the cases were referred, and because other epidemiological data were lacking, it cannot be concluded that there is a difference in disease prevalence between northern and southern Vietnam. The clinical features of disseminated penicillosis are consistent with other studies including profound immunosuppression (median CD4+ T-cell count: 24 cells/\u03bcl) and high rate of co-infections with other opportunistic pathogens [2,4,6]. One third of the patients were already on ART for in average 10 days, this indicates that many patients had an ongoing P. marneffei infection that was not revealed before initiation of ART, but was probably unmasked by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART, this has earlier been reported in a few case studies [8,9].",

Of the six patients that had dyspnea and died no one had tuberculosis or Pneumocystis jiroveci diagnosis, however two had septicemia. This may indicate that pulmonary involvement (i.e. P. marneffei pneumonia) drives disease severity or that the disease severity result in pulmonary lesions. This is consistent with a prior study showing that high respiratory rates and dyspnea among penicilliosis patients predicted poor hospital outcome [4]. Of the 11 patients with dyspnea 5 also had lung lesions, of these one was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci and non with tuberculosis. Lung involvement of P. marneffei has been shown in Taiwan where it was found to be the most common cause of cavities in the lungs of immunosuppressed HIV infected patients [10]. The majority of patients with dyspnea did not have lung lesions, hence the dyspnea might be due to the severe condition with multi-organ involvement and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It should be noted that there could be some under diagnosis of tuberculosis due to the poor sensitivity for sputum microcopy and culture in immunosuppressed individuals as well as for Pneumocystis jiroveci as microscopy of sputum, obtained by nebulizer or bronchoscopy, is not routinely performed.",

Although a previous study showed that presence of typical skin lesions facilitates early initiation of empirical antifungal treatment and results in better outcome [4], it is unclear whether skin involvement itself is a prognostic marker. In the absence of skin lesions, the differential diagnoses for an AIDS-associated febrile illness with reticuloendothelial system involvement are broad and include: Mycobacterium tuberculosisMycobacterium Avium Complex, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis among others [11]. This poses a major challenge in diagnosis and treatment, especially in areas with poor access to blood culture and other diagnostic laboratory. Penicilliosis should be considered in all severely immunosuppressed HIV patients with one or more of the common presentations, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, jaundice and dyspnoea, who have been in P. marneffei endemic areas, and empirical antifungal treatment in very ill patients may be indicated.",

Tuberculosis and penicilliosis co-infection poses a major therapeutic dilemma in resource-poor settings as rifampicin is a potent P450 inducer and markedly reduces itraconazole concentrations [12] Amphotericin B is recommended for patients with concurrent tuberculosis treatment. An alternative tuberculosis drug rifabutin is not available in most penicilliosis endemic areas.",

Although itraconazole is a recommended alternative treatment for mild to moderate disease or when amphotericin B is unavailable [13], in Vietnam both mild and severe cases are commonly treated with oral itraconazole because amphotericin B is often not available or is too expensive. In our study there was no significant difference between itraconazole and amphotericin B in treatment outcome. So far no randomized, prospective treatment trials have been conducted to compare the efficacy of different antifungal treatment regimens for penicilliosis.",
