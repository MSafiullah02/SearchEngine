Furthermore, the subsequent generation of hydrogen peroxide within these endosomes leads to an oxidation of Cys98 on TLR7 that blocks the ability of this receptor to transmit a signal boosting type 1 interferon production. In macrophages deficient in NOX2 activity, either genetically or owing to administration of a targeted NOX2 inhibitor (gp91ds-TAT), the production of type 1 interferon was markedly higher in response to RNA virus infection. When genetically normal or NOX2 knockout mice were exposed to an inactive strain of influenza virus, the interferon-beta response and the antibody response evoked by this virus were markedly higher in the NOX2 knockout mice.",

The low nanomolar intracellular concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin generated by activation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are known to inhibit NOX2-depending NADPH oxidase activity; this likely is a key homeostatic mission of HO-1.3\n,\n4 Moreover, biliverdin \u2013 the HO-1 product which is converted rapidly to bilirubin within cells \u2013 has been reported to boost the type 1 interferon response to hepatitis C RNA virus in hepatocyte cell lines.5 Furthermore, HO-1 induction is reported to potentiate the type 1 interferon response to influenza virus.6 Phase 2-inductive nutraceuticals \u2013 such as ferulic acid, lipoic acid, or sulforaphane \u2013 are known to promote induction of HO-1, and hence may have some utility for boosting type 1 interferon response.7., 8., 9. The ability of sodium ferulate to activate TLR7, stimulate type 1 interferon production, and enhance survival in influenza A-infected mice, might be secondary to HO-1 induction, and possibly reflects an additional effect of ferulate per se (as TLR9 was also found to be activated).10\n",

In a little-noticed 6-month controlled clinical study enrolling 262 primarily elderly subjects, those receiving 600 mg NAC twice daily, as opposed to those receiving placebo, experienced significantly fewer influenza-like episodes and days of bed confinement.19 Although the rate of seroconversion to influenza A was comparable in the two groups \u2013 indicating that they were exposed at the same frequency \u2013 only 25% of the virus-infected subjects in the NAC group developed symptoms, as contrasted to 79% of those of placebo. (Given the carnage that influenza wreaks among the elderly, it is most regrettable that no effort has been made to replicate this study, conducted over 20 years ago.) The particular utility of NAC in the elderly might reflect the fact that plasma cysteine levels and cellular glutathione levels tend to decline with advancing age.20\n",

Duan and colleagues have recently shown that RNA virus infection promotes O-GlcNacylation of MAVS on multiple sites, and that this renders MAVS susceptible to the K63-linked ubiquitination that enables it to activate IRF3.29 Moreover, they show that, the more extensive this O-GlcNacylation is, the more effectively MAVS is activated. Hence, they are able to demonstrate that measures which suppress or amplify the cellular pool of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine \u2013 the substrate for O-GlcNacylation \u2013 correspondingly suppress or amplify the activation of MAVS. They then proceed to demonstrate that feeding mice a glucosamine-enriched diet (2.5% by weight) markedly enhances the survival of wild-type mice infected with influenza virus, whereas this provided no protection in mice in which MAVS, type 1 interferons, or O-GlcNac transferase (the mediator of O-GlcNacylation) were genetically absent.",

Insurance of good zinc status, particularly in the very young and the elderly, would likewise seem to be prudent, as zinc supports the effective function and proliferation of various immune cells.23\n,\n35 This effect might be pertinent to the significant 27% reduction in total mortality observed in elderly subjects who received high-dose zinc in the AREDS1 multicenter trial.36 And it should be acknowledged that certain herbal preparations have shown potential for controlling or mitigating the symptoms of infections with influenza and other RNA viruses, for reasons that remain obscure37; extracts of elderberry, in particular, have received considerable clinical evaluation, and have been found to be symptomatically beneficial in influenza and the common cold.38 Given that elderberry is a very rich source of anthocyanins, there is reason to suspect that its impact on viruses might be mediated, at least in part, by ferulic acid, a prominent metabolite that appears in plasma following anthocyanin ingestion.39 Careful research evaluation of the most promising of these preparations may reveal specific phytochemicals which can influence the pathogenicity of viruses by addressing novel targets.",
