When combined with respiratory burns, the airway mucosa is damaged, and throat edema increases the possibility of asphyxia. Early treatment often requires endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy, and if necessary, ventilator-assisted breathing. In the process of endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy, healthcare worker must have come into contact with the patient\u2019s respiratory droplets. However, droplet transmission is the main mode of transmission of COVID-19. After endotracheal intubation or tracheal intubation, sputum aspiration and other related operations are easy routes to contact aerosols. In our study, 18.93% (32/169) of severely burned patients underwent endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy. Because most of the patients with severe burns are treated in the burns ICU, the more difficult tracheotomy is undertaken at the bedside. Compared with the operating conditions and equipment in the operating room, bedside procedures are deficient in terms of safety protocols, and the neck of patients often has tissue edema, which necessitates longer tracheostomy times than in normal procedures. The risk of exposure to infection is thus increased. Therefore, the establishment of endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy is the highest risk-exposure point for COVID-19 infection in the early treatment of burn patients.",

Early treatment requires topical drugs and wound dressings. This procedure will be performed every 2\u20133 days until the wound is completely closed. And the time of wound treatment was positively correlated with the size of burn wounds. In our study, 100% (169/169) of the patients underwent wound management. Early burn escharectomy and skin grafting are also common operations for burn patients. When general anesthesia with tracheal intubation is needed, medical staff come into contact not only with patients, but also with patients' respiratory droplets and aerosols. In our study, 63.31%% (107/169) patients underwent surgical treatment within 14 days after injury, of which 82.24% (88/107) underwent general anesthesia through tracheal intubation. In the process of wound treatment and operation, healthcare worker would not only operate in a relatively closed environment, but also closely experience contact with the patient's body fluids, droplets, and aerosols. In the process of wound treatment and operation, healthcare worker not only need to operate in a relatively closed environment, but also closely contact with the patient's body fluids. Both intimate contact with patients' body fluids and long-time exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment are routes of transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, the process of wound treatment and surgery is the highest risk point of COVID-19 infection exposure in the early treatment of burn patients.",
