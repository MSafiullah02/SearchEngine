            "text": "Riley oxidation of advanced heterocyclic intermediates (dihydrodipyrrins and tetrahydrodipyrrins) is pivotal in routes to synthetic hydroporphyrins including chlorins, bacteriochlorins, and model (bacterio)chlorophylls. Such macrocycles find wide use in studies ranging from energy sciences to photomedicine. The key transformation (-CH 3 \u2192 -CHO) is often inefficient, however, thereby crimping the synthesis of hydroporphyrins. The first part of the review summarizes 12 representative conditions for Riley oxidation across diverse (non-hydrodipyrrin) substrates. An interlude summarizes the proposed mechanisms and provides context concerning the nature of various selenium species other than SeO 2 . The second part of the review comprehensively reports the conditions and results upon Riley oxidation of 45 1-methyltetrahydrodipyrrins and 1-methyldihydrodipyrrins. A comparison of the results provides insights into the tolerable structural features for Riley oxidation of hydrodipyrrins. In general, Riley oxidation of dihydrodipyrrins has a broad scope toward substituents, but proceeds in only modest yield. Too few tetrahydrodipyrrins have been examined to draw conclusions concerning scope. New reaction conditions or approaches will be required to achieve high yields for this critical transformation in the synthesis of hydroporphyrins.",

On account of the rate-accelerating effect of pyridine and perhaps also the limited stability of dihydrodipyrrins under acidic conditions [17, 26] , pyridine was added to the Riley oxidation of a set of dihydrodipyrrins. Thus, dihydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde 24 afforded the dihydrodipyrrin-dicarboxaldehyde 6 in 61%-71% yield, and increased the yield for the conversion of 25 to 26 to 37% (Scheme 4, top). For those substrates with acid-labile groups, only a few oxidations were successful [27, 28] . The reaction of 27 with SeO2 gave a mixture of compounds (28-32) owing to hydrolysis of the ketal (Scheme 4, middle). However, the addition of a slight stoichiometric excess of pyridine with respect to the SeO2 resulted in the isolation of 28 as a major product in 42% yield (Scheme 4, bottom) [29] . Scheme 4.

The role of selenium oxides as oxidants of organic compounds was apparently surmised in the late 19th century owing to the presence of the congeneric selenium oxide as an impurity in fuming sulfuric acid [10] , yet it was the systematic studies of Riley and coworkers with purified SeO 2 that captured the imagination of synthetic chemists. The impact was torrential-at least 10 overviews and summaries appeared in the ensuing dozen years [11] , and a chapter in Organic Reactions (1948) listed >500 distinct substrates that had been subjected to reaction with SeO 2 [10] -all of which highlight the unmet needs for synthetic transformations that were fulfilled by the advent of SeO 2 -mediated oxidation. Riley oxidation has found enduring use with application to diverse substrates, as recounted in broad-ranging reviews [10] [11] [12] [13] . Our focus here is to comprehensively review the use of Riley oxidation in a key transformation leading to synthetic analogues of the native photosynthetic pigments. The scope of this targeted review covers the totality of all work on this topic since inception, which was in 2001.",

The Riley oxidation of a 1-methyldihydrodipyrrin (13) affords the dihydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde (14) , which upon Knoevenagel condensation with a \u03b2-ketoester-substituted dipyrromethane (15) or dihydrodipyrrin (16) affords the corresponding enone. Double-ring closure of each affords the model chlorophyll (2) [21] or bacteriochlorophyll (4) [22] , respectively (Scheme 2). The resulting macrocycles share the full hydrocarbon skeleton with the native tetrapyrrole photosynthetic pigments, exemplified by chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a. The double-ring closure is carried out as a one-flask procedure, wherein multiple chemical transformations occur-including Nazarov cyclization, electrophilic aromatic substitution (S E Ar), and elimination of methanol-albeit in unknown sequence. For a definition of all abbreviations employed herein, please see the Section entitled Abbreviations. Again, the desired array of substituents in the target macrocycle is established at a very early stage of the synthesis, upon creation and/or modification of the dihydrodipyrrins for synthesis of the bacteriochlorophyll model compounds (4) , or with the dihydrodipyrrin and dipyrromethane precursors to the chlorophyll model compounds (2) . In both cases, the pre-arranged substituents are conveyed intact to the corresponding hydroporphyrins. Riley The preceding schemes illustrate the critical role of Riley oxidation in preparing a dihydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde for conversion to the hydroporphyrin. Yet a critical limitation is the generally low yield, often less than 50%, for Riley oxidation. Altogether, some 45 dihydrodipyrrins and tetrahydrodipyrrins have been treated with Riley oxidation as part of the synthesis of the aforementioned types of synthetic hydroporphyrins. The general structures are shown in Chart 2. As stated for the analogous tetrahydrodipyrrins [23] , a dihydrodipyrrin appears quite simple, but the appearance may be deceptive because the two different heterocycles (pyrrole, pyrroline) present quite distinct reactivity as follows: (1) the pyrrole contains up to three open sites for electrophilic substitution; (2) the imine of the pyrroline, and the methylidene linkage between the pyrrole and pyrroline, are susceptible to reduction and addition; (3) the imine nitrogen can coordinate to metals; and (4) the pyrrole is a weak acid, whereas the pyrroline is a weak base.

This section aims to cover the scope of the conditions, but is not comprehensive with regards to the scope of substrates and applications, for which other reviews are available [10] [11] [12] [13] . Part 2 provides a review of all cases of dihydrodipyrrins subjected to Riley oxidation including structures, reaction conditions, and yields. One known dihydrodipyrrin is subjected to several reaction conditions identified in part 1. An interlude between the two parts provides an overview of mechanisms.

A key issue here is the use of additives or other variations to the reaction conditions. While benzeneseleninic anhydride is not the same as SeO 2 , owing to the remarkable observations of Barton and coworkers, one set of examples is included. Barton and co-workers found the reaction of 17 and benzeneseleninic anhydride afforded 18 in 42% yield and the 2-selenide derivative 19 in 20% yield [24] . The addition of 3.0 equiv of indole (20) as a scavenger for Se(II) caused formation of 18 in almost quantitative yield, the complete absence of the unwanted derivative 19, and the formation of the indole-trapped phenylselenide 21 (Scheme 3). Reaction with dihydropyran (22) as a scavenging agent afforded similar results along with formation of the dihydropyran-phenylselenide adduct (23) . An upshot of this result is that the selenium product likely reacts with the organic product, an undesirable process that can be thwarted by the addition of a scavenging agent.

Thus, dihydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde 24 afforded the dihydrodipyrrin-dicarboxaldehyde 6 in 61%-71% yield, and increased the yield for the conversion of 25 to 26 to 37% (Scheme 4, top).

Such methods usually gave a mixture of allylic and homoallylic products and were only performed in a small scale accompanied by chromatographic purification. For example, Riley oxidation of cycloocta-1,3-diene (46) gave 48, the acetate of 47, along with two other isomeric acetates, 49 and 50. Subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 gave a mixture of 47, 51, and 52 in 7.5:1.5:1 ratio, respectively [37] . To achieve a larger quantity of product and facilitate purification, the reaction was carried out under an atmosphere of O2, whereupon only two isomers (48 and 49) were obtained in a 19:1 ratio [36] . Herein, an SeO2/O2 combination increased the yield and selectivity for the formation of 47 (Scheme 7). Scheme 6.

Thus, the oxidation of a free base dimethylquinoline (74, lacking the N-oxide) gave the corresponding aldehyde 75 in 70% yield, to be compared with 97% for conversion of the analogous quinoline N-oxide 76 to the aldehyde 77. The oxidation of pyrimidines 78 and 79 gave the corresponding aldehydes 80 and 81 in 90% and 43% yield, respectively, and 79 also gave the dialdehyde product 82.

In this case, the improved reaction selectivity and yield of the monoaldehyde with N-oxide substrates must stem in part, if not wholly, from the greater ease of formation of the corresponding enamine, although the greater stability of the heterocycle-N-oxide versus the parent heterocycle toward indiscriminate oxidation (e.g., removal of an electron from the heterocyclic nucleus) as opposed to site-specific SeO 2 -mediated oxidation cannot be discounted.",

In the case of pyrroline N-oxides lacking an \u03b1-methyl group (65) (66) (67) , treatment with SeO2 introduced an unsaturation at the \u03b2-positions, giving the corresponding 2H-pyrrole (68-70). For the substrate containing a \u03b2-methyl group, but also lacking an \u03b1-methyl group (71), the product mixture included the corresponding \u03b2-unsaturated, 2H-pyrrole (72) and the \u03b2-unsaturated, 2H-pyrrole bearing a \u03b2carboxaldehyde group (73) [40] . The Riley oxidation often presents challenges in purification owing to the presence of a stoichiometric if not excess quantity of SeO 2 . The reaction can be carried out catalytically by the addition of stoichiometric oxidants such as TBHP or O 2 , both of which are desirable from economic, health, and environmental standpoints, as well as easing the challenges of purification. A method for benzylic oxidation that employed O 2 in excess in conjunction with catalytic amounts of nitric oxide and Se or SeO 2 was applied to a series of 2-alkylnaphthalenes (96-98), affording the corresponding naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (99) (Scheme 11, top) [44] . The same reaction with picolines 100 and 101 afforded the isonicotinic acid (102) and picolinic acid (103), respectively [44] . In both reaction sets, the yields spanned a considerable range, from 25% to 80% for 99, and 38% and 94% for 103 and 102, respectively. The mixture of nitric oxide and O 2 recycles reduced selenium (elemental selenium and/or other partially reduced selenium species), and thereby maintains the selenium in the catalytically active, oxidized form (Scheme 11, bottom; shown for elemental Se). Riley oxidation of \u03b1-methyl substituted (and fully unsaturated) heterocyclic N-oxides generally affords good to excellent yields of the corresponding aldehyde [41, 42] . Good comparisons are provided within families of methyl-substituted quinolines and of methyl-substituted pyrimidines [41] . Thus, the oxidation of a free base dimethylquinoline (74, lacking the N-oxide) gave the corresponding aldehyde 75 in 70% yield, to be compared with 97% for conversion of the analogous quinoline N-oxide 76 to the aldehyde 77. The oxidation of pyrimidines 78 and 79 gave the corresponding aldehydes 80 and 81 in 90% and 43% yield, respectively, and 79 also gave the dialdehyde product 82. The N-oxide substrates 83 and 84 did not give a substantially higher yield of the corresponding aldehydes 85 and 86 upon Riley oxidation versus that of 78 and 79; however, for the N-oxide, a monoaldehyde was formed to the exclusion of any dialdehyde 87 (Scheme 9). In this case, the improved reaction selectivity and yield of the monoaldehyde with N-oxide substrates must stem in part, if not wholly, from the greater ease of formation of the corresponding enamine, although the greater stability of the heterocycle-N-oxide versus the parent heterocycle toward indiscriminate oxidation (e.g., removal of an electron from the heterocyclic nucleus) as opposed to site-specific SeO2mediated oxidation cannot be discounted.",

Third, at the end of the reaction, that \"the hot solution is decanted from the precipitated selenium\". The first and second statements highlight the question concerning the nature of the oxidizing species, while the third points to the heterogeneity of the process regardless of whether there is a homogeneous solution at the outset.

A minimum conclusion from the above points is that the nature of the reacting selenium oxide species, invariably displayed as the three-atom entity SeO 2 in textbook presentations, may include more complex substances. For the mechanisms shown in Scheme 13, the eliminated selenium byproducts (Se or HSeOH)-often not displayed explicitly in reports wherein mechanisms are proffered-are formal entities, and in fact, relatively little data are typically available concerning the composition of the selenium products, which is understandable given the focus by synthetic chemists on the organic product of the reaction. In his first paper, Riley described the appearance, recovery, and regeneration of the precipitated selenium species [1] , and a selenium-containing insoluble orange, red, or black film inside the flask upon quenching the Riley oxidation (by addition of water or base) has been noted by many, including Jacobi and coworkers, who performed the first Riley oxidations of hydrodipyrrins [17] , the focus of the present review. Early reviews described reports of complexes of organic substrates and selenium species in the precipitates, as well as controversies about mechanism [10] . The complexity of oxoselenium chemistry precludes simple correlation of selenium products with proposed organic mechanisms; in this regard, a formal species such as HSeOH could in principle undergo reaction, disproportionation, or combination with SeO 2 or other species to form polyselenides and/or other products (as one hypothetical example, HSeOH + SeO 2 \u2192 H 2 SeO 3 + Se); similar reactions may occur with SeO 2 (or oligomeric species thereof) with O-Se-OH moieties attached to an intermediate (e.g., III or V). If multiple selenium oxide species are present, one or more of a multiplicity of pathways may prevail, particularly under various conditions-as one explicit example, acidic conditions that cause protonation of a heterocyclic nitrogen atom may shift a reaction toward one pathway that is not a significant conduit for reactant to product under neutral conditions, and vice versa. Thus, the three mechanisms displayed in Scheme 13 are shown here for completeness as well as consideration of the results obtained upon Riley oxidation of diverse substrates.",

Jacobi and coworkers reported that the use of sublimed SeO 2 and a \"wet\" solvent did not substantially increase the yield, and even a trace amount of water accelerated decomposition [17] . Concerning temperature, most reactions were carried out at room temperature.

In organic chemistry, selenium finds its most widespread use in the SeO 2 -mediated conversion of a methyl group to the corresponding aldehyde group, which originated with the pioneering work of Harry Lister Riley in the early 1930s. In tetrapyrrole chemistry, Riley oxidation provides an essential transformation of 1-methylhydrodipyrrins to the corresponding hydrodipyrrin-carboxaldehyde or dimethyl acetal thereof. The comprehensive review here shows that the Riley oxidation has considerable tolerance for substituents in the pyrrole and pyrroline ring of the dihydrodipyrrin, although in general, the yields rarely exceed 70%, with yields of 30%-40% often more typical. Hardly any data are available concerning the nature of the side reactions, and byproducts formed, that account for the low yields. In context, most substrates examined to date for Riley oxidations have contained ketones or alkenes rather than heterocycles or imines, as described herein. Particular structural limitations that cause failure of the Riley oxidation with hydrodipyrrins include the absence of any substituents in the pyrrole nucleus, or the presence of a lone bromine atom. On the other hand, a single ester or even aryl substituent in the pyrrole nucleus suffices to give a successful oxidation. Such structural limitations impact the scope of available hydroporphyrins. The survey in part I here of a broad range of substrates reveals diverse conditions beyond those considered for the classic Riley oxidation, namely SeO 2 in 1,4-dioxane. Many observations that bear on mechanism have been reported over the years, but fundamental mechanistic studies (which largely petered out in the latter part of the 20th century) may warrant renewed investigation, particularly in the context of the available diversity of reaction conditions. Most such reaction conditions have not been applied to the hydrodipyrrins, which may present new synthetic opportunities as the Riley oxidation nears its century mark.",

J.S.L. carried out the reaction shown in Figure 1 (during the Covid-19 lockdown), and wrote most of the paper. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript. Following an established procedure [22] , a sample of 4-bromo-2-(3,3-dimethyl-2-nitro-5-oxohexyl)-1-tosylpyrrole [67] (117, 3.43 g, 7.30 mmol) was treated with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (9.0 mL of 1.0 M in tetrahydrofuran (THF), 9.0 mmol; the THF was freshly distilled from Na/benzophenone ketyl) under an argon atmosphere and stirred for 1.5 h under reflux in an oil bath (Scheme A1). The reaction mixture was treated with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 followed by ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to a brown oil. The oil was further dried under high vacuum and purified by chromatography (silica, hexanes/ethyl acetate (3:2)) to afford the deprotected pyrrole as a yellow oil (501 mg); this product was used directly in the next step. For the ensuing TiCl3-catalyzed reductive cyclization, a solution of the pyrrole (501 mg, 1.58 mmol) in THF (10 mL; freshly distilled from Na/benzophenone ketyl) was deaerated by bubbling with argon for 10 min, and then treated with NaOMe (430 mg, 7.90 mmol) followed by stirring for 45 min at 0 \u00b0C under argon. In the second flask, a solution of NH4OAc (48.7 g, 632 mmol) in water (63 mL) was deaerated by bubbling with argon for 30 min and then treated with TiCl3 (1.22 g, 7.90 mmol, 20% w/v solution in 2 N HCl). The suspension was stirred for 15 min at room temperature under an atmosphere of argon. The solution in the first flask containing the nitronate anion of the free pyrrole was transferred via a cannula to the buffered TiCl3 solution in the second flask. The resulting brown mixture was stirred for 1 h under argon, and the flask was sealed to react for 16 h. The reaction mixture was slowly poured into a stirred mixture of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (350 mL) and ethyl acetate (200 mL). The entire mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 15 min. A clear phase separation did not occur. An additional quantity (200 mL) of ethyl acetate was added. The organic layer was separated and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (200 mL \u00d7 3). The darkorange organic layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to a dark oil. The resulting oil was passed through a silica column (silica, hexanes/ethyl acetate (3:1)) to afford the title compound as a brown oil (83 mg, 14%): 1 ",
