F protein is conserved, whereas the C-terminal third hypervariable region of the G protein is subject to rapid mutation [2]. On the basis of their reactions with monoclonal antibodies, the viral strains have been separated into two major serotypes (RSV-A and RSV-B), and nucleotide sequence analysis has led to the identification of 11 RSV-A (GA1-GA7, SAA1, NA1-NA2, and ON1) [2\u20134] and 23 RSV-B genotypes, (GB1-GB4, SAB1-SAB3, SAB4, URU1, URU2, BA1-BA12 and THB) [5\u201313]. Multiple genotypes can co-circulate during successive epidemic seasons, but a new genotype (or one spreading from another country) may replace previously dominant strains [5,14,15].",

In addition, as recently occurred in Japan [10], RSV-B/BA9 was predominant between RSV-B viruses. It was identified in all the years of the study, whereas detection of RSV-B/BA10 was limited to 2010\u20132011 and 2012\u20132013 seasons. Phylogenetic and deduced amino acid sequence analyses of the RSV strains revealed that ongoing changes characterised the different clusters in the RSV-A tree [31,32]. Interestingly, almost all of the Italian NA1 strains lost the first N-glycosylation site due to substitution N237D [5], whereas this N-glycosylation site was restored in three NA1 and all ON1 strains. The NA1 strains fell into two clusters characterised by a number of amino acid changes, but it is not clear how these changes favoured the evasion of the host immune response. The ON1 genotype was characterised by E232G, T253K and P292L substitutions, as previously reported in Chinese strains [33], and other cluster-specific mutations were observed in ON1 clusters A (L274P, L298P and 310P) and A1 (G254E, Y273H, and Y297H) [18,34].",

Our search for phylogenetic signatures of selective pressure in RSV-A and RVS-B showed that the RSV genes have predominantly negatively or neutrally selected evolving sites. Only a minority were under positive selection, thus suggesting that the forces driving the evolution of RSV are mainly stochastic. However, additional investigations are needed to evaluate whether amino acid changes in the G protein may help the virus to alter the antigenic characteristics leading to an evolutionary advantage.",

This permitted to have precise information regarding the real pathogenic role of this virus avoiding the risk of misinformation that can occur when all the RSV infections, including co-infections between RSV and other respiratory viruses, are studied. However, only children aged < 2 years attending the Emergency Room were enrolled. Moreover, in comparison to RSV-B, a significant greater number of RSV-A positive cases was identified. These are limits that do not allow to draw firm conclusions about the real global clinical relevance of the different RSV types in paediatrics. RSV infection is more severe in younger children and mild to moderate infections are usually followed by primary care paediatricians in the community [1]. However, in the study population, we did not find any difference in the severity of the disease due to RSV-A and RSV-B strains. This finding is in line those of some previous studies [39\u201341], but conflicts with those of other epidemiological evaluations showing a significantly higher risk of severe disease due to type A [42\u201345] or type B [46]. Moreover, it is not agree with findings in various cell culture and in vivo models suggesting that individual RSV-A strains may be more infective, virulent and immunopathogenic [1]. In this regard, it is interesting to note the findings of a recent in vitro study of primary epithelial cells and epithelial cell lines, which suggest that prototypical RSV-A and RSV-B strains are differently capable of inducing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation (i.e. an important step in the cascade of events leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) and the subsequent induction of the NF-\u03baB responsive genes interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-8, with RSV-B eliciting significantly weaker responses than RSV-A [47].",

The greater severity of the infections due to RSV-A/NA1 in comparison with RSV-A/ON1 suggest that different RSV genotypes may be associated with different degrees of virulence, and that the relevance of one RSV type in clinical practice may depend on the incidence of infections due to the most virulent genotype during the period of the epidemiological evaluation. A simple evaluation of RSV type is not enough to predict the risk of severe infection during epidemics, and only studies specifically planned to evaluate the virulence of the different genotypes can allow a precise assessment of what can be expected when a particular genotype is in circulation.",

The lower virulence of A/ON1 also seems to be further supported by our finding that the clinical manifestations due to A/ON1 infection were significantly less severe than those due to the simultaneously circulating B/BA9 and B/BA10 viruses. Similar data have been reported by Panayiotou et al. [48], who showed that patients infected with RSV-A/ON1 had a significantly lower mean severity score than children with B/BA infection.",
