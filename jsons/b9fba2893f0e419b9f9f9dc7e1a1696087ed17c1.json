In addition, early symptoms of infection warrant caution until the nature and severity of the infection become apparent. Because myocarditis may or may not be accompanied by fever, malaise or catarrhal symptoms, athletes should be informed about the symptoms suggestive of this disease. Although sudden unexpected death resulting from myocarditis is rare, exercise should be avoided whenever myocarditis is suspected.

During that 'open window', 3 the sensitivity to URT [4] [5] [6] and possibly also to other infections is potentially increased. If resting periods between such exercise sessions/ competitions are not long enough to allow the immune function to recover, an increased sensitivity to infectious diseases may be present for a prolonged period of time. 7, 8 The potential for such a situation truly exists among the highperforming elite within several areas of sports and notably so in seasonal endurance sports. For URT infections, it has been suggested that a J-shaped curve best describes the relationship between the intensity of physical activity, ranging from a sedentary lifestyle to the activity of the high-performance endurance athlete (along the x axis), and the sensitivity to infections (along the y axis). 9, 10 Interestingly, a recent study in elite swimmers has indicated that measurement of salivary IgA levels over a training season may be predictive for athletes at risk of infection. 11 In the sports setting, air-and droplet-borne pathogens, such as common cold viruses, are easily transmitted by aerosol or contact, especially in team sports, posing a threat not least to the elite.

This is to satisfy the increased nutritional needs of the activated immune system and to provide substrates for the accelerated energy production during fever, which is generally associated with anorexia and decreased food intake. The elevated insulin levels during infection and fever generally hamper the mobilization of fatty acids from fat depots. 12, 13 An important feature of the acute phase reaction is the induction of a generalized catabolism of muscle protein, which progresses throughout the acute phase of the infection. In humans, muscle protein degradation and tissue wasting was originally demonstrated in nitrogen balance studies in experimental viral, bacterial and protozoan infections (Fig. 2 ). 14 Thus, from a qualitative aspect, these responses are essentially similar regardless of the causative organism, whereas their magnitude is related to the virulence of the organism and the incubated dose, as well as to the susceptibility/immune status of the host. Several mild infections, however, such as an uncomplicated common cold, may not give rise to any significant systemic acute phase reaction. This array of acute phase responses, one of which is the occurrence of fever, is triggered by the release of cytokines from activated macrophages and monocytes. 12, 13 Similarly, exercise is accompanied by increased body temperature and increased immune activity. 15 However, although exercise has been shown to be associated with the release to plasma of endogenous pyrogen, 16 a majority of studies do not support the idea that exercise hyperthermia is the result of a change in the body temperature set point, 17 as is the case in infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 321, "end": 323, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 949, "end": 952, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 953, "end": 955, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1315, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1883, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1886, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1985, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2097, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2234, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 586, "end": 594, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1309, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Metabolic responses to infections"}, {"text": "The skeletal muscles, which constitute approximately 45% of bodyweight, are the major source of amino acids, 14 but the heart muscle also contributes ( Fig. 1) .

Furthermore, both in young male and young female adults, such infections cause a decrease in the aerobic exercise capacity, as determined from the heart rate response during submaximal exercise, of approximately 25%. 29 The greater decrease in the aerobic capacity compared with that in the muscle capacity is due to circulatory deregulation associated both with the infection and with bed rest, both of which contribute to deterioration of the aerobic capacity; the circulatory deregulation, in turn, is partly an effect of a decreased blood volume resulting from the bed rest. 30 The aerobic exercise capacity is dependent on central factors, such as the blood volume, total haemoglobin and myocardial function, as well as on peripheral factors, that is, the state of the skeletal muscles. 31 All of these factors may be negatively influenced by the infection or by the clinical bed rest that is part of the treatment, or both. 29, 30 The deterioration of isometric strength and endurance may, however, be almost entirely ascribable to the infection-induced catabolic effects on muscle. 27, 28 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 392, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 435, "end": 437, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 854, "end": 856, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1218, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1431, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1570, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1573, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1729, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1732, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Performance during and after infections"}, {"text": "Only few studies have focused on the question of whether, prior to the time of exposure to microorganisms, there is a critical period during which exercise stress may influence the proneness to develop subsequent disease. These few experimental studies on bacterial infections in rodents have shown that one bout of vigorous exercise shortly prior to infection drastically increases the resistance to the infection. Conversely, when the infection is contracted before the time of exercise, strenuous exercise is detrimental to the host. All animal experiments of which we are aware concerning nonmyocarditic bacterial and viral infections have shown that strenuous exercise during the febrile phase of an infection may be hazardous. For obvious ethical reasons, analogous experiments in humans are not feasible. For a more extensive review, see Friman and Ilb\u00e4ck. 13 Interestingly, however, the muscle trainability seems to be preserved during some but not other infections. In experimental tularaemia in the rat, for example, strenuous exercise during the acute febrile course counteracted, but did not eliminate, the infectionassociated muscle catabolism, yielding a net result of more limited protein degradation than in resting infected animals, 18 whereas in experimental influenza no anabolic effect of the exercise was seen. 32 In both experiments, exercise during ongoing febrile infection caused complications or increased lethality. Among clinical conditions where microorganisms cause disease in the central nervous system, poliomyelitis has been studied in relation to exercise. This disease may become aggravated by exercise when performed in the early, preparalytic stage, resulting in more severe paralysis in muscles that have been involved in the exercise (for review, see Pedersen 33 ). In acute viral hepatitis, controlled studies have shown no adverse short-or long-term effects of exercise of various, though not maximal, intensities during the early course.

Myocarditis is one of the various cardiovascular effects of cocaine abuse and in one study was found at autopsy in 20% of subjects in whom cocaine was present in the blood. 68 The possible use of central stimulants should thus be considered in elite athletes with cardiac involvement. 69, 70 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 440, "end": 442, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 818, "end": 820, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 930, "end": 933, "text": "69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 934, "end": 936, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Aetiology"}, {"text": "Much of the current knowledge on the pathogenesis of myocarditis has been obtained from experimental studies in coxsackievirus mouse models.
