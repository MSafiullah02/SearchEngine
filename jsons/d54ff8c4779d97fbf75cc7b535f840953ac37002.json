The incubation 68 period for symptomatic development in COVID-19 is approximately 4-7 days. 5 Many patients 69 with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer multiple organ dysfunctions, suggesting a 70 systemic targeting by the SARS-COV-2. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be 71 about 2.3%, with a range from 6 to 41 days from the onset of symptoms to death. 10,11 72",

Levels of WBC and CRP increased 143 gradually and significantly during the disease progression (Table 2) . IL-6 levels increased 144 dramatically in all subgroups of patients with a peak in severe cases (Table 2) . Changes in 145 number of monocytes and levels of ALT, AST, ALP and GGT were not in evidence (Table 2) . TC (p<0.05) in patients across all three categories (Fig 2, Table 2 ). HDL-c levels decreased 152 significantly in critical cases as compared to levels in mild and severe cases (p<0.05) (Fig 2,  153 Table 2). TG levels in COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than the levels in normal 154 subjects (p<0.01), but significantly decreased in critical cases as compared with mild and 155 severe cases (p<0.01, Table 2 ). The age and gender-matched normal control group (n=50; age: 156 62 (53, 69)) showed almost the same median values of LDL-c, HDL-c and TC, but slightly 157 narrow IQRs, as compared with that from adult healthy population (n=1574, age: 40 (32, 52)) 158 (Fig 2) . 159",

The number of 162 lymphocytes positively correlated with the levels of LDL-c (R= 0.236, p<0.001, Fig 3D) , TC (R= 163 0.277, p<0.001, Fig 3E) , and HDL-c (R= 0.158, p<0.001, Fig 3F) and diminishing cholesterol efflux and transport. 21 We found that IL-6 was dramatically elevated 203 in 96% of all patients. This strongly suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are a 204 major contributor to the lipid abnormality in patients. Third, lipids are highly vulnerable to 205 degradation by free radicals, whose levels are generally elevated in host cells with a viral permeability. 27,28 Therefore, one possible mechanism underlying our data is that during the 214 disease progression, severer inflammation and worse vascular permeability are, more plasma 215 cholesterol and lipids leak into alveolar space, and less LDL-c and cholesterol remain in the 216 plasma. We also posit that the dyslipidemia plays an important role in pathological development 217 of COVID-19, which mechanism needs an urgent investigation. 218",

The IL-6 levels showed an inverse correlation with LDL-c (R= -0.176, p=0.032, Fig 165 3G) and TC (R= 0.170, p=0.038,Fig 3H), but no significant association with HDL-study, we performed a retrospective analysis of lipid profiles on COVID-19 patients. This 172 is the first report with clinical laboratory lipid data on such a large patient population. Our data 173 demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 develop hypolipidemia as early as when they have 174 mild symptoms. The reduced levels of LDL-c positively correlate with levels of CRP, and 175inversely correlate with lymphocytic numbers and IL-6 levels. These are three critical factors 176 associated with the disease severity in patients. Our findings provide the first insight into a 177 pathological evolution of lipidology in COVID-19 in patients; this will not only aid in 178 understanding the mechanism of disease's dyslipidemia, but will also help in assessing 179 progression of and prognosis of the disease. 180So far, there is no consensus regarding the value of serum TC to define hypolipidemia. 14 In 181 this study, we use the mean of TC (174 mg/dL) from the normal control subjects as the cut-off 182 value to describe this condition in COVID-19 patients. This will provide a direct comparison of 183 lipid levels in COVID-19 patients to the normal subjects with age and gender matched.184 Furthermore, some reports have used high levels up to 189 mg/dL to define hypolipidemia. 15,16 185 Hypolipidemia is a rare condition and it can be caused by a genetic alteration or secondary 186 factors. In this study, the decreased levels of lipids are most likely due to the SARS-COV-2 187 infection. Our current data show that a reduction of lipid levels in patients with COVID-19 has an 188 association with the severity of the symptoms. Therefore, the hypolipidmedia in COVID-19 189 patients shall raise an urgent awareness to physicians who are now in the frontline fighting 190 against this pandemic. 191 Inflammation caused by viral infection may result in dyslipidemia in patients. For example, 192 patients with HIV have altered lipid profiles, such as a decrease in HDL-c and an increase in 193 LDL-c levels; 17,18 patients infected with dengue virus may show a decrease in serum LDL-c 194 levels; 19 and hepatitis B patients in the cirrhosis phase have lower levels of HDL-c and LDL-c. 20 195 In this study, we found decreased levels of LDL-c in patients. There are several possible 196 explanations for this dyslipidemia. First, SARS-COV-2 may damage liver function and thereby 197 reduce LDL-c biosynthesis. Serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP increased moderately in about 198 half of all patients, indicating mild liver-function damage. Therefore, changes in liver function are 199 most likely not the major contributor to the reduced LDL-c levels. Second, acute inflammation 200 induced by SARS-COV-2 alters lipid metabolism. It has been reported that pro-inflammatory 201 cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 modulate lipid metabolism by altering liver function 202",

Fourth, SARS-COV-2 infection may alter vascular permeability, causing a leakage of 208 cholesterol molecules into tissues, such as alveolar spaces, to form exudate. For example, 209 exudates are observed in the early phase of COVID-19 lung pathology. 23 Intra-alveolar 210 exudates have been found in lung autopsies from SARS patients as well as in cynomolgus 211 macaques infected with SARS-COV. 24-26 Exudative fluids, containing high levels of protein (>2.9 212 g/dL) and cholesterol (> 45 mg/dL), are caused by inflammation-related vascular 213",
