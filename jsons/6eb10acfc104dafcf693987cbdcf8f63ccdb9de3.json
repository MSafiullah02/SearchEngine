Currently, there lacks suitable antiviral drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Early, rapid, and reliable diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 is of top priority to facilitate public health interventions that can reduce or avoid further spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Dennis Lo and Chiu 2020). Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a robust technology for reliable laboratory diagnosis, and routinely used to detect causative pathogens. Since the release of genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in Jan. 11, 2020, many TaqMan probe-based RT-qPCR assays had been developed and used in confirmation of large number of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the outbreak (Chu et al. 2020; Dennis Lo and Chiu 2020) . Facing the on-going increase of suspected cases and potential contacts, however, the detection capacity of RT-qPCR assays have shown limitations in speed and volume because these assays require sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, and are relatively time-consuming (about 1.5-2 h). Therefore, there is an urgent demand for faster and sensitive Point-of-Care testing (POCT) assays to facilitate rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is no POCT assay available for SARS-CoV-2 yet. Here, we present a novel visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 using mismatch-tolerant technique.",

The reactions were performed at 63\u00b0C, and the color change was observed at the 30-, 40-, and 50-min time points. The visual detection system contains a pH-sensitive indicator dye cresol red. Because LAMP amplification results in a significant pH change of buffer from an initial alkaline condition to a final acidic condition (Tanner et al. 2015) , the color change of cresol red from burgundy to orange or yellow indicates a positive reaction. The assay gave a clear color indication for all tested samples during 30-50 min (data not shown). We selected 40 min as the cut-off for the visual assay (Fig. 1E) . The sensitivity of the colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 was 30 copies per reaction, slightly lower than the real-time monitoring (Fig. 1E) .",

Early diagnosis and timely implementation of intervention and quarantine measures are very crucial for prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (Dennis Lo and Chiu 2020). The rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent release of its genome sequence are very important in a public health perspective, and these made the development of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays possible. Many RT-qPCR assays have been developed and used in the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic (Chu et al. 2020) . However, high level facility requirement of RT-qPCR assays is a major factor limiting the confirmation speed and causing a large number of suspected cases waiting for tests as these assays are not available in primary care and community hospitals or health care centers where there were no real-time thermal cycler and trained professional. On the other hand, the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4 days (range 0-24.0 days), and the longest incubation period observed is 24 days (Guan et al. 2020) . In particular, some infected individuals did not develop obvious clinical symptoms (Rothe et al. 2020) . The long incubation period and asymptomatic infections imply a huge risk of virus transmission to other people (Wu et al. 2020a, b) . In this respect, POCT detection tools that can be performed in fields and even patients' own houses have a huge advantage, and should be developed.",

Recently, we developed a mismatchtolerant LAMP method by adding 0.15 U of high-fidelity DNA polymerase . The main difference between the mismatch-tolerant LAMP and the conventional ones is the inclusion of an additional amount of highfidelity DNA polymerase in the former, which largely improves the sensitivity and reaction speed Zhou et al. 2019) . Using this mismatch-tolerant technique, we developed a one-step single-tube RT-LAMP assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay can be performed at 63\u00b0C for 40 min in a real-time or a regular thermal cycler, or any heating block such as a dry incubator or a water bath. The result is easily judged by the color change from burgundy to orange or yellow. Compared to the conventional LAMP protocol, the novel SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is more rapid and more sensitive. The sensitivity of the assay is 30 copies per reaction. Although we did not test the specificity for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV due to a lack of clinical samples, we sound the assay exhibited specificity by testing 17 common human respiratory viruses, including four other human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU-1 and NL63. The evaluation with 24 clinical samples showed that all 17 COVID-19 patients in Nantong city were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by both the RT-LAMP and the RT-qPCR assays, showing a full consistence.",

Furthermore, it is also ready to be used in fields for screening samples from wild animals and environments to facilitate the identification of potential intermediate hosts that mediate the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans.",
