            "text": "The direct determination of macromolecular structures from X-ray diffraction data alone is a major goal for the crystallo\u00adgraphic community. Seminal work by Hendrickson and Teeter demonstrated that anomalous scattering from native S atoms alone is sufficient to support de novo structure determination (Hendrickson & Teeter, 1981 \u25b8). Interestingly, this daring sulfur-SAD experiment was performed long before the advent of density modification and the maturation of detectors and software for maximizing signals from carefully formulated synchrotron data-collection strategies. It took another \u223c20 years (Dauter et al., 1999 \u25b8) for the crystallographic community to embrace the power of sulfur anomalous scattering for the de novo structure determination of proteins. Since then, several experiments have highlighted the necessity for highly redundant data in order to attain the accuracy required to use the weak anomalous signal for phasing (see, for example, Dauter & Dauter, 1999 \u25b8; Dauter & Adamiak, 2001 \u25b8; Ramagopal et al., 2003b\n \u25b8; Debreczeni et al., 2003 \u25b8; Us\u00f3n et al., 2003 \u25b8; Sarma & Karplus, 2006 \u25b8; Wagner et al., 2006 \u25b8). A recent comprehensive study covering \u223c140 structures determined using sulfur anomalous signal further highlights the necessity of collecting accurate data (Rose et al., 2015 \u25b8).",

            "text": "Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) has become the method of choice for de novo determination of protein crystal structures (Hendrickson, 2014 \u25b8), accounting for 73% of the structures determined by experimental phasing deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., 2000 \u25b8) in 2013 (Bunk\u00f3czi et al., 2015 \u25b8). The use of intrinsic S atoms and selenomethionine derivatives for the experimental phasing of protein structures has been extensively discussed (see, for example, Hendrickson & Teeter, 1981 \u25b8; Hendrickson et al., 1990 \u25b8; Doutch et al., 2012 \u25b8; Kim et al., 2013 \u25b8; Ramagopal et al., 2003b\n \u25b8; Sarma & Karplus, 2006 \u25b8; Dauter et al., 1999 \u25b8). When it is not possible to use the anomalous signals from intrinsic S atoms, or selenomethionine derivatives cannot be prepared, derivatives of anomalous scatterers such as Zn, As, Mn, halide ions, halogenated fragments etc. have been exploited for the purpose of experimental phasing (see, for example, Dauter & Dauter, 2007 \u25b8; Kim et al., 2013 \u25b8; Liu et al., 2011 \u25b8; Ramagopal et al., 2003a\n \u25b8; Salgado et al., 2005 \u25b8; Bauman et al., 2016 \u25b8). There have also been reports of the utilization of anomalous signal at short wavelengths (\u223c1 \u00c5) from serendipitously acquired scatterers for experimental phasing, either with data collection optimized for SAD (Gadd et al., 2015 \u25b8) or the use of unexpected anomalous signal from routine data sets (Cuesta-Seijo et al., 2006 \u25b8; McClelland et al., 2016 \u25b8), with McClelland and coworkers reporting the utilization of anomalous signal from Cd2+ collected near the selenium edge from a protein that crystallized in space group P1. The use of longer wavelength X-rays (\u223c2.0 \u00c5 or above) for native SAD has been proposed and has been in practice since the early part of this century (Weiss et al., 2001 \u25b8; Liu et al., 2000 \u25b8; Djinovi\u0107 Carugo et al., 2005 \u25b8; Micossi et al., 2002 \u25b8), with continued interest in this decade (Weinert et al., 2015 \u25b8; Cianci et al., 2016 \u25b8; Liebschner et al., 2016 \u25b8; Gorgel et al., 2015 \u25b8; Zhu et al., 2012 \u25b8; Liu et al., 2012 \u25b8; Goulet et al., 2010 \u25b8; Lakomek et al., 2009 \u25b8), as it avoids the need to prepare selenomethionine or other derivatives. The current state of the art in native SAD has been comprehensively discussed by Rose et al. (2015 \u25b8). At the wavelengths typically accessible at synchrotron beamlines and home sources, the anomalous signal from sulfur is weak. The use of longer wavelengths at a synchrotron source is expected to result in stronger anomalous signal, for example at a wavelength of 2.1 \u00c5 f\u2032\u2032 for sulfur is 0.98 e, which is close to double the value at the wavelength of 1.54 \u00c5 (0.55 e) corresponding to a copper-anode home source. However, most beamlines are not optimized to operate at longer wavelengths, and the use of longer wavelengths limits the data quality owing to a number of factors, including the maximum resolution that can be achieved, increased absorption, radiation damage and the possibility of harmonic contamination (Doutch et al., 2012 \u25b8).",

            "text": "Although longer wavelengths are preferred for the exploit\u00adation of weak anomalous signal from atoms with Z < 20, an initial diffraction experiment on a new protein usually aims at obtaining the highest resolution data, even when the sequence identity of the protein to that of known structures is below the \u2018twilight zone\u2019 for molecular replacement. Moreover, most beamlines are optimized to collect data at a wavelength of around 1.0 \u00c5, where the expected anomalous signal from anomalous scatterers such as calcium and sulfur is low. Many crystallization conditions contain metals such as calcium and manganase as well as chloride ions, and it has been noted in a study on the phasing of 23 proteins that in 90% of cases light ions such as chloride, phosphate, sulfate, potassium or calcium were interacting with the protein molecule (Mueller-Dieckmann et al., 2007 \u25b8). Anomalous signals from these serendipitous anomalous scatterers can potentially be used in experimental phasing of protein structures. However, the use of weak anomalous signals from adventitiously bound weak anomalous scatterers for phasing in macromolecular crystallo\u00adgraphy is seldom discussed. Here, we present two such cases where anomalous signal from surface-bound Ca atoms acquired from the mother liquor were exploited for phasing: (i) PSPTO_5518 from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (PSPTO) and (ii) the hypothetical protein PTO0218 from Picrophilus torridus (PTO). Although there have been previous reports of successful calcium/sulfur SAD phasing at \u223c1 \u00c5 wavelength using the combined anomalous signal from structural Ca atoms together with intrinsic sulfurs (Wang et al., 2006 \u25b8; Koch et al., 2010 \u25b8), to the best of our knowledge PSPTO and PTO represent the first two cases where anomalous signal from surface-bound Ca atoms was used for phasing. We also examined hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL), where data collected at \u223c1.0 \u00c5 wavelength were sufficient to drive de novo structure solution using the sulfur anomalous signal alone. To the best of our knowledge, HEWL is the first case where just the sulfur anomalous signal at \u223c1.0 \u00c5 wavelength has been shown to be sufficient for de novo structure determination. Also, for PSPTO the data were collected near the selenium edge and for PTO they were collected near the iron edge; moreover, the multiplicity was near or below 10 in all cases. However, the anomalous signals from these atoms, with the Bijvoet ratio being close to Wang\u2019s limit of 0.6% (Wang, 1985 \u25b8) in two cases (PSPTO and HEWL) and around 1.5% in the case of PTO, could nevertheless be used to obtain the structures. These results suggest that a careful analysis of supposedly native data and with judicious manual intervention can lead to the unanticipated determination of structures.",

This protein has three cysteine residues. A BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1990 \u25b8) against the PDB did not reveal any suitable models, suggesting that the sequence is highly unique and ruling out the possibility of determining the structure by molecular replacement. Native X-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 0.979 \u00c5 with a crystal rotation of 0.5\u00b0 per frame, and a total of 540 frames were collected covering a 270\u00b0 wedge, with an exposure time of 10 s. Although the intention was to collect an accurate and high-resolution native data set, it is our practice to check for the presence of anomalous scatterers in most high-resolution data sets (>1.8 \u00c5). It should be noted that scaling the data in HKL-2000 with the \u2018scale anomalous\u2019 option did not indicate the presence of any anomalous signal (see \u00a74.2 and Fig. 2). This observation is not surprising as the sulfur edge is almost 10 200 eV (or 4.037 \u00c5) from the energy of the X-rays used in this experiment. However, to our surprise, a substructure search in space group P41212 in SHELXD, looking for four anomalous scatterers, using anomalous data to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution, produced two strong peaks followed by four additional peaks (see Supporting Information), which were consistent in most correct solutions. The map obtained with the original coordinates showed better CC, contrast, connectivity and FOM compared with that obtained from inverted coordinates, confirming that the space group was indeed P41212 and not P43212. Model building resulted in a model containing residues 4\u2013135 of the 145-amino-acid protein. The two strong peaks in the substructure solution suggested an anomalous scatterer slightly larger than sulfur. The crystallization conditions contained calcium chloride, from which Ca atoms could have been acquired. On refinement of the model, two strong difference density peaks were observed on the surface near Gln101, Asp103 and Thr105. The coordination with the amino-acid side chains and water molecules together with the anomalous difference Fourier map suggested that these were likely bound Ca atoms (Supplementary Fig. S1a), which were modelled in the refined structure.",

A significant drop in occupancy was observed between the first and second heavy-atom peaks and between the second and third, with a smooth transition in the occupancies of additional sites (see Supporting Information). In general, for substructures involving Se or S atoms (i.e. covalently bonded to the protein) such variation in occupancy is rare. The observed drop in occupancy between the third and the fourth atom suggested the presence of anomalous scatterers other than sulfur. Model building with the phases obtained after SHELXC/D/E resulted in a model with 678 of the 726 residues.",

Beamline X29 at NSLS employs a mini-gap undulator source, with the maximum flux observed around 11.5 keV (a wavelength of \u223c1.078 \u00c5; Shi et al., 2006 \u25b8). As a test case, we used hen egg-white lysozyme, a well studied 129-amino-acid protein with eight cysteines and two methionines (referred to as HEWL). At this wavelength, the f\u2032\u2032 value for sulfur is 0.28 e and the expected anomalous signal is as low as 0.61%. The protein crystallized in space group P43212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.46 \u00c5 resolution. X-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 1.075 \u00c5 (11.533 keV) with a crystal rotation of 1\u00b0 per frame and 0.5 s exposure. Owing to the strong diffraction, 200 frames were collected with the detector at \u223c200 mm (corresponding to \u223c1.46 \u00c5) with a sevenfold attenuation followed by another 157 frames with an unattenuated beam, both with a crystal rotation of 1\u00b0. Although the high-exposure data were expected to have a large number of overloaded reflections, this would lead to a more accurate measurement of low-intensity reflections owing to the higher beam flux, thus providing a more accurate measurement of the anomalous differences. Hence, the two data sets were merged and used for phasing. Substructure solution was attempted by searching for 14 S atoms to include surface-bound Cl atoms (observed in most structures with crystallization conditions containing NaCl), with three disulfide bonds resolved (DSUL 3 command in SHELXD), using anomalous data to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. Considering the facts that (i) the data were collected approximately 9000 eV (or 3.941 \u00c5) away from the sulfur edge, (ii) the total wedge for both data sets together is only around 360\u00b0 and (iii) the f\u2032\u2032 value at this wavelength for sulfur is very low (0.28 e), we did not anticipate successful identification of the sulfur positions. However, out of 1000 cycles, three solutions with high CC/PATFOM and clear bimodal distribution distinguishing the correct and wrong solutions (Supplementary Fig. S2c) gave a clear indication that the substructure solution was successful. The coordinates of the first few anomalous scatterers in all three putative solutions were manually checked for consistency of the sulfur positions and the coordinates from the best solution were used for phasing with SHELXE with the solvent content set to 35%. As expected for lysozyme, the map obtained from the original coordinates (space group P43212) after 20 cycles of density modification had a better CC, contrast, connectivity and FOM compared with that obtained from the inverted substructure coordinates (space group P41212). The resulting map was input to ARP/wARP for model building; a single chain of 126 residues was docked into the map.",

The CCall/CCweak from SHELXD for each of the data sets is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. As more of the intense reflections were removed, determining the substructure solution required tuning of the E-values and resolution. Also, the number of correct substructure solutions obtained decreased as more of the intense reflections were removed (as observed on moving from Supplementary Fig. S4a to Fig. S4f), with the removal of the top 30% intense reflections, similar to the case of data set 5, yielding only one correct solution. When the top 35% of intense reflections were removed, tuning the E-values and resolution with 10 000 cycles in SHELXD did not yield a correct substructure.

            "text": "It is an accepted fact that high multiplicity is one of the key factors for successful sulfur phasing, even when X-ray energies corresponding to higher f\u2032\u2032 values (e.g. 5\u20138 keV) are used. One must be mindful that multiplicity comes with the detrimental effects of radiation-damage-induced errors (Garman & Nave, 2002 \u25b8; Holton, 2009 \u25b8; Ravelli & Garman, 2006 \u25b8; Garman, 2010 \u25b8). A dose limit of 2 \u00d7 107 Gy (1 Gy = 1 J kg\u22121) was proposed by Henderson for cryocooled protein crystals, at which the intensities of diffracted rays are reduced by half (D\n50; Henderson, 1990 \u25b8). Based on a recent experiment, this limit has been relaxed to 3 \u00d7 107 Gy or 30 MGy, where the average diffraction intensities reduce to 70% of their original value (D\n70; Owen et al., 2006 \u25b8). Another recent study (Liebschner et al., 2015 \u25b8) suggests that the damage rate may be different for different crystals and indicates that the damage D\n70 was 30% greater at 6.33 keV (7.5 MGy) compared with 12.66 keV (11 MGy), highlighting that longer wavelengths result in greater damage. The acceptable extent of damage depends on the objective of the experiment, based on which the quality of the data obtained requires a different level of accuracy. For example, when the experimenter is looking for overall structural information, acceptable damage could be higher compared with the situation where critical biological information or exploitation of weak anomalous signal for de novo structure solution is sought. In the latter two cases, the involvement of highly radiation-sensitive residues such as aspartate or glutamate either in the active site or in the coordination with metal ions might severely affect the outcome of the experiment, as the extent of damage can affect the binding of ligands and/or the occupancy of the metal ions. A series of 20 consecutive data sets collected from a single crystal of thaumatin, covering the same rotation range 0\u201390\u00b0 at a second-generation bending-magnet beamline, showed intensity variations as great as 300% for some reflections (Banumathi et al., 2004 \u25b8). In this case, the overall dose received by the crystal was approximately 3.4% of the Henderson limit for each data set (covering only a 90\u00b0 wedge). These data indicate that even a relatively small received dose can cause as much as a 10\u201315% variation in the intensity of some reflections between consecutive data sets, although not all reflections may be affected to this extent. The allowed variation owing to radiation damage is much more stringent for the case of anomalous phasing with very weak anomalous signal. Liu and coworkers proposed that for multi-crystal native SAD, a dose of 5 MGy is the upper limit for the data set from each individual crystal (Liu et al., 2014 \u25b8). In the case of PSPTO, PTO and HEWL the overall doses, as calculated by RADDOSE (Zeldin et al., 2013 \u25b8), are 0.10, 0.03 and 0.13 MGy, which are 0.5, 0.15 and 0.65% of the Henderson limit, respectively. For the low-intensity data set of HEWL, this value is only 0.02 MGy. These values indicate that the crystals experienced very minimal damage, and consequently the accumulated intensity error owing to radiation damage is also minimal. It should be noted that when collecting data for multi-crystal native SAD, the variation owing to non-isomorphism may not be insignificant; however, it has been shown that by properly choosing and merging compatible data sets, structures can be determined from weakly diffracting crystals (Liu et al., 2014 \u25b8). It appears that the accumulated error resulting from radiation damage is more serious than slight non-isomorphism between crystals.",

As expected, substructure solutions from merged data had a higher overall CCall/CCweak and PATFOM compared with other low-multiplicity data sets. Although there were a few overloads in the low-intensity data, the overall data completeness was close to 100% (Supplementary Fig. S3). To determine the minimum data required to determine the HEWL structure and to examine whether the high-intensity data contributed to successful phasing, we merged various wedges from the low- and high-intensity data. The multiplicity in these data sets was around 7.0 in most of them (Table 3 \u25b8) and phasing was almost universally successful, albeit with some difficulty for the data set where only high-intensity data were used, where almost 30% of the low-resolution data to 3.5 \u00c5 were missing owing to overloads; the overall I/\u03c3(I) for these data was nearly 40, whereas it was 50 for the low-exposure data. Although substructure solution was difficult when using the high-intensity data set alone (data set 5), the quality of the map was comparable to other HEWL data sets (Table 3 \u25b8). These observations highlight the contribution of missing reflections to the overall I/\u03c3(I), which in turn could determine the ease/success of phasing.",

While such indicators are very useful in most phasing experiments, they may not be fully accurate when dealing with very weak anomalous signal. One such indicator, the \u03c72 statistic provided by the HKL-2000 data-reduction program, is very useful for detecting the presence of anomalous signal at the time of data collection itself. The presence of anomalous signal results in a noticeable difference in \u03c72 plots with Friedel mates separated and Friedel mates merged, owing to the inequality in the intensities of Friedel mates, and this can be used as an initial indication of the presence of anomalous signal in the data. However, for very weak anomalous scatterers with Z \u2264 20, the \u03c72 statistic may not reliably report the presence of anomalous signal (Fig. 2 \u25b8). In a multi-crystal native SAD experiment, it was observed that data with higher multiplicity from multiple crystals produce better substructure solutions and final maps compared with data sets with better values for some of these indicators, including CC1/2, but with lower multiplicity (Liu et al., 2014 \u25b8).",

Fig. 3 \u25b8 shows the \u2329d\u2032\u2032/\u03c3\u232a values as calculated by SHELXD plotted against resolution for all of the proteins along with the values corresponding to selenomethionine-derivatized putative glucarate dehydratase from Acidamino\u00adcoccus sp.

The CC1/2(anom) values for all three data sets clearly indicate significant anomalous signal extending to at least 3.0 \u00c5 resolution (Fig. 4 \u25b8). Since the data sets were collected at 1.74 and 0.979 \u00c5, respectively, for PTO and PSPTO (f\u2032\u2032 values of 1.6 and 0.56, respectively, for Ca atoms), it was expected that higher CC1/2(anom) values would be observed for PTO compared with PSPTO. Surprisingly, CC1/2(anom) did not vary between the two data sets (Fig. 4 \u25b8), underscoring the suggestion that in cases with very weak anomalous signal this metric might not fully predict the likelihood of succeeding in substructure solution and phasing. However, consistent with the CC1/2(anom) values, both of the data sets produced maps with similar quality (Table 4 \u25b8).",

The quality of the phases obtained from these data was not superior to those obtained from the HEWLAll data set (Table 4 \u25b8), where the wavelength for data collection was 1.075 \u00c5 and anomalous contribution was from S atoms, with sulfur having an f\u2032\u2032 value of 0.28 e at this wavelength.

However, HEWL has a higher overall I/\u03c3(I) (Table 1 \u25b8), indicating that while the collection of redundant data is critical for successful phasing, redundancy should not be achieved at the expense of overall data strength. It should be noted that most successful cases of multi-data-set native SAD experiments at low resolution were from strongly diffracting crystals having an overall I/\u03c3(I) of around 50 and high symmetry (Weinert et al., 2015 \u25b8; Liu et al., 2014 \u25b8).",

The anomalous_signal tool within the PHENIX suite based on this framework estimates the probability P(Substr) that the substructure can be found, the signal strength and the likely figure of merit of phasing (if the substructure is found). P(Substr) as calculated by the tool for different resolution cutoffs varies between 26 and 99%, 26 and 76% and 22 and 79% for the PSPTO, PTO and HEWLAll data sets, respectively. The signal as provided by the tool varies from 3.7 to 17.0, from 4.4 to 12.0 and from 1.7 to 12.9 for PSPTO, PTO and HEWLAll, respectively. Comparing this with the selenomethionine case of PDB entry 4hyr, P(Substr) varies from 32 to 100% and the signal varies from 6.0 to 32.1. For data set 5 of HEWL, P(Substr) and the signal vary from 22 to 74% and from 1.7 to 11.0, respectively, which are comparable to those for HEWLAll, but the substructure solution required several attempts, as detailed in the previous section. Terwilliger et al.

Firstly, calculation of anomalous difference Fourier maps with refined phases would help in the accurate assignment of bound atoms. In two of the cases presented here, although the wavelength used was around 1.0 \u00c5, the anomalous difference Fourier peaks varied between 30 and 5\u03c3 (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S5 illustrates this for HEWL) depending on the anomalous scatterer and the B factor of these atoms. It appears that strongly bound atoms with Z > 15 can be assigned from the strength of the anomalous difference Fourier peaks together with the coordination geometry/environment around the bound atoms, even from data collected using a wavelength of \u223c1.0 \u00c5. Secondly, in fortuitous cases unexpected anomalous signal can be used for phasing the structure de novo where the starting model is of poor quality (for example, using anomalous signal from Cd2+ acquired from the crystallization solution for experimental phasing, as reported in McClelland et al., 2016 \u25b8).",
