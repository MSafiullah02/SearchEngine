Generally, an asthma exacerbation is considered to be an increase in a patient's asthma symptoms with increasingly impaired lung function that require increased medication, an unscheduled visit to a physician or hospitalization. A single asthma exacerbation requiring extra medication and possibly emergency treatment and hospitalization can increase the annual treatment costs by more than threefold (3) . Recurrent asthma exacerbations lead to a progressive decline in lung function (4) , and the risk of an exacerbation doubles in children who have had one or more in the previous year (5) . A rare but distinct phenotype of asthma exacerbation is characterized by the development of sudden severe asthma symptoms in an otherwise mild or asymptomatic asthmatic subject, which may be triggered by an allergen, drug (e.g. aspirin), food, air pollutant, occupational agent, virus infection or, in many cases, an unknown (or unidentified) trigger (6) . It has been proposed that within the group of patients with recurrent exacerbations, detailed phenotyping in terms of clinical symptoms, lung function, inflammatory and other biomarkers is warranted (7, 8) .

A consensus is emerging that patients should be considered to have a 'difficultto-control asthma' if they have persistent symptoms and recurrent exacerbations despite being prescribed therapy at the highest steps of the guidelines' pharmacological management (12) . However, it is worth emphasizing that the guidelines also make clear that 'difficult-to-control asthma' is multifactorial, and issues such as incorrect diagnosis, comorbid conditions, nonadherence to prescribed medication, psychosocial morbidity and a number of other factors discussed later in this manuscript are major causes of 'difficult' asthma (12) . Patients should be considered to have severe asthma that is resistant to currently available therapies only following a detailed analysis and appropriate management of all these background problems that are amenable to intervention.

The treatment strategy of these authors was to (i) treat patients with sputum eosinophil counts of >2% with the minimal ICS dose required to reduce sputum eosinophil counts to normal and (ii) consider other treatment options in patients with normal sputum eosinophil counts, such as treatment of airway obstruction with long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist, or treatment of neutrophilic inflammation with antibiotics. Of interest, a treatment approach aimed at specifically reducing airway eosinophils using a monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin (IL)-5 reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients with severe asthma and persisting airway eosinophilia (32, 33) .

Airway remodelling is associated with poor clinical outcomes amongst asthmatic patients, but the pathophysiological relevance of, and the effect of treatment on, airway remodelling is unclear (99) .

Inflammatory and structural changes typical of asthma, such as airway eosinophilia and angiogenesis, have been observed not only in children with asthma but also in atopic children without asthma, raising the possibility that some of these pathological lesions may be associated with atopy even in the absence of asthmatic symptoms.
