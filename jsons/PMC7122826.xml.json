Many enzymes involved in epigenetic modulation of chromatin have been identified. These include DNA methyltransferases and DNA demethylases; histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases; and lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases. DNA methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors [3]. Histone acetylation influences histone/DNA interactions in the nucleosome and perturbs histone/histone interactions [4]. Acetyl groups can also serve as a platform for recruitment of histone acetylation readers to participate in gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair or chromatin condensation [5]. Histone lysine methylation on histones H3 and H4 has been implicated in heterochromatin formation and the regulation of promoter activity [6, 7]. Dysregulation of epigenetic modifications is associated with various human diseases, such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders [8, 9].",

The post-translational modification of histone acetylation is a key mechanism that regulates chromatin organization, and several studies have focused on the important function of BRD4 in regulating chromatin structure [12\u201315]. The histone acetyltransferase activity of BRD4 is responsible for maintaining normal chromatin structure [16]. BRD4 is critical in the maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure, and inhibition of BRD4 leads to chromatin decondensation and fragmentation [17]. Another study has demonstrated that a short isoform of BRD4 lacking the histone acetyltransferase domain can recruit the condensing II remodeling complex, thus forming a closed chromatin structure [18]. Otherwise, BRD4 can de-compact chromatin and facilitate transcriptional re-activation [19]. BRD4 acetylates histone H3 at the K122 residue, thereby perturbing a salt bridge and leading to nucleosome instability [16]. Thus, the mechanism by which BRD4 contributes to chromatin structure is likely to be complex and context-specific.",

            "text": "Detection of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol by germline-encoded DNA sensors is a central mechanism of innate immune defense against infection in most organisms [20]. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a predominant and general sensor of cytosolic DNA [21]. Upon binding of cGAS to dsDNA in the cytosol, cGAS enzymatic activity triggers the generation of 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic GMP-AMP (2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP) from GTP and ATP [21, 22]. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) binds 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP and undergoes a large conformational change [23, 24], thus enabling the recruitment of TANK binding kinase (TBK1) to STING; TBK1 further phosphorylates interferon (IFN)-regulated factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB, thus resulting in the expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines [25]. Damage-associated cytosolic dsDNA released from the mitochondria or nucleus also activates innate immunity through the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway [26\u201329]. At present, no reports have suggested that BRD4 is involved in antiviral innate immunity.",

We used a recombinant pseudorabies virus expressing a GFP reporter (PRV-GFP) to assess viral replication under treatment with these inhibitors in vitro (Fig 1B). The inhibitor of JMJD2, ML324, which has been reported to have potent anti-viral activity against both herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegaloviral infection [30], also showed a significant inhibitory effect toward PRV-GFP infection (Fig 1C). Inhibition of lysine methyltransferase by A196, EPZ-6438 and GSK503 decreased the rate of PRV-GFP-positive cells, thus suggesting that histone methylation is essential for PRV infection (Fig 1D\u20131F). In addition, PRV-GFP replication declined in cells treated with the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin but not the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (Fig 1G and 1H). The inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases 5-Azacytidine inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in vitro [31], whereas we found that treatment with 5-Azacytidine markedly promoted PRV-GFP replication (Fig 1I).",

To validate the specificity of BRD4 inhibitors, we depleted BRD4 with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA; shBRD4) in PK15 cells (Fig 1M). Knockdown of BRD4 also decreased the rate of PRV-GFP-positive cells (Fig 1N).

The proliferation rate of PK15, scrambled control shRNA (Scramble), shBRD4-1 and shBRD4-2 cells was nearly the same, thus suggesting that down-regulation of BRD4 did not influence cell growth (Fig 2C). Because BRD4 inhibitors induce apoptosis of some cancer cells [32\u201334], we then assessed cell cycle progression and apoptosis when BRD4 was inhibited. We found that cells expressing low levels of BRD4 accumulated in G1 phase (Fig 2D).

As expected, pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 by JQ-1, OTX-015 and I-BET 151 exerted anti-viral activities against DNA viruses, such as PRV, HSV1 and ECTV, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3A\u20133C and S2A\u2013S2C Fig). Moreover, treatment of cells with BRD4 inhibitors decreased the replication of RNA viruses including VSV, PRRSV, NDV and H1N1 (Fig 3D and 3E, S2D\u2013S2G Fig). We further determined the replication of PRV and VSV in Scramble, shBRD4-1 and shBRD4-2 PK15 cells. Knockdown of BRD4 caused significant attenuation of both PRV and VSV infection (Fig 3F and 3G).

To rule out the possibility that BRD4 inhibitors might influence the viral envelope and inhibit viral attachment, we pre-treated PRV with BRD4 inhibitors at 37\u00b0C for 2 h and performed dialysis to remove the compounds. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that treatment of PRV with DMSO, JQ-1, OTX-015 and I-BET 151 did not alter viral attachment (S3A Fig). Immunoblotting analysis of PRV glycoprotein E (gE) indicated that BRD4 inhibitors decreased PRV attachment to cells (Fig 5D), a finding verified by immunofluorescence analysis (S3B Fig). Furthermore, we labeled the genomes of PRV and ECTV with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and examined viral attachment with Apollo staining. When cells were treated with JQ-1, OTX-015 and I-BET 151, the cell fluorescence intensity of either PRV or ECTV was significantly weaker than that of control cells or cells treated with DMSO (Fig 5E and 5F).",

We assessed the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in HEK293 and RAW264.7 cells treated with JQ-1 for 0\u201336 h. By RT-qPCR analysis, we found that both IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNAs were stimulated by JQ-1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig 6A and 6B). Because IRF3 contributes to IFN-\u03b2 induction, we examined IFN-\u03b2 expression in IRF3-/- PK15 cells to determine whether the JQ-1 triggered IFN-\u03b2 expression was dependent on IRF3. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that although JQ-1 induced IFN-\u03b2 expression in PK15 cells, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in IRF3-/- cells did not respond to JQ-1 treatment (Fig 6C). We also detected the expression of IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and found that the pattern of ISG15 expression in PK15 and IRF3-/- cells was similar to that of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig 6C). We further assessed the expression of IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2 and ISG15 in PK15 cells with BRD4 knockdown. In agreement with the results after JQ-1 treatment, BRD4 knockdown enhanced IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2 and ISG15 mRNA expression (Fig 6D). Furthermore, IFN-\u03b2 secretion in the culture medium of shBRD4-1 and shBRD4-2 PK15 cells was significantly greater than that in the culture medium of PK15 and IRF3\u2212/\u2212 cells, as assessed with ELISA (Fig 6E). After JQ-1 treatment, compared with DMSO treatment, PK15 cells generated more IFN-\u03b2 (Fig 6E). The IFN-\u03b2 secretion from IRF3\u2212/\u2212, shBRD4-1 and shBRD4-2 PK15 cells treated with JQ-1 was approximately equal to that from cells treated with DMSO (Fig 6E). We treated HEK293 cells with JQ-1 and further assessed innate immune activation with immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig 6F, phosphorylation of IRF3, P65 and STAT1 was up-regulated when cells were challenged with JQ-1 for 24 h, thus suggesting that innate immunity and IFN signaling were activated.",

We observed that JQ-1 treatment induced condensed the structure of cGAS, some of which co-localized with cytosolic dsDNA, thus suggesting potential cGAS activation (Fig 8A). Furthermore, through RT-qPCR analysis in PK15 cells with ablation of cGAS, STING and TBK1, we found that JQ-1-triggered IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 expression was abolished (S4A and S4B Fig). We next analyzed the activation of the cGAS/STING/TBK1 axis through immunoblotting. As shown in Fig 8B, JQ-1 treatment induced phosphorylation of TBK1 in HEK293 cells. cGAS expression was up-regulated by JQ-1 treatment, possibly because cGAS is an ISG (Fig 8B) [42]. STING expression was decreased by JQ-1 treatment, possibly because STING can be degraded through an autophagy pathway [43]. A similar phenomenon was also observed in PK15 cells (Fig 8C and 8D). In contrast, HEK293T cells, which lack STING [44], exhibited no phosphorylation of TBK1 in response to JQ-1 treatment (Fig 8B). Ablation of cGAS and STING also abolished JQ-1 induced phosphorylation of TBK1 in PK15 cells (Fig 8C and 8D). BRD4 silencing enhanced phosphorylation of TBK1 and cGAS expression and perturbed STING expression (Fig 8E). cGAS mRNA, but not STING mRNA, was up-regulated in cells with BRD4 knockdown (Fig 8F).",

Finally, we investigated the role of the cGAS/STING/TBK1 axis in JQ-1-induced antiviral activity. Viral titration indicated that ablation of cGAS, STING and TBK1 enhanced PRV and VSV infection in cells treated either with DMSO or with JQ-1, thus suggesting that the cGAS-mediated innate immune pathway was required for the antiviral role of JQ-1 (Fig 8I and 8J).

Mice were intraperitoneally injected with JQ-1 for 0\u20133 days (Fig 9A). In agreement with our in vitro data, the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA in mouse lungs was significantly enhanced by JQ-1 injection (Fig 9B and 9C). The levels of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 were up-regulated in the serum in mice injected from 2 day post JQ-1injection (Fig 9D and 9E). These data indicated that BRD4 inhibition activated the innate immune response in vivo. We then challenged mice with PRV-QXX and examined the protective role of JQ-1. We found that the mortality of mice injected with JQ-1 was significantly lower than that of mice injected with DMSO (Fig 9F). The PRV load was much higher in the lungs in control mice than JQ-1-injected mice, on the basis of RT-qPCR analysis of the viral genome (Fig 9G). Furthermore, we detected the inhibitory effect of JQ-1 on VSV-GFP infection in vivo (Fig 9H). The replication of the VSV genome in mouse lung, spleen and liver was markedly inhibited in response to JQ-1 treatment (Fig 9I\u20139K). Lung injury caused by PRV and VSV infection was greatly attenuated upon JQ-1 treatment, because less infiltration of inflammatory cells was detected in the lungs in JQ-1-treated mice than DMSO-treated mice (Fig 9L). These results revealed that BRD4 inhibition exerts antiviral activity in vivo.",

However, the effects of BRD4 on the maintenance of global chromatin structure vary in different contexts, and whether BRD4 is involved in antiviral innate immunity is elusive. Here, we report that BRD4 inhibition induces cellular genomic instability and increases in the levels of cytoplasmic DNA, which in turn promotes the secretion of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines through cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 signaling, thus exhibiting broad antiviral activity through attenuation of viral attachment (Fig 10). Beyond cGAS, a number of cytoplasmic DNA sensors have been identified, such as DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factor and DEAD box polypeptide 41 [45]. Because cGAS is the predominant and general sensor of cytosolic DNA [21], and cGAS knockout blocked the antiviral effectors in response to BRD4 inhibition (Fig 8C\u20138H), other DNA sensors did not play a significant role in our experimental context.",

DAPI staining and micrococcal nuclease assays suggested that treatment of cells with BRD4 inhibitors caused chromatin decompaction and fragility (Fig 7B\u20137G). Bowry et al. have indicated that BET inhibitors activate RAD51, thus slowing replication forks and suppressing DNA damage [46]. However, other researchers have indicated that BRD4 inhibition decreases RAD51 expression and homologous recombination repair, thus potentially inducing DNA damage in prostate and breast cancer cells [47, 48]. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that BRD4 inhibition induces the DDR. First, DNA comet assays showed that DNA injury occurred in cells with BRD4 knockdown or BRD4 inhibitor treatment (Fig 7C\u20137F). Second, immunofluorescence analysis of \u03b3-H2AX demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition resulted in double-strand DNA breaks (Fig 7H and 7I).",

Another possible reason is that P53 is not activated under treatment with BRD4 inhibitors (S1C Fig). Consistent with this possibility, JQ-1 treatment has been found not to activate P53 and P21 in primary pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [52].

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that BRD4 facilitates viral infection through regulation of viral gene transcription [53, 54]. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition attenuates attachment of a range of viruses (Fig 5). IFNs induce the expression of ISGs through the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. In each cell, 500 to 1,000 ISGs are induced and subsequently block multiple stages of the viral life cycle [55, 56]. Our previous study has demonstrated that porcine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is regulated by IFNs, and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) inhibits PRV entry [57]. CH25H expression is also induced in response to infection with Zika virus, Singapore grouper iridovirus and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus, and subsequently blocks viral attachment by 25HC [58, 59]. Moreover, the IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM) located on the plasma membrane and endosomes have been reported to exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity [60, 61]. IFITM proteins may modulate the fluidity of cellular membranes and interfere with a step in viral replication preceding fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [62]. Because BRD4 inhibition activates IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig 6A\u20136E), we postulate that CH25H or IFITM proteins may be up-regulated to inhibit viral attachment when BRD4 is inhibited. Of course, other ISGs may participate in BRD4 inhibition-induced antiviral activity.",

            "text": "Several studies have suggested that BRD4 positively regulates inflammatory gene expression. I-BET inhibits the expression of key inflammatory genes in activated macrophages and primary human monocytes [63, 64]. Deletion of BRD4 promotes I\u03baB\u03b1 transcription and influences LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production in bone marrow-derived macrophages [65]. In addition, BRD4 binds the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and facilitates IFN-\u03b2 expression [66]. However, we found that BRD4 inhibition triggers the innate immune response through the cGAS-STING pathway (Fig 8). Harnessing innate immunity is emerging as a new possibility for cancer therapy [67]. The intrinsic relevance of STING-associated signaling in tumorigenesis has been a recent concern of oncologists, and STING agonists have been tested in early clinical trials [68, 69]. Moreover, BRD4 is largely acknowledged for its roles in organization of super-enhancers and oncogene expression in cancer [70, 71]. We suggest another beneficial effect of BRD4 inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy.",
