According to Cardy et al .

This is in contrast with the clinical presentation of dogs with spinal MUO, which was characterised by an acute onset of progressive and mainly symmetrical neurological deficits, with pain on spinal palpation or manipulation in 86% of dogs (Cardy et al . 2015 ) , which is comparable with the 71% of dogs presenting with spinal hyperaesthesia in the current study.

Although clinical signs can vary, affected animals most typically present with ambulatory paraparesis and ataxia, localising to T3 to L3 spinal cord segments. MRI typically reveals an extensive, ill-defined and intramedullary lesion that appears hyperintense on T2W images and isointense on T1W images. Most lesions showed parenchymal contrast enhancement and/or enhancement of the overlying meninges on post-contrast T1W images which can possibly differentiate dogs with MUO from other more common spinal diseases. In 10% of cases, no lesion was visible on sagittal T2W and T1W images.
