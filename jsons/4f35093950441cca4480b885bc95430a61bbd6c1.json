            "text": "The reproductive biology of wild Canis species is often described as unique among mammals because an unusual combination of behavioral and physiological characteristics including a seasonally monestrous cycle, copulatory lock or tie, obligatory pseudopregnancy, social monogamy, and biparental care of the young. We investigated social behavior, endocrine profiles, and vaginal cytology of female coyotes (Canis latrans) during 4 breeding seasons, 2000-2003. Blood levels of estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and relaxin were measured, and mating behavior and changes in vaginal epithelium were documented. After aligning the data from each individual to her estimated day of ovulation, we compared pregnant coyotes with nonpregnant females and evaluated temporal relationships among hormone levels, behavior, and vaginal cytology. We found that patterns of proceptive and receptive behaviors correlated with the secretion of steroid hormones, as did vaginal epithelial cytomorphosis. In addition, although progesterone levels of pregnant and pseudopregnant coyotes were indistinguishable, prolactin demonstrated a discernible intergroup difference and relaxin was only detectable in pregnant females. Although this study included characteristics not previously published for this species, it also showed how key aspects of reproduction were correlated temporally, and emphasized the importance of an integrated perspective when addressing the reproductive biology of coyotes, or other wild species of canids.",

They are seasonally monestrus (Gier 1968; Hamlett 1938; Kennelly and Johns 1976; Stellflug et al. 1981) , socially monogamous, and territorial (Andelt 1985; Bekoff and Wells 1986; Bromley and Gese 2001; Camenzind 1978; Gese 2001) . Once bonded, a coyote pair remains together for an indefinite number of years, sharing responsibility for territory maintenance. Litters averaging 3-7 pups are typically born March-May in most North American latitudes after a gestation of 60-63 days (Gier 1968; Hamlett 1938; Kennelly et al. 1977; Knowlton 1972 ) and both parents participate in the care and rearing of young (Andelt 1985; Camenzind 1978; Gier 1968; Hatier 1995; Mengel 1971; Silver and Silver 1969) .",

Mate acquisition, conception, gestation, and parental care rely upon effective synchronization of physiological processes, anatomical modifications, and social behaviors. During 4 consecutive breeding seasons (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) we measured the levels of estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and relaxin in coyote sera and plasma. Concurrently, samples of exfoliated vaginal epithelium were collected in proestrus, estrus, and diestrus, and examined microscopically; observations of mating behavior also were documented. The data were then aligned to each individual female's estimated day of ovulation. Females housed with their mates (and that became pregnant) were compared to a nonpregnant cohort (sequestered females). Herein, we describe our observations and findings, comparing pregnant coyotes with pseudopregnant females, but also examine associations among behavior, endocrine patterns, and vaginal cytology. Examination of our data suggests that important relationships exist between these factors, and integrated examinations of complex systems can increase our understanding to an extent that might not be accrued from simple experimental constructions.",

For coyotes in this study, estrus was the phase during which the female was receptive and cooperative with her mate's attempts to copulate, and the beginning of estrus was demarcated by the 1st observed copulatory tie (or sperm in the vaginal smear). Proestrus precedes estrus and is characterized by the presence of red blood cells in vaginal exudate. Diestrus immediately follows estrus and includes pregnancy and the protracted luteal phase of nonpregnant females. Luteal activity is typically prolonged in nonpregnant canids; and because the expression of progesterone is indistinguishable between pregnant and nonpregnant females, the latter are commonly described as pseudopregnant (Concannon et al. 1989; Feldman and Nelson 2004) . Accordingly, a coyote was described as pseudopregnant if there was a marked and sustained elevation of serum progesterone after ovulation. Pseudopregnancy was assumed to be covert and subclinical (i.e., no mammary development, lactation, or denning behavior) unless otherwise noted. After parturition, or regression of the corpora lutea, hormone synthesis diminishes and anestrus follows diestrus.",

Subsequent color development was directly associated with presence or absence of relaxin in the sample. Absorbance was measured photometrically, and an optical density . 0.050 (minimum threshold for a positive result) was adopted to distinguish between pregnancy and pseudopregnancy in the coyote. It was also important to note that relaxin persisted in peripheral blood after parturition and could not reliably predict abortion in coyotes (Carlson and Gese 2007) .",

The influence of steroid hormones on preovulatory copulations also cannot be ruled out. Progesterone levels in coyotes began rising before ovulation and were positively correlated with copulations. Furthermore, estradiol followed by progesterone has been linked to expression of sexual behavior in the domestic dog (Concannon et al. 1979) .

However, these results are not surprising when one considers the male's role in mating behavior (and the influence testosterone certainly exerts during the breeding season). Regardless, the association between rising progesterone levels and overt sexual behavior reflects the female coyote's sexual determination. A male may shadow a female, investigate her anogenital scent, play, groom her, et cetera, but copulations will not occur without her permission and explicit cooperation.",

It has been hypothesized (but not yet established) that relaxin may serve as a signal between embryo and mother, possibly stimulating prolactin synthesis, which in turn facilitates the persistence of progesterone (required for the maintenance of pregnancy in canines- Concannon et al. 2001) .

Biologists studying wild or captive populations might find it helpful to focus on selected criteria when assessing a breeding population. The value of seeing a pair in a copulatory tie, viewing spermatozoa on a vaginal smear, or detecting pups in a den are obvious. However, in the absence of such indicators, investigators might depend instead upon the observation of affinitive and appetitive behaviors in coyotes. When blood samples can be obtained, measurement of blood hormone levels can provide evidence of ovulation, and distinguish pregnancy from pseudopregnancy. Also, the relative prevalence of exfoliated epithelial cells, red cells, leukocytes, and other inclusions on a vaginal smear can help predict the breeding status or reproductive potential of an animal. However, the use of several of these elements together will increase the overall confidence in determining the reproductive status of an individual, or population of coyotes.",
