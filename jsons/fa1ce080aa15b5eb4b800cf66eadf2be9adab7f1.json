From a pathophysiological approach, the key regulator of sepsis and especially septic shock is the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) which in turn triggers the over-expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (2).",

As an example, it has been shown that a single dose of Regarding the mentioned effects of antibiotic administration in the non-bacterial infectious situations, authors suggest that the administration of antibiotics in these patients should be proceeded very carefully to prevent any antibiotic-induced inflammatory storm. Also, clinicians may look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to reduce septic shock.",
