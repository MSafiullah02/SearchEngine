Increased disease burden, incidence, and societal fear undoubtedly render a pandemic influenza not only a public health problem but, potentially, a public health catastrophe.",

Polymerase chain reaction is also available for identification of the influenza strain.4 It is estimated that accurate diagnosis based on history and clinical findings approaches 70% when compared with virus isolation by cell culture,5 which is the definitive standard.6 Rapid, in-office diagnostic tests for influenza are available, some of which are waived from requirements under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and provide results in under 30 minutes, yielding reasonably good sensitivity (median, 70% to 75%) and excellent specificity (90% to 95%) compared with viral culture.7 Cough and fever within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms appears to be the best predictor of seasonal influenza infection, with a positive predictive value of 79% in adults8 and 83% in children older than 4.9\n",

Larger values of Ro imply that the disease can be disseminated easily within the population. If Ro is greater than 1, then it is vital that measures be taken within the population to control spread. But if Ro is less than 1, the disease may be best contained by tracking down and sequestering the infective individual(s) rather than placing burdens (such as mass vaccination) across the entire population.49 For a pandemic influenza, the Ro is estimated to be approximately 4 (as a frame of reference, malaria has an Ro of 1.6, and measles has an Ro of approximately 17).48, 50 Statistical models of Ro assume a homogenous population, and efforts have been made to refine the model to reflect the diversity of the U.S. population (e.g., age, sex, and vaccination status) to better identify more effective control measures for various subpopulations.51\n",

There are 2 current classes of antiviral influenza medications based on mechanism of action. One inhibits the active site of the neuraminidase (NA) enzyme (an enzyme vital to releasing progeny viruses inside the host) and the other inhibits the matrix protein M2 proton pump of the influenza virus (a step required for viral uncoating inside the host cell).62 M2 proton pump inhibitors include amantadine and rimantadine; both have been used in the treatment of influenza for more than 4 decades.63 Neuraminidase inhibitors include oseltamivir and zanamivir. Both classes of anti-influenza medication appear to be effective in decreasing the severity of disease for those already infected (by up to 60%) as well as in preventing onset of influenza when used prophylactically (by up to 85%), although only oseltamivir is approved in the United States for prophylactic use.62, 63, 64 Oseltamivir is most effective when administered within 48 hours of infection, and efficacy decreases rapidly by 60 hours postinfection. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae; Roche Laboratories, Nutley, New Jersey) can be administered orally, whereas zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) must be inhaled as a dry powder.21\n",
