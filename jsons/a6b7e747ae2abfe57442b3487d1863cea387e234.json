Up to November 2005, there were 20 confirmed cases of human H5N1 infection. Thirteen of these died. Most of the confirmed cases were solitary ones except for three persons in a single family, and epidemiological evidence indicated that person-to-person transmission may have been involved in this cluster. However, sequence analysis of the virus in the cluster did not suggest any changes that might enhance the viral ability to get transmitted among humans. H5N1 viruses in Thailand and Vietnam belong to a single lineage genetically and are antigenically distinguishable from the viruses of the same genotype Z from southern China and Indonesia. Despite the seemingly subsiding epidemic in Thailand, the problem is far from resolved. H5N1 viruses are still sporadically isolated from domestic poultry as well as from wildlife. More important, isolates were also found in asymptomatic animals. Natural selection may have adapted the virus to a less aggressive form. This would make the virus more elusive and difficult to control. A threat of a pandemic strain emerging from the H5N1 virus is still imminent.",

            "text": "On 23 January 2004, the first case of human H5N1 infection in Thailand was reported. It was a boy from Kanchanaburi, a province about 100 km west of Bangkok. He was admitted to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok and was diagnosed to have severe progressive pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, and respiratory samples were tested for influenza virus. The laboratory result showed that the patient harbored influenza virus, and sequencing of the viral RNA indicated that the virus belonged to the H5 subtype Puthavathana et al., 2005) . When this result was reported to the Ministry of Public Health, the government announced that there was a highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) outbreak in Thailand. The Department of Livestock Development (DLD) confirmed the presence of H5N1 viruses in poultry on the same day. Subsequent analysis of the virus from patients and animals confirmed that it was H5N1 AI virus of genotype Z and was closely related to the virus from Vietnam (Viseshakul et al., 2004; Puthavathana et al., 2005) . Figure 1 shows the time distribution of the outbreak in humans and poultry in Thailand (DLD, 2005a) . The outbreak activity has a clear seasonal variation. The disease activity starts at the beginning of the rainy season (July), peaks in October at the transition from the rainy season to winter, and subsides in March when summer starts. The first round of outbreaks in early 2004 was widely spread. Most of the outbreaks were in the central and lower northern regions of the country, along the major river basin, where poultry density is the highest, especially free-grazing ducks (Fig. 2) . Outbreaks in humans and poultry had similar time and geographical distributions, indicating poultry as the source of infection in humans. Repetitive outbreaks in same areas suggested that even though there was no apparent disease between the outbreaks, the virus remained resident either in domestic animals or wildlife in that area. The similarity of the viruses between the outbreaks further proved that latter outbreaks were caused by the remnant viruses from previous outbreaks and not by a reintroduced virus .",

Although the virus responsible for the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong was completely eliminated by a total depopulation of poultry on the island, the ancestral virus still circulated in southern China and gave rise to several genotypes by reassortment with other AI viruses. Since 1997, many of these genotypes have emerged, disappeared, and been replaced by other genotypes (Guan et al., 2002 . All the viruses in the outbreaks since 2004 belong to the genotype Z. This suggested that the genotype Z has the optimal genetic makeup for efficient spread among poultry. All Thailand isolates contain multiple basic amino acid substitutions at the protease cleavage site in the HA protein, a 20-codon deletion in the NA gene, and a 5-codon deletion in the NS gene, which are characteristics of the genotype Z viruses. Amino acid residues at the receptor-binding site of HA of human viruses were similar to those of chicken viruses. The presence of amantadine resistance in the Thailand viruses was indicated by a mutation in the M2 transmembrane protein and was phenotypically confirmed. The Thailand viruses contained more avianspecific residues than did the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 viruses, suggesting that the virus may have adapted to allow a more efficient spread in avian species (Viseshakul et al., 2004; Puthavathana et al., 2005) .",

Experiments in ducks demonstrated that only a single round of nonlethal infection in one host could exert enough selection pressure to cause an antigenic drift and reduce virulence . It is therefore likely that the endemic virus will gradually become less pathogenic in ducks, which is a natural host of influenza virus. Observation of the outbreak pattern in the third round (rainy season 2005) suggested that pathogenicity in other avian species may not be similar to what had been observed in the first round of outbreaks. In the latest outbreak, a smaller fraction of sick and dying animals was observed and more viruses were isolated from apparently healthy animals. Experimental data have shown that the viruses in 2005 were indeed less pathogenic in ducks Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2005) . Interestingly, the H5N1 viruses of 1997 were also nonpathogenic in ducks. The virus became pathogenic in ducks in 2002-2003 and reverted to a nonpathogenic strain in 2005 Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2005) . This probably indicated a temporary loss of the equilibrium between the virus and its natural host by the adaptation into a new host, that is, domestic poultry. The reduction of pathogenicity in 2005 suggested that the virus is setting a new equilibrium with its natural host.",

Because Thailand is a major poultry meat exporting country, direct loss in production caused by the outbreak and culling, the trade ban imposed by importing countries, and reduced domestic consumption caused severe economic loss in the industry. More than 62 million birds were either killed by the disease or culled for outbreak control (Tiensin et al., 2005) . The government compensated farmers for their losses. Farmers were entitled to compensation of 75% of the value of animals that were destroyed. Different sectors of the poultry industry vary in their practice of biosecurity and outbreak prevention. After the first outbreak, most large-scale industries improved biosecurity measures. Consequently, little problem remained in the large-scale industry sector in the second and third outbreaks. The major concern remains in the smallscale backyard farms of chickens and ducks, where it is very difficult to employ proper biosecurity. Another area of concern is the farms in the central part of Thailand, where paddy fields are plentiful. It is a common practice of free-grazing duck raising in Thailand to move flocks of ducks from field to field by trucks to let them feed on the dropped grains after the harvest. Flocks can move over a very long distance in search of a suitable feeding area. Because ducks can be infected and can shed virus without clinical sign, migrating flocks are ideal for spreading the disease Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2005) . The geographical distribution of the outbreaks coincided with the area with the highest density of free-grazing duck raising (Gilbert et al., 2006) . This further supports the belief that free-grazing ducks may have been a major source of the spread of disease.",

Most of the patients had a fever as the starting symptom followed by coughing, dyspnea, and pneumonia in a median time of 4 days. About half of the patients (53%) had rhinorrhea, 71% had sore throat, 53% had myalgia, and 41% had diarrhea (Chotpitayasunondh et al., 2005) . Abnormal chest radiographs in these patients included interstitial infiltration and patchy lobar infiltrates in a variety of patterns (single lobe, multiple lobes, unilateral, or bilateral distributions). In patients who developed ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), the radiographic pattern progressed to a diffuse bilateral ground-glass appearance (Beigel et al., 2005; Chotpitayasunondh et al., 2005) . An autopsy study showed that the lung, but not upper airway epithelium, was the site of viral replication, and the cellular target of the virus was the alveolar epithelial cell . The most remarkable laboratory findings in these patients were lymphopenia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. More importantly, the lymphocyte counts were significantly different between fatal cases and survivors and between patients with and without ARDS (Chotpitayasunondh et al., 2005) . This suggested that a simple blood count can not only help in the preliminary diagnosis of bird flu, but can also be used as a prognostic marker. Most of these patients were treated with Oseltamivir, but it is not clear whether the treatment changed the course of the illness.",

H5N1 AI viruses showed avian-type receptor specificity (Matrosovich et al., 1999; Gambaryan et al., 2004) . Nevertheless, they can infect humans. Infection by the H5N1 virus in humans is not efficient, and person-to-person transmission cannot readily occur. The inability of the virus to transmit from person to person is the only barrier preventing the virus from becoming a pandemic strain. Experimental data showed that only two substitutions in the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin gene are needed to change the receptor-binding preference of H5N1 virus from 2,3-to 2,6-\u03b1-linked sialic acid (Harvey et al., 2004) .

It was a cluster of three patients: a young girl, her mother, and her aunt. The girl and her aunt lived in Kamphaengphet where there was an AI outbreak in poultry. The mother lived in Nonthaburi, a province near Bangkok where there was no AI outbreak and did not have any contact with poultry. She went to take care of her sick daughter 1 day before the girl died. The mother had an onset of fever 4 days later, went back to Nonthaburi, had pneumonia, and died 14 days later. The aunt who also took care of the sick girl also developed pneumonia 8 days after the girl's death. Although she had contact with a dead chicken, the last exposure was 17 days before the onset of fever, which was too long for an incubation period of influenza. Because the mother and the aunt had no contact with poultry within a time interval compatible with an incubation period of influenza and the time of onset after exposure to the index case was compatible with the incubation period of AI, it was concluded that the two cases were likely to contract the disease from the index case . As soon as this cluster was recognized, effort was made to contain possible further person-to-person transmission. All household members, other family contacts, exposed neighbors, and exposed health care workers were placed under active surveillance for fever and respiratory symptoms for 14 days. Fortunately, there was no further transmission or evidence that the virus in this cluster facilitated more efficient human-to-human transmission. However, if the virus is allowed to transmit from humans to humans without interruption, it is likely that it will eventually evolve to become more transmissible in humans. It is therefore crucial that every effort has to be made to prevent human-to-human transmission.",

The exposure that led to the infection was mostly from feeding on the carcasses of infected poultry. The infection caused severe disease, with high mortality in these animals. Experimental infections were also reported in cats, mice, ferrets, monkey, and pigs (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001 Kuiken et al., 2003 Kuiken et al., , 2004 Govorkova et al., 2005; Maines et al., 2005) . Most of these animals presented severely fatal disease manifestations except for pigs, in which the infection caused only mild disease (Choi et al., 2005) . Nevertheless, the virulence of H5N1 virus in mammals is probably heterogeneous among strains and is continuously evolving. Experimental data suggested that the virus is evolving to become more pathogenic in mammals and that the genetic determinants of virulence lie in the polymerase genes, resulting in a high-replication phenotype Li et al., 2005) . This further emphasized the danger of this virus and suggested that it may also become more pathogenic and transmissible in humans.",

Clusters of pneumonia and pneumonia in hospital personnel are also the targets of surveillance and disease control in order to detect human-to-human transmission of severe influenza of pandemic potential. Emphasis has been made to detect any potential pandemic strain as early as possible. Recent studies using computer simulation predicted that early detection and proper outbreak control by social distancing measures and antiviral drugs may be effective in containing the outbreak and eliminating the potential pandemic virus provided the virus does not have a greater ability to get transmitted than does the previous pandemic strains, that is, it has a basic reproductive number below 1.6-1.8 (Ferguson et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005) . The amount of the antiviral drug Oseltamivir that should be enough for the elimination of a potential pandemic virus has been predicted differently between the two studies: 100,000 to 1 million and 3 million courses (Ferguson et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005) . Having that in mind, the Ministry of Public Health has started to stockpile Oseltamivir, and as of October 2005, the amount stockpiled is 72,500 courses (725,000 tablets).",

With the changing phenotype of the virus towards lower virulence in ducks, the vaccination policy may need to be reconsidered, because without vaccination the ducks will be asymptomatically infected as well and vaccination is effective in reducing the level of viral shedding . A previous report showing the ability of vaccination to abort an outbreak in a chicken farm strongly supports the use of the vaccine in adjunction to biosecurity measures .",
