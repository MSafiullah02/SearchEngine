            "text": "The laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, is within the order Rodentia and family Muridae. The genus Rattus contains more than 130 species; however, the Norway rat, R. norvegicus, and the black rat, R. rattus, are the 2 species most commonly associated with the genus. Rattus rattus preceded R. norvegicus in migration from Asia to Europe and the Americas by several hundred years. The former species reached Europe in the twelfth century, and the Americas in the sixteenth century; whereas R. norvegicus emerged in the eighteenth century in Europe and in the nineteenth century in the Western Hemisphere. Globally, the Norway rat has largely displaced the black rat, probably because of the Norway rat's larger size and aggressiveness. The domestication and introduction of the albino R. norvegicus is rooted by its use in Europe and America in the 1800s as prey for a sport (rat baiting) in which individuals would wager on which terrier dog would most swiftly kill the largest number of rats confined to a pit. Because of the need for large numbers of rats for this sport, wild rats were purpose-bred, and albinos were selected out by some people as a hobby (Robinson, 1965). The first reported use of the rat in an experiment, in 1856, has been credited to J. M. Philipeaux, who studied the effects of adrenalectomy in albino rats (Richter, 1954). Rats were used in experiments only sporadically in Europe and the United States until about 1890. Pivotal to the development of the rat for use in research was H. H. Donaldson, who at the Wistar Institute did much to produce and define early stocks of laboratory rats (Lindsey, 1979).",

Characteristics such as a short gestation and a relatively short life span, a docile behavior, and ready availability of animals with well-defined health and genetic backgrounds are responsible for the importance of the rat as a laboratory animal. The rat is a standard species for toxicological, teratological, and carcinogenesis testing by the pharmaceutical industry and governmental agencies. Its early use in behavioral, neurological, nutritional, and endocrinology studies continues today. The size of the rat enables it to be used for surgical procedures, varying from organ transplantation to vascular techniques. Although the number of commonly used inbred strains is dwarfed by those of the mouse, inbred rat strains do represent an important repertoire of disease models (Table I\n).",

            "text": "Rooms in which rats are to be housed should meet the guidelines of the \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u201d (National Research Council, 1996a). Wall, ceiling, and floor surfaces should be made of materials that allow for effective sanitation and that are resistant to damage from normal use and manipulation of equipment. The environment of the room should be well controlled, to ensure animal well-being and to help limit variables to those of the experimental design. Although rats, like most other species, can adapt to changes in temperature and humidity, room temperatures within a range of 70\u00b0\u201376\u00b0 F and with a relative humidity of 30\u201370% are typically accepted as being appropriate. Twenty-four-hour temperature/humidity recorders, either located in animal rooms or as a component of an electronic environmental management system, are useful in detecting changes in environmental conditions. Practice over many years has shown that, in general, ventilation rates of 10\u201315 air changes/hr of fresh air are sufficient to compensate for heat load and the generation of NH3 and CO2 from animals. A stable photoperiod is necessary to avoid changes in reproductive behavior, food intake, and weight gain. A cycle of 12 to 14 hr light and 10 to 12 hr dark is typically used for rats. Rats are particularly susceptible to phototoxic retinopathy. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that light intensity at cage level should be between 130 and 300 lux to prevent retinopathy (National Research Council, 1996a,b).",

Strategies for limiting the transfer of pathogens will vary according to the potential impact that infectious agents may have on a particular group of rats and the study in which they are being used. For instance, an appropriate-sized room or cubicle may reflect the space necessary to separate rats by such criteria as pathogen status, immunological status, vendor, protocol, or investigator. Modifications such as the incorporation of Class 100 flexible wall enclosures may be useful to help ensure the specific pathogen status of rats over an extended period of time. Because of stress produced by noise, rat rooms should be located distant from mechanical rooms, cage washing centers, and species that are apt to produce noise (National Research Council, 1996b).",

This will help prevent pododermatitis and injuries that are more frequently associated with wire floors (National Research Council, 1996b), and bedding within solid-bottom cages provides environmental enrichment. The most frequently used materials for solid-bottom cages are polycarbonate and polypropylene. The former plastic is often preferred because it may be repeatedly autoclaved without damage and because its translucency allows for observation of animals. Various contact bedding materials are appropriate for rats (e.g., hardwood chips, ground corncob, cellulose sheets).",

The Harderian gland secretes porphyrin in excessive amounts, termed chromodacryorrhea, when the animal is stressed (e.g., because of malnutrition, dehydration, disease, or environmental factors). Accordingly, a reddish secretion or crust located periorbitally and at the nares may be a useful indicator of illness or a husbandry problem (Moore, 1995). The orbital venous sinus beneath the medial aspect of the orbit is a useful site for blood collection in the anesthetized animal. It has been accepted that rats lack color vision; however, one recent study suggests that rats may have dichromatic color vision (Koolhass, 1999).",

This class of diet can be either an open-formula diet, in which the information on the amount of each ingredient is available, or a closed-formula diet, in which such information is held confidential by the producer. The nutrient composition of ingredients in natural-ingredient diets varies from batch to batch because of various factors (e.g., relative costs of grains, weather conditions, harvesting and storage conditions, and concentrations of contaminants). Certified, natural-ingredient diets are used for toxicological and other Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies because each lot is assayed and certified not to exceed established maximum concentrations of a set list of contaminants (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and estrogens) that could influence study results.",

These effects have been found in Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and F-344 rats and have caused increased variability among 2-year carcinogenicity and safety assessment studies, compromising the usefulness of bioassays in risk assessment (Keenan et al., 1996). For instance, Wistar rats fed 80% of ad libitum beginning at 16 weeks of age had very significant reductions in the incidence of lung, mammary, pancreatic islet cell, and pituitary tumors relative to controls fed ad libitum. The overall incidence of malignant tumors was 16% in the feed-limited group and 37% in the ad libitum group, even though the feed-limited group had a greater longevity. There was also a reduction in chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the heart, acute inflammation of the prostate, radiculoneuropathy, and acinal hyperplasia of the mammary gland in feed-limited animals (Roe et al., 1995).",

Interestingly, on histologic examination of young rat testes, more degenerate germ cells are noted prior to 75 days of age than afterward, indicative of the poor efficiency of spermatogenesis at early ages in the rat (Russell et al., 1987). Male sexual behavior is, in part, dependent on age and experience. Prepubertal males have no preference for females in estrus, and female-oriented sexual behavior is reported to decrease after 150 days of age (Matuszczyk et al., 1994; Smith et al, 1992). Decreased serum testosterone may be partially responsible for age-related decreases in mating behavior, but this does not appear to completely explain the phenomenon.",

Multiple series of intromissions and ejaculations occur, usually about seven, with increasing refractory periods between successive episodes.

Rats in estrus often exhibit specific behavior, including ear quivering when the back or head are stroked, and lordosis (\u201csway-back\u201d posture) when the pelvic area is stimulated (Blandau et al., 1941). Additionally, the vulva becomes swollen, and the vaginal wall appears dry in estrus, instead of the moist pink appearance during metestrus or diestrus. This is due to cornification of the vaginal epithelium during estrus (Baker, 1979). These changes in the vaginal epithelium can be assessed by cytologic examination of vaginal smears (Montes and Luque, 1988). In estrus, 25\u2013100% of the epithelial cells are cornified (Bennett and Vickery, 1970). Changes in vaginal fluids and cytology also lead to changes in the electrical impedance in the vagina during estrus. This has been widely exploited as a more precise method of estrus detection (Koto et al., 1987a, b), using a device referred to as an impedance meter in which an electrical probe is inserted into the vagina.",

            "text": "Litter size varies with stock, strain, source, and maternal age. The following are examples of the effect of maternal age. Wistar BH rats had an average of 1.69 more pups (11.80 vs. 10.11) when first mated at 105 days than when first mated at 35 days of age (Rosen et al., 1987). The second litter is usually the largest (Bennett and Vickery, 1970). After 9 months of age, litter size is further decreased, and the pregnancy rate declines after 12 months of age (Niggeschulze and Kast, 1994). Loss of fetuses, termed pregnancy wastage, occurs as a function of age (Mattheij and Swarts, 1991), with less than 5% wastage in 4-month-old rats, 30% in 9-month-old rats, and 65% at 11 months of age. Wastage is primarily due to preimplantation and early postimplantation mortality. In contrast to the decremental effects of aging on litter size, maternal behavior in virgin rats is enhanced at 19\u201320 months, when compared with those at 3\u20134 months of age (Gonzalez and Deis, 1990). In addition, at least some maternal stressors can lead to fetal wastage. An increase in fetal wastage was reported to be due to an earthquake that occurred when the dams were at 7, 8, or 9 days of gestation, although no difference was noted in the number of live births, fetal weight, or incidence of runts (Fujinaga et al., 1992). This raises the possibility of similar fetal loss when rats are shipped at this stage of gestation, although such has not been documented in the peer-reviewed literature. Strenuous maternal exercise, i.e., running on a treadmill\u2014has also been reported to result in decreased litter size and decreased fetal weight (Mottola et al., 1992). Dystocia is rare in rats. Cannibalism is not frequently encountered and is an indicator of maternal stress.",

            "text": "Rat pups are altricial and nidicolous; they are hairless and blind, with poorly developed limbs, short tails, and closed ear canals (Baker, 1979). There is an inverse relationship between fetal or birth weight and litter size (Romero et al., 1992). This phenomenon is significant for the reproductive toxicologist because the tendency of a test substance to cause decreased fetal weight may be masked if it also causes fetal loss. Other factors also influence birth weight and weaning weight, including the age of the dams. Pups of dams mated at 105 days of age weighed more at weaning than pups of dams mated at 35 or 70 days (Rosen et al., 1987). The external acoustic meati open between 2.5 and 3.5 days of age. Internally, the cochlea and organ of Corti are immature at birth but develop rapidly to approximately adult morphology by the time of weaning. Rats appear to first be able to hear at about 9 days of age, although they are able to vocalize from the time of birth (Feldman, 1992). Incisors erupt at 6\u20138 days of age, although molars do not erupt until 16 (molar 1), 18 (molar 2), and 32\u201334 days of age (molar 3) (Brown and Leininger, 1992). The retina is poorly developed at birth, equivalent to a human fetus of 4\u20135 months. The eyelids open at about 14\u201317 days of age, although the retina does not fully mature until 30\u201340 days of age, and the final components in the angle of the anterior chamber are not fully formed until 60 days of age (Weisse, 1992). Some hairs may be present on the trunk at birth, usually associated with touch domes, indicating that they are guard hairs (English and Munger, 1992). Pups are considered fully haired at about 7\u201310 days of age. Maternal antibody is transferred passively across the yolk sac in utero (Laliberte et al., 1984). Antibody can also be transferred across the intestinal mucosa from maternal colostrum and milk in the suckling rat. This transfer occurs at low rates shortly after birth, reaches maximal rates at day 14, and ceases by the 21 days, when gut closure is said to be complete (Martin et al., 1997).",

These glands may be surgically removed without compromising fertility rates from AI. Alternatively, sperm may also be collected by stripping directly from the epididymis, although probably not more than twice from each male rat. Sperm from the proximal portion of the cauda epididymidis are reported to have greater fertility than sperm for the middle or caudal portions (Moore and Akhondi, 1996). Once collected, sperm may be surgically introduced directly into the uterus of estrous females (Orihuela et al., 1999). An essential step in assuring the success of AI is the induction of pseudopregnancy in the recipient female by prior mating with a vasectomized male, by mechanical stimulation of the vagina, or by electrical stimulation of the cervix (Bennett and Vickery, 1970; Rouleau et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Embryo transfer in rats is becoming more widely used as an alternative to cesarean rederivation in order to eliminate pathogens from breeding lines. Embryo transfer can also be used to investigate whether specific characteristics are due to, or modified by, the uterine environment, in contrast to being solely determined by genetic factors (Kubisch and Gomez-Sanchez, 1999; Rouleau et al., 1993). Additionally, embryo collection is the first step in cryopreservation. In embryo transfer, embryos are collected 2\u20134 days after the females are bred. Embryos are usually washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), with or without added trypsin. Trypsin may more effectively remove pathogens than PBS alone. Embryos are then suspended in PBS with BSA and fetal calf serum and surgically transferred into the uterus or oviduct of the pseudopregnant recipient (Kubisch and Gomez-Sanchez, 1999; Rouleau et al., 1993). Nonsurgical implantation of embryos through the cervix, using an otoscope, has also been reported (Bennett and Vickery, 1970) but has not found wide use. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is performed in the rat but is used primarily as a research tool for events in fertilization and early development rather than as a colony management tool (Gaddum-Rosse et al., 1984; Vanderhyden et al., 1986). One form of IVF, the microinjection of spermatids into individual oocytes, is, however, used in mice to rescue or maintain strains that do not produce motile spermatozoa (Tanemura et al., 1997; Songsasen and Leibo, 1998). The same techniques will probably become more common in rats.",

Cryopreservation can be an efficient method of maintaining the potential of raising live mice of the thousands of genetically modified genotypes currently available (Songsasen and Leibo, 1998). It can serve as a fail-safe measure, should a strain become genetically contaminated. In addition to being used for murine reproductive purposes, frozen embryos are also used to test culture reagents and environments for human IVF (Meyer et al., 1997). Although embryos, two-cell through morula, are most frequently cryopreserved, the techniques for cryopreservation of mouse sperm have recently been developed (Songsasen and Leibo, 1998; Tanemura et al., 1997). Cryopreservation of sperm has not yet been reported for rats.",

Although this unfortunate, perhaps unavoidable, lack may lead some readers to conclude that rat behavior is not an important aspect of laboratory animal science, quite the contrary is actually true. Many aspects of the rat's normal behavior may affect scientific use of rats in biomedical research and should be investigated by researchers prior to initiating studies in those specific areas. Aspects of rat behavior relevant to experimental design and disease status may be considered in two broad and overlapping categories: normal behavior, and stressors and stress responses. Only a few examples will be cited here.",

Sprague-Dawley rats, such as the CD and SD, and Lewis rats are generally more docile than Brown Norway or F-344 rats. Frequent gentle handling will increase docility, whereas infrequent or rough handling will evoke fear responses. Gentle handling not only reduces the likelihood of occupational injury for animal workers but also avoids stress for the rats. Handling-induced stress can lead to altered responses in behavioral studies (Hirsjarvi and Valiaho, 1995; Shalev et al., 1998). Handling also leads to vocalization, much of which is ultrasonic, in the range of 22 kHz (Brudzynski et al., 1993; Brudzynski and Chiu, 1995; Brudzynski and Ociepa, 1992). Stress-induced vocalization can make handling more difficult for other rats within hearing range. An additional interesting fact regarding rat vocalization, illustrative of its importance in rat behavior, is that rat pups vocalize in the ultrasonic range, probably to signal their mothers, even before their ears are sufficiently developed for them to be capable of hearing (Feldman, 1992).",

Because false-positive reactions can occur (Hook et al., 1998), any positive results should be confirmed by a Steiner stain of tracheal mucosal scraping or histopathology with use of special stains, or by PCR. Interestingly, because infection is not readily transmitted by soiled bedding (Cundiff et al., 1995b), many sentinel programs may fail to detect CAR bacillus infection. Infection is lifelong, and the organisms are readily retrievable by tracheal lavage or scraping (Medina et al., 1998). Therefore, CAR bacillus may be readily detected by PCR (Cundiff et al., 1994), which may serve as an important confirmatory test to follow positive serologic results. PCR may be positive prior to serologic conversion, and samples for PCR may be collected as nasal swabs as a nonterminal procedure (Franklin et al., 1999).",

In addition to these two coronavirus strains, there are others that have been isolated and found to differ antigenically from either RCV-P or RCV-SDA. Historically, RCV-P and RCV-SDA were considered to induce two rather distinct sets of clinical signs and types of lesions in rats (Jacoby et al., 1979). More recently, however, the clinical signs, pathogenicity, and histological lesions are considered to be variable but similar for both RCV-P and RCV-SDA, and defining the neutralization group of a new RCV isolate is not useful in predicting its pathogenic potential (Compton et al., 1999). Accordingly, infection with either RCV-SDA or RCV-P cannot be differentiated by comparison of clinical signs or lesions. The antigenic differences between RCV-P and RCV-SDA are significant enough to allow cross-infection with either virus. Probably the most important point to be made from a clinical perspective is that neutralizing antibodies to one virus prototype will not offer significant cross protection from the other virus strain, thus allowing viral shedding and recurrence of clinical signs and lesions, albeit diminished (Percy and Barthold, 1993b; Jacoby, 1986; Bihun and Percy, 1994; Kojima and Okaniwa, 1991; Weir et al., 1990).",

Control of infection within a colony or facility is based upon the fact that rats shed the virus for only about 1 week, after which they are immune and not latently infected. The virus is not transmitted vertically. Eliminating rat coronavirus from a colony is achieved by allowing the virus to spread quickly to all animals, preventing entry of susceptible rats to the room, and suspension of breeding and removal of preweanlings. The rapidity in which all animals will seroconvert and no longer shed the virus will determine the period of time needed before susceptible animals can be safely introduced or breeding resumed. In most instances, a 6- to 8-week period should be allowed (Jacoby et al., 1979). Alternatively, if suspension of breeding cannot be done, a method to continue breeding and eliminate SDA is to define a subset of the breeding colony that is seropositive and to relocate these breeding animals to a separate room, allow litters to be born in the original colony until the relocated breeders are in late gestation, and then kill all animals in the original colony (Brammer et al., 1993).",

RV-contaminated bedding, stored at room temperature for up to 5 weeks, is capable of inducing seroconversion of rats for up to 5 weeks (Yang et al., 1995). Rats may harbor and transmit RV long after seroconversion occurs, with the frequency of persistent infection during natural outbreaks being RV strain-dependent (Gaertner et al., 1996). After experimental inoculation of RV into neonatal rats, the virus persists in tissues for up to 14 weeks, and the duration of infectivity to cage contacts up to 10 weeks. If weanling rats are inoculated, the duration of viral recovery and infectivity is decreased to 7 and 3 weeks, respectively (Paturzo et al., 1987; Jacoby et al., 1988). In another study, RV was recoverable for up to 6 months from tissue explant cultures derived from newborn rats (Jacoby et al., 1991). In persistent infections, DNA and antigenic evidence of RV is most likely to be observed in lymphoid tissues, endothelium, vascular muscle tunics, and renal tubular epithelium (Gaertner et al., 1996; Jacoby et al., 1991).",

Affected infant rats excreted feces that varied from liquid to being poorly formed, and the animals displayed erythema and bleeding of the perianal skin. Pathology associated with infection included small intestinal villous atrophy, villous epithelial necrosis, and syncytial cell formation. This same agent was found to be associated with diarrhea in humans and has been shown by enzyme immunoassay inhibition assay to be prevalent in children and adults. Human isolates were shown to induce diarrhea in infant rats (Eiden et al., 1985; Vonderfecht et al., 1985).

Giardia muris colonizes a wide variety of mammalian hosts, including rats, mice, hamsters, and humans (Levine, 1961). Recent evidence has suggested that G. muris may actually be a form of G. duodenalis (Sharma and Mayrhofer, 1988b). Although this conclusion seems to have implications for zoonotic potential, because G. duodenalis is a human pathogen, there does appear to be some host specificity, albeit incomplete. Giardia muris isolated from mice and hamsters, for example, did not produce infection when inoculated into rats (Kunstyr et al., 1992). Trophozoites were previously reported to attach to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells by means of a flat suction disk (Levine, 1985a). It is now thought that attachment is via a surface membrane mannose-binding lectin and can occur via any point on the parasite surface, without requiring the disk (Inge et al., 1988).

Most larvae lodge in tissues other than the kidneys and may cause hemorrhages or granulomas. Only those that reach the kidney or bladder survive and develop to maturity. The entire life cycle is 8\u20139 weeks, so eggs are not present in the urine until the rats are 8\u201312 weeks of age.",

The eggs have a distinct operculum, with a row of pores near the operculated end. The eggs hatch by a pneumatic mechanism in 5\u20136 days; the larvae ingest air through the pores, pass it through the body, and then use that pressure to force open the operculum (Owen, 1992b). The young nymphs are paler than the yellow-brown adults but are morphologically similar. After three ecdyses, or molts, they become adults. Depending on environmental conditions, the ecdyses require 1\u20133 weeks. The entire life cycle is completed in 2\u20135 weeks. Adults live only 25\u201328 days.

This agent is latently present in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats and humans, causing pneumonitis in hosts that are severely immunosuppressed. The immunocompromised rat is commonly used as a model of P. carinii pneumonitis that occurs in AIDS patients (Oz and Hughes, 1996). The agent is naturally acquired by rats through airborne transmission (Hughes, 1982) and is commonly present latently in rats from both conventional and barrier-maintained commercial sources. Diagnosis of infection in immunocompetent rats usually requires at least 6 weeks of treatment with a corticosteroid or cyclophosphamide to elicit a histologically detectable level of infection. Special stains such as methenamine silver demonstrate the fungal cysts within the alveoli. More recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to detect P. carinii infection in rat lungs consistently after only 1 week of treatment with corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide (Feldman et al., 1996). Pneumocystis carinii has a life cycle consisting of four morphologically distinct stages: trophozoite (1.5\u20132 \u03bcm), precyst (2\u20134 \u03bcm), cyst (5\u20137 \u03bcm), and sporozoites (1\u20131.7 \u03bcm) that develop within cysts (National Research Council, 1991a). Histopathology may vary from multifocal alveolar aggregates of cysts with interstitial and perivascular infiltrates in less severe cases to pulmonary consolidation with foamy, eosinophilic, honeycombed alveolar exudation and severe interstitial fibrosis (GV-SOLAS, 1999). Control of the disease in immunocompromised rats can be achieved by treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",

Only a few of the most common will be mentioned. Sanitation of the animal's cage, bedding, water, and feed, as well as of experimental equipment, is critical. High moisture content in bedding leads to rapid growth of bacteria, which can increase the incidence of urinary tract infections and, possibly, mastitis and skin lesions. Some softwood bedding materials emit aromatic compounds that may increase hepatic microsomal levels, although these compounds are usually completely sublimated during the drying phase in bedding manufacture. Some organisms are airborne and can enter or spread within a facility via air currents. Considerations of air quality might also include factors such as ammonia, other bedding gases, dusts, fungal spores, disinfectant vapors, and pollutants. Management consideration must be given to organisms carried by human caretakers and investigators. Humans are commonly colonized by, and can transmit, Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Campylobacter spp., and so on. In addition, humans can transmit viruses that may result in serologic cross-reactions, if not outright infection, and can also serve as fomites for many other organisms.",

Low humidity, considered to be relative humidity of less than 40%, together with high temperature, has been linked to the poorly characterized condition known as ringtail. Unfortunately, experimental reproduction of ringtail has not been reported, nor has the pathogenesis of the condition been elucidated. Ringtail is primarily a condition of young rats, usually sucklings, characterized by the formation of prominent annular constrictions of the tail and occasionally of the digits. Portions of affected extremities distal to the constrictions often become necrotic and are sloughed. This condition should not be confused with bite wounds or the normal, more subtle annulations of rat tails which develop with age.",

Therefore, low audible noise levels for humans do not indicate that noise levels are acceptable to rats. Rats, especially albino rats are susceptible to retinal degeneration when exposed to ambient light levels above a threshold of between 130 and 270 lux (Semple-Rowland and Dawson, 1987). As a result, recommended room light levels are 325\u2013400 lux (National Research Council, 1996b). Note that these recommended levels are as measured 1 m above the floor and do not necessarily reflect actual light levels to which rats are exposed in individual cages at various levels in racks at varying distances from light fixtures. Exposure to very high light levels of 1600 lux for 12 hours each day for 8 days resulted in necrosis in Harderian glands (Kurisu et al., 1996). In addition, exposure to constant light may cause anestrus and other breeding problems as described in Section II,D,3. Exposure (contamination) during the dark phase of the light cycle, with light levels as low as 0.21 lux, has been reported to interfere with growth and metabolism of tumors (Dauchy et al., 1997).",

Occasionally, wire-grid floors will allow a rat's foot to become entrapped in the wire grid causing severe edema and injury to the foot and leg. One of the authors (DK) has observed this most often when rats are allowed to recover from anesthesia in a wire-bottom cage. Group housing of rats is much less likely to result in traumatic injuries due to fighting than is seen in mice. Ulcerative dermatitis, associated with Staphylococcus aureus and self-induced trauma from scratching, has been reported (Fox et al., 1977; Wagner, 1977). In one report (Fox et al., 1977), the skin lesions were observed only in rats originating from two breeding colonies of one commercial vendor, leading to the hypothesis that the lesions may have been associated with specific Staphylococcus phage types or host susceptibility factors.",

On gross examination, fibroadenomas are freely movable in subcutaneous tissues, circumscribed, firm, and lobulated.

            "text": "Chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) is the most important age-related disease of rat kidneys and is among the most common causes of death in rats in lifetime studies. Synonyms abound, including chronic progressive nephrosis and old rat nephropathy. The condition is more common in males than in females and is progressive, as correctly indicated by its appellation. Gross lesions of CPN are first observed in rats more than 6 months of age and are characterized by pitting of the cortical surface. Because of cortical interstitial fibrosis, removal of the renal capsule may tear the cortical parenchyma. As it becomes more severe in rats more than 1 year of age, the cortical surface becomes increasingly irregular and may develop areas of pallor. Microscopically, glomerular changes are characterized by thickened basement membranes, thickening of the capillary tufts, adhesions to the parietal layer of Bowman's membrane, and segmental glomerulosclerosis (Short and Goldstein, 1992). As the disease advances, numerous tubules in both the cortex and medulla are often dilated and filled with eosinophilic proteinaceous casts. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may occur subsequent to renal functional compromise in advanced cases, resulting in widespread dystrophic mineralization. The etiopathogenesis of CPN is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. However, several of the major contributing factors have been described (Barthold, 1996b; Percy and Barthold, 1993b). First, the reported incidence varies with strain. This indicates probably at least some genetic predisposition for the development of CPN. Sprague-Dawley and F-344 rats have high incidences, whereas Wistar and Long-Evans stocks have a lower incidence. Reported incidences, however, are difficult Ito interpret, because of geographic variation in use of different stocks and strains (Wistar rats have been used more predominantly in Europe, and Sprague-Dawley rats in the United States), which could lead to other factors, such as housing and diet, actually causing what otherwise appears to be a strain-related change. For example, when many of the reports of the incidence of CPN in European rats were published, rats were housed 5 per cage, which is known to result in decreased feed consumption and decreased weight gain, relative to single housing. Second, gender is a determining factor in the development of CPN. Male rats have an earlier onset, higher incidence at any given age, and greater severity of lesions than do females. Third, diet is a critical factor and is also the factor that may be the most amenable to management solutions. It is now clear that moderate dietary restriction will greatly reduce the incidence and severity of CPN at any given age, relative to ad libitum overfeeding. The mechanism is hypothesized to be that overfeeding results in prolonged increases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (Gumprecht et al., 1993). These increases cause glomerular hypertrophy, leading to macromolecule filtration deficits, mesangial damage, glomerulosclerosis, and protein leakage. Whatever the mechanism, however, 25\u201330% reduction in caloric intake, relative to ad libitum, results in decreased incidence and severity of CPN in female rats, and decreased severity of CPN in male rats, as well as increased survival in both sexes (Keenan et al., 1995a).",

            "text": "Nephrocalcinosis is defined as the deposition of calcium phosphate in renal tissue, although a variety of additional terms are sometimes employed to reflect the localization of the mineral in the cortex, medulla, and so on. In contrast to CPN, which is more common in males, nephrocalcinosis is more common in female rats. In addition to gender, the incidence varies with age and strain and may occur in F-344 rats as young as 7 weeks old. The incidence in F-344 rats may reach 50%, whereas the lower incidence of 0\u20137% is reported in stocks of Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats (Montgomery and Seely, 1990). An especially high incidence is observed in BDIX rats. The incidence and severity of nephrocalcinosis may be increased by several dietary manipulations, including high levels of calcium, high phosphorus, low calcium/phosphorus ratios, or low magnesium (Percy and Barthold, 1993b). However, it is not clear if dietary levels of these minerals are a key determining factor in the background incidence of nephrocalcinosis. Histologically (Short and Goldstein, 1992), mineral deposition is observed most frequently at the corticomedullary junction, in cells of the pars recta and thin loops of Henle, as well as in the lumen of these tubules.",

The condition is often known as cardiomyopathy, or chronic progressive cardiomyopathy, and may be observed as early as 3 months of age. Grossly, the heart is enlarged, occasionally with pale streaks visible. Increased weight of the heart correlates well with the degree of damage observed on histologic examination. Microscopically (Lewis, 1992), there is necrosis of myocardial fibers and an interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells. Later in the course of the disease, fibrosis may be more prominent. Large reactive nuclei are also observed in myofibers. The most commonly affected myocardial sites are the papillary muscles and interventricular septum. As with chronic progressive nephropathy, the incidence of chronic progressive cardiomyopathy can be dramatically reduced at any age by moderate dietary restriction, i.e., reduction of 25\u201330% of total caloric intake relative to ad libitum overfed rats (Keenan et al., 1995b).",

The most common change is thinning or loss of hair, especially over the back (Elwell et al., 1990). This may be observed in any stock or strain but is especially common in the Brown Norway rat. Old albino rats also have a more yellow appearance at times, because of the accumulation of sebum in the skin. The rings of scales covering the tail increase in number with age to 190 at 1 year (English and Munger, 1992). They continue to become more prominent and more yellowed with time after that. The yellowish material which accumulates on the tail and adjacent to the ear also may become black with time, probably from oxidation and/or bacterial action. In addition, male rats accumulate brown-pigmented foci on the skin, termed scales (Tayama and Shisa, 1994). These scales can be detached and can overlay skin of \u201cnormal\u201d color. They are found on the dorsum, with some on the tail and perineum. Scale formation is abrogated by gonadectomy. The nature of the pigment is unclear, but it may be oxidized lipid or amino acids.",

Grossly, alveolar histiocytosis is visible as white to pale tan foci, usually about 1 mm in diameter, visible on the pleural surface. The foci may extend slightly above the pleural surface in uninflated lung. Microscopically (Boorman and Eustis, 1990), clusters of alveoli, often in a subpleural locations or adjacent to a terminal bronchiole, contain increased numbers of large, pale, foamy-appearing macrophages. Occasionally, cholesterol clefts may be visible in the more dense aggregates of macrophages, and a slight infiltration of lymphocytes may be present around adjacent vessels, probably as a response to proinflammatory mediators released by the macrophages. Alveolar histiocytosis should not be mistaken for any of the viral pneumonias of rats, because affected animals are seronegative, and any lymphoid infiltrate is slight and localized to the areas of macrophage aggregation. The cause of alveolar histiocytosis is not known, but it does not appear to be infectious.",
