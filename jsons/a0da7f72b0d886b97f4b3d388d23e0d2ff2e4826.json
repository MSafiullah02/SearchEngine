In this study, we undertook a farm survey in Finland employing a choice experiment to study the willingness to pay for animal disease insurance products. We found that producers' willingness to pay for animal disease insurance is relatively low, even if consequential losses are covered. However, attributes of the insurance products which increased the likelihood of the producer wishing to purchase the product in a statistically significant manner were identified. The most important attribute was a low deductible. Using latent class analysis, four classes of producers were identified, those who were (1) not interested, (2) weakly interested or (3) strongly interested in insurance, and additionally, (4) a group who emphasised biosecurity measures but was not willing to purchase insurance. Those primarily interested in insurance were typically young, well-educated producers from large farms, and they already had a good level of biosecurity on their farms. However, the majority of the respondents preferred not to purchase insurance.

The negative and highly significant coefficients of compensated damages suggest that regardless of the attribute levels, many respondents preferred to choose the no buy option, i.e. not to purchase insurance. The coefficients indicated that the respondents on average preferred more compensation to less compensation (compensated damages 'high' had a less negative coefficient than compensated damages 'medium', which in turn was less negative than compensated damages 'low'). However, the difference in magnitude between the medium and high levels of compensated damages is fairly small, indicating that increasing the coverage of compensated damages increased purchase intentions only very little, if at all. Also, the price and the deductible were statistically significant attributes, the deductible being the second most important variable. The price had the expected negative sign: as the price increases, demand for insurance decreases. The price coefficients for different production lines are all negative and highly significant, but of different magnitudes, reflecting different values of the animal place as well as potentially different choice behaviour of the respondents in each line of production.

This information was obtained in the questionnaire, by asking how much the farms currently pay annually for animal disease insurance.

Based on farm accountancy data, the animal disease insurance payments were 619 euro for the pig farms and 668 euro for the poultry farms in 2009. These figures are in the same ballpark as the estimated WTPs indicating that on top of the existing schemes, not much additional WTP exists. In this paper, we have analysed demand for animal disease insurance in pigs and poultry in Finland. Our results suggest that overall, there is currently limited demand for a new animal disease insurance as a commercial product. This concerns a product which could be brought to the market to complement currently existing insurance and public compensation policies. Although WTP for such insurance products is low, in some cases even negative, it also varies by market segment, and there are important product attributes that increase the likelihood of the producer wishing to purchase insurance policy. The attributes include, perhaps most importantly, a low deductible. This result combined with 30 % deductible required for a public insurance intervention (in connection to the CAP) 1 to be introduced to the markets reveals the possibilities for parallel existence of private and public insurance. Public intervention does not crowd out all (shallow loss type) private market insurances for animal diseases.

A similar result has been found by van Asseldonk et al. (2005) and Nganje et al. (2004) . In flood insurance, Botzen and van den Bergh (2012) found that lowering the coverage from 100 to 75 % reduced the WTP by only about 10 %.

Because of these policies and other reasons, the remaining risks are so small that producers' incentives to participate in an animal disease insurance against these diseases are compromised. Lower WTP for notifiable diseases suggests that most producers prefer not to purchase insurance and rather rely on public support or other means of managing the disease risk. Also, time preference of the producers might weaken the demand for diseases that have a low probability of occurrence.

The price was not as important a factor as anticipated. This result provokes reflection on whether the 1 Insurance support recently introduced by the CAP will be based on farmers' mutual funds. These are Article 37 'Crop, animal, and plant insurance', Article 38 BMutual funds for adverse climatic events, animal and plant diseases, pest infestations and environmental incidents^and Article 39 BIncome stabilisation tool^in (EU) No 1305/2013. Under these articles, support shall only be granted for insurance contracts (between producer and producers mutual fund) which cover for loss caused by an adverse climatic event, or by an animal or plant disease, or a pest infestation, or an environmental incident or a measure adopted in accordance with Directive 2000/29/EC to eradicate or contain a plant disease, or pest which destroys more than 30 % of the average annual production of the farmer in the preceding 3-year period or a 3-year average based on the preceding 5-year period, excluding the highest and lowest entry. respondents were overwhelmed by all the attributes, whether they had too many and too complicated options to address, or whether the impact of the price was overshadowed by the other attributes. In addition, the producers may have perceived difficulties in attaching a price to animal disease insurance as it is not widely available in the markets. Where found positive, WTPs were relatively similar compared to the insurance fees that the farms currently pay (on average about 630 euro per farm per year). Latent class analysis suggests that the type of supplier of the insurance does not play any significant role in determining the demand for animal disease insurance, although there are minor signs that a private insurance company may be somewhat preferred over producers' mutual fund. The lessons learned from EU member states show that a mutual fund covering animal disease expenses is the most commonly used form for cost sharing of direct costs in the Netherlands (Van Asseldonk et al. 2005; Meuwissen et al. 2003; OECD 2012) , Germany (OECD 2012; British Embassy Berlin 2002) and France (Cassagne 2002) . Within the CAP, mutual funds could be reported only if dealing with risks beyond farmers 30 % deductible. Hence, there seems to be room for marketorientated coordination on animal disease insurance. Private companies handle shallow losses which is the area where CAP-supported mutual funds are not allowed to operate.

Farm insurance products in Finland are often sold as packages such that one product is purchased on top of another. Some of these packages may cover animal disease losses as well.
