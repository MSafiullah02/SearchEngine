            "text": "Graph embedding methods are useful for a wide range of graph analysis tasks including link prediction and node classification. Most graph embedding methods learn only the topological structure of graphs. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the incorporation of node attributes is beneficial in improving the expressive power of node embeddings. However, real-world graphs are often noisy in terms of structure and/or attributes (missing and/or erroneous edges/attributes). Most existing graph embedding methods are susceptible to this noise, as they do not consider uncertainty during the modelling process. In this paper, we introduce RASE, a Robust Attribute and Structure preserving graph Embedding model. RASE is a novel graph representation learning model which effectively preserves both graph structure and node attributes through a unified loss function. To be robust, RASE uses a denoising attribute auto-encoder to deal with node attribute noise, and models uncertainty in the embedding space as Gaussians to cope with graph structure noise. We evaluate the performance of RASE through an extensive experimental study on various real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that RASE outperforms state-of-the-art embedding methods on multiple graph analysis tasks and is robust to both structure and attribute noise.",

Also, much attribute information is abstracted from free text (e.g. users' post on social media) and is usually imprecise or ambiguous due to the limitations in data sources or abstraction tools.

Recently, several studies have been proposed to model the uncertainty present in graph data [1, 8, 11, 20] . Most of these work, including VGAE [11] , and Graph2Gauss [1] , focuses on modelling the uncertainty of the node embeddings by representing the nodes with a probabilistic distribution in the embedding space. Since these studies attempts to preserve the observable graph structural proximity by measuring the distance between probability distribution embeddings, uncertainty modelling of these methods can only capture structure noise. Therefore, they do not explicitly account for the node attribute noise which is common in the real-world graphs.",

Structure noise is modelled in the latent layer by modelling the embeddings as Gaussian distributions. To preserve the transitivity in the embedding space with a linear computational cost, 2-Wasserstein distance is used as the similarity measure between the distributions in Gaussian space. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five different real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating effective embeddings for node classification and link prediction.

TADW [19] incorporates text attributes and graph structure with low-rank matrix factorization. GraphSAGE [7] is a CNN-based technique that samples and aggregates neighbouring node attributes. Graph2Gauss [1] finds the neighbours in each hop up to a pre-defined number of hops which is space inefficient. Also, it uses node attributes for embedding initialization and does not explicitly preserve attributes when learning embeddings. VGAE [11] is a graph convolution network (GCN) method, which aggregates neighbouring attributes. In most studies, node attributes are only used for embedding initialization, but not during model training. DANE [4] proposes a deep non-linear architecture to preserve both aspects.",

To deal with attribute noise, RASE corrupts node attributes by introducing a random noise \u03b5 i sampled from a binomial distribution, which are then projected to a low-dimensional representation u i . RASE takes this u i as input and simultaneously performs node attribute learning and graph structure learning. By reconstructing the node attributes from u i , the model preserves attributes (with Euclidean distance to preserve transitivity) while being robust to attribute noise.

A Gaussian noise would substantially change a sparse attribute vector and would not characterise the trends observed in the real data. Thus, we draw noise from a binomial distribution as a masking noise but it still depicts the original data trends. Accordingly, we inject some impurity to the original node attribute vector x i \u2208 R D by sampling a random binary noise vector \u03b5 i \u2208 {0, 1} D from a binomial distribution B with D (i.e. attribute vector dimension) trials and p success probability.

Furthermore, in all five datasets, RASE has demonstrated a larger improvement margin to the baselines when only smaller numbers of nodes are used for training, e.g., a 174.9% improvement over best performing baseline in Flickr at 1% labeled nodes. This performance improvement is due to the attribute preserving component, which learns meaningful latent representations from node attributes. Moreover, denoising the attributes in this process also helps our model to deal with scarce data which is common in the real-world graphs. Also, our proposed structure learning method has captured useful local and global node similarities (due to the transitivity-preserving property in W 2 metric). Overall, RASE(\u00acR) manifests superiority among the non-probabilistic methods (i.e. node2vec, LINE and GraphSAGE) consistently outperforming them in all datasets. Interestingly, on BlogCatalog, Flickr and Cora, RASE(\u00acR) also substantially outperforms the probabilistic models DVNE, VGAE and G2G.

We vary the percentage of noisy edges added to the graph from 0%-50%, and observe AUC and AP decline with the increasing noise in link prediction task. The results are presented in Table 3 . From Table 3 , we see that RASE performs the best in all the structural noise percentages, showing that it is robust to noisy graph structures. In addition to this, with the increase in noise ratio from 0% to 50%, RASE's AUC degradation is only 3.8%. Also, RASE outperforms its non-robust version, RASE(\u00acR), which shows that the proposed uncertainty modelling technique to mitigate structure noise is effective. In contrast, though DVNE, VGAE and G2G also model uncertainty in the embeddings, their performance degradation is quite significant (7.4%, 6.5% and 14.3% in AUC respectively) when the noise ratio is increased from 0% to 50%. VGAE is based on GCN, which aggregates the neighbouring attributes into a convex embedding. Thus, it is heavily affected by noisy neighbours, as errors get further exaggerated. The hop-based structural ranking in G2G is sensitive to false neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the square-exponential loss function used for pair-wise ranking in both G2G and DVNE does not have a fixed margin and pushes the distance of the negative edges to infinity with an exponentially decreasing force [1] . Hence, these methods are highly sensitive to erroneous and missing edges. In contrast, RASE is mildly affected due to its carefully designed structural loss function and the extra information learned from the neighbourhood via the transitivity property of W 2 metric. Attribute Noise: To evaluate the robustness of the methods to random attribute noise, we corrupt the node attribute vectors randomly. Then, we assess node classification performance of the learned embeddings on these corrupted graphs. Specifically, we sample a masking noise from a binomial distribution with D (i.e. attribute dimension) trials and p = 0.70 probability, and perform Hadamard product with attribute vectors of some randomly selected nodes.",

Table 4 shows that RASE is robust to random node attribute noise, having the highest macro-and micro-F1 scores steadily across all noisy node percentages. Moreover, RASE only shows a 3.3% degradation in micro-F1, when we increase the proportion of corrupted nodes from 0% to 50%. The small degradation can be attributed to the node attribute denoising step. RASE also outperforms its non-robust counterpart, showing the effectiveness of attribute noise modelling component. GraphSAGE shows a poorer node classification performance when compared to others, which shows that noisy attributes has misled the model to learn inexact node embeddings. Negative effect of noisy attributes of neighbouring nodes in GCN's aggregation step causes the lower performance of VGAE when its performance is compared against RASE and G2G. Overall, G2G shows a modest micro-F1 decline (i.e. 4.9% from 0% to 50%), since the Gaussian node embeddings have captured the attribute uncertainty via the variance terms.",
