The prevalence of AKI has been increasing by up to 50% in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [3\u20135]. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a widely used renal replacement modality, particularly when patients have severe AKI and are unstable, because it can easily control biochemical imbalances caused by AKI [6, 7]. Despite the benefits of this modality, the mortality rate remains high, ranging from 30 to 70% [8\u201310]. Considering the critical condition of patients who undergo CRRT, the precise prediction of their prognosis is a topic of interest.",

Machine learning also appears to be useful in predicting outcomes of critically ill patients or patients with AKI [18\u201321]. However, machine learning algorithms have not been applied to patients undergoing CRRT for AKI. Conventional scoring models such as APACHE II and SOFA show limitations, for example, a low prediction accuracy for the CRRT subset and difficulty of adding new variables to the models. Our new abbreviated mortality scoring system for AKI with CRRT (MOSAIC model) has not been validated in other cohorts despite a high prediction accuracy of mortality for the CRRT subset [22]. Because of the success of machine learning in other clinical applications, the study explored whether machine learning algorithms are also applicable for predicting the mortality of patients initiating CRRT for AKI. The study compared the performance of several machine learning models with that of the conventional APACHE II and SOFA scores, and with the MOSAIC model.",

The laboratory data such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, pH, sodium, and potassium were measured at the time of starting CRRT. APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC scores were calculated based on the calculation methods presented in the original studies [13, 14, 22].

Categorical and continuous variables are expressed as proportions and the means \u00b1 standard deviation, respectively. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables (Fisher\u2019s exact test if not applicable). The Student\u2019s t test was used to compare continuous variables. Several machine learning algorithms were used, such as \u03ba-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boost (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN). The KNN modeling was performed using a hyperparameter selection process (\u03ba) involving leave-one-out cross-validation to determine the best accuracy for the training set. The Euclidean distance was used to train the KNN model. The rectangular, triangular, Epanechnikov, biweight, Gaussian, rank, and optimal kernels were used in training. We developed the SVM models using various kernels including linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis functions. For each kernel, we conducted 10-fold cross-validation and selected the best hyperparameter (cost, gamma, degree, and coefficients). We selected the kernel corresponding to the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the final SVM model. We conducted 10-fold cross-validation to develop the MARS model on the training set. The maximum degree of interaction and the MiniSpan were set to three, indicating the allowance of three evenly spaced knots for each predictor. To select the hyperparameter for the RF model, we used 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. The hyperparameter included ntree (number of trees), mtry (number of variables used in each tree), and nodesize (minimum size of nodes, which determines depth). We used 10-fold cross-validation to develop the XGB model and determined the best hyperparameter consisting of eta (step size shrinkage used in the update process to prevent overfitting), gamma (minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition), and the maximum depth of a tree. We used 10-fold cross-validation to construct the ANN model and determined the optimal hyperparameter consisting of the size (the number of hidden nodes) and decay (parameter for weight decay). When developing the KNN, SVM, and ANN models, we standardized all of the prediction variables except for the categorical variables for analysis. Herein, categorical variables were processed using one-hot encoding. Once we developed the models using the training set, we calculated the F1 score, accuracy, and AUCs on the test set to measure the performance of each model. To calculate the accuracy and F1 score of the APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC results, we used the best threshold point of the receiver operating characteristic curve to determine the probability of mortality. The AUCs of the models were compared using the DeLong test. The net benefit of the machine learning model was assessed by using decision curve analysis [23, 24]. In the decision curve analysis, APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC scores were converted to a logistic regression using probability theory. Calibration, which is the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies of ICU mortality, was assessed with calibration belts. All P values were two-sided, and values less than 0.05 were considered significant.",

The RF model demonstrated superior performance to the APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC methods (Ps <  0.05) (Fig. 1a). The better performance of the RF model than the conventional scoring systems remained consistent, even if the ICU mortality was considered without censoring the discontinuation of CRRT (Additional file 2: Figure S1). The net benefit of the RF model ranged from 7 to 95%, which was better than the ranges corresponding to the APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC scores (Fig. 1b, without 95% confidence intervals [CIs]; Additional file 2: Figure S2, with 95% CIs). The machine learning models achieved better performance than the conventional scoring systems (Table 2). All of the machine learning models achieved higher F1 scores and accuracy than conventional scoring systems. The receiver operating characteristic curves of all of the evaluated models are shown in Additional file 2: Figure S3.\n\n",

The APACHE II and SOFA scores are representative of these methods and have demonstrated accurate prediction of mortality in this patient subset [13, 14, 25\u201328]. However, these approaches showed poor performance for critically ill patients with AKI [11, 12]. Two other scoring models have been applied to critically ill patients with AKI. The HELENICC score, which focused on patients with septic AKI, used five variables (norepinephrine utilization, liver failure, medical condition, and lactate and pre-dialysis creatinine levels) and demonstrated good performance in predicting 7-day mortality (AUC = 0.82) [12]. Another model, which focused on ICU-admitted patients with AKI, also showed good performance for predicting 7-day mortality (AUC = 0.85) [11]. However, these models did not focus on patients initiating CRRT for AKI. A few studies have identified risk factors of mortality in patients receiving CRRT [29, 30]. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a mortality prediction model because a few clinical variables may not be sufficient to precisely predict patient outcome. Recently, our MOSAIC model achieved suitable performance with respect to mortality prediction for patients receiving CRRT (AUC = 0.772), but the approach requires further validation and the addition of new variables may be difficult [22]. Machine learning algorithms may solve these problems and will have the added benefit of increased accuracy with the accumulation of data.",

Nevertheless, this issue does not infringe on the purpose of the study, which entails applying machine learning to predict the mortality of patients initiating CRRT for AKI, rather than developing the final generalized model for clinical use. Achieving acceptable performance with a supervised deep-learning algorithm requires more than 5000 data points [34], but the present dataset consisted of a modest sample size. However, the median sample size of the previous 258 studies which used machine learning to analyze ICU data was 488 [20], which is smaller than our sample size. The study identified the most important variables with respect to predicting mortality, but we could not obtain certain degrees of risk, such as the relative risk, which is a common limitation of machine learning algorithms. Concerns could be raised regarding other issues such as overfitting, absence of external validation, and not using fixed time points for the mortality endpoint.",
