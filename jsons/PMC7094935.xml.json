The 28-day mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe pneumonia in our center prior 2009 was as high as 50 % which was consistent with a literature report [2]. Accordingly, we have implemented an interdisciplinary approach for renal transplant recipients with severe pneumonia involving the intensivists and transplant surgeons since 2009 in order to improve the outcome of these patients.",
