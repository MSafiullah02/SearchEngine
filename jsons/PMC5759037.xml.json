In 2013, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group on Influenza Vaccines and Immunizations updated their general recommendations on A(H5N1) vaccines to include use before pandemics (i.e., inter-pandemic) and strongly recommended vaccination of laboratory personnel working with A(H5N1) viruses [7]. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Select Agents and Toxins made specific recommendations for vaccination with an A(H5N1) vaccine for all laboratory workers working with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinin from the influenza A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage [13]. However, without a licensed, available vaccine for use during the inter-pandemic period, access to A(H5N1) vaccine among laboratory personnel in the United States has been limited to participation in clinical trials.",

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) licensed two of these for use in the United States during a pandemic [17]. FDA licensed Q-Pan H5N1 in 2013 for use in persons aged \u226518 years at increased risk of occupational exposure to influenza A(H5N1) virus.

The vaccine was prepared under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the national pandemic preparedness initiative.

Analysis was limited to those respondents who reported working in the BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occur (and therefore could have been exposed to live virus or virus particles) with sub-analyses limited to those who worked directly with A(H5N1) viruses. Given that laboratory personnel may have varying work schedules in the BSL-3E area depending on occupational category and work (e.g., concentrated intermittent vs. regularly scheduled weekly hours), we asked respondents to estimate percentages of their total work time spent on various types of work with HPAI or A(H5N1) (<10%, 10\u201325%, 26\u201350%, 51\u201375% or >75%).

Q-Pan H5N1 was the first licensed influenza vaccine with adjuvant in the United States [26]. Adjuvants are used to increase the magnitude and breadth (e.g., production of cross-strain neutralizing antibodies) of the immune response to the vaccine, which is especially important for vaccines containing influenza strains for which little or no prior antibodies are present, such as novel influenza A viruses [27], [28], [29]. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, some AS03-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines were associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in some countries [30], [31], though it is unknown whether this was related to the antigen, the adjuvant, some genetic susceptibility, or a combination of these factors. The acceptable safety profile of Q-Pan H5N1 was demonstrated in several studies prior to licensure and is comparable with seasonal influenza vaccines, though larger sample sizes are needed to assess for rare adverse events such as narcolepsy [29], [32], [33]. Furthermore, the ASO3 adjuvant used in Q-Pan H5N1 has been shown to have a better immune response than the MF59 adjuvant when used in an A(H7N9) vaccine [34].",

In addition, our survey results may not be generalizable to other occupations with potential occupational exposure to HPAI viruses (e.g., avian influenza outbreak responders). We also had difficulties assessing accurately the time spent working with HPAI or A(H5N1) viruses. Estimates were based on respondents\u2019 reported typical work schedules, which may vary in time spent in the BSL-3E area working with HPAI. Individuals who work more with HPAI or influenza A(H5N1) viruses may have been more likely to respond to the survey introducing response bias. Finally, the survey was designed to collect information relevant for vaccination policy in the United States and distributed to laboratories registered with the USDA, so the results may not be generalizable to the broader global community.",
