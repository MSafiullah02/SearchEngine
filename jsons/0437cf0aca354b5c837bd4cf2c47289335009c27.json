Earlier research has recognized a significant and broad range of psychosocial effects on individuals, populations and globally during infection outbreaks. Individually, people are likely to be fearful of becoming ill or dying, feelings of helplessness and stigma (Hall, Hall, & Chapman, 2008) . During one outbreak of influenza, about 10 to 30 % of the general population is highly or extremely anxious about the risk of getting the virus (Rubin, Potts, & Michie, 2010) . With schools and businesses closed, the negative emotions felt by people are intensified (Van Bortel et al., 2016) . During the SARS epidemic, many studies examined the non-infected population's mental wellbeing, exposing major mental symptoms such as anxiety that were found to be correlated with younger age and growing self-blame (Sim, Chan, Chong, Chua, & Soon, 2010) .",

The questionnaire is intended to measure specific and/or generalized social phobia/anxiety in adults population ( \u2265 18 years) from general and clinical populations. This is very valuable for recognizing not only people with generalized social phobia but mainly specific social phobia (Caballo et al., 2010) . The SAQ-A30 comprises 30 items conforming a social phobia/anxiety structure of five very solid dimensions, each of them including six items. Data on the questionnaire's internal consistency, construct validity, cut-off scores, invariance, and factor structure have been presented (Caballo et al., 2010) . Internal consistency reliability was good for SAQ-A30 in this study (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.91).",

The results of this study indicated that the general public in Saudi Arabia reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to moderate. One potential explanation is that Saudi Arabia, as one of the countries of the Middle East, has its social systems, cultural norms and relationships that can vary from the norms of Western cultures. Families and friends in Saudi culture can be instrumental in alleviating tension and anxiety among the general public experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. According to Pew research center (PRC), the most of Saudi Arabia's people (93%) were Muslims (PRC, 2018) , the sample of this study may depend on the beliefs of individuals in God (Allah), that everything that occurs to a Muslim is by Allah and He alone saves us.

While the epidemic progresses, it is necessary to prepare healthcare professionals and the general public for medical and mental readiness if there is broad transmission in different regions of Saudi Arabia. Our results have both clinical and policy implications. First, health care administrators should classify high-risk groups as high levels of anxiety for early implementation of a mental health program based on socio-demographic information. Socio-demographic data in this study indicate a higher level of anxiety among married people than unmarried people. This result is in line with previous studies which were found married participants to have higher levels of anxiety than unmarried participants . The logical reason for that is the married people fear for their families and also fear for their children's academic status. The confusion and potential negative effects on academic advancement may have a negative effect on the students' mental health. Education During the outbreak, Saudi policymakers need to establish web-portals and web-based applications for classrooms or other teaching activities (Zhang, Ho, & Ho, 2014 .

Higher contentment with the health information earned was linked to lower levels of anxiety associated with the outbreak. To prevent adverse mental responses, the quality of health information received during the outbreak needs to be based upon evidence. Specific information on medications or vaccinations, transmission channels, and data on the number and location of infected cases (e.g., real-time, online interactive monitoring dashboard) have been linked with lower levels of anxiety. Third, the nature of mental therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), needs to be reviewed to address the general population's needs during the outbreak. To prevent the spread of infection, CBT should ideally be administered online or over the phone. Since online CBT does not require the presence of mental health professionals such as psychologists, this will assist the general public in Saudi Arabia, as psychologists are limited in number. Since the general population in Saudi Arabia was homebound by government regulations during the epidemic for at least 12 hours a day, behavioral therapy should concentrate on relaxation activities to alleviate anxiety and scheduling activity such as home-based exercise and entertainment to alleviate anxiety in the home setting.",

Given the limited resources available and the time-sensitivity of the COVID-19 epidemic, the researchers adopted the snowball sampling technique. Sampling technique of snowballing was not based on a random sample collection, and the population studied did not represent the present trend of the general population. Additionally, a prospective analysis on the same group of participants after a period would be appropriate. The researchers were not allowed to obtain contact details and personal data from the respondents because of ethical standards on anonymity and confidentiality. As a result, we could not perform a prospective analysis that would support the need for a focused public health program. Another limitation is that self-reported anxiety of levels may not always be associated with the mental health professionals' evaluation. This study's findings may be used as a historical reference point. More significantly, the results specifically advise the creation of mental support programs that can reduce anxiety during COVID-19 epidemic and provide a context for evaluating prevention, control, and treatment efforts during the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, which is still ongoing at the time of preparation of this study.",
