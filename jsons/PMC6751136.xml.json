The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 in the Guangdong province of China and spread across the globe, resulting in 8,000 infections and nearly 800 deaths in 37 countries. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian peninsula in 2012 and has caused numerous outbreaks in humans, with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV is of bat origin and crossed the species barrier using palm civets as putative intermediate hosts (Ge et al., 2013, Li et al., 2005b, Wang et al., 2005), whereas MERS-CoV is found in dromedary camels as a natural reservoir (Haagmans et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2013). Surveillance studies in bats detected numerous coronaviruses sharing high nucleotide sequence similarity with pathogenic human coronaviruses (Hu et al., 2017, Menachery et al., 2015, Menachery et al., 2016), suggesting that additional zoonotic transmission events are likely to occur in the future. Currently, no specific treatments or vaccines are available against any of the six human-infecting coronaviruses.",

We have previously determined structures of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S ectodomain in the pre-fusion and post-fusion states, which provided snapshots of the start and end points of the membrane fusion reaction (Walls et al., 2016a, Walls et al., 2017).

            "text": "Proteolytic processing and receptor-binding act in synergy to induce large-scale S conformational changes promoting coronavirus entry. Priming involves S cleavage by host proteases at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2), in a subset of coronaviruses, and at a conserved site upstream of the fusion peptide (S2\u2019) in all known coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2009, Burkard et al., 2014, Millet and Whittaker, 2014, Park et al., 2016). The latter site is believed to be the most important for membrane fusion activation. The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S receptor-binding domain, designated domain B, exhibits multiple conformational states that modulate the accessibility of the receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) and in turn the ability to interact with host cells. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that receptor binding may initiate membrane fusion (Gui et al., 2017, Pallesen et al., 2017, Yuan et al., 2017). However, the S glycoprotein of other coronaviruses adopt a closed domain B conformation, incompatible with receptor engagement, indicating that structural rearrangements prior to receptor binding are required for entry (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2017, Shang et al., 2018, Walls et al., 2016a, Walls et al., 2016b, Xiong et al., 2017). Due to this unusual mechanism of proteolytic activation and RBM conformational masking, our understanding of coronavirus membrane fusion activation remains limited.",

            "text": "Since the S glycoprotein densely decorates the viral surface and is a key player in pathogenesis, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of intense interest for vaccine design. We previously showed that coronavirus S glycoproteins are decorated with an extensive glycan shield comprising up to 100 N-linked oligosaccharides (Walls et al., 2016b, Xiong et al., 2017). Molecular-level information of the carbohydrates attached to the surface of highly pathogenic coronaviruses, however, is lacking. These glycans contribute to S stability during biogenesis, since inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin was reported to yield virions lacking S glycoproteins (Rossen et al., 1998) and likely participate in immune evasion via epitope masking (Du et al., 2016, Walls et al., 2016b, Xiong et al., 2017). Studies of the S glycoproteins of MERS-CoV and the bat-specific HKU4 coronavirus suggested that glycans also impact zoonosis by modulating cleavage-site accessibility to proteases for membrane-fusion activation (Yang et al., 2015). The outcome of the arms race between viral evolution mechanisms and the immune system of infected individuals can also lead to the elicitation of antibodies binding glycan-containing epitopes, such as in the case of HIV-1 (Scharf et al., 2015, Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) or Epstein-Barr virus (Snijder et al., 2018). These findings emphasize the necessity to obtain a detailed understanding of the carbohydrates covering coronavirus S glycoproteins to accelerate the development of subunit vaccines and therapeutics.",

To understand neutralization, we report here an analysis of the fine molecular structure of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycan shields and the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) study of these glycoproteins in complex with two potent human neutralizing antibodies. Although both antibodies block receptor interaction, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody acts by functionally mimicking receptor attachment and promoting S fusogenic conformational rearrangements through a ratcheting mechanism. We found that the dynamics of the receptor-binding domain alter the apparent binding affinity of coronavirus S trimers for their cognate receptors, a phenomenon that cannot be detected using isolated B domains.

We used the stabilized MERS-CoV S 2P and SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomains, which harbor a double proline substitution between the central helix and the heptad-repeat 1 motif to enhance the stability of the prefusion conformation (Pallesen et al., 2017). We determined that oligosaccharides account for a molecular weight of 121 kDa and 98 kDa for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S, respectively (\nFigures S1\nA and S1B), using multi-angle light scattering, refractometry, and UV spectrophotometry (Veesler et al., 2009). These results suggest that \u223c25% of the molecular weight of a S ectodomain corresponds to oligosaccharides, whereas 50% of the HIV-1 mosaic M Env molecular weight is accounted for by glycans (Nkolola et al., 2014). We detected N-linked glycosylations at 22 and 16 unique sites for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S protomers, respectively, using liquid chromatography coupled with electron transfer/high-energy collision dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Frese et al., 2013). The data revealed an extraordinary heterogeneity of carbohydrates decorating the two S trimers (Figures 1A and 1B and Tables S1 and S2). Individual sequons were linked to 21 unique glycans on average and up to 64 distinct oligosaccharides for the most heterogeneous sites. The intact glycopeptides were a variety of oligomannose, hybrid, and complex glycans, with or without sialylation and (core) fucosylation. Most of the observed diversity corresponded to hybrid/complex carbohydrates (Figures 1A, 1B, S1C, and S1D and Tables S1 and S2). The detection of glycans with different extent of processing on coronavirus S glycoproteins is reminiscent of the composite nature of the HIV Env (Struwe et al., 2018) or Lassa virus GP (Watanabe et al., 2018) glycan shields. The large number and combinatorial diversity of N-linked glycans covering the surface of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S could represent a challenge to overcome for antigen recognition.",

To address this question, we used LC-MS/MS to characterize in parallel S oligosaccharides on the MERS-CoV England1 and Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)/2012 isolates produced using African green monkey VeroE6 cells, as well as on the purified MERS-CoV S 2P ectodomain trimer recombinantly produced using HEK293F cells. We observed extensive overlap of the types of glycans detected across virion-derived and ectodomain-derived MERS-CoV samples, including the presence of hybrid and complex glycans (Figures S2\nA and S2B and Tables S1, S2, and S3). Our data agree with previous work detecting hybrid/complex glycans N-linked to S present in the membrane of authentic SARS-CoV virions (Krokhin et al., 2003, Ritchie et al., 2010), which is consistent with our analysis of the SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain trimer. Our data indicate that at least a fraction of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV virions produced in a cell are exposed to the glycan-processing enzymes residing in the Golgi apparatus during assembly and budding.",

At least the two core N-acetyl glucosamine moieties are resolved for the majority of glycosylation sites, which extend from the surface of both the S1 and S2 subunits. Although both glycoproteins are densely decorated with N-linked glycans, by comparison, the surface of the HIV Env trimer is obstructed by twice as many glycans per accessible surface area. MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV S trimers share that the regions surrounding the S1/S2 cleavage site and the fusion peptide (near the S2 cleavage site) are more sparsely glycosylated than the rest of each trimer (Figures 1C and 1D). These glycan holes could be important for providing access to activating host proteases and for allowing membrane fusion to take place unimpeded at the onset of infection (Walls et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2015). We suggest that the identified glycan holes could be exploited for epitope-focused immunogen design or therapeutic intervention against coronaviruses. This is supported by the presence of neutralizing antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region in SARS-CoV survivor sera (Zhang et al., 2004), the high sequence conservation of this region among coronavirus S glycoproteins (Walls et al., 2016a), and the identification of a neutralization epitope within a comparable breach of the HIV-1 Env glycan shield (McCoy et al., 2016).",

Cryo-EM analysis of the stabilized MERS-CoV S 2P glycoprotein ectodomain in complex with the LCA60 Fab fragment showed full saturation with one Fab bound to each B domain of the homotrimeric S. 3D classification revealed that the complex adopts two distinct conformational states (Figures 2\nA\u20132D and S3\nA\u2013S3E and Table S4), corresponding to two B domains closed and one B domain open (state 1, \u223c50%), as well as one B domain closed and two B domains open (state 2, \u223c50%).

The binding interface of LCA60 and MERS-CoV S involves protein/protein and protein/glycan contacts. The 17-residue long CDRH3 contacts the \u03b28 strand and the preceding loop within the RBM. Specifically, residue W108LCA60 inserts between the B domain residues P531MERS-CoV and Y541MERS-CoV on one side and the glycan N-linked to the A domain residue N166MERS-CoV from a neighboring protomer on the other side (Figures 3C and S4\n). CDRH2 also contacts the loop preceding strand \u03b28 via electrostatic interactions. CDRL3 contacts the MERS-CoV strands \u03b26 and \u03b29 and the loop preceding strand \u03b28, whereas CDRL1 interacts with the loops preceding strands \u03b26 and \u03b28 (Figures 3A\u20133C). Domain A glycans at positions N166MERS-CoV and N236MERS-CoV appear to contact the Fab bound to the B domain of a neighboring protomer (Figures 3A\u20133D and S4). The glycan N-linked to N487MERS-CoV of one protomer extends toward the Fab CDRH2 bound to the closed B domain of the neighboring protomer (Figure 3D) but is much less well resolved or unresolved in the other two protomers due to the absence of contact with neighboring LCA60 Fabs. The multiple contacts observed between LCA60 and oligosaccharides on the surface of the protein illustrates that the antibody accommodates MERS-CoV S glycan for binding and neutralization. Since the residues participating to the epitope and the glycosylation sequons at positions N166, N236, and N487 are conserved in >99.5% of MERS-CoV isolates, LCA60 is predicted to broadly neutralize most MERS-CoV viruses sequenced to date, although the chemical composition and occupancy of each glycan could modulate binding. LCA60 therefore shares similarities with several HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, which interact to varying degree with carbohydrates N-linked to the Env glycoprotein (Scharf et al., 2015, Stewart-Jones et al., 2016).",

It also suggests that the K493EMERS-CoV substitution could alter the positioning of the \u03b25-\u03b26 loop, which might in turn prevent CDRL1 from approaching the B domain, thereby providing a potential explanation for the observed loss of binding (Corti et al., 2015). The T489AMERS-CoV substitution would remove the glycan that extends toward the Fab CDRH2 bound to the closed B domain of the neighboring protomer (Figure 3D). The observed abrogation of LCA60 binding for the T489AMERS-CoV mutant (Corti et al., 2015) might be explained by a loss of these protein/glycan contacts, although only one out of the three bound Fabs interact with the glycan at position N487MERS-CoV.",

This observation supports the finding that LCA60 and DPP4 compete for binding to MERS-CoV S (Corti et al., 2015).

Cryo-EM characterization of the stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P glycoprotein in complex with the S230 Fab revealed that the particle images could be divided into SARS-CoV S/S230 complex with (state 1) or without (state 2) one closed B domain (Figures 4\nA\u20134D and S3F\u2013S3J and Table S4). 3D classification of the cryo-EM data revealed that the state 1 complex features multiple orientations of each of the two S230 Fabs associated with intermediate and open conformations of the B domains. In the SARS-CoV S/S230 state 2 complex structure, the three B domains are open, albeit with conformations deviating from 3-fold symmetry, with the three bound Fabs protruding away from the S trimer apex (Figures 4C and 4D). We obtained asymmetric reconstructions at 4.2 \u00c5 and 4.5 \u00c5 resolution of the SARS-CoV S/S230 complex in states 1 and 2, respectively (Figures 4A\u20134D and S3H\u2013S3J and Table S4). The large conformational heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV S/S230 complex contrasts with the limited number of structural states detected for the MERS-CoV S/LCA60 complex. The marked mobility of the B domain/S230 regions, which adopt a continuum of conformations in both structures, limited the resolution of this part of the map. We therefore determined a crystal structure of the isolated S230 Fab at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution to assist interpretation of the data (Table S5).",

The S230 epitope is centered around L443SARS-CoV and places the CDRH2 residue F59S230 and the CDRH3 residues Y106S230, F107S230, and Y110S230 near Y408SARS-CoV, Y442SARS-CoV, F460SARS-CoV, and Y475SARS-CoV. The fitting is therefore consistent with the identification of the L443RSARS-CoV substitution as the only escape mutant isolated thus far using the SARS-CoV Urbani strain (Rockx et al., 2008), since introduction of a charged residue would affect binding to this epitope.",

This observation supports our previous results, suggesting that S230 and ACE2 compete to bind to SARS-CoV S (Rockx et al., 2008). In contrast to LCA60, which could recognize all possible arrangements of the B domain, S230 only interacts with intermediate and open states, but not with the closed conformation. Since the interaction sites of both S230 and ACE2 are only accessible in the partially or fully open B domain conformations, binding of either of these two proteins to SARS-CoV S would sterically prevent sampling of the closed state (Figures 4A\u20134D).",

Incubation of the wild-type SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer (i.e., without stabilizing mutations) with 1.6 \u03bcg/mL trypsin (w/v) to recapitulate proteolytic priming led to cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary (Belouzard et al., 2009), as observed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S5\nA). Analysis of the negatively stained sample showed that the SARS-CoV S trimers largely remained in the prefusion conformation and were stable for several days on ice or at room temperature (Figures 6A and 6B). Complex formation between Fab S230 and wild-type SARS-CoV S led to formation of postfusion rosettes, and the frequency of this transition was enhanced with longer incubation times and/or by trypsin cleavage (Figures 6C\u20136F, S5B, and S5C). The S1 subunit acts as a \u201cchaperone,\u201d contributing to stabilize S2 in the prefusion state by reducing its propensity to transition to the postfusion conformation. Proteolytic cleavage at the S1/S2, S2\u2019 sites or shedding of the S1 subunit, however, were not strictly required for refolding of the S ectodomain trimer to occur (Figures 6C 6E, 6G, and 6I).",

Refolding of coronavirus S glycoproteins to the postfusion conformation can be detected by the appearance of a proteinase-K-resistant band migrating at approximately 55 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This molecular species comprises the postfusion 6-helix bundle, assembled from the heptad repeats 1 and 2, since its formation could be inhibited in the presence of a heptad-repeat-derived peptide that prevents completion of the conformational transition (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2009). Addition of the S230 Fab (Figure 7\nA) or the ACE2 ectodomain (Figure 7B) to SARS-CoV S-pseudotyped MLV in the presence of trypsin led to the formation of a proteinase-K-resistant band migrating at approximately 55 kDa, thereby demonstrating that both the antibody and the natural receptor promoted S fusogenic conformational changes in the context of a membrane-embedded full-length S.",

Since binding of ACE2 to the isolated B domain was reported to have an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) in the nanomolar range (Li et al., 2005c), one would expect that full saturation should occur rapidly in the conditions of our experiments (100-fold concentration excess over the KD). Previous reports, however, suggested a lower affinity of the full-length S trimer, relative to the isolated B domain, for ACE2 (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018, Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2009, Song et al., 2018). We propose that the conformational landscape of the B domains in the context of the SARS-CoV S trimer, sampling open and closed conformations, decreases the apparent binding affinity for ACE2 and S230 due to masking of their binding sites in the closed state. A similar effect has previously been described for ubiquitin (Michielssens et al., 2014). The higher binding affinity of S230 for SARS-CoV S, compared to ACE2 (Figure S7\n), resulted in increased complex formation, which explains the more efficient Fab-mediated membrane fusion activation compared to the receptor (Figures 6C\u20136J and S6).",

This finding is an unprecedented example of functional mimicry, whereby an antibody activates membrane fusion by recapitulating the action of the receptor. It remains to be investigated whether binding of S230 triggers virus-cell fusion when particles are bound to the surface of cells.",

            "text": "Comparison of the binding modes of LCA60 and S230 with those of DPP4 and ACE2 provides a framework to understand the unique mechanism of coronavirus-membrane-fusion activation. Opening of each of the three B domains reduces the number of interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits and specifically releases the constraints imposed on the heptad-repeat 1-central helix hairpin, which is known to completely refold during the membrane fusion process (Walls et al., 2017). The 660-\u00c52 decrease in buried surface area at the interface between the S1 and S2 subunits upon opening of the three B domains destabilizes the pre-fusion state and increases its probability of refolding, as observed upon complex formation with ACE2 or S230. Proteolytic activation is likely required to ensure that S glycoproteins will work in synergy, with proper spatial and temporal coordination, to drive fusion of the viral and host membranes. The large number of S glycoproteins decorating the surface of coronaviruses suggests that multiple trimers work in concert for formation of a fusion pore. We expect this activation mechanism to hold true for all coronaviruses using domain B for interacting with their proteinaceous receptor. We view the S1 subunit as a molecular chaperone, stabilizing the prefusion state of the fusion machinery, and coordinating receptor binding with membrane fusion. In summary, coronaviruses appear to have evolved a fine-tuned balance between masking of the RBM, to limit neutralization by the humoral host immune response, and their necessary exposure, to enable receptor recognition and infection of host cells.",

Reference free 2D classification was used to parse 240,000 particles from the original 500,000 particle images using Relion3.0. An initial model was generated from PDBID 5W9J with all MERS-CoV S domain B closed and removing the G4 Fab (Pallesen et al., 2017). Relion3.0 3D classification with C1 symmetry was utilized to select the \u223c126,000 best particles for state 1 and the \u223c114,000 best particles for state 2. CTF refinement in Relion3.0 was used to refine per-particle defocus values. Particles images from each state were subjected to the Bayesian polishing procedure implemented in Relion3.0 (Zivanov et al., 2018, Zivanov et al., 2019) and 3D refinement before performing 3D classification, without refining angle and shifts, using soft masks focusing on the B domains and Fabs with a tau factor of 50. 82,000 and 78,000 particles were selected for states 1 and 2, respectively. Particle images from state 1 underwent another round of domain B/LCA60 focused classification to select 54,000 particles used for the final reconstruction.

The parameters of the microscope contrast-transfer function were estimated with GCTF (Zhang, 2016). Particles were automatically picked with DoGPicker (Voss et al., 2009) through the Appion interface (Lander et al., 2009). Particle images were extracted and processed with Relion3.0 (Kimanius et al., 2016) with a box size of 768 pixels2 binned to 72 pixels2 (for 2D classification), 128 pixels2 (for 3D classification) or 384 pixels2 (for 3D refinement, yielding a pixel size of 1.37\u00c5). Two rounds of Relion reference-free 2D classification were used to select \u223c350,000 particles clustering in well-defined class averages. An initial model was generated from a SARS-CoV S structure with all B domains closed (PDB: 5X58) (Yuan et al., 2017). Relion 3D classification without applying symmetry was utilized to select \u223c162,000 particle images for state 1 (including numerous conformations of the two bound Fabs as well as partial occupancy) and \u223c126,000 particle images for state 2 (including numerous conformations of the three bound Fabs as well as partial occupancy). Particle images in each subset were then subsequently subjected to a new round of 3D classification without imposing symmetry and using the same initial model as for the previous round. A subset of \u223c65,000 particle images from state 1 and \u223c71,000 particle images from state 2 were selected based on reduced conformational heterogeneity of the bound Fabs (which exhibit a continuum of conformational states) and independently used to run 3D auto-refinements using Relion. Particle images from each state were subjected to the Bayesian polishing procedure implemented in Relion3.0 (Zivanov et al., 2018, Zivanov et al., 2019) and 3D refinement before performing 3D classification, without refining angle and shifts, using soft masks focusing on the B domains and Fabs with a tau factor of 30. \u223c23,000 and 20,000 particles were selected for states 1 and 2, respectively, based on mobility of the bound Fabs which were less well resolved than SARS-CoV S (especially the S2 subunit) in the maps. Finally, CryoSPARC non-uniform refinement (Punjani et al., 2017) was used to obtain the final reconstructions at 4.2 \u00c5 and 4.5 \u00c5 resolution for states 1 and 2, respectively. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003, Scheres and Chen, 2012) and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution (Chen et al., 2013). Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening was carried out using CryoSPARC.",

The in-solution digestions of the recombinant ectodomain were searched against a custom database of recombinant coronavirus spike proteins, proteases, and common contaminants. The in-gel digestion experiments were first searched against a database comprised of the full MERS-CoV proteome and the full Chlorocebus sabaeus (virus produced in VeroE6 cells) or human proteome (ectodomain produced in HEK293F cells) retrieved from UniProt, with variable N-linked glycosylations omitted from the search to identify background contaminants. The top 16 contaminants were then assembled together with the S sequence into a focused database for the glycopeptide identifications. In all experiments, up to three missed cleavages were permitted using C-terminal cleavage at R/K for trypsin, F/Y/W/M/L for chymotrypsin, R/K/F/Y/W/M/L for trypsin-chymotrypsin, T/A/S/V for alpha lytic protease, and N-terminal cleavage at D for AspN. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and carbamidomethylation of lysine as variable common 1, glycan modifications as variable common 2, with a variable common max. parameter of 3. The N-linked glycan databases of Byonic were merged into a single non-redundant set of glycan compositions for the searches. All reported glycopeptides in the Byonic results files were manually inspected for quality of fragment assignments. All glycopeptide identifications were merged into a single non-redundant list per sequon. Glycans were classified based on HexNAc content as high-mannose (2 HexNAc), hybrid (3 HexNAc) or complex (> 3 HexNAc). Byonic search results were exported to mzIdentML format to build a spectral library in Skyline (MacLean et al., 2010) and extract peak areas for individual glycoforms from MS1 scans. The full database of variable N-linked glycan modifications from Byonic was manually added to the Skyline project file in XML format. Byonic search results from in-gel digestions of both virion samples and ectodomain were merged into a single spectral library and manually inspected for quantitation. Reported peak areas were pooled based on the number of HexNAc, Fuc or NeuAc residues to distinguish high-mannose/hybrid/complex glycosylation, fucosylation and sialylation, respectively.",
