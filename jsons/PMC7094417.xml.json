Microwaves (MWs) are electromagnetic waves with frequency ranging from 300 GHz to 300 MHz and have been proven to exhibit germicidal activity. Rapid development in MW technology for industrial and household applications has prompted significant interest for environmental concerns. Many studies have utilized MWs to inactivate microorganisms in solid, liquid, water phases, and a few studies on airborne microbes (Awuah, Ramaswamy, Economides, & Mallikarjunan, 2005; Mainelis et al., 2002; Mawioo, Rweyemamu, Garcia, Hooijmans, & Brdjanovic, 2016; Takashima, Miyakawa, & Kanno, 2007; Wang, Zhang, & Liu, 2018). The application of MW technology for environmental concerns is limited by energy efficiency, because MW energy is primarily converted to heat the media instead of inactivating the microbial cells (Wu & Yao, 2013). However, the comprehensive investigation on the utilization pathway and energy efficiency during MW irradiation has not been conducted yet.",

Moreover, MW irradiation has been proven to present non-thermal effects on cell viability by inducing variations in ionic homeostasis within cells. Kesari et al., reported one possible way in which MW irradiation induced changes in the apoptotic process in cells is that microwave radiation can cause membrane permeability changes and DNA/RNA damages (Kesari, 2017).",

The result was in accordance with the previous study in which increased protein levels E. coli cell solutions were observed after MW irradiation (Dreyfuss & Chipley, 1980). Protein and DNA molecules are generally very large to pass through the undamaged cell membrane. It was suggested that MW might interact with the cell membrane, resulting in irreversible changes in its permeability. The membrane provides a permeability barrier to the passage of small ions such as K+ and Ca2+ (Campanha, Ana Cl\u00e1udia, Iguatemy Louren\u00e7o, Vergani, & Spolidorio, 2007). The leakages of K+ and Ca2+ observed in the present investigation indicated a disruption of the permeability barrier.",

The mechanisms of MW inactivation of microbes differ in airborne and waterborne samples. The thermal effect was the main factor in waterborne E. coli disinfection by MW. By contrast, the mechanism of MW inactivation of airborne E. coli was mainly attributed to non-thermal effects.",
