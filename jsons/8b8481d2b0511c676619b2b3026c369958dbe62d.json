The disease it causes is the 'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)' [2] .",

A lower incidence has been reported in children and this might be due to the fact that children are generally well cared for and thus at lower risk for exposure to infected people. Other possible reasons are immature ACE 2 receptors, presence of antibodies to different viruses especially in the winter months when they get multiple upper respiratory tract infections and a developing immune system which reacts differently to the virus [4] . A general observation is that older age and existence of underlying co-morbidities (e.g. respiratory disease, hypertension and cardiovascular disease) are associated with poorer outcomes [5] .",

Dental procedures involve face-to-face contact between the practitioner and patient, aerosolization of body fluids, exposure to saliva, blood and handling of sharp instruments. ACE 2 receptors to which the virus binds are ubiquitous throughout the respiratory tract and salivary gland duct epithelium in the human mouth, and transmission is possible from there [7] . Dental patients may cough or sneeze during treatment and their salivary (and possibly blood) secretions can become aerosolized during use of ultrasonic instruments or high-speed handpieces. Dental instruments may become contaminated or be exposed and these infected instruments can cause infections through puncture of or direct contact with mucous membranes and hands [7] . An article in the New York Times placed dentists at the highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection [8] . It is therefore imperative that guidelines and protocols are made for effectively and efficiently handling patients with COVID-19 in the dental clinic and minimizing risk of nosocomial transmissions.",

Physical barriers in reception areas and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used to limit close contact with infectious patients. Use of rubber dams, high-volume evacuation and proper sterilization protocols after each patient have also been highlighted. A 1% hydrogen peroxide (or a 0.2% povidone) solution should be used as a pre-procedural mouth rinse. Patients should be educated about hand and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, and proper disposal of contaminated items. Hand sanitizers (with 60-95% alcohol), tissues and no-touch receptacles for disposal should also be provided in public areas of the clinic. Waste generated through treating COVID-19 patients should be properly disposed of using a 'gooseneck' ligation [7] .
