Although CPV2c was first detected in 2003, the results presented herein clearly show that CPV2c has become the predominant variant since the year 2008, as 91% of the samples analyzed were found to carry the typical aa substitution Glu426 (Table 1 and Fig. 2). An additional mutation located at an exposed domain of the VP2 capsid protein (Glu426-Ala440) was also found in some of the CPV2c samples (Fig. 1), which is in agreement with previous reports (Decaro et al., 2009b, Kapil et al., 2007, Hong et al., 2007, Chinchkar et al., 2006, Kang et al., 2008). It is interesting to point out that this mutation was found exclusively in samples collected during the years 2009 and 2010, indicating its recent appearance in the Argentine dog population.",

Similar results were reported by our laboratory in the case of calf neonatal diarrhea caused by rotavirus (Bellinzoni et al., 1989). A strong increase in the level of colostral antibodies was demonstrated in this case through immunization of pregnant dams 40 days prior to delivery or by feeding exposed calves with hyperimmune colostrum. Therefore, vaccination of pregnant bitches might also increase the specific colostral and milk antibody levels in dogs, which can help dealing with the CPV2c infections in young puppies. Another possibility might be the development of improved vaccines or the updating of the vaccination schedules, in order to induce effective early protective responses.",
