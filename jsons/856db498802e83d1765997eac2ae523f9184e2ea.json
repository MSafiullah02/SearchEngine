After the announcement of lockdown in Italy on 9 March 2020, situation was becoming stable since last days of March. In view of this, it is important to forecast the COVID-19 evaluation of Italy condition and the possible effects, if this lock down could continue for another 60 days. Methods: COVID-19 infected patient data has extracted from the Italian Health Ministry website includes registered and recovered cases from mid February to end March. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA forecasting package with R statistical model was done. Results: Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of infected patients could be reach the value of 182,757, and recovered cases could be registered value of 81,635 at end of May.",

Sooner or later World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus as novel corona virus(nCOV-19) or COVID-19. By early January 2020, about 59 suspected cases were identified in province of Wuhan. At the beginning, the disease started as a local epidemic of China, but subsequently it quickly escalated all over the world, being transmitted by international travelers. At the present, there is no any scientific evidence for where it has originated. Currently it is confirmed as a global pandemic and dozens of western countries are alarmed by this severe outbreak of corona virus.",

We can imagine the gravity of this pandemic situation by looking into these facts. In Italy, death toll from corona virus jumped over 15,000 deaths since end of February and is still ongoing, whereas the number of infected cases from USA surpass about more than half Million population. Due to easy spreading of COVID-19, most national governments including Italy announced lock down and people are not allowed to come out from their homes. As of this, nearly 3.5 Billion global population went into self isolation. 4 The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that the incubation period (i.e., time elapse between exposure of pathogenic organism to symptom first appearance) of COVID-19 outbreak is 14 days. The basic reproduction number \"R naught\" or R 0 is a contagiousness indicator or infectious transmissibility of parasite agents. 5 In epidemic sciences and health literature R 0 is highly encountered to understand a slow outbreak of disease. For instance, if R 0 is equal to one, this means that average person who got disease could transmit over single individual. According to WHO, R 0 for COVID-19 is confirmed around 2.0e2.5. Recent modeling of R 0 from Italy confirmed by Lombardy researchers at early outbreak in between 2.76 to 3.25. 6 Lombardy region is considered as epicenter of corona virus outbreak in Italy. 6, 7 Most people were died here than anywhere else in the world and later virus spread all over country with more than 98,000 confirmed cases. On 9 March 2020, the Italian prime minister Mr. G Conte had given announcement of imposed national quarantine, restricting the people movement unless for health emergency or unavoidable work needs. Statistics become consciously optimistic and daily number of new registered are becoming constantly stable since last week of March. However, because of both human-to-human and asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, it is important to understand virus reproduction cases after this Italy lock down. Therefore, we developed a data driven model to forecast COVID-19 outbreak daily registered cases and recovered cases, also estimated the chance of low infected patient cases for next 60 days of Italy quarantine.",

Hospitals and medical centers are successfully handling patient flow to local hospitals and addresses individual issues about bed facilities, overcrowding in emergency departments, and patient transfer to other specialized facilities. 14 All these critical circumstances were considered to understand what exactly happened in between the period of lockdown (9 March 2020) announcement and incubation period (possibly 23 March 2020). It can be observed in the Fig. 6 , the residual plot of positive COVID-19 cases during the given period. From the plot, it is clear that the first two weeks trend seems normal and after 3 March 2020, a huge spike in case variance can be observed (i.e., 24 to 26th days after quarantine had begun).",

These three parameters (p, d, q) can used to define ARIMA models, thus alternatively it is called as 'ARIMA (p, d, q)' model. There are two types of models in ARIMA such as Generalized random walk modes (i.e., well tuned to discard all residual correlations) and Generalized exponential smoothing modes (i.e., which can incorporate the long term trends and seasonality).The mathematical definitions are well explained below. If we consider 'B' is back shift operator which causes the observation that multiplies to be backward shifting in time by 1 interval.For any time series Z at any period t is considered as BZ t Z Z t\u00c01 , and for n powers of B : B n Z t Z Zt \u00c0 n ARIMA is joint model of two individual models (autoregressive AR (p) and model average MA (q) ) is integrated by difference variable I(d). In ARIMA models non-stationary time series is defined stationary by application of finite difference in data points.The general multiplicative ARIMA/SARIMA framework can be written:where B is backshift operator, and f P \u00f0B s \u00de Z 1 \u00c0 f 1 B s \u00c0 f 2 B 2s \u00c0 :::::::: \u00c0 f p B ps \u00f02\u00de",
