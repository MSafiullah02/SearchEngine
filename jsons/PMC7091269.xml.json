No homolog of nsp7 has so far been identified in other viral systems (van Aken et al. 2006). Recently, a novel nsp4 cleavage site, conserved among arteriviruses, has been identified within nsp7 giving rise to two sub-domains, nsp7\u03b1 and 7\u03b2, even though immunoprecipitation analyses could only identify the former (van Aken et al. 2006). In order to further our understanding of the role of nsp7, we have determined the solution structure of nsp7\u03b1, which has a unique protein fold but possesses no recognizable functional motifs (unpublished data). In this note we report the 1H, 15N and 13C backbone and side chains resonance assignments for nsp7\u03b1.",
