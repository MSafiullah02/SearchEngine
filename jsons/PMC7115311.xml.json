All participants were recruited from a 1,800-bed acute care hospital in Hong Kong, but although we used a convenience sampling method and attempted free sequencing, the sequence was not by randomization. Reflecting the female predominance in the nursing profession, 84% of the subjects were female and 16% were male. The study included 10 temporary undergraduate nursing students (TUNSs) who had more than 2 years prework experience (ie, a job working in the hospital before promotion to nursing staff) in different departments, including 4-month rotations in surgical, medical, pediatric, orthopedic, neurosurgical, and accident and emergency departments. In addition to the TUNS, the sample included 4 health care assistants (HCAs), 30 Registered Nurses (RNs) or enrolled nurses (ENs), and 6 nursing officers (NOs), including advanced practice nurses (APNs). Because each subject completed the experiment on the same day, the response rate was 100% in this study. Two subjects performed the same glove removal method in the pretest and posttest and were replaced by two subjects who followed the specified processes. The total sample size was 50. The subjects\u2019 demographic data are summarized in Table 1\n.",

Once the product was completely dissolved, 2 L of water was added to form a suspension. For the study, 5 mL of the fluorescent solution was sprayed on each gloved palm (a total of 10 mL on both palms) (Fig 2\n). As mentioned earlier, fluorescent dye is not known to be harmful to the human body and can be injected into veins in a fundus fluorescein angiogram to safely and effectively diagnose eye problems.31 In the present study, the final fluorescent solution applied to on each gloved palm was similar to that used in fundus fluorescein angiography (0.05 g/5 mL).31 The subjects were instructed to repeat the following procedure 5 times: pull back a plunger to fill a bladder wash syringe with 60 mL of air and then expel all 60 mL of air. This procedure was considered a common simulation of a simple daily nursing procedure, such as a Ryle tube feeding or bladder washout. This simple procedure was completed before doffing gloves.",

At 2 feet from the rubbish bin, we detected small patches of fluorescent stain after the two glove removal methods, an average of 15.9 and 10.3 patches for the pretest and 9.2 and 6.7 for the posttest. At 3 feet, the number of these patches was reduced significantly, from 11.8 and 7.8 for the pretest to 3 and 2.9 for the posttest. Significantly fewer large patches were found, averaging 0.1-0.2 patch at 2 feet and virtually 0 at 3 feet. These findings might imply the following potential mechanisms for transmission of diseases spread by glove removal: (1) Glove removal mainly induces environmental contamination, especially on the front of removed gloves and the cover of rubbish bin, rather than hand contamination. (2) Contamination levels differ between the 2-foot and 3-foot distances from the rubbish bins (the former is higher). The environmental contamination would be greatly reduced by increasing the distance by about 1 foot when discarding used gloves. And (3) small patches are the more frequent form of contamination.

These observations show that the CDC glove removal method significantly decreased the rate of contamination of the environment and HCWs, indicating that the CDC recommendations can help eliminate contamination of the area between the HCW and the environment. These findings need to be shared with HCWs to emphasize the importance of evidence-based practice to their daily practice. Most HCWs have learned the CDC glove removal steps after the SARS outbreak of 2003, and many attend infection control lectures periodically to refresh their practice. Nonetheless, some of the subjects had forgotten the CDC glove removal steps before watching the video for this study. Our hospital has many posters reminding frontline HCWs about hand hygiene and the sequence for removing PPE, yet none of these HCWs followed the CDC glove removal procedure. As far as the results of this study are concerned, the CDC glove removal procedure is certainly essential to prevent cross-infection in daily practice. Thus, we recommend posting related information and continue reminding HCWs about infection control measures through lectures, talks, pamphlets, posters, and supervisory interactions.",

Our data fill this research gap and suggest many helpful implications for infection prevention and control. Our findings suggest that HCWs should avoid standing in front of a patient, other HCWs, or clean areas such as the nursing station while removing gloves. Such measures may be included in the usual infection control measures that facilitate the prevention of cross-infection and environmental contamination. Likewise, the placement of the rubbish bin is also an important point, given that most HCWs remove their gloves in front of the bin. We recommend not placing the rubbish bin under the sink used for hand hygiene. Standing in front of the sink while removing gloves could result in contamination of the edge of the sink. Contamination and recontamination on the front side of their working clothes also might occur when HCWs approach the sink for hand hygiene afterward. Thus, we recommend that the rubbish bin be placed at least 2 feet away from the sink.",

HCAs might lack systemic knowledge of nursing science, especially in the area of infection control because they were only trained for 1 month in such basic nursing procedures as measuring urine output, emptying urine bags, providing tube feedings, and changing napkins before they were employed. Their use of a personal or causal glove removal procedure in their daily practice might have led to higher rate of environmental contamination. This findings indicates that minor staff should pay more attention to infection control as an essential part of their daily practice, and that closer supervision should be provided. The HCAs did demonstrate decreased environmental contamination after viewing the CDC glove removal video and demonstration; therefore, there were no differences in ranking in the posttest period. This finding supports the importance of training and supervision for minor staff on proper glove removal.",

Despite these limitations, this study provides a valuable first step in examining how contaminants spread during glove removal and underscore the importance of following the CDC\u2019s glove removal procedure.
