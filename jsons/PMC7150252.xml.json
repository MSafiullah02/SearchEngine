            "text": "Although the last decade has brought us tremendous information on the frequency and distribution of neoplasia, there is still little definitive information on the cause of neoplasm formation in ferrets. Many theories abound, but few have supportive evidence. The most common theories are as follows:1.Genetic (familial) predisposition. Genetic or chromosomal aberrations have yet to be studied in domestic ferrets, but the tremendous incidence of neoplasia in American bloodlines of ferrets compared with their European counterparts certainly lends credence to this widely held belief. Fox et al.16 document a syndrome of multiple neoplasms in an adult ferret that closely resembles multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 in humans, a condition caused by a genetic mutation.2.Infectious agents. Suspicious cluster outbreaks of malignant lymphoma in laboratory colonies and rescue operations1, 12 have sparked the investigation of a possible viral cause for\nthis neoplasm in ferrets. Transforming retroviruses are known to be responsible for the development of lymphoma in other species, including humans, cats, and rabbits. Erdman et al.14 in 1995 demonstrated the transmissibility of this neoplasm between ferrets by using cell-free inocula, furthering this theory, although a prolonged incubation time was required. Helicobacter mustelae, a ubiquitous inhabitant of the stomach of ferrets, has been circumstantially incriminated in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma,15, 17, 21 which is enhanced when coupled with ingestion of chemical carcinogens as promoters, as well as in the development of gastric B-cell lymphomas.11\n3.Early neutering. There is widespread speculation that early neutering at 4 to 6 weeks of age, a common practice in the United States, may be responsible for the high incidence of adrenal neoplasia in this country. In Europe and Australia, where this is not practiced, adrenal neoplasia is rarely seen. A recent publication in The Netherlands31 indicated a link between age at neutering and age at the onset of hyperadrenocorticism; however, it did not show an increased incidence of hyperadrenocorticism in ferrets neutered at an early age.4.Light cycles. It has been suggested that the ferret's innate sensitivity to light may be upset by Americans\u2019 predilection for housing ferrets indoors with artificial lighting. In Europe, where most ferrets are housed outdoors and exposed to natural lighting cycles, the incidence of neoplasia, especially adrenocortical, is greatly decreased.4\n5.Diet. Theories abound concerning the impact of commercially prepared diets on the development of neoplasms in ferrets. The higher concentration of carbohydrates in commercially available food in the United States has been suggested as a primary cause for the increased incidence of insulinoma compared with rates seen in other countries, where raw whole prey (e.g., rats, mice) are fed as the dietary staple.4\n\n",

The data presented here (1525 cases), as well as that reported by others,2, 4, 6, 8, 24 are only an approximation of the distribution of neoplasia in North American ferrets. A number of factors affect the reporting of neoplasms for this species, including the economic status of the owner, proximity to veterinarians experienced in ferret diseases, opportunity for qualified histologic examination, and methods of reporting and retrieval. In spite of these factors, we believe that certain generalizations about the incidence of neoplasia in this species can be made.",

Pancreatic islet cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common neoplasms overall, with adrenocortical neoplasms the second most common. In these studies, lymphoma was both the most common hematopoietic neoplasm and the most common malignancy. Between 12% and 20% of cases in each study had multiple tumor types, with insulinoma and adrenocortical carcinoma most often seen concurrently.4, 24 However, the presence of multiple tumor types in an individual animal should not be interpreted as a neoplastic syndrome arising from a common tumorigenic mechanism. In a study of 66 cases in which ferrets had multiple concurrent neoplasms,24 there was no evidence of an association between tumor type and multiplicity. Because endocrine neoplasia is extremely common today in ferret bloodlines in North America, it seems reasonable that multiple tumors would develop over time in middle-aged or geriatric ferrets.",

Although early literature reports suggested an increased incidence of neoplasia in the left adrenal cortex (perhaps because its comparative ease of removal), results of our survey indicate that the distribution of adrenocortical neoplasms approaches 50% (1:1.06, left vs right).

Prognosis is based on the degree of malignancy and infiltration of local tissue. In this review, both benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath neoplasms were identified. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors as a general rule exhibit rapid growth and tend to infiltrate adjacent tissue to a higher degree than their benign counterparts, rendering complete excision more difficult. In many cases, repeat surgeries are required for a cure. Although these neoplasms may be seen at any site in the body, the tissues of the head (and, interestingly, the eyelid) appear to be a common site of origin (Fig. 9-9\n). Tumors of nerve sheath origin may be misdiagnosed as fibrosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma when immunohistochemical procedures are not used; however, the prognosis of these three low-grade malignancies is not appreciably different. Schwannoma is a similar neoplasm of perineural cells that generally has a benign course. These tumors should be surgically excised as quickly as possible after diagnosis because growth in areas with high skin tension may result in large defects that are difficult to close.",
