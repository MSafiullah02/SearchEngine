During infection, the virus and host become engaged in a dynamic duet, lasting from several hours to potentially years (in persistent infections), in which the virus initiates spatio-temporally ordered sequences of subcellular events, along the way dramatically altering cellular architecture and physiology. The host cell not only provides building blocks such as nucleotides and amino acids for viral metabolism but also can provide a structural platform for replication and viral assembly (Uetz et al., 2006). Many RNA viruses and even some DNA viruses such as the poxviruses rely on host intracellular membranes for replication (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008, Salonen et al., 2005). In particular plus-strand RNA virus families, so called because upon infection their RNA can be directly translated into protein by host machinery, replicate and assemble on modified intracellular membranes (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008, Salonen et al., 2005). The group of plus-strand RNA viruses includes many important human pathogens like picornaviruses (such as the enteroviral genus members poliovirus [PV] and Coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3], rhinovirus, and hepatitis A), coronaviruses (SARS), and flaviviruses (hepatitis C virus [HCV], Yellow Fever virus, Dengue Fever virus, West Nile virus).",

Replication membranes for picornaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses appear to originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Schlegel et al., 1996), whereas for togaviruses and nodaviruses the endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria are thought to be the membrane source (Magliano et al., 1998). Some viral replication enzymes have sequences that integrate into the host membrane bilayer, such as NS4B, a polytopic membrane protein of HCV (Lundin et al., 2003), and the 2B and 3A proteins of picornaviruses (Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990). Many, however, are soluble proteins, whose mechanism of membrane association is unknown.",

It has been speculated that membranes may limit diffusion of viral/host proteins and viral RNA, thereby increasing the local concentration of reaction elements; or that membranes may provide specific lipids that participate in the replication reactions themselves (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008). A number of cellular factors have been implicated in viral RNA replication; e.g., several high-throughput siRNA screens have identified potential cellular factors whose knockdown reduces flavivirus replication (including components of the endosomal machinery, actin modulators, and phospholipid-modifying enzymes such as phosphatidylinositol-4 kinases), although the mechanism by which any of these proteins might regulate replication is not known (Berger et al., 2009, Borawski et al., 2009, Tai et al., 2009, Trotard et al., 2009, Vaillancourt et al., 2009). For PV and CVB3, both members of the enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family, we have shown that GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of the small Ras-family GTPase Arf1, was required for enteroviral RNA replication (Belov et al., 2007, Lanke et al., 2009). GBF1 catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Arf1, stabilizing membrane association, which in turn recruits various effectors to these membranes (Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004, Niu et al., 2005). In uninfected mammalian cells, GBF1 and Arf1 are both localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and the Golgi apparatus. Arf1's known major effectors at these sites include coat proteins such as COPI complex and clathrin, which regulate membrane budding, and phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III\u03b2 (PI4KIII\u03b2), which catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) lipids at the membrane bilayer (Godi et al., 1999, Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2004).",

We demonstrate how remodeling of the host secretory pathway by enteroviral replication proteins generates organelles with unique protein and lipid composition geared for replicating viral RNA. We show that a specific enteroviral protein modulates effector recruitment by GBF1 and Arf1, promoting PI4KIII\u03b2 recruitment to secretory organelle membranes. This leads to disassembly of conventional secretory organelles and assembly of \u201creplication organelles\u201d that are juxtaposed to ER exit sites. PI4KIII\u03b2 at these organelle membranes produces a PI4P lipid microenvironment, which facilitates membrane binding of enteroviral RNA polymerase and viral RNA synthesis. Finally, we find that flaviviruses, specifically HCV, also induce and depend on the PI4P lipid microenvironments for RNA replication. Thus PI4KIII\u03b2 is a key cellular protein exploited by several plus-strand RNA viruses for replication.",

Note that in uninfected cells Arf1 is colocalized at the Golgi/TGN/ERGIC with each of these components (Figures S3A\u2013S3G). We assessed the colocalization between Arf1 and these components, at the start (0 hr) and at 4 hr post-infection, by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients (Figure S4\n). In infected cells COPI, clathrin, and \u03b3-adaptin were dispersed across the cytoplasm while their total cellular levels remained unchanged as determined by western blotting (not shown). The lack of localization of these proteins to replication membranes was surprising given that Arf1 is able to bind and hydrolyze GTP at these sites (Belov et al., 2007) and hence a priori capable of recruiting these effectors. Consistent with the absence of coats, these organelles were not labeled with Golgi enzymes (Figure 2D; Movie S2), which typically sort into GBF1/Arf1-GTP/COPI membranes at the ERGIC and Golgi apparatus of uninfected cells (Figure S3C) (Lanoix et al., 1999). COPI-dependent membrane budding mediates anterograde transport from the ERGIC and hence is required for the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus (Lee et al., 2004). The absence of Golgi enzyme GalT localization to these organelles suggested a disruption of anterograde transport, and indeed at 4 hr post-infection the Golgi apparatus was completely disassembled (Movie S2); consistent with this, trafficking of secretory cargo to the cell surface was blocked (Figures S3H and S3I). In addition, ERGIC/Golgi matrix protein GM130 (Figure 2E) and endosomal components such as transferrin receptor (Figure S3J) were also absent from these membranes. Nevertheless, these organelles did contain a combination of other TGN, Golgi, and ERGIC components including TGN46, GGA1, Rab1b proteins as well as some ERGIC 53 (Figures 2F\u20132I; Figure S4). Recent studies have found that depletion of COPI proteins from cells can result in a loss of secretory pathway compartmentalization and the formation instead of membrane-bound structures that contain components of TGN, Golgi, and ERGIC proteins (Styers et al., 2008). Similarly, our findings here suggest that decoupling GBF1/Arf1 activity from COPI recruitment to membranes also results in a complete reorganization of the secretory pathway away from distinct separate conventional organelles.",

Given the absence of COPI or clathrin effectors at GBF1/Arf1-labeled replication organelles, we tracked the fate of PI4KIII\u03b2 during enteroviral infection. Before infection, Arf1 and PI4KIII\u03b2 were colocalized at the Golgi apparatus (Figure 3A, 0 hr), but at 4 hr post-infection, in striking contrast to COPI and clathrin, PI4KIII\u03b2 remained colocalized with Arf1 (Figure 3A, 4 hr). This was confirmed by calculation of its Pearson coefficient, which showed no change between these two time points (Figure S4). This localization remained for the rest of the infection (Figure 3A, 6hr) and was correlated with GBF1/Arf1 localization and activity, as Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment, which inactivates GBF1/Arf1 (by stabilizing the GBF1/Arf1-GDP complex) (Niu et al., 2005), dispersed Arf1 along with PI4KIII\u03b2 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, PI4KIII\u03b2 was not just spatio-temporally correlated with replication organelles but was in a physical association with the viral replication enzyme complex. Upon immunoprecipitation of PI4KIII\u03b2 from infected cells at 4 hr post-infection, the enteroviral 3A, 3AB, 3CD, and 3Dpol proteins, which are all components of the replication complex, coprecipitated with it (Figure 3C). Importantly, TGN46, which was spatio-temporally localized with Arf1 (and hence PI4KIII\u03b2) (Figure 2F), was not coprecipitated, indicating the specificity of the complex between PI4KIII\u03b2 and the viral replication proteins. In addition, immunoprecipitation with IgG alone did not precipitate PI4KIII\u03b2 or any of the viral proteins (not shown).",

Membrane-anchored 3A proteins from CVB3 and PV have been documented to activate Arf1 by binding GBF1 and are required for viral RNA replication (Belov et al., 2007, Wessels et al., 2006, Lanke et al., 2009). At low levels of transient expression, 3A-myc was localized to the Golgi apparatus as determined by colocalization with Golgin97 (Figure 4A), along with native GBF1 and Arf1 proteins (Figures 4B and 4C). Although GBF1/Arf1 was present at these structures, the levels of \u03b2COP, a component of the COPI coat complex, were decreased at these sites 2-fold compared to cells not expressing 3A-myc (Figure 4D, arrow; Figure 4G) whereas the total cellular \u03b2COP levels were unchanged (data not shown). Significantly, despite a decrease in \u03b2COP levels at 3A-labeled membranes, we found that PI4KIII\u03b2 was redistributed with an \u223c3-fold increase to these membranes relative to cells where 3A was absent (Figure 4E, arrow; Figure 4G). In comparison, recruitment to the Golgi of structurally homologous enzyme PI4KIII\u03b1 was unaffected by 3A-myc expression (Figures 4F and 4G). In cells expressing high levels of 3A-myc, the Golgi apparatus was disassembled and 3A was localized to discrete membranes juxtaposed to ER exit sites that were labeled with PI4KIII\u03b2 but lacked \u03b2COP and Golgi enzymes (Figures S5A\u2013S5D)\u2014a phenotype previously observed in CVB3-infected cells (Figure 2A, Figure 3A). Hence 3A expression alone enhanced the membrane recruitment of one Arf1 effector, PI4KIII\u03b2, over another, COPI, and caused disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, thus mimicking specific aspects of the virally infected phenotype.",

RNA replication could be inhibited at concentrations as low as 125 nM and when PIK93 was added at time points after start of replication, indicating a requirement for PI4KIII\u03b2 activity throughout the replication process; and PIK93, up to 2 \u03bcM, had little effect on cell viability (Figures S6A\u2013S6C). When we reduced PI4KIII\u03b2 levels with siRNA (Figures 5D\u20135F; Figure S2A) or transiently expressed a kinase-dead PI4KIII\u03b2 (PI4KIII\u03b2-KD) (T\u00f3th et al., 2006) (Figures 5G\u20135I), both PV and CVB3 viral RNA replication were considerably delayed (Figures 5F and 5I) and accumulated reduced viral RNA levels compared to nontargeting siRNA or GFP-expressing control cells.

We found that within \u223c30 min of PIK93 addition, \u223c60% of the FAPP1-PH-GFP associated with replication organelles was lost whereas the Arf1-RFP pattern was largely unaffected (Figures 6D and 6E). This demonstrated that a significant fraction of the PI4P lipids at replication sites were a product of PI4KIII\u03b2 activity and that Arf1 binding to membranes was not dependent on PI4P lipids. Furthermore it indicated that the PI4P lipid microenvironment at these membranes was not static but turning over, as in the absence of PI4 kinase activity, the lipids were quickly lost from these sites. This could be due to conversion back to PI, potentially as a result of endogenous Sac1 phosphatase activity or transport out of replication membranes. The lack of complete FAPP1-PH-GFP dispersal upon PIK93 treatment also suggested that other PI4 kinase family members might be harnessed for PI4P lipid synthesis as well during infection at these sites.",

We assayed for binding of 3Dpol to PI4P lipids by incubating purified recombinant 3Dpol with membrane strips spotted with different cellular lipids including PI4P. We found that 3Dpol specifically and preferentially bound to PI4P lipids over all other phosphatidylinositides and phospholipids (Figures 6F and 6G).

HCV, an enveloped virus that is a member of the flaviviruses, assembles its replication enzymes and replicates its RNA on remodeled ER membranes (W\u00f6lk et al., 2008). We coimmunostained the Huh7-derived liver cell line 3-5B(HCV), which contains autonomously replicating, subgenomic, dicistronic, selectable HCV RNAs from the infectious HCV-N1b strain as well as expressing HCV nonstructural proteins (Ikeda et al., 2002), with antibodies against PI4P lipids and the HCV protein NS5A. NS5A, a membrane-associated protein that is part of the HCV replication complex of enzymes and is colocalized with HCV RNA molecules (W\u00f6lk et al., 2008), allowed us to identify the cellular viral RNA replication sites. First by quantification of PI4P-associated antibody fluorescence we found that 3-5B(HCV) cells, compared to parental Huh7, had an \u223c45% increase in the total cellular levels of PI4P (Figure 6H). Second, whereas in the parental Huh7 cells the PI4P lipid pool was localized to the perinuclear Golgi apparatus/TGN region, in 3-5B(HCV) cells the abundant PI4P lipids were found colocalized with NS5A at discrete punctate sites all across the cytoplasm (Figure 6I, inset). Notably PI4KIII\u03b2 reduction by siRNA knockdown (>90% by immunofluorescence staining, not shown) had greater effect on lowering PI4P levels within 3-5B(HCV) cells compared to PI4KIII\u03b1 reduction, though it is likely that both enzymes contribute to the increased cellular PI4P levels (Figures 6J and 6K). Finally, to test whether PI4P lipids were also required for HCV RNA replication, we measured the replication of HCV J6/JFH (p7-Rluc2A) replicons (Jones et al., 2007) in Huh7 cells where we had depleted the PI4P lipid pool by transiently expressing the Sac1 phosphatase either alone or in combination with catalytically inactive PI4KIII\u03b2-KD. HCV RNA replication was inhibited by >50% when Sac1 was expressed alone, and the effect was greater (\u223c70%) in the presence of PI4KIII\u03b2-KD, as would be predicted (Figure 6L, Sac+PI4KIII\u03b2KD).

Viral RNA replication is a positive feedback loop, where newly synthesized viral RNA molecules are translated into increasing amounts of viral replication proteins including 3A, which then further replicate viral RNA. Since 3A modulates GBF1/Arf1 effector recruitment, its impact on GBF1/Arf1/coat/PI4KIII\u03b2 interactions will become inescapable as its levels rise. The selective recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 to membranes over COPI will eventually disrupt secretory membrane trafficking and lead to Golgi disassembly by decreasing anterograde transport from the ERGIC and intra-Golgi trafficking, both COPI-dependent processes (Lee et al., 2004) (Figure 7B, 2 hr). Furthermore 3A-bound membranes emerging de novo from ER exit sites will develop into PI4P lipid-enriched uncoated membranes (Figure 7B, 4 hr). In addition to forming replication organelles, disruption of secretory pathway integrity has been implicated in the suppression of cytokine secretion and MHC-dependent antigen presentation (Deitz et al., 2000), thus serving multiple functions for efficient enterovirus replication and propagation.",

Modulation of host secretory machinery by viral proteins and its consequences are highly complex. The localization of some components can be explained through affinity for either PI4P lipids (e.g., GGA1) or GBF1 (e.g., GGA1, Rab1b) (Monetta et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2007).

Whereas most enteroviral infections disrupt secretory trafficking, flaviviruses utilize the secretory pathway to mature into virions and exit the cell (Mackenzie and Westaway, 2007). HCV RNA is replicated on remodeled ER membranes whereas structural proteins are located to lipid droplets (Miyanari et al., 2007). Through a complex assembly process not yet understood virions bud out of the ER and are released from the cell through exocytosis. The presence of high levels of PI4P lipids at ER membranes, in addition to regulating HCV RNA replication, could impact the organization and kinetics of secretory trafficking and budding/export of HCV. Indeed secretory trafficking is attenuated in HCV-infected cells (Konan et al., 2003).",

However independent functions have recently emerged: several host proteins including CERT, OSBP, and FAPP1/2 specifically bind PI4P lipids (Lemmon, 2008); and PI4P lipids regulate selective autophagy and ER exit site biogenesis (Blumental-Perry et al., 2006, Yamashita et al., 2006). PI4P lipids can locally change membrane curvature (Ishiyama et al., 2002, McMahon and Gallop, 2005). PI4P lipid-enriched membranes during viral infection may generate high-curvature membrane pockets to shield viral components from host defense. Little is known about how soluble viral RNA polymerases are recruited to membranes. PI4P lipids may provide docking sites to concentrate viral proteins for efficient RNA synthesis. Enteroviral RdRp 3Dpol preferentially binds PI4P lipids over all other cellular lipid components, and PI4P depletion specifically perturbs viral RNA synthesis (Figure 5 and Figure 6). This raises the possibility that enteroviruses rewire host secretory machinery to generate PI4P lipid-enriched membranes to recruit to and concentrate on membrane RNA polymerases. Furthermore, PI4P lipid binding may also induce conformational changes and modulate RdRp enzymatic activity. The phosphoinositide-binding domain on 3Dpol is unknown and studies to identify the lipid-binding site and investigate its occurrence across different RdRps are underway.",

            "text": "In summary, we show that the PI4P lipid microenvironment is an important facilitator of plus-strand viral RNA replication. Enteroviruses reorganize the cellular secretory trafficking machinery away from building conventional secretory organelles to generate organelles whose membranes are enriched in PI4P lipids. Cellular PI4 kinases are key players in this process. The findings with both picornavirus and flavivirus family members highlight the importance of PI4P lipids and PI4 kinases for viral RNA replication and will instigate studies to determine how widespread this dependence on PI4P lipids is among RNA viruses and the mechanism by which these lipids modulate viral RNA synthesis machinery. Furthermore small molecules targeting PI4 kinases, such as PIK93, may provide a basis for the design of new classes of therapeutics against viral RNA replication.",

NNeo/3-5B(RG) cells were provided by Dr. Stanley Lemon (Univ. Texas-Galveston). This Huh7\u2013derived cell line contains autonomously replicating, subgenomic, dicistronic, selectable HCV RNAs from an infectious molecular clone HCV-N of genotype 1b virus and expresses the HCV non-structural proteins NS3-NS5B.The replicon-bearing cell line was cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 300 \u03bcg/mL G418. Huh7 was maintained in the same media described above in the absence of G418. To generate CVB3 viral stock, confluent HeLa cells were infected by CVB3 for 24 hr. The infected cells underwent freeze-and-thaw cycle 3 times, supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Virus titer was determined by plaque assays.Plasmids, Antibodies, and ChemicalsArf1-GFP, Arf1-RFP, \u025bCOP-GFP, GalT-YFP, Sar1T39N plasmids and anti-GBF1 antibodies were gifts of Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, NIH; Sac1 plasmid was gift of Peter Mayinger, OHSU;ERGIC53-GFP was gift of Theresa Ward, London School of Tropical Medicine; anti- CVB3_3A was gift of J.Lindsay Whitton, Scripps Research Institute; anti-GalT was gift of EG Berger, University of Zurich); anti-Arf1 was gift of Julie Donaldson, NIH; anti-HCV NS5A and HCV replicon J6/JFH (p7-Rluc2A)/delta E1 E2 were gifts of Charles Rice, The Rockefeller University; and PIK93 was gift of Kevin Shokat, UC Berkeley.

WI), Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fisher Scientific, PA), DMEM (Mediatech, VA), FBS (Atlanta biologicals, GA).Live-Cell ImagingAll imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM510META confocal laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, USA) equipped with lasers emitting 458nm, 488nm, 514nm, 565nm and 633nm laser lines. For all live-cell imaging cells were grown in coverslip bottomed Lab-Tek chambers (ThermoFisher, NY), and selected plasmids were transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied science, IN). After 16 hr, incubation medium were replaced with imaging medium (phenol red free complete media buffered with 25mM HEPES pH7.3). Cells were maintained on the microscope stage in an environmental chamber where temperature (37\u00b0C) and CO2 (5%) and humidity were controlled for the duration of experiment. For high-resolution light-level imaging only 40X and 63X oil immersion objectives with 1.4 numerical aperture were utilized with pinhole set at 1.2 Airy units. Time lapsed images were acquired every 5 min. For fluorescence quantification pinhole was opened up to collect fluorescence from the entire depth of fluorescent structure of interest. Fluorescence on selected regions of interest within images was quantified using either Zeiss LSM image analysis (Carl Zeiss, USA) or Image J (NIH, MD) software.Immunofluorescence and AnalysisCells were plated on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% formaldehyde PBS solution (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) at room temperature. Coverslips were permeabilized with either 0.2% Triton or 0.2% saponin and sequentially incubated with primary and fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies. To quantify the relative fluorescence of Arf1, GBF1, PI4KIII\u03b2, PI4KIII\u03b1 or \u03b2COP in 3A-myc labeled structures, images were analyzed using LSM-FCS software (Carl Zeiss, USA). The Golgi and cytosol regions of interest were selected for both 3A and neighboring non-3A expressing cells, and mean fluorescence intensity of Arf1, GBF1, PI4KIII\u03b2, PI4KIII\u03b1 and \u03b2COP in those regions were obtained. The relative fluorescence was determined by following formula: [(IGolgi-ICytosol) 3A cell /(IGolgi-ICytosol)non-3A expressing cell ] \u2217100, where IGolgi is the mean fluorescence intensity per pixel at the Golgi and ICytosol is the mean fluorescence intensity in the cytosol. PI4P staining on 3-5B cells was done as described previously (Jovic et al., 2009). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde PBS solution for 10 min and incubated with anti-PI4P (Echelon Biosciences, UT) and HCV NS5A antibodies in 0.2% Saponin, 0.5%BSA PBS solution for 1 hr followed by fluorophore \u2013tagged secondary antibodies for detection.Fluorescence In Situ HybridizationCodetection of protein (Arf1, GBF1) and RNA (CVB3 plus-strand RNA) in cells was adapted from http://www.singerlab.org/protocols. Alexa555 labeled CVB3 plus strand RNA specific \u223c500nt length probes were made using FISH Tag RNA kit (Invitrogen, CA). HeLa cells were infected with CVB3 for 4 hr, fixed with 4% formaldehyde followed by overnight permeabilization with 70% ethanol at 4\u00b0C. Cells were re-hydrated in 2XSSC buffer (300 mM sodium chloride, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 50% formamide and hybridized with Alexa555 labeled CVB3 plus strand RNA specific probe at 37\u00b0C overnight in hybridization buffer (10%dextran sulfate, 2 mM vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex, 0.02% RNase-free BSA, 40 \u03bcg E. coli tRNA, 2xSSC, 50%formamide, 30ng of probe). The excess probes were washed, and Arf1 or GBF1 was subsequently immunostained with primary and Alexa488-secondary antibodies in PBS/BSA in the absence of detergents.siRNA TransfectionArf1 siRNA was part of the human on-target plus membrane trafficking and remodeling siRNA library (Dharmacon, CO); GBF1, PI4KIII\u03b2 and nontargeting siRNA were purchased separately (QIAGEN,CA). HeLa cells were seeded at 10000/well in a 96-well plate (for the replicon assay) or in 200000/well in a 12-well plate for Western blot analysis to verify knockdown efficiency of proteins one day before siRNA transfection. 50 nM of siRNA were transfected via Dharmafect1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon, CO) and incubated for 48 hr.Cell Viability QuantificationOptimal plasmid expression times, siRNA concentrations, siRNA incubation times and PIK93 concentration and incubation times that maximize cell viability were assessed by both quantifying cell number and by CellTiter-Glo cell viability assays (Promega Corp, WI). Plasmid concentration range tested was 0.1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl-1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl; and siRNA concentration range tested was 25 nM-100 nM.Replicon AssaysThe CVB3 pRib-Rluc, PV pXpA-RenR, and J6/JFH (p7-Rluc2A) plasmids with Renilla luciferase gene as reporters in place of structural genes were utilized to measure viral RNA replication. Plasmids were linearized and in vitro-transcribed and RNA purified with MEGAscript system and MEGAclear Kit respectively (Applied BioSystems/Ambion, TX). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and quality of runoff transcripts were estimated by agarose gels. Replicon RNAs were transfected into HeLa cells grown in 96-well white plates with flat bottom (Corning Corp., NY) at 15 ng/well with Trans-it mRNA transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, WI). Incubation media contained 80 \u03bcM live-cell Renilla substrate Endu-Ren (Promega Corp., WI). Renilla light signal was recorded with Biotek HT multi-well plate reader (Biotek, VT) at 15 min intervals up to 16 hr at 37\u00b0C.PI4P Lipid Extraction and QuantificationCells were harvested, and PI4P lipids were extracted in cold 0.5M of Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with 3 ml of 5% TCA/1 mM EDTA solution and pellets were suspended in 3 ml of methanol:chloroform (2:1) solution, incubated at room temperature for ten minutes and subjected to centrifugation. To obtain phosphatidylinositol lipids, the 2.25 ml of methanol: chloroform: 12N hydrochloric acid solution (80:40:1) was added to pellets followed by fifteen minutes incubation at room temperature. Supernatant was mixed with 0.75 ml of chloroform before adding 1.35 ml of 0.1N hydrochloric acid to generate organic and aqueous phases. The organic phase containing the phosphatidylinositide was dried in a vacuum dryer, and subjected to PI4P quantification by protein lipid overlay assay (Echelon Biosciences, UT). PI4P samples from different post-infection time points were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane strips and blocked with 3% BSA 0.1% tween-20 PBS solution for 1 hr to remove non-specific binding. PI4P lipids were detected by PI4P detectors derived from FAPP1 proteins (Dowler et al., 2002) followed by secondary and tertiary antibody incubation. The signal was visualized by SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, IL). The concentration of PI4P was determined by correlating the intensity of samples to a standard curve generated from known concentrations of PI4P.RNA Polymerase Lipid-Binding AssayRecombinant PV polymerase (3Dpol) in pET26Ub-3D was purified as described (Gohara et al., 1999). Lipid dot-blot strips (PIP micro Strips and membrane lipid Strips) were purchased (Echelon Biosciences, UT). The nitrocellulose lipid blots were incubated in blocking buffer [3% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA fraction V (EMD, NJ) in TBST-50 (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20 at pH 7.4)] for 1 hr at RT and then incubated in the same buffer with purified PV 3Dpol overnight at 4\u00b0C. The lipid blots were then washed in TBST-50 (5 times, 10 min each). To detect lipid protein interactions, strips were then incubated with an anti-3Dpol antibody (1:5000 in blocking buffer) for 1 hr at RT. Blots were washed as before and incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10000 in blocking buffer) (Pierce, IL) for 1 hr at RT. 3Dpol bound to the lipids immobilized on the membrane were visualized by incubating with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, IL). To ensure lipid-binding specificity, several different concentrations of a protein in range from 1 to 4 \u03bcg/ml were tested. The lowest concentration giving specific binding and a detectable signal on a western blot was chosen for the lipid dot-blot experiments. Control experiments included parallel blots using no 3Dpol protein and no lipid spotted membranes.ImmunoprecipitationInfected (CVB3; 4 hr) and noninfected HeLa cells were scraped and suspended in hypotonic buffer (50 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). Suspended sells were broken up using cell homogenizer (Isobiotec, Germany) to preserve the replication organelle membranes. The nucleus and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant cell lysates were incubated with 1ug of monoclonal PI4KIII\u03b2 antibody (Millipore Corp., MA) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Protein A/G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs, MA) were added and incubated at 4\u00b0C for additional 2 hr. The pull down fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which are then blocked with 5% Nonfat Milk (3A, 3AB, 3C, 3CD blot) or 5%FCS 1%BSA (PI4KIII\u03b2 blot) in TBST solution (10 mM Tris pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%Tween20), incubated anti-3A, anti-3Dpol or anti-PI4KIII\u03b2 antibody and washed 5 times with TBST before incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bound antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence.Pearson Correlation Coefficient CalculationsWe statistically assessed the degree of colocalization between two components using a classical Pearson correlation coefficient for the image intensity in the red and green channels using the following formulae (Bolte and Cordelieres 2006):r=\u2211XY\u2212\u2211X\u2211YN(\u2211X2\u2212(\u2211X)2N)(\u2211Y2\u2212(\u2211Y)2N)\n\n",

Recruited PI4KIII\u03b2 will catalyze the production of a PI4P lipid microenvironment (red lipids) that will in turn facilitate the recruitment of 3Dpol from the cytosolic pool to the membrane and promote the synthesis of viral RNA. (B) Uninfected (0 hr): Steady-state exchange of membranes, Golgi enzymes, and cargo through bidirectional trafficking between the ERGIC and Golgi/TGN compartments. Golgi enzymes and cargo are sorted out of Sar1/COPII-labeled ER exit sites into ERGIC compartments whereupon GBF1/Arf1 and COPI coats mediate the trafficking to and from the Golgi/TGN compartments. PI4KIII\u03b2 enzymes are recruited to Golgi/TGN membranes by Arf1 and catalyze the production of PI4P lipids at these membranes. 2 hr: Upon infection, newly synthesized viral replication enzymes such as the membrane-bound 3A target to and assemble on secretory organelle membranes but concentrate and initiate viral RNA synthesis on the Golgi/TGN membranes, where the pre-existing (i.e., prior to infection) steady-state pool of PI4P lipids facilitates viral replication protein assembly and RNA replication. Rising levels of 3A combined with its modulation of effector recruitment by GBF1/Arf1 will enhance the recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 over COPI, leading to a decreased rate of anterograde transport out of the ERGIC and subsequent disassembly of the Golgi/TGN organelles. 4 hr: Enhanced recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 over COPI results in the formation of uncoated PI4P lipid-enriched organelles adjacent to ER exit sites. The PI4P lipid-enriched microenvironment of these organelles facilitates the ongoing assembly of newly synthesized viral replication proteins such as RdRp 3Dpol and viral RNA replication.",
