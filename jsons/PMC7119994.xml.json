A particularly fruitful area for development has been the dynamics of acute immunizing infections, with their relatively simple natural history and rich notification time series [2\u20134]. The last three decades have seen a considerable upsurge in the use of mathematical and computational models to explore the dynamics and control of a wide range of viral infections. This phase arose initially from developments in ecological population dynamics [4]; it was then greatly accelerated, both by the explosion in computational power and by the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other potential pandemic threats [5].",

            "text": "The basic SIR formulation embodies the dynamics of immunizing infections. Because viruses reproduce rapidly in the host, we ignore within-host kinetics in the simplest SIR models (but see Sect. 8); depending on model details, this leads to a compartmentalization of the host population between (as yet uninfected) susceptible individuals, infected, recovered, and other classes. An initial taxonomic split here is between the SIR model (which crudely assumes that all infected individuals can pass on infection) and the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model, which adds an \u201cexposed\u201d (infected but not yet infectious) class [4]. SIR and SEIR models have qualitatively very similar dynamics [13]; however, we describe the latter with its more realistic depiction of viral incubation. The basic SEIR model, illustrated in Fig. 5.1b, reflects the following set of biological assumptions; we use measles as the classic acute exemplar here [14]. After a few months of maternally derived passive immunity, infants enter the virus-na\u00efve \u201csusceptible\u201d (S) class; susceptibles can then become infected by close contact with infectious individuals (generally via respiratory aerosol for measles). Infection moves individuals into the \u201cexposed\u201d (E) class, where they incubate but do not transmit the infection for around a week; this leads to the infectious (I) class, where virus is shed, again for approximately a week, after which individuals enter the recovered state (R). In the basic SEIR model, recovered individuals are assumed to be immune for life, both to clinical disease and to retransmitting the infection. However, subclinical infection (and hence boosting of immunity [15, 16]) is in principle possible. The lifelong sterilizing immunity induced by such an infection also makes this an excellent potential vaccine candidate [4]. For the SEIR model, vaccination is at its simplest assumed to be delivered to a proportion p of infants at the end of the maternal immunity period (i.e., near the effective \u201cbirth\u201d of susceptibles). For individuals who seroconvert, immunity is then often assumed to be lifelong, moving susceptibles into the recovered class (Fig. 5.1c). There is also a considerable literature exploring more operationally realistic age distributions and immunogenic characteristics of vaccines in specific cases [5, 17].",

The talismanic quantity here is the basic reproduction number (or ratio) of infection, R\n0 [4, 5]. At its simplest, R\n0 is defined as the total number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual when introduced into a well-mixed fully susceptible population. To illustrate the ensuing dynamics, consider an epidemic of infection with R\n0 > 0. Since each case initially causes R\n0 secondary infections, the epidemic increases more or less exponentially over the first few infectious generations (Fig. 5.1c). However, these dynamics rapidly deplete the susceptible pool. This brings us to the other key parameter of epidemic spread: the effective reproduction number, defined as R = [S/N]R\n0. Here, S/N is the proportion of susceptibles in the population and R is the realized value of R\n0 as the epidemic develops [4]. Since S declines over the course of the epidemic (Fig. 5.1c), so does R (Fig. 5.1d).",

Eventually, the effective reproduction ratio declines through unity (Fig. 5.1c) as population immunity increases; this corresponds to the herd immunity threshold, above which the epidemic will always decline, even if reintroduced to a closed population. This threshold is thus also a key aim of vaccination campaigns [4, 5]. Remembering that R = [S/N]R\n0, the associated susceptible proportion at the herd immunity threshold (R = 1) becomes s\nc = 1/R\n0 (Fig. 5.1c); thus, immunizing at a level above p\nc = 1 \u2212 s\nc = 1 \u2212 1/R\n0 will eliminate local transmission. As described below, these calculations have been refined considerably to allow for heterogeneities in transmission with age, space, and other characteristics (Sects. 3, 4, and 5). Nonetheless, our simple expression for p\nc is an extremely useful metaphor for epidemic control: (1) because of indirect protection, not everyone needs to be vaccinated to eliminate transmission (corresponding to p\nc < 1) and (2) the effort required to increase this level of immunization increases with transmission rates. The latter point is made clear by a simple plot of p\nc against R\n0 (Fig. 5.2); more transmissible immunizing infections such as measles are harder to control than less transmissible agents such as smallpox. However, this refers to \u201crandom\u201d mass vaccination; more targeted strategies such as ring vaccination coupled to active surveillance can promote elimination even below p\nc, given (as with smallpox elimination [19]) the right biological characteristics and logistics. Partial immunity and other characteristics of the population can complicate the picture still further (see Sect. 5.2 below). Nonetheless, the metaphor that more transmissibility necessitates a stronger vaccination effort remains.\n\n",

The question of what maintains the recurrent epidemics [9] generally observed for immunizing childhood infections (e.g., Fig. 5.1) drove researchers to seek the key aspect of biological realism missing from the simplest SEIR model. For measles in England and Wales, seasonal variation in transmission driven by increased contact rates of children when schools were in session rapidly emerged as a possible candidate [12, 21] and has since received considerable empirical support [2, 3]. Stochastic fluctuations in incidence could in principle also contribute to the maintenance of cycles [22, 23]; however, for measles, the predominant driver is seasonality in transmission [2, 3]. Birth rate may modulate the periodicity of recurrent cycles driven by seasonality through its role in determining the rate of susceptible replenishment [24]. For example, for most of the postwar pre-vaccination era in London, seasonality generated sustained cycles by resonating with the biennial epidemic tendency of measles dynamics. However, during the postwar baby boom, births achieved sufficient levels to shift measles dynamics into annual cycles (Fig. 5.4).\n\n\n",

Contexts with both high and low birth rates (and both high and low transmission since birth rates and transmission act dynamically in very similar ways for immunizing infections [24]) can promote complex dynamics via coexisting attractors. Until recently, it was thought that chaotic measles dynamics were not likely to be observed [3, 25], since observed seasonality in transmission was not strong enough to drive the associated violent epidemics. However, recent analyses of measles in Niger revealed very strong seasonality (driven by movement in and out of cities linked to rainfall); this, combined with high transmission rates and the highest birth rate in the world, results in irregular outbreaks consistent with expectations of chaos (Fig. 5.5). Erratic boom and bust outbreaks are expected to continue even as routine vaccination improves; and this suggests that high investment in reactive vaccination and surveillance is important, and pulsed vaccination approaches such as supplementary immunization activities could also play a helpful role in synchronizing dynamics [26].\n\n",

Intuitively, this occurs because the faster an immunizing virus is spreading through a population, the younger the age at which individuals are likely to be exposed to it. Host demography modulates this relationship, and higher birth rate countries with an R\n0 equivalent to that in lower birth rate countries will tend to have a lower average age of infection [27]. Maternal immunity, or protection of children after birth by transfer of maternal antibodies, will also have an impact, increasing the average age of infection for children whose mothers have been exposed to infection. Since maternal antibodies rarely persist for much more than a year, this effect will be greatest for infections with very low average ages of infection [4]. Beyond these broad descriptors, however, there is the added complication of possible relationships between age and probability of exposure to infection. Such relationships may arise for a variety of reasons. For example, only individuals beyond a certain age may work in areas where the disease is transmitted, or the disease may be only sexually transmitted. As a result, the force of infection, or probability that a susceptible individual will be infected, will show a distinct relationship with age.",

There are two approaches to estimating this variation. The first is to use age profiles of seropositivity to infer the pattern of the force of infection and, from this, extrapolate to the pattern of contacts over age [28\u201331]. The link between these age profiles and the force of infection over age can be made since once an individual has been infected, she/he can never be infected again. Therefore, to be immune at any age, the individual must have contracted the infection prior to that age. On a population level, cross-sectional seropositivity thus provides an indication of the total risk of infection for individuals up to a given age.

Bartlett demonstrated the existence of a CCS of around 300,000\u2013500,000 for measles in England and Wales. For measles to persist in locations with a population size smaller than this CCS, immigration of infected immigrants from elsewhere in the metapopulation is necessary. The result is that the spread of measles across England and Wales in the pre-vaccine era resembled traveling waves spreading out from London [6], with a substantial epidemic lag in locations further away. The duration of the lag was also shaped by the size of the local populations. The duration of fade-outs following local extinction contains information on the degree to which a particular location is connected to the metapopulation as a whole [42]. Generally, this points to larger places being more connected. More detailed parametric analyses tend to confirm this (e.g., the gravity model [43]).",

As infectious period increases, we therefore see a transition from seasonally driven biennial epidemics (at the measles extreme of a 1-week infectious period) to low-amplitude annual epidemics (at 1 month). For longer infectious periods (1 year), we see slowly evolving epidemics with little seasonal activity and a modest post-epidemic overshoot. Finally, for a 10-year infectious period, we see a smooth slow epidemic, with an essentially \u201clogistic\u201d rise to a stable endemic plateau of incidence.

Vaccination aims to lower R through reducing the number susceptible in the population; however, evolving pathogens introduce the complexity of countering this effect, by evading immunity and thus acting to restore R. Note the combination of immune escape and transmissibility encapsulated in R. In particular, on the scale of the host population and with a given level of existing immunity, the escape mutant with the greatest evolutionary fitness is that which maximizes R [5].",

Another potential immune escape strategy [77] is glycosylation, or the attachment of oligosaccharides to the HA molecule, to occlude epitopes from antibody binding.

It builds on the proposal by Kimura in 1968 [84] that many amino acid substitutions in nature do not alter evolutionary fitness and are thus phenotypically neutral. If influenza HA evolution can be thought of as tracing a series of paths through a space of genotypes, the epochal evolution model proposes that, in phenotypic terms, such a space has a modular structure (Fig. 5.9b) in which each \u201cmodule\u201d is a group of genotypes sharing the same antigenic phenotype and a transition between modules corresponds to the observed antigenic \u201cjumps.\u201d In particular, HA evolution diffuses through the local genotype space, accumulating neutral substitutions and thus genotypic diversity, over several years. Ultimately, a single strain accumulates the substitutions required to transition to a new antigenic phenotype. At this point, the emergent strain \u2013 owing to its antigenic novelty \u2013 causes a peak in infection and undergoes a selective sweep in the host population, to the exclusion of other strains. Such an event thus acts to periodically control antigenic diversity, maintaining the \u201ctrunk-like\u201d shape of the influenza phylogeny.",

Both within and between virus species, some variants may barely affect hosts at all, while others have significant health impacts, up to and including host mortality [86]. An evolutionary perspective indicates that variation in virulence across clones should be shaped by the costs and benefits of virulence for parasite transmission [87]. The spread and persistence of virulence mutations may be favored if they covary with transmission. However, since host mortality can interrupt transmission, a range of values of virulence may lead to equivalent levels of overall fitness for the parasite [88]. While it is broadly agreed that the theoretical framework and empirical evidence on the existence of virulence-transmission trade-offs need to be further developed and extended [87], there are some systems where the general predictions appear to be borne out (e.g., [89, 90]). Perhaps most famously, the introduction of the myxoma virus into Australia was at first devastating to rabbit populations, causing near 100 % mortality. However, over subsequent years, the virulence of the infection decreased. Various lines of evidence suggest that this occurred in response to selection for increased transmission via decreased virulence \u2013 swift rabbit mortality was not an efficient mode of transmission for the virus.",

Major advances in the 1990s showed that despite the long clinical timescale involved, in vivo HIV replication is in fact a rapid process, with the viral life cycle being on the order of days [95, 96]. Subsequent studies modeling the dynamics of drug resistance underlined the need for early and aggressive drug therapy [97].

Bernoulli\u2019s work provides perhaps the earliest case study [1]; recent high-profile examples include the use of models to guide responses to foot and mouth disease in the UK [111], smallpox [112], and influenza [113]. The key criterion of the effective deployment of models for policy is that they are embedded in testable hypotheses, embodying the best possible science. Continuing progress in this area thus calls for better understanding of the basic principles.",

A key task at the heart of this challenge is arguably to quantify transmission potential in terms of immune escape, that is, to measure empirically how changes at the molecular level impact R (see Sect. 6.1). Indeed, recent equine influenza experiments provide some important steps in this direction [114].",

To name three examples, while disease surveillance continues to operate largely through public health channels, there is increasing interest in the use of alternative sources, including automated tracking of Internet and social media trends [115, 116]. Second, genetic sequencing and analysis complements existing epidemiological approaches. The advent of high-throughput whole-genome sequencing is expected to shed new light on within-host viral diversity [117], an important aspect in our understanding of viral evolution. Third, any viral infection leaves its mark on the host immune system. Serological studies thus offer another valuable source of information in monitoring diseases [32] and already play an important role in many national surveillance programs (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_4). While in some cases there remain challenges in the clinical interpretation of quantitative serological data (e.g., Ref. [118]), its future use in estimating, for example, the prevalence of subclinical, but infectious, cases could be of significant value to public health efforts [119\u2013121].",
