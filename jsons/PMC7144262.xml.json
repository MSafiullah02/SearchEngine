            "text": "The number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasing dramatically throughout the world [1], and in Italy [2, 3], particularly in the northern region of Lombardy [4]. Regional Italian medical and political authorities have implemented extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus. This disease may cause massive diffuse alveolar damage resulting in acute respiratory failure (ARF) that requires, in a high percentage of cases, mechanical ventilation [5\u20138]. Based on our general experience so far in dealing with the disease and on the existing knowledge (albeit still limited and evolving) [5\u20138], Italian respiratory scientific societies proposes here an Early Consensus Statement Management for non-ICU ARF SARS-CoV-2 emergency. It represents the expert opinion of pulmonologists directly involved in the first line of assistance. The Consensus identified two urgent areas for action: a) management, and b) organisation. We carried out a search of the published literature in PubMed, Ovid, Embase databases and relevant websites from the construction of the databases to March 20, 2020 in order to retrieve guidelines and recommendations, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, state of the art papers, and randomised trials. The search terms used were: \u201cCoronavirus pneumonia\u201d, \u201cARDS\u201d, \u201cAcute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\u201d, \u201cSARS\u201d, \u201cMERS\u201d, \u201cInfluenza\u201d, Acute Respiratory Failure or Mechanical Ventilation\u201d, \u201cNoninvasive ventilation AND Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure\u201d. Based on the literature search, a small group of 4 pulmonologists professionals produced a preliminary document, which was then submitted to the consensus group of 10 doctors. Consensus on the final document was achieved through video conference meetings (Conference Call). Using a Delphi-like procedure, we asked the experts to rate the entire document on a 5-point Likert scale (0=totally disagree; 1=disagree; 2=sufficiently agree; 3=moderately agree; 4=totally agree). Consensus was considered when more than 75% of the respondents rated the document as \u201ctotally agree\u201d. In this context the proposed paper is a changeable consensus not necessarily totally in line with the WHO documents because the Italian situation was and unfortunately still is continuously in progression day by day. Below we summarise the recommendations that we consider most appropriate and urgent.",

            "text": "The management-related actions regarded, first, the need to ensure maximum protection of doctors and nurses working in the field (e.g. working at a distance of at least 1 m from the suspected or positive patient). Second, the need to create an epidemiological/clinical assessment protocol (triage) to classify patients based on medical history, geographical origin (i.e. inside or outside the cluster zones), and clinical signs such as fever, persisting cough for more than 48\u201372 h, dyspnea, SaO2<93% when breathing air. Third, the need to develop a diagnostic algorithm to determine which tests to perform when, i.e. pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, chest X-ray or pulmonary high-resolution CT. The proposed triage led to the identification of four patient categories: green (SaO2>94%, RR<20 breaths\u00b7min\u22121); yellow (SaO2<94%, RR>20 but responds to oxygen 10\u201315 L\u00b7min\u22121); orange (SaO2<94%, RR 25\u201330 but poor response to oxygen 10\u201315 L\u00b7min\u22121 and needing continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]/noninvasive ventilation [NIV] with FiO2<50%;red (SaO2<94%, RR>30 but poor response to oxygen 10\u201315 L\u00b7min\u22121, CPAP/NIV with FiO2>50% or presenting respiratory distress with PaO2/FiO2<200 and needing endotracheal intubation [EI] and ICU admission). The actions requested concerned indications for the transfer of suspected or confirmed cases, depending on the local situation, to one of the following: 1) ad-hoc so-called COVID HUB hospitals (i.e. special units inside or outside the hospital dedicated to these patients and developed, on average, within or shortly after the first week from the initial outbreak); 2) infectious disease units, or dedicated areas ready for isolation of confirmed cases and immediate ARF treatment; or 3) ICU for early intubation of compromised patients with low PaO2/FiO2 or patients \u201cnot responding\u201d to oxygen/CPAP/NIV. The Consensus focused on a \u201cwhat to do\u201d management pathway (see flow chart, fig. 1) stressing the need for close patient monitoring, care of comorbidities, fluid and nutritional prescription, sedation if needed, use of aerosol devices if needed, and monitoring for risk of a sudden deterioration of the patient's clinical conditions. It discussed the indications for high-flow oxygen blender, level of FiO2 to guarantee just an SaO2>90%, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) devices, and CPAP/NIV indications as a form of treatment or as ceiling of treatment and palliative care. After extensive discussion, the Consensus set the indication for CPAP between 10 and 12 cmH20, without humidification and with helmet (first choice), for CPAP use with a mask (second choice) and for NIV use with an oronasal face mask (third choice), using high performance ventilators or, if these are lacking, dedicated NIV platforms or home ventilators. Due to the non sufficient number of ICU beds, respiratory intermediate units and negative pressure rooms to provide the respiratory support to all the patients, Consensus proposed Emergency Room, medical wards, dedicated units and surgical rooms had to be transformed in locations to provide any form of mechanical ventilationin rooms with possibility of air exchange (big windows to open periodicallyachieving a change of air of at least 160 L\u00b7h\u22121, as recommended). Clearly when all these environments are unavailable, CPAP/NIV is indicated using the maximum available personnel protection. Indications when to stop CPAP/NIV in case of worsening did not reach a consensus amongst the audit group, nor did standardised indications for when to perform intubation, as this depends on the number of beds of the referral ICU and their actual occupancy. Obviously, the group suggested a regular decontamination of the ventilator and devices used, at the end of the ventilator treatment. Due to uncertainty around the potential for aerosolization, HFO, NIV, including bubble CPAP, we have further stressed the need for airborne precautions. Consensus stressed also that, in the de novo severe critical patients and in patients failing 2 h of CPAP/NIV, the GOLD standard remains the ICU admission. Otherwise, in a \u201cwar\u201d condition like our with an huge numbers of patients, paucity of ICU beds and ventilators the option of CPAP/NIV administered non invasively remains the unique change. The Consensus was not focused on the role of antiviral, antibiotics, steroids, anticoagulant and others innovative drugs because this topic was not strictly related to the consensus object. Regarding organisation, pulmonologists have been involved in identifying: a) hospitals or hospital areas for isolated suspect patients awaiting confirmation of diagnosis; b) specific \u201ccontaminated\u201d paths, zones and the team involved; c) transferal procedures for patients into negative aeration rooms (when available) or, as second choice, into one-bed rooms or an area with a distance of at least 2 m between patients. The work in these days has led to the creation of isolation areas for patient groups (positive and on EI; positive on NIV/CPAP; positive with respiratory failure on oxygen therapy; negative pending the second pharyngeal swab if the clinic and CT scan suggest bilateral and interstitial pneumonia). The respiratory team has had to manage and co-manage patients with other specialists in the multidisciplinary team with maximal flexibility to find discharge routes to \u201cintermediate\u201d units (such as Internal Medicine, Respiratory Rehabilitation, Social Units) for COVID patients with further need of clinical and infective follow-up. The Consensus agreed to abolish visits by family members to COVID patients, offering once a day a face-to-face contact or a telephone call with one family member only. Since the first days of the crisis, our teams have been involved in sharing ceiling treatment decisions for EI and CPAP/NIV use based on the patient's medical history, age, beds available and numbers of new cases. Finally, all our staff has been strongly exhorted to use adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) according to the WHO document, equipment that, up till now, remains not easy to find due to the huge demand.\n",

We do not know if we are facing something similar to what was experienced by heroic doctors and nurses in the 1950s during the polio epidemic when most hospitals had limited availability of iron lungs for patients unable to breathe independently [9]. On that occasion, makeshift respiratory centers were set up to assist the most severe patients, from which the Intensive Care Unit was born [9]. Our suggestions for our colleagues and health policy makers are: 1) To develop as soon as possible clear and effective measures to protect health workers 2) To increase immediately and maintain in the next future the beds of ICU and dedicated to NIV and critical care patients in respiratory settings 3) To completely rethink the different European health systems considering a wide range of flexibility and the strong need for the development of home care assistance and of new models of hospital organisation 4) To develop a \u201cMarshall plan\u201d to sustain the devastating impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on disability and socio-economic systems.",
