investigate a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak event involving multiple healthcare facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; to characterize transmission; and to explore infection control implications. Design: Outbreak investigation. Setting: Cases presented in 4 healthcare facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: a tertiary-care hospital, a specialty pulmonary hospital, an outpatient clinic, and an outpatient dialysis unit. Methods: Contact tracing and testing were performed following reports of cases at 2 hospitals. Laboratory results were confirmed by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and/or genome sequencing. We assessed exposures and determined seropositivity among available healthcare personnel (HCP) cases and HCP contacts of cases. Results: In total, 48 cases were identified, involving patients, HCP, and family members across 2 hospitals, an outpatient clinic, and a dialysis clinic. At each hospital, transmission was linked to a unique index case. Moreover, 4 cases were associated with superspreading events (any interaction where a case patient transmitted to \u22655 subsequent case patients). All 4 of these patients were severely ill, were initially not recognized as MERS-CoV cases, and subsequently died. Genomic sequences clustered separately, suggesting 2 distinct outbreaks. Overall, 4 (24%) of 17 HCP cases and 3 (3%) of 114 HCP contacts of cases were seropositive. Conclusions: We describe 2 distinct healthcare-associated outbreaks, each initiated by a unique index case and characterized by multiple superspreading events. Delays in recognition and in subsequent implementation of control measures contributed to secondary transmission. Prompt contact tracing, repeated testing, HCP furloughing, and implementation of recommended transmission-based precautions for suspected cases ultimately halted transmission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel \u03b2-coronavirus identified in 2012. 1 Infection may result in upper or lower respiratory tract illness, with symptoms ranging from inapparent or mild to rapidly progressive respiratory failure and, i\u00f1 35% of confirmed cases, death. 2 Numerous large, healthcareassociated outbreaks of MERS-CoV have occurred, resulting in transmission to patients, visitors, and healthcare personnel (HCP).

Transmission from patient cases to HCP participating in aerosolizing procedures prior to airborne precautions was likely, despite taking recommended airborne precautions and wearing appropriate PPE. MERS-CoV has been detected in large quantities in respiratory secretions 25 and live virus isolated from environmental surfaces. 7 It is possible that inappropriate use of PPE (eg, insufficient fit testing) or contamination of PPE and inappropriate doffing resulted in transmission.
