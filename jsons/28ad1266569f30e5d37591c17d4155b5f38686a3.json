Across 24 languages, we find two distinct dynamic regimes: One characterizing the rise and subsequent collapse in collective attention to the initial Coronavirus outbreak in late January, and a second that represents March COVID-19-related discourse. Aggregating countries by dominant language use, we find that volatility in the first dynamic regime is associated with future volatility in new cases of COVID-19 roughly three weeks (average 22.7 \u00b1 2.17 days) later. Our results suggest that surveillance of change in usage of epidemiology-related words on social media may be useful in forecasting later change in disease case numbers, but we emphasize that our current findings are not causal or necessarily predictive.",

Variance of percent changes in word time series closest to the centroid of C 2 is a consistent leading indicator of variance in percent change in new cases of COVID-19.

Words assigned to C 2 describe pandemics in general, while words assigned to C 1 describe quarantines and lockdowns in particular. Though we have not conducted a formal linguistic analysis to conclude that there are significant semantic differences between words assigned to each cluster, these preliminary findings provide evidence that such a semantic difference does exist. to a percent-change based analysis of these data. We analyze percent-change time series for the log word rank closest to E[C 2 ] and the new case time series for each language. We estimate a latent volatility statistic for each percent-change time series. This statistic captures the latent variance of the time series at each point in time without destroying information through computation of a rolling variance. Peaks in the latent volatility statistic indicate days on which the underlying time series exhibited large percentchanges in its value. We measure the distance between (a) the peak latent volatility statistic of percent-change log word rank and (b) the peak latent volatility statistic of percent-change new cases, termed the peak-to-peak distance (P2PD), for each language under study. P2PD is a simple metric of the lag between fluctuations in social media attention to the initial Coronavirus outbreak and (usually positive) large fluctuations in new cases. Mean P2PD is approximately 22.7 days with a estimated SEM of 2.17 days. Moreover, P2PD is greater than zero for all but two languages (Tamil and Portuguese) under study.",
