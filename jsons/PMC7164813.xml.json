We noted that previous studies mainly focused on surveillance of post-travel illness, which was usually based on clinician-based surveillance systems\u2014eg, GeoSentinel, which tracks infectious diseases and other adverse health outcomes related to travel. Several identified studies were about the epidemiological features of imported malaria or about febrile illnesses or HIV infection at one port of China. We did not find any studies of active surveillance for various infections among arriving travellers at all entry\u2013exit ports throughout mainland China.\nAdded value of this study\nTo the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to characterise the spectrum of travel-related infections, and reveals variety in frequency of each infection by traveller type, exposure country or region, and arrival provinces of mainland China in 2014\u201316, representing the pattern of travel-associated infections during travel.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur findings imply that health-care providers should make evidence-based health recommendations to travellers before travel, and do destination-specific medical assessments of arriving travellers when they are ill, based on our estimates of the incidence of infections. Active surveillance at entry ports can identify imported cases with emerging or re-emerging infections to prevent or at least postpone local transmission. In addition to entry surveillance upon arrival, follow-up surveillance (especially contact tracing of highly communicable infections) is needed to better understand the whole profile of travel-related infections. Overall, our findings should help to increase public health awareness about the potential risk of imported infections to mainland China.\n",

Over four-fifths of respiratory infections and about two-thirds of vector-borne and mucocutaneous infections were detected by fever screening (table), suggesting that fever screening is essential to identification of febrile patients.

For example, Chinese citizens who travelled overseas and were diagnosed upon arrival back to mainland China could have acquired the infection before travelling. Thus, the frequency of such infection in arriving travellers could have been overestimated. Although we estimated the overall incidence of each infection, would could not calculate the numerical risk for travellers coming from a particular country or region because of the lack of denominator data.
