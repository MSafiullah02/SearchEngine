Within China, a total of 80,955 cases are confirmed, with 4257 severe cases in mainland China (www.nhc.gov.cn). In severe cases of COVID-19, patients experience rapid disease progression and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2].",

The Chinese government covers all costs to treat patients with the COVID-19 infection, so the cost analysis of ECMO is to date unavailable in mainland China. However, an average ECMO procedure in the USA costs $73,122 USD, indicating that ECMO is a highly resource-demanding procedure [7]. Therefore, a further, larger sample size study and a comprehensive analysis of the medical value of using ECMO on COVID-19 patients are urgently required. Based on the two cohort case series in this study, nearly half of the critically ill COVID-19 patients with ECMO were dying from septic shock and multiple organ failure. As anticipated by MacLaren et al. [3], COVID-19 is a pandemic; all healthcare resources are stretched so that ECMO is not a therapy to be rushed to the frontline. Therefore, interim treatment guidelines [5, 6] of recommending ECMO for critically ill COVID-19 patients should be taken cautiously.",
