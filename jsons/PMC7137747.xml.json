On May 5, 2014, WHO issued strong recommendations that Pakistan, Syria, and Cameroon should ensure that their residents and long-term visitors have up-to-date vaccination against polio before they travel internationally, and that each individual is issued with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis as proof of this.2 The recommendations advise that residents and long-term visitors receive one dose of oral polio vaccine or inactivated poliovirus vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months before international travel, and that those who are undertaking urgent travel have one dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure. These new recommendations from WHO are important and long overdue. They may not be the last intervention of this kind, since WHO plans to reassess the situation in 3 months. The recommendations are associated with a declaration from WHO that the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 is a public health emergency of international concern.2\n",

However, if they\u2014or any other country\u2014does export poliovirus, WHO's primary recommendation for mandatory polio vaccination will also come into force for them.2 This is of great relevance to Nigeria, from where poliovirus has historically caused many outbreaks in other African countries.11\n",
