            "text": "A key role for ACE2 is emerging in the conversion of the octapeptide Ang II to its metabolite angiotensin-(1\u20137) (Ang1\u20137). For example, a compensatory increase in Ang1\u20137 levels in failing human heart ventricles has been correlated with upregulation of ACE2 [5], and cardiac myocyte Ang1\u20137 levels are increased in ischaemic cardiomyopathy [6]. The physiological role of Ang1\u20137 has been controversial but it generally appears to oppose the pressor, proliferative and pro-fibrotic actions of Ang II [7], and acts through its own G-protein-coupled receptor. This would suggest that ACE and ACE2 might act as counterbalances in the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) (Figure 1). The successful production of Ace2 null (Ace2\u2212/\u2212) mice supports this hypothesis [8]. Ace2 knockout mice show major cardiac contractility defects and increased levels of Ang II [8] and, overall, studies in these mice suggest that ACE2 is a key regulator of cardiac function, although the mechanism by which this is mediated is unclear. However, double knockouts, in which both Ace and Ace2 genes have been deleted, do not show the cardiac defects of the Ace2 knockout alone [8], emphasizing the Yin\u2013Yang nature of ACE and ACE2 expression. When Ace2 is transgenically overexpressed in mouse heart, cardiac defects are again observed, most notably a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, which is associated with disruption of gap junction formation [9]. The high incidence of sudden death in these mice correlated with the levels of Ace2 transgene expression. Surviving older mice showed a spontaneous downregulation of the transgene and restoration of normal cardiac function. There are also indirect associations of Ace2 expression with hypertension. In particular, Crackower et al.\n[8] noted that, in the rat, the Ace2 gene maps to a defined quantitative trait locus associated with hypertension and, additionally, two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Ace2 gene locus have been associated with human cardiovascular disease [10]. Another disease model in which ACE2 expression has recently been studied is diabetes. In streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat, expression of renal tubule ACE2 mRNA and protein was substantially reduced whereas an increase in ACE2 protein expression was seen in the diabetic glomeruli [11]. The significance of these changes, and the underlying mechanisms involved, remain to be elucidated. Clearly, searches for possible correlations of ACE2 mRNA and protein over- or under-expression with human cardiovascular and renal disease are warranted to determine whether these correlations mirror the effects observed in rodent models. Several potent and relatively selective inhibitors of ACE2 have been described 12, 13, and the modelling of the active site of ACE2 [14], based on the recently reported structure of human ACE [15], will facilitate the development of new classes of specific inhibitors. The active site model also provides an explanation for the differences in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity between ACE and ACE2 [14].",

The death rate following infection approached almost 10%. Almost as mysteriously as it appeared, perhaps as a result of public health measures, the disease faded away only to re-emerge in China this year. The speed with which the infection spread and the severity of the symptoms led to a massive effort to identify the agent responsible. Within months it had been identified as a positive strand RNA virus, classified as a member of the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV); its genome was sequenced 16, 17 and the search was underway to identify the cellular receptor for the virus. As with other coronaviruses, it is the N-terminal portion (S1 domain) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein that mediates the initial high-affinity binding to a receptor on the surface of susceptible cells. The spike sits in the viral envelope and projects outwards to give a \u2018corona\u2019-like appearance to the virus, hence its name. The replication strategy of the virus is summarized in Figure 2\n, and Figure 3\ndepicts the coronavirus-infected cell.",

            "text": "Michael Farzan and colleagues [18] demonstrated that the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein bound to the African Green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6, which is permissive for viral replication. They were then able to co-immunoprecipitate the protein responsible for viral binding and entry. This SARS-CoV receptor, a glycoprotein of Mr 110 000, was identified by mass spectrometry as ACE2. Its identity was confirmed by showing that, when ACE2 was overexpressed in human cells non-permissive for viral infection, SARS-CoV entry and replication were facilitated; this process was blocked by an ACE2 antibody [18]. The tissue distribution of ACE2 also appears to show some correlation with the sites of SARS-CoV infection and disease pathology. Independently, Xiao et al.\n[19] confirmed that ACE2 was a SARS-CoV receptor and showed that the receptor-binding domain was probably located between residues 272 and 537 of the spike glycoprotein. Farzan's group [20] has now established the recognition region within a 193 amino acid sequence (residues 318\u2013510) and smaller fragments were unable to bind ACE2. A crucial aspartic acid in this region was essential for binding with ACE2. Modelling of the ACE2 structure based on the known structure of ACE has provided another approach to predicting potential binding contacts between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein [21] but ultimately experimental studies are essential to identify the nature of the interactions between these two proteins. The recent solution of the structure of ACE2 [22], which supports much of the earlier modelling of the active site of the enzyme [14], should facilitate studies of ACE2 and S protein interactions. Two unexpected features of ACE2 inhibitor binding arise from the structural studies [22]. First, inhibitor binding induced a large conformational change in the enzyme that aligns crucial residues for catalysis. Second, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in an inverse orientation from that predicted from the binding of the ACEI lisinopril to the active site of ACE [22].",

Again, with this receptor, its distribution can be correlated with sites of infection. However, apart from the zinc-binding region, APN and ACE2 bear no discernible sequence homology and show a different membrane topology. Several features probably facilitate the usurping of plasma membrane peptidases as viral receptors. They exist as ectoenzymes in which the bulk of the protein, including the catalytic domain, faces the extracellular space, and they are heavily glycosylated. They are also abundantly expressed on certain cell types: for example, APN constitutes >5% of the membrane protein of the kidney brush border. The catalytic domain itself is not responsible for coronaviral interaction in either ACE2 or APN because mutations of key active site residues do not affect viral infection. This probably reflects the fact that the catalytic site of ACE2 is buried deep in a narrow cleft within the protein and is accessible only to the oligopeptide substrates of the enzyme.",

For example, it can hydrolyse (des-Arg9)-bradykinin, which is the endogenous ligand of the bradykinin B1 receptor. In this context, the availability of potent and selective inhibitors of ACE2 12, 13 will provide valuable pharmacological tools for exploring the physiology and pathology of the enzyme. The therapeutic potential of ACE2 inhibitors in cardiovascular-related diseases, however, is questionable given the apparent cardioprotective nature of ACE2 activity; much further study is needed in this area. Indeed, mechanisms for selectively increasing cardiac or renal ACE2 levels might be desirable in some conditions; this will require an understanding of the factors that regulate its tissue-specific expression.",

Effective therapies against SARS are urgently required should further major outbreaks occur. From studies on other coronaviruses, a vaccination approach might be viable, although not without limitations [26]. Hence, soluble ACE2 fragments or ACE2 antibodies might provide alternative anti-viral therapeutic approaches, although the possible side-effects of blocking ACE2 are unknown. Indeed, infection by SARS-CoV might affect ACE2 function adversely, which could in turn contribute to some of the pathology of the disease. Given the ability of viruses to usurp cell-surface peptidases and the prevalence of ACE in respiratory and other tissues, ACE itself might have a role as a receptor for an as yet unidentified virus.",

In the classical renin\u2013angiotensin pathway, the decapeptide Ang I (i.e. Ang1\u201310), derived from angiotensinogen via the action of renin, is converted by ACE to the vasoactive Ang II (Ang1\u20138) through the removal of the C-terminal dipeptide His-Leu 1, 2. There is increasing evidence that Ang1\u20137 can counterbalance some of the actions of Ang II [7], being formed from Ang II by the action of ACE2, or possibly from Ang I by the action of neprilysin (NEP). Although ACE2 can convert Ang I to Ang1\u20139, which can in turn be converted to Ang1\u20137 by ACE or NEP, this pathway is unlikely to occur at significant levels in vivo because the metabolism of Ang I by ACE2 is kinetically unfavourable compared with its conversion of Ang II (G.I. Rice. et al., unpublished) and hence is not shown.",

(a) The SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor on the cell surface. (b) Upon entering the cytoplasm, the virus core particle, which contains the genomic RNA bound to the virus nucleoprotein, is released. (c) The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genomic RNA is translated by host ribosomes to generate the virus replicase polyprotein (green; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other proteins). (d) The replicase attaches to the 3\u2032 end of the input genome and begins (e) replication of a full-length anti-genome and (f) synthesis of negative strand subgenomic RNAs that serve as templates for the synthesis of (g) new genomic RNA and (h) viral subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), respectively. All coronavirus mRNAs have conserved 5\u2032 ends (dark blue box) and are 3\u2032 co-terminal and polyadenylated. There are thought to be eight sgRNAs produced in SARS-CoV infected cells; (i) some of these encode the viral structural proteins (shown here). (j) Release of virus occurs after processing and assembly of virus particles in the Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Although primary replication occurs in the cytoplasm, recent evidence suggests that coronaviruses and related viruses use nuclear factors to facilitate the replication process [27].",
