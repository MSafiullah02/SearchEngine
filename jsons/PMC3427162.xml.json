More importantly, there is even less available data on disease incidence for specific etiologies, which can inform public health policies regarding treatment and prevention.",

Singleplex qRT-PCR for rhinovirus, enterovirus and parechovirus were performed using previously published methodologies [13], [14], [15]. The rhino- and enterovirus assays targeted the 5\u2032 noncoding region of an area of high sequence similarity between human rhinovirus and enterovirus and exhibit some cross-reactivity (S. Oberste, personal communication). Therefore, positive rhinovirus and/or enterovirus qRT-PCR were reported together as rhino/enterovirus positive. For atypical bacteria, multiplex qRT-PCR was performed at KEMRI/CDC laboratories in Nairobi for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and pan-Legionella species using published assays [12], [16].",

Adjusted rates of clinic visitation were calculated accounting for the percentage of all clinic visits made for ARI that went to Lwak Hospital as opposed to other area clinics, as determined from the household visits [3]. Etiology-specific incidence was calculated by applying the proportions of each etiology to the adjusted incidence of ARI (Figure 1). Inpatients were over-represented among ARI patients tested at Lwak Hospital (35% inpatients), compared to ARI patients who visited a health facility in the community (5% inpatients), as determined by the household surveillance. Therefore, the inpatient and outpatient etiologic results from Lwak Hospital for each pathogen were weighted using a 19:1 outpatient:inpatient ratio. After adjusting for the outpatient/inpatient distribution, the pathogen-attributable fraction for each pathogen was applied to adjust the etiology-specific proportions. For those pathogens found to have an OR that included 1.0, no incidences were calculated because the role of the pathogen as a cause of ARI was not supported by our data.",

First, we compared etiologies in inpatient and outpatient settings, whereas most previous adult etiology studies in Africa have focused on severely ill, hospitalized patients [23], [24], [25], [26]. We demonstrated different etiologic predominance for the same broadly defined ARI syndrome based on hospitalization status, with pneumococcus more common among inpatients and influenza viruses and hMPV among outpatients. Second, we enrolled a group of asymptomatic controls. As has been noted elsewhere, a positive result from PCR is not necessarily conclusive as to etiology because of its high analytic sensitivity; PCR may detect small amounts of nucleic acid due to past or asymptomatic infections [27], [28], [29], [30]. By enrolling asymptomatic controls, we were able to calculate a pathogen-attributable risk, which suggested that several viruses commonly found among ARI cases (i.e., rhino/enterovirus and adenovirus), were not associated with illness. Third, because we embedded our etiologic study in ongoing population-based surveillance, we were able to calculate incidence of etiology-specific ARI. The accuracy of our rate calculation was likely improved by adjusting for several factors that are often neglected, namely health-seeking patterns in the population and the attributable fraction of illness for each pathogen. Using the calculated incidence, we estimated that approximately 3% and 2% of adults in Nyanza Province (approximately 4.5 million persons \u22655 years, 2009), where Lwak is located, will have an episode of ARI from influenza viruses and pneumococcus each year, respectively, which translates to approximately 135,000 and 90,000 illnesses, respectively, in the province [31].",

NTS bacteremia commonly presents with respiratory symptoms in children, although its role in causing pneumonia based on lung aspiration studies is doubtful [25], [38].

Coinfection could represent a true biologic phenomenon where infectious cofactors are necessary for pathogenesis. Alternatively, the frequency of coinfection could reflect the fact that certain pathogens, such as rhino/enteroviruses and adenoviruses, are commonly detected in the upper airways, with unclear clinical significance. Of note, ARI patients with influenza viruses detected had less coinfection, which might be related to the high pathogen attributable risk of influenza viruses and the lack of need for a coinfection to cause illness.",

Lung aspirates have been shown to have high diagnostic yield in African children, and one study in African adults, as they sample material directly from the affected sections of the lung [25], [50], [51]. However, lung aspirates are rarely performed in African adults with pneumonia due to the potential risk of pneumothorax in populations with high risk of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage has been used in a few hospitals in Africa, and has improved diagnostic yield, although its use is usually reserved for severely ill, hypoxic patients in tertiary hospital settings [23], [25], [26], [34], [36]. While good-quality sputum specimens might have a role in diagnosis of some etiologies, if strict criteria for assigning a predominant organism are used, sputum is generally considered too prone to contamination with upper respiratory tract secretions to be useful diagnostically [30], [37], [52], [53]. Lack of these additional specimens limited our detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci and Mycobacteria tuberculosis, two important causes of severe respiratory infection in high HIV prevalence populations in Africa [23], [25], [26], [34], [36], [54], [55], [56]. Moreover, we did not test for some viruses, such as coronaviruses and bocavirus, which might play a role in pneumonia, although their pathogenicity, particularly in adults, is still debated [11], [34], [57], [58].",

There could be several explanations for this. Malaria infection could augment the risk for ARI. An association between malaria and bacteremia in African children has been shown, although no direct associations between malaria and pneumonia in children or adults has been proven [59]. Second, similar climactic conditions could favor both malaria and pneumonia. We have shown previously that influenza incidence tends to be highest in Kenya during a broad wave that mostly corresponds with the southern hemisphere winter, from June to October, a time period that also encompasses peak malaria season [5], [22]. Lastly, malaria might cause symptoms that meet the nonspecific ARI case definition we used. The overlap in symptoms between malaria and pneumonia in children is well-documented [60]. Although similar evidence does not exist for older persons, the non-specificity of the ARI definition we used suggests that symptomatic malaria could have resulted in an illness that met the ARI case definition.",

            "text": "Our study had several other limitations. First, not all ARI patients were sampled. Reasons for not collecting swabs included high patient volume, after hours clinic attendance, and rare refusals (<10%). While we showed similar demographic characteristics and case-fatality ratios between sampled and non-sampled patients, undetected sampling bias might still have occurred that could influence the pathogens detected. Second, we used a broad ARI definition that likely captured a range of illnesses from influenza-like illness to pneumonia. Without further diagnostic procedures, such as chest radiographs, we could not confirm the anatomic location of the respiratory infection. Third, although the controls were by definition asymptomatic in the two weeks prior to enrollment, they might have been in the incubation period of a viral infection and subsequently developed symptoms. If this were true, a small number of controls might have been inaccurately classified. Fourth, unlike in developed countries, we found lower rates of ARI among the elderly, which we speculate is due to lower healthcare utilization by the elderly in rural Kenya [3], [61], [62]. Fifth, we assumed that a person\u2019s HIV status during home-based testing in 2008 was unchanged throughout the study period, which might have led to some misclassification of HIV status. However, we feel that the number of misclassified individuals is small because the annual incidence of HIV among adults in the area has been estimated at 1% (KEMRI/CDC unpublished data), which at the most would have resulted in 39 individuals among the 1,291 ARI patients with HIV results having misclassified HIV status for some period of the three year surveillance period. Lastly, despite the lack of a statistical association with ARI at the population level for some viruses, an etiologic role of a virus detected in any given individual case cannot be ruled out. A study in Thailand showed that rhinovirus was associated with hospitalized respiratory illness among adults, particularly among the elderly [63]. Outbreaks of rhinovirus-associated pneumonia have been suspected among the elderly in developed countries [64]. Adenovirus has on occasion been implicated as a cause of pneumonia in African adults, but without a control group for comparison [65].",

The high incidence among HIV-infected persons suggests that expanded testing and access to cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and anti-retroviral drugs will likely decrease the number of ARI cases, as has been shown before for pneumococcal infections [66], [67]. Vaccines could also decrease the incidence. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced for infants in Kenya in early 2010 and if herd immunity occurs, as it has in developed countries, then decreases in adult pneumococcal disease incidence are expected [68]. Moreover, targeted vaccination among high-risk groups, such as HIV-infected adults, might be applicable for both influenza and pneumococcus [22], [32].",
