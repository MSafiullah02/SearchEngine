Six genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS) were similar to viruses previously identified in triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses in North American pigs.2 The remaining two genes (NA and M) were derived from Eurasian swine influenza viruses and this particular gene constellation has never been previously identified in humans or other reservoirs.2\n",

The oligonucleotide primers and probe (TIB-MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany) for the both the H1N1 swl and the universal influenza A rtRT-PCR assays are outlined in Table 1. Both assays used the primers at a final concentration of 400 nM and the probe at 200 nM in a 15 \u03bcl or 25 \u03bcl reaction volume. One-step rtRT-PCR was performed on 6 \u03bcl or 5 \u03bcl of RNA extract with the Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) on an ABI Prism 7500 SDS real-time platform (Applied Biosystems). The following thermal profile was used: a single cycle of reverse transcription for 15 min at 50 \u00b0C, 2 min at 95 \u00b0C for reverse transcriptase inactivation and DNA polymerase activation followed by 40 amplification cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 34 min at 60 \u00b0C each (annealing-extension step).

Of these, four were subtyped as seasonal influenza A (3 subtype H3 and 1 subtype H1) whereas three were untypeable. Using the new assay these were found to be H1N1 swl positive and also had a broad range of viral loads as evidenced by the Ct range (samples 16\u201318 in Table 4; Genbank accession numbers: GQ169710 and GQ214167). The final comparison assessed both the H1N1 swl matrix assay and the H1N1 swl H1 specific assay on 52 clinical samples tested positive for influenza A using the universal matrix test (Table 5\n). All samples were submitted to the WOSSVC during the first week of June, 2009. Of these, all 52 typed as being H1N1 swl using the matrix assay. In total, 6 of the 52 samples failed to be detected by the H1N1 swl H1 specific assay. All of these samples had Ct values >35 in the universal influenza and the H1N1 swl matrix assays.",

            "text": "The H1N1 swl matrix assay did not cross react with seasonal influenza A strains currently circulating (subtypes H1N1 and H3N2), swine influenza A (H1N1) or other commonly encountered respiratory pathogens. However, we did observe that the H1N1 swl matrix test detected influenza A, subtype H5N1 which probably due to avian ancestry of the Eurasian M gene in H1N1 swl. Other studies have also highlighted its non-specificity in relation to avian strains of influenza A7. However, since avian influenza A viruses are not circulating in humans in the UK at present the non-specificity of this assay should not pose a particular problem for its routine use and any samples that have a high risk of being avian influenza positive should also be tested using a H5N1 real-time assay in order to rule out this virus. The sensitivity of the H1N1 swl matrix assay is comparable to the frontline universal influenza A rtRT-PCR test in routine use at both Dublin and Glasgow. When testing the dilution series of a clinical sample, both these assays were found to be \u223c2 logs more sensitive than the H1N1 swl H1 specific rtRT-PCR assay. The lower sensitivity of the H1N1 swl H1 specific assay was confirmed when it was compared to the H1N1 swl matrix assay on the 52 untyped influenza A positive clinical samples. Based on the results shown here, both the universal and the H1N1 swl matrix assay are sensitive assays that are of great use in the detection and typing of H1N1 swl. After implementation the assay was used to detect 14 cases of H1N1 swl and all were confirmed as being H1N1 swl by other methods/specialist centres.",

This enabled both Glasgow and Dublin to implement the assay within days of the first UK case being detected. Its use greatly enhanced the public health response to the emergence of H1N1 swl in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland as we were able to rapidly screen samples from patients with suspected travel-associated H1N1 swl. As a result those with infection could be identified quickly and public health interventions implemented to minimise the risk of potential spread. The test was also useful for screening the contacts of these cases and played an important role in detecting the transmission of H1N1 swl from either the index cases and from contact to contact.",
