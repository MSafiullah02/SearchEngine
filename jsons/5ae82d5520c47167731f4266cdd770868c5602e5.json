Methods: This study examined the medical records of all 61 adults admitted to a metropolitan Australian hospital with an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis in a calendar year. Results: Baseline characteristics include: mean (SD) age of participants was 66 (14) years; 56% were women and 42% were current or ex-smokers.

Bronchodilator reversibility was present in 17% and small airway reversibility in 41%.

The clinical course of cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis has been widely studied. However, less is known regarding non-CF bronchiectasis. Clinically characterized by symptoms of productive cough and recurrent chest infections, and pathologically and radiologically by inflamed and dilated airways, 1 bronchiectasis often results in prolonged hospital admissions, frequent antibiotic treatment, impaired quality of life and reduced lung function. 2 Repeated exacerbations, specifically three or more in 1 year, are associated with higher mortality the following year. 3 Populations identified as being at greatest risk of developing bronchiectasis include: indigenous groups, socio-economically deprived persons, individuals suffering with co-morbidities 4 and individuals with moderate (50% < forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) < 70%) or severe (FEV 1 < 50%) COPD. 5 These patients often have increased rates of bronchial infections 5, 6 and increased mortality. 5, 7 Reduced lung function alone, independent of smoking history, has also been associated with increased mortality in bronchiectasis. 3 It is well documented in the literature that COPDrelated bronchiectasis is associated with more severe disease 7, 8 as is rheumatoid arthritis-related disease. 8, 9 More recently, the existence of asthma has been associated with an independent increase in risk of bronchiectasis exacerbations. 9, 10 Characteristics of sputum colonization and chronic infection in bronchiectasis exacerbations are a growing area of interest. The two most common pathogens isolated are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 11, 12 Chronic infection with P. aeruginosa is associated with a threefold increased risk of death, a higher rate of hospital admission, greater exacerbations and lower FEV 1 , compared with H. influenzae. 12, 13 Since the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) in the identification and diagnosis of bronchiectasis, there has been increasing global interest in phenotyping patients with bronchiectasis.
