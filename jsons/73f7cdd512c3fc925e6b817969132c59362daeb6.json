Most cases had links to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and presented with symptoms such as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, difficulty breathing in a few cases, and chest radiograph findings of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (WHO, 2020b). The market was suspected to be the origin of the outbreak and was shut down on 1 January 2020 (Xinhua, 2020a). After the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified the infectious agent as a new type of coronavirus, which WHO subsequently referred to the ensuing viral disease as COVID-19, on 11 February 2020 (WHO, 2020c), China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 on 12 January 2020 (WHO, 2020d). On 11 January 2020, China reported the first COVID-19 death (Bangkok Post, 2020a). On 13 January 2020, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Thailand reported the first imported case of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China which was also the first case outside China (DDC, MoPH, 2020a). China decided to temporarily lock down its public transport and railway stations including outbound passengers to cut off the virus spread beyond Wuhan (Xinhua, 2020b).On 30 January 2020, WHO declared that the outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the significant increase in the number of An evaluation version of novaPDF was used to create this PDF file.

The questionnaire contained nine questions about the capacities of communication with a focus on international responses. All questions were focused on the exchange of information with international organizations, an overview of all available information posted for the public, and the designation of spokespersons at the international level. A meeting among the designated officers from the international cooperation sector, the international health regulation sector, and the incident commander from the Emergency Operations Center was held to identify a consensus in the responses for the questionnaire checklist. The initial responses from 4 to 31 January 2020 were discussed among the officers. A full score of 1 was awarded per question if there was any evidence of the official documents such as a formal letter, an electronic formal letter or minutes from formal meetings. A score of 0.5 was given if there was unofficial documented evidence including an email, video conference, or minutes from informal meetings. A score of zero meant there was a lack of responses or incomplete capacities. Data management and all analyses were performed using Epi Info version 7.2.2.2. Scoring of the capacities of communication was treated as a continuous variable.

Thailand began screening passengers by checking their temperatures upon arrival from Wuhan starting on 3 January 2020 at the Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Phuket, and Chiang Mai international airports. On 13 January 2020, MOPH, Thailand reported the first imported case of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The case was a 61 year-old Chinese woman living in Wuhan City (DDC, MoPH, 2020). On 22 January 2020, MOPH expanded its surveillance procedures by implementing the highest level of precautionary measures and by scaling up the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in response to the surge of inbound Chinese tourists expected to arrive during the Chinese New Year Festival celebration (DDC, MoPH, 2020). On 23 January 2020, the first Thai citizen was confirmed with COVID-19, a 73 year-old woman with travel history to Wuhan (Bangkok Post, 2020b). At the same time, China locked down Wuhan and suspended all publictransportation, including city buses, the subway system, ferries and long-distance passenger transportation (Al Jazeera, 2020). On 30 January 2020 Thailand increased the screening protocol among workers in the tourist sector, such as tour guides, hotel staff, taxi drivers, and airport staff, who come in frequent contact with foreign tourists, especially Chinese tourists(Reuters, 2020). The MOPH conducted a meeting on the National Committee for Emerging Infectious Disease Preparedness, Prevention and Response on 30 January 2020 (NNT, 2020). On 31 January 2020, Thailand reported its first local case of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, in a Thai taxi driver within the country (Bangkok Post, 2020c).

Full scores were found in producing communication channels such as the development of an English website and distribution of general information and media briefings with knowledge to various target groups including general public and foreigners in-country. Mechanisms for timely information sharing to international authorities such as WHO, the ASEAN Secretariat, and effectively sharing website content to other countries through the existing mechanism of the ASEAN Secretariat were assessed with full scores as well.
