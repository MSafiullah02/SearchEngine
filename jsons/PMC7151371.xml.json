Both viruses share an amino acid sequence similarly of 76.5% (8) and utilise angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors as a mode of entry into healthy cells. Variations between the receptor-binding domain of the two brought about by mutations (9), genetic recombination (10), and natural selection (9) enable SARS-CoV-2 to bind to the receptor more effectively (8). Furthermore, evidence of genetic recombination as a mechanism of viral evolution has sparked concerns regarding the misdiagnosis of infections by SARS-CoV-2, inaccurate tracking of transmission rates, adaptation of the virus to human immunity, as well as increasing severity of the infection with time (10).",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the incubation time from infection to presentation of symptoms is 5.2 days, with a range of 1-14 days (17). Furthermore, the mean time from presentation of symptoms to seeking medical advice is 5.8 days, and to hospital admission is 12.5 days (4). The stages of the disease from onset of symptoms has been classified based on non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) findings and can be divided into early (0-4 days), progressive (5-8 days), peak (9-13 days), and absorption stage (\u226514 days) (18). Early stage disease consisted of subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) located in the lower lung lobes. The progressive stage demonstrated bilateral distribution of the infective process and diffuse GGO. Presence of dense consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and residual parenchymal bands indicates transition into the peak stage. Finally, the absorption stage which may last more than 26 days, appears to demonstrate a better controlled disease process on CT, gradual resolution, and signs of recovery (18).",

Of the 14.1% who deteriorated, when compared to the stabilised group (median age 37; range=32-41), the patients were significantly older (median age of 66; range=51-70), had a history of smoking, and presented with a higher maximum body temperature on admission (31).",

In children, severe pneumonia is indicated by cough or difficulty in breathing plus at least one of either central cyanosis or SpO2 <90%, severe respiratory distress (e.g. grunting, very severe chest indrawing), signs of pneumonia with a general danger sign (e.g. inability to breastfeed or drink, unconsciousness, or convulsions). ARDS presents with new or worsening respiratory symptoms within one week of known clinical insult, and chest imaging reveals bilateral lung opacities.

Within the hospital setting, however, high-filtration masks including N95, goggles, and gowns should be worn by healthcare professionals working in direct contact (within 1-2 metres) of infected patients (33). If an infected individual has been identified, rapid isolation and the administration of optimised care should be provided. Suspected patients should also be given a medical mask and placed in an isolation room if available. Wherever possible, the use of adequately ventilated single rooms when performing aerosol-generating procedures should be employed. All patients should be instructed to cover their nose and mouth during coughing or sneezing with tissue. Hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions should be enforced. If possible, use either disposable or dedicated equipment (e.g. stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and thermometers) for suspected cases, and avoid contaminating environmental surfaces (e.g. door handles).",

The number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds required is expected to reach 30 times the available number in both countries. With an aim to reach R0\u22641, the study recommends a combination of social distancing and case isolation in combination with household quarantine or school and University closures for a duration of 5 months, with maximum effects felt if all four interventions plus complete lockdown (i.e. individuals prevented from going to work) are implemented. Such measures are predicted to result in a decrease in the number of critical beds required by two-thirds, a figure which equates to 8 times the number of available ICU beds at present. With the above measures, they also estimate that the number of deaths will decrease by one-half - 250,000 and 1.1-1.2 million deaths in the UK and US respectively.",

The settings presented in Table 2\nhave been derived from the ARDSnet trial and can be used to achieve an Sp02 >90% (25,54).3)Early airway pressure release ventilation should be considered in certain patients (55).4)Consideration of early prone ventilation in patients where there is no improvement observed after twelve hours of ventilator optimisation (i.e. PaO2/FiO2<150). Prone ventilation should last 12-16 hours a day (25,55).5)Permissive hypercapnia may be considered if haemodynamically satisfactory parameters are maintained as opposed to forms of ventilation which may cause further lung damage (25,55).\n",

When remdesivir is injected into Vero E6 cells infected with COVID-19, the antiviral effectively inhibits the virus. When tested in human cell lines (Huh-7 cells) the virus is effectively inhibited (60). This supports the CDC\u2019s statement that remdesivir has in vitro activity against COVID-19 (61).

Implementation and adherence to tighter restrictions of social distancing to suppress and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 will prove to be crucial in the months to come. Up-to-date, evidence-based guidelines for acute management of COVID-19 are imperative to guide clinicians through the rapidly evolving pandemic. As new evidence emerges, it is imperative that current and potential treatment options are frequently re-evaluated in order to offer the best possible care under such unprecedented circumstances.",
