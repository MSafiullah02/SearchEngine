Vaccina virus is the prototype of the poxvirus family (for review, see MossS). These are DNA viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm and have genomes between 150 and 300 kbp. The virions are large and complex, and in the case of VV, have dimensions of 250 x 350 nm and contain more than 100 proteins. 6 The study of VV binding and entry has been complicated by the fact that there are two morphologically distinct infectious virions, termed intracellular mature virus (IMV) and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). 7'8 Structurally, IMV consists of a core surrounded by one membrane, 9'1\u00b0 whereas EEV consists of an IMV with an additional outer membrane containing proteins, which is absent from IMV (Fig. 1) . IMV remains within the cytoplasm until cell lysis and represents the majority of infectious progeny; for instance, with the Western Reserve (WR) strain of virus, IMV represents 99% of infectivity. In contrast, EEV is released actively from infected cells before cell lysis and is the form of the virus that is important for virus dissemination in vitro and in Extracellular enveloped virus is formed by the wrapping of IMV with 5",

            "text": "In this article, these techniques are described and then illustrated with some of the results obtained. Although the utility of the techniques reviewed here have been demonstrated with W, given the resolution of the confocal microscope, these methods should be applicable to any virus larger than two membranes derived from the trans-Golgi network or early tubular endosomes forming an intracellular enveloped particle (IEV) that has three membranes. This particle moves to the cell surface where a fusion event between the plasma membrane and the outer membrane of IEV forms a virus with two membranes. This particle may remain attached to the cell surface as cell-associated enveloped virus (CEV) or be released from the cell as EEV. The proportion of enveloped virus that is either retained on the cell surface or released into the medium varies with different strains of virus. At least 12 proteins that are absent from IMV are associated with the outer envelope of EEV. 14q6 Six VV genes are known to encode these proteins (for review, see Smith and Vanderplasschen aT) and, in addition, several cellular proteins are present in the EEV envelope. 16 These proteins endow EEV with different biological and immunological properties. 7,n,16 '18 The presence of these two infectious forms of virus complicates studies investigating the binding of virions to cells or entry into cells. In order to obtain data relating to only one form of the virus, it is necessary to either purify the different viruses from each other and to study each in isolation or devise a method to study both forms simultaneously within a mixed preparation and to distinguish one from the other. The extra membrane of EEV gives the virus different physical properties such that it may be separated from IMV by sedimentation through CsC1 density gradients. TM In these gradients, IMV and EEV sediment at 1.27 and 1.23 g/ml, respectively. TM However, the EEV outer membrane is a loose and extremely fragile structure 19 that is damaged by virus purification, 17,2\u00b0-22 and once it is ruptured, the particle retains full infectivity as an IMV. 23,24 Consequently, the mechanism of binding and penetration of intact EEV may be different from that of damaged EEV having IMV proteins exposed on its surface. 17,2\u00b0-22 Therefore, binding and penetration studies should not be performed using purified EEV. To overcome this problem, we developed [331 binding and entry assays that allow the use of fresh supernatants of infected cells as the source of EEV. These assays are based on confocal microscopy and the use of monoclonal antibodies that are specific to each form of the virus.",

IMV was purified using sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described by Joklik. 32 EEV was purified from the culture supernatant by first removing detached cells and large cell debris by lowspeed centrifugation and then pelleting the virus by ultracentrifugation. The pelleted virus was then resuspended by vortexing and sonication and was purified on CsC1 or sucrose density gradients. While CsCI gradients in particular give good separation of IMV and EEV, it was discovered that the majority of EEV particles purified from density gradients had a damaged outer envelope. This was shown by the neutralization of the majority of infectivity in these preparations by a monoclonal antibody specific for IMV (methods). The ability of an IMV-specific antibody to neutralize \"EEV\" indicated that the integrity of the EEV outer envelope was broken and IMV antigens were exposed, and consequently it would be unknown if the virions were binding to cells via antigens present on the IMV or EEV 32 W.

The idea was to quantify the number of individual virions bound on the cell surface at 4 \u00b0 (a temperature that prevents virus entry). The infectivity of fresh culture supernatant was found to contain mostly EEV, but was contaminated with a significant proportion (15-25%) of IMV, and therefore its use for binding studies required an assay that permitted the differentiation of IMV and EEV. With that goal in mind, we used a double immunofluorescent staining with MAb AB 1.1 and MAb 19C2 against the D8L and B5R gene products, respectively, on fixed and permeabilized samples (Fig. 2) . D8L encodes a 32-kDa protein present on the IMV surface 28 and 19C2 detects the EEV-specific 42-kDa glycoprotein B5R. 29 Biotinylated MAb ABI.1 and MAb 19C2 were used as primary MAbs and were subsequently revealed by Rd-Strep and FITC-RAR, respectively. Following this staining procedure, EEV virions appeared as double positive (red and green) loci, whereas IMV virions were single (red) fluorescent foci on the cell surface. Each fluorescent focus was shown to represent an isolated particle and not a cluster of virions by measuring the size of the spots.

These techniques are illustrated with a study of the binding and entry of VV. The methods have been particularly useful for studying VV because this virus produces two different forms of infectious virion that are antigenically and biologically distinct and are produced in widely differing amounts. Moreover, the EEV form of VV cannot be purified from contaminating IMV without disrupting the integrity of the outer envelope. Such rupture does not destroy virus infectivity because the IMV particle within the outer envelope remains infectious, but a damaged EEV particle with both IMV and EEV antigens exposed might bind to cells via either type of antigen. Purified EEV preparations therefore are unsuitable for binding and entry assays. These problems were overcome by using fresh unpurified virus that contains both EEV and IMV and simultaneously identifying and distinguishing these forms of virus by double immunofluorescent staining followed by confocal microscopy. Data obtained with the methods described in this article have helped to establish that the IMV and EEV virions bind to different cellular receptors and enter cells by different mechanisms.",

Thus there is no need to use radioactive tracers during the growth of virus or to label the virus after purification with, for instance, fluorescent markers or biotin. Potentially these latter methods might compromise the virion integrity or change its biological properties. (ii) The method generates absolute numbers of virions per cell, not mean numbers representing the average number of virions bound in the whole cell population. Therefore the binding assay could identify specific cells within a mixed cell population that are binding virus particles. For W , the identification of cells that are unable to bind IMV and EEV, or either form of virus, would be a useful step toward identifying the cellular receptors for these viruses by expression cloning. (iii) The methods may be used to determine the particle infectivity ratios of viruses and to identify the proportion of virions that bind to cells that give rise to a productive infection. (iv) The methods provide steric information about the site on a cell to which a virion binds in relation to specific cellular antigens or the binding sites for other virions. This was illustrated by the binding of EEV to sites distinct from that identified by a MAb that blocked IMV binding.

Those methods do not require purified or labeled virus, provide absolute numbers of virus or cores/cell, give steric information concerning the position of the virus or the core, and allow the dissection of the replication cycle by investigating only binding or entry. Although the utility of those techniques has been demonstrated here with VV, they should be applicable to any virus larger than 50 nm.",

Detection and identification of IMV and EEV on the cell surface by double immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy. RKa3 cells were mock infected (A-C) or infected on ice with purified IMV (D-F) or fresh EEV (G-I). The cells were then treated as described in Methods for the simultaneous detection of D8L and B5R gene products by double indirect immunofluorescent staining. Biotinylated MAb ABI.1 and MAb 19C2 were used as primary MAbs and were revealed by Rd-Strep and FITC-RAR, respectively. Horizon-tally~ the three panels represent analysis of the same cells. The first (A, D, G) and second (B, E, H) columns of panels represent the analysis for Rd and FITC fluorescent emissions, respectively. The third (C, F, I) column represents the merged Rd and FITC signals. The arrows in (G) identify particles (IMV) that were detected by MAb ABI.1 but not by MAb 19C2. The bar in (I) represents 2/zm.
