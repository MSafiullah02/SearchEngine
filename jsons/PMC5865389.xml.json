The World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting in March 2017 to review policies on immunization of adults (with a focus on older adults), to discuss vaccine performance in this group and to review the pipeline of vaccines under development that might be of benefit to adults and older adults in the future. While the meeting was relevant to HICs as well as LMICs, the focus was intentionally on the latter. The only vaccines with WHO recommendations for specific use in elderly adults are influenza vaccines [1], therefore influenza and influenza prevention represented an important case study and area of discussion in the meeting for vaccine policy and implementation needs globally. Finally, the meeting aimed to discuss the challenges and opportunities for strengthening adult immunization in LMICs and to identify activities and policies that can be pursued to this end.",

Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. The agenda and list of participants are in the Online Supplement. The two-day meeting was organized around a series of background topic areas, followed by case studies in LMICs, and then discussion on data needs for policies and investments of vaccine programs targeting older adults. This report is based on presentations and discussion from the meeting.",

This ability depends on both an individual\u2019s physical and mental capacities and on the environments one inhabits (for example access to transport and assistive devices) [10]. As described in the WHO\u2019s World Report on Ageing and Health [11], while intrinsic capacity tends to decline with increasing age, a primary characteristic of older ages is great diversity. Even in the poorest settings, an eighty year old may be healthy, independent, and vibrant, while a sixty year old may need significant care and support. Chronological age is thus a poor marker of health state, and there is no fixed age when someone becomes \u201cold\u201d. Furthermore, this diversity is often a consequence of the cumulative impacts of advantage or disadvantage across a person\u2019s life. This means that those with the greatest health needs in older age may have the least access to the specific required resources.",

Rather than defining target groups for vaccination solely by their chronological age, assessing an individual\u2019s level of capacity may add important information on their need for vaccination, response to vaccination, or the functional benefits likely to arise. For example, where a vaccine is currently recommended for those above 65 years [12], some individuals may benefit from vaccination at an earlier age because of declining capacity. While implementing this approach would require development and adoption of simple and robust measures of capacity in a clinical setting, discussions of this topic may be beneficial in order to better understand optimal target groups for vaccination.",

Biomarkers for these changes have the potential to inform more rapid vaccine development for older adults. The number of na\u00efve T lymphocytes declines with age, following involution of the thymus after puberty, compromising the ability to respond to new vaccinations (or infections). It has also been suggested that the expanded T cell responses required to keep persistent infections controlled, such as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), reduces \u201cspace\u201d for new T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells [55]; however, the effect of HCMV infection on immune function, including the response to influenza vaccine, appears to be heterogeneous, and is seen only in older individuals who might have had persistent HCMV infection for decades [56]. Recently, older adults were shown to have increased senescent and exhausted varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific T cells which may contribute to their inability to prevent VZV reactivation and the subsequent development of herpes zoster [57].",

Achieving high vaccination coverage in target groups outside the traditional program can be difficult. Countries considering strengthening immunization platforms for older adults would benefit from strategies and lessons learned from similar efforts in other age groups [74]. Currently, more than 80 countries have introduced human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into their national immunization programs, usually with school-based vaccination; 33 of these are LMICs, and an additional 25 LMICs are undertaking pilot programs prior to full scale introduction [75]. Lessons learned from HPV programs [76], including the usefulness of pilots or demonstration projects [77], could be valuable for establishing new platforms for adult vaccines, especially ones where multi-dose regimens are required [78]. For example, adults taking infants to a pediatric vaccination clinic could also be offered immunizations or other services.",

Governments must see the value in a new vaccine before they are willing to introduce it and this requires recognition of the burden of disease and the fact that an affordable, deliverable vaccine is available. Purchasers (donors, governments or private health providers) are unlikely to pay for the vaccine unless they think it will be seen as a priority by end users, and vaccine developers and manufacturers will not produce the vaccine unless they believe it will be purchased. Other reasons relate to the general lack of awareness by adults that vaccine-preventable diseases such as pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza and shingles can have devastating effects on the health, function and socioeconomic contributions of a normal healthy older person, let alone those who may have a chronic condition such as diabetes.",

Further, new ways to look at impact of vaccine programs, that take into account the contributions of healthy older adults and the consequences of their declining intrinsic capacities to society, are needed. Two clear conclusions from the meeting were that immunization of adults should be viewed as a key component of a comprehensive approach to health, and that protecting older adults from vaccine-preventable diseases might mean achieving high vaccine coverage in all age groups (including infants), and not simply older adults. Additionally, the need for vaccine research and development related to immunosenescence was identified, given the remarkable increase in the population of older adults.",

Activities to improve coverage with infant vaccines should not diminish, but an increasing emphasis needs to be placed on life-course approach to immunization schedules to protect adults and older adults, especially given the significant and changing demographics of the global population. There is already some evidence from HICs of the benefits of using existing vaccines in older adults [49], [82]. Although the efficacy of some vaccines might be lower in older adults than is usually seen with infant vaccines, these data need to be viewed in the context of the increased risks from disease and broader social and economic benefits of prevention in older populations.
