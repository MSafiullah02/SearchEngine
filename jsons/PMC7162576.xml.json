Blood tests showed leucocytosis (12.6\u00d7109/l) with a predominance of polynuclear neutrophils (11.72\u00d7109/l) but normal lymphocyte and platelet counts. Electrolytes, liver, renal and coagulation tests were within normal ranges. The chest CT demonstrated the presence of ground-glass opacification in the right lower lobe. The investigations were completed with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was hospitalized in a normal hospital bed. Asymptomatic treatment and an oxygen supply were initiated. The clinical course was marked by the absence of any clinical or biological complications and the patient was discharged 14 days after hospital admission.",

While the olfactory nerve cells within the nasal lining can be infected and die, stem cells rapidly generate new nerve cells which extend their long connections back up into the brain to restore the pathway. Depending on the severity of the initial infection, the sense of smell can return within a few days or weeks. Patients with taste loss actually have an impaired sense of smell, which has a huge impact on their ability to detect flavour. Smell and taste both contribute to perception of flavour, making difficult for patients to separate the two senses.",
