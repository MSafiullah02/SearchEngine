The past decade has seen some considerable advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CNS infections, despite some major challenges, such as the emergence of novel pathogens, the spread of existing pathogens to new geographical areas as a result of travel and climate change, and more-severe outbreaks caused by existing pathogens becoming more virulent, and increasing numbers of immunocompromised people. As organizers of the Gordon Research Conferences on Infections of the Nervous System in 2013 and 2015, we have had the opportunity to closely follow the advances made in the prevention and treatment of CNS infections. Despite these advances, many unmet challenges remain, including the rise of resistance to the antimalarial drug artemisin in patients with severe cerebral malaria, which has increased morbidity and mortality, re-emergence of arbovirus-induced CNS disease, limited treatment options for cryptococcal meningitis, and failure of the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, to name a few.",

Chikungunya infections are characterized by fever, headache, rashes, and debilitating arthralgia that can continue for years after infection. Atypical manifestations have also been described, and include neurological symptoms that range from simple and complex febrile seizures to meningeal syndrome, acute encephalopathy, diplopia, aphasia, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and encephalitis.3 After its first reported appearance in 1952, the virus re-emerged in the Indian Ocean islands in 2005\u20132006, and several outbreaks of Chikungunya infection have occurred since late 2013, particularly in the Caribbean islands and the Americas, but also in several countries in Africa and Southern Europe. Increased global travel, evolution of the virus and adaptation of mosquito vectors have all been suggested as contributing factors to the spread of the virus to new geographical areas.3 No vaccination or treatment for Chikungunya virus exists, and avoiding mosquito bites is currently the only way to prevent the disease.",

Outbreaks of new influenza strains, such as H5N1, have also highlighted the potential of such viruses to cause neurological disease.4 In recent years, the number of immunocompromised individuals who are particularly susceptible to CNS infection has increased owing to the HIV epidemic and increased use of immunosuppressive treatments, for example to induce immune tolerance after organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders. Neurologists should be particularly aware of the risk of CNS infection in patients who are immunocompromised, because many neurological disorders are treated with immunosuppressive therapies. Perhaps the most prominent example of such disorders is multiple sclerosis (MS), for which several new drugs have been approved in the past decade. Similarly, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC virus was once rare, but its prevalence has increased with that of HIV, and in the past 10 years, the use of new immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies, such as natalizumab for MS, has become another important trigger for the disease.5",

However, the drug is often of no benefit to adults or children in developing, tropical countries, perhaps because patients in these countries are more likely to have untreated HIV.8 In Vietnamese adults with tuberculous meningitis, dexamethasone reduced mortality and is now used for most patients with this condition.",
