Methods include the bed-up-head-elevated position, airway manoeuvres, use of a positive end expiratory pressure valve, and airway adjuncts. If manual bagging is required, we suggest gentle ventilation via a supraglottic device instead of bag mask ventilation. Although no robust evidence is available to show that the use of supraglottic devices are less aerosol-generating than BMV, the devices are easy to insert and can achieve sufficient seal pressure. They also help to spare manpower and thus reduce staff exposure. Furthermore, many newer generation supraglottic devices provide a conduit for unassisted intubation.",
