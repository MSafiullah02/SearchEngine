The growing mobility of people and popularity of airline transportation has amplified the potential for disease to be transmitted to passengers not only during but also before and after flights. Here, we review knowledge about transmission of infectious diseases associated with commercial air travel, with particular emphasis on transmission within the aircraft passenger cabin.",

            "text": "During flight, the aircraft cabin is a ventilated, enclosed environment that exposes passengers to hypobaric hypoxia, dry humidity, and close proximity to fellow passengers. This space is regulated by an environmental system that controls pressurisation, temperature, ventilation, and air filtration on the aircraft. Although this system is wholly automated, the number of air-conditioning packs in operation, zone temperatures, and the mixture of fresh and re-circulated air delivered to the cabin can be manipulated by the flight deck.1 When parked at the terminal, fresh air is supplied to the aircraft by auxiliary power units. During flight, fresh air is supplied into the cabin from the engines where the air is heated, compressed, cooled, and passed into the cabin to be circulated by the ventilation system.3 The outside air is assumed to be sterile at typical cruising altitudes. Air circulation patterns aboard standard commercial aircraft are side-to-side (laminar) with air entering the cabin from overhead, circulating across the aircraft, and exiting the cabin near the floor (figure 1\n). Little front-to-back (longitudinal) airflow takes place.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 This air circulation pattern divides the air flow into sections within the cabin, thereby limiting the spread of airborne particles throughout the passenger cabin.",

HEPA filters also effectively capture viral particles because viruses usually spread by droplet nuclei.7, 11 No ventilation operational standards for commercial aircraft are available. Although a survey showed that most air carriers equip their large aircraft with HEPA filters, neither the Civil Aviation Authority nor the Federal Aviation Administration require their use.9, 12, 13\n",

However, no peer-reviewed scientific work links cabin air quality and aircraft ventilation rates to heightened health risks compared with other modes of transport or with office buildings,4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 so this work is limited.7, 9, 12 These shortcomings motivated the UK government to form the Aviation Health Working Group in 2000 to further investigate health aspects of air travel, including cabin air quality and safety. In a detailed study into cabin air quality released in 2004, the group concluded that temperature, humidity, air speed, and concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and microbiological flora aboard 14 commercial flights using British Aerospace 146 and Boeing 300 aircraft were similar to other reported studies.23 The European Cabin Air study coordinated by the Building Research and Consultancy continues to investigate environmental aspects within the passenger cabin. These efforts will probably lead to improved international regulations for the certification, inspection, and maintenance of aircraft environmental control systems.13, 17, 24\n",

Large droplet transmission is judged a form of contact transmission in which large droplets (>5 microns) contaminated with microorganisms are generated when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. These droplets are propelled short distances (<1 m) and deposited on a susceptible host's conjunctiva or mucosa. Airborne transmission happens by aerolisation of an infectious agent through droplet nuclei (residua of large droplets containing microorganisms that have evaporated to <5 microns). These residual droplets become aerosolised and disperse widely, dependent on environmental conditions, and remain suspended in air for indefinite periods.5, 27, 28 Common vehicle transmission involves one inanimate vehicle, which transmits infection to many hosts, and typically applies to microorganisms spread by food and water. Vector-borne transmission results from the spread of disease by insects and vermin. The table\nshows the infectious diseases that have been transmitted on commercial airlines. All types of disease transmission are relevant to commercial air travel.",

Several studies about in-flight transmission of tuberculosis have been reported, with most being done in the mid-1990s.4, 29, 30, 39, 40, 41 Two of the seven investigations revealed a probable link of onboard transmission. In the first occurrence, a flight attendant was the index case, and two documented tuberculin skin test conversions occurred during 5 months in 1992 in 212 fellow crew members and 59 frequent flyer passengers.39 The second, and largest, incident was of a passenger with pulmonary tuberculosis travelling from Baltimore to Chicago and then on to Honolulu.29 Four of 15 fellow passengers seated within two rows of the index passenger had positive tuberculin skin test conversion. Although there is a risk of tuberculosis within the aircraft cabin, no cases of active disease have been reported as a result of air travel. Transmission within the aircraft cabin seems to be more likely with close proximity to a contagious passenger (within two rows) over a long time (greater than 8 h) and not as a result of the practice of recirculating 50% of the cabin air.4, 9, 12, 29 An overall probability of infection in the order of one in 1000 when a symptomatic source is present has been suggested,35 and this probability of risk is similar to, if not less than, those in other confined spaces.42\n",

The fact that influenza outbreaks worldwide have been affected by influenza strains imported by air travel is well established;52, 53, 54 however, only three studies of in-flight transmission of influenza have been reported.33, 37, 55 The first was in an outbreak of influenza A/Texas strain aboard a commercial carrier in 197937 that resulted in 72% of all passengers aboard the airline contracting influenza within 72 h. The secondary attack rate in their families was estimated to be 20% within 2 weeks. The high transmission rate in this particular case was believed attributable to passengers being kept aboard the aircraft for 3 h with an inoperative ventilation system while repair work was being done. The second study described an outbreak of influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 at a naval air station in 1989 in military personnel who were returning from temporary duty.55 Transmission of influenza occurred both on the ground and aboard two DC-9 aircraft that transported the squadron from Puerto Rico to a Florida naval station. The third outbreak happened in 1999 in mine workers travelling on a 75-seat aircraft.33 15 passengers travelling with the index case developed symptoms within 4 days. Nine of the 15 were seated within two rows, and all were seated within five rows, of the index case. No further influenza outbreaks aboard commercial aircraft have been reported since 1999.",

People seated next to an ill passenger should be quickly contacted and given chemoprophylaxis within 24 h of identifying the index case. Chemoprophylaxis given more than 14 days after onset of illness in the index case is probably of little or no value.56 Measles is an airborne and highly contagious viral infection with an attack rate of about 80%.57 Transmission can occur during the prodromal illness and passengers might be unaware of their diagnosis at the time of travel. Measles is no longer endemic in the USA and importations from developing countries account for most outbreaks. Imported measles and associated cases accounted for at least 17% of all reported cases within the USA during 1982.58 From 1996 to 2000 30% of all imported measles cases were estimated to be in people who flew while symptomatic with the disease.59, 60\n",

In 2004, a passenger with measles travelled from Japan to Hawaii, but this did not result in any transmission to other air travellers.59 International adoptions have a significant role in the number of imported measles cases. In April, 2004, an outbreak in children adopted from an orphanage in China resulted in temporary suspension of adoptions from that particular orphanage.60 Nine of the ten confirmed cases were thought to be infectious while travelling. One secondary case was a female student in close contact with an infected child.",

The largest outbreak of airline-associated cholera occurred in 1992, during a cholera epidemic in Latin America.68 During a flight from Buenos Aires via Lima to Los Angeles, 75 passengers developed cholera, resulting in ten passengers being admitted and one death. A cold seafood dish, prepared in one of the cholera-affected countries, was implicated as the source of transmission. No food-borne or water-borne outbreaks have been reported over the past 5 years, which is probably attributable to greater use of prepackaged frozen meals, improved food handling, and inspection, but might represent under-reporting by passengers or reporting bias.",

Many cases of malaria occurring in and around airports all over the world in people who had not travelled to endemic areas, known as airport malaria, is evidence that malaria-carrying mosquitoes can be imported on aircraft.69, 70 A total of 87 cases of airport malaria have been reported, 75 of which happened in Europe.70 Dengue and yellow fever are both transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. The Aedes mosquito has been introduced into countries where it had not previously been present and many of these mosquitoes were likely to have spread by aircraft.69 A case of dengue fever was reported in Germany in a couple returning from a trip to Hawaii.71 Airport transmission of dengue fever was suspected in this particular case. The disinsection of aircraft\u2014spraying aircraft before landing to kill insects\u2014and vector control around airports, as well as immunisation requirements, seem to have been effective in preventing outbreaks in non-endemic areas. Although International Health Regulations recommend disinsecting aircraft travelling from countries with malaria and other vector-borne diseases, only five countries do so.69, 72, 73 Common and exotic animals are regularly transported on aircraft and may carry disease. Many zoonotic pathogens cause emerging and re-emerging diseases.74, 75 Up to now, no zoonotic outbreaks associated with air travel have been reported; however, continued monitoring of air transport of animals, especially from developing countries, is needed.",
