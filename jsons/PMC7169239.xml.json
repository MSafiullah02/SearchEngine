In contrast, the most common radiographical features in MERS patients were ground\u2013glass opacities and consolidation.60, 61 Das et al. reported that ground\u2013glass opacity was the most common abnormality (66%) in 55 MERS patients, followed by consolidation (18%).61 Meanwhile, type 2 radiographical progression (20 patients) was most common in those MERS patients, followed by type 4 (14 patients) and type 3 (7 patients). Type 1 radiographical progression was observed only in four patients. Pleural effusion (P = 0.001), pneumothorax (P = 0.001) and type 4 radiographical progression (P = 0.001) were more frequent in MERS patients who died compared with recovered patients. Similar to the radiographical findings, computed tomography findings in MERS patients also included ground\u2013glass opacity (53%), consolidation (20%) or a combination of both (33%).62 Pleural effusion was noted in 33% of cases and was associated with a poor prognosis for MERS\u2010CoV infection.61\n",
