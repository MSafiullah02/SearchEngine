            "text": "Mammalian reoviruses are members of the Reoviridae family and infect a variety of mammalian species but have not yet been clearly associated with any serious human disease (1) . Despite this low pathogenicity in humans, reoviruses have been extensively used as model system and have provided numerous insights in the study of transcription, translation and virus-cell interactions. These nonenveloped viruses contain 10 segments of genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) enclosed in two concentric icosahedral capsids made of eight viral proteins (1) . The reovirus inner capsid consists of three major proteins (l1, l2, and s2) and two minor proteins (l3 and m2) while the outer capsid is composed primarily of three proteins (s1, s3, and m1C). Recent structural studies have demonstrated that most of l2 resides within the outer capsid and suggest that l2 can also be considered as an outer capsid protein bound to the inner capsid (2\u00b14). A schematic representation of the position of the various proteins in both outer and inner capsid is shown in Fig. 1 . The reovirus genome also encodes three nonstructural proteins (sNS, mNS, and s1S) that are not incorporated into mature virions but likely mediate various functions during viral multiplication (1) .",

Analysis of gene reassortants generated upon co-infection with two different viral strains has thus allowed the assignment of certain functions to speci\u00aec viral proteins. In the past few years, rapid accumulation of nucleic acids and deduced amino acids sequences in databases has led to important progress in structure-function studies of proteins from various sources. Although the nucleotide sequence of all ten reovirus genes has been determined, this information has only been partly exploited to increase our understanding of the structural and functional properties of reovirus proteins. In the present study, computer-assisted searches for sequence similarities were performed on all eleven proteins from mammalian reoviruses. These searches were performed using several programs to identify global or local regions of signi\u00aecant similarity between reovirus proteins and other amino acid sequences. These analysis revealed that many proteins of reoviruses are partially similar to known viral or cellular proteins. The results obtained with 7 of the 11 reovirus proteins are systematically presented, compared with known or suspected functions of these proteins, and signi\u00aecance of these results is brie\u00afy discussed in the context of reovirus multiplication.",

It has been shown Sequence Analysis of Reovirus Proteins that assembly of the outer capsid requires the cleavage of the primary translation product m1 to generate m1C (2). Proteolytic processing is a common mechanism used by numerous viruses for the generation of functional viral proteins. Such cleavage can be mediated by cellular enzymes but viral-encoded proteases are most often involved (14) . Studies have demonstrated that the s3 protein is required for m1 to m1C cleavage and that no other viral product appears to be necessary for this cleavage to occur (15) . It has previously been noted that the amino-terminal domain of s3 from all three reovirus serotypes possesses a short amino acid sequence similar to a conserved region of picornaviral proteases (16) . Computerassisted sequence analysis revealed that the reovirus CGGAVVCMH sequence is similar to the consensus CGGxUxCxH sequence present in protease 2A of poliovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, swine vesicular disease virus, and coxsackieviruses (Fig. 2) ; amino acid residues (cysteine and histidine) directly involved in the picornaviral catalytic activity were identi\u00aeed as part of this consensus sequence (17\u00b119).",

The presence of a conserved glycine residue, 2\u00b13 amino acids following the CGGxUxCxH consensus sequence, was also revealed by this alignment (Fig. 2 In addition to its structural role, it has been suggested that s3 exerts a role in the modulation of inhibition of host-cell protein synthesis consecutive to reovirus infection; differences in the extent of inhibition observed upon infection by different viral strains map to the S4 gene, which encodes the s3 protein (21) . The mechanism of inhibition remains largely unknown but several studies indicated that s3 can downregulate the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) probably by sequestering dsRNA (22\u00b124). A role for free s3, rather than s3 complexed with m1/ m1C, has been proposed for this downregulation (15, 22, 23, 25) . Activation of PKR normally results in phosphorylation of eIF-2a and inhibition of translation initiation (26) . However, a proteolytic degradation of translational initiation factors could also be responsible for the inhibition of host-cell protein synthesis as observed during the multiplication of other viruses (27) . A similar mechanism has been previously suggested for reovirus, although experimental evidence is lacking. The cleavage of some component of the cellular transcriptional machinery by s3 thus remains an attractive possibility.",

By directly binding to the catalytic subunit of PP2A, it was suggested that s3 might modulate the enzymatic activity of PP2A (30) . This is yet another evidence that the s3 protein is involved in the regulation of translation during the later stages of reovirus infection (32) . However, such similarity between s3 and PP2A was not detected using the BLASTP program in the present study.

The s1 protein is a minor component of the outer capsid and can assume an extended conformation in which it appears as a long \u00aeber projecting from the particle surface at the 12 vertices of the icosahedral capsid (1). Thin-section electron micrographs of cells soon after reovirus infection revealed particles associated with clathrincoated pits or vesicles near the plasma membrane, suggesting that uptake from the cell surface consecutive to receptor binding occurs by receptormediated endocytosis (33, 34) . As with other nonenveloped viruses, the mechanism by which reoviruses cross the endosomal membrane barrier during entry into cells is still poorly understood. It has been suggested that a direct effect of viral components can result in local disruption of the membrane bilayer to allow the entry in the cytoplasm; alternatively, a more speci\u00aec porelike structure might be formed by viral proteins within the membrane (33,35\u00b137). During the natural course of gastro-intestinal reovirus infection, intermediate subviral particles (ISVPs) are apparently formed by the action of intestinal proteolytic enzymes (38) . These particles differ notably from the virions in protein composition and conformation since most of the outer capsid is removed (1). It has been noted that when similar particles are generated in vitro, virions can directly penetrate through the plasma membrane, given they have been treated with chymotrypsin, thus bypassing endocytosis (33, 35) . The d protein, a cleavage product of outer capsid protein m1C, seems to be implicated in mediating interactions with membranes: a strain difference in the capacity of ISVPs to mediate 51 Cr release from L cells via cell lysis or permeabilization was mapped to the M2 gene, which encodes m1 and therefore m1C and d (39) .",

This 316 amino acids bacteriophage protein is identical, except for four amino acids residues, to the N-terminal region of reovirus T3D s1 protein. Such high levels of identity between two proteins of unrelated viruses is very unusual but very signi\u00aecant at the P 6X2610 \u00c0198 level. The SF6 lysozyme is able to hydrolyze the 1,4b-linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and Nacetylmuramic acid in peptidoglycan heteropolymers of the bacterial cell wall, although the role of this enzyme in penetration and/or lysis of susceptible bacterial cells has not been clearly established (40) . The s1 proteins from reovirus T1L and T2J harbor divergent forms of the protein, since s1 is the principal antigen against which the serotype-speci\u00aec humoral response is directed (6,7), and thus possess reduced but still signi\u00aecant identity with the SF6 lysozyme. The s1 protein from reovirus T1L showed a 25.3% identity and a total similarity of 42.1% while the s1 protein from reovirus T2J harbors a 25.6% identity and a total similarity of 41.5% (Fig. 5a) . These results revealed a statistically signi\u00aecant amino acid match between the s1 protein from serotypes T1L and T2J and the lysozyme protein of bacteriophage SF6 at the P 8X7610 \u00c012 and 1X3610 \u00c09 levels, respectively. Despite this divergence between serotypes, all s1 proteins share conserved regions that are similar to the C-terminal half of the bacteriophage SF6 lysozyme (Fig. 5b) . The effect of lysozymes on mammalian cells has not been thoroughly examined but it has been reported that lysozymes can decrease DNA replication of cultured cells (41) , as also observed during reovirus infection (42) . It might be signi\u00aecant that this effect of reovirus was mapped to the S1 gene, which encodes the s1 protein (43) . Inhibition of DNA synthesis during reovirus infection occurs through a membrane-linked signalling pathway, suggesting that interaction at the membrane surface is required (44) .",

Although reovirus virions appear to be devoid of such hydrolytic activity, infectious subviral particles (ISVPs), generated in vitro by partial uncoating using chymotrypsin digestion of puri\u00aeed virions, are able to hydrolyze the glycoside substrates (Bisaillon and Lemay, unpublished results). The conformational changes induced in s1 upon removal of the outer capsid (45) are probably required to expose the helical aminoterminal portion of the protein that is buried deeper in the virion and that harbors most similarity to lysozyme. Activation of such a lysozyme-like activity upon partial uncoating by intestinal enzymes could be involved in degradation of sugar moieties in mucins covering epithelial cells, thus facilitating viral infection. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that mucin covering epithelial cells can inhibit adenovirus and rotavirus infection (46, 47) ; evolution of a mechanism for degradation of mucin layers could thus present a selective advantage to the virus. In fact, such a mucin-degrading enzyme has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo for baculovirus; in vivo degradation of mucin was correlated with the enhancement of baculovirus infection in insects (48) .",

The role of m2 during reovirus infection remains unknown but it has been reported that thermosensitive m2 mutants fail to synthesize dsRNA at nonpermissive temperature (52, 53) . Furthermore, temperature optimum of transcription maps to the M1 gene encoding the m2 protein further suggesting a role for this protein in synthesis of viral nucleic acids (53) . Sequence analysis of m2 reveals that the central portion of the protein shares some similarities with enzymes involved in nucleic acids metabolism, namely adenosine deaminases from E. coli, mouse and human (Fig. 7a) . This 25-amino acid domain harbors a 44% similarity with the human and mouse adenosine deaminases while the E. coli enzyme displays a little less similarity with the reovirus m2 protein (40% similarity). Another region of the m2 protein harbors similarities with an adenine deaminase from Bacillus subtilis and with a probable adenine deaminase from E. coli (Fig. 7b) . It was observed that the primary sequence of m2 shares 39% amino acid identity with the putative E. coli deaminase and a 48% similarity over a region of 44 amino acids. This last region also shares some common residues with the recently isolated dsRNA adenosine deaminase (DRADA) protein from human and rat and with dsRNA-speci\u00aec editase (RED1) protein from rat. Analysis of the resulting alignment revealed that m2 shares two other similar regions with the human DRADA (Fig. 7b) . Over these three domains encompassing 95 amino acids, 25 of the residues (26%) were identical with the human DRADA protein and 9 (10%) were scored as similar by the BLOSUM62 matrix for a total similarity of 36%. The rat RED1 protein also shares 29% identity and 33% similarity over these two regions. These last two cellular enzymes (human DRADA and rat RED1) are involved in conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded secondary structures present on mRNA molecules (54, 55) . This mechanism is responsible for RNA editing, a biochemical process involving the modi\u00aecation of mRNAs, since inosine residues are``read'' as guanosine during translation (56) .",

A similar phenomenon was also described in measles virus isolated from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (58) . Adenosine to guanosine hypermutations were also found in two escape mutants of another paramyxovirus, the human respiratory syncitial virus, and in the U3 region of an avian lymphomatous retrovirus (59, 60) . Hepatitis deltavirus (HDV) nucleotide 1012 is also edited from uridine to cytidine in 10\u00b140% of the RNA genomes during replication (61) . Although reoviruses commonly cause lytic infections, they can also produce nonlytic, persistent infections in a variety of cultured cells (62\u00b164). However, the detailed mechanisms responsible for the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections are poorly understood but clearly involve mutations in the virus leading to a decrease in cellular injury that commonly accompanies lytic infections. It is possible to speculate a role of high mutation rate in viral persistence as in measles virus-induced subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (57, 58) . Current evidence is that mutations in speci\u00aec viral genes have also a primary effect in the establishment of persistence (65\u00b1 68). Obviously, if reovirus encodes a protein with adenosine deaminase activity, this could contribute to a more rapid modi\u00aecation of the information encoded by viral mRNAs and accumulation of mutations. The presence of an actual editing mechanism in reovirus, and its putative role in viral persistence, certainly deserves to be investigated.",

A lysine-containing motif, KxDG, is conserved among guanylyltransferases encoded by DNA viruses (vaccinia virus, Shope \u00aebroma virus, African swine fever virus) and the yeasts S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (75, 76) . This motif is also conserved at the active site of polynucleotide ligases which, like guanylyltransferases, catalyze their reaction via the formation of a covalent Lys-nucleoside monophosphate intermediate (77) . In addition to the active guanylyltransferase site (KxDG), other conserved sequence elements were identi\u00aeed in guanylyltransferases from DNA viruses and yeasts (76) . These elements were shown to be essential for capping enzyme function in vivo (76) . Although the reovirus l2 protein covalently binds GTP, it lacks these conserved motifs. A similar situation is observed in rotavirus VP3 and bluetongue virus VP4 proteins, all viral guanylyltransferases from viruses of the Reoviridae family. These capping enzymes apparently evolved differently from other viral and cellular guanylyltransferases, despite their identical enzymatic functions. The Lys(226) residue of the reovirus l2 protein KPTNG sequence has been identi\u00aeed as the GMP attachment site (71) ; this sequence differs from the consensus signature of DNA viruses (KxDG) but is related to the murine rotavirus SA-11 VP3 protein sequence and bluetongue virus VP4 (KxT(x)G) (Fig. 8a) . The presence of bulky aliphatic residues (I, L, V, M) following the KxT(x)G consensus sequence was also revealed by this alignment (Fig. 8a) . Furthermore, another motif (YxR) is conserved between the reovirus l2 protein (YVRKN), the VP3 protein of the murine rotavirus SA-11 (YYRYN) and the bluetongue virus VP4 protein (YKRKM). Mutagenesis of these residues might eventually reveal important amino acids involved in guanylate binding or GMP transfer from the enzyme to the acceptor mRNA molecules. This alignment also showed that the reovirus l2 protein shares a higher degree of similarity with the guanylyltransferase of bluetongue virus (41% similarity) than with guanylyltransferase from human and simian rotavirus (22 and 34% similarity, respectively) over these two domains of 32 amino acids.",

This is supported by the observation that l2 is the only reovirus protein labeled by 8-azido-S-adenosyl[ 35 S]methionine, an analog of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (78). However, isolated l2 failed to methylate the cap of reovirus mRNA; interaction with other proteins in the virus core may be required for the protein to exert its activity (74) . A limited sequence similarity was previously found between the central region of l2 and other methyltransferases from viral and cellular sources (79) . The amino acid sequences of different viral and cellular methyltransferases are widely variable but a conserved sequence element, the G-loop UU[D/E]UoxG can be identi\u00aeed; where U designates a bulky aliphatic amino acid residue, o represents a small residue (G, A, or S), and x is any amino acid (80) . The importance of the G-loop in binding of the methyl donor has been suggested by mutational analysis of a DNA methyltransferase, an unrelated enzyme that nevertheless uses S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor for its transfer to DNA (81) . Analysis of the reovirus l2 protein revealed that a sequence very similar to the Gloop, except for the last amino acid residue, is found in the C-terminal portion of the l2 protein of reovirus (Fig. 8b) . This sequence harbors a 36% identity and a 50% similarity with the yeast ABD1 methyltransferase over a 22-amino acid domain. This domain is also similar to other methyltransferases of viral origins (27\u00b141% similarity, Fig. 8b) . Interestingly, our analysis of l2 sequence showed that it also harbors amino acids similarity with 3 additional conserved motifs (UxY, UxxTxxxxD/ExxxxU, ExGxxU) shared by the methyltransferases of DNA viruses (vaccinia, Shope \u00aebroma virus and African swine fever virus) and S. cerevisiae (82) (Fig. 8c) . The l2 protein displays 33% and 46% similarity with the S. cerevisiae and African Swine fever virus methyltransferases over these four domains encompassing 61 Fig. 9 . Alignment of the amino acid sequence of l2 protein from reovirus T3D with segments of viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase proteins. Identical or similar amino acids residues between l2 and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase proteins are shown in bold; residues belonging to the following groups were considered similar: I, L, V, M; [SY T]Y K, R. The consensus pattern is shown below the alignment which was performed as described under Methods. Positions of amino acid residues corresponding to the reovirus T3D l2 protein are also indicated. Abbreviations: U, bulky aliphatic residues; x, any amino acid residue. residue of motif IV to an alanine causes a dramatic reduction of the methyltransferase activity (83) . The signi\u00aecance of these methyltransferase consensus motifs still needs to be established but their presence certainly makes the l2 protein a very good candidate to exert the methyltransferase activity required for reovirus mRNA cap synthesis. Interestingly, a recent study showed that a truncated l2 protein, encompassing the \u00aerst 3 methyltransferase motifs, retains all activities required to add the methylated cap structure found on reovirus mRNA molecules (84) . The methyltransferase domain, being located carboxyterminal to the guanylyltransferase motif, is also consistent with the known orientation of that protein where the carboxy terminal portion is located at the outside of the virion (84) .",

            "text": "Analysis of the l2 sequence from reovirus serotype 3 also unexpectedly revealed a similarity with a region known to be important for the hemagglutination process in viral hemagglutinins (Fig. 9) . This was noted with viral hemagglutinin (HA) or hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins from many serotypes of Sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus, and parain\u00afuenza viruses. Analysis of in\u00afuenza A and mumps virus HA protein also revealed some similarities with l2 but to a lesser extent. Mammalian reoviruses can actually bind erythrocytes and cause hemagglutination (1) . Differences in the ability of the three reovirus serotypes to agglutinate bovine and human erythrocytes was mapped to their S1 genes, encoding the s1 protein (85, 86) . Puri\u00aeed s1 was actually shown to cause hemagglutination of erythrocytes (87, 88) . However, in contrast with l2, comparison of the primary structure of s1 with various viral hemagglutinin (HA) proteins reveals no signi\u00aecant sequence similarities. Previous analysis of a Sendai virus thermosensitive mutant (ts271) provided opportunity to localize a region involved in hemagglutinating activity of the paramyxovirus HN protein (89) . The HN glycoprotein of this mutant is able to agglutinate erythrocytes and infect host cells at 30 C but not at 38 C while its neuraminidase activity is unaffected by the increase in temperature (89) . Sequence analysis of the HN gene of ts271 revealed two closely located amino acid substitutions at position 262 and 264 (89) . This \u00aending suggests that the erythrocyte binding site in the sequence of the HN protein is located at, or close to, amino acid 260\u00b1270; this is actually the region of the protein that harbors most resemblance with the reovirus l2 C-terminal 1238\u00b11250 region and with other viral hemagglutinins (Fig. 9 ). Over this region of 45 amino acids, the reovirus l2 protein harbors a 29% identity and 36% similarity with the HN protein of parain\u00afuenza viruses. A 22% identity and 31% similarity to the HN protein of Sendai viruses was also observed with this alignment. Overall, it is tempting to speculate that l2 could serve as a second viral attachment protein on the surface of erythrocytes under certain conditions. Such a phenomenon was observed in coronaviruses: studies have demonstrated that binding of the coronavirus E3 glycoprotein to 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid on erythrocytes results in hemagglutination while coronaviruses that lack this hemagglutinin (E3) can still attach on the surface of the host cell via their large E2 spike protein (90\u00b192). The localization of the putative hemagglutination domain of l2, at the carboxy-terminal end close to the tip of the molecule and to the s1 protein, is also consistent with its interaction with cell surfaces.",

One conserved region (GDD motif ) was found in various RNA polymerases from singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses (96\u00b198). This remarkable sequence conservation between ssRNA and dsRNA viruses may re\u00afect evolution from a common ancestor or convergent evolution to a highly favored structure. The l3 protein from all three reovirus serotypes harbors this conserved GDD sequence (Fig. 10) . Analysis of the primary structure of viral RNA polymerases also showed that two bulky aliphatic amino acid residues (I, L, V, M) are conserved following the consensus GDD sequence (Fig. 10) . Other conserved regions have also been reported in viral RNA polymerases from many viruses and include an acidic motif in the N-terminal region of the polymerases with two strongly conserved aspartate residues (motif I) and a third characteristic serineglycine motif (motif II) located near the GDD consensus sequence considered as motif III (94) . Secondary structure predictions for motif II indicated a turn at the serine-glycine both preceded and followed by a beta sheet structure (99) . Inspection of the resulting alignment revealed that these additional motifs (motifs I and II) are present as well in reovirus l3 protein. However, the signi\u00aecance of these l3 sequences has not yet been studied. It can be seen from this alignment that the reovirus l3 protein shares many identical and similar residues with these RNA virus polymerases and particularly with members of the Picornaviridae family (25\u00b133% identity and 42\u00b150% similarity) over these three domains that span 36 amino acid residues.",

            "text": "It was recently demonstrated that, in addition to being an NTPase/helicase, the reovirus l1 protein possesses an RNA 5 H -triphosphatase activity (122) ; this activity is likely responsible for the \u00aerst step in the formation of the cap structure at the 5 H -end of reovirus early mRNAs. Few primary structures of proteins possessing an RNA 5 H -triphosphatase activity are actually known. Studies have shown that both the NS3 protein of the West Nile virus and the D1 subunit of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme possess such an activity (123, 124) . It has been noted that the LRPR amino acid sequence found in the West Nile Virus protein is related to the vaccinia virus D1 subunit sequence LKPR (123) . Since no actual structurefunction studies have been performed, the importance of this motif (LK/RxR) remains purely speculative although a similar motif (LRIR) is also present in the reovirus l1 protein (Fig. 11b) . Furthermore, another somewhat degenerate motif (RxxTxL) is present on the vaccinia virus capping enzyme D1 subunit (RPNTSL), West Nile virus NS3 (RTNTIL) and reovirus l1 protein (RDETGL) (Fig. 11b) . These two motifs are also found on various putative RNA 5 Htriphosphatases of other\u00afaviviruses and DNA viruses for which no activity has been actually demonstrated. Interestingly, a substitution of the glutamate residue in this latter motif of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme inactivates the triphosphatase but does not affect the guanylyltransferase activity present on the same polypeptide chain (125) . This supports the idea that these consensus motifs have a functional signi\u00aecance, although further studies will be needed to \u00aermly establish their exact nature and importance.",

Among these motifs, consensus sequences have been identi\u00aeed that are in accordance with already suspected functions of reovirus proteins: RNA polymerase, guanylyltransferase, RNA triphosphatase, and helicase activity. There is little doubt that future functional studies will take advantage of the identi\u00aecation of these consensus sequences that represent putative targets for site-directed mutagenesis experiments. This analysis has also revealed unexpected similarities of some reovirus proteins with speci\u00aec classes of proteins present in the databases. This suggests yet unidenti\u00aeed activities for some of the reovirus proteins. Among most potentially signi\u00aecant \u00aendings are the strong similarities noted between s1 and SF6 lysozyme and the similarity of a short region of l2 with viral hemagglutinins. Further work is obviously needed to determine if these sequence similarities actually re\u00afects functions of reovirus proteins. However, the similarities between reovirus proteins whose functions are known and proteins exhibiting similar properties, does support the idea that sequence similarities, although not necessarily extensive, could re\u00afect actual function of reovirus proteins. Exponential increase in the number of sequences found in databases and the development of increasingly powerful tools for their analysis should certainly further contribute to our knowledge of reovirus proteins functions.",

Identical or similar amino acids residues are shown in bold; residues belonging to the following groups were considered similar: [I, L, V]; [D, E]; [S, T]; [K, R]. The consensus pattern is shown below the alignment which was performed as described under Methods. Positions of amino acid residues corresponding to the reovirus T3D l2 protein are also indicated. Abbreviations: U, bulky aliphatic residues; x, any amino acid residue. (B) alignment of the amino acid sequence of l2 protein from reovirus T3D with viral and yeast methyltransferase proteins. The conserved segment is shown above the alignment and corresponds to motif I. (C) Alignment of the amino acid sequence of l2 protein from reovirus T3D with selected viral and yeast methyltranferase proteins. Additional conserved motifs are indicated above the alignment. amino acids. Mutational analysis of the vaccinia virus enzyme has previously revealed that the His-Tyr dipeptide in motif II is likely a component of the active site since a double amino acid substitution in this motif abolishes the methyltransferase activity (83). Furthermore, a single substitution of the tyrosine",
