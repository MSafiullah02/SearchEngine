            "text": "A diverse range of microbial pathogens can be transmitted from domestic and wild animals to human populations. These include viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, and prions. Strictly defined, not all infectious diseases common to animals and humans are zoonotic, and they can contract pathogens from the same sources, i.e., soil, water, plants, and invertebrates. For instance, acquisition of common human pathogens [Escherichia coli, Enterococci spp.] from animal food source with multiple antimicrobial resistance profile due to the liberal usage of antibiotics in animal feed may not be considered as zoonoses. Zoonotic diseases are due to transmissible infectious agents that affect more than one animal species, including humans, and cause clinical or subclinical infections. The resurgence of zoonotic infectious diseases in the past two decades globally is of major concern. These diseases have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality on a large segment of the global human population, with over a billion afflicted resulting in millions of annual deaths [1]. Moreover, outbreaks of zoonoses have had adverse impact on regional economies as a result of huge financial burden on the affected communities, but also indirectly affecting commerce or trade with more affluent consumer countries from the fear of spreading the affliction to their population. A systematic survey in 2007 estimated that in 1399 species of human pathogens, 87 of which were first reported in humans since 1980, most were viruses of animal reservoirs [1]. The World Organization for Animal Health estimates that 75% of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from domestic or wild animals, appealing for collaboration between animal health and human public health organizations and authorities [www.oie.int/int/edito/en-avr09.htm]. A new strategy to incorporate animal health data to assist public health authorities was adopted by the European Union under the One Health concept [2]. The socioecology of zoonoses is complex and dynamic, and the epidemiology and resurgence of these diseases are influenced by various conditions that can be classified as human related, pathogen related, animal/host related, and climate/environment related [3]. Significant interaction and combination of these factors are usually present.",

Direct contact with animals or carcasses can result in transmission of disease by a few different ways, most commonly by oral ingestion as in foodborne zoonoses, or accidentally from handling pets without proper hand sanitization. Transmission of disease by animal bites, scratches, or mucosal exposure to infected secretions occurs relatively infrequently, such as in rabies and animal-related wound infections. Exposure to animal pathogens can be through inhalation of droplets of infected secretions, as believed to have occurred in China with local outbreaks of avian influenza arising from exposures to infected fowls or ducks in open markets. On rare occasions inhalation of microbial spores or contamination of the abraded or broken skin from exposure to contaminated animal hide can result in infection such as anthrax.",

Only in local outbreaks of diseases can the source of infection be detected by epidemiological investigations, as sometimes found from ingestion of contaminated vegetables from infected manure used for fertilization, as in listeria infection after ingestion of contaminated cold-slaw. Inhalation of aerosolized excreta from infected animals is another means of transmission, i.e., in \u201c cave disease\u201d that occurs in spelunkers after exploration of bat-infested caverns contaminated with spores or sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary disease from unwitting inhalation of rat excreta aerosolized with dust. Infected animal excretions may also transmit diseases through contamination of water used for drinking or bathing or from accidental skin exposure to puddles of water containing rat urine to produce leptospirosis.",

Chagas disease, transmitted by the \u201c kissing bug\u201d [triatomine], afflicted humans as early as 9000 years ago [4]. The causative [discovered in 1909] can be found in at least 150 species of domestic and wild animals; and paleoparasitologists detected T. cruzi DNA from human mummies of ancient times [5]. Vector-borne zoonoses continue to emerge in the modern era, for example, Lyme disease, and expand with greater resurgence as exemplified by the global expansion of dengue fever and West Nile virus disease .",

Although the majority of outbreaks of these bacterial zoonoses\nare related to \u201chigh-risk\u201d foods commonly associated with illness, for instance, pink hamburger, raw oysters, unpasteurized milk or milk products [cheese], runny eggs, and alfalfa sprouts [15], outbreaks have occurred with vegetables, fruits, peanut butter, and raw nuts [16]. The majority of resulting illnesses are usually self-limited gastroenteritis, but chronic complications may include irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis/spondylitis, and rarely Guillain-Barre syndrome. These bacteria\nare widespread in nature and often colonize the intestines of many domestic and wild animals, i.e., poultry, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. Hence, raw meat from these animals are frequently contaminated with pathogenic bacteria during the preparation of carcasses for wholesale or retail in broilers and supermarkets, with poultry more frequently colonized with disease-producing bacteria than pork or beef. The European Food Safety Authority reported that poultry meats from broilers were contaminated by Campylobacter in 75.8% and by Salmonella in 15.6% [17]. However, even higher rates were reported in China with the presence of Campylobacter in carcasses of chicken in 94%, duck in 96%, rabbit in 97%, pork in 31%, and beef in 35% [18]. Salmonella contamination of meats for retail in the marketplace of China was somewhat less, with rates in chicken of 54%, in pork of 31%, in lamb of 20%, and in beef of 17% [19].",

Infections are caused predominantly by E. coli serotype 0157:H7, but novel serotypes are emerging that produces the toxin, as exemplified by the outbreak in Europe with E. coli 0104:H4 [10, 11]. Infections can result in acute uncomplicated diarrhea or with severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome with acute renal failure and death [mainly children under 10 years of age], and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [mostly in adults]. These severe complications occur in about 10% of infected subjects [27]. Infections with STEC are estimated to occur in about 265,630 persons with 31 deaths annually in the US [7]. Outbreaks of STEC infections occur worldwide but the global burden of disease is unknown. There are over 100 STEC serotypes, but most outbreaks and sporadic diseases are attributed to the 0157 serotype. The diagnosis is probably frequently missed as many laboratories only test for the 0157 STEC, without a test to detect Shiga toxin as recommended [28]. Shiga toxins [STXs] or verotoxins are potent cytotoxins, found mainly in zoonotic pathogenic E. coli, and are produced through lysogenic bacteriophages inserted into the chromosomes to encode the genes for six or more STXs [27]. Most STEC disease is the result of STX1 or STX2. Transmission of STEC readily occurs as the infectious dose is low [10\u2013100 colony-forming units], and the bacteria are resistant to gastric acid [27]. The STECs are mainly found in cattle, sheep, and goats, but other animals can be carriers; and infection in humans mainly results from ingestion of undercooked beef or contaminated milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese and rarely from salads, vegetables, and apple juice [27]. The prevalence of STEC in cattle bowels ranges from 0.1 to 16%, and shedding of the pathogen in the excreta is intermittent [29].",

The pathobiologic mechanisms differed from the STEC 0157 infections in the absence of the usual virulence enterocyte effacement locus, characteristic for enteropathogenic E. coli used for epithelial adherence. However, this strain possessed several genes and virulence plasmids typical for enteroaggregative E. coli, carried primarily by humans [10]. This suggest that the STEC 0104 strain resulted from mixing of human and animal [cattle] STEC to produce a recombination of genes in a novel bacteria probably of a zoonotic source.",

The main animal reservoir is the pig, as a pharyngeal commensal [32], but the organism has been isolated in more than ten different types of animals in China, and 32% of the strains were considered pathogenic [33]. Foodborne vibriosis due to non-cholera species is mainly from consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters, appears to be increasing in the US, and is estimated to cause about 800,000 illnesses, 500 hospitalizations, and 100 deaths each year [7, 34]. Vibrios are natural commensals in marine and estuarine seawater, and is the most common cause of foodborne infection, presenting mainly as a self-limited gastroenteritis. , which is associated with soft tissue infection and septicemia, is rarely foodborne [34]. Other bacterial foodborne zoonoses which are rare in North America but more common in the Mediterranean basin and developing countries include Q-fever and brucellosis. Persistence of these pathogens in these regions may largely be related to unregulated animal husbandry.

In the US it is estimated that only 2% of foodborne illnesses are caused by parasites annually [7]. However, T. gondii which is the most common foodborne parasite is frequently subclinical, and only 15% of recently infected subjects are clinically ill [35]. T. gondii is the most widespread parasitic infection in the world and infects half a billion people or one-third of the global population [27, 29]. The parasite infects a wide variety of domestic and wild animals, and nearly all warm-bloodied animals can be infected. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis varies greatly in different countries, which may be related to culinary habits and hygienic standards. Although toxoplasmosis can be transmitted from contamination of the hands while changing cat [kitten] liter from sporulated oocysts, most infection results from ingestion of raw or undercooked meat with tissue cysts. The prevalence of infection in cat ranges between 10 and 80%, and oocysts are shed only in the first 14 days of primary infection [36]. Consumption of raw or undercooked pork and lamb is most commonly implicated in the transmission of toxoplasmosis, less commonly from beef due to a short developmental stage in cattle, but infection can occur from eating raw/undercooked liver, caribou, and seal meat and rarely from drinking contaminated water [36]. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in Central Europe ranges between 37 and 58%, in the US 3 and 35%, in Latin America 51 and 72%, and in West Africa 54 and 77% [36]. Infection in healthy persons\nis usually subclinical or sometimes present with the mononuclear syndrome, but infection in pregnancy and immunosuppressed hosts can produce serious consequences. Congenital toxoplasmosis in the first trimester occurs in about 15% from primary infection and may cause severe complications [abortion, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and mental retardation]; and infection in the third trimester can result in less severe abnormalities [chorioretinitis, epilepsy, deafness, jaundice at birth, learning difficulties later in life] but more frequently about 65% [36].",

Foodborne parasitic zoonoses are estimated to affect about 150 million people in China alone [31]. National surveys in China between 2001 and 2004 indicated that the number of people affected with clonorchiasis, trichinellosis, paragonimiasis, and angiostrongyloidiasis had increased compared to previous surveys in 1988\u20131992 and are of public health concern [31, 37]. is a trematode that can be asymptomatic or cause liver/biliary tract disease in all Asian countries from consumption of raw freshwater fish or shrimps; and it is estimated to that 35 million people who are infected globally, with 15 million residing in China [31]. The cycle of the liver fluke is perpetuated by fecal contamination of freshwater by animal hosts [humans, pigs, cats, and rats], with ingestion of larvae by snails and release of cercariae to infect fish. Eradication and control has been difficult as rice paddies, swamps, ponds, and streams commonly have infected fish [mainly carps], which is a main source of food supply. In some provinces of China, about 17% of freshwater fish are infected with C. sinensis, and rates of infection in the population vary from 4.75% to 31.6% [31, 38]. Despite the common practice of eating raw fish [sushi] in Japan, clonorchiasis is very rare, as the fish is mainly from the sea. The bulk of the infected people with clonorchiasis are asymptomatic, but heavy burden of infection for many years can result in gallbladder and liver disease, cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma.",

Control of leishmaniasis in the endemic areas is a great challenge and extension to non-endemic regions is of great concern, due to increasing travel access of pets across borders. Control measures instituted in Brazil consisted of serologically testing dogs and culling positive animals [47], and vaccination of dogs with a commercial vaccine [Leishmune] has resulted in decreased prevalence in canine and human leishmaniasis from reduced transmission [48].",

Cat scratch disease occurs mainly in children and is transmitted by the infected flea feces via the claws of kittens from scratching. Thus it is a vector-borne infection transmitted from cats with bacteremia to other cats and humans by fleas. Dogs can be infected with various Bartonella species, but their role in human disease is unclear [49]. The infection is usually manifested by fever and regional lymphadenopathy, but rare severe complications can occur such as encephalitis, granulomatous hepatitis, retinitis, choroiditis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis [27]. In patients with AIDS, Bartonella henselae can rarely cause a rash of bacillary angiomatosis with secondary lesions in the liver [bacillary peliosis], spleen, and lymph nodes. In developing countries the prevalence of Bartonella seropositivity in cats is about 27% and bacteremia approximately 10% [39].",

            "text": "There are several tickborne diseases common to both humans and companion animals that are of concern with respect to increased transmission and diseases in human communities. These include borreliosis [Lyme disease], ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis, Q-fever, tularemia, and tickborne encephalitis, found in Europe and Northwestern Asia [39]. However, only a few of these conditions have been documented to be transmitted via contact with pets. In some of these diseases, the pets [dogs and cats] are not natural hosts for the vectors [i.e., black-legged deer ticks], but the animals may facilitate human exposure from outdoor activities, such as Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis. Hence, the pets pose a minimal risk to humans to predispose to acquiring these conditions. Infections in the pets as diagnosed by a veterinarian may be used as a sentinel for monitoring the risk of disease in the community of an endemic area [50]. Dog ticks can transmit rickettsia infection to humans, and dog ownership is a risk factor for acquiring rickettsiosis in endemic regions. Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF] is endemic in many states of the US, greatest in the mid-south Atlantic states and west south-central region than the Rocky Mountain States, but also present in Central America [Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama] and northern South America [Columbia and Brazil] [27, 51]. The main vector for RMSF is the American dog tick\n, in the Eastern US, but in the Western US, it is the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni. Only the adult ticks accidentally feed on humans, but all stages of the tick are infected and the organism is transmitted to the offspring transovarially [51]. The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is the vector for RMSF in Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, and Brazil [52, 53]. Field mice, other rodents in the wild, rabbits, and their ticks are the natural reservoir for R. Rickettsiae, and the dog is an incidental host. Mediterranean spotted fever [MSF], caused by \n, is also transmitted by the brown dog tick from bites or from mucus membrane contact with crushed tick [53]. The endemic areas are found across southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of Asia. Dogs are subclinically infected and are important biological hosts. The prevalence of MSF in dogs in endemic areas can be high, 26\u201360%, and the cycle of the rickettsia is maintained between rodents, ticks, and dogs, with humans as accidental hosts. The disease often starts with an eschar at the site of bite; then progresses to maculopapular, erythematous rash with fever; and usually lasts for about 10 days [27\n[a rickettsia-like organism] causes severe disease in dogs and rarely can be transmitted to humans\n. The vector is the brown dog tick, and human disease with E. canis has been reported primarily from Venezuela [54].",

Transmission of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis by pets has been proposed but not documented to be related to pet contact [55]. Helminthic zoonoses can be indirectly transmitted to humans from cats and dogs, mainly in children. There is concern that dog tapeworm disease [echinococcosis] is reemerging in some countries of Europe and that toxocariasis, from cat and dog roundworms, is still persisting in large endemic areas [56]. Echinococcosis is a cystic [hydatid] disease produced by tapeworms of canids and humans become accidentally infected by ingestion of fertile eggs or proglottids. causes cystic hydatid disease which is a global zoonosis\ntransmitted within a dog-sheep cycle in sheep-rearing pastoral regions. Echinococcus multilocularis is a less common infection but produces a more invasive and aggressive disease, alveolar echinococcosis, and the red or arctic fox is the natural final host [36]. E. granulosus infection is fairly common in the Mediterranean basin and is reemerging in southern Europe endemic areas [57]. The sheep strain of E. granulosus prevalence in farm or shepherd dogs in Italy and Spain varies from 0% to 31%, in Lithuania 14.2%, and in Wales it increased from 0% in 1993 to 10.6% in 2008 [56]. The pig strain of E. granulosus, subspecies intermedius, is present in the Baltic countries, Poland, Austria, and Romania. Home slaughter of farm animals such as sheep and pigs in several of these countries may be responsible for maintaining the cycle of the parasite between farm animals and the dogs by feeding slaughtered animal parts such as offal to the pets. E. multilocularis prevalence is lower in pets and dogs and cats are incidental hosts. However, there is evidence that pet and human infections are present in many areas of Eastern, Central-Eastern, and Southeastern Europe [58]. In Switzerland alveolar echinococcosis has been slowly increasing from 0.10\u20130.16 cases per 100,000 to 0.24 per 100,000 people, and increased prevalence in the fox population of 30\u201360% [59]. It has been estimated that 490,000 dogs in Switzerland are infected with and up to 13,000 dogs in Germany; and in the cat population, the prevalence ranges from 0% to 5.5% in various endemic areas [56].",

Areas of transmission of infectious disease can be in the homes, pet shops, bird fairs, and markets and through international trade. Pet birds are primarily songbirds [Passeriformes] such as canaries, finches, and sparrows and Psittaciformes parrots, parakeets, budgeries, and lovebirds. A previous study in 2007 estimated that there were 11\u201316 million pet or exotic birds in the US [62]. One of the most important bird zoonosis is psittacosis, also known as chlamydophilosis, ornithosis, or parrot fever, caused . Although psittacines\nare highly susceptible to infection and are the primary hosts, other birds can be infected including canaries, finches, etc. Most recognized human infections occur in veterinarians and bird breeders, and owners represent only about 40% of the cases [63]. Clinical diseases vary from mild respiratory infection to severe interstitial pneumonia, and infection occurs from inhalation of contaminated dust or excretion of infected birds. Asymptomatic psittacines and pigeons are the most important source of infection [27]. In a study from Belgium, involving 39 breeding facilities, infection with C. psittaci was detected in 19.2% of birds [mainly psittacines] and 13% of owners and workers. Of the persons with viable organisms isolated, 66% had mild respiratory symptoms and 25.6% of bird owners reported a history of pneumonia shortly after ownership. Despite antibiotic therapy of the birds in 18 breeding facilities, 66.6% were still positive for viable C. psittaci [64].

However, bats are reservoirs for several zoonotic pathogens and may represent amplification hosts for emerging viruses [70]. In the past two decades, it has become evident that bats are important in the life cycle of novel viral pathogens, arising from tropical and subtropical countries and with the potential for global expansion. There are several features of these creatures that facilitate the spread of infectious diseases and novel pathogens: the large diversity of species with different feeding habits, the ease of migration by flying, their nocturnal activity that allows contact and spread of diseases to other animals [domestic or in the wild], and the ecology and social activity in forming large communities that facilitate the potential to harbor and spread multiple viral pathogens [71]. Bats form the largest aggregate of mammals worldwide with over 900 species, and their diversity of diet is unparalleled among mammals [72]. Various species feed on insects, fruits, leaves, flowers, nectar, pollen, fish, blood, and other vertebrates. The ability to fly may in part explain their feeding, roosting, and social behavior. Insectivorous bats are found at all latitudes and bats living above 38\u00b0N and below 40\u00b0S are all insectivorous. Few species of bats are carnivorous or sanguinivorous [blood sucking], and they are confined to tropical and subtropical regions [72]. The nocturnal feeding habit, highly specialized sense of hearing, and ability to capture their prey by echolocation [sonar] facilitate transmission of infection among various mammals.",

There are a large number of viruses that have been isolated from bats, but most of them have not been shown to cause human disease [74]. The viral zoonoses associated with bats besides rabies include Nipah and Hendra viruses, and SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-like virus of bats have all arisen in Southeast Asia or Asia; and the newly recognized MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from the Middle East may also have a reservoir in bats; see Table 2.6.

Available evidence suggests that ecological changes in the environment ecosystems, such as nutrient enrichment, often exacerbate infectious diseases caused by parasites with simple life cycles [75]. The mechanisms include changes in host and vector density, host distribution, resistance, and virulence/toxicity of pathogens. Many emerging zoonoses occur as a result of increasing exposures of domestic animals and humans to wildlife. Predicting the emergence of novel zoonoses will require tracking the general trends of emerging infectious diseases, analyzing the risk factors for their emergence, and examining the environmental changes that are influential [76]. Wolfe et al. [77] estimated that the three main factors that govern the emergence of new wildlife zoonoses are the diversity of wildlife pathogens in a region, the zoonotic pool; environmental changes that affect the presence of pathogens in the wildlife population; and the frequency of contacts of domestic animals and humans with wildlife harboring potential zoonoses. Emergence of a new infectious disease usually results from a change in ecology of the hosts or pathogens or both [76]. The frequency and density of wildlife infectious agents with the potential to cross over to humans appears to be greatest in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where humans are encroaching on large areas of previously virgin forests, i.e., in Africa, Asia, and the Amazon basin. Environmental factors such as global climate change are predicted to result in expansion of wildlife zoonoses, especially vector-borne diseases. The recent emergence of chikungunya fever in the western hemisphere with rapid spread throughout the Caribbean, Southern US, and Central and northern South America may be related to recent climate change.",

            "text": "Human factors that contribute to the emerging wildlife zoonoses\ninclude population expansion, with urbanization of previous forested areas that encroach on wildlife habitat. Deforestation of tropical forests for commercial log industry and agriculture expansion and hunting of wildlife are major sources of increased human contact with wildlife zoonoses. Deforestation and road construction in virgin forests also displace small wildlife reservoir of infectious pathogens, result in dispersal to new habitat, and expose livestock and domestic animals to these microbes and indirectly to humans. This may have occurred in the US where new road construction caused dispersal of the white-footed mouse [ ] which is a reservoir and resulted in expansion of Lyme disease to new areas [78]. Hunting of wildlife is an ancient tradition that increases the risk of exposure to multiple zoonotic pathogens. Hunting for bushmeat involves contact with potential infectious pathogens at several stages: tracking, capturing and handling the animals, then butchering and transporting the carcass, and trading and consumption of the meat. Moreover, there is increased exposure to potential infected vectors while hunting. Africa poses the greatest risk for emergence of novel wildlife zoonoses which may threaten the health of the global population, by adaptation and transmission from humans to humans. Bushmeat trade and consumption and demand in West and Central Africa appear to be highest in the world, four times greater than in the Amazon basin, with about 4.5 million tons of bushmeat marketed for consumption annually or >287 g per person per day [79, 80]. Furthermore, the practice of hunting primates for bushmeat is still a common practice in Africa, which is associated with a particular high risk for crossover infection to humans, especially chimpanzees which are phylogenetically the closest to humans [77]. This is commonly believed to be a major factor in the emergence of HIV and Ebola virus from Africa. Other factors driving the emergence of novel zoonoses from Africa may include the ecologically diverse wildlife in large areas of tropical rainforests, new and changing patterns of land utilization, and the increased demand for bushmeat in urban communities [77]. The reverse pattern of transmission of domestic animal pathogens to wildlife to maintain a large natural reservoir of zoonoses\nis also possible, but transmission to humans would still be more likely to occur from contact with domestic livestock. Table 2.7 shows some of the major zoonoses associated with wildlife\n.\n",
