Although the subjects involved in different epidemics may be different, many can be modeled by the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models [5\u20137], which study the spread of infectious diseases by tracking the number (S) of people susceptible to the disease, the number (I) of people infected with the disease, and the number (R) of people who have recovered from the disease. Three assumptions are made: (1) the total population N=S(t)+I(t)+R(t) is fixed at any time t; (2) those who have recovered from the disease are forever immune; and (3) those who have not had the disease are equally susceptible, and the probability of their contracting the disease at time t is proportional to the product of S(t) and I(t). Based on these assumptions, the SIR model defines a set of three ordinary differential equations for S(t), I(t), and R(t): \n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$\\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} {dS}/{dt} & = & - \\beta S(t) I(t)  \\\\ {dI}/{dt} & = & \\beta S(t)I(t) - k I(t)  \\\\ {dR}/{dt} & = & k I(t). \\end{array} $$ \\end{document}dS/dt=\u2212\u03b2S(t)I(t)dI/dt=\u03b2S(t)I(t)\u2212kI(t)dR/dt=kI(t).\n",

In [11\u201313], the progression of disease spread is characterized by tracking the number of S\nt with a chain binomial model. The number of susceptible members S\nt+\u25b3t (\u25b3t represents the infectious period of the disease and is always chosen to be 1/k) at time t+\u25b3t is a binomial random variable that depends on S\nt and I\nt\n\u03b1, S\nt+\u25b3t\u223cB\ni\nn(S\nt,1\u2212I\nt\n\u03b1), which provides a recursive relationship between S\nt+\u25b3t and S\nt and produces a formal stochastic process. However, the power of these models is mainly limited to uniform and homogeneous populations or populations with infinite size and homogeneous interactions. In many cases, the actual spread of infectious diseases occurs in a diverse or dispersed population. To study the spread of infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations, people usually divide a population into subpopulations that differ from each other. Sub-populations can be determined on the basis of social, cultural, economic, demographic, and geographic factors. Next, besides the dynamics of the internal spread within a subpopulation, the transmission dynamics between subpopulations should also be considered in the study of epidemic spreading.",

            "text": "Network-based epidemic modelling represents a popular approach for heterogeneous populations in which the nodes in the network correspond to sub-populations, and the links indicate the neighboring relationships. Many network-based models have been proposed, including patch models [14\u201316], distance-transmission models [17], and multi-group models [18, 19]. However, these models require knowledge of every individual (or host) and all relationships between individuals, which may be not achievable due to information privacy-related restrictions and the high cost of subject recruitment. To overcome the difficulties of collecting data, researchers have investigated several types of computer-generated networks in the context of disease spread in population-scale studies [20\u201324]. Grassberger first studied the dynamics of infectious diseases that propagate on regular networks using the percolation theory [25]. Recent studies have revealed that many real-world networks, including social networks in which infectious diseases propagate, are either small-world [26] or scale-free [27] rather than regular or random, as thought previously [28]. Because the underlying structures of networks will influence the effect that the dynamics of epidemics will have on them, researchers, such as Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, have made many contributions to critical value analysis of typical epidemics on different types of complex network [23, 24, 29]. On the basis of the mean-field theory, they found that compared with homogeneous networks, scale-free networks are fragile to the invasion of infectious diseases, computer viruses, or any other type of negative epidemics.",

Most of them are based on the classic SIR model. For example, Birrell et al. [40] provided an age structure-based compartmental model with a Bayesian synthesis of multiple evidence sources to reveal substantial changes in contact patterns throughout the epidemic. Besides of the compartmental models, other mathematical models are also used to describe the transmission dynamics [3, 42\u201347]. The chain binomial model was used to calculate the household secondary attack rates to measure the transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic by Lessler et al. [44] and Klick et al. [45]. Yang et al. [46] constructed a model based on chains of infections and used the infection hazard function and survival function to study the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Ferguson et al. [3] and Cauchemez et al. [42, 43] incorporated other factors, such as household risk, within-school risk, and community risk, in the study of infection spread and found out that younger age groups under 19 years old were more susceptible than older age groups. Jin et al. [47] formulated an epidemic model of influenza A based on networks and calculated the basic reproduction number and studied the effects of various immunization schemes. However, this work required that the individual contact pattern be provided. Nonetheless, none of the aforementioned approaches takes spatial heterogeneity into consideration in the study of disease spread.",

By June 10, 2015, WHO had reported 27,237 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases in three countries with 11,158 deaths [48]. This epidemic received extensive research attention on its dynamics of spread [49\u201357] (for further references in the review article [58]). To name a few, Chowell et al. found that district-level Ebola virus disease outbreaks in West Africa follow polynomial-based growth in time instead of the exponential growth that describes the progress of many infectious disease epidemics [52]. Fisman et al. used a simple, two parameter mathematical model to characterize epidemic growth patterns in the 2014 Ebola outbreak [53]. Webb et al. proposed a variant of the classic SIR model with three extra groups, incubating, contaminated and isolated, which can provide a more accurate prediction for the future incidences [56]. Carroll et al. used a deep sequencing approach to gain insight into the evolution of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in Guinea from the ongoing West African outbreak. The viral sequence data can be combined with epidemiological information to retrospectively test the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing outbreak of viral haemorrhagic fever [57].",

Most of the surveillance data accumulated from such systems contains temporal, spatial, clinical, and demographic information. For instance, Telehealth Ontario is a teletriage helpline that is available free to all Ontario residents, which allows those with suspected infections to connect with experts who can assess their symptoms. The records of such calls provide valuable information on which individual from where was possibly infected and by which type of disease at what time. In this paper, we address the problem of modelling disease spread dynamics in heterogeneous populations from temporal-spatial surveillance data. We analyse the role of heterogeneity in a stochastic epidemic model on a two-dimensional lattice. Within a particular sub-population, the speed of spread is controlled by a single parameter, the transmissibility of the pathogen between individuals. Between sub-populations, the transmissibility becomes a random variable drawn from a probability distribution. Our work differs from existing studies in some fundamental ways, in light of the unique nature of infectious disease diffusion dynamics. Our results have practical implications for the analysis of disease control strategies in realistic heterogeneous epidemic systems.",

Second, in many epidemics or pandemics such as H1N1 and SARS, the number of infected people I\ni(t) is relatively small compared to the whole subpopulation S\ni(t). Therefore, we may consider S\ni(t) as a constant to simplify the modelling of the change in the number of infected people I(t), for which we propose the following stochastic differential equation: \n2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$\\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} \\mathrm{d}I_{i}(t)=(\\alpha+\\delta_{i}I_{i}(t))\\mathrm{d}t+\\sigma_{i}\\mathrm{d}B_{i}(t), \\end{array} $$ \\end{document}dIi(t)=(\u03b1+\u03b4iIi(t))dt+\u03c3idBi(t),\n",

From Fig. 5, we can find that the effect of \u03b4, which measures the internal disease spread within each district, varies less than the effect of \u03c3, which measures the external disease spread between districts. In general, the speed of internal disease spread is closely connected with the population density and the external disease spread pattern is associated with the pattern of people\u2019s daily travel. It is well known that Hong Kong has the highest population density in the world, and most districts are densely populated. However, it possesses a heavy heterogeneous traffic pattern, and there is intensive traffic between districts every day. Therefore, the imported infections for each district account for a critical factor in the disease spread, whereas the internal effects only play a very small role in the progression of disease spread.\n\n",

Figure 7 shows the epidemic curves of the three regions with the lowest incidence rate. We can observe that between time slot 34 and 42, there is a sudden rise for the \u201cTSUEN WAN\u201d district. Such a change significantly affects the parameter estimation and thereby the prediction accuracy for the district \u201cTSUEN WAN\u201d. Although the incidence rates of the other two districts also low, their epidemic curves are relatively smooth in comparison with that of \u201cTSUEN WAN\u201d, indicating that the prediction accuracies of these two districts are higher than that of the \u201cTSUEN WAN\u201d district.\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "Epidemic modelling offers a practical means for policy makers to evaluate the potential effects of intervention strategies. To do so, the accuracy of epidemic modelling with respect to the real-world disease transmission dynamics is essential and remains a challenging task due to the inaccessibility of many factors that affect the spread patterns of infectious diseases. In particular, heterogeneity should be taken into consideration when modelling the disease spread in non-random mixing populations. Many methods have been proposed to deal with heterogeneity in the study of epidemic dynamics, mostly using network-based epidemic models in which nodes correspond to spatial locations with reported incidences over time, and the directional links indicate the probability of disease transmission from one node to another over time. However, it is very challenging to determine the network topology. Many studies have used a geographical topology whereas others have used a mobility network inferred from the public transportation network or other sources. How to verify the inferred network topology is another challenging issue because the true epidemic network topology is unknown, and it may vary for different types of infectious diseases for the same population. Furthermore, the neighborhood effect estimation is non-trivial; it involves many parameters (a polynomial of the number of nodes) and requires a large amount of data to avoid overfitting. Such data may not always be available for the inference of network topology. Therefore, in this work, we propose an alternate approach to investigate the spatial heterogeneity from temporal-spatial surveillance data without the inference of network topology.",

First, it quantifies the role of the heterogeneity in the analysis of the spread dynamics of infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations. Second, parameter estimation can be computed very quickly. Therefore, the prediction and the corresponding intervention policies can be implemented without delay in an outbreak of infectious disease. We apply our model on both the simulated data and the real data from the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong and achieve acceptable prediction accuracy. Based on the study of disease diffusion, the model proposed in this work can be extended to study other propagation patterns such as the Internet and World Wide Web, through which individuals form multiple communities in which information can propagate in a manner similar to that of infectious disease. We believe that our work makes theoretical and empirical contributions in many areas.",

            "text": "There are some limitations in our proposed stochastic model. First, it does not consider the epidemic network topology. However, how to infer such networks is another challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, the best way to do so is to use the contact data among some infected patients to verify the results, but such data are not always available and can be difficult to collect due to many issues (e.g., privacy). This issue may be addressed by using other types of data, such as daily commute data extracted from social networks. Second, our proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of only around 80 %. We need to further improve it to allow its full use in real applications. Third, the proposed model is only suitable for the situation in which the susceptible population (or sub-population) maintains a relatively constant size and structure in a region. However, if the number of infected people in an epidemic is large or asymptomatic infection plays a central role (e.g., the malaria epidemic in Africa), the population factor should be taken into consideration in the model. Moreover, for a highly spatially heterogeneous outbreak (e.g., the Ebola epidemic) in which cases may seem to disappear due to reduced transmission in one area while growth may continue or rise in new locales, our proposed model may have problems in capturing these opposite dynamics in different regions. Fourth, because the proposed model is based on the classic SIR model, it only works in the situation in which the number of infected people grows exponentially. We will investigate resolutions to these limitations in our future work.",
