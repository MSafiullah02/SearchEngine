In our institution, COVID-19 tests are processed by the laboratory 4 to 5 times a day, and it takes, on average, 4 hours before results are known. In extremely urgent cases in which a 4-hour wait for COVID-19 results may not be tenable, surgical procedures proceed with the surgical team donned in full protective gear. This consists of the N95 mask, goggles, caps, shoe covers, gowns, and gloves. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are worn if involvement in aerosol-generating procedures is anticipated. Emergency cases include patients with life and limb-threatening injuries (e.g., high-grade open fractures with gross contamination, fractures with vascular compromise or compartment syndrome, cauda equina, or infections such as necrotizing fasciitis). In less urgent cases, patients are conscientiously evaluated to rule out the presence of concomitant COVID-19 infection. When suspicion arises, we should have a low threshold for performing COVID-19 swab tests. In our institution, guidance on the decision to perform COVID-19 swab tests may also be sought from our dedicated COVID-19 infectious diseases team, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is in line with our second principle: patient and health-care worker protection. Within a permitted surgical time frame, we should strive to ensure that COVID-19 swab results are known before proceeding with a surgical procedure.",

Nonessential surgical procedures would include benign bone tumors (e.g., osteochondroma) and chronic degenerative joint disease.

Each step needs to be planned and performed methodically in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings to avoid inadvertent COVID-19 exposure (Fig. 2). Surgical masks need to be worn for all nonintubated patients during the transfer process, and it is mandatory for all staff accompanying patients to be wearing full PPE including N95 masks, visors, or goggles. For intubated patients coming from the intensive care unit, a dedicated transport ventilator must be used. Staff must be mindful to clamp endotracheal tubes when changing ventilators during the transfer process to avoid aerosolization. A specific route that is the most direct and least crowded must be taken from the isolation ward to the OR. This route, including elevators, must be clearly sign-posted and cleared by security staff prior to transfer.",

These ORs should each have a separate air-conditioning and humidification unit with individual atmospheric air inlet and exhaust systems. In our institution, this takes the form of 5 interconnecting rooms of which the OR itself and the preparation and scrub rooms are positively pressurized and allow for 20 air changes per hour. This is aimed at reducing surgical site infections16. The anterooms and induction rooms are negatively pressurized; the anteroom is used for the donning and removal of PPE including PAPRs. Because of the availability of a negative-pressure anteroom, we have elected to keep the OR itself positively pressurized. When a negative-pressure anteroom is not available, it may be advisable to operate in neutral or negative pressure, as recommended by some jurisdictions. Improvisations can even be made to modify existing ORs, as was done locally in Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore during our severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in 200317. All doors that led into the OR were locked and were sealed with tape. Existing pressure-relief valves opening from the OR into the corridors and adjacent rooms were sealed. In this way, the induction room was converted to effectively function as an anteroom and air lock. It is extremely important that orthopaedic surgeons have a thorough knowledge of the airflows within their specific ORs to minimize the risk of infection to both themselves and their surgical teams.",

Aerosol transmission can also occur from exposure to elevated aerosol concentrations in enclosed spaces19 (e.g., during intubation). Staff who performed aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubations were 6.6 times more likely to be infected compared with staff who did not20. In light of this, if there are no contraindications, we would advocate for the use of regional anesthesia techniques. Central axial or peripheral nerve blockades are effective for the majority of orthopaedic procedures and can potentially reduce aerosolization and transmission of COVID-19 droplets, can avoid worsening existing COVID-19-related respiratory compromise due to general anesthesia, and can prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting21-23. After a regional blockade, surgical masks must be placed on patients at all times. Careful attention must also be given to placing nasal prongs under the patients\u2019 surgical masks if sedation is concurrently administered to minimize aerosolization. This further mitigates the risk of surgical teams being exposed to COVID-19 droplets during the surgical procedure itself.",

Laryngeal mask airways are avoided for these patients, given their high propensity for leaking and absence of a closed circuit28,29. These recommendations have been adopted against the backdrop of evidence supporting dispersion of droplets from exhaled air up to 30 cm away with the use of bag valve mask ventilators and up to 1 m away with coughing30.

            "text": "Sporadic reports have emerged raising concerns of the potential airborne transmission of COVID-1919. COVID-19 aerosols have been reported to be able to linger in the air for up to 3 hours19. However, conflicting articles have also demonstrated the absence of COVID-19 RNA in air samples35,36. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends precautions against droplets and contact, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended additional precautions against airborne transmission for any situation involving the care of patients with COVID-1937. The nature of our job entails the frequent handling of power tools such as high-speed drills and hammers and sharp equipment such as reamers and Kirschner wires38,39. Direct contact with infectious secretions, even blood, can potentially predispose one to COVID-19 infection30. High-speed drilling and blood spatters can potentially exacerbate the aerosolization of COVID-19. Although this theory still remains unproven, we would do well to err on the side of caution. Practical pointers to reduce blood and fluid splatter include the placement of transparent plastic covers over wounds when drilling and minimizing the use of pulsatile lavage40. When possible, to minimize surgical times, we should consider surgical approaches and strategies in which we are most confident and with which we are familiar. For some surgeons, this may involve opting for replacement over fixation options, particularly when operating on complex fractures in elderly patients41,42. Replacement allows for immediate weight-bearing postoperatively. This facilitates rehabilitation and minimizes further complications (e.g., urinary tract infections) from prolonged bed rest in patients with COVID-1943,44. When managing fractures (both closed and open), definitive external fixation should be considered given their minimal invasiveness and the relative ease in performing them45-47. The judicious choice of implants is of utmost importance as well. Uncemented implants (e.g., in bipolar hemiarthroplasties) and unreamed nails should be considered given their shorter surgical timings and potential advantage in reducing respiratory complications in patients who are infected with COVID-19 and have respiratory compromise. In doing so, we can potentially avoid inducing further cardiorespiratory insult from bone cement implantation syndrome48,49 and fat embolism during reaming50,51. By taking these precautions, we protect both ourselves and our patients during surgical procedures.",

PAPRs (if used), N95 masks, and goggles are removed outside the anteroom on departure from the OR. PAPRs are placed in a dedicated area for disinfection. All staff should also shower prior to leaving the OR complex16. Patients should recover within the OR itself and should be brought back to the isolation ward directly from the OR by the same dedicated porter team. This is different from the routine practice in which patients are first recovered in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and are brought back to their wards by a common pool of porter staff17. Again, the route back to the isolation ward should be cleared by the hospital security team, and a face mask should always be placed on the patient prior to transfer. Patients should be given regular antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting), hence minimizing potential aerosolization. Fang et al. reported in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine that the consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen) can potentially worsen symptoms in patients with COVID-1952. This is attributed to their increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), which enables SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19) to bind to its target cells in the lungs53. This theory is still highly controversial and is as yet unproven. However, it might be prudent to opt for alternative classes of analgesia when managing patients with COVID-19.",

We need to be cognizant of specific nuances with regard to orthopaedics when surgically managing patients with COVID-19. Among these include the consideration of uncemented and unreamed implants to avoid respiratory compromise, and the employment of surgical strategies with which one is most familiar and in which one is most confident to shorten operative times. In addition to surgical precautions, abiding by strict peri-anesthetic precautions is equally, if not more, important. As orthopaedic surgeons, we are leaders of the surgical team. It is imperative that we familiarize ourselves with the key considerations as discussed, to ensure the safety of ourselves, our surgical team members, and our patients as we battle this COVID-19 pandemic while delivering the most effective care for our patients.",
