This app is CE marked, connected to a secured and certified cloud and validated to detect AF via PPG signals and to provides rate measures during sinus rhythm and AF [1, 2] . A manual outlining the download and registration process of the app was sent to the patient via email. After download and registration, patients activated a 7-day on-demand prescription by scanning a QR code which linked the app to a cloud accessible by the treating physician. The patients were instructed to use the app three times per day and in the case of symptoms.",

Thirty (79%) patients agreed to use the app, six (16%) patients did not have access to a mobile phone or tablet and were therefore excluded, two (1%) patients refused to use the app. During the teleconsultation at 5-7 days after the initial patient contact, the patient\u015b feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In total, 651 measurements were recorded and the quality of just 64 (10%) measurements was too low for automatic analysis. The FibriCheck algorithm defined 398 (61%) measurements as normal sinus rhythm, 143 (22%) as AF and 46 (7%) as sinus rhythm with extrasystoles. The average number of measurements per participant was 22. After each measurement, symptoms were assessed by the app: 77% of measurements were asymptomatic, dyspnea was present in 5%, palpitations in 2%, chest pain in 1% and in 15% other symptoms were reported. FibriCheck information was used for management of rate and rhythm control medication in patients planned for AF outpatient clinic or follow-up after AF ablation.",
