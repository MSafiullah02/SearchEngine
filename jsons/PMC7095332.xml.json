Among such adults, occasional patients have been supported with ECMO while pregnant or in the postpartum period. Such treatments have led to individual case reports only [7\u201315]. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the safety and efficacy of this procedure in pregnant women and to estimate how it might affect maternal and/or infant outcome.",

ECMO was used in 68 adult patients who had either H1N1 influenza or strongly suspected H1N1 influenza [17]. Of these, 10 were pregnant or postpartum, which were described as part of the published cohort [17]. Two patients presented immediately subsequent and were added to aggregate to a series of 12, thereby providing the largest source of information to date on the safety and efficacy of ECMO during pregnancy. Accordingly, we now report on the various technical aspects and challenges of ECMO therapy in this cohort of pregnant and postpartum women with severe respiratory failure and describe maternal and infant outcomes.",

On the other hand, bleeding was common and responsible for the transfusion of large volumes of packed red blood cells and significantly contributed to three of the four deaths.

Such outcomes may be related to the very early use of ECMO, thereby limiting the duration of maternal hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis as well as limiting the duration of ventilator-associated lung injury. Bleeding was the most common complication of therapy and it was the major contributing factor in three deaths. This finding, the concurrent observations that no patient experienced thrombotic complications, that only two circuits required change and that none failed suddenly all indicate that these patients were likely relatively over-anticoagulated during ECMO. This may suggest the need for a conservative approach to anticoagulation during ECMO treatment in pregnant women.",

Patient selection for ECMO and subsequent management of these challenging cases was determined by clinicians based on experience, limited current literature and local guidelines. However, equipment, policies and practices remained relatively homogenous owing to integrated intensive care services and training in our two countries. Our study does not report on the long-term pulmonary function tests of the mothers or the long-term neurological sequelae in the infants. Consequently, these results may not be generalisable to pregnant and postpartum patients who receive ECMO for other conditions. To our knowledge, however, this is the largest published series of pregnant and/or postpartum patients treated with ECMO. It includes the complete experience from our two countries during the 2009 pandemic. The propensity of the H1N1 virus to cause severe respiratory failure in young adults with an increased risk in pregnant and postpartum women [18, 19] enabled us to study a number of patients with similar lung pathology over a relatively short time span. The findings of our study have relevance to the treatment of future patients who may present with severe 2009 H1N1 ARDS in subsequent outbreaks.",
