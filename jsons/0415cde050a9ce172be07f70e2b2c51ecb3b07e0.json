NimbleGen Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) was assessed as an inexpensive, rapid method of identifying mutations in the temperature-sensitive mutant tsm5 of the K181 (Birmingham) variant of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). This genome resequencing approach requires an established genome sequence as a reference. Comparison of tsm5 and the K181 (Birmingham) variant with the published K181 (Perth) MCMV genomic sequence revealed a total of 10 synonymous and 15 non-synonymous SNPs in tsm5 and 14 of the latter were confirmed by sequencing. Thus, while CGS cannot be relied upon to identify correctly all mutations it was helpful for identifying a large number of mutations for further investigation that could contribute to the ts phenotype of tsm5.",

Sequence analysis of genes involved in DNA replication, processing, and packaging identified three mutations: a C to T mutation leading to a G439R residue change in the large terminase subunit (M56); a C to T mutation (P324S) in the alkaline nuclease (M98); and a C to T mutation (C890Y) in the primase component (M70) of the helicaseprimase complex [Sweet et al., 2007] . The significance of these mutations to the ts phenotype of tsm5 is currently being examined. However, while a chimeric virus containing the central portion of its genome (M56 to m138) from tsm5 and the 3 0 and 5 0 ends from the Smith strain of MCMV was still temperature sensitive it was less than tsm5 and now replicated in mice suggesting that other mutations may also be contributing to the tsm5 phenotype.",

            "text": "Clearly, these mutations need to be identified. A relatively inexpensive approach, that is a rapid method of screening whole genomes for changes against a reference genome, is the Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) service provided by NimbleGen Systems, Inc. (Madison, WI) [Albert et al., 2005] . It requires minimal sample preparation as no libraries need to be generated and DNA is labeled with a standard random prime reaction. The entire genome can be screened and mutations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), amplifications, and deletions can be identified. The procedure uses a two-step approach. Initially, putative mutations are mapped approximately as Regions of Interest (ROIs) when low molecular fragments of the test genome (labeled with 5 0 -Cy3) and similarly sized fragments of the reference genome (labeled with 5 0 -Cy5) are hybridized to microarrays comprised of 385,000 29-mer ''tiled'' oligonucleotides spaced every seven bases on each strand of the reference genome sequence (Fig. 1) . Hybridization intensity ratios (reference/test) plotted versus genome position maps possible mutation sites. The second step, referred to as re-sequencing, is when each nucleotide within 48 kb around an ROI is interrogated with eight 29-mer probes, four per genome strand, each probe differing only with respect to the central position (A, C, G, or T) (Fig. 1) . When target DNA is hybridized to these probes the perfectly matched probe hybridizes more strongly than the three corresponding mismatched probes for each strand. The differential signal intensity between the perfectly matched probe and the mismatched probes allows the base to be determined precisely.",

Probes that spanned potential mutations were identified using custom software. Probe sequences corresponding to all possible candidate mutation sites were selected for resequencing. The software was designed to be sensitive to the slightest reduction in hybridization of test relative to control so that 48,000 bases were reexamined in each re-sequencing array, utilizing 388,800 oligonucleotides. Over-sampling of potential mutation sites increases the likelihood of identifying mutations that were not reported strongly by the mapping arrays, reducing the overall false negative rate. Eight probes per base position are generated, four per genome strand. These probes contain all possible alleles at a centrally located position of the 29-mer probe. The length, melting temperature, and mismatch position of each probe were optimized. When target DNA is hybridized to these arrays the perfect match probe will hybridize more strongly than the three corresponding mismatch probes for each strand. This differential signal intensity between the perfect probe and mismatch probes allows the base to be determined precisely. These re-sequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each test line and scanned as above.

Again, two false negative mutations were observed, the M56 G439R and M27 A658S mutations shown in Figure 2 . It is possible that these were missed because it is now evident that tsm5 is polymorphic in at least five loci and therefore contains a mixture of related viruses (Fig. 2) . However, the relative proportions of each mutant within the stock vary with the stock preparation. All except two of the non-synonymous SNPs identified by CGS were single peaks on sequencing, the exceptions being the G to A mutation in ORF M53 and the G to T mutation in m139, but in both the much more dominant peak was the mutant nucleotide (data not shown). This confirms that tsm5 is a mixture of mutants and not contaminated with wt virus. Similarly, passage of tsm5 eleven times in tissue culture did not yield wt virus but a mixture of mutants, the relative contribution of the wt and mutant nucleotide varying with passage as with virus stocks (data not shown).",

False positive SNPs are reported to occur at a frequency of 1 in 100,000-1,000,000 nucleotides sequenced (NimbleGen Systems, Inc.). In the present study false positive nonsynonymous SNPs occurred at the rate of 4 per 100,000 nucleotides (i.e., 1 per 23,928 bp sequenced) in both K181 (Birmingham) and tsm5. In the context of this study these false positive SNPs were easily recognized by sequencing. Of more concern is the lack of sensitivity, that is, the large number (9 in 23,928 bp sequenced) of known SNPs that were not recognized in the K181 (Birmingham) variant. The reasons for this are unclear as a re-examination of the arrays showed no evidence of these SNPs. A similar error frequency may be observed by 454 sequencing [Moore et al., 2006; Roche, personal communication] ; however, this may be improved by increasing the depth of coverage although this would increase costs.",

Little information is available on ORFs m20, M25, or M47 other than that they are tegument proteins found in virions [Katterhorn et al., 2004] . Interruption of M25 by transposon mutagenesis demonstrated its non-essential function both in vitro and in vivo [Zhan et al., 2000] while gene knockout of m143 demonstrated that it was an essential gene [Menard et al., 2003] . Disruption of m141 and m139 severely limits virus replication in certain macrophage cell lines but not in MEFs or endothelial cells [Menard et al., 2003] . M53 is an essential protein that binds to M50 to form the nuclear egress complex, which forms at the inner nuclear membrane and mediates primary envelopment and nuclear egress of nucleocapsids [Lotzerich et al., 2006] . There are several important conserved regions in the C-terminal two thirds of the protein of herpesvirus M53 homologues but V273 is not conserved. As tsm5 lacks ability to replicate to detectable levels in immunocompetent mice, candidates to examine initially include the C to T mutation at residue 22,698 which leads to a non-synonymous mutation in two ORFs, m20 and m21; and the mutation in m139 which produces a stop codon resulting in a carboxy terminal truncated protein of 564 amino acids instead of the wt 644 amino acid protein. MCMV specific genes are believed to have important roles in vivo.",

Furthermore, mutants were then twice plaque picked under agar following temperature shift from 338C to 398C before stocks were produced, the temperature shift being used to enhance the likelihood of ts virus being selected [Sammons and Sweet, 1989 ]. This might suggest that reversion to the wt nucleotide has occurred subsequently in the production of virus stocks and that there is significant evolutionary pressure to change. However, this cannot be proven as the oldest virus stock still available produced in 1990 already was pleomorphic at these alleles (data not shown). It is more likely that the original mutagenized tsm5 virus stock was a mixture of mutants. Several isolates of human cytomegalovirus have proved to be phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous and difficult to clone even after several passages [Dolan et al., 2004; Sinzger et al., 2008] . Furthermore, MCMV is well known to produce multicapsid virions [Hudson et al., 1976; Weiland et al., 1986] . BAC cloning may be a suitable method of [Scott et al., 2005] compared to K181 (PerthR) (EMBL Accession Number AM886412) [Smith et al., 2008] , tsm5 [Sweet et al., 2007] generating genetically defined virus clones as used for human cytomegalovirus isolate TB40/E [Sinzger et al., 2008] . CGS would then be a useful method for rapidly identifying the differences between the clones. Never-theless, interaction between mutations appears to maintain mutant populations as in none of these stocks produced over 18 years has wt virus emerged, perhaps because there are too many mutations.
