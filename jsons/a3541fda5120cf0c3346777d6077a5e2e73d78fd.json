In the course of respiratory infections adaptive immune responses could be significantly impaired.

The population's susceptibly to infection is renewed annually, because of the rapid antigenic variation of this virus. The antigenic variation is due to the accumulation of point mutations in the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). This can lead to an antigenic drift of the virus, which often leaves current influenza vaccines outdated and ineffective. Antigenic shift can also occur due to the segmented nature of the viral genome that favours the emergence of re-assorted strains, in which an entire glycoprotein can be acquired from a different animal influenza virus. Both types of variation represent a critical bottleneck for the establishment of a robust vaccination strategy against influenza. In fact, when an influenza virus with the capacity to spread from person-to-person and a complete new glycoprotein subtype suddenly emerges, a worldwide pandemic outbreak can result [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza vaccines"}, {"text": "The earliest vaccines against influenza were whole cell vaccines obtained in the 1940s by inactivating viruses grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs with formalin.

Three viral strains are selected on the basis of the previous year's surveillance data on the most prevalent subtypes, therefore, vaccine composition may vary from year-to-year.

Furthermore, the global infrastructure would not be able to handle the timely manufacturing and distribution of a vaccine for a pandemic outbreak [4] . One alternative would be to lower the quantity of antigen per dose and add adjuvants to the vaccine formulation, but this needs to be tested in clinical trials [5] . Another solution would be to improve current vaccine production technologies (i.e., egg-derived vaccines). However, there is the limited number of egg producers and viral strains can emerge, which could not be easily adapted to embryonated eggs. To overcome these problems, several pharmaceutical companies have embarked themselves on projects for the development of vaccines produced by growing the virus on cell lines. The influenza virus can be adapted to grow on a variety of mammalian cell lines, including Vero, PER.C-6, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [6] [7] [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 532, "end": 535, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 698, "end": 701, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1277, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inactivated vaccines against influenza"}, {"text": "This strategy would also improve the possibility of up-scaling vaccine production in face of a pandemic spread.

Cold-adapted (ca) virus strains can grow in primary chick kidney cells or embryonated eggs at 25-33\u00b0C, however, they exhibit a reduced replication at 37\u00b0C. The process of genetic re-assortment with the transfer of the six internal genes from a stable attenuated ca master donor strain of influenza A or B to the new prevailing wild-type epidemic strain has been used to generate attenuated cold-reassorted vaccines with the proper level of attenuation, genetic stability and immunogenicity, which show low or absent transmissibility [10] . MedImmune and Wyeth have developed along these lines a trivalent live ca vaccine (Flumist) for intranasal spray delivery, which was licensed in 2003. In contrast, to parenterally-administered vaccines, this formulation triggers immune responses resembling those observed after natural infections [11] . Despite the moderate hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titres observed in vacinees, Flumist showed 92% efficacy over a 2-year period in children, including protection against antigenic variants that circulated during the second year [12] [13] [14] . This ca vaccine also stimulated the production of nasal IgA, as well as T-cell and interferon responses [15] .

This demonstrated that the elicitation of a strong immune response is not sufficient to confer protection against disease, and can even lead to immuno-pathological reactions.

In addition, naturally acquired immunity to RSV is neither complete nor long-lasting, and recurrent infections often occur [28] .

The maximal life span of BM plasma cells is still debated. Only few factors have been identified that control the differentiation of antigen-specific B cells toward short-or long-life plasma cells or to memory B cells [119] . Beside the requirement of CD4 + T cells, the nature of the antigen [197] and the dose are also important. Higher antigen doses, as well as rapid vaccination schedules (closely spaced vaccine doses) tend to favour the rapid induction of short-term effectors, whereas lower doses of antigens preferentially support the induction of immune memory [198] [199] [200] [201] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 288, "end": 293, "text": "[195,", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 294, "end": 298, "text": "196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 519, "end": 524, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 594, "end": 599, "text": "[197]", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 871, "end": 876, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 877, "end": 882, "text": "[199]", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 883, "end": 888, "text": "[200]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 889, "end": 894, "text": "[201]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "New immunological concepts that need to be addressed to optimise vaccine design"}, {"text": "It was demonstrated that neonatal vaccination (priming) and infant boosting might be effective even when pathogen exposure occurs very early in life.

The delay between memory B-cell reactivation and differentiation may limit the ability to interrupt pathogen invasion. Therefore, it is important to establish vaccination protocols in which the population is boosted at different ages in order to maintain the required levels of antibodies. This is particularly important in diseases in which antibodies play a central role in microbial clearance or toxin neutralization. In the particular case of community-acquired pneumonia, we should consider that aging individuals are neglected in many vaccination programs.

Some factors implicated in this poor response are the limited switch from IgM to IgG2 antibodies, impaired complement-mediated reactions and deficient organization of the splenic marginal zone. Vaccination studies performed in newborn mice suggested that limited germinal centre reactions may results from the delayed devel-opment of follicular DC and limit plasma cell differentiation [204] .

In addition, the immune responses, particularly antibodies, elicited in the first year of life after vaccination rapidly decline [203] . However, the problem observed in infants in terms of magnitude and duration of immune response does not seem to affect efficient priming. In fact, the immune memory generated in neonates may be recalled later in life [119] . Nevertheless, strategies to generate strong and long-lasting protective responses in infants are still needed. This is in part due to the presence of maternal antibodies, which inactivate and clear the vaccine antigens, thereby rendering difficult the stimulation of an immature immune system [203] . In addition, the effects of adjuvants reported in adults cannot be extrapolated to neonates [206] . A potential strategy to overcome these problems would be to implement vaccination during pregnancy, to provide the required antibodies by placenta and later by maternal feeding [30, [207] [208] [209] .
