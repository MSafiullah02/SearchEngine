In this paper, we propose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in the newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected people travel to different areas. The numerical simulations exhibit the dynamic system with the external source is more reliable than the one without it, and the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation results with the public data, we suggest that the local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In late December 2019, a cluster of serious pneumonia cases in Wuhan was caused by a novel coronavirus, and the outbreak of pneumonia began to attract considerable attention in the world. Coronaviruses are enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales which are discovered and characterized in 1965 and are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. In humans, most of the coronaviruses cause mild respiratory infections, but rarer forms such as the \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" (SARS) outbreak in 2003 in China and the \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and outbreak in 2015 in South Korea had cased more than 10000 cumulative cases. In more details, there are more than 8000 confirmed SARS cases and 2200 confirmed MERS 2000 cases separately. Although a lot of coronaviruses had been identified and characterized, they might be a tip of the iceberg and lots of potential severe and novel zoonotic coronaviruses needed to be revealed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The World Heath Organization (WHO) designated the causative agent as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was identified by the Chinese authorities. Because Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province and the 7th largest city China and the largest transport hub in the central part of China, it transports millions of people to lots of cities in China and many countries in the world everyday. Based on the special location and transport hub of Wuhan, the Chinese government has revised the law provisions of infectious diseases to add the novel 2019-nCoV as class A agent on January 20th 2020. Moreover, a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented, say, rigorous isolation of symptomatic, suspected person, 14 days of isolation for the people who traveled from one city to another, strictly prohibit the travel in the many provinces (especially the Hubei province), the public transport is partially shut down in lots of cities, etc. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions during the early stage is questionable. So far, there are more than 8000 confirmed cases in Wuhan and more than 24000 confirmed cases in China, and the cumulative confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV from January 23rd to February 4th in Wuhan and mainland China are shown in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b) respectively. In addition, several exported cases have been confirmed in many other countries including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UK, Spain, etc. The WHO has recognized that the mathematical models of epidemic play a significant role in informing evidence-based decisions by health decision and policy makers. In order to determine the impact of prevention and control of infection in different positions (i.e. provinces and cities), the strength and duration of isolation, the value for the rate of recovery, we propose a novel dynamic system with time delay and external source in this paper.
