These techniques include, but are not limited to, viral culture, serology, antigen detection, direct fluorescent antibody staining (DFA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reversetranscription PCR (RT-PCR), and sequencing of certain pathogens (particularly HIV). While viral diagnostics are discussed in detail elsewhere in the text, we will briefly dis-cuss these tests in the context of emerging viral infections followed by a discussion of newer technologies employed in viral discovery. Viral culture provides a semi-unbiased technique for virus identification from patient samples, though this is a laborintensive process and often requires days to weeks to detect viral growth. Many viral pathogens do not grow well, or do not grow at all, in cell culture, and viral detection is limited by the range of cells on which a given virus will grow and the number of cell lines a given lab can maintain. Even when cytopathic effect develops in a cell monolayer, the virus has to be identified by other means (often DFA or PCR). The majority of the viruses discussed in this chapter are diagnosed by other means, though agents such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and dengue can be grown in culture as well [13, 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1460, "end": 1464, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1468, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Discovery and Disease Association"}, {"text": "The other testing modalities routinely offered in a clinical virology lab, or even specialized tests performed at state and national reference laboratories, utilize conserved sequences (in the case of PCR or RT-PCR) or specific antigens or antibodies to detect the causative virus in patient samples. Hence, pathogen detection is limited by the knowledge and judgment of the ordering clinician or the available tests. The increasing use of multiplex testing for clinical syndromes, particularly for respiratory tract infections, will allow for a less biased approach to viral diagnosis but still faces limitations in identifying rare or emerging pathogens [15] . It should be noted that in very rare situations, as in the case of Usutu virus (USUV) discussed below, an unusual or novel pathogen may be detected by testing for known pathogens. In this case, a woman presented with USUV viremia, which gave a low-positive result by WNV PCR and was eventually identified by sequencing [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 656, "end": 660, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 982, "end": 986, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Discovery and Disease Association"}, {"text": "Viral discovery has typically relied on the replication of a new virus in cell culture. Despite the aforementioned limitations of viral culture, this technique remains useful, as indicated by the identification of two novel bunyaviruses, Huaiyangshan virus (HYSV, also known as severe fever with [17, 18] A number of more rapid molecular methods are now being employed in viral discovery; however, these are typically categorized as sequence-dependent (such as the pan-viral microarray or PCR based on conserved sequences) or sequence-independent techniques [19] . The pan-viral microarray (Virochip) is an array spotted with oligonucleotide sequences representing all known viral pathogens. Novel viruses can also be identified if there is sufficient similarity between sequences in the new virus and those included on the array. Amplicons can be then be recovered from the array, cloned, and sequenced [20] . This technology has been used in the identification of the SARS coronavirus, XMRV, and was also tested as a means to rapidly identify the 2009 pandemic influenza strain (H1N1) [19, 21] . PCR based on conserved sequences is possible but generally has limited applicability in viral diagnostics, as viruses do not contain highly conserved sequences analogous to the 16s ribosomal sequences utilized in bacterial identification [22] . One example of this is the performance of PCR using primer sets that amplify members of a virus family followed by sequencing, as reported in the identification of USUV from patient samples using a pan-flavivirus RT-PCR [16, 23] . The sequence-independent amplification and sequencing of nucleic acids in biological fluids or environmental samples has been termed viral metagenomics [19, 24] . Sequenceindependent approaches include subtractive hybridization or representation difference analysis (RDA), sequenceindependent single-primer amplification (SISPA), rolling circle amplification, and next-generation sequencing. Subtractive hybridization or representational difference analysis (RDA) uses infected and uninfected samples from an individual patient. Viral nucleic acid is selectively concentrated by repeated rounds of hybridization and purification of the unhybridized, single-stranded nucleic acid molecules, which are then subcloned and sequenced. These techniques have been used in the identification of human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) and the torque teno viruses (TTV), but they require large amounts of starting material as well as relatively high virus levels [19, 22, 25] . SISPA circumvents the need for large amounts of viral genomic material. This technique, introduced in 1991, and its derivations involve the attachment of a linker/ primer to blunt-ended nucleic acid and the subsequent amplification of all nucleic acid present, followed by cDNA library creation and sequencing [26] . SISPA was utilized in the identification of HEV, Norwalk virus, and Parvovirus 4 [22, 27] . Rolling circle amplification involves the use of the PhiX29 polymerase primed with random primers to amplify circular viral genomes or cloned fragments. It was used in the identification of human bocavirus (HBoV) among others [19, 28] . Viral metagenomics has been aided in the last few years by the development of a number of new sequencing platforms. Termed \"next-generation sequencing\" or \"deep-sequencing,\" such technologies allow for the rapid and parallel generation of one million to over one billion sequences per run. Most of the current technologies rely on the non-specific amplification of DNA or RNA molecules followed by sequencing by synthesis using different technologies to detect base incorporation [22, 24, 29, 30] . Recently, single-molecule sequencing has become available, and this technology continues to develop, resulting in a greater number of reads (i.e., deeper sequencing) and longer read lengths [30] . These technologies are able to detect viral copy numbers near the limit of detection for specific quantitative PCR assays and have been shown to be more sensitive than microarray analysis (2 per 10 6 versus 1 per 10 5 sequences in one study) [31, 32] . Next-generation sequencing has been utilized to identify novel viruses in patient samples (see arenaviruses below) and determine the cause of fevers of unknown origin [32] [33] [34] [35] . The potential utility of direct sequencing in the outbreak setting has also been shown following the 2009 influenza pandemic [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 300, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 904, "end": 908, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1091, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1095, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1340, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1567, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1571, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1730, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1734, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2521, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2522, "end": 2525, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2529, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2842, "end": 2846, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2930, "end": 2934, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2935, "end": 2938, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3167, "end": 3171, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3172, "end": 3175, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3658, "end": 3662, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3663, "end": 3666, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3667, "end": 3670, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3671, "end": 3674, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3867, "end": 3871, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 4116, "end": 4120, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4121, "end": 4124, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4294, "end": 4298, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4299, "end": 4303, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4304, "end": 4308, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4309, "end": 4313, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4441, "end": 4445, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Discovery and Disease Association"}, {"text": "Deep sequencing, to the extent that it is sensitive and sequence-independent, has a great ability to detect both known and previously unknown (divergent) viruses as well as provide phylogenetic information.

All of these cases involved Old World hantaviruses that are associated with HFRS including Dobrava-Belgrade virus, one case, and Puumala virus, two cases. The renal transplant recipient, 18 months after transplantation, presented with 5 days of fevers, headache, and arthralgia. He developed oliguric renal failure and required 5 days of dialysis prior to return of normal urine output. He was treated with steroids for acute rejection, but given his presentation, he was also evaluated for other causes. IgM returned positive for Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and the patient made a full recovery [207] . The two cases of Puumala virus infection involved a patient with acute leukemia and one receiving anti-TNF therapy. Both patients did well, though interestingly, the patient with leukemia was felt to be infected through a platelet transfusion [208, 209] . The treatment of hantavirus infections remains largely supportive. There is limited data for the use of ribavirin, which decreased mortality in a study of HFRS in China, reported in 1991 [210] . A trial of ribavirin in HPS was terminated early due to slow patient accrual. This study showed no improvement in the patients given ribavirin, though it was underpowered [211] .
