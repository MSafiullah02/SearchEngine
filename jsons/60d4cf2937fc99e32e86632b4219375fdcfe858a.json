Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.

Two types of snakes, containing B. multicinctus (many-banded krait) and N. atra (Chinese cobra) were used for RSCU analysis. Squared Euclidean distance between the 2019-nCoV and B. multicinctus is 13.54. The distance between the 2019-nCoV and another snake N. atra is 16.69. The distance between the 2019-nCoV and Rhinolophus sinicus is 23.46.

These data suggest that the 2019-nCoV might more effectively use snake's translation machinery than that of other animals. Two types of snakes are common in Southeastern China including the city of Wuhan (Figure 4).

Our results show that the novel coronavirus sequence obtained from the viral pneumonia outbreak occurring in the city of Wuhan forms a separate group that is highly distinctive to SARS-CoV.The SARS-CoV first emerged in China in 2002 and then spread to 37 countries/regions in 2003 and caused a travel-related global outbreak with 9.6% mortality rate.26 More importantly, results from our analysis reveal a homologous recombination may occurred between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus within the viral spike glycoprotein gene. Sequence homology analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein genes (1-783 bp) from the 2019-nCoV was done through BLAST at the NCBI website. Interestingly, no similar sequence was found with known sequence in the database, suggesting that a putative recombination parent virus was still unknown. Previous study suggested that the recombination of SARS in the spike glycoprotein genes might have mediated the initial cross-species transmission event from bats to other mammals.27 Bootscanning plot analysis (data not shown) suggested that the major parents of the 2019-nCoV originated from Clade A (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) but formed a monophyletic cluster different from them.

This might be due to the recombination occurred within the receptor-binding glycoprotein. However, there is a concern about its adaptation in humans that may acquire the capability to replicate more efficiently and spread more rapidly via close person-person contact.In summary, results derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and has most similar codon usage bias with snake. Additionally, a homologous recombination may occured within the viral receptor-binding spike glycoprotein, which may determine cross-species transmission. These novel findings warrant future investigation to experimentally determine if Note: The most preferred codons are in bold.
