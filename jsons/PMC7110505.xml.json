Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that encode the structural Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as non-structural proteins [1]. The 1255 amino acid (aa) viral S protein mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion. The S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV are defined, although the S protein of SARS-CoV does not appear to be cleaved [2], [3]. The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, located between residue 318 and 510 of the S1 domain [4], interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been identified as the SARS-CoV receptor [5].",

Convalescent serum has been reported to contain high titers of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV [6], suggesting that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies could be useful for passive immunization against SARS. Among the different protein candidates recognized by the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the S protein has emerged as a major target for vaccine development [7]. In particular, the RBD of S1 contains important epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, although a neutralizing mAb that recognizes the S1 N-terminal region (aa 130\u2013150) was also reported [8]. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV infection could be inhibited by interfering with the interaction between S1 and ACE2, and specifically the binding of ACE2 with the RBD of S1.",

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) gp41 virus was neutralized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognized epitopes proximal to the viral membrane [10]. Similarly, antibodies targeting the membrane-anchoring or HR2 domain in the S2 region were able to neutralize SARS-CoV [11], [12], [13]. Furthermore, many neutralizing epitopes mapped to the S2 region were identified in the antisera of convalescent SARS patients [14]. Together this indicates that SARS-CoV can be neutralized by antibodies that target either the S1 or S2 domains.",

SKOT19 stained the surface of S6.2 cells only marginally, whereas the staining signals obtained with SKOT3 and SKOT20 were stronger (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Importantly, these signals were substantially enhanced by combining SKOT3 and SKOT19 or SKOT19 and SKOT20 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Of note, we previously showed that S expression in S6.2 cells was detectable at high levels using a mixture of all anti-S mAbs [17]. To further define the epitopes targeted by the mAbs, we next performed competition experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C, binding of SKOT-3 to virion was not inhibited either by SKOT19 or SKOT20, whereas binding of SKOT19 and SKOT20 was partially inhibited by each other and also by SKOT3. Together this indicated that the mAbs recognize two distinct epitopes of S protein, one epitope recognized by SKOT3 and the other by SKOT19 and SKOT20.

In this study, we further characterized three mAbs (SKOT3, SKOT19 and SKOT20) that possessed strong neutralization activity but different affinities towards the S protein. Immunofluorescence assays indicated that these mAbs reacted similarly to the cytoplasmic and ER/Golgi membranes of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, but did not recognize purified virion that was blotted onto a membrane [16]. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that three mAbs recognize distinct conformational epitopes of S protein. Furthermore, the competition assay using these mAbs indicated that the epitope recognized by SKOT3 and that by SKOT19 and SKOT20 do not overlap. We generated neutralization escape viral mutants against these mAbs, and detected substitutions at positions 442 and 601 in the S1 domain, as well as 757 and 834 in the S2 domain, indicating that the major antigenic determinants of SKOT3 include aa 757 in the S2 domain, whereas those of SKOT19 and SKOT20 include aa 442 in the S1 RBD. We speculate that SKOT19 and SKOT20 may block virus entry by interfering with the interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor.

In fact, some neutralizing epitopes were localized in the HR2-containing region [11], [12] and a further N-terminal region in S2 (aa 803\u2013828) [13]. Of note, the neutralizing titers of murine mAbs recognizing aa 1091\u20131192 ranged from 13 to approximately 100 \u03bcg/ml [12], which is a similar level to that observed for SKOT3. Although the D757N and A834V substitutions in v3 and v20-4, respectively, do not correspond to residues in the HR2 domain, our data is consistent with others in suggesting that a critical determinant for neutralization is present also in the S2 region.",

Thus, passive immunization with neutralizing antibody could be an effective SARS therapy. Human mAbs have been developed using a variety of techniques, and similar to the findings with murine mAbs, many of the epitopes were located in the RBD (review in [7]). In this context, Coughlin et al. immunized the XenoMouse, in which mouse immunoglobulin genes are replaced with human genes, with baculovirus-derived S protein to produce various human mAbs with neutralizing activity [25]. Twenty-seven reacted to a variety of epitopes within the S1 domain, whereas an additional 57 mAbs did not. Three mAbs that reacted with the HR2 domain did not exhibit neutralizing activity. Importantly, recently developed human neutralizing mAbs are potently cross-reactive to many clinical isolates, including zoonotic viruses [26], [27].",

Recently, Rockx et al. extensively characterized 23 human mAbs and identified at least six distinct neutralizing profiles in S proteins with respect to specificity to various human and zoonotic isolates [26]. The authors identified several escape mutant viruses from the broad-spectrum mAbs. Surprisingly, all the escape variants had a single amino acid substitution: a single escape variant against one mAb with an L443R substitution, and two escape variants, with T332I and K333N mutations, against the other mAb. A combination of mAbs recognizing distinct epitopes worked synergistically in both reports, consistent with our results.",

The virus v20-4 contained substitutions in both the S1 and S2 regions, and exhibited a growth advantage over wild type virus in the presence of SKOT20 and SKOT19, while it was efficiently neutralized by SKOT3, which recognizes an epitope in S2. Thus, we predict that treatment with a combination of mAbs targeting both S1 and S2 could largely reduce the risk that escape mutants will grow. Such a combination of humanized neutralizing antibodies should be effective in the treatment against any potential re-emergence of SARS.",
