However, even if full productivity could be achieved, 20 million facemasks per day do not seem to meet the needs of a population of 1\u00a24 billion in China under a universal facemask wearing policy. Therefore, to control the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government imported more than 2\u00a20 billion facemasks between 24 Jan 2020 and 29 Feb 2020 and extended the Chinese New Year holiday to allow for home quarantine in order to reduce the need for facemasks and other medical resources [13] .

            "text": "A cluster of COVID-19 cases was reported by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in late Dec 2019 [1] . The human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was confirmed on 20 Jan 2020 by National Health Commission (NHC) of China [15] . The peak of the epidemic was estimated to be around 12 Mar 2020, and the epidemic in China has been predicted to end in late June [16, 17] . The number of new cases is expected to decline after the epidemic peak, but viral transmission is still possible, and the need for facemasks will not decrease immediately. Therefore, our analysis covers the period from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020 (162 days in total). To simulate facemask availability in China, we used a mathematical model based on data and assumptions on the production, import, and need. Five user groups were taken into account: (1) healthcare workers; (2) infected inpatient cases, i.e., confirmed cases who are receiving treatment in hospitals; (3) suspected cases, i.e., people with respiratory symptoms; (4) observational cases, i.e., people with history of close contact with infected or suspected cases and are under medical observation; and (5) the general population. We assumed healthcare workers and infected inpatient cases need N95 facemasks while suspected and observational cases and the general population need non-N95 facemasks. We also assumed that when the N95 facemask shortage occurred, healthcare workers and infected inpatient cases would use non-N95 facemasks instead. We considered three scenarios of facemask wearing policy: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy was implemented only in the epicenter (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Universal facemask wearing policy refers to the recommendation of wearing facemasks in community settings [18] .",

The numbers of infected inpatient, suspected, and observational cases between 20 Jan 2020 and 14 March 2020 were obtained from the NHC. Based on the clinical experience of chief physicians in China, we assumed the need for facemasks of each healthcare worker in Hubei province (a1(d)) and in other regions (a2(d)) on day d during our prediction period. We also assumed each infected inpatient, suspected, and observational case, and the general population would need five, two, two, and one facemask per day, respectively. We assumed that 50% of facemask consumption (s1) consisted of N95 facemasks among healthcare workers in Hubei province and 10% (s2) in other regions. We assumed that the percentages of general population wearing facemasks in Hubei province (Pg.h(d)) and in other regions of mainland China (Pg.o(d)) changed as the outbreak entered different stages. In our model, we assumed all facemasks on the market and in storage are available for consumption.

Therefore, we assumed that the daily N95 and total facemask productivity, Fp.N(d) and Fp(d), respectively, changed during our prediction period. According to the MIIT and GAC, China imported 2\u00a20 billion facemasks between 24 Jan 2020 and 29 Feb 2020. The import volume in from March 2020 to the end of June was estimated based on the most recent report. We assumed that 10% of total import of facemasks were N95 facemasks. Facemask storage was estimated to be seven times the daily consumption found in hospitals [12] . We assume that 70% of the facemask storage in the whole of China would be supplied to the hospital system; thus, the baseline facemask availability, Fa(0) was estimated to be 196,805,200 (assuming N95 facemasks account for 10% of total facemask storage), which was about ten times the usual daily facemask productivity in China. Fig. 1 shows the numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, public health interventions introduced by the Chinese government, and changes in facemask productivity from 31 Dec 2019 to 29 Feb 2020. The sharp increase in newly confirmed cases on 12 and 13 Feb 2020 was due to the release of the fifth version of the COVID-19 protocol in which \"clinical diagnosis\" was added into the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 in Hubei province [20] . From the start of the Chinese spring festival holiday on 24 Jan 2020 until festival completion on 29 Feb 2020, daily facemask productivity increased from 8 to 116 million. Fig. 2 shows the observed shortage and our prediction of the facemask availability (total and N95 facemasks) during the COVID-19 outbreak under different scenarios on the implementation of universal facemask wearing policy. Panic-buying and facemask price surges were reported on 20 Jan 2020 right after the confirmation of humanto-human transmission [21] . The Chinese government introduced price controls for facemasks on 25 Jan 2020 [22] . This observation indicated a facemask shortage starting as early as 20 Jan 2020, and there is no clear evidence showing the shortage has been relieved at the time of this analysis (14 Mar 2020). Our prediction model estimated the severity of the shortage between 20 Jan 2020 and 30 Jun 2020. In all of the facemask wearing policy scenarios, the shortage of N95 facemasks would occur on day 4 (24 Jan 2020) and last until the end of our prediction period (with a 2\u00a22 million shortage), except for the period from 12 Feb 2020 to 5 Mar 2020. Specifically, in Scenario 1, assuming the universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in the whole of China, 392\u00a26 million facemasks would have been in F a (0) Number of facemasks available on 20 Jan 2020 Facemask storage was estimated to be seven times the daily consumption in hospitals. We assume that 70% of the facemask storage in the whole of China would be supplied to the hospital system; thus, short supply on day 1 (21 Jan 2020), and the shortage would end on day 132 (31 May 2020). In Scenario 2, assuming a universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in Hubei province (the epicenter), 5\u00a23 million facemasks would have been in short supply on day 4 (24 Jan 2020), and the shortage would end on day 10 (30 Jan 2020). In Scenario 3, assuming a universal facemask wearing policy was not implemented at all, 34\u00a26 million facemasks were in short supply on day 7 (27 Jan 2020), and the shortage would end on day 10 (30 Jan 2020). During the prediction period, the maximum daily shortages of facemasks were 589\u00a25, 49\u00a23, and 37\u00a25 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively.",

Confirmed infected and suspected cases are also recommended to wear a facemask to minimize virus transmission [10] . Numerous studies have reported the effects of wearing facemasks on restricting virus transmission, such as a 3\u00c04-fold decrease in aerosolassociated viruses and lower transmission rate among their close contacts [23, 24] . Thus, maintaining a stable supply of facemasks (especially N95 facemasks) with a priority given to healthcare workers and infected people is crucial for outbreak control [25, 26] . In some East Asian regions, wearing a facemask in public during flu seasons and disease outbreaks is considered a measure to constrain asymptomatic transmission in the community settings and a social responsibility norm for outbreak control, particularly after the experience of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [27] . However, universal facemask wearing was not recommended by WHO [28] . Previous studies found that wearing facemasks may be effective only when combined with hand hygiene, and this combined measure could reduce exposure to aerosolized influenza virus by 6fold [18, 28, 29] . Therefore, to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses, a combination of public health measures is needed, for example, frequent hand-washing, wearing masks and gloves, and isolation for infected and suspected cases [9] .",

However, implementation of these responses was not always timely, and the virus eventually spread throughout the entire country. As soon as the general population began to realize the severity of the outbreak, facemask consumption surged in only a few days, partly due to the lack of information concerning the novel virus and panic buying [18] . Under these circumstances, the Chinese government made several attempts at various efforts with respect to public communication, including updating data concerning the latest facemask productivity, release of guidelines on facemask usage, stabilizing facemask prices on the market, and offering a facemask lottery in official pathways. NHC classified each province unit into different risk levels (high-, middle-, and low-risk) and implemented corresponding strategies for outbreak control on 27 Feb 2020 [33] . This strategy was similar to Scenario 2 in our analysis (universal facemask wearing policy implemented in the epicenter/high-risk region). The experience in China during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that a universal facemask wearing policy should be introduced with caution. In addition, both Hong Kong (with universal facemask wearing) and Singapore (without universal facemask wearing) experienced a slow increase in the number of new cases, indicating that a universal facemask wearing policy may not be necessary for outbreak control [34] . Given that the demand for facemasks can increase dramatically due to panicbuying, a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions may be more appropriate to prevent massive asymptomatic infection. However, without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy, even in specific regions, can result in panic throughout society and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demands for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic.",

Relevant information was limited at the time that the analyses were performed (during the epidemic). Second, we did not consider logistics cost that could restrict facemask supplies on the markets. Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the facemask shortage experienced by the healthcare workers and other user groups. Third, our prediction ended in late June considering the epidemic has been predicted to fade out by that time [17] . However, if imported infected cases cannot be controlled, the end of the epidemic will be delayed; thus, the daily incidence and facemask demand will also increase.
