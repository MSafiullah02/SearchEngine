Lancet Infect Dis 2020; published onlineMarch 30. https://doi.Epidemic curves from Figure 2 of the recent Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 8 were digitised and relevant data extracted using the openly available software DataThiefTM: incidence by symptom onset for the period spanning 8th December until 11th February were collated separately for Wuhan and the rest of China. Information on the agedistribution of cases and deaths over the same time period was also extracted from the recent China CDC Weekly Paper 7 -whilst the deaths were not stratified by location (Wuhan/rest of China), information scraped by volunteers at Imperial College from Chinese provincial Health Commission Reports enabled estimation of the proportion of deaths in China over that time period that had occurred in Wuhan. The observed cases across both locations were then scaled using a number of different adjustments to account for potential underreporting (detailed below). Throughout, we assume all deaths are completely ascertained (i.e. no missed deaths) after the 21 st January, and that no detected deaths occurred before that date.",

Similarly to the parametric analysis, we multiply imputed missing onset times, now using observed onset-to-report times. Likewise, we imputed recovery status to allow for unreported recoveries. For this analysis, we used aggregated recovery numbers by country, which identified that 21% of total reported case recoveries at the country level were not recorded in the individual-level data because they could not be linked to a specific case. For each country, we used the number of unlinked recoveries to impute potential recoveries amongst those with no known outcome, sampling from these individuals weighted by the probability they had recovered given their onset date and the onset-to-recovery distribution from the parametric estimates.",

To capture this information, accounting for our estimates of the underlying surveillance capacity to capture all cases throughout the epidemic, we therefore assume that the current crude CFR in mainland China (i.e. current total deaths as a proportion of the current total observed cases) is a good estimate of the expected deaths arising from cases up to time in China as a proportion of the unadjusted observed cases in this time period: where H is the total observed cases in China prior to time (which is 11 th February 2020).",
