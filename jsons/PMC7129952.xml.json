Slides were dried and fixed in acetone. The conjugates used were goat anti-human IgG, IgM and IgA conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Organon Teknika-Cappel, Turnhout, Belgium). The starting dilutions of serum specimens were 1:25 for the in-house IFA and 1:10 for the Euroimmun kit. Before determination of IgM and IgA antibodies with IFA, IgG antibodies were removed from patient sera by immunosorption with anti-human IgG, using either a Eurosorb kit (Euroimmun) with the commercial IFA assay, or a Gullsorb kit (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) with the in-house assay. The cut-off values for a positive result were 1:25 for the in-house IFA and 1:10 for the commercial IFA kit [2,10].",

First, although previous reports have indicated that specific IgG is not detected in SARS patients until days 7\u20139 of the disease [2,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], the present study showed clearly that IgG seroconversion can start as early as 4 days after the onset of illness. Second, in contrast to the profiles of antibody responses against acute virus infections, and a previous finding on humoral immunity (IgG and IgM) to SARS [9], a simultaneous or earlier IgG response against SARS-CoV TW1, compared with IgM or IgA, was observed. This indicates that detection of IgM or IgA would not provide earlier evidence for SARS-CoV infection than detection of IgG. Third, the study showed the presence of low levels of IgM and IgA at 100 days after the onset of illness, although a previous study showed the disappearance of IgM after 12 weeks [14]. Fourth, the presence of underlying disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic hepatitis B virus carriage) and the use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents did not influence the dynamics of the antibody response (i.e., the times required to achieve seroconversion and peak antibody levels) [2]. Finally, the presence of high levels of specific IgG and NT antibodies to SARS-CoV in the late 3convalescent stage (2 to at least 3 months after the onset of illness) suggests that passive immunisation with convalescent plasma or concentrated SARS-CoV IgG antibody from recovered SARS patients might be an option for the treatment of SARS.",

            "text": "The reason for a simultaneous or slightly earlier IgG response is unclear. The time at which these isotypes were detected might depend more on the test employed than the actual timing of the IgMto-IgG switch. Theoretically, this should not happen if these patients had a true primary response to SARS, and should be accelerated if it was a secondary response. One possibility is that some patients were infected with SARS-CoV before the documented febrile episodes during the epidemic. This is difficult to exclude, but is extremely unlikely. A previous study of emergency room workers revealed a similar antibody subclass response in two patients with mild symptoms (fever with body temperature < 38.3\u00b0C) and one asymptomatic worker [10]. Alternatively, the observation could reflect the low sensitivity of IFA assays for the detection of IgM or IgA. It is known that detection of IgM or IgA without the separation of IgG yields higher rates of false-positive and false-negative results. In the present study, IgG was absorbed before detection of IgM and IgA in two different IFA assays. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the IgM and IgA assays after IgG absorption, rather than the biology of the host response, might contribute to this phenomenon. Therefore, the serological response of SARS-CoV-infected patients might need to be examined with the use of more sensitive methods or different antigens.",

However, in the present study, patients whose pulmonary condition improved after corticosteroid therapy had similar IgG profiles to patients who later developed respiratory failure necessitating ventilator support. An over-exuberant host response, as well as other immunopathological processes, might contribute to a worsening of disease and progressive lung damage.",
