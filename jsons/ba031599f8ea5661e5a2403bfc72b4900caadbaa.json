Cancer survivors who enrolled in a retreat completed online questionnaires prior to and 3 months post to assess health-related quality of life, physical activity, and psychosocial variables; perceived stress, depression, and self-esteem. Paired t tests were utilized to compare changes pre and 3 months post the retreat. The majority of the 51 cancer survivors were female with a mean age of 53. The mental component summary of health-related quality of life (p < 0.016) and physical activity score (p = 0.048) was significantly improved at follow-up, while the physical component summary of health-related quality of life was not (p = 0.139). In addition, participants showed an improvement in psychosocial variables of self-esteem (p = 0.016) and depression (p = 0.016) after 3 months but did not show a significant improvement in perceived stress (p = 0.054). Improvements were seen following a Knights Cabin Cancer retreat in mental health-related quality of life and physical activity as well as some psychosocial variables. Further research is needed to evaluate the individual program components and the sustainability of the program in the community.",

During the weekend, attendees can participate in guided hikes, yoga, classes on nutrition, physical activity, stress, sleep management techniques, and facilitated workshops on behavior change and habit formation. All programming is evidence based, taught by experts in the area, and based on the theory of behavior change.

The retreat begins with an introduction to behavior change using the theory of planned behavior due to its extensive research with cancer survivors [9] . Over the course of a weekend retreat, cancer survivors and their supporters are engaged in education on physical activity and nutrition, sleep hygiene, mindfulness workshops, stress management, and participate in activities such as yoga and hiking. All activities are done as a group with survivors and their supporters following a detailed schedule that factors in time for both educational and participatory events as well as leisure time, time blocks for educational components, and participatory events average 90 min (Table 1 ). All education provided is based on current evidence-based guidelines in the field of oncology and presented by volunteers with expertise in the area such as yoga instructors, certified exercise physiologists, dieticians, and sleep experts. At the end of the retreat, cancer survivors engage in a goal-setting workshop focusing on health habit change based on influencing different constructs of the theory of planned behavior such as social support or physical activity enjoyment. Individuals primarily chose to plan their health behavior changes around physical activity due to the emphasis placed on the importance of physical activity in cancer survivorship.",

The validity and reliability of the SF-36 has been established in cancer survivors [26] revealing Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient for all subscales ranging from 0.60 to 0.85, test-retest scores from 0.81 to 0.93, and validity coefficients of \u2265 0.61 for all subscales. Three scales were used to measure the psychosocial variables: perceived stress was assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale [27] which has a Cronbach's \u03b1 of 0.87 and a test-retest reliability score of 0.86 [28] . Self-esteem was assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [29] which has a Cronbach's \u03b1 and test-retest of 0.88 and a construct validity of 0.46 to 0.71 [30] . Depression was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale [31] . In an evaluation with a cancer population, the CES-D had a Cronbach's \u03b1 of 0.89 and a test-retest score of 0.57. The correlations between the CES-D and other depressive assessments were between 0.65 and 0.77 [32] .",

Cancer survivors also showed an increase in physical activity and self-esteem and a reduction in depression (depression scores were only indicative of mild depression prior to the retreat). This suggests that Knights Cabin Cancer retreats are successful in improving physical activity and can have a positive impact on elements of cancer survivor health-related quality of life and psychosocial health which aligns with our hypothesis. These results are consistent with other behavioral lifestyle interventions that improve physical activity behavior among cancer survivors which have shown improved health outcomes [33, 34] . To our knowledge, Knights Cabin offers a lifestyle approach that is unique due to its retreat format that allows for built-in social support while incorporating broader health behaviors. The improvement in physical activity reported after a Knights Cabin Cancer retreat suggests an increased interest, and short-term adherence, to apply knowledge regarding physical activity engagement. This is in line with the knowledge that cancer survivors are interested and able to participate in physical activity [35] . It is worth noting that prior to the retreat, the average physical activity score was 66 and considered to be physically active although there was a large standard deviation. A Cochrane review noted that cancer survivors who have greater physical activity participation also showed higher health-related quality of life and reduced anxiety, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance [36] . Although not the objective of this paper, we also noted a significant correlation (p = 0.024) between the general domain of healthrelated quality of life and physical activity score.",

An approach that broadly focuses on stress and coping is essential given the high amount of psychosocial distress that is reported among cancer survivors [37] . Retreat participants report significant reductions in depression (although baseline values were not clinically significant) and improvements in perceived stress, however, are not at a significant level (p = 0.054), suggesting that this broad approach may improve health behavior with a positive impact on psychosocial health. Broad approaches such as mindfulness have previously been shown to improve a range of symptoms among breast cancer survivors that includes the anxiety associated with fear of recurrence [38] .",

We believe there is a greater likelihood of engagement in this program due to it occurring over the course of a weekend allowing for working adults with many commitments to engage in self-care. The effectiveness of unsupervised, home-based exercise programming compared with supervised, facility-based exercise programming has been assessed. Compared with exercising independently, exercise in facilities utilizing group formatting prompted greater adherence, potentially due to the social factors that patients are exposed to [39] .

However, given that retreats are a one-time occurrence, future research is necessary to determine whether regular follow up after a retreat is more effective at facilitating and sustaining health behavior changes. For instance, while we saw a significant improvement in physical activity, it was modest and may suggest challenges in adhering to physical activity programming post-retreat. Future research aims to engage participants throughout the follow-up period to increase the likelihood of successful behavior maintenance. In addition, more information needs to be gathered regarding cancer survivor healthcare needs posttreatment and whether Knights Cabin programming meets the gaps in healthcare provisions. It is also worth noting that the majority of cancer survivors who attend Knights Cabin programming are women with breast cancer, and there may be different outcomes in other survivor populations. It has been noted that while women with breast cancer make up 22% of the survivor population, they represent 60% of the participants in randomized trials [40] .",

The low response rate and missing data is a weakness of this analysis as we were only able to make pre-post comparisons on the 51 participants who completed follow-up questionnaires. One of the reasons for low response rate may be due to not providing sufficient email reminders regarding questionnaire completion. Three email reminders were added in at later retreats which dramatically improved completion rates. In addition, confidentiality was achieved by having individuals use initials only when completing baseline and follow-up questionnaires; however, due to inconsistency in the initials, there was further loss of data due to an inability to match data. Additionally, it should be noted that there were no corrections for multiple comparisons in analysis due to the small sample size. Other potential limitations of this pilot work are a lack of data to provide evidence regarding other health changes that may have occurred between attending a Knights Cabin Cancer retreat and the time of completing a follow-up questionnaire. For instance, participant feedback suggests that there may have been some additional health challenges, such as cancer reoccurrence, which occurred during this 3-month follow-up that could have affected program impact; however, this was not captured. Lastly, there is no comparative control group, and therefore, we are unable to know whether the changes observed would have occurred independent of attending a retreat.",
