In comparison to intravenous route, nebulized aminoglycosides and colistin can achieve significantly higher lung tissue concentrations necessary for the effective treatment of VAP due to MDR GNB [1, 2]. For colistin, this is achieved with minimal systemic toxicity compared to intravenous administration. Demonstration of high lung tissue deposition following nebulization is difficult in humans as epithelial lining fluid concentrations may be in part falsely elevated because of a heavy contamination of the bronchoscope during bronchoalveolar lavage (Fig. 1e\u2013i) [5]. Evidence of high lung tissue concentrations relies on microdialysis [2] or open lung biopsies [1] that can be performed exclusively in experimental studies.",

            "text": "In healthy sheep, high and homogeneously distributed tobramycin pulmonary interstitial concentrations are observed 30 min after nebulization followed by a bi-compartmental decrease, and contrasting with low concentrations after intravenous administration [2]. In pneumonia, high antibiotic tissue concentrations are also observed but are heterogeneously distributed, and likely influenced by the aeration loss [6, 7]. Peak tissue concentrations remain high in non-aerated lung regions, indicating that aminoglycosides and colistin likely diffuse through bronchiolar mucosa towards adjacent consolidated infected alveoli. Both are concentration-dependent antibiotics with peak interstitial concentrations determining bactericidality. Systemic diffusion of nebulized aminoglycosides is substantial, increasing when the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane is injured by a microorganism [1]. The peak plasma concentration is observed 1 h following nebulisation, with a subsequent bi-compartmental time-dependent decrease. Trough plasma concentrations, which determine the toxicity risk, are similar to those resulting from the intravenous administration when the nebulized dose is equal to the intravenous dose plus extrapulmonary deposition (Fig. 1k). In contrast, systemic diffusion of nebulized colistin is weak even in the presence of extensive VAP (Fig. 1j), protecting against nephrotoxicity [1, 7, 8] and offering the possibility of delivering very high doses by nebulization. Measured colistin plasma concentrations result from the hydrolysis of the nebulized prodrug colistin methanesulfonate [9].",

            "text": "When considering experimental pharmacokinetic data, the rationale for adjunctive nebulized therapy appears limited [4, 11]. The combination of nebulized and intravenous aminoglycosides is likely to increase the risk of toxicity. When added to intravenous betalactams, nebulized aminoglycosides do not improve therapeutic efficacy in VAP caused by susceptible GNB, likely because double-antimicrobial therapy is not superior to monotherapy. The addition of nebulized to intravenous colistin increases lung tissue concentrations but not plasma concentrations. Thus, it improves efficacy without increasing systemic toxicity. Compared to adjunctive therapy, substitution therapy markedly reduces colistin plasma concentrations and decreases the risk of toxicity as shown in a recent meta-analysis [10]. This is the reason why the ESCMID position paper recommended to perform future randomized control studies comparing substitution therapy (rather than adjunctive therapy), to intravenous administration [4]. The FSAICM and FICS also recommended the use of substitution rather than adjunctive therapy in VAP caused by MDR GNB susceptible to colistin and/or aminoglycosides [11].",

Volume-controlled mode should be preferred to pressure support ventilation [14]. As shown in Fig. 1, it is recommended to select specific ventilator settings during the nebulization, to use specifically designed tubings, and mesh nebulizers positioned 10\u201315 cm before the Y piece on the inspiratory limb [3]. Heat and moisture exchanger and heated humidifiers should be removed during the nebulization to avoid hygroscopic growth of the aerosolized particles and a rainout effect in the circuits. Written operating procedures should be implemented to ensure that previous ventilator settings and humidification are resumed at the end of nebulization. The benefit on aerosol delivery far outweighs the additional workload for health care providers.",
