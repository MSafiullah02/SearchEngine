Terrorist activities involving chemical agents, small arms, explosive or incendiary devices, or nuclear or radiological weapons are likely to be recognized by first responders such as the police, fire department, emergency medical service (EMS) or Hazardous Material (Hazmat) personnel at the point of attack. The morbidity and mortality caused by these agents are essentially limited to the area in which they are dispersed with secondary effects expected among first responders and in healthcare facilities to which victims are transported.",

Initial recognition of disease caused by bioterrorist activity will most likely be by medical personnel in emergency departments, clinics, or private practices some days or weeks after release of the agent. Outbreaks of disease caused by bioterrorist activity [8] may initially present similar to many common and naturally occurring outbreaks such as influenza, resulting in further delay in the recognition of the event for what it is. Properties of certain biological agents of terrorism (e.g., smallpox, pneumonic plague, and viral hemorrhagic fevers) include person-to-person transmission. The potential for a sustained outbreak with widespread cases can be great, therefore, unless appropriate interventions that contain the outbreak are implemented. The potential for delayed recognition and response with subsequent dire consequences is substantial. There are many biological agents considered potential bioweapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed three categories of biological agents, prioritized as to their potential of bioterrorist use and the severity of disease they may produce (Box 1).",

Recognition of disease and outbreaks due to either naturally occurring or intentional release of infectious pathogens has depended on astute healthcare providers contacting the appropriate public health agency at the point of initial recognition of cases [1, 2, 9] . For example, if the astute physician in Florida who recognized and reported the initial inhalational anthrax case in the 2001 anthrax outbreak [6] had not either identified or reported the case, it may have delayed recognition of the outbreak for several weeks. This would have delayed implementation of infection control interventions in the affected mail facilities, United States Senate office building, and other contaminated buildings resulting in possible increased morbidity and mortality due to anthrax.",

Surveillance systems are developed to monitor and disseminate information on many different health-related events involving infectious diseases, chronic diseases, environmental and occupational health, birth defects and injury control. Surveillance for bioterrorist-related disease outbreaks is a component of surveillance for infectious diseases. Fundamental infectious diseases surveillance in the United States has been well established for years, however, surveillance for disease and injury associated with other terroristrelated activity, such as the intentional release of toxic chemical agents and detonation of radiological devices, has not received the same attention. While some disease related to other terrorist activity may be captured in surveillance for bioterrorist activity (e.g., toxic injury due to ricin), systems will have to be designed with these events in mind. Surveillance systems maintained for infectious diseases of public health importance include communicable diseases with epidemic potential, vaccine-preventable diseases, emerging infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, hospital-acquired infections, tuberculosis, foodborne infectious diseases, antimicrobial-resistant organisms among others. While methods for conducting public health surveillance may differ considerably by program and disease, the general flow of data and information through a surveillance system is schematically represented in Fig. 13 .1.",

Reporting of these infections is required by international regulation [2, 11] . The legal basis requiring reporting of notifiable diseases varies by state, as does the authority for determining which cases are reportable [2, 11] . Depending on the state, reporting of notifiable diseases may be mandated by the legislature, state health officer or epidemiologist, the board of health or some combination thereof [2, 12, 13] . Most states require reporting of all notifiable conditions recommended by CSTE and many have included diseases not included in the NNDSS. For instance, smallpox was removed from the NNDSS list of notifiable diseases in 1988 due to the declared eradication of the disease by the World Health Assembly in 1980; however, most states have reinstituted mandatory reporting of smallpox because of concerns of its use as a bioweapon. The Infectious Disease Committee of the CSTE has since recommended that smallpox be placed under surveillance by all states, territories, and the CDC as part of NNDSS [14] . In addition, many states mandate the reporting of outbreaks due to any pathogen regardless of inclusion in the NNDSS list of notifiable infectious diseases.",

The project developed computer programs using existing disease surveillance systems to transmit data to the CDC on all nationally notifiable diseases. In 1985, the system became a fully interactive computer-based reporting system. By 1989, all 50 states were participating and the project was renamed the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS) [15, 16] . De-identified data is transmitted weekly from all 50 state health departments as well as from New York City, Washington D.C., and five US Territories.",

In 1993, the CDC/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Steering Committee on Public Health Information and Surveillance System convened to implement a major initiative for the creation of integrated public health surveillance and health information systems. Their recommendations are documented in the 1995 report, Integrating Public Health Information and Surveillance Systems [18] . Subsequently, the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) initiative was developed and is currently in the process of being implemented. While NETSS addressed the issue of electronic data transfer from the state level to the CDC, NEDSS has expanded the scope of the initial initiative to include the integration of all related surveillance systems at the local, state and federal level through innovative electronic and information technology. NEDSS ''promotes the use of data and information system standards to advance the development of efficient, integrated, and interoperable surveillance systems at federal, state and local levels [19] .'' The long-term objective of NEDSS [20] is to facilitate development of complementary electronic information systems that automatically gather health data from a variety of sources on a real-time basis as well as facilitate the monitoring of the health of communities. NEDSS will also assist in the ongoing analysis of trends and detection of emerging public health problems and provide information for setting public health policy. The NEDSS architecture will eventually replace the NETSS reporting format. NEDSS currently resides within the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) [21] initiative and serves as its public health surveillance component.",

For example, the authors of this chapter work with the Communicable Diseases Division (CDD) of the Department of Health and Human Services of Newark, New Jersey (NDHHS). Newark is a city of approximately 250,000 residents in a metropolitan area of several million people located about 15 miles from downtown New York City. The residents of Newark are ethnically diverse with a substantial immigrant population. A significant portion of the population exists under the poverty level. All the public health problems found in urban areas are experienced by the city. There are tens of thousands commuters in the city throughout the week including 40,000 students attending the colleges, universities, and graduate schools. In addition, Newark Liberty Airport that services 32 million passengers a year, including 8 million international travelers, and the Port of Newark, one of the largest ports for container ships in the United States, are located within city boundaries. In addition, many vital roadways essential for the nation's commercial transport pass through the city. The potential for bioterrorist activity is great. The CDD of NDHHS manages infectious disease surveillance activities, including surveillance for bioterrorism. Despite funding for biodefense activities, the CDD remains understaffed and financially stressed to meet its' routine, non-terrorist-related public health responsibilities. A case can be made that the advent of substantial funding sources dedicated to bioterrorist-related activity has extended the preexisting public health resources and divided attention from foundation public health issues. For example, during the smallpox vaccination campaign in early 2003, much of the public health workforce were furloughed from their usual duties to meet the demands required from the campaign leaving their usual responsibilities unfulfilled. The challenge is to develop and maintain surveillance capabilities that meet the daily needs of the community (e.g., vaccinepreventable infectious diseases, foodborne disease outbreaks, etc.) and are flexible enough to detect bioterrorist events. To meet this challenge the CDD/ NDHHS formed an Office of Surveillance and Prevention (OSP) under the direction of the local Health Officer located at the NDHHS. Using state biodefense funding, a fulltime epidemiologist was hired for the OSP and a cooperative consultative arrangement was reached with the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health (DPMCH)/University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)/New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) and UMDNJ School of Public Health (SPH). This arrangement provides the CDD/NDHSS with additional expertise in surveillance, epidemiology, infectious diseases, and chemical toxins that it was not able to afford to directly employ. Examples of OSP surveillance activities will follow in this chapter.",

Recognition of suspected specific diagnosis (e.g., anthrax, plague, or smallpox), however, by frontline providers is difficult due to unfamiliarity with the syndromes associated with these agents or their similarity with the prodromal presentation of other naturally occurring infections.

Serologic evidence is usually not present at initial presentation. Other molecular diagnostic tools, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can significantly shorten the turnaround time in obtaining microbiologic confirmation of a diagnosis. These testing modalities, however, are often not available at a local level, especially for uncommon pathogens and may not be ordered if available due to their expense if a common pathogen is the suspected etiologic agent. The situation is more difficult for laboratory identification of disease due to chemical toxins for which laboratory access is even more difficult and less widely used than for identification of infectious agents. Furthermore, outbreaks are often difficult to appreciate on the provider level and require a greater perspective (e.g., local community, city, regional, state(s), and nation) for recognition. For example, the extent of a recent outbreak of hepatitis A in western Pennsylvania was not recognized until review on a state level [30, 31] . Lack of awareness of reporting responsibilities by those required to report, including the what, when, whom, and how to report, as well as the ease of contact (availability of contact numbers, computer access, or forms) further exacerbate delay in reporting.",

One study [33] evaluated passive versus active surveillance in identifying cases of hepatitis A in Kentucky over a 22-week period. The report demonstrated that nine more cases were identified through the active surveillance system. This resulted in the prevention of an estimated additional seven cases through administration of prophylaxis to the contacts of the nine case-patients.

Problems identified included lapses in reporting due to failure or adjustments in data extraction software and lack of uniformity of coding standards between clinical laboratories. Specificity was adversely affected due to automated data extraction errors in extracting culture results if entered in free text, for example, reporting as positive a negative culture result due to the organism's name appearing in free text. In addition, accumulation of duplicate reports, unnecessary reports (e.g., screening rubella serology in pregnant women), and identification of unreportable conditions increased the number of false positives.",

A syndromic surveillance system collects and interprets data on clinical signs and symptoms that precede formal diagnosis in a way that would identify with sufficient probability an outbreak of public health interest, i.e., bioterrorist event. Data collected for syndromic surveillance could not be used in establishing a specific diagnosis in an individual; however, it may detect patterns of disease in a population that would indicate occurrence of an outbreak earlier than a surveillance system that requires a more definitive diagnosis. Reporting of routinely collected data such as ICD-9-coded chief complaints or initial diagnosis in emergency departments or ambulatory clinic settings may serve as data sources for syndromic surveillance.",

Since significant variability in assigning diagnostic terms or ICD-9-coding to similar patients exists between providers and clinics, syndromic surveillance can reduce variability in reporting when collecting data from different providers. For instance, one provider may code a patient who initially presents with clinical signs and symptoms of a LRTI with the ICD-9 codes for cough and fever, while another may code it as an unspecified pneumonia and a third may give that patient a more specific diagnosis of viral pneumonia. If all those initial diagnostic ICD-9 codes were included in a syndromic cluster for LRTI that case would be captured while it may have been missed in a surveillance system requiring a more defined diagnosis depending on the patient's provider. In addition, it would allow capture of the suspected diagnosis earlier in the patient encounter.",

Espino and Wagner at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh compared two syndromic groups to detect acute respiratory illness [40] . One group was constructed of ICD-9-coded chief complaints and the other of ICD-9-coded diagnoses obtained at a later point in the patient encounter. Performance was measured against review of emergency department records. No difference in sensitivity or specificity was found between the two syndromic groups in identifying actual acute respiratory disease.

Means for emergency and routine communication should be maintained and routinely tested to insure reliability.

Discussions have since included diverse topics of significant public health interest. Participants have included representatives from local hospitals, the New Jersey Medical School and UMDNJ School of Public Health, local Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), healthcare payer organizations, the Port Authority of New Jersey and New York (PANJNY), and the Public Health Service Quarantine Service, among others. Topics have included exercises in specific scenarios (e.g., arrival of a passenger with suspected smallpox infection to Newark Liberty Airport), local public health SARS preparedness, and discussion of specific surveillance issues with respect to agents of bioterrorism, influenza, SARS, and vaccinepreventable diseases.
