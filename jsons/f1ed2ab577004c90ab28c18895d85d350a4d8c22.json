Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management.",

Existing research has already proved that the LDA model has obvious superiority in identifying semantic topic information from massive text automatically [16, 18] . Due to their high computational efficiency in both training and evaluation, in addition to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art results, random forests (RF) are frequently used in text classification [21] . The first step was to mine and generalize the topics from the COVID-19-related Weibo sample using the LDA model. Then, topic extraction results were utilized as training samples for the RF algorithm to classify the Weibo data. As shown in Figure 1 , the COVID-19-related Weibo texts were generalized into seven topics: \"events notification\", \"popularization of prevention and treatment\", \"government response\", \"personal response\", \"opinion and sentiments\", \"seeking help\", and \"making donations\". A secondary classification was implemented to divide \"personal response\", \"opinion and sentiments\", and \"seeking help\" into 13 more detailed sub-topics, including \"fear and worry\", \"questioning the government and media\", \"condemning bad habits\", \"objective comment\", \"taking scientific protective measures\", \"blessing and praying\", \"appealing for aiding patients\", \"willing to return work\", \"staying at home and taking necessary precautions\", \"popularizing anti-epidemic knowledge in family\", \"seeking medical help\", \"seeking relief materials\", and \"other\". The processes of topic extraction and classification are shown in Figure 2 , including the steps of word segmentation and topic extraction using the LDA and RF models.

Split by day, it shows that the lowest point of the Weibo number on the curve for each day appeared at 06:00, after which the curve began to rise sharply. Figure 3b shows part of the cyclical change in the number of COVID-19-related Weibo posts. The lowest point of cyclical change occurred at 06:00 every day, with two daily peaks around 11:00 and 23:00. Figure 3c shows the seasonally adjusted time series, which shows the trend of the number of COVID-19-related Weibo texts after eliminating the seasonal factor. Figure 3d shows the trend component reflecting the trends of the number of COVID-19 related Weibo. After COVID-19 occurred, a slight increase appeared for a short time, then the amount increased sharply on 20 January. The fluctuation reached a peak on 21 January, and then began to decrease but fluctuated until 29 January. The curve rose obviously on 31 January and reached a peak on 1 February. It then steadily fluctuated from 2 February to 5, started to climb on 6 February, and then steadily declined after reaching the highest peak on 7 February. As can be seen from Figure 4 , the rising trend of daily Weibo numbers and that of the confirmed cases of epidemics is very similar in this early stage. They both rapidly rose around January 19. However, the overall Weibo response was quick and higher than the number of confirmed cases. Since then, the number of confirmed cases continued to rise, but due to the Chinese New Year holiday, Weibo data remained stable (or even slightly decreased) and continued to rise steadily after 29 January in line with the trend of confirmed cases.

The curve then steadily declined towards the 29th and rose slowly to 1 February. There was a small peak on February 1, then it stabilized and reached a peak again on 5 February. The topics of \"government response\" and \"making donations\" started to rise steadily from 20 January, then declined after showing a small peak around 26 January, after which it started to climb on 4 February and reached a peak on 5 February. \"Seeking help\" started to rise suddenly on 22 January showing a small peak before and after Wuhan was placed under lockdown on the 23rd, then climbing on 4 February reaching a peak on 6 February and then levelling off. Figure 11 presents the time series of all sub-topics except \"other\". From the perspective of the general trends, the three sub-topics, \"questioning the government and media\", \"staying at home and taking necessary precautions\", and \"taking scientific protective measures\" showed a similar variation tendency over time. The numbers of texts on those three sub-topics improved quickly on 20 January and peaked on the 21st, then gradually decreased but fluctuated towards 29 January, rose obviously on 31 January, and reached a peak on 1 February. Since then, the curve has been steadily fluctuating, beginning to rise on 5 February. \"Fear and worry\", \"objective comment\", and \"blessing and praying\" climbed from 20 January, reached their peak on 21, fell steadily, then rose again on 5 February and Figure 11 presents the time series of all sub-topics except \"other\".

Since 20 January, they have shown an upward trend during the shock. \"Making donations\" and \"seeking help\" are relatively lagging behind. In the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, a sudden increase in the confirmed cases caused a shortage of hospital beds. Due to this, patients with suspected cases of COVID-19 had to be in isolation at home. This demonstrated that the planning and allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. Then, with the establishment of the Huoshenshan and Leishenshan Hospitals (Wuhan) in early February, this situation was relieved but not resolved thoroughly. On 23 January Wuhan was on lockdown, the \"making donations\" began to rise steadily and rose significantly after 4 February. \"Seeking help\" started to significantly climb after 4 February and on 5 February, the curve reached its peak when an additional online help channel was opened. The above characteristics indicate that public expressing opinions in emergencies is not random but has periods of silence and noise that are highly volatile and vulnerable to external influences. These results are consistent with previous studies of public responses in emergency situations. The public sentiment in Twitter was highly correlated with external factors, such as the impact from official mass media, important social events, extreme weather, and public holidays [29, 30] .",

Wuhan, Hubei Province, as the heart of the outbreak of COVID-19, is undoubtedly a hot spot of public concern. Most of the other regions mentioned above are densely populated areas and areas of economic development. In 2018, the proportion of the resident population in urban agglomerations such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing reached 30.8%, and the GDP of these areas accounted for 53.7% of the country. High levels of economic development and population density do not only mean that these regions have a convenient transportation infrastructure network, as these factors may increase the possibility of the epidemic spreading among people more rapidly, which makes epidemic prevention and control more difficult. Improving emergency management and social governance in urban areas during outbreak responses is an issue that should be emphasized.",

For example, the discussions of dengue fever in cyberspace have a strong degree of spatial correlation with real-world epidemic dengue activity [11] .

When the search radius is less than 200 km, the hotspots of Weibo texts are mainly at the city level. When the search radius is 300 and 400 km, there is a significant provincial transboundary area spatial agglomeration of Weibo texts. Thus, enhancing the emergency response at boundary zones among different provinces is the key governance point at the province level. The result with a search radius of 500 km shows a regional spatial hotspot. At the national level, the government should strengthen the response in key urban agglomerations. Considering the differences in the risk levels of COVID-19 among different spatial scales, establishing a hierarchical emergency response mechanism of \"region-province-city\" is expected to be of substantial significance.",

The \"events notification\" and \"popularization of prevention and treatment\", respectively, show high-value areas with Beijing as the core. As the capital and political center of China, Beijing is also the headquarters of many public media. A report on the epidemic can play a role in stabilizing public sentiment. Therefore, it is crucial for the government to take initiatives to make information transparent and to make an appeal for scientific prevention. The distribution of \"government response\" and \"personal response\" is similar, but the intensity and scope of the former is higher than that of the latter. In China, local governments responded very strongly and quickly to COVID-19 by following the instructions of the central government. \"Seeking help\" is concentrated around Wuhan, and \"making donations\" is more plentiful than \"seeking help\" in quantity and is distributed globally, reflecting the emergency relief tradition of China: \"when trouble occurs at one spot, help comes from all quarters\". \"Seeking medical help\", \"seeking relief materials\", \"appealing for aiding patients\", and \"popularizing anti-epidemic knowledge in family\" are mainly concentrated around Wuhan, which is related to the severe epidemic situation and the lack of materials in Wuhan. The spatial distribution of 'willing to return work' shows that there is a strong willingness to return to work in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Chengdu, which have more job opportunities or labor resources.",

This shows that social media is an important channel through which the public carried out risk perception and shared opinions and emotions during the outbreak of COVID-19. The proportion of \"events notification\", \"popularization of prevention and treatment\", and \"government response\" are more than 60%, suggesting that the public are mainly focused on fighting the epidemic, and the timely authoritative information released by the Chinese government is targeted and effective. Since 23 January over 30 provinces successively launched first-level responses to major public health emergencies within three days. As of 30 January, all provinces, including provinces with a few confirmed cases that were substantially distant from Wuhan, had activated a first-level public health emergency response. In the meantime, China strengthened logistics and online platforms to facilitate the online ordering and shopping of goods via contactless delivery. Many cities also issued notices regarding \"closed management\" to communities in their region, calling for avoiding unnecessary transportation and for working from home. These findings show that the government's timely release of targeted and effective authoritative information helped eliminate panic and promote the stability of public sentiment. Meanwhile, less than 10% of \"seeking help\" and \"making donations\" indicate that more attention should be paid to information directly related to disaster relief: \"seeking help\" and \"making donations\" are extremely important, although in small quantities. Paying more attention to vulnerable minority groups should also be considered a crucial aspect of social governance.",

In response to the government's requirements, most people stayed at home and actively took protective measures. Many people paid tribute to medical staff and prayed for the epidemic to pass. Some objective opinions about COVID-19 were also expressed by Weibo users, for example, \"objective comment\", \"appealing for aiding patients\", and \"willing to return work\". However, 19.17% of Weibo texts concerned \"fear and worry\", \"questioning the government and media\", and \"condemning bad habits\", showing negative emotions during the epidemic. People expressed their fears about COVID-19, condemned the consumption of wild animals, and expressed anger at the spread of rumors. When \"whistle-blower\" doctor Li Wenliang passed away, most people expressed their respect and condolences to him, but some expressed their dissatisfaction, considering that the government's response was too slow or that media reports were untrue. It can be inferred that the timely release and updating of epidemic-related information is an effective measure to avoid public panic and stop the spread of misinformation.",

The results of the evaluation show that the approach for topic extraction is accurate and viable for understanding public opinions. We obtained seven topics and 13 sub-topics related to COVID-19 from Weibo texts and analyzed their temporal-spatial distributions. (1) The topics with a proportion of more than 60% were \"events notification\", \"popularization of prevention and treatment\", and \"government response\". In the subtopics, \"staying at home and taking necessary precautions\", \"blessing and praying\", \"taking scientific protective measures\", and \"popularizing anti-epidemic knowledge in family\" was the most-expressed sub-topic. This finding indicates that timely release of information from the government was helpful in stabilizing public opinion in the early stage of COVID-19. (2) The temporal changes in Weibo texts are synchronous with the development of the COVID-19 outbreak. Public opinions during epidemic outbreaks are volatile and vulnerable to external influences. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts shows a distribution pattern that Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration were significant high-value areas besides Wuhan. This means that the temporal-spatial distribution of opinions was related to the severity of the epidemic, the degree of population aggregation, and the level of economic development. (3) The spatial distribution of public opinions is regionally different and has a scale feature, exhibiting aggregation characteristics in cities, provincial border areas, and key urban agglomeration regions. Though in small quantities, the \"seeking help\" and \"making donations\" topics can directly provide support for emergency response and post-disaster management. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the public opinion response and epidemic prevention and control in the key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level; in addition, it should formulate accurate response countermeasures following the public's demands in controlling the crisis. This study contributes to existing research on uncovering knowledge regarding emergencies from social media by presenting a reliable approach to mining people's detailed opinions about COVID-19. The findings of this research could provide a rapid situational assessment, help decision makers to better understand public opinions toward COVID-19, and support analysts in planning and executing appropriate resource allocation.",

Second, the paper only analyzed texts from social media, while other content, such as pictures and videos in blogs, may also be informative. Third, there are manipulated opinions on social media (e.g., \"fake news\" and \"troll opinions\"). Thus, the better quantification of the noise caused by manipulated opinions needs further investigation. In addition, reducing the noise caused by manipulated opinions in social media data needs to be explored further. With COVID-19, which has been characterized as a pandemic by WHO [31] , we will continually acquire new data from Weibo, train and improve the model, analyze the changes and driving mechanisms of public opinion, and provide active references for governmental responses.",
