In recent years, an increase in their consumption has been observed as fresh fruits have increased in popularity as part of the human diet. As a consequence, an increase in the number of outbreaks related to fresh fruit consumption has been observed. Soft fruits have been frequently linked to outbreaks, especially to emerging pathogens that have been recently identified in this type of fruit. Identification of the causative agents in an outbreak has been facilitated by recent developments in foodborne pathogen detection. New methodologies for identification of pathogens have helped not only to identify emerging pathogens, but also to support improvement of surveillance and agricultural practice systems.",

This might be attributable to the popularity that berries have gained because of their content of compounds associated with health benefits.

Production of soft fruit in different countries has also expanded their availability in all seasons in most regions (Parish et al., 2012). With the myriad of production and safety systems performed worldwide, it is not surprising that hygienic practices during soft fruit production are quite diverse. The safety of food, and in this case of soft fruit, involves potential contamination from chemical, physical and microbiological sources (Fig. 21.2\n). Potential microbiological risks are the main safety issue with fresh fruit. Fresh produce is most often contaminated as a result of poor practice in primary production and/or misuse of natural and environmental resources (Brassard et al., 2012, Newell et al., 2010), for example the irrigation of produce with polluted water (including possible contamination through roots owing to drop irrigation (Urbanucci et al., 2009)), contact with human faeces or faecal soiled materials and poor hygiene practice by food handlers during harvest (Le\u00f3n-F\u00e9lix et al., 2010). Furthermore, contamination may arise by inappropriate practices during processing or at the point of sale/consumption (Boxman et al., 2011, Daniels et al., 2000, Schmid et al., 2007). Finally, there may be cross-contamination from polluted wash water, working instruments or surfaces, which had been previously contaminated by infected food handlers or contaminated food items (D\u2019Souza et al., 2006, Boxman et al., 2009, Dreyfuss, 2009).",

Physical contamination may not represent a high risk in soft fruit unless the fruits are processed for juices, jam or frozen. Physical contamination of processed soft fruit occurs when any material such as metal fragments, gravel, jewellery and glass particles, which is not normally in processed products, can produce illness or injury to consumers (Daeschel and Pathima, 2007). Chemical contamination might occur during production or processing of soft fruit (Fig. 21.2). Use of pesticides in berry production can be carried to either fresh or processed fruit, representing a high risk to consumers. It is therefore crucial to follow integral agricultural practices in the field to ensure that chemical residues are not passed through the soft fruit processing to reach consumers (Parish et al., 2012). Chemical contaminants can also be introduced during processing when compounds recognized as safe are not used in agreement with regulatory guidelines. Compounds recognized as safe might include antioxidants, preservatives, sulfiting agents and colorants, among others (Daeschel and Pathima, 2007).",

Contrary to infections where Salmonella and Vibrio were the causative agents, the reduction of illnesses caused by these five pathogens is attributed to improved detection and surveillance systems, regulatory banning of contaminated ground beef with E. coli O157 and increased awareness of the risk of consumption of undercooked beef in food service organizations and at home. However, pathogens that are not included in these surveillance systems such as norovirus (NoV), Clostridium perfringens and Toxoplasma are still the main microorganisms causing human illness. As a result of developments in methods for viral testing in soft fruits and recent strategies to improve the production, quality and safety of soft fruit production, recent data on the presence of bacteria and parasites in soft fruit are scarce. Some reports of outbreaks linked to bacterial and parasitic pathogen presence in soft fruit were reported more than 10 years ago (Table 21.1\n). From 1973 to 1997, nine outbreaks were linked to berries including strawberry (four), raspberry (four) and blackberry (one). Seven of those outbreaks were associated with Cyclospora and one with Staphylococcus aureus (Sivapalasingam et al., 2004).",

Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella have been isolated from frozen blueberries and fresh strawberries respectively (Zhao, 2005). In addition, the attachment of bacteria or parasites to soft fruit surfaces is also another factor that could lead to an increment of the microbial load. Kniel et al. (2002) demonstrated that oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii can attach to berry epidermis and persist during 8 weeks. T. gongii is a coccidial parasite related to Cyclospora and it can be used as a Cyclospora surrogate. Raw soft fruit is usually harvested by hand and packed in containers that will eventually reach consumers without being washed. For example, strawberries that will be frozen, are destemmed in the fields, most of the time using thumbnail or metal devices. The extra human handling of the soft fruit therefore represents an opportunity for a pathogen to attach to the food surface and survive. Although no recent data are available about outbreaks linked to contaminated soft fruit with bacterial or parasitic pathogens, the hygienic practices used for their production could eventually lead to high bacterial or parasitic loads.",

As examples, frozen raspberries have caused NoV outbreaks in Finland, Denmark, Sweden and France (Little and Gillespie, 2008), and, in 2012, Germany experienced their biggest foodborne NoV outbreak ever caused by frozen strawberries implicated in outbreaks that involved 500 institutions with 11 000 cases (Anonymous, 2012). Even though several viruses such as enterovirus, human rotavirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, coronaviruses or aichi virus appear capable of causing foodborne illness or emerging as foodborne pathogens, all recent data show that hepatitis A virus (HAV) and NoV continue to be the most common viral pathogens causing foodborne illness (Yadav et al., 2010). Statistical data have shown that HAV is a higher health risk than other pathogens such as Salmonella Typhi, Shigella sonnei or Staphylococcus aureus because of the number of deaths caused by HAV outbreaks (Todd et al., 2009). Besides the risk that soft fruits can be contaminated with viruses during growth, the role that food workers play in the spread of illness has been assessed in HAV and NoV outbreaks in which over 50% of the cases were hospitalized. Bidawid et al. determined that 9% of HAV and nearly 18% of a NoV surrogate, feline calicivirus (FCV), could be transferred from artificially contaminated finger pads to lettuce by contacts during food handling. When studying the opposite route of transmission, they found that 14% of FCV could be transferred from lettuce to bare hands (Bidawid et al., 2004, Bidawid et al., 2000a). This ease of reversible viral transfer between workers and produce was later supported in a field study (Le\u00f3n-F\u00e9lix et al., 2010) evaluating the impact of harvesting and packinghouse operations on the contamination of green bell pepper with NoV. When testing the workers\u2019 hands for NoV before and after 3 hours of work, they were able to show a change in the rates of positivity of 0% to 14% for pickers, 53% to 33% for classifiers and 45% to 25% for packers. Although these data are for fresh produce, similar viral transmission is expected to occur during soft fruit production because of the similar practices of picking.",

            "text": "The recent year\u2019s significant progress in the method development for virus detection in foods reflects the growing acknowledgement of the risk of food acting as a vector for virus transmission. With the introduction of TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), it has been possible to simultaneously confirm the amplified product (Mattison et al., 2009b, Lees and CEN/WG6/TAG4, 2010) as well as to estimate the amount of detectable virus genomes (Le Guyader et al., 2009). However, the lack of reliable and harmonized sampling plans and standardization in the detection methods limits their suitability for routine analysis of viruses in soft fruit. Therefore, data on the prevalence and titres of viruses in these matrices are rare. In a collection of data on outbreaks that occurred in USA during 1990\u20132005 with known aetiology, fresh produce accounted for 13% (713/5416) of all foodborne related outbreaks (Dewaal and Bhuiya, 2007, Doyle and Erickson, 2008). Of these, NoV was the most common pathogen accounting for 40% of outbreaks associated with fresh produce (i.e. fruits and vegetables). Specifically, NoV in lettuce and salad greens alone accounted for nearly 25% of the produce-associated outbreaks (Doyle and Erickson, 2008). Data from the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), outbreak investigations, and a few monitoring studies verify this importance of fresh produce as a high-risk food product for NoV. The application of recently developed methods in outbreak investigations has begun to provide an insight into the magnitude of contamination of soft fruits that has resulted in disease after consumption. Several outbreak reports of NoV-contaminated raspberries describe large numbers (up to 11 000) of people being infected (Falkenhorst et al., 2005, Sarvikivi et al., 2011a, Anonymous, 2012). Table 21.2\nillustrates published outbreaks where NoV contaminated soft fruits were epidemiologically linked to the patients and available for viral testing. Only a few screening studies have been conducted of viruses in soft fruits. In a French study of soft red fruits, 6.7% of 150 samples tested positive for NoV genogroup I (GI), GII or both (Baert et al., 2011). In a Canadian study of irrigated, field-grown strawberries, 26% (16/60) of samples were positive for NoV GI, and a few samples also tested positive for swine hepatitis E virus genogroup 3 and human rotavirus (Brassard et al., 2012). In a minor screening study in Belgium, five samples from each of two lots of raspberries and 10 samples from each of two lots of strawberries were tested for NoV. Infrequently, samples from all four lots were found to be positive for NoV GI, GII or both (Stals et al., 2011). The quantified levels of NoV found in these studies are summarized in Table 21.3\n. No illnesses could be connected to these batches of soft fruit, despite some being contaminated with NoV in levels similar to or exceeding the estimated infectivity dose of 18\u20131000 viral particles (Teunis, 2008) and what is commonly found for oysters associated with disease outbreaks (102\u2013104 NoV genomic copies/g digestive tissue) (Dore et al., 2010, Le Guyader et al., 2008). According to the authors, suggested reasons for this could be under-reporting of sporadic gastroenteritis and that the amount of NoV genomic copies detected by RT-qPCR (which does not differentiate between infective and non-infective viruses) may overestimate the amount of infectious viruses (Baert et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Finally, although rather similar analytical principles are used among the laboratories when analyzing soft red fruits, there are important factors which differ such as variation in the number of samples (29 to 150) and most likely also batches tested, which may affect the prevalence of positive findings. Moreover, the difference in the initial and analyzed sample sizes (10\u201325 g or 0.025\u20131.25 respectively) is likely to affect the detection limit of the target virus as well as the risk of co-extracted RT-PCR inhibitors. Thus, interpretation of the NoV prevalence and quantitative findings in relation to general occurrence and comparison of results between laboratories should be handled with care. To assist source attribution studies, a recent EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) report (EFSA BIOHAZ, 2011) recommended systematic strain typing in combination with routine harmonized surveillance of viral outbreaks, and of virus occurrence in food commodities. Successful typing of the NoV findings was achieved in only a few of the outbreak studies listed in Table 21.2 (Maunula et al., 2009, Ponka et al., 1999, Le Guyader et al., 2004). The failure to obtain NoV sequences from these samples could be because the strains initially detected by RT-qPCR were not recognized by the applied primers used for conventional RT-PCR or below the assay detection limit (Baert et al., 2011). Other common issues that can challenge successful sequencing of virus strains detected in soft fruits could be insufficiently pure RNA extract or simultaneous RT-PCR amplification of multiple strains (Sarvikivi et al., 2011a).",

            "text": "As for other types of foods, an appropriate sampling strategy is important to undertake effective pathogen monitoring. This is particularly important for methods applied within a legislative context and used for risk management and control (Bosch et al., 2011). A plan for sampling should be established on a risk-based approach and the sample or subsamples must represent the original matrix. In addition, the sampling process must not alter the condition of the sample and thus not affect the subsequent analysis (Bosch et al., 2011). To develop a sampling plan for pathogen analyses, it is important to consider the characteristics of the matrix to be analyzed (nature, food category, composition and amount) as the choice of sample size may rely on the capability of the available method to remove inhibitors along the sample processing (Rodriguez-Lazaro et al., 2011). Currently, there is no official standard for sampling for virus detection in foods (Rodriguez-Lazaro et al., 2011) and the limited amount of available harmonized data makes it difficult to enable effective application of virological methods for monitoring virus contamination in food. The low viral infectious dose requires sampling and testing of relatively large volumes of food. In general, published protocols for viral analyses of soft fruits use an initial sample size of 10\u2013100 g (Table 21.4\n). Although viruses have been recovered from relatively small amounts of soft fruit (Stals et al., 2011), the concentration of virus particles often varies within a consignment, between sub-batches, and even between single pieces of food because of uneven distribution of contamination (Falkenhorst et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Conventional methods for bacteria in food are generally used for the analysis of pathogens in soft fruit. Standard methods in different countries are based on the methods recommended by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO). Methods for bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter or E. coli have been published basing the detection on enrichment of cells in selective media. Some of the new methods for detection of bacteria in soft fruit base the pathogen identification on combining culture methods followed by a molecular identification of the target. Although the advantage of this strategy is the speed in assessment of microbial safety, the downside is the identification of the total microbial load. This is because selective media and culture conditions are used for a specific target, making undetectable other infectious pathogens that could be present in low numbers in the soft fruit analyzed. The identification of parasites is based on indirect quantification of the number of oocysts present in a food matrix. Immunoassays are most commonly used for the separation of oocysts; however, the bottleneck in the identification of pathogens is still the sample preparation (Ortega and Sterling, 2006). A recent study compared the use of different wash solutions for identification of C. cayetanensis in raspberries (Shields, 2012). A high recovery of oocysts was obtained (80.2 \u00b1 11.3%) using 0.1% of a solution containing a synthetic detergent and surfactant and a food additive with emulsifying and dispersing properties, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (C12H25C6H4SO3Na) and tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7) respectively. The recovery using this solution represented about twofold of the recovery obtained from raspberries using 1 M glycine pH 5.5 in a standard method reported by Cook et al. (2006a). Although the recovery was improved, the detection method for oocysts was microscopy in both cases, which is the conventional detection method for oocysts in water (Ortega and Sterling, 2006, Cook et al., 2006a, Cook et al., 2006b).",

            "text": "Evaluation of the safety of soft fruits has recently focused on detection of viruses as a result of the frequent soft-fruit-borne outbreaks of NoV and HAV (Table 21.2). As viruses do not replicate in food and the most important foodborne viruses (such as NoV) cannot be propagated in vitro, conventional identification for clinical samples based on microscopy or immunoassays, which requires a large amount of viral particles, cannot be used. Therefore, the development of molecular methods for identification of viruses in different food matrices has greatly helped in identification of pathogens that were not conventionally identified some years ago. However, compared with bacterial pathogens that can be cultured, the demands of high assay sensitivity and the lack of ability to differentiate between PCR-detected infectious and non-infectious particles are still major drawbacks in the detection methods for viruses in foods. New developments in the safety testing of soft fruit therefore aim to improve the sample preparation methods to overcome the low number challenge. Whichever method is used, it is crucial to ensure that issues associated with low virus numbers and the complexity of the matrix do not result in false negative or false positive interpretations of results. Therefore, effective quality controls must be included as part of the detection method. Such controls were included to a varying degree in the methods used for the screening and outbreak studies listed in Tables 21.2 and 21.3 and are also described by D\u2019Agostino et al. (2011). After the initial sampling, most methods for the detection of viruses in soft-fruits include the following three steps: elution and concentration of virus from the food matrix; extraction of nucleic acid; and detection, confirmation and quantification of target viral RNA. The most critical part of sample processing before detection of viral RNA is the elution and concentration of virus particles from the food matrix. Each step must be designed to achieve reduction of sample volume while simultaneously recovering the viruses and eliminating matrix-associated inhibitors. Various strategies for each step have been described, and an overview of selected methods used for soft fruit is summarized in Table 21.4.",

For detection of NoV and HAV RNA, a large variety of published RT-qPCR assays are available in the scientific literature. For NoV, some of these can be found in the references in Tables 21.2\u20134, and for HAV, assays developed by, for example, Costafreda et al. (2006) and Jothikumar et al. (2005) have been successfully used for analysis of foods. Examples of the use of quality controls can also be found in some of these studies (Baert et al., 2011, Costafreda et al., 2006). To quantify NoV detected by RT-qPCR, the value of a positive signal must be converted into RNA copies by interpolation to a standard curve. Based on the primers and probe used in the detection assay, a standard curve can be generated from different types of nucleic acids: purified synthetic RNA or DNA oligonucleotides spanning the complete PCR amplicon, plasmid DNA constructs or in vitro transcribed RNA (Costafreda et al., 2006, Le Guyader et al., 2009). Because of lack of validation and harmonization of the type and use of standard curves, exact comparison between viral loads detected in different studies may not be possible.",

Implementation of improved hygienic measures is therefore needed in agricultural operations to avoid risk of viral contamination (Rodriguez-Lazaro et al., 2011). Farm and restaurant owners are responsible for the safety of the food they harvest or prepare, and for providing sufficient training to their employees who handle foods (Hicks et al., 1996). Decontamination processes are also important, as they affect pathogen viability, survival, persistence and cross-contamination between food items (Hirneisen et al., 2010). However, for fragile foods, for example raspberries, which lose their visual and sensory qualities when exposed to washing, heating or high pressure processing, there may not be many options for decontamination. To implement control measures such as detection of viruses in the food production, the EU requires the inclusion of a standardized and quality controlled reference method. To meet this requirement, a protocol for viral RNA extraction and detection has been developed within the CEN/TC275/WG6/TAG4 (virus detection in foods). Still, it is essential to gain more information about the practical application (e.g. sampling plans and result interpretation) of these methods for the assessment of product safety (Lees and CEN/WG6/TAG4, 2010). Current molecular assays to detect viruses can supplement prevention efforts as part of the HACCP program of producers of soft fruit (Baert et al., 2011, Brassard et al., 2012) and provide knowledge of the extent of viral distribution (Mattison et al., 2010). However, the available molecular detection methods must be accommodated by harmonized sampling plans and procedures to interpret results before they can be used for routine monitoring and control (Rodriguez-Lazaro et al., 2011).",

In this sense, soft fruits thought to be a conventionally \u2018safe\u2019 food, have turned out to be one of the main channels for introduction of viral pathogens to the food supply. Therefore, new developments on testing of soft fruit are focused towards sample preparation methods\u2014fast, easy to use and able to remove inhibitors to molecular identification. The viral load in soft fruits, as with other complex matrices, still represents a challenge because of inhibitors that may be introduced downstream to molecular identification. It is therefore evident that until the sample preparation bottleneck is passed, availability of molecular methods such as real-time PCR, microarrays, immunoassays or next generation sequencing to identify/quantify a pathogen is still restrained. Furthermore, the lack of differentiation between infectious and non-infectious viral particles, and possible bacterial and parasitic pathogens, remains a major issue in standardization of soft fruit testing. As future remarks, the detection step in pathogen identification should evolve towards identification of bacterial, viral and parasitic targets in one step. In addition, a continuous record of the presence of each pathogen in soft fruit as well as development of in-field applications for identification should be expanded to satisfy the demands of the dynamic food chain.",
