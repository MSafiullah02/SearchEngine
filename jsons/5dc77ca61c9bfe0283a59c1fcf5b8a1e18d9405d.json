Our research shows that there is a significant association between contingency measures and improvement in air quality, clean beaches and environmental noise reduction. On the other hand, there are also negative secondary aspects such as the reduction in recycling and the increase in waste, further endangering the contamination of physical spaces (water and land), in addition to air. Global economic activity is expected to return in the coming months in most countries (even if slowly), so decreasing GHG concentrations during a short period is not a sustainable way to clean up our environment.",

This as a result of the reduction in waste generated by tourists who visit the beaches. Likewise, noise levels have fallen significantly in most countries. The decrease in the use of private and public transportation, as well as commercial activities, have caused a reduction in noise. Despite the positive indirect effects on the environment, the new coronavirus has also generated negative indirect ones. For example, in the USA, some cities have suspended recycling programs because authorities have been concerned about the risk of spreading the virus in recycling centers. On the other hand, in the European nations particularly affected, sustainable waste management has been restricted. For example, Italy has prohibited infected residents from sorting their waste. On the other hand, some industries have seized the opportunity to repeal disposable bag bans. Companies that once encouraged consumers to bring their bags have increasingly switched to single-use packaging. For example, a popular coffee company announced a temporary ban on the use of reusable cups. Finally, online food ordering has increased. These growths are resulting in the increase of domestic waste, both organic and inorganic. This research aims to show the positive and negative indirect effects of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus on the environment. After analyzing each indirect effect, objective conclusions on the subject are presented. 2. Positive and negative indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment 2.1 Decreased concentrations of NO 2 and PM 2.5 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Air quality is essential for people's health; however, 91% of the world population lives in places where poor air quality exceeds the permissible limits (WHO, 2016). The consequences of air quality degradation are manifested in a significant percentage of global mortality each year (Zhang et al., 2017). In this regard, the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report indicates that air pollution contributes to almost 8% of total deaths in the world; the most affected countries being those found in Africa, Asia and part of Europe (WHO, 2016). China implemented strict traffic restrictions and self-quarantine measures to control the expansion of SARS-CoV2. These actions generated changes in air pollution. Due to quarantine, NO 2 was reduced by 22.8 \u03bcg / m3 and 12.9 \u03bcg / m3 in Wuhan and China, respectively. PM 2.5 fell by 1.4 \u03bcg / m3 in Wuhan but decreased by 18.other hand, the readings from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite show a significant decrease in NO 2 concentrations over Rome, Madrid, and Paris, the first cities in Europe to implement strict quarantine measures.

However, non-responsible use by people has caused many beaches in the world to present pollution problems (Partelow et al., 2015). The lack of tourists, as a result of the social distancing measures due to the new coronavirus pandemic, has caused a notable change in the appearance of many beaches in the world.

Consequently, organic waste generated by households has increased. Also, food purchased online is shipped packed, so inorganic waste has also increased.Medical waste is also on the rise. Hospitals in Wuhan produced an average of 240 metric tons of medical waste per day during the outbreak, compared to their previous average of fewer than 50 tons. In other countries such as the USA, there has been an increase in garbage from personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves (Calma, 2020). in waste recycling Waste recycling has always been a major environmental problem of interest to all countries (Liu et al., 2020). Recycling is a common and effective way to prevent pollution, save energy, and conserve natural resources (Varotto and Spagnolli, 2017; Ma et al., 2019). As a result of the pandemic, countries such as the USA have stopped recycling programs in some of their cities, as authorities have been concerned about the risk of COVID-19 spreading in recycling centers. In particularly affected European countries, waste management has been restricted. For example, Italy has prohibited infected residents from sorting their waste.",

However, there is no evidence on the survival of the SARS-CoV2 virus in drinking water or wastewater (WHO, 2020b). On the contrary, the excess of chlorine in the water could generate harmful effects on people'aims to expose the first indirect effects that the new coronavirus has had on the environment. The positive and negative indirect effects are highlighted. The positive indirect effects revolve around the reduction of PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations in China, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Precisely the high concentrations of these gases are one of the greatest environmental problems of developed countries (Sharma and Dhar, 2018). Also, the quality improvement of the beaches and the reduction of environmental noise were highlighted as positive indirect effects. On the other hand, among the negative indirect effects, the increase in domestic and medical waste were mentioned. The restriction to recycle waste in countries like the USA and Italy has been another negative indirect effect of SARS-CoV2. It is essential to mention that although the emissions of some GHGs have decreased as a result of the pandemic, this reduction could have little impact on the total concentrations of GHGs that have accumulated in the atmosphere for decades. For a significant decline, there should be a long-term structural change in the countries' economies. This result can be achieved through the ratification of the environmental commitments made.",
