Developed countries periodically upgrade their public health systems\u2014eg, the EU formed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\u2014and over time, citizens' expectations have risen such that providing poor public goods in health is politically unacceptable. Low-income countries need to prioritise services that produce public goods to more effectively improve health outcomes for their people, especially in view of their limited resources and high burdens of communicable disease. International health security cannot be ensured without strong national population-wide health services to reduce the spread of diseases across borders.",

A strong population-wide system is crucial both to respond to disease outbreaks and to address potential health threats before an outbreak can occur. A striking manifestation of this neglect is a scarcity of coherent public health regulations in many countries with which donors have been working for decades.4 Fortunately, there is renewed international awareness of population-wide health services,5 with the increasing evidence of re-emerging diseases for which present treatments are inadequate. However, donors and international aid agencies must first clarify the constituents of an effective public health system and the process for helping countries to build them.",

Heavy expenditure on sanitary infrastructure, such as sewerage, is not necessary since most of the population uses stand-alone latrines.

The Alma-Ata declaration of 1978 emphasised that a comprehensive approach to primary health care should include safe water and sanitation, and prevention and control of endemic diseases. In 2000, however, WHO pointed out that the goals remained largely unmet because of various shortfalls, such as absence of clarity about targets and how to meet them, compounded by shortages of funding and training.14\n",

Environmental management of vector-borne diseases has also been addressed in the developed world through multisectoral coordination, initially to eradicate these diseases and now to ensure that they do not re-emerge. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which eradicated malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases from a large tract of the USA in the 1930s, continues to collaborate with the health department to monitor mosquito breeding.16 These crucial services can be provided in developing countries by strengthening population-wide health systems.",

But the code has also gone much further by establishing a legal framework to lay the basis for technical collaboration between the Pan American Sanitary Bureau and its member countries to reduce disease burdens within each country. This collaboration seeks to systematically strengthen all aspects of health systems, including population-wide services. For example, PAHO's programme with Belize includes training of environmental health officers and strengthening of water quality monitoring, solid waste management, vector control, and food safety.21, 22 Methods to identify targets for improvement in public health systems, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have also been used by most of PAHO's member countries.23\n",

International aid agencies have also begun to focus on health systems\u2014eg, WHO's revised International Health Regulations address public health emergencies of international concern and health system capacities. Unfortunately, WHO mainly focuses on the capacity of health systems to detect and respond to disease outbreaks of international concern, which is inherently inefficient. If health systems are poorly prepared to implement health regulations and other measures to reduce exposure to disease, there will be repeated outbreaks to control.",

First, information about the basic institutional and regulatory underpinnings of population-wide services should be compiled to help countries and donors improve these services. Analysis of the approaches used in countries such as Sri Lanka can show the strengths and weaknesses of different system designs. Second, international collaboration needs to be channelled towards building and maintenance of national health systems, with a focus on long-term collaboration to build public goods in health.19 This effort should draw lessons from PAHO's successful collaboration with its member countries despite their political and economic exigencies. Third, global health cooperation needs a good framework for action, such as Gostin24 has proposed. This framework would help coordinate the fragmented activities of international organisations, countries, non-governmental organisations, and civil society, and create incentives for more effective international health assistance.",
