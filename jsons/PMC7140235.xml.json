This deadly condition was first discovered among young homosexual men in the United States, and it soon became clear that it was spread through sexual intercourse. While the disease was first perceived to be confined to local outbreaks in the United States, Europe and Haiti, by 1985 the global scope of AIDS was hardly disputed (Knight 2008: 13). Many African countries were severely struck by the disease, and the potential expansion of the virus alarmed both specialists and the wider public (Soni 1998: 21\u201325).",

WHO, an experienced health development agency, was to facilitate scientific exchange and find the means to combat the spread of HIV (Soni 1998: 26). SPA/GPA, which was placed directly under the authority of the director-general, was supplied with large extrabudgetary donations by wealthy member states. Between 1987 and 1990, contributions rose from an annual US$30 million to $90 million (Knight 2008: 16), and GPA grew into the largest single programme in WHO (Merson et al. 2008: 480\u20131), employing 400 individuals by 1990 (Soni 1998: 34). Its comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS \u2014 ranging from sex education and condom promotion to efforts to improve blood safety \u2014 became \u2018axiomatic\u2019 (Leaning 1998: 754) in the health community. Furthermore, through its cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), GPA was able to provide both technical and financial support to developing countries (Chin 2007: 200\u20132).",

GPA collaborated with other UN organisations such as UNICEF, the UN Population Fund and the International Labour Organization (ILO), and with non-governmental organisations and human rights groups. The trust that donors2 had in the programme was expressed not only in rising contributions, but also by the fact that their contributions were unspecified, leaving decisions about their specific usage to GPA leaders (Mann and Kay 1991: S223; Soni 1998: 61).",

GPA's role was reinterpreted as a technical rather than multisectoral programme. Its activities were concentrated on treatment and medical research, while the social and behavioural components of the pandemic as well as GPA's previous human rights agenda became marginalised. Furthermore, GPA's coordinating function was interpreted much more restrictively. Collaboration with civil society organisations was scaled down to financial transfers, while outreach to communal partners ceased to be a priority. Personnel experienced in the field of HIV/AIDS were moved out of the programme and replaced by staff with internal bureaucratic credentials (Soni 1998: 90\u201397). Hence, GPA's autonomy was significantly curbed and its programme reoriented towards its medical core.",

It consequently provoked not only a crisis of confidence, but also a decline in donations to GPA beginning in 1991 (Knight 2008: 18). Thus, 1990 was a major turning point for WHO's role in HIV/AIDS politics.3 The organisation interrupted the expansion of its flagship programme and reinterpreted its role from a global policy leader to a technical, medical agency. When UNAIDS was created in 1995, WHO belatedly attempted to reclaim UN-wide leadership (Knight 2008: 28). However, it only became one of six co-sponsoring agencies which had a seat, but no vote, at UNAIDS\u2019 Programme Coordinating Board.4 GPA was dismantled and its staff partially transferred to UNAIDS, so that in the late 1990s the number of full-time HIV/AIDS professionals at WHO went down to three (Gerbase et al. 2009: 8). Following this transfer, it took the organisation nearly a decade to rebuild capacity in this priority field of international health work.5",

Both rationalists and constructivists assume that IOs have a tendency for \u2018mission creep\u2019 rather than self-restraint. First, the rationalist PA approach suggests that self-serving IO \u2018agents\u2019 continuously strive to expand their budget and mandate, exploiting their principals\u2019 uncertainty as to whether budget increases are necessary and efficient or not (Niskanen 1994). This form of agency slack is, from a PA perspective, one of the greatest risks states face when delegating authority to IOs (Copelovitch 2010: 54, 57) and part of the explanation why IOs \u2018never die\u2019 (Strange 1998). To contain the expansionary tendencies of their agents, states can deploy budgetary constraints or circumscribe the IO's mandates (Nielson and Tierney 2003: 242; Hawkins et al. 2006: 30). However, such limitations were not present in the GPA case when the programme started to contract in 1990. Donors and member state principals did not change GPA's mandate (Soni 1998: 93), resource supply was abundant, and AIDS continued to spread while knowledge about the disease continued to grow (Mann et al. 1992). Thus, the conditions highlighted by the PA approach can hardly account for GPA's sudden change of course.",

Understood as rule-driven and self-referential Weberian bureaucracies (Barnett and Finnemore 2004), IOs are eager to apply their established competencies and approach their environment in terms of the solutions they are capable of providing (March and Olsen 1998: 966\u20138). This capacity-driven behaviour is backed up by supranational bureaucrats\u2019 cognitive inclination to see the world as demanding more rather than less bureaucratic intervention: Bureaucrats craft policies based on rational and rule-governed approaches, the natural provider of which are bureaucracies themselves (Barnett and Finnemore 2004: 43). Even organisational failures are not interpreted as reasons for withdrawal or restraint but rather for renewed and enlarged IO programmes (Barnett and Finnemore 2004: 44). Only where there is a clear mismatch between an IO's internal culture and external policy demands may an IO seek to avoid or even defy such demands in order to preserve its identity and autonomy (Barnett and Coleman 2005: 601\u20132). This was not the case for GPA though. The programme's and donors\u2019 policy goals were sufficiently aligned to prevent such a conflict, and the fact that it was funded by unspecified contributions allowed GPA to work quite autonomously.",

In fact, both approaches start from the assumption that there is some corporate interest that the organisation seeks to preserve collectively. IOs are conceived of as corporate actors with a genuine interest in self-maintenance and internally defined goals. Such a view suggests that decision making in IOs is either determined by a \u2018dominant\u2019 organisational culture (e.g., Weaver 2008: 73), or the outcome of an internal dispute where the parties ultimately settle on the position that is in the organisation's best interest (Barnett and Coleman 2005: 601). Accordingly, much of the debate about IO agency has been concerned with the question of whether external or internal determinants are more consequential for IO change, and how these determinants are balanced (Freitas 2004; Barnett and Coleman 2005).",

A self-organised bureaucracy is opposed to a collectivity of principals who jointly govern their agent once collective action problems have been overcome. Although this conceptualisation can be analytically productive and help scholars to understand, for example, how principal-induced reforms are received and mediated by resilient organisational cultures (Barnett and Coleman 2005; Nielson et al. 2006), it also comes with limitations. First, by reifying the PA divide, scholars neglect the more subtle dynamics through which agents and principals mutually influence each other. Therefore, recent contributions have highlighted the dynamic feedback processes through which bureaucrats shape principals\u2019 perceptions and preferences, rather than regarding these preferences as fixed and strictly separate (Moschella 2009; Broome 2010; Clegg 2010). Second, the dichotomy between principals and agents overstates organisational unity while obscuring contradictions and conflicts inside and outside IOs. IOs are not coherent and integrated wholes, but are made up of different units with distinct purposes. Likewise, IO environments are not coherent. The states, private actors, and civil society organisations that make up an IO's environment place complex and often contradictory demands on IOs. As Catherine Weaver (2008) has argued, incompatible external demands are often mirrored in intra-bureaucratic conflicts and induce IOs to engage in contradictory, if not \u2018hypocritical\u2019 behaviour \u2014 meaning a systematic gap between an organisation's talk and actions.",

While scientists and research institutions will demand scientific rigour and precision, media representatives will ask for clear messages, even at the cost of oversimplification.

This aspect is mostly neglected in PA approaches, which start from a \u2018strictly formal notion of power\u2019 (Nielson and Tierney 2003: 251). They thereby assume that the central channel of member states\u2019 influence on IOs is their formal authority as principals. From that perspective, the preference constellation among major principals is indeed the most important and systematic predictor for IO behaviour (Copelovitch 2010). However, it is not by coincidence that PA analyses are mostly applied to the Bretton Woods institutions, where indeed materially powerful members are also formally privileged through the system of weighted voting. Yet, in other IOs \u2014 most prominently the UN organisations that have adopted the \u2018one state, one vote\u2019 principle \u2014 organisational and external power relationships diverge. As a result, some member states (or member state subgroups) may be in a position to block organisational decisions even though the materially most powerful states would favour such decisions. Translated into IO subunits, this means that subunits allied with externally powerful member states (or private donors) may have better access to material power, while subunits allied with member states occupying critical veto points may dispose of superior formal power. The confrontation of such coalitions tends to produce unintended outcomes. A striking case where such a constellation has produced an outcome that is difficult to rationalise from a corporate perspective is GPA's \u2018mission shrink\u2019.

Recent IO scholarship has developed an interest in WHO in the face of apparent instances of \u2018slack\u2019 in the organisation such as the travel warnings that the secretariat issued during the 2003 SARS crisis (Cortell and Peterson 2006). Its potential for slack is attributed to WHO's strong identity, which is based on its professional values and medical ethos (ibid.: 266\u201371). Thus, by juxtaposing WHO to an environment of member states whose demands can also collide with organisational values, scholars have sought to reconstruct the \u2018strategic response\u2019 of an organisation that for this purpose is conceptualised as an intentional actor (Chorev 2012).",

Its status as a special programme ensured that SPA/GPA was governed from headquarters and was much less reliant on the financial and communication channels of the regional offices than conventional programmes (Godlee 1995b). Its structure was supposed to facilitate an emergency response to the HIV/AIDS crisis and bypass opposition from countries that, for ideological or political reasons, were still refusing to accept the challenge of dealing with HIV/AIDS (Knight 2008: 10, 14). However, it soon became clear that AIDS was not a passing phenomenon or temporary outbreak. Instead, it would remain an eminent and growing health concern for many years. By renaming the programme \u2018Global Programme on AIDS\u2019 in 1988, its exceptionalism was put on a regular basis (Soni 1998: 28\u201332).",

In line with demands from regional offices, he circumscribed GPA's operative autonomy and realigned it with WHO's general bureaucratic procedures, thereby reinforcing regional control. Drawing on his administrative authority, Nakajima mounted additional bureaucratic obstacles, for example, by protracting and withholding travel authorisations, which constrained Mann's leeway in directing GPA (Chin 2007: 202). Faced with these growing bureaucratic impediments, Mann resigned from WHO \u2018in protest and frustration\u2019 (Leaning 1998) and moved to the Harvard School of Public Health in 1990.

Mann's departure was followed by an immediate decline in contributions (Knight 2008: 18), and many of Mann's previous colleagues were moved to other programmes or voluntarily left GPA (Soni 1998: 95). Having lost their internal ally, external supporters of GPA started to look for alternatives in the 1990s (Slutkin 2000: S30). This coalition shift, though certainly not the only cause of UNAIDS's creation by 1996,10 strongly contributed to WHO's marginalisation in the subsequent institutional reshuffling. As other UN agencies doubted WHO's leadership role in HIV/AIDS and called for more inter-sectoral coordination, the way was paved for the creation of UNAIDS. Unsurprisingly, WHO's bid for leadership in UNAIDS went unheard. The creation of UNAIDS between 1995 and 1996 meant the end of WHO's HIV/AIDS programme, which was a \u2018significant blow to the organisation's leadership over a global health issue that should have been a clear case for it to assert its mandate\u2019 (Lee 2009: 62).",

Over his first 5 years in office, most western governments had turned their back on Nakajima and were highly critical of what they regarded as an autocratic management style and poor communication skills (Chorev 2012: 157). Nevertheless, the Japanese government insisted on having one of their own at the top of one of the UN's big specialised agencies (Godlee 1993a), and effectively lobbied for what became \u2018the narrowest victory in the history of the United Nations\u2019 (Godlee 1993b). The vote was followed by furious charges of fraud and corruption, as Nakajima's opponents accused the Japanese government of having bought developing country votes (Chorev 2012: 157; Lee 2009: 83).11 Still, Nakajima's opponents had to accept that he had been able to forge another winning coalition in WHO. They could at best shift their support to bilateral programmes or other organisations such as the World Bank and myriad public\u2013private governance arrangements that began to dominate international health work in the 1990s (Lee 2009: 99; Chorev 2012: 156\u20137). Hence, GPA's (and WHO's) decline in the 1990s were only one side of a coin, the other being Nakajima's re-election. Only after his second term in office did Nakajima decide not to run for a third term in the interests of the organisation (Lee 2009: 84).12",

Rather, the causal tendencies inherent in local coalitions depend on the kind of powers controlled by external and internal players. To specify the \u2018local orders\u2019 claim and sketch an avenue for further research, the remainder of this article suggests a broader framework for analysing local drivers of IO change that is based on insights from the WHO case.

Quite the contrary, in the face of its limited \u2018governability\u2019, WHO's donor states (and increasingly also private donors)13 now centrally rely on so-called extrabudgetary contributions to use the organisation for their purposes. As regular assessed contributions to WHO's budget have been frozen and then even shrunk in the 1980s and 1990s (Lee 2009: 39), these additional payments are now making up the main share of WHO's budget. Thus, whereas extrabudgetary donations only accounted for 20 per cent of WHO's (2010) overall budget in 1970 (Lee 2009: 39), they have risen ever since, approaching 80 per cent by 2010. Yet, unlike in the GPA case, donors now prefer to work through short-term donations that are \u2018earmarked\u2019, that is, specified for particular tasks (Kickbusch et al. 2010: 558). The result is a sustained mismatch between official priorities, agreed by the governing bodies, and WHO's (2010: 6) actual activities, as \u2018[e]ven projects authorised by World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions are reliant on a chase for funding\u2019 (People's Health Movement, Medact and Global Equity Gauge Alliance 2008: 228).",

While WHO's (2008: 12\u201313) central management has an interest in more flexible, unspecified funds that can be more freely allocated, earmarking allows those individual programmes that are successful fundraisers to negotiate their own terms with donors instead of submitting their income to centralised oversight.",

They thus may be broadly divided into donors and recipients. Internal organisational allies, by contrast, can be divided into those that occupy veto positions regarding collective decisions and those that do not. Obviously, these are rough categories that can only provide a first step towards a full explanatory typology (cf. George and Bennett 2005: 233\u201362). They are neither logically exhaustive nor do they grasp the full empirical variance to be found in intra-organisational constellations (Bendor and Hammond 1992).

Still, ordering trans-organisational politics in terms of material resources and organisational veto positions is a useful heuristic for specifying how trans-organisational dynamics can influence IO change, both positively and negatively. Such an approach also resonates with recent attempts by historical institutionalists to categorise modes of institutional change in terms of actor and rule characteristics (Mahoney and Thelen 2010, especially 18\u201322) and thus takes up the challenge of bringing research on IO change and research on the state closer together (Barnett 2002).15 This promises to be a fruitful starting point for theorising local orders in IOs beyond the WHO case.",

As this article has shown, fragmentation not only undermines coordination between organisations, but also coherent action by individual organisations. Starting from the puzzle that the GPA's \u2018mission shrink\u2019 poses for established explanations of IO change, I have proposed an alternative conceptualisation of IOs \u2014 not as actors, but as \u2018open systems\u2019 that transact with their environments through multiple and decentralised organisational channels. This turn to agency at rather than within IO boundaries brings to the fore the trans-organisational coalitions that are forged between organisational units and supporters in the IO environment. These coalitions establish their own local orders and may control different sources of power, both formal and material. Thus, I have argued that local coalitions are most likely to make a difference for IO change where states\u2019 formal and material power resources do not coincide, which makes them dependent on alliances with power holders within the organisation. The GPA case illustrates these claims as it was a major coalitional shift that caused the programme's surprising contraction.",

            "text": "Beyond solving the GPA puzzle, I have used this and further observations from WHO to systematise the local orders approach to IO change and distinguished trans-organisational coalitions according to the veto power and material resources controlled by them. I have argued that these types of coalitions tend to be linked with different types of IO agency and change. Obviously, this rough typology needs to be specified and refined in future research. Organisational interest constellations and decision rules vary across contexts, and thus can spur quite different dynamics of organisational change. Thus, the categories offered in this heuristic can serve as a starting point, but certainly not the endpoint of research into trans-organisational coalitions. In particular, the question of reform and endogenous change has to be addressed in future research. Material power and organisational veto may be empirically distinguishable, but can still be causally interrelated, as when powerful states manage to reform IO decision rules in their favour. The reform history of IOs such as the UN suggests that this is not a typical development and that formal privileges can easily be protected against powerful challengers (Hosli et al. 2011). Yet, the question remains whether formal control and material resources interact to reinforce or undermine each other. Research along these lines can enhance our understanding of the drivers of IO change beyond the PA dichotomy, the analytical fruitfulness of which has come under increasing attack in recent years.",

In particular, inter-organisation relationships and coalitional dynamics can be grasped with quantitative network analysis techniques, which have recently gained prominence in International Relations (IR) research (Hafner-Burton et al. 2009). In IR scholarship, network analysis is mostly applied to investigate ties between nations (Maoz 2011). However, it could equally be used to map trans-organisational ties and explore the nodes and positions resulting from trans-organisational networks. This would allow researchers to assess whether formal, hierarchical \u2018centrality\u2019 is reflected in various types of empirical centrality in organisations (cf. Hafner-Burton et al. 2009: 563\u20135). Such research would require detailed empirical data on the ties between organisational actors, but may well pay off with astonishing insights into the actual transactions and relationships in and across IOs.",
