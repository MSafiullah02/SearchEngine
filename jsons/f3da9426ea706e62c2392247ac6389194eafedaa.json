These fragmented proteins produce organism-specifi c spectra ( 4 ), which are compared against a reference database of spectra ( 5 ) for organism identifi cation differences in the protein composition of an organism, and the differences in protein composition can be resolved by MALDI-TOF MS. The technology works by using the laser to create a cloud of ions to which a current is applied and released into a fl ight chamber. The ions are generated from the bacterial isolate that has been smeared onto a target slide and overlaid with a matrix solution (typically \u03b1-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid). The matrix solution is critical for even distribution of the laser energy, generation of primarily singly charged ions, and reproducible results. The process of using smeared bacterial isolates is often referred to as whole cell or intact cell MS (WCMS or ICMS) [ 21 , 22 ] . As the ions travel through the fl ight chamber they are separated according to their size and charge, with the smallest and most highly charged particles moving fastest through the chamber. The ions strike a detector at the end of the chamber, and a spectrum is generated that provides the relative quantity of ions of a particular mass-charge ratio. These spectra are algorithmically compared to a reference database with identity and confi dence values assigned. Much like 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the strength of this application relies on a robust reference database for comparison [ 18 ] . Several studies have shown that identifi cation rates signifi cantly increase after database augmentation [ 23 -25 ] . Also, much as quality sequence reads are necessary for identifi cation, high quality spectra are a must for good reference matching and identifi cation. Ideal spectra for identifi cation typically consist of proteins in the 2-20 kDa range, which is rich in ribosomal and other cytoplasmic proteins. Obtaining quality spectra using WCMS can be diffi cult with organisms such as mycobacteria, fi lamentous fungi, and yeasts, due to their rigid cell walls [ 18 , 26 ] . Therefore, these organisms must undergo an additional extraction step to make the internal cellular proteins more accessible for ionization. The most basic extraction step is to apply a formic acid solution to the smeared spot and allow it to dry before adding the matrix solution. Higher order bacteria, such as mycobacteria and Nocardia spp., and fi lamentous fungi require a more rigorous extraction, typically involving bead beating, formic acid, and acetonitrile treatments [ 27 ] . In general, MALDI-TOF MS performs well, typically identifying >90 % of routine organisms to the correct species [ 18 , 28 , 29 ] .

Nonetheless, research use only products are available for direct testing of blood. Roche Molecular Systems SeptiFast (Branchburg, NJ) uses multiplex realtime PCR and melt curve analysis, while the Molzym SepsiTest (Bremen, Germany) uses multiplex PCR followed by sequencing, and the SIRS-Lab Vyoo (Jena, Germany) uses multiplex PCR followed by gel electrophoresis. These products vary in both the organisms and the resistance determinants detected, as well as analytical performance characteristics [ 60 -64 ] . In general, these products suffer from both a lack of sensitivity and specifi city, as well as requiring additional optimization before routine clinical use is possible. Other shortcomings of NAA-based diagnosis of sepsis include the inconclusive clinical signifi cance of the detection of pathogen DNA in the blood stream and the inability to obtain full antimicrobial susceptibility results [ 62 ] . However, blood culture is an imperfect reference method, suffering from a number of limitations including a prolonged time to pathogen identifi cation, effects of variable blood volume, and lack of growth for fastidious pathogens or in the presence of prior antimicrobial therapy [ 62 ] .

In brief, bacterial cells are immobilized in agarose and subjected to proteolytic degradation followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. The resulting genomic fragments are separated by PFGE which allows for better resolution of high molecular weight products [ 69 ] . PFGE is a critical tool for infection control and public health specialties, as a proven reproducible method to show strain relatedness and identify outbreaks. Other common approaches to molecular epidemiology include amplifi ed fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis and multi locus sequence typing (MLST) [ 70 ] . AFLP analysis is based on the same theory as PFGE: differences in DNA sequence can be identifi ed by differences in restriction endonuclease patterns. The major difference between AFLP analysis and PFGE is that PFGE looks at the entire genome of an organism, while AFLP analysis emphasizes regions of the genome known to have high rates of polymorphisms. MLST analysis is done by amplifying and sequencing a small set of known housekeeping genes (usually 7-14) that have a standard rate of genetic variability. These labor-intensive, and often expensive, approaches to molecular epidemiology have their disadvantages. Although PFGE has high discriminatory power, it is not very reproducible even amongst members of the same laboratory. This variability makes longitudinal comparisons diffi cult and often requires the same strains to be run repeatedly and/or implementation of a standard strain to normalize banding patterns. Although MLST analysis is very reproducible, it lacks the discriminatory power that more genome wide approaches such as AFLP analysis and PFGE offer. AFLP analysis tries to combine the discriminatory power of PFGE with the reproducibility of MLST analysis, with some success, but this approach is not applicable to all organisms [ 68 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 132, "text": "[ 68 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 400, "end": 406, "text": "[ 69 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 722, "end": 728, "text": "[ 70 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1992, "text": "[ 68 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Molecular Epidemiology"}, {"text": "MALDI-TOF MS represents a promising development for the fi eld of molecular epidemiology, providing a relatively fast and easy method of comparing strain relatedness, with minimal hands-on time.
