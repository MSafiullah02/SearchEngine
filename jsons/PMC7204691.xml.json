Alongside investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and rational design of effective therapies (xxxx). Our immune systems will need to adapt unaided to COVID-19, until a potential vaccine is available.",

The immune system plays a critical role in our response against infectious disease. The immune system is the body\u2019s multi-level defence network against potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and other organisms. The role of psychosocial factors in increasing susceptibility to viral respiratory tract infection is well documented (Acharya, 1992).

The Ayurveda pays larger emphasis on building strength of mind and body to cope with various stressors, including infection. Similar to innate and acquired immunity, the Ayurveda concept of immunity (Bala\n or strength) is classified as natural (Sahaja), chronobiologic (Kalaja), and acquired (Yuktikrut) (Balasubramani et al., 2011).",

Online document at: http://ayush.gov.in/event/ayurveda-immunity-boosting-measures-self-care-during-covid-19-crisis, accessed April 10, 2020). These interventions can be quickly implemented on large scale with the advantages of simplicity, affordability, and acceptability. This is clearly evident that such traditional measures can positively influence mental health and immune function through modulating psychoneuroimmune pathways. Presently, several allopathic drugs are under investigations for prophylactic use against COVID-19 and it seems current prophylactic measures are insufficient. The prophylactic and therapeutic potential of traditional and complementary medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Yoga can be proven effective prophylaxis and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.",
