As this is a rapidly evolving pandemic with a paucity of data to drive clinical decisions and protect healthcare workers, The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, North American COVID-19 ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NACMI). The primary objective of this registry is to create a multi-center database of patients who present with ST segment elevation or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG with a clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia and are COVID-19 positive or persons under investigation (PUI) (Figure 1\n). The secondary objectives of this registry are to compare the demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of confirmed COVID 19 patients with PUI subsequently confirmed negative and with a propensity matched historical control of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium (Figure 1). Ultimately, we plan to develop data-driven treatment plans to inform guidelines. While it is expected some PUI included in the registry will subsequently test negative for COVID-19, they represent an important subset of patients with implications for resource and personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization during this unprecedented pandemic.",

These implications are amplified by the current supply shortage of PPE. Furthermore, depending on the type of specimen collected, false negative rates of up to 30% has been reported in detecting COVID 19.26 Therefore, the registry will include both COVID-19 positive patients and PUI with ST elevation. Comparison of PUI subsequently confirmed positive to those subsequently confirmed negative will provide a unique insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism of STEMI from COVID-19, including myocarditis and prothrombotic states. Comparison of patients enrolled in NACMI to propensity matched non-COVID STEMI controls for 1 year prior will provide critical information regarding etiology, treatment strategies and clinical outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic. As testing for COVID-19 becomes more rapid, this decision-making process is expected to evolve. Additionally, it has been reported that overall STEMI volumes have decreased in the COVID-19 era, without a clear understanding of the reasons.27\n,\n28 It may be that patients are delaying their presentation to the hospital, potentially leading to need for mechanical circulatory support in the acute setting, mechanical complications of STEMI, sudden death or an increased heart failure population. Additionally, if patients are presenting later in their clinical course, NACMI registry data will allow practitioners to improve care models to improve time to treatment in this unique era.",

This brings into question role of selection bias and whether our multi-center database reflects real-world experience. However, given that over 100 sites have responded with interest and they vary in geography, prevalence of COVID 19, and systems of health care delivery in United States and Canada, we believe we will get a meaningful look at the presentation and management of ST segment elevation in this patient population. We recognize that management of COVID 19 confirmed or suspected patients presenting with ST segment elevation is not static and will change over time due to many factors including availability of PPE, intensive care unit beds, community access to testing, better understanding of disease process, and different phases of enforcing and/or easing of social restrictions. We plan to better appreciate these temporal trends by subsequent analyses of crisis and containment phase. Finally, one may assume that a more accurate comparator to our proposed historical cohort would be a contemporaneous cohort of all patients presenting with STEMI during this pandemic (including those not suspected of having COVID 19). However, it was considered not feasible for many sites to capture all patients with STEMI. Furthermore, the current approach to patients presenting with STEMI is highly variable with some centers treating all patients presenting with STEMI as PUI irrespective of screening results while other centers have instituted no change to their STEMI protocols if patients screen negative for COVID 19.",
