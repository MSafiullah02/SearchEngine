Epidemiological studies have identified several environmental risk factors in MS, including exposure to certain viruses and smoking; conversely, the lack of exposure to sunlight is correlated with an increased risk for MS. While most of these factors are associated with the susceptibility to developing MS, more recent studies show that some of these factors also impact on the MS disease course.",

Given the many possible factors that may influence MS susceptibility and disease course, studies need to be large enough and the data needs to be of high quality to determine the impact of individual possible risk factors. For example, diet and the exposure to organic solvents may play a role in MS, but the investigation of these risk factors is difficult, because high quality data on these factors over a long observation period is often not available. The results of studies on these factors, are therefore less reliable and sometimes contradictory [1], [2], [3], [4].",

An alternate hypothesis infers that the initial dysfunction is within the CNS and need not be immunological or inflammatory; potential pathologic processes include mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons or oligodendrocytes, axonal energy insufficiency, or inactivation of neural organelles such as peroxisomes [6]. Following the initial injury, the leakage of CNS antigens into draining lymph nodes contributes to the activation of T cells and other immune cell subsets that enter the CNS. Thus, whatever the origin of MS pathology, the result is the activation and recruitment of immune cell subsets into the CNS which then produce the hallmarks of MS pathology: demyelination, oligodendrocyte loss, and axonal/neuronal injury and loss [7].",

Commonly, a pathogen in exposed tissues is engulfed and broken down by antigen presenting cells (APC) such as dendritic cells. The APCs then migrate to lymph nodes, carrying a short segment of the pathogen, the antigen, bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the cell surface. In the lymph nodes, the antigen is presented to na\u00efve T cells such that those with T-cell receptors (TCR) recognizing the antigen/MHC combination become initially engaged. The antigen/MHC and TCR interaction constitutes a first signal.

CD4 + T cells are particularly interesting in MS as they can differentiate into pro-inflammatory T helper (Th) 1 or 17 subsets, anti-inflammatory Th2 cells, or into cells with regulatory/anti-inflammatory properties (Tregs), depending on the microenvironment and cytokine milieu [8]. CD4 + T cells in MS patients tend to differentiate into Th1 and/or Th17 subsets, which are not only pro-inflammatory [9], but potentially neurotoxic as well [10]. In contrast to the propensity to generate Th1/17, there is an apparent deficiency of the regulatory/anti-inflammatory Th2 and Tregs subsets in MS, on the whole favoring a pro-inflammatory milieu [11]. Besides the CD4 + subsets, CD8 + T cells also have several tissue damaging roles in MS [12].",

After crossing the endothelial cell barrier, immune cells readily cross the endothelial basement membrane. Then, in the presence of proteolytic activity largely furnished by the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), they migrate across a second basement membrane barrier, the glia limitans or parenchymal basement membrane, into the CNS parenchyma (Fig. 1). Without proteolytic activity, immune cells are trapped in the perivascular space that separates both basement membrane layers [18]. However, MMPs are upregulated in MS which facilitates the transmigration of activated immune cells into the CNS parenchyma [19]. MMPs themselves are induced by an upstream switch, Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer, EMMPRIN (CD147) [20].",

Interestingly, the antibody indices for measles, rubella, varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus were all higher than those for EBV. This suggests that the humoral immune response that elevates EBV titers in MS is not exclusively directed against EBV antigens but is part of a general polyspecific immune response [35].

The hypothesis postulates that upon exposure to a pathogen, the pathogen/MHC conformation on an APC bears molecular similarity to that of a endogenous peptide, such as a fragment from myelin basic protein (MBP), presented within an MHC. If co-stimulatory molecules are properly engaged, the result could be the expansion and differentiation of not only the pathogen-reactive T cells, a properly directed immune response, but also the expansion of MBP-reactive T cells, an improper outcome. If both pools differentiate into Th1 or Th17 pro-inflammatory subsets (Fig. 1), these can become reactivated within the CNS to promote pathology. In support of this idea, T cell lines isolated from MS patients demonstrate cross-reactivity between MBP and coronavirus [41] or EBV [42] antigens. Moreover, crystal structure analyses revealed a significant degree of structural similarity between the DRB5*0101-EBV peptide complex to the DRB1*1501-MBP peptide complex at the cell surface for TCR recognition [43].",

MS subjects have antibodies that cross-react between MBP and EBV [46], providing a mechanism by which EBV-reactive antibodies may disrupt myelin. Moreover, cellular immune responses such as EBV-reactive CD8 + T cells that are restricted by HLA-B7, a common allele in MS, are dysregulated in MS [47]. Pender has postulated an initial CD8 + T cell deficiency in MS that impairs the capacity to control EBV infection with the result that EBV-infected B cells accumulate in the CNS where they produce pathogenic autoantibodies and provide survival signals to autoreactive T cells [48].",

An analysis of data collected by general practitioners however suggested that smoking is associated with a greater risk of evolving to a secondary progressive course (hazard ratio (HR): 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3\u20139.9) [60]. The most recent large hospital based cohort-study also found smoking to be associated with the risk of secondary progression (HR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.42\u20134.41), but not with an increase in EDSS scores [58]; and in a prospective Australian study, smoking was associated with an increase in EDSS scores during two years of follow-up [61]. Thus, while it appears that smoking influences the early disease course of MS, more research is needed to ascertain its relative impact on early versus late disease stages of MS.",

The latter then undergoes 2 hydroxylations, most notably in the liver and kidney by d-25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) and 25-hydroxyvitamin d-1\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), to produce the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.

In rats that are deficient of vitamin D during gestation, abnormal brain development such as alteration of brain shape and enlargement of lateral ventricle volume has been observed. Mice with gestational vitamin D deficiency have impaired learning in adulthood [87]. In tissue culture, glutamate excitotoxicity to cortical, cerebellar or hippocampal neurons is reduced by vitamin D [88]. To what extent these neuroprotective activities of vitamin D account for its effect in MS remains to be clarified. Overall, there is substantial evidence that vitamin D corrects many of the immune abnormalities seen in MS.

An initial activation of T cells by antigen presenting cells in the periphery [1], particularly in lymph nodes, leads to the increased generation of Th1 and/or Th17 pro-inflammatory subsets in MS. These cells, and other leukocyte subsets including monocytes and B cells, transit in blood where they can adhere [2] onto inflamed endothelial cells (EC). Predominantly at post-capillary venules in the CNS, the leukocyte populations produce MMPs to invade [3] across the glia limitans into the CNS parenchyma. T cells may undergo reactivation within the CNS and they, together with other leukocyte populations that have entered the CNS, contribute to tissue injury [4]. This figure also displays where the environmental factors that influence MS may act in the cascade of immunopathogenesis.",
