            "text": "Alphaviruses are membrane enveloped viruses, which consists of a single-stranded RNA as a genetic material and an icosahedral-like nucleocapsid of size (60\u201370 nm).1 Genetically, the CHIKV possess an enveloped structure with a single-stranded, positive RNA genome.25, 45, 48 Additionally, the CHIKV genome is approximately 11.8 kb long and comprises two open reading frames (ORFs) a 5\u2032 end ORF capable to encode the four viral non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4) and a 3\u2032 end ORF that encodes the viral structural proteins including capsid (C), two major enveloped (E) glycoproteins, E1 and E2, and two smaller accessories peptides, E3 and 6K which and envelope proteins.27, 39, 48, 49, 50 nsP1 is involved in viral mRNA capping via its guanine-7-methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase enzymatic activities.25, 32 In addition, the viral nsP2 protein has other enzymatic functions including RNA helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) and RNA-dependent 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities which are located at the N-terminus of the protein, while the protease domain is located at the C-terminus nsP3 acts as part of the replicase unit and an accessory protein involved in RNA synthesis.15, 27, 51 Finally, nsP4 acts as RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase.27, 32, 52 The enveloped proteins E1 and E2 are responsible for formation of glycoproteins spikes on the viral particle surface and facilitate the binding of the viral particle to susceptible host cells (mutations of Alanine to Valine (Ala226Val) in the E1 enveloped glycoprotein result in a new CHIKV strain that became more prevalent as the epidemic progressed)48, 53 (Fig. 1\n). Additionally, it is known which alterations of Glycine407 to Arginine in the E2 protein (Gly407Arg) are responsible for observed CHIKV resistance to arbidol drug, and they also regulate CHIKV adaptation.54, 55, 56 Additionally, the CHIKV surface consists of 80 trimeric spikes composed of heterodimers of the envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) in the lipid bilayer.57 CHIKV 6K is small, hydrophobic protein essential for the viral particle assembly, which acts as a signal sequence for the processing of the E1 protein. The role of 6 K protein in viral replication is not fully resolved. Capsid protein is 261 amino acids (30 kDa) long, expressed as a part of the structural polyprotein, which has a conserved autoprotease domain at the C-terminal end that helps to release itself from the polypeptide string after synthesis of structural proteins.1 In sequence, occurs the entry of the CHIKV virus via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and uncoating of the viral genome. Translation of viral RNA leads the viral non-structural protein complex, replicating the CHIKV RNA genome.48 Then, this step is followed by translation of viral structural proteins and assembly of viral components within the cytoplasm.48 Finally, viral particles bud out through the plasma membrane, forming mature, infectious progeny.48 There are three genotypes, namely Asian (Asian), Eastern Central South African (ECSA), and West African (WA) strains.45, 58\n",

Based on screening studies, the thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole family presented promising anti-CHIKV activity, and this was used to prepare different active analogs (Table 11\n).

Additionally, it was investigated the inhibitory effects of an irreversible furin peptide, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk (205), Fig. 19\n) on CHIKV infection of a human muscle satellite cells. Interestingly, it was observed a strong inhibition of CHIKV entry when pretreating the cells with convertase inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk. Consequently, pretreatment of muscle cells with dec-RVKR-cmk should not have affected virus entry and the number of infected foci.61\n",

One of the chemical samples, coded by TR247, portrayed an interesting activity/cytotoxicity. Applying high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLS-MS) analysis was found that the hit sample was a 1:1 mixture of two compounds. Subsequently, both entities were separated using chromatography, structurally characterized, and individually evaluated for anti-CHIKV activity.
