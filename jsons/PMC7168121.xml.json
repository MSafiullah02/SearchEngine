Consequently, we did not identify asthmatic children with adenovirus infection in our study.

In children < 2 years of age, RSV infection was frequently found in association with acute wheezing and respiratory distress, often requiring hospitalization. In older children, RSV infection was also commonly associated with wheezing. However, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus are also significant factors in the exacerbation of wheezing.",

The observation that infants and younger children with RSV infection have symptoms of greater severity could be partly attributed to the increased number of eosinophils in the respiratory tract. Experiments with animals and clinical studies have implied that eosinophilia is associated with viral infections in asthma (9, 10). A massive infiltration of eosinophils has been observed in asthmatic patients during viral infection (11). Thus, eosinophil infiltration is considered to be a crucial element of the pathology leading to clinical exacerbation of asthma. Furthermore, recent research has proposed that analysis of the respiratory mucosa secretion is a more accurate diagnostic test than measurement of blood eosinophils for detecting airway eosinophilic inflammation (12). Therefore, our result from testing NPS eosinophils was more reliable for reflecting the airway inflammation of asthmatic children.",

In our study we did not detect eosinophilia in the NPS or in blood among influenza A\u2010infected patients, in contrast to that caused by RSV infection.",
