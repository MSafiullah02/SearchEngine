The history of man is replete with stories of epidemics invading groups of people, sometimes resulting in mortality. In the long run, such diseases can disappear and recur in the future or become less deadly due to people getting immune. Some notable epidemics in history include the \u201cSpanish\u201d flu (1918\u20131919) as well as the Black Deaths (1346\u20131350) which invaded Europe from Asia and recurred for three decades afterwards before getting eliminated (Brauer, 2017).",

For instance, as of March 2015, Japan was confirmed to be totally free of measles. However, that status changed when a new wave of measles infections was reportedly started by a tourist in Okinawa Prefecture in March 2018 (Mizumoto, Kobayashi, Chowell, 2018, Diseases, 2018). The threat of measles is a serious one because it has about the highest basic reproduction number R\n0 among the most commonly known infectious diseases (van den Driessche, 2017). It has been established that R\n0 is a very vital threshold parameter that theoretically determines whether a disease is eliminated or becomes endemic after it is introduced into a given population. In fact, it is widely believed to be one of the most important contributions of mathematics to the field of epidemiology (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, Roberts, 2010, Heffernan, Smith, Wahl, 2005, van den Driessche, Watmough, 2002). Heffernan et al. (2005) gave a concise summary of prevalent approaches for formulating R\n0 from deterministic models as well as relevant data. They also looked closely at the use of R\n0 in evaluating diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza as well as some livestock and vector-borne diseases. van den Driessche (2017) applied the theoretical concepts of R\n0 to various disease models, namely the West Nile virus in birds, anthrax in animals, cholera and Zika in humans.",

In the frequently referred paper by van den Driessche and Watmough (2002), very helpful results were obtained for disease control having investigated the actual definition of R\n0 based on a compartmental system of ordinary differential equations. Diekmann et al. (2010) highlighted the NGM as the foundation for the mathematical definition of R\n0. As such, their work attempted to demystify issues surrounding the formulation of NGMs since R\n0s are basically defined as the spectral radii of such matrices. We should recognize that, as described above, the basic reproduction number is defined both biologically/conceptually and mathematically as the supremum for the expected number of secondary cases in epidemic dynamics, whereas it is clear that the index R\n0 could be important and useful to characterize the threat of infectious diseases.",

The R\n0 focused on residents can be considered as the most standard case as it may be a bit difficult to really estimate the impact of short-stay visitors in the spread of diseases. The R\n0 focused on short-stay visitors is very important when the residents are considered as some vectors in the community which can easily spread diseases to visitors. That way, we can make inferences by combining different R\n0s. Besides we shall demonstrate that R\n0 only deals with the initial behavior of infections because the overall behavior is governed by the model under consideration.",

From the biological definitions of Rvr,\nRvv, and Rrv, the initial single infective resident is expected to produce Rvr infective visitors, and subsequently each of these infective visitors is expected to produce Rvv infective visitors. Looking at the furtherance of the infection process only within the visitor subpopulation caused by the initial single infective resident, the simple addition of those new infective visitors produced by the cascade of infections results in Rvr+RvvRvr+Rvv2Rvr+\u22ef.

We remark again that R0\u2223v\u2192\u221e as Rrr increases towards 1, which can be interpreted as a consequence due to the divergence of the sum Rrv+RrrRrv+Rrr2Rrv+\u22ef for Rrr \u2265 1. This scenario is different from the previous one because the infective residents eventually disappear in the end for Rrr > 1 after every resident is infected and recovers. However, we need to recall that the basic reproduction number is defined as the expected number of secondary cases in the conceptually supremum case for the subsequent infections. Thus, this result can be understood as the case when the basic reproduction number of the resident subpopulation corresponding to Rrr is kept beyond 1. As such, the visitor subpopulation is regarded as always being exposed to infective residents by cross infection (which corresponds to the divergence of the above-mentioned sum). This situation could indicate that the threat of disease spread in the visitor subpopulation is enormous.",

For poultry and other possible local hosts of avian influenza, screening or culling as established by (Liu and Fang, 2015) can help in preventing the disease outbreak in the local community.",

            "text": "In the past couple of decades, most papers related to theoretical/mathematical studies of the global spread of transmissible diseases were focused on the mobility of humans over various populations or patches (see Arino, van den Driessche, 2006, Colizza, Vespignani, 2008, Gong, Small, 2018, Saito, Nishiura, Higuchi, 2018, Soriano-Pa\u00f1os, Lotero, Arenas, G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es, 2018, Wang, Wu, 2018 and references therein). Frequently, such movements correspond to migration as opposed to temporary visits for a finite period as we consider in our case, or to human transportation on a large spatial scale during relatively long trips. Our scenario of short visits does not fully capture the metapopulation framework in most of those previous works but the interaction between the resident and visitor subpopulations has some semblance of metapopulation behavior. Indeed, the two subpopulations may be regarded as patches between which diseases can spread. This may be said to display some metapopulation dynamics in the context of modern trends in social networks (Hackl, Dubernet, 2019, Wang, Wang, Wu, 2018) while metapopulation dynamics have been generally based on a spatially heterogeneous structure of population distribution (Arino, van den Driessche, 2006, Ball, Britton, House, Isham, Mollison, Pellis, Scalia Tomba, 2015, North, Godfray, 2017).",

In this sense, the analysis of our model can be regarded as being about the likelihood of the spread of a transmissible disease in a community which corresponds to a patch. It is necessary to discuss such a likelihood over a metapopulation especially when an transnational or global-scale outbreak is concerned, whereas even in such a case, each local community in the metapopulation must consider the likelihood of spread within the community in order to prevent or contain it as mentioned in the last part of Section 5.2.
