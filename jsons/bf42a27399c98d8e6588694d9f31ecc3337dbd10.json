Drug repurposing is a feasible method for emergency treatment. As low-molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand-and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (M pro ), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of M pro . Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of M pro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low-molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.",

Main protease (M pro or 3CL pro ) is one of the most extensively studied targets of coronaviruses 4 . M pro plays an essential role in the cleavage of viral RNA-translated virus polypeptide 5 and recognizes at least 11 cleavage sites in replicase polyprotein 1ab, e.g., LQ\uf0afSAG (\uf0afdenotes the cleavage site). Covalent inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M pro have recently demonstrated potency toward inhibiting viral replication in cellular assays 6, 7 ; this further underpins the druggability of M pro . However, these compounds remain in the early stages of preclinical studies, and the development of new drugs usually takes years. The lack of drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2currently poses a threat to numerous COVID-19 patients.",

Therefore, the possibility of uncovering a highly potent and specific drug against the SARS-CoV-2 is quite slim.

            "text": "-18 , we characterized weak target-ligand interactions using ligand-observed spectra, e.g., saturation transfer difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY. Three hits for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro were identified (Figure 1a): niacin, hit 1, and hit 2 (Figure 1b). The potency of these three hits was then evaluated using enzymatic activity assay of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro (Figure 1c). Niacin and hit 1 moderately inhibited the cleavage of fluorescent-labeled polypeptide (FITC-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2) by the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . To further map the binding sites of niacin and hit 1, we determined the chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of 15 N-labeled M pro induced by the titration of these two compounds. Due to the severe signal overlap in the heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of the 15 N labeled full-length SARS-CoV-2 M pro (residue 4-306), the N-terminal domain(M pro -N) with the catalytic core included(residues 4-199) was used instead for all the protein-observed NMR studies conducted thereafter. The well-dispersed HSQC spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro -N enabled many 1 H-15 N amide chemical shift assignments transferred directly from SARS-CoV M pro -N",
