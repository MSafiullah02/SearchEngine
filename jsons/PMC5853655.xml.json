A patient was considered to have RSV LRTI if they had an RSV-positive lower respiratory tract sample (ie, bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], a lung biopsy specimen, or an autopsy specimen) with or without radiographic abnormalities (defined as proven or probable LRTI, respectively) or an RSV-positive upper respiratory tract sample with radiographic abnormalities (defined as possible LRTI). The day of RSV LRTI diagnosis was defined as the date when RSV was detected in the lower respiratory tract specimen (for cases of proven/probable LRTI) or the date the radiographic abnormality was detected (for cases of possible LRTI). Virologic confirmation was obtained by direct fluorescent antibody testing, shell vial centrifugation, or conventional viral culture of lower respiratory tract samples; after 2007, patients also had RSV detected by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis [17].",

Supplemental oxygen was administered per standardized clinical nursing protocols at our center. A supplemental oxygen\u2013free day was defined as any 24-hour period during which a subject received \u22642 L of supplemental oxygen per minute (sustained for a continuous 48-hour period) while the patient was alive. The impact of death on the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days was evaluated using 2 definitions. For definition 1, the day of death and subsequent days up to 28 days following presentation were not considered supplemental oxygen-free days. For definition 2, if a subject died, none of the 28 days were considered supplemental oxygen\u2013free days (ie, the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days was 0).",

The probability of overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the log-rank test was used to compare mortality curves between groups. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the time to first use of supplemental oxygen and the time to mechanical ventilation. Covariates evaluated as candidate risk factors for inclusion in multivariable models are listed in Table 1 and were selected a priori. Variables with a P value of \u2264 0.2 in univariable analysis were candidates for multivariable models and were retained in the models if they remained significant themselves or modified the effect of another factor (confounder). The median numbers of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days while alive were compared among groups and within groups, divided into those with possible LRTI versus those proven/probable LRTI, by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Two-sided P values of <.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Sample size estimates were calculated using a 2-sided Pearson \u03c72 test, for mortality by day 28, and 2-sided t tests, for the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days by day 28, with an \u03b1 of 0.05 and 80% power.

Table 4 provides sample size estimates comparing mortality and number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days by day 28 for subjects developing or presenting with proven/probable LRTI (proven/probable from groups 2 and 3). Based on a baseline 28-day mortality rate of 26% in subjects with proven/probable LRTI, a reduction by a conservative estimate of 10% (to a 28-day mortality rate of 16%) would require a sample size of 221 subjects per arm (with a type 1 error of 5% and a power of 80%). In contrast, a conservative increase in the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days from 16 (the observed mean number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days in patients with proven/probable LRTI) to 22 would require 64 subjects per arm. Additional sample size calculations for more and less conservative changes in mortality and number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days are shown in Table 4, with similarly lower sample sizes required in the supplemental oxygen\u2013free day endpoint.",

            "text": "RSV infection in HCT recipients has historically been associated with significant mortality, with death rates of up to 55% in patients with LRTI [9\u201311]. However, mortality rates have been declining, presumably because of changes in transplantation practices, such as declining use of myeloablative regimens and improved supportive care practices. Additionally, previous studies of RSV in HCT recipients have used different definitions of LRTI which may account for wide variations in endpoints, including progression to LRTI, supplemental oxygen use, and mortality [1, 10, 11, 15, 18]. Current guidelines also include possible LRTI in recommendations for management of RSV [19]. Furthermore, differences exist among transplant centers in the use of BAL for diagnosing LRTI due to respiratory viruses. In the present study, we sought to characterize clinical outcomes both by the clinical status at the time of presentation to care (ie, URTI [group 1], URTI with progression to LRTI [group 2], and LRTI [group 3]) and by the site of virologic detection (URTI only, possible LRTI, probable LRTI, or proven LRTI). We found substantial differences in supplemental oxygen use, the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days, and mortality between subjects with and those without RSV detected in the lower respiratory tract. Our data demonstrate that subjects with possible LRTI required very little supplemental oxygen and had no deaths and that they are more similar to subjects with URTI only, regardless of initial presentation. Conversely, patients with proven/probable LRTI are the only subjects who died and had significantly higher use of supplemental oxygen. These data are consistent with a previous study evaluating parainfluenza virus LRTI in HCT recipients, in which outcomes in possible LRTI cases were significantly better than in proven/probable LRTI cases [16]. Taken together, these data suggest that a less conservative approach to defining LRTI without determining whether RSV is truly in the lower respiratory tract (in cases where imaging findings are abnormal) may be clinically misleading and contributes to the finding that mortality rates appear to have decreased among patients with a diagnosis of RSV LRTI.",

            "text": "The number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days as an endpoint was also evaluated in the current study. Supplemental oxygen use correlates with acute lung injury, which, in turn, is associated with mortality in HCT recipients [15, 20, 21]. Additionally, supplemental oxygen use typically requires hospitalization; thus, the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days represent a composite endpoint that takes into account disease severity, need for hospitalization, and mortality. Our data showed significant decreases in supplemental oxygen\u2013free days in subjects with any LRTI as compared to those with URTI, and further decreases were seen in subjects with proven/probable LRTI as compared to those with possible LRTI. Ventilator-free days were first defined in the 1990s and then introduced to the ARDSNet in 2002 by Schoenfeld et al [22, 23], and they have been used as an end point extensively in the intensive care unit literature. Several studies, including randomized controlled trials [24\u201327] and limited studies of viral infections such as enteroviruses [28], influenza virus [29, 30], and herpes viruses [31] in critically ill patients, have since used this end point. Our definition of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days is consistent with Schoenfeld\u2019s original definition for ventilator-free days in acute respiratory distress syndrome [23], with 2 notable exceptions. First, given the low rates of mechanical ventilation in this cohort (7% overall), our study was not sufficiently powered to evaluate ventilator-free days and thus evaluated supplemental oxygen\u2013free days. Generally, patients receiving >2 L of supplementary oxygen per minute require hospital admission, and thus an increasing number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days still represents significant healthcare cost savings. Second, the effect of death was evaluated both with the traditional definition (wherein death at any point during the 28-day period gives a score of 0 supplemental oxygen\u2013free days for that subject) and with a definition that allows any days prior to death during which no supplemental oxygen was used to be counted as supplemental oxygen\u2013free days. This second definition was used, given the high levels of competing risk of death in transplant recipients. Ultimately, only 3 subjects had any supplemental oxygen\u2013free days prior to death, and thus mean and median supplemental oxygen\u2013free days did not vary greatly with use of either definition.",

The lowest median number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days occurred in patients presenting with proven/probable LRTI (13 days), followed by subjects with proven/probable LRTI regardless of presentation (17 days). In contrast, subjects with possible LRTI in either group 2 or 3 had a median of 29 supplemental oxygen\u2013free days, the same as subjects with URTI only. These data, along with mortality outcomes outlined above, suggest that the prognosis of HCT recipients with RSV detected in the upper respiratory tract and radiographic abnormalities requires sampling of the lower respiratory tract (eg, BAL) to determine whether proven LRTI is present. Confirmation of RSV LRTI with BAL can provide useful prognostic information and may help stratify patients by risk and help prioritize expensive and intensive therapeutic options. Currently, ribavirin is the only antiviral available for specific treatment of RSV disease [10, 11, 15, 32]; however, cost remains a prohibitive barrier to its use, with an estimated cost of greater than $250 000 for a 10-day course [33]. Risk stratification based on confirmation of probable/proven LRTI may assist in treatment considerations for HCT recipients with RSV. In addition, several antivirals are in phase 2 trials for treatment of RSV infections in various populations [5, 34\u201337], including HCT recipients [7, 8], and risk stratification may help develop rational prevention and treatment strategies for immunocompromised patients with these agents.",

The most common criticisms of use of ventilator-free days as an endpoint is lack of consensus definitions and high levels of heterogeneity, thus making comparisons among studies difficult [38\u201341]. Because this is the first-time that supplemental oxygen\u2013free days has been evaluated for RSV infection in HCT recipients and because this is a single center study, further studies that implement strict criteria for evaluating the need for supplemental oxygen and apply consistent definitions are needed.

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective review, and the use of BAL to evaluate LRTI is largely based on protocols at our center, which recommend BAL when RSV is detected in the upper respiratory tract and radiographic abnormalities are present. However, the decision to pursue bronchoscopy is ultimately left to the attending physician, and thus some potential probable or proven cases may have been missed. Despite this inherent limitation in capturing the proven/probable LRTI cases, we demonstrated differences in clinical outcomes between groups. Additionally, the definition of a supplemental oxygen\u2013free day as one during which supplementation with \u22642 L of oxygen per minute was required relies on subjective clinical decisions that may not have a physiological correlate. However, the requirement of a sustained 48-hour period without use of >2 L of supplemental oxygen per minute to be deemed an supplemental oxygen\u2013free day should account for this inherent variability.",

The separation of LRTI into these groups could be useful in future outcomes research; however, validation of these results with other sites and protocols will be important. One potential application would be in cross-validating the immunodeficiency scoring index suggested for use in HCT recipients with RSV infection, to help develop consensus definitions [14]. Furthermore, by using a more conservative approach to defining LRTI and implementing supplemental oxygen\u2013free days as a surrogate clinical endpoint, we believe clinical trials may be able to use smaller sample sizes, thereby facilitating more-rapid development of novel agents to treat RSV infections in HCT recipients.",
