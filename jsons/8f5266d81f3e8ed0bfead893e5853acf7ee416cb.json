The treaties adopted in Beijing further criminalize the act of using civil aircraft as a weapon, and of using dangerous materials to attack aircraft or other targets on the ground. The unlawful transport of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and their related material 4 becomes now punishable under the treaties. Moreover, directors and organizers of attacks against aircraft and airports will have no safe haven. Making a threat against civil aviation may also trigger criminal liability. The Convention also implicitly addresses the threat of cyber attacks on aviation, as the discussion to follow will illustrate.",

Since the catastrophic events of 11 September 20012, we have seen stringent legal measures taken by the United States to attack terrorism, not just curb it. The famous phrase \"war on terror\" denotes pre-emptive and preventive strikes carried out through applicable provisions of legitimately adopted provisions of legislation. The earliest example is the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSAA) enacted by President Bush less than 2 months after the 9/11 attacks. Then, 2 months after the attacks, in November 2001, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) with a view to improving security and closing the security loopholes which existed on that fateful day in September 2001. The legislation paved the way for a huge federal body called the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) which was established within the Department of Transportation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 which followed effected a significant reorganization of the Federal Government.",

Since the events of 11 September 2001, there have been several attempts against the security of aircraft in flight. These threats have ranged from shoe bombs to dirty bombs to explosives that can be assembled in flight with liquids, aerosols and gels. In every instance the global community has reacted with preemptive and preventive measures which prohibit any material on board which might seemingly endanger the safety of flight. Some jurisdictions have even gone to extremes in prohibiting human breast milk and prescriptive medications on board.",

Grave threats such as those posed by the carriage of dangerous pathogens on board, the use of cyber technology calculated to interfere with air navigation systems, and the misuse of man portable air defence systems are real and have to be addressed with vigour and regularity. ICAO has been addressing these threats for some time and continues to do so on a global basis. 5 The Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago on 7 December 1944, which is the founding document of commercial aviation, in its Preamble, recognizes that the future development of international civil aviation can greatly help to create and preserve friendship and international understanding among the nations and peoples of the world, yet its abuse can become a threat to the general security; and it is desirable to avoid friction and to promote that cooperation between nations and peoples upon which the entire peace of the world depends. See ICAO Doc 7300/9 Ninth Edition: 2006, Preamble. The most significant modernist construction of the role of civil aviation in securing world peace and security comes from language used in the letters of invitation issued by the United States to the participant States to the Chicago Conference that, consequent to the war, the restorative processes of prompt communication may greatly facilitate the return to the processes of peace. However, the conscious awareness of the parties to the Convention, that in securing this peace, prudent economic and business principles must not be compromised, should not be forgotten. See Proceedings of the International Civil Aviation Conference, Chicago, Illinois, November 1-7 December 1944, US Department of State Volume 1 at 7. The Aviation Security Panel of ICAO met at its Twentieth Meeting in Montreal from 30 March to 3 April 2009. One of the key areas of discussion at this meeting concerned new and emerging threats to civil aviation. The Panel worked through the Working Group on New and Emerging Threats and noted that significant progress in efforts to proactively identify vulnerabilities and potential gaps in existing measures had been made, that would strengthen Annex 17 (Aviation Security) to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. At this meeting, the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) stressed the importance of the challenge posed by cyber threats in light of the current lack of related provisions in Annex 17.",

Depending on the results of the analysis, the Working Group on Amendment 12 to Annex 17 will develop a proposal for amending the Annex, to be presented to the Panel at its twenty-first meeting.",

While concern was expressed regarding the impact of unpredictable security measures on passenger confidence in aviation security, many Panel members supported implementation of the concept because of its value as a deterrent. It was suggested that States adopt an approach providing for a baseline regime, but with the addition of unpredictable measures, thus achieving a balance between certainty and unpredictability. With regard to an amendment to Annex 17 in this regard, the need for introducing unpredictability into the aviation security regime was considered, and it was agreed that unpredictability should be promoted in principle but not prescribed. The Panel suggested that if an Annex 17 specification related to unpredictability were to be developed, it would be necessary to ensure that the introduction of this concept by States does not diminish the level of security or result in delays for passengers. Further, the Panel noted that appropriate guidance material may be required to address the potential negative impact of introducing the concept of unpredictability, and proposed the development of guidance material related to unpredictability prior to the introduction of an amendment to Annex 17.",

States Parties also recognize that new types of threats against civil aviation require new concerted efforts and policies of cooperation on the part of States.

            "text": "Offences under the convention The first offence identified by the Convention relates to any person committing an offence if that person unlawfully and intentionally performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft. 9 This offence has three salient elements: the offence has to be committed by a person \"on board\" 10 an aircraft; the aircraft has to be \"in flight\"; and the act perpetrated should endanger the safety of the aircraft. According to the Convention, the aircraft is considered to be in flight at any time from the moment when all its external doors are closed following embarkation until the moment when any such door is opened for disembarkation; in the case of a forced landing, the flight shall be deemed to continue until the competent authorities take over the responsibility for the aircraft and for persons and property on board. 11 The next consideration within this specific offence is that the act perpetrated should endanger the safety of the aircraft. This seemingly excludes acts of air rage which in most instances only affect the safety of the person against whom the offence is committed. By restricting the offence to safety of the aircraft in flight, the Convention has ensured that every offence under this provision must essentially endanger the safety of the aircraft in which the offence is committed. 8 The leakages occurred in China, Taiwan and Singapore. See Air-Tight Security, Intersec, June 2007 33-35 at 34. 9 Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation, done at Beijing on 10 September 2010, Article 1 (a). 10 The offender has to be physically inside the aircraft. This offence therefore does not ex facie apply to an offence committed outside the aircraft. The Convention does not define \"on board\". However, it must be noted that the term \"on board\" has been judicially defined in absolute terms in that as long as a person is physically in the aircraft, it matters not whether the flight had been terminated or not. See Herman v. Trans World Airlines, 330 N.Y.S.D. 2nd 829 (Sup.Ct. 1972) where the Court held that although the aircraft in which the passenger was travelling had been hijacked and flown to the desert, and the passenger was kept in the aircraft for several days, he was nonetheless considered to have been on board, irrespective of whether the purpose of the flight had been fulfilled or not. See also Pfug v. Egyptair, 961 F. 2d. 26 (2nd Cir.1992). 7 An year earlier, a covert event occurred in October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent through the mail exposing persons in the eastern USA to contaminated mail resulting in deaths, illnesses and identified exposures to Anthrax. Overt, announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred, have taken place in the United States, although most of these were determined to have been hoaxes, that is, there were no true exposures to infectious agents. 11 Supra, note 10, Article 2 (a). 6 Pathogens are microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) or recombinant microorganisms (hybrid or mutant) that are known or are reasonably expected to cause infectious disease in humans or animals.",

It is interesting that the Convention does not define the words \"device\" 15 or \"substance\". 16 It is even more interesting that the Convention did not include the word \"weapon\" as it has done in a following provision. 17 The fourth offence is a first for any treaty on unlawful interference with civil aviation. It provides that an offence is committed when a person destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. 18 This undoubtedly refers, inter alia to cyber terrorism, but strangely links the offence exclusively to the safety of aircraft in flight. If therefore as a result of an act of cyber terrorism, a taxing aircraft collides with an aircraft which has opened its doors for disembarkation but the passengers are still on board awaiting disembarkation, that act would not be considered an offence in terms of the passengers in the process of disembarkation. In other words, the offender would not be committing an offence either against the second aircraft or its disembarking passengers. 13 Id, Article 2 (b).",

For instance, if a phony telephone call claims that there would be a bomb on board a flight that would be operated the next day, and the air operator cancels that flight incurring an economic loss, there would be no offence as the aircraft in question was not \"in flight\" as defined in the Convention. This consideration may be particularly relevant in the context of the title of the Treaty which is \"Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation\" which obviously does not restrict itself to safety or security issues.

In the maritime context, there are analogous provisions 23 where important safeguards are prescribed when a State Party takes measures against a ship, including boarding. The safeguards include: not endangering the safety of life at sea; ensuring that all persons on board are treated in a manner which preserves human dignity and in keeping with human rights law; taking due account of safety and security of the ship and its cargo; ensuring that measures taken are environmentally sound; and taking reasonable efforts to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed. 24 The European Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law 25 calls upon each State Party to adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences or administrative offences, liable to sanctions or other measures under its domestic law, when committed intentionally or with negligence the unlawful discharge, emission or introduction of a quantity of substances or ionising radiation into air, soil or water. 26 The next provision 27 makes it an offence to release or discharge from an aircraft in service any BCN 28 weapon or explosive, radioactive, or similar substances in a manner that causes or is likely to cause death, serious bodily injury or serious damage to property or the environment. This provision provides, inter alia a response to bio terrorism, which is a new and emerging threat to civil aviation. 29 A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant 24 Id.

(b) \"chemical weapons\", which are, together or separately: toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for: (A) industrial, agricultural, research, medical, pharmaceutical or other peaceful purposes; or (B) protective purposes, namely those purposes directly related to protection against toxic chemicals and to protection against chemical weapons; or (C) military purposes not connected with the use of chemical weapons and not dependent on the use of the toxic properties of chemicals as a method of warfare; or (D) law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes, as long as the types and quantities are consistent with such purposes; munitions and devices specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those toxic chemicals which would be released as a result of the employment of such munitions and devices; any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of munitions and devices and nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. 29 A Special Sub Committee of the Legal Committee of ICAO met in Montreal from 3 to 6 July 2007 to discuss the preparation of one or more instruments addressing new and emerging threats. One of the issues addressed at this meeting was the unlawful transport of biological, chemical, nuclear weapons and other dangerous substances on board aircraft. to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. While some bioterrorism agents, such as the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person some agents such as anthrax are incapable of doing so.",

Until recently in the United States of America, most biological defence strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than looking after ordinary people in cities. In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the co director of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \"non-traditional\" (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nation-wide.",

Article 1.4. 30 In 1984 followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh attempted to control a local election by incapacitating the local population by infecting salad bars in eleven restaurants, doorknobs, produce in grocery stores and other public domains with Salmonellas typhimurium in the city of The Dalles, Oregon.. The attack caused about 751 people to get sick (there were no fatalities). This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the 20th century. In September and October of 2001, several cases of anthrax broke out in the United States which were reportedly caused deliberately. This was a wellpublicized act of bioterrorism. It motivated efforts to define biodefense and biosecurity. 31 In 1915 and 1916, Dr Anton Dilger, a German-American physician used cultures of anthrax and glanders with the intention of committing biological sabotage on behalf of the German government. Other German agents are known to have undertaken similar sabotage efforts during World War I in Norway, Spain, Romania and Argentina. 32 Beijing Convention, supra, note 9, Article 1.2. 33 Id, Article 1. 3. penalties.

In regular parlance \"undertake\" would mean to \"accept as a challenge or promise to do or accomplish or enter upon an activity or enterprise\" 35 Another definition of \"undertake\" is \"to agree to be responsible for a job or project and do it\". 36 Therefore, logically, one could argue that Article 3 makes States Parties promise that they would make offences under the Convention punishable.
