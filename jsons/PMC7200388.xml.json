            "text": "Whilst this is an over-simplification of a complex process it goes some way to explaining the association between severe COVID-19 and age, obesity, and hypertension. As one ages, becomes more obese or hypertensive one\u2019s ACE axis is biased in the ACE1 direction which then predisposes one to severe COVID-19 [7, 8, 10]. Other pro-inflammatory pathways are also activated and likely also play a role [10]. These changes are however not inevitable with aging or irreversible. A large number of studies in humans and other animals have shown that aerobic exercise can fairly rapidly reverse this bias, regardless of one\u2019s age, sex or abdominal girth [12, 13]. Whilst the initial reversal of this bias occurs within minutes to hours of exercise, more profound reversal requires sustaining a regular program of exercise [12, 13, 14]. Exercise has also consistently been shown to be an effective way to reduce blood pressure in hypertensives [15]. A healthy, tailored diet can also play an important complementary role. As an example, randomized controlled trials have shown that certain diets can lead to remission of diabetes in up to 50% of participants [16, 17].",

One study for example found that every hour of running prolongs one\u2019s life by 7 hours [14]. If exercise protects against severe COVID-19 too, then this would be the cherry on the cake. The advice \u201crun, Forrest, run!\u201d saved the handicapped Forrest Gump from nasty bullies, cured his physical disability and paved the way for a new healthy lifestyle. In this time of widespread COVID-19-induced anxiety and sense-of-helplessness, advising people to exercise regularly will likewise accomplish more than preventing severe COVID-19. At a macro level, a number of authors have concluded that the current COVID-19 pandemic was ultimately caused by excessive human consumption that has resulted in extensive habitat destruction and spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into humans [19, 20, 21]. This is mirrored at a micro level by an imbalance between excessive consumption, large ecological footprints and insufficient exercise [20, 22]. This imbalance extends to the marked contemporary inequalities in wealth and opportunities between individuals and populations [22, 23]. These insights suggest that dealing with the current pandemic and preventing future pandemics and other health disasters will ultimately require rebalancing each of these levels [20, 21, 23]. Each of us could start this process by donning our running shoes more regularly.",
