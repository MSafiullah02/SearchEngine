If so, the decreases in LNCa caused by SLA are compensated for, and an \u2018apparent\u2019 correlation between RGR and SLA may be established. From Eqn 4, the negative effect of SLA can be compensated if LNP or \u2018a\u2019 negatively, or SAR positively, correlates with SLA. However, LNP may generally positively correlate with SLA (Wright & Westoby, 2000), and nitrogen allocation between organs may not be systematically different between species (Osone & Tateno, 2005b). Thus, the most likely candidate appears to be SAR. In fact, Osone & Tateno (2005b) demonstrated, by means of a comparative experiment and a physiologically controlled experiment, that SAR positively affects leaf : root ratio, leaf nitrogen, and maximum photosynthesis rate. Furthermore, limited studies showed that SLA correlates positively with SAR across species, and the close associations between SAR and RGR reported in these studies also suggest a strong involvement of SAR in determining RGR (Poorter & Remkes, 1990; Garnier, 1991; Poorter et al., 1991; Reich et al., 1998b; Wright & Westoby, 2000). However, how SAR interacts with each of these leaf parameters and how much SAR contributes to RGR remain poorly understood.",

We hypothesized that SAR is positively associated with SLA across species, and that SAR offsets the negative effects of SLA on LNCa, and thereby allows a positive correlation between SLA and RGR. If these hypotheses are true, however, it is difficult to quantify the gross positive effects of SAR and gross negative effects of SLA on LNCa from the observed pattern of LNCa, because the observed patterns only represent the outcome after these effects of SAR and SLA have been offset. To estimate these opposing effects on LNCa, we performed simulations based on the balanced growth hypothesis. We also investigated whether these hypotheses could apply to other datasets in the literature.",

The tree species, which tend to grow slowly, were germinated in advance of the herbs in order to reduce the variation in initial seedling mass between the two groups. Seeds of all tree species except Salix spp. and Z. serrata were germinated on moist vermiculite or moist filter paper, and the seedlings with two leaves were transplanted individually into 1.6 l polyethylene pots filled with washed river sand. The collected Z. serrata seedlings were first transplanted onto moist vermiculite for 1 wk to allow the roots to recover from any damage or injury sustained at the time of collection and then transplanted individually into pots. Seeds of the herb species and Salix spp. were germinated directly in polyethylene pots filled with washed river sand then the seedlings were thinned to only one per pot. After transplanting, the plants were supplied with a nutrient solution consisting of 10 mm NH4NO3, 3 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 3 mm CaCl2, 25 \u00b5m H3BO3, 2 \u00b5m MnSO4\u00b75H2O, 2 \u00b5m ZnSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.5 \u00b5m CuSO4\u00b75H2O, 0.5 \u00b5m Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O, and 20 \u00b5m Fe\u2010EDTA (pH adjusted to 6.0 with 1 m HCl). Nutrient solution was given to allow the species to absorb nitrogen at their potential rates through the entire experimental period. Since the maximum nitrogen absorption rate reported in an earlier study was 0.1 g N g\u22121 d\u22121 for a herb species (Poorter et al., 1991), the nitrogen content of the pots was maintained well above a concentration that allowed absorption at this maximum. In the early stages of the experiments, each plant was given 500 ml of nutrient solution once a day, then later, when the plants were larger, twice a day to avoid nutrient depletion. Every 2 d, the pots were flushed with tap water to avoid salt accumulation.",

Before Path analysis, all data were ln\u2010transformed. Based on the balanced growth hypothesis, our path model assumed that SLA, LNP, leaf : root ratio and SAR affect LNCa, and that the leaf : root ratio adjusts the balance between carbon inflow (SLA and LNP) and nitrogen inflow (SAR). The relationships between LNP, SLA, and SAR were set as covariations, that is, with no direct effects between these variables. However, it is conceivable that SLA, in part, directly affects LNP, since it is mostly determined by lamina thickness and the density of the leaf tissues, which affect the net photosynthetic rate per unit leaf nitrogen by influencing the degree of attenuation of photons passing through and the rate of CO2 diffusion in the leaves (Hikosaka, et al., 1998; Poorter & Evans, 1998). However, anatomical factors are not the only factors affecting photosynthetic nitrogen\u2010use efficiency. Hikosaka et al. (1998) showed that differ\u2010ences in allocation of nitrogen to ribulose\u20101,5\u2010bisphosphate carboxylase, a key enzyme of photosynthesis, and specific activity of ribulose\u20101,5\u2010bisphosphate carboxylase also affect photosynthetic nitrogen\u2010use efficiency. Thus, we assumed that SLA and LNP would covary with each other so as to follow the \u2018plant trait syndrome\u2019, that is, multiple plant traits having evolved in a coordinated manner showing a specific combination between species (Reich et al., 1992; Grime, 2001).",

Although the trend was not statistically significant, this may to some extent compensate for the negative effect of SLA. To estimate how much of an effect this might have, we calculated species LNCa values using Eqn 4, assigning measured species values to SLA and the leaf : root ratio, while fixing other parameters with the values obtained from Z. serrata between species (simulation 2). LNCa values calculated in this simulation (Fig. 2a, open circles) were generally larger than those in simulation 1, but still smaller than the measured LNCa values. This suggests that the leaf : root ratio partly compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNCa, but there should be factors also affecting LNCa positively. LNP increased with SLA (Fig. 3b). Since an increase in LNP negatively affects LNCa (Eqn 4), this should not compensate for the negative effect of SLA. In a similar manner to simulation 2, the coupled effects of SLA and LNP on LNCa values were calculated assigning measured species values to SLA and LNP in Eqn 4 while fixing other parameters (simulation 3). The calculated LNCa values showed only a slight decrease compared with simulation 1 (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the negative effect of LNP was small, even though LNP showed the same degree of variation as SLA (Fig. 1a,c). The coefficient of the relationship between mass\u2010based leaf nitrogen concentration and plant nitrogen concentration, a, was almost constant across species (Fig. 3c), and therefore had little effect on LNCa (Fig. 2c, simulation 4). Finally, SAR showed a large increase with SLA (Fig. 3d). LNCa values calculated using Eqn 4 by assigning observed values to SLA and SAR with all other parameters kept constant across species were much larger than those in simulation 1 and close to the measured LNCa values (Fig. 2d, simulation 5). This suggests that the negative effect of SLA on LNCa was largely compensated for by SAR.",

Because of the smaller LNCa of species with a larger SLA, the calculated RGR increased only marginally with increases in SLA (Fig. 4a). Although LNP by itself had a less negative effect on LNCa (Fig. 2b), the slope of RGR on LNP was also reduced because of the correlation with SLA (Fig. 4b).

Across all species, LNCa showed no significant relationship with SAR but instead showed convergence. However, within the five species with similar SLA (SLA between 30 and 36 m2 kg\u22121, closed circles), LNCa showed a strong positive relationship with SAR (r2 = 0.89, P = 0.001). As the variation in SLA was small among these species, this increase in LNCa represents the positive effects of SAR on LNCa, excluding the effects of SLA. On the other hand, a between\u2010group comparison showed the effects of SLA on LNCa excluding the effects of SAR. At the same SAR, species with smaller SLA (open squares) generally showed a larger LNCa than the five species described (located above the regression line of the five species), while those with larger SLA (open circles) showed a smaller LNCa (located below the regression line of the five species), indicating that SLA negatively affected LNCa. The apparent convergence of LNCa when all species were included was thus a result of these opposing effects of SLA and SAR counteracting each other. Similar patterns were observed for the leaf : root ratio when grouping species by SLA (Fig. 5b); at a similar SAR, the leaf : root ratio was smaller in larger SLA species, while at a similar SLA, it was larger in larger\u2010SAR species. This suggests that the leaf : root ratio was also affected by SLA and SAR in a coordinated manner.",

Note that the parameters were plotted against SAR so as to contrast parameters that affect LNCa negatively on the y\u2010axis with SAR, which affects LNCa positively, on the x\u2010axis. As in the present study, SLA and LNP were strongly correlated with SAR in these earlier studies (Fig. 6a,b), although LNP showed distinct between\u2010study differences. The leaf : root ratio increased with SAR slightly in Poorter's dataset, but showed no consistent relationship in Reich's dataset (Fig. 6c). In Poorter's study, LNCa decreased with SAR only slightly, suggesting that the negative effect on LNCa was largely compensated for by SAR, as in the present study (Fig. 6d). On the other hand, in Reich's study, LNCa decreased with SAR more greatly. At first glance, this was different from the present result, but in fact did not contradict the balanced growth hypothesis. In Reich's dataset, slopes of SLA and LNP on SAR were larger than those in the present study and Poorter's study, indicating that the negative effects of SLA and LNP on LNCa were more dominant over the positive effects of SAR on LNCa than in these other studies. Therefore, if the balanced growth hypothesis is true, LNCa should decrease more steeply than the other datasets. Equation 4 showed that in Reich's dataset, where 3.6\u2010 and 3.4\u2010fold variations in SLA and LNP were associated with a 7.6\u2010fold variation in SAR, compensation of the negative effects of SLA and LNP by SAR should be 40% (LNCa should decrease by 60% with increasing SAR). This is almost in accordance with the observed 64% decrease in LNCa in the dataset, suggesting that the behavior of LNCa followed the balanced growth hypothesis. As a result of the combined behaviors of LNCa and LNP on SAR, NAR increased with SAR in the present and Reich's study and showed no consistent pattern with SAR in Poorter's study (Fig. 6e).",

According to the balanced growth hypothesis (Eqn 4), to fully compensate for the negative effect of SLA (which varied 1.9\u2010fold between species) on LNCa, SAR or leaf : root ratio should vary at least 3.6 (=1.92)\u2010fold, being positively correlated with SLA, or a or LNP should vary 3.6\u2010 fold, being negatively correlated with SLA. In the present study, 3.9\u2010fold variation in SAR was associated with SLA, which was just enough to compensate for the negative effect of SLA resulting in a minimal decrease in LNCa with increasing SLA (Fig. 2). Negative relationships between SLA and LNCa (or NAR) were previously indicated in earlier studies (Poorter & Remkes, 1990; Biere, 1996; McKenna & Shipley, 1999; Wright & Westoby, 2000; Shipley, 2002).

Given that a larger SLA increases carbon inflow and a larger SAR increases nitrogen inflow to plants, these responses are analogous to the phenotypic response of the leaf : root ratio to changes in the external environment. In general, plants increase their leaf : root ratio in response to factors that increase nitrogen inflow relative to carbon inflow such as increased soil nitrogen availability, and decrease the ratio in response to factors that decrease nitrogen inflow relative to carbon inflow, such as increased light intensity (Kachi & Rorison, 1989; Olff, 1992; Poorter, 1999; Osone & Tateno, 2005a). These phenotypic responses are adaptive, allowing plants to compensate for relatively growth\u2010limiting resources and maintain high growth rates under a wide range of environmental conditions (\u00c5gren & Ingestad, 1987; Hirose, 1987; Kachi & Rorison, 1989; Ishizaki et al., 2003; Osone & Tateno, 2005a). Similar to this phenotypic response, a plant species with a specific combination of SLA and SAR may adjust its biomass allocation to increase either the carbon or nitrogen inflow, depending on which is more growth\u2010limiting for the species. However, these trends were masked when all species were included in the comparisons, because the covariation of SLA and SAR caused counteraction of these confronting effects (Fig. 5b). This might be why the leaf : root ratio or LMR generally does not show a consistent pattern between species in comparative growth analysis (reviewed by Aerts & Chapin, 2000; Poorter & Nagel, 2000).",

This may give the impression that having larger SLA is of little advantage in increasing RGR. However, in fact, our calculations may have overestimated the negative effects of SLA and LNP on LNCa and LMR because we did not consider a functional relationship between LNCa and LNP. Since NAR is generally a curvilinear function of LNCa, with the x\u2010intercept larger than zero (Hirose, 1986; Van der Werf et al., 1993; Osone & Tateno, 2005a,b), LNP is maximized at LNCa when the tangent from the origin touches the NAR\u2013LNCa curve, and is decreased with LNCa moving away from the point. If this relationship were included, the decreases in LNCa of larger SLA species would be less than what was actually calculated, because the concomitant decreases in LNP should alleviate further decreases in LNCa (see Eqn 4).",

The correlation between SAR and specific root length (root length per root mass) was reported in Reich et al. (1998b) and Osone & Tateno (2005b). On the other hand, Reich et al. (1998b) showed there were also substantial differences in area\u2010based nitrogen absorption rate (nitrogen absorbed per root surface area per unit time), suggesting an involvement of root physiology to species differences in SAR. In the present study, SRL varied approx. fivefold between species and positively related with SAR (r\n2 = 0.41, unpublished data), but the area\u2010based nitrogen absorption rate differed only 1.5\u2010fold between species. Thus, species differences in SAR may be largely caused by species differences in root morphology in the present study.",

Consistent with the present study, the negative effects of SLA and LNP on LNCa were largely compensated for by SAR in Poorter's dataset (Fig. 6d). However, in Reich's study, the negative effects were only compensated for by 36% (a 64% decrease in LNCa, Fig. 6d). This lower degree of compensation might be caused by differences in the experimental conditions. In Reich's study, plants were given nutrient solution with a nitrogen concentration almost half that of the present study once a day, compared with twice a day in the present study. Therefore, species with higher carbon gain (i.e. higher SLA and LNP) might experience nitrogen depletion as they grow and absorb nitrogen at a lower rate than their potential, while other species might absorb nitrogen near their potential. This should result in a relatively small SAR to SLA (a steep SLA\u2013SAR slope), and thus a decreased LNCa in larger SLA species. From these results, we tentatively conclude that the covariation of SAR with SLA and LNP is a general trend, but that the degree of compensation by SAR may differ between datasets or experimental conditions. To generalize what experimental conditions causes partial or full compensation requires further studies.",

This might be because of the difference in light conditions. In the present study, where plants were grown in a naturally illuminated growth chamber, they gradually closed their stomata from early afternoon when the light intensity was maximized (1700 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121) and accordingly the photosynthetic rate decreased. On the other hand, in Poorter's study, where plants were grown under a constant weaker photon flux density of 315 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121 under 14\u2010h\u2010day period, plants were possibly able to photosynthesize at a constant rate during the daytime. This might have caused a larger daily assimilation (NAR), and thus LNP, in Poorter's study than in the present study (Fig. 6b,e), although the average light intensity during the daytime was lower in the former. When carbon inflow is limiting, plants generally increase leaf : root ratio to compensate for the small carbon inflow (Hirose, 1987; Hilbert et al., 1991). Thus, the larger leaf : root ratio in the present study might be a response to the smaller daily assimilation (Fig. 6c). It is notable, however, that the LNCa\u2013SAR relationships were still conservative between the two studies (Fig. 6d), despite the large difference in LNP. These results suggest that the leaf and root physiological properties and biomass allocation are strictly coordinated between species.",

A possible explanation for the inconsistency is the differences in ambient light adopted in different studies (Poorter, 1999; Ryser & Wahl, 2001; Shipley, 2002, 2006; see also Medek et al., 2007). In an experiment where plants experience a weak ambient light at which photosynthesis is not light\u2010saturated, the species difference in NAR is small, and thus SLA remains the main determinant of RGR. Conversely, in an experiment where higher ambient light is adopted, species differences in NAR are highlighted, and thus NAR will become the main determinant of RGR. Shipley (2006) provided strong support for this contention by meta\u2010analysis, but also pointed out that substantial inconsistencies between studies still remain that cannot be accounted for by differences in light conditions.",

            "text": "The present study may provide a supplementary explanation for this issue. From our hypotheses, the pattern of species LNCa in a dataset depends on the net effects of parameters that affect LNCa both positively (SAR) and negatively (SLA, LNP). Therefore, theoretically, LNCa could either decrease or increase independently with LNP between species. Since NAR is a product of LNCa and LNP, these inconsistent behaviors of LNCa and LNP may interfere with a consistent pattern of NAR between studies. In a dataset where LNCa and LNP are negatively related, a positive relationship between LNP and RGR is always offset to a certain extent by the negative relationship between LNCa and RGR. In this case, the extent of the relationship between RGR and NAR will be determined by the relative strength of the relationships between LNP and RGR, and between LNCa and RGR in the dataset. The datasets of Poorter and Reich in Fig. 6 provide good examples of this. In the two datasets, the relationships between SAR and other parameters presented in Fig. 6 can be equated by the relationships between RGR and the parameters, since SAR was strongly related to RGR (P < 0.001). In Reich's study, LNP increased and LNCa decreased with SAR (and thus RGR), and LNP showed a much steeper increase with SAR than the decrease in LNCa with SAR (Figs 6b,d). Consequently, NAR, the product of LNP and LNCa, showed a positive relationship with SAR (and thus RGR) (Fig. 6e). In Poorter's dataset, LNP and LNCa also showed inverse trends with SAR, but the increase in LNP balanced the decrease in LNCa (Fig. 6b,d). As a result, NAR was almost constant with SAR (and thus RGR) (Fig. 6e). In a dataset in which LNCa does not show a distinct converse trend with LNP, without such countervailing effects between LNCa and LNP, a positive relationship between NAR and RGR might exist. An example of this is provided by the present study. In the present study, LNCa was almost constant to RGR (Fig. 1d), while LNP increased with RGR (Fig. 1c), which results in NAR being positively related to RGR (Fig. 1b). Similarly, Wright & Westoby (2000) suggested that the negative correlation between LNP and LNCa and the different degrees of correlation between studies could cause the lack of a general pattern in the RGR\u2013NAR relationship between studies.",
