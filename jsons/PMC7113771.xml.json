TCoV infection causes significant economic losses in turkey industry due to uneven growth and poor feed conversion. The turkey coronaviral enteritis was the most costly disease of turkeys in Minnesota in the early 1960s (Panigrahy et al., 1973). Outbreaks of a similar enteric disease in turkey poults occurred in Indiana and North Carolina in the early and middle 1990s and remains as a threat to the turkey industry.",

The only known post-translational modification of coronavirus N proteins is phosphorylation (Garwes et al., 1984). The coronavirus N protein is immunodominant (Ignjatovic and McWaters, 1991). Carboxyl-terminal 119 amino acids of nucleocapsid protein of IBV expressed by Fowlpox Virus has been shown to induce cross-protective immunity against infections among different IBV strains (Yu et al., 2001). The N proteins from various RNA viruses, such as mumps, rabies, measles, and IBV have been used as coating antigens in antibody-capture ELISA for the diagnosis of infections (Reid-sanden et al., 1990, Hummel et al., 1992, Ndifuna et al., 1998). Subcloning of the N gene to a prokaryotic expression system has resulted in a high-level induction of recombinant protein in our laboratory (Loa et al., 2004). The recombinant TCoV N protein expressed from the prokaryotic system is expected to maintain its antigenic integrity because it is not glycosylated. The purpose of the present study was to develop a recombinant TCoV N protein-based ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV in turkey sera.",

In comparison, the recombinant TCoV N protein expressed from the prokaryotic system could be purified to be a homogenous preparation containing only a single protein as shown in the present study. Although a protein band below 50 kDa with reactivity to a TCoV antiserum was noted in the inclusion body and flow through solutions. The protein was likely a degradation product of the recombinant N protein through dissolution and extraction steps of inclusion body pellets. Expression of two different forms (52 and 43 kDa) of TCoV N protein was observed in previous publications (Guy et al., 2002; Gomaa et al., 2008). The protein size as noted in the present study is approximately in the range of smaller form of those previous observations.

The results from the present study indicated that ELISA using recombinant TCoV N protein as coating antigen is more sensitive than that using IBV antigen and requires less amount of conjugate antibody in the reaction. Consequently, the cost of ELISA using recombinant TCoV N protein for every sample to be tested is reduced. The optimum dilution of testing serum samples at 1:800 indicated that the established ELISA is convenient to use and only requires a very small amount of serum for testing. Theoretically, 0.25 \u03bcl of serum sample is enough for testing in duplicate wells in the ELISA. In addition, in order to alleviate variation in the preparation of serum dilutions, 2-step sequential dilutions at 1:100 and 1:8 were performed for the serum samples in the present study.",

The relative sensitivity seemed lower in the present study than that from different studies and different laboratories.

The relative sensitivity (86.0%) of the established ELISA in the present study is comparable to that (92.9 or 93.1%) from the other 2 studies. However, such slight variation might be due to different pools of serum samples in different studies.

In contrast, the serum samples negative for TCoV by IFA from the fields got higher readings and variations in ELISA. Therefore, the cut-off point based on evaluation of ELISA performance with those two experimental groups tends to be lower. The cut-off value as OD reading was at 0.18 in that report.
