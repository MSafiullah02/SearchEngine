When used in premature and low birth weight infants in resource-limited countries, KMC has been shown to reduce infant mortality, improve thermoregulation, reduce nosocomial infection, increase rates of breastfeeding and reduce length of hospital stay [1, 3]. In developed countries, SSC between infants and their parents has been shown to have additional health and psychosocial benefits. Studies have shown that SSC is an effective intervention to reduce autonomic responses to painful stimuli such as heel sticks and venipunctures [4\u20138]. One study demonstrated a reduction in serum and salivary cortisol after a heel stick in infants receiving SSC versus those undergoing the procedure in an incubator [9]. Additional reported infant benefits include improved cardiorespiratory stability, evidence of energy conservation with lower heart rate and activity levels, improved sleep organization and quality, and improved infant emotional regulation [10\u201316]. Reported parental benefits include improved mother-infant bonding, increased maternal and paternal confidence and satisfaction in the care of their infant, reduced stress and anxiety, and improved maternal emotional healing after the stress of a preterm delivery [11, 13, 17\u201322].",

Obstacles encountered by parents can include fear and anxiety surrounding holding their infant, concern regarding the clinical stability of their infant, maternal medical conditions, and insufficient time or resources [23\u201325]. Additional barriers encountered by clinicians include a desire to adhere to traditional newborn care practices, ambivalent attitudes toward skin-to-skin care, lack of recognition of the value of parental holding, difficulty achieving parental buy-in, concerns regarding adverse events due to clinical instability, lack of training, and lack of time and resources to facilitate parental holding [23\u201327]. Quality improvement efforts aimed at addressing these common barriers have been shown to be successful in improving utilization of parental SSC with their newborns in the NICU [28\u201331].",

Results suggest additional benefits compared with later-onset KMC including further decreases in infant mortality, decreased weight loss in the first 48 h after birth, and increased exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months of age [32\u201334]. In developed nations, a Cochrane review found that early SSC between mothers and healthy newborn infants had a positive effect on breastfeeding at 1\u20134 months post delivery and blood glucose levels 75\u201390 min after birth [35]. The effects of initiating early parental SSC for ill infants or extremely preterm infants in developed nations are not well described. A study in Sweden found that the median time to first SSC between parents and extremely preterm infants in seven regional level 3 hospitals in Sweden was six postnatal days. Factors increasing time to first parental hold included lower gestational age, higher severity of clinical illness, and increased ventilator days [36].",

Under the guidance of instructors of a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt course, our team performed a current state assessment and reviewed baseline data over a 6 month period from 1/2013 to 6/2013 that included time to first parental hold, adverse events that occurred during first parental hold, and number and type of invasive lines and respiratory support present during first parental hold. After reviewing the baseline data, our group developed our project aim statements as described above. We created a baseline process map depicting the steps necessary to achieve first parental hold to help our group better understand our unit\u2019s current process for parental holding and identify areas for improvement (Fig. 1). In addition, we conducted a parental survey to assess their expectations regarding holding their infant. We found a bimodal distribution for parental comfort of holding their infant with 45% of parents being either somewhat or very uncomfortable holding their infant and 45% of parents being either somewhat or very comfortable holding their infant. In contrast, when asked about their expectations regarding holding their infant, we found that 90% of parents either somewhat or very strongly agreed that they should hold their infant within the first 24 h after birth. Even though some parents expressed concerns regarding their comfort level with holding their infant, the majority of parents expressed interest in early parental holding.",

Fifty-five providers responded to our survey, and the results were used to create a Pareto chart (Fig. 3).

Balancing measures included adverse events during first parental hold, respiratory support present during first parental hold, and number and type of invasive lines present during first parental hold. Adverse events during parental hold were defined as accidental extubation, dislodgement of a central line (including umbilical lines, peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC] lines, peripheral arterial lines), cardiorespiratory instability (significant bradycardia or desaturations), and hypothermia at the conclusion of the parental hold (temperature < 36 \u00b0C).",

More babies in the pre-intervention group had a PICC line present during first parental hold compared with the postintervention group, which we believe is secondary to the overall older age of these babies at the time of first hold. There was only one adverse event during our intervention period associated with first parental hold which was an unplanned extubation of an infant on high frequency oscillatory ventilation, compared with two adverse noted during baseline data collection (one episode of apnea and bradycardia requiring termination of parental hold and one episode of bloody secretions in the infant\u2019s endotracheal tube).",

Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of parental SSC in extremely preterm infants born at 22\u201326 weeks\u2019 gestation, infants requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and infants with other medical equipment such as umbilical catheters and nasogastric tubes [22, 37\u201345]. The results of our quality improvement initiative are in agreement with these findings as our study was able to improve the time to first parental hold without an increase in adverse events. Creation of specific unit policies for parental SSC can facilitate safe and effective parental holding in the NICU. Close assessment of infant tolerance of SSC, monitoring of vital signs for physiologic stability, and standardized parental education for safe transfer of the infant between the incubator or crib and the parents\u2019 chest are of utmost importance. Formal unit policies regarding SSC can reduce variation in the information parents are given regarding timing and appropriateness of SSC, reducing miscommunication, and parental confusion. Additional guidelines to assist with development of unit SSC and KMC policies are published in the literature [38, 46\u201349].",

In general, parents have been able to overcome their fear of holding sick infants with encouragement and education from staff. Our most important key to success was the creation of a multidisciplinary team involving different types of providers, including frontline staff of nursing, respiratory therapy and PT/OT who were responsible for ensuring the success of our interventions by increasing parental comfort with holding their infant. Our group identified several barriers to achieving parental holding within the first 24 h after birth, including degree of maternal illness that may impact ability to visit the NICU, lack of standardization of practice surrounding parental holding in the delivery room, and other ongoing NICU initiatives such as midline head positioning for VLBW infants for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) reduction. Next steps for our team will include increasing early holding by encouraging mothers to perform brief skin-to-skin in the delivery room immediately after birth, staff education regarding techniques for parental holding while maintaining the head in a midline position for VLBW infants, inclusion of a parent representative as a member of our quality improvement team, and implementation of video education on an iPad for parents demonstrating direct parental transfer of an infant from the bed to the parent\u2019s chest.",

However, there was no significant change in the rates of IVH (both total and severe IVH) in our unit during our study timeframe (2013\u20132015) based on review of Vermont Oxford Network data for our NICU. It is unclear if our results will be generalizable to other NICUs with differing patient populations such as infants requiring more complex surgical interventions or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Our results were not stratified based on gestational age, and different strategies may be needed to improve rates of parental holding in ill term versus preterm infants. In addition, there is a large gap between our baseline data and postimplementation data collection periods secondary to constraints of the Lean Six Sigma course that guided our improvement team. It is possible that our NICU staff\u2019s behaviors and attitudes toward parental SSC began to change as a result of the formation of our improvement team and prior to initiation of our improvement bundle, especially given the long duration of baseline data analysis and planning prior to implementation of our interventions.
