In the first class, an active individual can contact all of its neighbors at the same time. Here, the outbreak threshold can vanish, regardless of the direction of propagation. In the case where active individuals are senders (Model 1a), the epidemic prevalence is larger than in the case where they are receivers (Model 1b). This is due to the fact that in Model 1b, propagation from more than one infected neighbors comes to nothing. In the second class, an active individual can contact only one neighbor. In contrast to the first class, when the active individuals are receivers (Model 2b), the epidemic prevalence is larger than that for Model 2a. This result may look counterintuitive at first sight; however, this result is not so surprising, because for Model 2b, an infected hub can transmit disease to more than one individual during a time step, in contrast to Model 2a. It is more surprising that in the case where the transmission is bidirectional (Model 2c), the outbreak threshold can vanish, while in the case the transmission is one way (Models 2a and 2b), the threshold remains finite. Thus, in the second class, the bidirectional transmission causes a qualitatively different effect. The intuitive explanation is that in Model 2c, a hub can play double role: a strong sender and strong receiver, as in models of the first class. However, it is emphasized that these are different types of phase transitions:  in Model 2c, while  in first class.",

Thus, it is a matter there are more than a few works where it is not clear what mechanism is adapted. As the six models handle extreme situations, more complicated models have to considered to reproduce the practical situations. However, the result of this paper has a wide-range of applications in the study of the spreading phenomena, not only for epidemic diseases but also for such things as rumors and information. For example, in the case that an active individual receives information from one neighbor and sends it to another neighbor, rather than all neighbors, Model 2c indicates that the information can survive even if the transmission rate is very low. In real world networks, the links can be rewired adaptively depending on the state of their nodes. This paper is also expected to be a reference point when considering such adaptive networks.",
