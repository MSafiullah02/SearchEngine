Origins researchers often try to pin down functional or material aspects of life that they believe must have been present and conserved from the outset. So important are such characteristics that without them, life no longer deserves to be called life (according to such an approach). One example is the so-called \u201cchemistry conservation principle\u201d as invoked by [3]. Their argument is summarized thus: \u201cThe chemical traits of organisms are more conservative than the changing environment and hence retain information about ancient environmental conditions\u201d [4]. Under this principle, a search for the context of life\u2019s origins is essentially a search for prebiotic environments that match cellular conditions as closely as possible.",

This leads to the various \u201cX-first\u201d theories for the emergence of life. For instance, in the so-called \u201cstrong RNA-first\u201d theory, \u201cDarwinian evolution is thought to be necessary for nonintelligent matter to self-organize to produce behaviors that we ascribe to biology\u201d [5], and the onset of Darwinism would occur with the abiotic formation of long-chained RNA polymers. Conversely, in many \u201cmetabolism-first\u201d theories, life is viewed \u201clike other self-organizing systems in the Universe, as an inevitable outcome of particular disequilibria\u201d [6]. In this view, life, first and foremost, serves to dissipate these specific disequilibria, using disequilibria conversion engines to maintain its own low-entropy state [7,8]. Furthermore, in \u201ccompartment-first\u201d theories, \u201ccompartmentalization of primitive biochemical reactions within membrane-bound water micro-droplets is considered an essential step in the origin of life\u201d [9]. This spatial organization and molecular crowding is often mediated by self-assembling lipid vesicles, conferring heightened functionalilty to other biomolecules [10,11].",

Yet another question asks how we might create, in a completely synthetic fashion, new structures that we would deem living. All origins-of-life questions\u2014be it to explain the origin of chemiosmotic coupling in earthly life, the circumvention of the \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d in any template-driven replicating system, or the creation of dynamical order in general\u2014are valid, but they are not necessarily asking the same thing.",

One might argue that at the instant a fluctuation occurs, there is a momentary creation of free energy. However, harnessing such a fluctuation would require measurement and information-processing, and, as [56] showed, to accomplish this in a finite memory system requires erasure, which cannot be done for free and hence there is in fact no free energy created by fluctuations of an equilibrium system. In general, any perturbation of such a system will disappear in finite time as the system re-relaxes, hence we allow for homeostasis in equilibrium systems (in contrast, biological homeostatic processes generally occur through the consumption of free energy).",

Amyloids (prions) are essentially peptide conformational viruses, since they propagate via a pathological spread of their own conformation on existing peptides (of different conformation) [57,58,59]. There are also autocatalytic genes, known as transposons: \u201ctransposable or mobile elements capable of parasite-like proliferation in the host genome\u201d [60,61,62,63]. If we also consider the biochemical examples of self-replicating micelles and droplets [64,65], we see that the subset of entities that are dissipative and autocatalytic potentially deserve a dedicated category of their own. We note that such a category would also include phenomena at higher levels in the hierarchy of life. For instance, Internet memes are clearly autocatalytic and dissipative (given the computational energetic costs involved in their proliferation and communication). Furthermore, the social-media-membership-plus-meme system learns collectively, placing it in region 6 of Figure 5. Furthermore, in analogy to biological viruses, misinformation stories that are only weakly correlated with reality can be amplified by various effects to the point of causing disruptive socio-political impacts.",

In our view, it is also plausible that relatively simple systems capable of rudimentary information processing can arise de novo and that the ability of these systems to optimize over time their dissipative, autocatalytic, and homeostatic traits will determine their ultimate fate (see also [66]). For instance, the first life on Earth almost certainly did not use DNA for information storage or any recognizable enzymes in its metabolic network. After innumerable tugs of war between chance and necessity, evolution produced the familiar macromolecules that we observe today. In Section 2.2, we turn to how the concept of lyfe can change our approaches to investigations of the origins of life.",

Phosphorous is a key constituent of modern biology; it is found in ATP, the universal energy currency of life, metabolic cofactors like NADH, and information storage molecules like DNA and RNA. However, ref. [81] identified a plausible phosphate-free metabolism using a systems biology approach. Within the biosphere, a phosphate-independent metabolism exists that heavily depends on iron-sulfur and transition metal enzymes\u2014which themselves have been linked to geochemical scenarios for the emergence of biochemistry [82,83,84]. Network-based algorithms suggest that various environmental parameters could result in a thioester-based proto-metabolic network similar to the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle [85]. This would result in a \u201cthioester world\u201d, which, once phosphate became bioavailable, transitioned to the modern \u201cphosphate world\u201d that features ATP and nucleotides [70].

It is a longstanding problem that RNA synthesis and polymerization is a challenge in most abiotic environments (e.g., [96,97]), although several advances have been made in this area recently (e.g., [98]). Amyloid-based replicators offer an alternative to RNA: their monomers are more readily synthesized in prebiotic scenarios; they are stable under early Earth conditions; they are self-assembling, replicative, catalytic, and may be capable of adapting to changes in their environment [57,58]. Although amyloidosis is most famously known for being associated with human diseases [99], modern life uses functional amyloidal proteins to its benefit, from biofilm formation to dehydration resistance to long-term memory [58]. Should the earliest living entities have comprised an \u201camyloid world,\u201d rather than an \u201cRNA world,\u201d this would represent a unique type of lyfe.",

Alternatively, membranes may not be required for lyfe on Titan because the extraordinarily low temperatures already prevent the dissolution of macromolecules, and membrane-like structures would inhibit the diffusion of metabolites in and out of a cold, stationary lyving system [105].

This occurs through the flagellar motor proteins, close relatives of the ATP synthases [110,111]. Flagellar motors dissipate the free energy of ATP hydrolysis in eukaryotes, or ion motive forces in prokaryotes, for the production of rotational motion. Rotation of the central rotor causes the flagellar filament to spin, and the structure of the filament allows the rotational motion to produce translational movement of the organism in water (this motion has been compared to the mechanism by which corks are thrust from a bottle by the rotation of a corkscrew [112]).",

Due to the many major transitions in train development, it would be a challenge to examine a modern-day Shinkansen and deduce in a \u201ctop-down\u201d manner the components of the first train. While the materials that trains are built from have changed over time, their purpose and functions have remained constant. By analogy, the biological components that life uses today may be different from the biological components at life\u2019s emergence, but the processes\u2014the four pillars of lyfe\u2014have been conserved.
