There is no definitive list of all possible sources of these system vulnerabilities. Many scholars and indeed many security incident reporting agencies, such as Bugtraq, the mailing list for vulnerabilities; CERT/CC, the US Computer Emergency Response Team; NTBugtraq, the mailing list for Windows security; RUS-CERT, the German Computer Emergency Response Team; and US DOE-CIAC, the US Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability, have called attention to not only one but multiple factors that contribute to these security problems and pose obstacles to the security solutions. Among the most frequently mentioned sources of security vulnerability problems in computer networks are design flaws, poor security management, incorrect implementation, Internet technology vulnerability, the nature of intruder activity, the difficulty of fixing vulnerable systems, the limits of effectiveness of reactive solutions, and social engineering [2] .",

Overconfidence and use of nonstandard or untested algorithms: Before algorithms are fully tested by peers, they are put into the product line because they seem to have worked on a few test runs. 4. Malice: Software developers, like any other professionals, have malicious people in their ranks. Bugs, viruses, and worms have been known to be embedded and downloaded in software, as is the case with Trojan horse software, which boots itself at a timed location. As we will see in Sect. 8.4, malice has traditionally been used for vendetta, personal gain (especially monetary), and just irresponsible amusement. Although it is possible to safeguard against other types of human errors, it is very difficult to prevent malice. 5. Complacency: When either an individual or a software producer has significant experience in software development, it is easy to overlook certain testing and other error control measures in those parts of software that were tested previously in a similar or related product, forgetting that no one software product can conform to all requirements in all environments.",

Difficult testing: There will never be a complete set of test programs to check software exhaustively for all bugs for a given input sequence. 3. Ease of programming: The fact that software programming is easy to learn encourages many people with little formal training and education in the field to start developing programs, but many are not knowledgeable about good programming practices or able to check for errors. 4.

Most importantly, we do not care about the quality of that software, the honesty of the anonymous programmer, and of course its reliability as long as it does what we want it to do. Even if we want to trace the authorship of the software product, it is impossible because software companies are closed within months of their opening. Chances are when a software product is 2 years old, its producer is likely to be out of business.

For example, ordinary addition of a software or even an addition or removal of an argument to an existing software module may cause an imbalanced interface.

In a broader framework, when the turnaround time is very short, system security experts who develop patches do not have enough time to reverse engineer and analyze the attack in order to produce counter immunization codes. It has been and it is still the case in many security incidents for antivirus companies to take hours and sometime days, such as in the case of the Code Red virus, to come up with an effective cure.

This is the most classic approach, in which hackers call up a targeted individual in a position of authority or relevance and initiate a conversation with the goal of gradually pulling information out of the target. This is done mostly to help desks and main telephone switch boards. Caller ID cannot help because hackers can bypass it through tricks and the target truly believes that the hacker is actually calling from inside the corporation. \u2022 Online. Hackers are harvesting a boom of vital information online from careless users. The reliance on and excessive use of the Internet have resulted in people having several online accounts. Currently an average user has about four to five accounts including one for home use, one for work, and an additional one or two for social or professional organizations. With many accounts, as probably any reader may concur, one is bound to forget some passwords, especially the least used ones. To overcome this problem, users mistakenly use one password on several accounts. Hackers know this, and they regularly target these individuals with clever baits such as telling them they won lotteries or were finalists in sweepstakes where computers select winners or they have won a specific number of prizes in a lotto, where they were computer selected. However, in order to get the award, the user must fill in an online form, usually Web-based, and this transmits the password to the hacker. Hackers have used hundreds of tricks on unsuspecting users in order for them to surrender their passwords. \u2022 Dumpster diving is now a growing technique of information theft not only in social engineering but more so in identity theft. The technique, also known as trashing, involves an information thief scavenging through individual and company dumpsters for information. Large and critical information can be dug out of dumpsters and trash cans. Dumpster diving can recover from dumpsters and trash cans individual social security numbers, bank accounts, individual vital records, and a whole list of personal and work-related information that gives the hackers the exact keys they need to unlock the network. \u2022 In person is the oldest of the information-stealing techniques that predates computers. It involves a person physically walking into an organization's offices and casually checking out note boards, trash diving into bathroom trash cans and company hallway dumpsters, and eating lunches together and initiating conversations with employees. In big companies, this can be done only on a few occasions before trusted friendships develop. From such friendships, information can be passed unconsciously. \u2022 Snail mail is done in several ways and is not limited only to social engineering but has also been used in identity theft and a number of other crimes. It has been in the news recently because of identity theft. It is done in two ways: the hacker picks a victim and goes to the Post Office and puts in a change of address form to a new box number. This gives the hacker a way to intercept all snail mail of the victim. From the intercepted mail, the hacker can gather a great deal of information that may include the victim's bank and credit card account numbers and access control codes and pins by claiming to have forgotten his or her password or pin and requesting a reissue in the mail. In another form, the hacker drops a bogus survey in the victim's mailbox offering baits of cash award for completing a \"few simple\" questions and mailing them in. The questions, in fact, request far more than simple information from an unsuspecting victim. \u2022 Impersonation is also an old trick played on unsuspecting victims by criminals for a number of goodies. These days the goodies are information. Impersonation is generally acting out a victim's character role. It involves the hacker playing a role and passing himself or herself as the victim. In the role, the thief or hacker can then get into legitimate contacts that lead to the needed information. In large organizations with hundreds or thousands of employees scattered around the globe, it is very easy to impersonate a vice president or a chief operations officer.",

This information alone goes a long way in providing additional security awareness to security experts about additional avenues whereby systems may be attacked. The reports are then encrypted and stored in secure databases accessible only with the proper user credentials. This is because these reports contain critically vital data on the security of the system and they could, therefore, be a pot of gold for hackers if found. This additional care and awareness adds security to the system.",
