The health care system should adopt a package of psychosocial interventions to reduce the anxiety of high risk groups.",

In this research, with the increase in education, the level of anxiety became higher due to the majority of female participants. A study conducted in Australia on the rate of psychological distress of the flu epidemic found that residents in areas with a higher prevalence of the illness were more likely to experience mental distress and younger and less educated groups were at greater risk of mental distress (Taylor et al., 2008) . In our study, the anxiety rate was also directly associated with a high prevalence of coronavirus infection. Although it seems that old age increases the risk of COVID-19-related infection and mortality, our findings show that anxiety level is significantly higher in 21-40 age group, which seems the main cause to be concerned is about future and economic consequences because this group is an active force in the society and they are mostly affected by unemployment, inflation, and business closures.",

First, the view of national decision makers are mainly concentrated on reducing the physical and psychological consequences of the disease ; second, there is no sufficient workforce of psychosocial professionals who has already been trained for critical situations ; third, there is a lack of coordination and cooperation among psychosocial service providers, and also the operation process is now being carried out that individuals requiring counseling services call the hotlines, while especially for those with a COVID-19 infected person, experts should reach out the target groups and provide health care interventions.",
