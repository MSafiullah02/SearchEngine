Acute respiratory tract infections almost always present with some combination of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough. Sometimes one or another of these symptoms predominates\n6\n. Because of their diverse nature, terminology has arisen based on the anatomic site of the main symptoms of the infection, i. e. rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis. It is, however, largely recognized that distinguishing between them, based on the involvement of these anatomic sites, is clinically impracticable\n7\n8\n. The term common cold encompasses multiple anatomical-clinical entities\n9\n. In English several other names are also used, e. g. acute respiratory tract infections, cold, head cold, flu (incorrectly), upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI), acute coryza, nasopharyngitis and rhinopharyngitis. Colds are associated with different symptoms such as cough, runny nose, blocked nose, sore throat, and are sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite\n10\n. Often one symptom is more dominant or more bothersome to the patient than other symptoms and the symptoms usually change over the course of the infection. The symptoms start typically with sore throat (angina) (50 % of patients\n11\n) and fatigue, progress to rhinitis with sneezing, runny nose or blocked nose and then cough (40 % of patients\n11\n). Similarly, but not identically, other authors report that usually, common cold starts with sore throat (acute pharyngitis) followed by rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and in some but not all cases acute otitis media (in children) or bronchitis with the main symptom dry cough\n12\n. It is therefore author\u2019s current position that the term common cold should be understood as an umbrella term: the first infection site usually being the pharynx, followed by coryza (rhinitis), sinusitis etc.\n",

Cough in acute bronchitis is due to irritation of receptors by release of inflammatory mediators disrupting the intact respiratory epithelium thereby sensitizing superficial cough receptors and the afferent pathway of the cough reflex. In contrast, excessive secretions play a rather ancillary role, emerging only at the very beginning of the illness\n24\n.

            "text": "\nAcute rhinitis and acute sinusitis usually coexist and are now commonly known as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) occurring in conjunction with a common cold of viral origin. Common symptoms of both the common cold and ARS are nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, rhinorrhea, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and inflamed nasal mucosa. The sudden onset of 2 or more symptoms one of which is nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip) and either facial pain or pressure or reduction or loss of smell for less than 12 weeks usually leads to the diagnosis ARS\n47\n. Only a small percentage of post-viral rhinosinusitis is caused by bacteria\n47\n. In the EPOS Guidelines\n47\nand in several presentations during the American Cough Conference 2015 in Washington, DC (will be published in Lung), however, it was suggested that a prolonged duration of ARS of up to 12 weeks is not, in itself, a sign that the condition is of bacterial origin. In addition, results of a study addressing the question of possible bidirectional modulation of cough response in human healthy volunteers showed that, in addition to trigeminal afferents expressing TRP channels, olfactory nerve endings, trigemino-olfactoric relationships, the smell perception process and other supramedullar influences should be considered as potential modulators of the cough response in humans\n46\n.\n",

It is exposed to multiple potential pathogens. Acute pharyngitis is predominantly viral in etiology, accounting for 85 % to 95 % of throat infections in adults and in children younger than 5 years; in those aged 5 to 16 years, viruses cause about 70 % of throat infections, with the other 30 % due to bacteria, mostly group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS)\n48\n. However, also in this case, the cardinal feature, sore throat, is also an early feature of the common cold. Furthermore, cough, runny nose, chills, nasal congestions, and hoarseness are further symptoms which are common in non-bacterial pharyngitis and common cold\n49\n. The symptom sore throat is most likely caused by the action of prostaglandins and bradykinin on sensory nerve endings in the airway and the sensation of pain is mediated by the cranial nerves supplying the nasopharynx and pharynx\n13\n. Likewise, acute laryngitis is considered to be an infection of the larynx that results in an inflammatory reaction and consequential symptoms and signs\n50\n. It usually presents as part of an upper respiratory tract infectious syndrome and may be caused by common cold viruses such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, adenoviruses, RSV, or parainfluenza viruses. Hoarseness, aphonia, and symptoms of rhinitis or pharyngitis may also accompany this condition.\n",
