            "text": "The spread of infectious diseases between discrete geographic regions (or cities) is a phenomenon that involves many different compartments. To control the spread of an infectious disease, one has to understand how the growth and spread of the disease affect its outbreak. There are many factors that lead to the dynamics of an infectious disease of humans. They include such human behaviors as population dislocations, living styles, sexual practices and rising international travel. In current, population dispersal by human transportation plays an important role in the spread of infectious disease around the world. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spread along the routes of international air travel and infection was carried to many places [33], [34]. Khan et al. [14] pointed out a correlation between inter-regional spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus and travelers. From these observations a number of authors have proposed epidemic models describing disease transmission dynamics among multiple locations due to the population dispersal (see [3], [4], [10], [23], [24], [25], [26], [29], [30], [31], [32] and the references therein). Recently, Cui et al. [7] have proposed a SIS epidemic model to understand the effect of transport related infection on disease spread. Takeuchi et al. [27] proved the global dynamics of model in [7]. They found that the global stabilities of equilibria disease-free and endemic equilibriums, still required additional condition besides the condition for their existence. Considering entry screening and exit screening to detect infected individuals, Liu and Takeuchi [20] proposed an SIQS model to study the effect of transport-related infection and entry screening. Subsequently, Liu and Zhou [21] analyzed global stability of an SIRS epidemic model with transport-related infection. Their results shown transport-related infection can make the disease endemic even if both the isolated regions are disease free. Obviously, the models in [7], [20], [27] assumed that a susceptible individual becomes infectious immediately after infected. However, for many diseases, a host stays in a latent period before becoming infectious after infected, Wan and Cui [29] formulated an SEIS epidemic model to describe the transmission of infectious diseases related by transports. When the individuals have immunity to the disease after recover, the SEIR or SEIRS models are more general than the SEI or SEIS types depending on whether the acquired immunity is permanent or otherwise. These kinds of models have These kinds of models have been studied to gain insights into the transmission dynamics of disease in community. For example, Greenhalgh [11] considered an SEIR model that incorporates density dependence in the death rate. Cooke and Driessche [6] introduced and analyzed the SEIRS model with two delays. Greenhalgh [12] studied Hopf bifurcations in the SEIRS type models with density dependent contact rate and death rate. Li and Muldowney [16] and Li et al. [17] studied the global dynamics of the SEIR models with a non-linear incidence rate as well as standard incidence rate. Li et al. [18] analyzed the global dynamics of the SEIR model with vertical transmission and a bilinear incidence. Recently, Zhang and Ma [36] analyzed the global dynamics of the SEIR model with saturating contact rate. However, those models have not applied to real data of outbreak to investigate the effect of transport-related infection when individuals travel among two cities.",

In the other hand, it is decreased when the susceptible individuals in city i leave to city j at the rate \u03b11 and by natural death at the rate b.

The disease is transmitted horizontally within and between cities according to standard the incidence rate (that is, the number of new cases of infection per unit time)\u03b2SiIiNi,fori=1,2,where \u03b2 is the transmission rate within a city. This population is further decreased when the individuals in city j travel to city i, and the disease is transmitted with the incidence rate\u03b3(\u03b11Sj)(\u03b11Ij)(\u03b11Sj+\u03b11Ej+\u03b11Ij+\u03b11Ri)=\u03b3\u03b11SjIjNj,forj=1,2,where \u03b3 is the transport-related transmission rate.

If initial conditions are set as Si(0)\u2a7e0, Ei(0)\u2a7e0, Ii(0)\u2a7e0 and Ri(0)\u2a7e0, it is easy to check that all solutions of (2.5) are nonnegative (that is Si(0)\u2a7e0, Ei(0)\u2a7e0, Ii(0)\u2a7e0 and Ri(0)\u2a7e0 for t>0, i=1,2) under the assumption 0\u2a7d\u03b3\u22641. Note that the last two terms in the first and fifth equations of (2.5) satisfy that\u03b11Si-\u03b3\u03b11SiIiNi\u2a7e0(i=1,2),for any Si\u2a7e0, Ei\u2a7e0, Ii\u2a7e0 and Ri\u2a7e0 when 0\u2a7d\u03b3\u22641. This is reasonable from a biological point of view, since the first term \u03b11Si represents the susceptible individuals leaving city i and the second term \u03b3\u03b11SiIiNi denotes individuals in \u03b11Si becoming infected during travel from city i to j. Hence, the difference between these two numbers should be nonnegative. It is supposed that 0\u2a7d\u03b3\u22641.",

That is, for the model (3.2), the next generation matrices F and V are given byF=0\u03b200andV=b+c0-ce+d.Using the next generation method, the local stability of disease-free equilibrium, P0, is based on whether or not \u03c1(FV-1)<1, where \u03c1 is the spectral radius. If \u03c1(FV-1)<1, then all eigenvalues of the linearized model have negative real parts, so that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable (LAS). For \u03c1(FV-1)>1, at least one of the eigenvalues of the linearization has positive real part, thus, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable in this case. Let R0=\u03c1(FV-1), it is easy to show that(3.4)R0=\u03b2ce+db+c.Consequently, using Theorem 2 of [28], the following results is established.Theorem 3.1\nThe disease-free equilibrium (DFE),\nP0\n, of the system (\n3.2\n) is locally asymptotically stable (LAS) if\nR0<1\nand unstable if\nR0>1\n.\nThe quantity R0 in (3.4) is called the basic reproduction number of infection [2]. It is generally known that if R0<1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable (and the disease will be eradicate from the community if the initial sizes of the four state variables are within the vicinity of P0). Therefore, in the event of an epidemic, the theoretical determination of conditions that can make R0 less than unity is of great public health interest.

Further, if infected individuals can travel and there is transport-related infection such that R0\u03b3>1 then the endemic steady state P\u03b3\u2217(S\u03b3\u2217,E\u03b3\u2217,I\u03b3\u2217,R\u03b3\u2217,S\u03b3\u2217,E\u03b3\u2217,I\u03b3\u2217,R\u03b3\u2217) appears in two cities to become stable. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 7, Fig. 8.",

When the two isolated cities are disease-free, transport-related infection may also have the possibility to lead to the disease becoming endemic. In addition, to see clearly the effect of transport-related infection, the relations among two reproduction number, R0 in (3.4) and R0\u03b3 in (3.12), are compared. It is found that R0\u03b3>R0 for \u03b3>0, and R0\u03b3=R0 for \u03b3=0. Since \u2202R0\u03b3\u2202\u03b3=\u03b11(b+c)(e+d)>0 for all \u03b3>0, it implies that R0\u03b3 increases with the increase of \u03b3.

For numerical simulation purposes, the transmission rate within a city, \u03b2, is set to be 0.6 and 0.95, respectively. The initial conditions are used: S1(0)=2, E1(0)=1, I1(0)=1, R1(0)=0, S2(0)=2, E2(0)=0, I2(0)=0 and R2(0)=0.

When \u03b2=0.6 and the other parameters b,c,d,e,\u03b11 given in Table 1, it is found that R0<1 and R0\u03b3<1 whenever 0<\u03b3<7/27, and R0>1 and R0\u03b3>1 whenever 7/27<\u03b3\u22641. Whereas \u03b2=0.95 then R0>1 and R0\u03b3>1 for all \u03b3>0. Thus, this experiment investigates the dynamics of disease transmission into two cases by solving model (2.5) with various values of \u03b2 and \u03b3: \u03b2=0.6,0.95 and \u03b3=0.09,0.2,1, whilst retaining the same values of the other parameters. In all computations, the initial conditions are taken to be S1(0)=2, E1(0)=2, I1(0)=2, R1(0)=2, S2(0)=1, E2(0)=1, I2(0)=1, R2(0)=1.Case 1.When R0<1 and R0\u03b3<1, the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 are chosen to be \u03b2=0.6 and \u03b3=0.09,0.2, respectively. The profiles of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered individuals, as depicted in Fig. 5, Fig. 6\n, reveal that the numerical solutions of model (2.5) converge to disease-free equilibrium, P1, whenever R0\u03b3<1 (as guaranteed by Lemma 3.2). This study suggests that the transport-related infection may not lead to the disease becoming endemic when R0<1 and R0\u03b3<1 for small \u03b3.Case 2.Taking the values of \u03b3=1, \u03b2=0.6 and \u03b3=1, \u03b2=0.95 give R0=0.72, R0\u03b3=1.8 and R0=1.14, R0\u03b3=2.22, respectively. These lead to study the dynamics of model (2.5) in the cases R0<1<R0\u03b3, and 1<R0<R0\u03b3. All experiments are guaranteed by Theorem 3.4 in the way that the number of all individuals asymptotically approach to coexistence endemic equilibrium for R0\u03b3>1, see Fig. 7, Fig. 8\n. Therefore, the results suggest that if there is transport \u2013 related infection such that R0\u03b3>1, then the disease is endemic in both two cities.\n",

Simulations are obtained by choosing the most proper parameters (base-case estimates) to SARS on 17 March 2003 to 26 April 2003 [35]:(4.19)a=3day-1,b=0.000034day-1,c=16.4day-1,d=14day-1,e=0.007934day-1,\u03b12=0.001day-1andk=13day-1.The values of b, c and d correspond to life expectancy of 80 years [13], an average incubation period of 6.4 days and infectious period of approximately 4 days [9], respectively. The rate of SARS induced mortality is 0.0079 day-1\n[13]. The rate k is progression from infective to diagnosed and is set to be 1/3 day-1\n[5]. The natural death rate is 0.000034 day-1\n[13], then the rate e is 0.007934 day-1 (summation of natural death rate and SARS induced mortality rate). The basic reproduction number (R0) values for SARS is in the range 2.2 to 3.7 [19], then R0 is selected as 2.7 [19]. Substituting R0=2.7 in (3.4) give the transmission rate(4.20)\u03b2=0.679day-1.For numerical simulations, the initial conditions are assumed to be S(0)=1,100, E(0)=95, I(0), R(0)=0 and C(0)=95. For I(0)=95 corresponds to number of infectious cases on 17 March 2003. The numerical results of model (3.2), (4.18) are shown in Fig. 9, Fig. 10\n. Fig. 9 shows that the number of susceptible individuals decrease whereas the number of exposed, infected and recovered individuals increase. This means that when the disease spread occurs, the number of susceptible individuals decrease since the susceptible individuals contact with infected individuals. Thus, susceptible individuals can require exposed individuals. After 2\u201310 days [9], the exposed individuals is progression to symptoms development, therefore, exposed individual is called infected individuals. After that infected individuals is hospitalized about 3\u20135 days [9] and then infected individuals is becomes recovered individuals. It can be concluded that SARS is highly infectious base on the gradient of the susceptible curve. Fig. 10 shows the predicted total cases obtained by (4.18). The resulting curve for C fits very well with the observed total cases from 17 March 2003 to 26 April 2003 (totally 54 days). This implies that SEIRS model (3.2) can be used to predict the SARS transmission in Hongkong 2003.",

            "text": "Next, an SEIRS model with transport-related infection (2.5) is applied to study the dynamic of SARS during the movement among two cities. It is assumed that the all individuals can travel from one city to another city at the rate \u03b11. It is also assumed that both cities are identical, i.e. the demographic are the same for each city. When the disease spread occurs, the disease is transmitted with transition rate \u03b3\u03b11. Thus, the effect of transport-related infection, \u03b3, is monitored to forecast the total number of infected individuals and duration of its outbreak. In this case the model (2.5) is simulated by using parameter values \u03b11=0.9 and various values of \u03b3: \u03b3=0, \u03b3=0.2 and \u03b3=1, whilst retaining the same values of other parameters in the previous experiment. The initial conditions are used S1(0)=1,100, E1(0)=95, I1(0)=95, R1(0)=0, C1(0)=95, S2(0)=1,100, E2(0)=5, I2(0)=5, R2(0)=0, C2(0)=0. The cumulative number of cases and trajectory of infected individuals, in two cities, are shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 12\n, respectively. The results show that the total number of SARS in both cities increases with increase of \u03b3 (see Fig. 11). It is also seen that the maximum number of infected individuals are 130, 150, 240 and the outbreak reached its peak about 22 days, 20 days, 10 days as \u03b3 increase, \u03b3=0, \u03b3=0.2, \u03b3=1, respectively (see Fig. 12). This confirms that the size and duration of an outbreak can be influenced by transport-related infection. Thus, to reduction and to prevention the spread of SARS, it should have the control measure of the traveling of individual from one city to another city.",

            "text": "This paper presents an SEIRS with transport-related infection for studying the spreading disease during the movement between two cities. The model was rigorously analyzed into three cases in order to gain insights into their qualitative dynamics. The following results are obtained:(i)Each of the three models considered in this study has a locally asymptotically stable if a certain threshold quantity, known as the basic reproduction number, is less than unity; indicating that the number of infectious individual in the community will be brought to zero if public health measures that make (and keep) the threshold to a value less than unity are carried out;(ii)The basic reproduction number of the models (3.2), (3.9) are identical, then the traveling of susceptible and exposed (means exposed but not yet infectious) individuals does not change the dynamics of the corresponding epidemic model when the disease had appeared in both regions. But if the basic reproduction number is greater than unity, the traveling of the exposed individuals can bring the disease from one region to other regions according to Theorem 3.3;(iii)If there is no restriction on the traveling of the exposed and infectious individuals, according to Theorem 3.7 and the discussion behind this theorem, then transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread in the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase when R0\u03b3>1;(iv)The result of the SEIRS model without transport related infections (3.2) is good agreement with the real data of SARS outbreak in Hongkong 2003. When there is the movement of exposed and infectious individuals between two cities, the SEIRS model with transport related infection (2.5) is used to investigate the outbreak of SARS when the individuals in one city travel to another city. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities. This study can be helpful in providing the information to public health authorities and policy maker to reduce spreading disease when its occurs. However, the results of the model (2.5) has not yet forecasted the real size of the SARS epidemics in two city and one can see that in the model (2.5), it is assumed that the two regions share an identical parameter set. It may be necessary to consider two different population sizes and different dispersal rates in order to discuss precisely the impact of the transport-related infection on the disease dynamics. Moreover, to make the model more realistic, gravity models introduced by Murray and Cliff [15] is applied. We leave these to future work.\n",
