Human coronaviruses belong to \u03b1 and \u03b2 genera. [1] Most human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are causes of the common cold, and serious outcomes are rare. Some human \u03b2-coronaviruses have been associated with high morbidity and mortality, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)].[1] In December 2019, novel \u03b2-coronavirus now termed SARS-CoV-2 [[2], [3], [4], [5]] emerged from China, and was associated with high morbidity and mortality in older adults or individuals with underlying medical conditions.[[6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. Due to the severity and spread, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. 2019 coronavirus disease, or COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.[[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]",

            "text": "Laboratory testing for COVID-19 is an essential component of containment and mitigation strategies, as it allows the appropriate clinical management and public health interventions.[[13], [14], [15]] Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) are the methods of choice for SARS CoV-2 diagnostic testing. With the rapid availability of genome sequences [4,16], laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 were quickly developed. The first LDTs relied primarily on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nucleocapsid (N) genes [17,18], but more recent rRT-PCR method targets include open reading frame 1 a/b (Orf1a/b) and the gene encoding spike (S) protein. Recognizing the performance characteristics of PCR methods can vary with reagents, PCR, and instrumentation [19,20], this study compared the analytical sensitivity of LDTs used in hospital and provincial public health laboratories across Canada, as well as some commercially available NAATs that are available in Canada.",

To reduce inter-laboratory variability, specimen preparation, nucleic acid extraction and dilutions were carried out at the NML in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada). The viral stock was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten-fold dilution of RNA was prepared in 10 mM Tris (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher) as a single batch. Five replicates of each dilution were shipped on dry ice to participating sites in sufficient volumes to ensure there would be only a single freeze thaw for each of the five independent experiments. Viral RNA was maintained at \u221270 \u00b0C until tested. The viral RNA used for the relative method comparison was quantified using a standard curve generated with in vitro transcribed RNA (Doc S1). All commercial assays were performed as recommended by the respective manufacturers and the various LDT were performed using reagents, instrumentation, and conditions summarized in Table 1\n. Results of each laboratory\u2019s tests were collated, and the LoD estimated using a Probit analysis (https://biostats.shinyapps.io/LOD_probit/) at a probability of 95%. The LoD of each method was expressed as log10 copies/ml in the PCR reaction, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) (Table 1).",

Given the novelty of the virus, initial Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) case definitions for COVID-19 required laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR with confirmation from either sequencing, or rRT-PCR using a second genetic target. As such, many LDTs were performed in sequential algorithm, or using multiplex rRT-PCRs that enabled simultaneous detection of at least two SARS-CoV-2 targets (Table 1). Most methods were LDTs derived from those developed by the Centers for disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or from published literature.[17,18] While LDTs for COVID-19 testing were quickly implemented in Canadian laboratories, different instruments, reagents, and genetic targets were used.",

Most LDTs had LoDs between 3.4 and 4.5 log10 copies/ml, which is fairly consistent with those reported by others.[17,20] Corman et al [17] reported analytical sensitivities for E gene at RdRp targets at 3.9 [95% CI: 2.8-9.8] and 3.6 copies/reaction [95% CI: 2.7-11.2] copies/reaction, which correlates to 2.9 [95% CI: 2.7-3.3] and 2.9 [95% CI: 2.7-3.4] log10 copies/ml, respectively. In another recent publication, Chan et al. [21] reported analytical sensitivity of 11.2 [95% CI: 7.2-52.6] copies/reaction for RdRp and 21.3 [95% CI: 11.6-177.0] copies/reaction for N gene. These values represent 3.4 [95% CI: 3.2-4.0] log10 copies/ml and 3.6 [95% CI: 3.4-4.5] log10 copies/ml, respectively, which is consistent with values from this study. Only a limited number of methods showed reduced sensitivity. For example, unlike the E gene target in the LightMix 2019-nCoV Real-time RT-PCR kit, the RdRp and N gene targets showed reduced sensitivity. This observation had previously been noted for N gene detection.[17]",

For example, the Allplex 2019-nCoV assay considers detection in any of its three SARS-CoV-2 targets as a positive result. Individually, each target showed LoD between 3.6 and 3.8 log10 copies/ml, whereas a LoD of 2.6 log10 copies/ml was observed with the sum of all results. As detection of SARS-CoV-2 can be variable at the LoD, relying on more than one target could increase the chances of identifying the virus in specimens with low viral loads. Low viral loads can occur in asymptomatic individuals, during the early or late stages of COVID-19 disease, or they could be attributed to improper specimen collection.[13,14] Such variables could greatly affect the performance of any laboratory method, and falls outside the scope of this study.",
