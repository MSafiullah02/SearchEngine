CH-LNCT and CH-MZL were closely correlated with Miller M6, while CH-SH was correlated with Miller M60. These results thus indicate that the existence of Miller, as well as the Purdue cluster, in Chinese field strains of TGEV. Furthermore, we found the first evidence for a large deletion in ORF3 resulting in the loss of ORF3a, previously reported in porcine respiratory coronavirus, in three field strains (CH-LNCT, CH-MZL, and CH-SH) of TGEV. The results of the present study thus provide important information regarding the underlying evolution mechanisms of coronaviruses.",

Porcine respiratory virus can replicate in respiratory tissues in infected piglets and demonstrates selective tropism with very little replication in intestinal tissues (Wang & Zhang, 2015) . Porcine respiratory virus was identified as a TGEV mutant because of their antigenic and genetic relationships, though sequence analysis showed heterogeneity in the S, ORF3a, and ORF3b genes between TGEV and PRCV (Vaughn, Halbur, & Paul, 1995) .",

Multiplex nPCR has also been used to differentiate between PEDV and TGEV infections (Jung, Kim, Kim, Kim, & Chae, 2003) . In this study, we developed an nPCR-based diagnostic field test for the rapid detection of TGEV infection in farmed pigs. Furthermore, we detected TGEV field strains belonging to Miller cluster in China, and also provided the first evidence for a large deletion in ORF3 resulting in the loss of Table S2 . (Paul, Vaughn, & Halbur, 1997) . We tried to isolate the ORF3adeleted TGEV virus from samples prepared as above, but unfortunately were unable to do so (data not shown). (Zhang et al., 2007) . These results suggest that the ORF3 region of the TGEV genome is an important determinant for regulating viral virulence (Zuniga et al., 2016) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus strain 96-1933 is a virulent variant isolated in England in 1996 (Jones & Paton, 1996) , including an intact S gene, but with a deletion in ORF3a. There have been no other relevant reports of ORF3adeleted TGEV until the current study, which demonstrated an 81-nt deletion in ORF3a. However, the locations of the current and 96-1933 deletions differed; gene loss in 96-1933 was due to a discontinuity in ORF3a, while the deletion of TGEV ORF3a in the current study was continuous, which has not previously been reported in TGEV.",

Sequence comparison showed that TGEV Miller strains had a closer relationship with PRCV-ISU-1 compared with Purdue strains. In this study, eight ORF3 sequences belonging to Miller cluster were identified in field strains of TGEV. Furthermore, a novel type of deletion within ORF3a was found in three TGEV field strains, suggesting that some of the differences among ORF3a sequences maybe with regard to PRCV. However, we have not yet succeeded in isolating ORF3a-deleted TGEV, and have therefore been unable to evaluate its pathogenic mechanisms in pigs to date. However, further studies are planned to isolate this virus.",

We also provided novel evidence for the existence of Miller cluster TGEV field strains in Chinese pig populations, indicating the complexity of TGEV field strains in China. Interestingly, we also identify a novel deletion in within ORF3a in three field strains of TGEV, similar to the deletion found in PRCV, thus reflecting the relationship between the TGEV and PRCV. The detected-ORF3a deletion in the CH-LNCT, CH-MZL, and CH-SH strains provides the basis for further evaluation pathogenicity and replication of TGEV, and further studies are needed to determine the role of TGEV ORF3a-deletion field strains in porcine diarrhoea using an animal model. The results of the present study thus provide important information regarding the evolution of coronaviruses.",

These results thus indicate that the existence of Miller, as well as the Purdue cluster, in Chinese field strains of TGEV. Furthermore, we found the first evidence for a large deletion in ORF3 resulting in the loss of ORF3a, previously reported in porcine respiratory coronavirus, in three field strains (CH-LNCT, CH-MZL, and CH-SH) of TGEV. The results of the present study thus provide important information regarding the underlying evolution mechanisms of coronaviruses.

Samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to make 10% (v/v) suspensions. The suspensions were vortexed for 1 min and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 g and the supernatants were collected for RT-nPCR. A volume of 30 ll of viral RNA was extracted from 140 ll of supernatants using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using Oligo d(T)18 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Two primer pairs, TGE-ORF3-F1 and TGE-ORF3-F2, and TGE-ORF3-F1n and TGE-ORF3-F2n (Table S1), were designed and synthesized for RT-nPCR according to the corresponding sequence of TGEV strain H16 (GenBank No. FJ755618). First PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 ll containing 10 ng of cDNA template, 19 EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa), and a 0.5 lM concentration of each primer. After initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, amplification was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, concentration of each primer. After initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, amplification was performed for 30 cycles as the described for the first PCR. The outer span, including primers TGE-ORF3-F1 and TGE-ORF3-F2, was 1602 base pairs (bp), and the inner span, including primers TGE-ORF3-F1n and TGE-ORF3-F2n, was 1417 bp. Fragments containing the full-length TGEV ORF3 gene were amplified from samples using these primers. Furthermore, a pair of primers designated TGEV-d-F1 and TGEV-d-F2 was created to allow the rapid detection of TGEV field strains. PCR products were excised from 1.0% agarose gels, purified using an AxyPrep TM DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Scientific, Inc., CA, USA), cloned into the pMD18-T, and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5a competent cells (TaKaRa) by transformation, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The field strains and their accession numbers are shown in Table S3. The identities among the sequences ranged from 98.6% to 99.9%. Phylogenetic tree analysis of ORF3 showed that the eight TGEV ORF3 genes all belonged to the Miller cluster (Figure 1). CH-SY and CH-ZB were closely correlated with Miller M6, which is a virulent TGEV strain, while CH-SH was correlated with Miller M60, which is an attenuated TGEV strain. Previous reports showed that the Purdue cluster also occurred in China (Weiwei et al., 2014). The current results thus indicate that the Miller, as well as the Purdue cluster, exists in Chinese field strains of TGEV. A large deletion of TGEV strains with the 81-nt deletion. The PCR products of TGE-ORF3-F1 and TGE-ORF3-F2 were used as a template. The PCR products of CH-SDRZ, CH-SY, CH-ZB, and CH-BJ were 420 bp indicating no deletion, while those of CH-LNCT, CH-SH, CH-MZL were 339 bp, indicating the presence of the 81-nt deletion (Figure 2b).
