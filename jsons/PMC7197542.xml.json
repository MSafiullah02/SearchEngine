Demographic variables (gender and age) and variables that were significantly associated (P < .05) with disease progression were included in the multivariable analysis. Areas under the curve (AUCs; with 95% confidence intervals) were computed to assess the diagnostic values of C-reactive protein (CRP); AUCs >0.70 were considered clinically relevant [11]. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve and the log-rank test were applied to further assess the potential risk factors associated with progression. The Youden index was implemented to set cutoff values.

Therefore, health care institutions should also pay close attention to the mild patients, identify progressors early, and provide appropriate treatment to reduce mortality. As reported in a recent article [12], severe COVID-19 patients were older and were more likely to have underlying disease, which is consistent with our study. Nonsevere patients who progressed to severe cases were older and had a higher probability of having underlying diseases. In terms of the symptoms, patients who progressed from nonsevere to severe were more likely to have shortness of breath. Several published articles have also reported a higher rate of shortness of breath in severe COVID-19 patients [5, 12]. Although these exacerbated patients felt dyspnea at an early stage, their blood oxygen saturation did not reach the standard of severe cases, which may be explained by the compensatory effect of faster breathing.",

Generally, CRP level is much higher in bacterial infections than in viral infections [16\u201318]. To our surprise, many COVID-19 patients in this study showed elevated CRP levels, which is in agreement with other studies [12, 19]. Moreover, aggravated cases in this study showed significantly higher levels of CRP than nonsevere patients, which suggested that CRP may be a serum marker of disease aggravation in COVID-19 patients. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CRP was indeed related to disease progression, and ROC analysis and a KM curve confirmed that CRP was a valuable predictor of disease progression in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. What\u2019 s more, the elevated CRP levels occurred before the disease progressed. Therefore, we believe that COVID-19 patients with high levels of CRP should be adequately monitored and treated even though their respiratory function indicators do not meet the criteria for severe cases.",

For example, several indicators may be related to disease progression in univariate regression analysis, while only CRP remains significant in the multivariate analysis. In the future research, these indicators need more attention and analysis. Second, exacerbation of the condition is generally a dynamic process; thus the data at a certain time point may not accurately reflect change in the condition. Third, exacerbation of the remaining mild patients may still occur, because approximately half of the patients were still hospitalized as of February 20, 2020. Thus, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients who may progress from nonsevere to severe still need to be further studied and followed up.",

Mild patients with an older age and underlying diseases were more likely to exacerbate. Elevated CRP level could be a valuable marker to predict the possibility of aggravation of nonsevere COVID-19 patients, which could help health care workers identify those patients at an early stage for early treatment. However, a large sample size and multicenter studies are needed in order to confirm these results.",
