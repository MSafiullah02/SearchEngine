However, the two domains are not necessarily concordant. Patients may be well controlled in the impairment domain and be receiving optimal medications, yet still experience a severe exacerbation.11, 12, 13 The current interest in this aspect of asthma is reflected in numerous recent publications examining exacerbations from various points of view. Furthermore, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has proposed an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma in 201214 and emphasizes the management of exacerbations to be a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment. iCAALL considers \u201cimproved asthma exacerbation treatment\u201d to be \u201can important unmet need\u201d; and thus recommends undertaking core research with a view to developing \u201cnew medication and/or strategies.\u201d The aim of the present study was to provide a review of recent reports on clinical practicability in asthma/wheeze exacerbation, with a particular emphasis on investigations highlighting findings that have not yet been fully discussed in the present guidelines (Table 1\n).

Eighteen percent of children required one or more ED visits due to asthma in the past year.9 In the Asia-Pacific area, unscheduled care (UC) costs were responsible for 18\u201390% of total per-patient direct costs. Overall, total per-patient direct costs were equivalent to 13% of per capita gross domestic product and 300% of per capita healthcare spending,18 which do not include indirect social/economic costs. In Taiwan, the percentages of hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma patients were estimated to be 12% and 25% per year, respectively, which is equivalent to 1.2 in-patient days and 0.59 ED visits per patient per year, respectively.18 An analysis of data collected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research database in 2002 showed that overall health expenditure in pediatric asthma patients was 2.2 times higher than that in patients without asthma, and one-fourth of the cost for asthmatic children was attributed to hospitalization and UC.19\n",

Even among patients with controlled asthma, 43% had an unscheduled visit to a physician's office, 10% had an emergency department visit, and 3% had a hospitalization in the previous year.8 Adequate management of persistent asthma includes treatment with controller medications such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), which have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of severe disease exacerbations.22, 23 Poor adherence to medicine is an important contributing factor to poor asthma control. A recent study24 showed that children with poor adherence to ICS had a 21% increase in ED visits and a 70% increase in hospitalization.",

In Taiwan, Chen et al44 also reported a common variant of a gene coding for the Cala cell 10 kDa protein to be a candidate determinant of asthma severity and steroid response in Chinese asthmatic children. More recently, Bisgaard et al, investigated gene variants associated with asthma and exacerbation in early childhood. Variation at the 17q12-q21 locus was associated with an approximately twofold increased risk of recurrent wheeze, asthma exacerbations, and bronchial hyper-reactivity from early infancy to school age, but without conferring risk of eczema, rhinitis, or allergen sensitization.45 This report adds to the growing evidence of genetic variation in susceptibility to exacerbations, particularly in non-atopic asthma, and further supports the existence of an independent presence of exacerbations. Overall, the finding that genetic variations affect severe exacerbation demonstrates the need to consider the interaction of genes with other known factors in the evaluation of children with frequent exacerbations.",

For young children with previous wheezing attack, a 5-day course of oral prednisolone (10 mg daily for children aged between 10 and 20 months, 20 mg daily for those between 20 and 60 months) was instituted on their admission. Compared with the placebo group, there were no differences in the duration of hospitalization, 7-day symptom score, or albuterol usage.51 Another study of children aged 5\u201312 years with a history of recurrent episodes of acute asthma used the strategy of parent-initiated prednisolone when parents suspected imminent onset of a severe asthma attack based on their previous experience or the absence of improvement in symptoms within 6\u20138 hours. Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day was used for 3\u20135 days depending on the persistence or resolution of their child's asthma symptoms. There was some reduction in asthma symptoms (p = 0.023), health resource use (p = 0.01), and school absenteeism (p = 0.045).52 Overall, the present data suggest that early institution of oral corticosteroid for prevention of severe exacerbation is not recommended.",

In this 12-month, double-blind, randomized study, 341 children aged 4\u201311 years with uncontrolled asthma received regular ICS with an average daily dosage up to budesonide 320 \u03bcg. SMART showed 70% and 79% (p < 0.001) reductions in exacerbation compared with groups receiving high-dose budesonide (320 \u03bcg qd) + terbutaline 0.4 mg as rescue and symbicort 80/4.5 \u03bcg qd + terbutaline 0.4 mg as rescue, respectively. The SMART regimen also reduced mild exacerbation days and nighttime awakening. The yearly height growth was better than that of the high-dose budesonide group. The good result consequently led to several trials using the SMART approach in several countries. In 2011, Cochrane published a meta-analysis of combined fluticasone and salmeterol versus fixed dose combination of budesonide and formoterol for treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children.55 In the present analysis, the SMART regimen was not found to significantly decrease severe exacerbations. The conclusion of this meta-analysis was that the imprecise estimates of exacerbation indicate that further research is warranted. Indeed, more recent studies on the SMART regimen have yielded different results.",

They concluded that asthma education aimed at children (and their caregivers) who present to the ED for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future ED presentation and hospital admission.58 Schatz et al also reviewed evidence of the effectiveness of follow-up after acute asthma episodes.59 Recommendations based on their findings are listed below: (1) telephone reminders of appointments should be used to improve the effectiveness of patient follow-up after the ED visit, and if possible, appointments should be made before leaving the ED; (2) patients' chronic severity should be characterized by items in asthma guidelines; (3) specific elements should be included in the follow-up visit, such as controller, inhaler technique, self-monitoring, individualized asthma action plan, trigger identification, avoidance instruction, and further follow-up plans; (4) patients should be referred to a specialist when indicated.",

Respiratory viruses are now well accepted as the main trigger of these exacerbations, and rhinoviruses remain the most commonly detected pathogens. The interaction of virus and sensitized allergen in pediatric asthma/wheeze patients needs further clarification, which should include the role of genetic variation. At present, early episodic treatment modalities provide some benefit, albeit to a limited extent, in reducing the impact of exacerbation, but more research needs to be done, especially with regard to identifying subgroups of response. In our review of the literature it is apparent that patients with previous severe exacerbation, positive asthma predictive indices, and multiple allergen sensitization require special attention and need to be educated about these aspects of their disease. Pediatricians must be capable of identifying the signs and symptoms of patients with chronic asthma so that families can be educated to detect imminent exacerbation and adhere to the asthma control plan. Referral to a pediatric allergy specialist is indicated in pediatric patients with recurrent exacerbations and persistent asthma.",
