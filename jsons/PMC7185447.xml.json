However, HAdV-11 was the most common in our study, especially in patients with ARDS. Adenovious type 3, 4, 7 and 14 had been reported to be the causative agent of life-threatening adenovirus pneumonia in immnocompetent adult.6, 23 To our knowledge, it is the first report about lift-threatening adenovirus pneumonia caused by HAdV-11. Although little is known about mechanisms of pathogenesis of adenovirus infection, type, mutations or recombinations may result in biological or antigenic changes in the type-specific epitopes in the major viral capsid protein, hexon, which can lead to increased virulence. However, by analyzing the partial hexon nucleotide sequences of HAdVs, we found HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14 strains from our study have very close relationship with corresponding type stains circulating in the Beijing region. Therefore, to evaluate the real level of variation among stains, full-length genome or open reading frame (ORF) sequencing is necessary.",
