            "text": "Coronaviruses [CoVs] belong to the coronavirinae subfamily, in the nidovirales order corona viridae family. There are four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus [41]. CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus, mutation rate is higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism [37].The genome codes for at least 4 major proteins: membrane [M], spike [S], nucleocapside [N], envelope [E] proteins and other accessory proteins that help replicative process and facilitate entry into cells [14]. CoVs can be divided into 3 categories they are category 1 [including human coronavirus 229E [HCoV 229E] and transmissible gastric enteritis virus [TGEV], category 2 [including human CoVs-OC43 [HCoV-OC43], murine hepatitis virus [MHV], and bovine CoVs [BCoV], and category 3 including avain infectious bronchitis virus [IBV] [13]. After the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoVs [SARS-CoV] in 2003, category 2 coronavirus were further categories into 2 subgroups, termed 2A and 2B. The classical category 2 viruses constitute subgroup 2A, while the newly emergent SARS-CoV and its animal counterparts from sub-category 2B. Category 1 and 2 of CoVs has a greater impact on human health then category 3, since category 3 of CoVs [such an avian IBV] can affect only avian organisms [18].",

A DPP4 binding enzyme, adenosine deaminase, is known as one of the key blockers of CoV\u2019s S protein [30]. Two ecto-domains of the S protein can be classified into fusion-catalyzing [FD] and RBD. The S RBDs adhere to DPP4, after which they reveal the FDs by unfolding. The unfolding FD has allowed host proteases to cleavage S protein. Cleavage at S1/S2 [specific proteolytic cleavage sites between the FD and RBD] location is necessary for CoVs infection in Calu3 cells. It was discovered that after infection, monocytes chemo attractants protein-1 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 were stimulated and the multiplication of human myeloid progenitor cells was inhibited. CoV can contaminate T-cells from mammalian lymphoid organs and trigger peripheral blood to induce apoptosis via intrinsic and extrinsic tracts [2]. A study showed that the inactivation of DPP4 minimized the initiation of PPAR\u03c0 [transcriptional repressor] and IRAKM [negative TLR signaling regulator] which suggested that DPP4 controlled the immunosuppressive intervention of S glycoprotein [6].",

In the exclusion of MDA5 and RIG-1, CoVs utilized protein such as 4a [p4a], containing RNA-binding domain to attachment [4]. The motif covers the CoVs dsRNA by a simple attachment. The p4a has \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 folding with the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop and \u03b11helix binding to the small dsRNA groove. In a study, it was proposed that NF-\u03baB persist in the cytoplasm of infected cells while 4b was figured to be linked to the nucleus. In the lack of 4b, it was found that the distribution of pro-inflammatory cytokines was translocated to the nucleus as NF-\u03baB. This was also found in the case of 4b mutants which do not have a nuclear localization signal, suggesting that the 4b controlled mechanism of nuclear localization signal is necessary for the expression of NF-\u03baB [29]. In the ER-Golgi complex the proteins M, E, and S interact with N protein. This interaction hampers the fusion of cellular and viral membranes [23]. CoV M protein associated with TRAF3 and involvement of disturbed TRAF3\u2013TBK1 contribute to decreased stimulation of IRF3 [50].",

            "text": "Coronavirus can easily contaminate human epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [25]. A study defined that CoV-infected cells showed unique alterations in chromatin frameworks such as repressive histone markers, which could restrict transcription factors from attaching to interferon-stimulated gene promoter regions [26]. The alteration in DNA methylation have been shown to be one of the factors for IFN-\u03b3-associated antigen-presenting gene declining after infection [46]. CoV proteins such as 4a, 4b, M and PLpro were observed to inhibit interferon initiation [20]. Viral infection was identified with delayed activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL6, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 [7, 49]. Immature dendritic cells could not activate T-cells after antigen absorption, preventing the triggering of T-cells and allowing for more viral replication [7]. Human macrophage infection has led to the interpretation of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as MCP-1/CCL-2, IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b12, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL-3, IP10/CXCL-10, RANTES/CCL-5, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12p40, and IL-6 [19, 47]. The contaminated dendritic cells stimulated IL-12, RANTES/CCL-5, IP-10/CXCL10 and IFN-\u03b3 expression, and displayed a weak IFN-\u03b1 expression and no IFN-\u03b2 expression [47]. The type-I IFN stimulated secretion of IL-10 and CXCL10 can direct T-cells to the infection site. Their unregulated and powerful interpretation the IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 expression was hindered and the uptake of T-helper cells was prohibited. The functions of T-cells get hindered with down-regulated antigen exposure pathways. The sequestered T cells had therefore failed to target the virus [40].",

The antimalarial drug chloroquine is found effective for CoV by diminishing inflammation in people with severe COVID-19, or cause harm. Chloroquine inhibited replication of SARS in cell culture [1]. Remdesivir, a prodrug, gets metabolizes to its dynamic form GS-441524. GS-441524 is an adenosine nucleotide analog that confuses the viral RNA polymerase and avoids reading by viral exoribonuclease [ExoN], producing a diminution in viral RNA production [22]. It inhibits viral polymerase activity, shutting down transcription and synthesis of viral RNA [36]. The intravenous remdesivir [200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days] in patients with 2019-nCoV [NCT04252664 and NCT04257656], with estimated to be completed in April 2020 [27]. Recently, on this February, an antiviral drug named Favilavir [Fapilavir] was found effective against CoV. It is the first drug to get approved for marketing as a novel anti-CoV drug. Therapeutic approach/clinical trial approach of drugs have been shown in Table 1.",

This system was used for genetic analysis of SARS-CoV protein functions and will be enabled researchers to engineer specific attenuating mutations or modifications into the genome of the virus to develop live attenuated vaccines [10]. Although live attenuated vaccines targeting respiratory viruses, including adenoviruses and influenza, were approved for use in humans. The infectious virus accumulated in the feces of individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV raises concerns that a live attenuated SARS-CoV vaccine stain may also be deposited in feces, with the potential to spread to unvaccinated people [39]. Another concern is the risk of recombining a live attenuated vaccine virus with wild-type CoV; moreover, ways of engineering the vaccine virus genome to minimize this risk [12].",

Among all SARS-CoVs structural proteins, S protein is the primary antigenic component responsible for neutralizing antibodies, inducing host immune responses and/or protecting immunity against infection by viruses [42]. It also evaluated combination vaccines for their ability to increase immune responses. Two dose of a DNA vaccine encoding the S protein, followed by immunization with inactivated whole virus, were shown more immunogenic in mice than either type of vaccine alone [48]. The combination vaccine triggered high immune responses, both humorally and cell-mediated. Combination vaccines can increase the effectiveness of the candidates for the DNA vaccine. In addition, the lessons learned from these vaccinations will aid in the development of future vaccines against established and newly identified coronavirus [8, 10, 42].",
