Specifically, central obesity which is characterized by an excessive deposition of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the abdominal cavity has been more strongly associated with CVD and mortality than general obesity (Sahakyan et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016; Yusuf et al. 2005). It has also been shown that improving modifiable risk factors for CVD may also reduce further comorbidities later in life including disability and frailty (Atkins et al. 2019).",

Therefore, there is a need to explore novel approaches for promoting physical activity (PA) to counteract the detrimental effects of insufficient activity and obesity and their economic burden (Ding et al. 2016; Oldridge 2008; Withrow and Alter 2011). Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the Internet users (Internet Society 2017) and subsequently a rise also in the number of digital health interventions. The previous reviews have concluded that digital health interventions may have positive effects on outcomes such as PA and quality of life (Cotie et al. 2018; Foster et al. 2013; Geraedts et al. 2013; Jahangiry et al. 2017; Sch\u00e4fer et al. 2018), and among the unique advantages of these interventions are cost-efficiency, accessibility and convenience, including 24-h access to intervention material (Joseph et al. 2014; Lewis et al. 2010; Oh et al. 2005; World Health Organization 2016). In light of this, digital tools (e.g., web-based or smart device applications) may be plausible for delivering wide-spread, effective and cost-efficient exercise interventions in a home-based setting.",

In addition, these reviews included multicomponent interventions and did not restrict their inclusion criteria to exercise-only interventions, thus making it impossible to determine the exercise-specific effects on measures of central obesity. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to systematically review the potential benefits of digital exercise-only interventions for improving measures of central obesity in overweight or centrally obese adults. Outcome measures included VAT, waist circumference (WC), waist\u2013hip ratio (WHR), sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), body fat percentage (BFP), body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI).",

These domains are as follows: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; other bias. For the purpose of this review, other bias was judged depending on whether central obesity was measured using anthropometric surrogates or direct measures of using imaging techniques, considering the latter are considered the gold standard for quantifying visceral adiposity (Shuster et al. 2012). A summary figure of the assessed bias of the included studies was created using Review Manager v.5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration 2014).",

The highest risk of bias resulted from \u2018other bias\u2019, in terms of the absence of direct techniques for measuring central obesity which was the case for 100% of the included studies. Similarly, 60% of the studies did not state whether the outcome assessment was blinded or not. Additionally, in one study Akinci et al. (2018), there was a high risk of attrition bias given that inappropriate methods were employed for handling missing data, resulting in potentially over-estimated effects. Also, data on changes in body fat were not reported in this study despite stated in the pre-registered study protocol. While these values would have been of benefit to the present review, unfortunately, they were not reported. This would have been of value for the present systematic review and thereby resulted in a high risk of reporting bias. Blinding of participants was either not performed or sufficiently described in 60% of the studies. In general, blinding is not possible in exercise trials due to participants usually being aware of whether they receive the intervention or not. For this reason, the studies that did not address blinding were therefore not considered as a source of high risk of bias in the present systematic review.",

Given the large heterogeneity in study design and that two studies did not have a control group, it was not justified to perform a meta-analysis. Thus, additional high-quality randomized controlled trials with a more similar design are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Future trials should also employ longer interventions as this may result in larger effects (Clark 2016), which would be valuable in order to make inferences on sustained long-term benefits. Furthermore, none of the included studies objectively measured VAT. This would be valuable in order to explore the benefits of digital exercise on measures of central obesity more accurately, as WC alone may be an insufficient measure of central obesity given its inability to differentiate visceral from subcutaneous adiposity (Despr\u00e9s et al. 2008). Objective measurements also facilitate the detection of small changes in obese individuals (Shuster et al. 2012) whereas anthropometric surrogates can be difficult to apply in these individuals with respect to their body shape, thus risking impaired precision in outcome assessment. Also, as reflected in our bias assessment, it was unclear whether all outcome assessments were blinded or not, and it is possible that this may have influenced the results of the WC measurements. Finally, additional studies would also enable future subgroup analyses based on key factors e.g., intervention specifics; duration; measurement tools; degree of obesity; and sex. Especially, considering that there appears to be sex-specific responses to exercise in terms of visceral and total fat loss (Kuk and Ross 2009; Link and Reue 2017).",

This systematic review is also timely in an era where the health care is becoming more digitalized (Kostkova 2015) and the prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity remains high. Furthermore, despite that a healthy diet is a well-established cornerstone in the treatment of obesity (Jensen et al. 2014), evaluating the unique effects pertaining to exercise is a strength and may have other advantages. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and for some people, it may be easier to start an exercise regime than to change their dietary habits. By starting to exercise, one could also potentially experience positive spin-off effects, as shown in a recent study where 12 weeks of exercise decreased wanting scores for high-fat foods and trait binge eating in overweight and obese individuals (Beaulieu et al. 2020). Finally, in this review, we have highlighted the fact that while many digital health applications promoting physical activity exist on the market today, very few have been tested in controlled studies (Byambasuren et al. 2018). It is therefore of interest to not only develop novel and innovative digital solutions, but essentially, they need to be evaluated. Specifically, this review exposes a gap in the field of research on studies evaluating the effectiveness of digital exercise interventions for reducing central obesity both in the short and long term as no studies have not factored in the key indicator VAT into their design and development.",
