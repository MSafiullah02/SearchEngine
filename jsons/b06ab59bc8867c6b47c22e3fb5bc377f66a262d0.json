Many patients with COVID-19 require some form of respiratory support and often have prolonged ICU stays, which results in a critical shortage of ICU beds. It is therefore not always physically possible to treat all the patients who require intensive care, raising major ethical dilemmas related to which patients should benefit from the limited resources and which should not. Here we consider some of the approaches to the acute shortages seen during this and other epidemics, including some guidelines for triaging ICU admissions and treatments.",

The number of admissions to ICUs is expected to continue to increase in many countries for some time to come. About one-tenth of patients with COVID-19 will require some form of ventilatory support (invasive and non-invasive) on ICUs that are already (almost) full under normal circumstances. The lesions of COVID-19 are potentially reversible, so that efforts to support patients must be sustained. But the acute course of the disease can last many days and even weeks, so that bed occupancy is often prolonged, resulting in a critical shortage of ICU bed availability and ventilators.",

Admitting patients who are going to die, regardless of any medical effort, is not acceptable (Figure 1 ). Similarly, patients who are not very severely ill and do not really require 'intensive care' should not be admitted. Discharge from the ICU earlier than usual may also be encouraged, especially when some form of respiratory support can be continued outside the ICU. Intensive care admission can thus be denied or discharge advanced for some patients who are most likely to die and also for patients who are likely to do well. In a crisis situation, as at present, these two extreme ends of the spectrum will expand, thus effectively increasing the numbers of available ICU beds (Figure 1 ).",

When resources are scarce, distributive justice supports their distribution to those most likely to benefit.

The number of beds likely to be needed is therefore fairly easy to predict. In epidemics, it is difficult to predict how many patients will become infected and need ICU admission. 2. In a catastrophe, there is a one-off trigger event and the acute situation is limited in time. Some patients may deteriorate over subsequent days, but these are usually limited in number, and this is not generally a major challenge. The amplitude of the problem is quickly appreciated. In epidemics, patients continue to be infected over a prolonged, and generally difficult to predict, period of time, with initially small numbers of cases increasing often rapidly over a period of days, weeks or even months. 3. In a catastrophe, healthcare staff are generally not affected and there are many who can be called in to help. In epidemics, some of the specialized personnel will also become ill or need to be quarantined and, over time, it can be increasingly difficult to replace them. 4. In a catastrophe, patient transfer is usually possible from one centre (often the hospital or clinic closest to the catastrophe) to other more specialized centres. In epidemics, this is particularly difficult because of the extra hygiene measures necessary to protect staff and other patients and the fact that most, if not all, hospitals will be under similar pressure with shortages of staff, beds and equipment. 5. In a catastrophe, most hospitals have established disaster plans in place, which are periodically enacted and can be activated immediately. In epidemics that affect several regions or countries sequentially, hospitals may have some time to prepare for the arrival of the epidemic in their country, to already start to reorganize the hospital to free up ICU beds, and to establish rules of triage and approaches to the likely difficult ethical decisions that will be faced. They can also learn from the approaches implemented by other affected countries.",

The numbers of ICU beds within each hospital are usually relatively small and they are generally well occupied. The obvious solution to lack of ICU bed availability is to somehow increase the number of beds available for critically ill patients (Table 1 ). This could be achieved by transforming less sophisticated units, such as recovery rooms, coronary care units or stroke units, into ICUs. This raises potential problems, however, related to obtaining sufficient numbers of trained staff for the extra beds. A second option is to perform some interventions normally reserved for the ICU on general wards. There are three types of ICU treatment that cannot be provided elsewhere: mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure and cardiovascular support for acute circulatory failure (shock). In the case of COVID-19, one could consider using some forms of respiratory support, such as high flow oxygen therapy, continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive respiratory support, outside the ICU, even though there is a risk if staff are not familiar with these techniques or trained to use them.",

An elderly patient who is independent and active, with no previous medical conditions, may take precedence over a younger individual with advanced cancer, severe heart failure or alcoholic cirrhosis. Indeed, life expectancy is perhaps more important than age: excluding patients with a predicted life expectancy <1 year could be considered. 2. Frailty is an important element. Past history and comorbidities, including the degree of chronic organ failure, must be taken into account. 3. Individual preferences should also be taken into account and should be discussed early in the disease process whenever possible, regardless of whether there is an explicit advanced care plan. Other patients than those with COVID-19 may also need intensive care. It is important not to become so focused on COVID-19 that the treatment of patients who also need ICU care but do not have the disease is compromised. There is a real risk of 'forgetting' patients who are not directly affected by the ongoing epidemic, but whose survival may be reduced by the interruption of planned elective surgical interventions, outpatient clinics and reduced availability of ICU resources.

Every admission to the ICU, even outside the epidemic crisis, can be considered as an 'ICU trial'. 1 The appropriateness of life-sustaining treatments should be re-evaluated on a daily basis, taking into account all patient-related factors, including the clinical course, complications and response to treatment.

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score was proposed as a triage tool in previous epidemics, with patients with very low or very high scores given low priority for ICU admission, 4 and is being used by some institutions in the current pandemic. A Clinical Frailty Score 5 could also be calculated, as has been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK. 6 These scores, combined with other factors including clinical evaluation, age and comorbid conditions, could potentially be used to create a priority score to guide limited resource allocation. 7 Working closely with other medical disciplines, including geriatric medicine, can help in these complex decisions.",
