Pneumococcal/SPN colonisation rates also vary with geographical location, genetics and socioeconomic background [2] . SPN colonisation is a dynamic process. Although multiple SPN serotypes can both simultaneously and sequentially colonise, one serotype is usually the predominant current coloniser [3] . In addition interspecies competition occurs between resident flora and potential colonisers including S.pneumoniae, H.influenzae and S.aureus [4] .",

Other studies have reported a relationship between symptom severity, pneumococcal density and pneumococcal/viral co-colonisation in children [10] . Pneumococcal colonisation may cause nasal symptoms in two ways; the bacteria could induce host secretions and inflammatory responses or in co-colonised individuals (pneumococcus and virus) due to viral proliferation inducing rhinitis [9] .

Higher symptom severity scores were not a predictor for colonisation. SPN colonisation is more common in children; therefore, a limitation of this work is the lack of generalisability of results to all age groups, however reasonable evidence exists that SPN colonisation in children does cause nasal symptoms [10, 17] . Another limitation is that only one serotype was assessed in this study, SPN 6B. This particular serotype is not thought to be present in the community and therefore it is very unlikely that the participants would have pre-existing immunity from previous exposure. A previous study suggested that the presence of symptoms could be dependent on the serotype of pneumococcus [17] . The authors reported that colonisation with serotype 19F was strongly associated with symptoms such as coryza, sneezing, cough and expectoration. However, these children were recruited from a paediatric hospital emergency room, the study did not report on the diagnosis given to these patients therefore upper or lower respiratory infection may have been the cause of these symptoms rather than solely SPN colonisation [17] .",
