This calls for further deeper investigations at the frontier of biology and physico-chemistry, involving drug titration, modelisation of hydrolysis at the air\u2013water interface and in membrane models, in order to understand why 3 and not 6 exhibit an activity, evaluation of the role of the calixarene moiety vs possible synergistic effects, as well as evaluation of antibacterial properties of other lipophilic prodrug-like designed calixarene derivatives.",
