Past studies proved that human mobility networkslike air transportation (Colizza et al., 2006; Balcan et al., 2009) or waterways Gatto et al., 2012 )-could transport pathogens or contagious individuals to widespread locations, leading to the outbreak of epidemics. Recently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 confirmed the strong connection between human mobility network and disease dynamics. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China, at the beginning of Dec. 2019, and has then quickly spread to the rest of China through airlines and high-speed rail networks during the Spring Festival travel season (Wu et al., 2020) . Besides the transmissions of pathogens to destination local communities via human mobility network, the densely populated urban public transit (PT) network, however, may also become a key mediate in the spreading of influenza-like epidemics with public transport carriers being the location of transmission (Sun et al., 2013 ).",

The urban PT system is often framed as a key solution for building sustainable cities with concerns of environment, economy, and society's effectiveness (Miller et al., 2016) . But the indoor environment created by crowded metro carriages or buses can also make an infected individual easily transmit the pathogen to others via droplets or airborne routes (Xie et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009) . In recent years, scholars began to turn their attention to the spreading of the epidemic through the urban PT network.",

Besides, most of the previous studies focused on understanding epidemic spreading and identifying the risks in the PT system. Few studies have discussed the PT operation-related epidemic control strategies. PT operation plays an important role in controlling epidemics. Recently, a variety of epidemic control strategies in PT systems have been implemented to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19 since late January 2020.

However, static networks are only approximations of the real interplay between time scales. Considering daily mobility patterns, no individual is in contact with all the friends simultaneously all the time. On the contrary, contacts are changing in time, often on a time scale that is shorter than the whole spreading process. Real contact networks are thus inherently dynamic, with connections appearing, disappearing, and being rewired with different characteristic time scales, and are better represented in terms of a temporal or time-varying network. Therefore, modeling the epidemic process on PT should be based on a time-varying contact network.",

The infectious rate, \u03b2, controls the rate of spread and is associated with the probability of transmitting disease between a susceptible (S) and an exposed individual (E). The incubation rate, \u03b3, is the rate of exposed individuals (E) becoming infectious (I). Removed rate, \u00b5, is the combination of recovery and death rates. The SEIR model typically assumes the recovered individuals will not be infected again, given the immunization obtained. It is worth noting that this study focuses on the early stage of an epidemic process, where the impact of outside factors on N (e.g., birth and natural death) are not considered. For the epidemic process models, people are concerned about the steady-state, epidemic threshold and reproduction number. According to Pastor-Satorras et al. (2015) , the number of infected individuals in the SEIR model always tends to zero after a long term (see Figure 3a ). This is obvious from the diagram of SEIR (Figure 2) , where there is only one recurrent state R. The basic reproduction number, denoted by R 0 , is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a primary case introduced in a fully susceptible population (Anderson et al., 1992) . In the standard SEIR model, we have R 0 = \u03b2 \u00b5 . Epidemic threshold, in many cases, is defined based on the value of R 0 . When R 0 < 1, the number of infectious individuals tends to decay exponentially; thus, there is no epidemic. However, if R 0 > 1, the number of infectious individuals could grow exponentially with an outbreak of epidemic (see Figure 3b ). ",

Both The property of the contact network is essential for analyzing the epidemic spreading. Figure 8 summarizes the degree and CD distribution of PEN and LIN. Note that the global interaction network is, by definition, a simple random graph with homogeneous structures. Hence, we did not plot it. Given the time-varying properties of networks, we consider three different time intervals: morning peak (8:00-9:00 AM), noon off-peak (12:00-13:00), and evening peak (18:00-19:00). Figures 8a and 8b show that the degree distribution of PEN displays a power-law tail (P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03bb k , where k is the degree), implying a significant degree heterogeneity. Most of the nodes are of low or medium degree. The number of super-nodes with a high degree is limited, and the maximum degree is bounded, which is reasonable given the limited capacity of buses. These properties are consistent with the findings in Qian et al. (2020) and indicate that PENs are a type of small-world network (Telesford et al., 2011) . Although the shapes of P (k) for different times are similar, the exact values are still time-dependent. On weekdays, P (k) for morning and evening peaks are similar but different from the off-peak curve. PENs in peak hours also have a larger degree of nodes. On weekends, however, the degree distributions in the three time intervals are similar. Figures 8c and 8d show the degree distribution of the LIN (\u03b8 l = 1\u00d7 10 \u22123 is used to correspond to the case study in the following sections). Similar to PEN distribution, a power-law tail is also observed. However, the degree distribution in LINs is less concentrated and shows noisy patterns for high degree distributions. We also find that other local CD values are nearly uniformly distributed. Since local interaction duration that does not equal 30 or 60 min indicates that the trip occurs or ends in this time interval, the uniform distribution implies a Poisson start and end time of bus trips within the time interval.",

Time from exposure to onset of symptoms (latent or incubation period) is generally between 2 to 14 days for COVID-19. Read et al. (2020) suggested setting the latent period as 4 days. We, therefore, have \u03b3 = 1 24\u00d74 = 0.0104 (probability from E to I per h). According to Read et al. (2020) , the transmission rate of COVID-19 in the static SEIR model is 1.96 day \u22121 , which can be seen as the number of people that one infectious person can infect per day in a well-mixed network. Therefore, assuming one person, on average, has close contact with 100 others per day, we can calculate the hourly one-to-one infectious probability as \u03b2 I = 1.96 24\u00d7100 = 8.17 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Although recent studies show \u03b2 E > 0 for COVID-19 (Rothe et al., 2020) , calibrating the exact value of \u03b2 E is difficult due to lack of data. Since people in the latent period (group E) usually have extremely lower probability of transmission, we arbitrarily set \u03b2 E = 0.01\u03b2 I . We calculate \u00b5 r and \u00b5 d using data from Wuhan. Figure 10 shows the daily cure and death rate (number of cured/dead people per day divided by the total number of confirmed people on that day) in Wuhan. The reason for the high value on the first day may be the inaccurate data. From Figure 10 , we observe the average daily cure and death rate are approximately 1% at the early stage. Therefore, we can calculate the hourly cured and death probability as \u00b5 r = \u00b5 d = 0.01 24 = 4.17 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Figure 10 : Daily cure and death rate in Wuhan (data sources: Ding Xiang Yuan (2020)) \u03b8 l = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 is used for the status quo analysis. This value is calculated as follows. Consider a community with 10,000 people, assume each person may have close contact with another 10 people on average per hour locally. We therefore have \u03b8 l = 10 10,000 = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The global interaction captures individual's probability of close contact with people outside his/her community. Given that the population of Singapore is around 5.6 million, we assume one person, on average, can closely contact 10 people per day globally. Then \u03b8 g = 10 5.6\u00d710 6 \u00d724 = 7.44 \u00d7 10 \u22128 . Note that the number 24 in the denominator is used to get the hourly probability. Table 1 summarizes all parameters of the status quo analysis, which can be seen as the reference scenario.",

Figure 14 shows the impact of \u03b2 I and \u00b5 on equivalent R 0 . \u03b2 I is scaled from 10 \u22122 to 10 1 and \u00b5 is scaled from 10 \u22121 to 10 2 . We fixed \u03b2 E = 0.01\u03b2 I for all testing. Figure 14b shows that the epidemics would fade out (equivalent R 0 < 1) if transmissibility was reduced to less than 10 \u22121 of current value. However, Figure   14c suggests that even if the cure rate is increased by 100 times, the epidemics would still happen, though the process would be lagged (with smaller R 0 ). This implies reducing transmissibility is more effective than increasing the cure rate for COVID-19. In Figure 14a , we show the joint impact of \u03b2 I and \u00b5 and the critical bound of equivalent R 0 . If \u03b2 I was decreased to 32% and \u00b5 was enlarged tenfold, the equivalent R 0 would be decreased to less than 1.

Figure 15 shows the impact of different control percentage of trips (i.e., reducing the percentage of total contact and squared contact time). We observe that controlling one trip (PT or local or global) cannot eliminate the epidemic. Based on current parameter settings, reducing PT trips contribute more to the control of the epidemic process than the other two. The impact of reducing trips to R 0 is generally linear unless the reduction percentage is sufficiently large. When all trips are reduced by more than 80%, the reduction rate for R 0 starts to accelerate. When all trips were decreased by 98%, the spreading process would fade out, which implies travel control can only be effective at an extreme level. This is corresponding to Wu et al. (2020) 's statement that a 50% reduction in inter-city mobility in Wuhan has a negligible effect on the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics. Figure 16 shows the influence of distributing departure time with different flexibility (from 0 to \u00b1110 min). Note that the benchmark equivalent R 0 is 1.763 for the sample passengers situation, rather than 2.67 as the whole population situation because fewer passengers in the system can reduce the human contacts and limit the epidemic process. We observe a decline in equivalent R 0 as the departure time flexibility increases. This is because higher flexibility allows more dispersed riding on the bus; thus, fewer contacted passengers. However, the effectiveness of distributing passengers is very limited. With \u00b1110 min flexibility, there is only a 1.6% decrease in R 0 (from 1.763 to 1.740). ",

            "text": "It is also important to look at how many passengers are affected by each strategy. The affected passengers are defined as those who cannot find alternative bus routes when the original routes are closed. As expected, for the same closing percentage of bus routes, the H-L strategy affected more passengers than the other two policies. However, we find that the H-L strategy is more effective in terms of R 0 reduction per affected passengers. If we fix the percentage of affected passengers at approximately 22% (black dashed line), the H-L strategy can reduce R 0 to 1.63, while random and L-H strategies can only reduce R 0 to 1.68 and 1.69, respectively. This may be because passengers in high demand bus routes are more influential (e.g., with a higher degree in the PEN) in the system. Therefore, to control the epidemic with fewer people getting affected, PT agencies should close buses from high to low demand routes. Figure 18a shows the percentage of reduction in R 0 resulting from the closure of bus routes by planning areas, while Figure 18b shows the corresponding percentage of affected PT passengers. Generally, the high reduction in R 0 is the result of a high number of affected passengers. Closing bus routes in the main business and residential areas in the Southern part of Singapore Island leads to higher controlling effects of epidemics than closing other areas. However, to minimize the impact on passengers' daily travel, PT agencies should first close bus routes in regions with relatively high R 0 reduction and a low number of affected passengers, such as core central business district (CBD) areas. Passengers who take buses crossing core CBD areas can easily find alternative routes. Thus, the concentrated demands at CBD areas can be distributed to other less crowded routes, which leads to a R 0 reduction and less number of affected passengers. ",

            "text": "Although closing bus routes can postpone the epidemic spreading, it also brings huge inconvenience to society, for example, decreasing people's accessibility to hospitals. A moderate alternative way is preserving the PT supplies but limiting the maximum bus load to reduce passengers' interaction. Figure 19 shows the impact of this policy. Since we use 100k sample data, the maximum bus load is relatively small. Hence, we test the maximum bus load from 10 to 2. Passengers who cannot board the bus due to this policy are assumed to cancel their trips (these passengers are called affected passengers). To compare with closing bus routes strategies, the x-axis is set as the percentage of affected passengers. Only the H-L strategy is plotted as it is the most effective one among all closing bus routes strategies. We find the policy of limiting the maximum bus load can only take effects when the available maximum bus load is very small. With the same percentage of affected passengers, it is not as effective as closing bus routes from high demand to low demand. However, since this policy preserves the city's mobility capacity, it can be seen as a more moderate way to control epidemics compared with directly closing bus routes. Figure 19 : Impact of limiting maximum bus load (100k sample passengers). MBL: maximum bus load. CP: close percentage of the H-L strategy 3.5.6. Impact of isolating critical passengers Ideally, a more precise pandemic policy goes into the individual-level. The government could find out those influential passengers who are potential to spread viruses considerably and get them isolated at an early stage. Individual-based policies can outperform region-based or population-level policies in effectiveness and flexibility. However, due to the computational cost, it is hard to optimize the isolation options for each individual directly. Hence, we employed an isolation method based on k-core decomposition. Different from traditional degree-based methods, k-core method shows higher impacts on the dynamics of multi-particle systems (Kitsak et al., 2010; Morone et al., 2019; Borge-Holthoefer and Moreno, 2012; Yang et al., 2017) .",

Each vertex in a k-core is connected to at least k other nodes (i.e., has a degree of at least k). A high k number represents the highly concentrated structure of the local network, which indicates the most clustered part in the whole network. Nodes in a core with larger k usually have larger degrees on average (Dorogovtsev et al., 2006) . In the context of infectious diseases, if one node in a high k-core is infected, it has, on expectation, > k 2 times chances to spread the disease to other nodes in that core in one-time step compared to an arbitrary node (if the network is under scaling law) (Serrano and Bogun\u00e1, 2006) . Therefore, we designed the policy by first limiting the nodes in high k-cores, which means limiting the more influential nodes. The population in a higher k-core is always lower than that in a lower k-core. Thus, by applying this policy, we can isolate a small portion of people to limit the spreading of the disease. Figure 20 shows the impact of isolating passengers in different k-cores and the corresponding number of isolated passengers. For comparison purposes, we also evaluate a random policy. For each k-core, the random policy isolates the same number of randomly picked passengers in the system, which corresponds to implementing isolation at the population level. Since the number of passengers with a core number greater than 5 is low (in the 100k sample passengers case), the reduction in R 0 is not significant. However, isolating all 4-core passengers, which accounts for 5% of the whole population, the equivalent R 0 is reduced from 1.76 to 1.66 (5.7%), which shows higher effectiveness than any other region-based or route-based policies in Section 3.5.4. We also observe that the k-core isolating method can outperform the benchmark random isolating method. Figure 20 : Impact of isolating critical passengers (100k sample passengers). \"base\" and \"k-core\" scenarios indicate no isolation and isolation of people of core number \u2265 k in the PEN, respectively.",

The status-quo analysis shows that the COVID-19 infected population is expected to increase by 100 times of their initial value by the end of the month without any disease control enforcement. A series of disease control and prevention scenarios are envisioned from both public health policy and PT operations sides. From the public health side, the model sheds light on people's preventative behavior. Wearing face masks and sanitizing hands, are considered the most effective measures to control the spreading of the epidemic; however, an increased cure rate can only postpone the outbreak of the disease. From the perspective of PT operation adjustments, several policies are evaluated, including reducing trip occurrences, enlarging departure time flexibility, closing bus routes, limiting maximum bus loads, and isolating critical passengers. In general, the control of the epidemic process starts to take effect, with over 80% of all trips being canceled. The equivalent R 0 can be reduced to 1 if over 98% of trips are banned. In terms of bus operation policies, distributing departure times and limiting maximum bus loads can slightly decelerate the spreading process. Closing high-demand bus routes, especially in the main business areas, is more effective than the closure of low-demand bus routes. The most effective approach is isolating influential passengers at the early stage, in which the epidemic process can be significantly reduced with a small proportion of people being affected.",

In the real world, many unexpected results can happen. For example, closing bus routes may decrease people's accessibility to the hospital, thus, decrease the cure rate. The government should think cautiously from multiple perspectives before applying any control strategies. 3) This study did not model the contacts of passengers at trains due to difficulties in identifying the vehicles that passengers belong to. Future research can incorporate a transit assignment model (e.g., Zhu et al., 2017; Mo et al., 2020) to infer passengers' boarding trains and construct the PEN by trains. Meanwhile, due to the large space in a train, the variation of transmission probability due to passengers' spatial distribution should also be captured. 4) Other modes of transmission than contact transmission are not considered (e.g., infectious passengers contaminating surfaces), which may result in under-estimation of transmissibility of PT systems. 5) Population infected heterogeneity is neglected in this study.

The red squares in (g) and (d) represent the value of P (CD = 30 min) and P (CD = 60 min).The Figures 8e and 8f, show that the contact time of PEN follows an exponential tail (P (CD) \u223c e \u2212 CD \u03bb cd ), which is similar to the trip duration distribution(Figure 6a). There are more contacts with duration less than 10 min in noon off-peak compared to morning and evening peaks on weekdays, while P (CD) for the three time intervals on weekends are similar. By definition, the contact time of time-varying PEN is bounded by 60 min (same for the LIN).Figures 8g and 8h present the CD distribution of LINs. We observe a huge concentration on CD = 30 min and CD = 60 min (see the red squares). This is because people are not traveling most of the day-time. Thus, for a specific time interval, the duration of local interactions, for most individuals, would cover the whole time interval given our definition of LINs. However, since we assume people only spend half of their time on a specific origin or destination of a PT trip (see Section 2.1.2), the local CD for two people without travel within the time interval is either 30 min (if two individuals only share a single origin or destination) or 60 min (if two individuals share both origin and destination). Therefore, there are two concentrations with CD = 30 min and CD = 60 min. As P (CD = 30) > P (CD = 60), most people will only locally interact with others in one place (e.g., either at home or workplace).",

Impact of distributing departure time From a transportation perspective, the trip concentration in morning and evening peaks can strengthen people's interaction in PT. It is possible to reduce people's contact time on PT by distributing their departure time. The distributing process is as follows. Given the departure time flexibility constraints (e.g., \u00b130 min), we generate new departure time for passengers so that passengers with the same boarding stops are assigned to different buses as dispersed as possible. Since the operation is conducted at the individual level, we conduct the policy evaluation with sample passengers (100k) instead of the whole population, given the computational challenge in preparing the data.",
