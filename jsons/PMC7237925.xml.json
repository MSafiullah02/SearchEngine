It began on December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China and has spread to most countries of the world. WHO declared it as pandemic on 11 March 2020 and advised all countries to take urgent and aggressive actions to control its spread.1 At the time of writing this review, 22 March 2020, there were 338,850 infected cases and more than 14.400 deaths.2 Figures that continue to rise substantially among the last few days threatening a global pandemic crisis with great sequalae. In this article, we provide a brief review for Orthopedic surgeons as regard COVID-19 virus microbiology, epidemiology, clinical picture, and diagnosis. Moreover, what measures should be taken amid this pandemic to assess its control, maintain the urgent duties, and protect health care workers (HCW) are also discussed.",

A council of Orthopedic experts in different subspecialties are organized to assess the cases needed exception and decided who can't be postponed on individual basis. However, in analyzing the risk and benefit of any planned procedure, not only the clinical situation must be evaluated, but resource conservation also should be considered.22\n",
