Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However, clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive.",

With spreading of the disease, there here have been described new clinical features of the disease, such as neurological, myocardial, ophtalmic, cutaneous or thrombotic events. When coronavirus invades the host, a complex intracellular mechanism is activated, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) is promoted. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates alveolar cell (pneumocytes type II) using the receptor for angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a membrane exopeptidase. Activating the downstream JAK STAT signal-pathway, IFNs limit virus spread, and play an immunomodulatory role through macrophage, NK cells and T/B cells. Blocking the production of IFNs allows virus to survive (6) . On the other hand, coronavirus infection activates the immune system generating an excessive response that could lead to greater lung injury and worse clinical evolution.

Most patients in both treatment groups were receiving other potentially effective drugs, as hydroxychloroquine or azytromycin, making it difficult to demonstrate efficacy of a treatment individually in a retrospective analysis. Results from in vitro and animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b21b may be effective against MERS-CoV. A randomized controlled trial is ongoing to evaluate this combination as a potential treatment for MERS (MIRACLE trial) (20). To explore the efficacy of this combination in SARS-CoV-2, we compare in-hospital mortality between patients receiving interferon beta1b with and without lopinavir/ritonavir and no difference in in-hospital mortality was found.",

Although treatment with interferon was indicated in moderatesevere pneumonia, there was a shortage of the drug, so not all patients could receive treatment despite being indicated.
