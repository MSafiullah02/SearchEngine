            "text": "Groups of enterprises guarantee each other and form complex guarantee networks when they try to obtain loans from banks. Such secured loan can enhance the solvency and promote the rapid growth in the economic upturn period. However, potential systemic risk may happen within the risk binding community. Especially, during the economic down period, the crisis may spread in the guarantee network like a domino. Monitoring the financial status, preventing or reducing systematic risk when crisis happens is highly concerned by the regulatory commission and banks. We propose visual analytics approach for loan guarantee network risk management, and consolidate the five analysis tasks with financial experts: i) visual analytics for enterprises default risk, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and developed an interface to visualize key indicators; ii) visual analytics for high default groups, whereby a community detection based interactive approach is presented; iii) visual analytics for high defaults pattern, whereby a motif detection based interactive approach is described, and we adopt a Shneiderman Mantra strategy to reduce the computation complexity. iv) visual analytics for evolving guarantee network, whereby animation is used to help understanding the guarantee dynamic; v) visual analytics approach and interface for default diffusion path. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the government and bank to monitor the default spread status. It also provides insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systemic financial risk. We implement the system with case studies on a realworld guarantee network. Two financial experts are consulted with endorsement on the developed tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual analytics tool to explore the guarantee network risks in a systematic manner.",

The majority of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are difficult to get loan from the banks for their limited credit qualification, thus they often need to seek loan guarantees. In fact, guaranteed loan is already an important way to raise money in addition with seeking listed. In some developed economy like in US and UK, special government backed banks are established to provide guarantee credit [22, 27, 30, 40, 55] ; While in emerging economies like Korea [19] and China [31] , it is more common that the corporations guarantee each other when they are trying to secure loans from lending institutions. It is reported that a quarter of the $13 trillion in total outstanding loans in China are guaranteed loans in 2014 [40] and there is an 18% year-to-year increase [36] . This has led to a noticeable new phenomenon: a large amount of corporations back each other and form complex guarantee networks.",

More recently, [4] presents an in-depth analysis on how to interpret and visualize the learned knowledge embedded in the neural networks using explanatory rules. The authors in [32] combine debt-to-income ratio with consumer banking transactions, and use a linear regression model with timewindowed data set to predict the default rates in a short future.

Networks or graph is a natural representation of the financial systems as they often bear complex interdependence and connections inside [2] . The relationship between network structure and financial system risk are carefully studied and several insights have been drawn: network structure has few impact for system welfare but plays an important role in determining systemic risk and welfare in short-term debt [3] . After the 2008 global financial crisis, network theory attracts more attention: the crisis brought by Lehman Brothers spreads on connected corporations in a similar infectious way as the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 -both are small damage that hits a networked system and causes serious events [8, 13] . The journal of Nature Physics organizes a special on how to understand some fundamental economic issues using network theory [1] . These publications suggest the applicability of network based financial model. For example, the dynamic network produced by bank overnight funds loan may be an alert of the crisis [13] . Contrary to the conventional stereotype that large institutions are \"too big to fail\", the truth is the position of the institution in the network is equally and sometimes more important than its size [6] . More central the vertex is to the graph, more influential it is to the whole economic network when default occurs [13] . Moreover, the research that aims to understand individual behavior and interactions in the social network, has also attracted extensive attention [7, 20, 46, 47, 61, 62, 67] . Although preliminary efforts have been made using network theory to understand fundamental problems in financial systems [12, 17, 64] , there is little work on the system risk analysis in the loan guarantee network except for the preliminary work [41] . Among them, may be the most important work is using K-shell decomposition to predict the default rate; positive correlation between the K-Shell decomposition value of the network and default rates was reported [41] .",

Classic anomalous and significant subgraphs refer to subgraphs, in which the behaviors (attributes) of the nodes or edges are significantly different from the behaviors of those outside the subgraphs [48] . Anomalous and significant subgraphs in social network can be used for early detection of emerging events such as civil unrest prediction, rare disease outbreak detection, and early detection of human rights events. The heterogeneous social network is modeled as a sensor network in which each node senses its local neighborhood, computes multiple features, and reports the overall degree of anomalousness. P-values of the subgraphs are used to represent the significance, and iterative subgraph expansion are used for the scaling problem [15] . Emerging events such as crimes or disease cases are detected from Spatial Networks [34, 44] . A common challenge for the subgraph detection is the complexity. As many of the algorithms are turned into subgraph isomorphism problem which is N-P complete problem, it is computationally infeasible for naive search. Algorithms are designed to optimize the performance. Readers are referred to [43, 58, 59, 68] for more details.",

In order to build a highly representative feature which can reliably reflect the statistical relationships between the customers information and their repayment ability, we clean the data and construct the features as: Basic Profile, the essential company registration information, which reflects the character, capital, collateral, capability, condition and stability [41] . We use business nature, registered capital, enterprise scale, employee number and others as corporation's basic profile. Most banks require company to update the basic information when the enterprise makes a loan application, and we choose to use the latest information as the basic profile features of the loan. Credit Behavior, historical behavior e.g. credit history, default records, default amount, total loan amount and loan count, total loan frequency (if any), total default rates. They are calculated by all the loan records before the active loan contract. Active Loan, the loan contract in its execution period. It contains active loan amount, active loan times, type of capital return and interest return etc. Network Structure, network features such as centralities are extracted as NS. Note that as discussed above, the basic profile may be not completely trustworthy as the SMEs may provide out of date or even fake information to the bank.

Sophisticated guarantee relationships tend to cause credit granted by multiple lenders and excessive credit. In the loan guarantee, a guarantor has the debt obligation if the borrower defaults, if the guarantee could not payback to the back, it may resort to its guarantors. In this case, the default may propagate like virus.The default contagious increases the possibility of occurrence of risks and transmission of risks. Especially in the economic downturn, some enterprises face operation difficulties and the financial crisis will have a domino effect: the default phenomenon may spread rapidly in the network, and this will make a large number of enterprises fall into unfavorable situation. The government and the banks always wish to monitor the default spread status and understand the complexity of the current issue of risks before they can take precautionary measures, conduct research, and take effective measures to prevent and dissolve risks, to ensure that no regional or systemic financial risk occur.",

(a) is a guarantee network with eight nodes, where node E provides guarantee to five adjacent nodes and C, D provide guarantee to B and then to A; (b) is the possible diffusion path, the default of node A may lead to the B, C, D even E default. It is noted that node G, F, H are not connected with node E, as the default of E will not affect the repayment status of G,F, and H. In practice, there may be multiple possible propagation path as each node can serve as guarantor or get guaranteed. It is difficult to outline the main propagation path from the entire. We make the following assumption: the node on multiple propagation pathes is the key to prevent large scale default diffusion and thus should be highlighted. We compute all the propagation pathes, count occurrences and highlight the node on the network. We use the color to illustrate the propagation risk importance.",

The factors include the financial information of the corporation and guarantee contract amount information. The former information is plain listed when the user hovers the mouse pointer on the node, while a sankey diagram is used to represent the guarantee flow. The widths of the sankey diagram bands are directly proportional to the guarantee amount. Fig. 12 (a) gives results on a real guarantee network, when we choose one node, for example, node 32, the whole potential propagation path is highlighted in (b), and (c) is the corresponding sankey diagram. It can be seen that upstream companies usually provides more guarantee than they received. For example, node 18 provides much more guarantee than it receives. The imbalance of guarantee amount and collateral amount provide clue for the credit line assessment. The real situation is even much more complex. The default may be diffused like a virus infection and the virion must identify and bind to its receptor (guarantor). As mentioned earlier, each enterprises has more than 3000 financial entries, it is difficult to quantify anti-infective ability for each enterprises. We enable users to look up multiple financial status and cut off the propagation path. We also note that the propagation model provides more insights to end users and we plan to perform in-depth study for the topic and provide simulation interface in the future.",

This is consistent with intuition -the enterprise works as the hub ones back a large number of other corporations and it is supposed to be relatively stable and operates in good condition. In contrast, the enterprise works as the authority ones and accepts guarantee from many other corporations and this means they lack funds security and have higher risk in trouble.
