It provides a review of Taiwan's bidding strategies for the World Health Organization between 1997 and 2009. The country's participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and the International Health Regulations (IHR) network since 2009 was a significant improvement, but this experience failed to extend to other governing bodies. The chapter goes on to discuss the global public health risk of excluding Taiwan from cross-national health cooperation, and why such a conundrum remains difficult to resolve. Taiwan's compliance regarding health governance relies heavily on self-regulation and the help of its allies. The United States has played a key role in enforcing global health regulations on Taiwan. Unlike other sources of threat in health governance, Taiwan currently does not represent a high health risk to other countries. As a result, Taiwan finds it difficult to persuade WHO members to manifest \"universal participation\" by including Taiwan in various intergovernmental health networks. This pattern of governance, however, lacks transparency. Other countries will find it difficult to monitor or intervene in the event Taiwan's health authority is unable to deal with a transnational health emergency.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "After Chiang was defeated in the Chinese civil war and retreated to Taiwan, the ROC government maintained its membership for more than two decades. Under the aid and programs directed by WHO, Taiwan gradually improved its primary healthcare system. This connection was cut off when the Taiwanese government lost its UN seat to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1971 under UN resolution No. 2758 . In the following year, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the main decision body of WHO, passed Resolution 25.1. In this Resolution, PRC also restored its rights as the representative of China in WHO. Taiwan's formal communication with the organization stopped. Taiwanese health officials interacted with WHO through indirect means, usually bridged by unofficial channels. 1 As the Cold War ended, Taiwan sought to return to the UN and its specialized agencies in 1993. The WHO bidding was first suggested by the public. There were many unofficial activities pushing for Taiwan's return to WHO before the Taiwanese government took the initiative. The most significant example was the efforts made by the Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan (FMPAT). FMPAT held lobbies for Taiwan's representation in WHO since 1995. 2 These efforts initially received a cold response from the Taiwanese government.

Specifically, Taiwan's effort focused on joining the World Health Assembly (WHA), the ministerial intergovernmental meeting held every year in May. Taiwan did not apply for WHO membership because WHA Resolution 25.1 rejected Taiwan's legal status as a state. Taiwan would face the same sovereignty problem in the UN bidding if it attempted to overrule the WHA Resolution. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to successfully obtain a WHO membership. And there was no observer status in WHO. However, the WHA received observers. The WHO Constitution and Rule of Procedure of the WHA regulated an observer status that left a grey area for Taiwan. Under article three of the Rule, Taiwan might participate in the WHA under an invitation from WHO Director-General (DG) without being officially recognized as state or territory. In practice, WHA observers included a variety of sovereignty statuses. They included internationally recognized states like the Holy See, selfgoverning territories like Palestine, and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The rules offered Taiwan an opportunity to participate in the WHA without clarifying its legal status. Therefore, being a WHA observer was an opportunity to participate in intergovernmental governance that was not available in other intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). This made the WHA bid a primary target for Taiwan's foreign policy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Republic of China (ROC) government was the founding member of WHO in 1948."}, {"text": "Since its withdrawal from the UN and its specialized agencies, Taiwan was excluded from rules and institutions that became increasingly important in global governance. In terms of health governance, WHO had become the main body where states formulated and enforced health-related regulations (Frenk and Moon 2013) . Global health governance focuses on transnational health risk, such as the spread of infectious diseases, border control and examination, food safety, and joint research and laboratory standards on examinations and treatments. In practice, WHO health governance consists of various networks or regulations, including International Health Regulations (IHR), the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), and the International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT). WHO contains the negative externalities of transnational health threats by providing public goods or medical services sponsored by developed countries. The networks it established since the end of Cold War allow health policy makers to exchange health information. They create professional cooperation among professional medical experts. WHO members regularly convene to review the progress of WHO projects. This makes WHO an effective monitoring power in global health governance. Although non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also important contributors to global health, their governing power and ability to build networks between national health authorities cannot match the scale of WHO. 3 Taiwan was not required to implement rules established among WHO members, but it maintained good records of compliance. Instead of being a deserter of global health regulations, Taiwan showed great interest in conforming to the decisions made in the health governing bodies. Its compliance was grounded in two reasons. The first one was voluntary implementation. Taiwan voluntarily conformed to health-related rules and standards for two reasons. First, it wanted to improve its own health governance by \"catching up\" to the global standards. These rules created short cuts for health policy formulation or provided reference for law-making in Taiwan. For example, the Taiwanese government voluntarily enforced the guidelines made by FCTC. Taiwan's tobacco control policy depends on the recommendations and research reports developed under FCTC conferences. Secondly, from Taiwan's perspective, its voluntary participation demonstrated the country's resolution to join intergovernmental health bodies such as the WHA and FCTC Convention of Parties. Taiwan's compliance echoed the government's foreign policy, showing that Taiwan was willing to take its part in global health governance. As a result, Taiwan's exclusion made its health authority more willing to implement international standards.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 313, "text": "(Frenk and Moon 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1564, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Republic of China (ROC) government was the founding member of WHO in 1948."}, {"text": "The second reason underlying Taiwan's compliance was the support/pressure from its allies, mainly the US. The US health administration maintained very close relations with its Taiwanese counterpart. The Centers for Disease Control in the two countries, for example, regularly exchanged information. The US usually provided consultations that facilitated the work of Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Taiwan gained the latest information about WHO activities from the US representatives who took part in WHO. Taiwan's diplomatic allies also create professional channels that connected Taiwan's internal health governance with the global one. In addition to being privy to information concerning intergovernmental meetings, Taiwanese health officials attended intergovernmental meetings by joining the delegations of its diplomatic allies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Republic of China (ROC) government was the founding member of WHO in 1948."}, {"text": "The discussion above shows that Taiwan's participation in global health governance is not entirely isolated. 4 Taiwan closely follows the progress of global health governance, though such involvement is quite limited. And Taiwan's representatives are absent in almost every intergovernmental meetings. Therefore, the Taiwanese 3 To be sure, NGOs are also important advocates of global health governance. Organizations such as Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Gates Foundation have done significant works in the area of health, and they have maintained partnership with WHO. Their programs build up local infrastructure and improve public health. Sometimes WHO relies on their help to provide health aid. However, they rarely establish cross-national networks of cooperation and information sharing. For more on NGOs' role in global health governance, see for example (Brown 2010; Buse and Harmer 2007; Dodgson et al. 2002; Frenk and Moon 2013; The Lancet Editorial 2009; Rushton and Williams 2011). 4 It should be noted that Taiwan has a vibrant civil society. NGOs based in Taiwan have provided medical assistance and undertaken charity work in different parts of the world. These efforts are part of global health governance. For example, Rollet (2005) discusses the work several Taiwanese NGOs have done in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. government adopts indirect channels to acquire information regarding WHO activities. The most significant problem of Taiwan's current mode of participation is efficiency. The lack of a direct communication channel between Taiwan and the governing body creates an information gap. Taiwan cannot obtain the latest information released by WHO, neither can WHO obtain the latest health information inside Taiwan. Taiwan has no obligation to report its health information to WHO, and WHO will not request information from the Taiwanese government. According to the UN resolution, China is responsible for Taiwan's internal affairs, but in reality Beijing does not administer Taiwan's health affairs and therefore it is unable to report health figures regarding Taiwan. Even if the Taiwanese government voluntarily report its health figure to WHO, WHO might not accept because of the political dispute.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 938, "end": 950, "text": "(Brown 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 951, "end": 972, "text": "Buse and Harmer 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 973, "end": 993, "text": "Dodgson et al. 2002;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 994, "end": 1014, "text": "Frenk and Moon 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1041, "text": "The Lancet Editorial 2009;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1071, "text": "Rushton and Williams 2011). 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1325, "text": "Rollet (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Republic of China (ROC) government was the founding member of WHO in 1948."}, {"text": "This becomes a problem when it comes to the spread of infectious diseases and food security.

Once Taiwan fails to contain a health risk, WHO cannot intervene, nor can it provide assistance to prevent further spread of the health risk. Information concerning a local health risk only passes through bilateral communication channels between Taiwan and its neighboring states.

Between 1997 and 2008, Taiwan mobilized all its diplomatic relationships to participate in WHO, mostly aimed at attending the WHA. It rallied its diplomatic allies, lobbied foreign governments and their congresses, organized NGO support, and directed media attention to its bids. These activities aimed to raise issue salience and earn international support to fight against China's diplomatic blockade. Every year immediately after the WHA in May, the Taiwanese government began a new round of bidding. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Department of Health (DOH, now the Ministry of Health and Welfare) jointly set up main tactics for the next year. They mobilized overseas Foreign Service offices, produced media propaganda, and organized a series of conferences and activities. Government officials regularly established connections with important INGO leaders, foreign government officers, foreign congressmen, and even WHO officers. The Taiwanese government wanted to rally enough support from the international community to outweigh China and its allies. The following table shows Taiwan's bids from 1997 to 2016 (Table 1) In 1997, Taiwan's first attempt to return to the WHA met with a cold response from the international community. China responded furiously as expected. It claimed that Taiwan is not an independent state under the \"One China Principle\" and therefore did not qualify to participate in the WHA (Li 2008) . Over time, Taiwan accumulated support from the international community. Besides its diplomatic allies, Taiwan gained support from the US government in 2001, and later in 2003, the Japanese government announced its support. Taiwan also gained support from professional INGOs. For example, the World Medical Association (WMA) has been a reliable ally. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) and International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) also publicly supported Taiwan. 5 Taiwan obtained much attention from international society.

In terms of number of cases and death toll, Taiwan ranked third among all countries during the outbreak.

The improvement of the cross-Strait relationship gave the Taiwanese government leverage to pressure Beijing through domestic politics. Under the doctrine of diplomatic truce, the government claimed in public that engaging China, rather than clashing with it, would bring more international space for Taiwan. This claim tied the hands of Ma's government (Fearon 1997) , and the WHA bidding played a key role. The public held high expectations that China would lower its diplomatic barrier and help Taiwan's WHA accession. The failure of the WHA bidding would have resulted in a credibility crisis for Ma's foreign policy. The \"diplomatic truce\" might have collapsed, and Ma's cross-Strait policy would have drowned with it. It would have decreased Ma's support, shaken the KMT government, and forced Mr. Ma to reconsider his Mainland policy. China would not welcome this development. China preferred KMT to remain in office rather than the DPP; it also preferred Ma's Mainland policy to his predecessor's. Moreover, the domestic criticism in Taiwan further strengthened the \"tying hands\" effect. The greater the domestic pressure on the WHA issue in Taiwanese politics, the more audience cost Ma had to suffer if the WHA bidding did not work out. China recognized that the domestic audience cost for the Taiwanese government would be high if there was no substantive outcome for Taiwan's WHA bidding. As a result, it made a mutually acceptable arrangement for Taiwan's observership. And it made sure that Taiwan was satisfied with the arrangement so Ma's government could demonstrate the effectiveness of \"diplomatic truce\" to its people.
