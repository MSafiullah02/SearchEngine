            "text": "On 23 March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on a new outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection which began in December 2013 in the Republic of Guinea, initially in the Prefecture of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou [1], and which would shortly thereafter spread to other West African countries, viz. Sierra Leone and Liberia. The number of cases reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone for the period of January\u2013September 2014 (Fig. 1\n) [2] give little indication that the incidence of EBOV infection has begun to decline [3]. According to the WHO the EBOV epidemic is still growing and the doubling time was estimated 15.7 days in Guinea, 23.6 days in Liberia and 30.2 days in Sierra Leone [2]. EBOV infection is a severe hemorrhagic fever caused by the negative-stranded, non-segmented RNA virus belonging to the genus Ebolavirus (family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales). The second genus in this family is Marburgvirus, causing a similar disease to EBOV infection; the third genus, Cuevavirus (prototype: Cueva del Lloviu) [4], is confined to bat hosts. Bats, and in particular the fruit bat, Myonycteris torquata, seem to be the leading suspect as the reservoir of Ebola virus infections, but the bats do not seem to get sick from the virus [5]. Humans, however, present with fever, headache, joint muscle and abdominal pain accompanied by diarrhea and vomiting after a highly variable incubation period of 1\u201325 days; in this stage, EBOV infection could be easily confused with other tropical fevers such as malaria or dengue, until the appearance of the hemorrhagic terminal phase presenting with the characteristic internal and subcutaneous bleedings [6]. To date treatment against EBOV infection is mostly asymptomatic and consists of rehydration, stabilization of blood pressure and control of fever and pain.",

EBOV-Z and EBOV-S are the predominant EBOVs associated with known outbreaks, and are more pathogenic than EBOV-R, which has caused fatal infection only in non-human primates, and EBOV-TF, which has only caused a single non-fatal human infection [7]. EBOV-Z, EBOV-S and EBOV-B have often caused severe hemorrhagic disease with markedly high case fatality rates (40\u201390%) (Table 1\n) [8]. EBOV has been classified as a BSL4 (biosafety level 4) agent or Category A potential bioterrorism agent, by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention. It was first described in 1976 [9].",

The viral RNA genome encodes seven proteins: NP (nucleoprotein), VP35 (polymerase cofactor), VP40 (matrix protein), GP (glycoprotein), VP30 (transcription activator), VP24 (secondary matrix protein), and L (\u201cLarge\u201d), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [6].

            "text": "Therapeutic strategies against EBOV infection can be classified into different categories according to their target of action: (i) recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2) [12] and recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC), which are aimed at treating clinical symptoms of coagulopathy and sepsis, respectively, which are observed in infected patients but not specific for EBOV infection; (ii) small, interfering RNAs (siRNAs) such as the positively charged phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO plus) and (iii) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to suppress viremia and virus spread [13]. PMO plus antisense therapies have been shown to protect > 60% of rhesus monkeys against EBOV-Z and 100% of cynomolgus monkeys against Marburg virus infection [14], and the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of PMO plus (AVI-6002, AVI-6003) have been further documented [15]. The PMO AVI-6002 is composed of AVI-7537 and AVI-7539 and AVI-6003 is composed of AVI-7287 and AVI-7288. AVI-7537 targets the VP24 gene of EBOV and AVI-7288 targets the NP gene of Marburg virus. They are now progressing to the late stage of clinical development [16]. Meanwhile, the potential of siRNAs as a postexposure treatment strategy for people infected with EBV has been convincingly demonstrated [17]. Post-exposure antibody prophylaxis has been shown to protect nonhuman primates (NHPs) from filovirus (either Marburg or Ebola virus) infections, even when delayed for 48 hours [18]. The reversion of advanced EBOV infection in nonhuman primates with ZMapp (100% protection of rhesus macaques) [19] has had such an impact that ethical considerations have trespassed the demand for the material [20].",

            "text": "The time to deploy Ebola vaccines has now come [21]. Viable Ebola vaccine candidates are rVSV (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus) + EBOV-Z-GP (glycoprotein), rRABV (recombinant rabies virus) + EBOV-Z-GP, rAd5 (recombinant adenovirus serotype 5) + EBOV-Z-GP, VLP (virus-like particles) + EBOV-Z-GP, rHPIV3 (recombinant human parainfluenza virus type 3) + EBOV-Z-GP, rCMV (recombinant cytomegalovirus) + EBOV-Z-NP (nucleoprotein) and rEBOV (recombinant Ebola virus) subunit vaccine + TLR (toll-like receptor) agonist [21]. That it would be feasible to develop a preventive vaccine against Ebola virus infection in primates, i.e. cynomolgus macaques, was already demonstrated in 2000 by Nabel and his co-workers [22]. VLPs have subsequently been shown to protect nonhuman primates against a lethal Ebola virus challenge [23]; VSV-based vaccines expressing the EBOV-Z glycoprotein completely protect cynomolgus macaques against an aerosol challenge of EBOV-Z [24]. Complete protection in cynomolgus macaques against Bundibugyo Ebola virus challenge was also achieved with a VSV-based vaccine [25]. A single intramuscular vaccination with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replicon particle (VRP) expressing EBOV-S-GP combined with VRP expressing EBOV GP provided complete protection against intramuscular challenge with either EBOV-S or EBOV-Z in cynomolgus macaques [26]. Antibodies play a critical role in rVSV- EBOV-Z-GP-mediated protection against a lethal EBOV-Z challenge in cynomolgus macaques [27]. A highly immunogenic fragment [MFL (aa 393\u2013556)] has been derived from EBOV-Z-GP that elicits high levels of neutralizing antibody in mice [28]. And a VLP vaccine would hold great potential in the fight against wild ape extinction, as it could be used for vaccinating captive chimpanzees to protect wild chimpanzees [29]. While several phase I vaccination clinical trials are in progress or about to start, it is not expected to get any vaccine commercially available before the end of 2015.",

Yet, interferon has for the last decade, been part, together with ribavirin, of the standard of care (SOC) in the treatment of hepatitis C [31], [32], [33]. Whenever a new virus emerges (or re-emerges), however, so does the potential use of interferon. This was the case, in 2003, at the outbreak of the SARS coronavirus epidemic [34], and now is interferon envisaged again for the therapy of EBOV infections [35]. From a practical viewpoint, the potential use of (pegylated) interferon in the treatment of EBOV infections should be facilitated by its increased availability now that its usefulness in the treatment of hepatitis C will be overtaken by the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). In addition, interferons could induce a number of IFITMs (interferon-induced transmembrane proteins), which exert antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses, including not only HIV-1, HCV, SARS coronavirus, but also VSV, EBOV, Marburg and West Nile virus and, possibly, other viruses which could considerably extend the scope for interferon-based therapy [36], [37].",

[38] is that 3-deazaneplanocin A, an S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase inhibitor [40] could induce massively increased interferon-\u03b1 production in EBOV-infected mice. Whether this massive interferon production was only epiphenomenal or causally related to the protective effect of 3-deazaneplanocin A against Ebola has never been resolved. Nor has been the reason for the induction of the massive interferon induction by 3-deazaneplanocin A. A possible hypothesis is that 3-deazaneplanocin, being a SAH hydrolase inhibitor, blocks the methylation of the (+)RNA transcribed from the (\u2212)RNA filovirus genome, thus preventing the release of the mRNA from the (\u2212)RNA\u00b7(+)RNA duplex and generating increased levels of double-stranded (ds)RNA molecules which then act as powerful inducers of interferon. SAH hydrolase inhibitors may specifically block the capping (ribose 2\u2032-O-methylation) of viral mRNAs, as it may provide a molecular signature for the distinction of self from non-self mRNA dependent on the RNA sensor Mda5 [41]. In addition to the natural neplanocin A, B, C, D and F, the enantiomers of 1\u2032,6\u2032-isomer of neplanocin A have been synthesized (Fig. 3\n) [42], but their potential for in vivo therapy of EBOV infections remains to be assessed.",

Even more importantly, its potential activity against the rhabdovirus VSV was not even touched upon, although much has to be learned for filovirus therapeutics from their action against rhabdoviruses (such as VSV), especially with regard to their mode of action at the RNA polymerase level. BCX4430 can be considered as an adenosine analog with 2 structural modifications: (i) it is a C-nucleoside instead of the usual N-glycoside, and (ii) the 1,4-oxygen has been replaced by a 1,4-imino group. The original compound synthesized in this series was BCX-1777 (Fig. 4), the hypoxanthine derivative of BCX4430 [45]. BCX-1777 was reported as a purine nucleoside phosphorylase transition-state inhibitor. No antiviral activity was reported for BCX-1777.

Hence, it is not surprising that it is also active against the filoviridae, in casu EBOV [48], [49]. Structurally, favipiravir is closely related to ribavirin (Fig. 5\n), with which it shares a carboxamide (C\u2013(O)\u2013NH2) moiety. Perhaps, favipiravir could be considered as a more specific antiviral version of ribavirin; they are both targeted at the viral RNA polymerase, although ribavirin is principally targeted at the IMP dehydrogenase [50]. To be converted to its active metabolite, acting at the viral RNA polymerase, favipiravir should first be converted to its phosphoribosyl derivative and subsequently to the triphosphate (Fig. 6\n) before it could interact as a RNA polymerase inhibitor, principally in direct competition with GTP. Again, it should be mentioned that VSV would serve as an adequate surrogate virus to judge the potential of favipiravir in the treatment of EBOV infections. An in vivo animal model for VSV infection in newborn mice has been described many years ago [51].",

            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) was first identified as a hemorrhagic fever virus in 1976, that is 5 years before AIDS was recognized, and 7 years before HIV was discovered as its etiologic agent. EBOV has regularly led to the emergence of epidemics, particularly in Congo (Zaire), Sudan and Uganda, but it only recently stirred up worldwide concern with its breakthrough in West Africa. This started in December 2013, has spread over three countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and with a mortality rate of up to 90%, it has reached a global death toll of about 5000 (and still rising). There is still no vaccine or treatment available, although EBOV, while highly contagious, is very sensitive to varying well-defined compounds. The majority of these compounds (Table 2\n) are targeted at either viral entry or virus replication/transcription. To work with EBOV, BSL 4 (Biosafety level 4, the highest level) is required, which makes that EBOV can only be handled in very few laboratories over the world. It should be pointed out, however, that the mechanism of replication of EBOV, which belongs to the filoviridae, follows a strategy that is similar to that of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which belongs to the rhabdoviridae. In this sense, VSV could be considered as a surrogate virus for EBOV. This means that several compounds that were previously described as inhibitors of VSV should be revisited as therapeutic agents for EBOV, and, vice versa, potential anti-EBOV therapies could be pre-evaluated for their anti-VSV activity. This is most pertinent for compounds, such as neplanocin A derivatives, that are targeted at the S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, or favipiravir, which is targeted at the viral RNA polymerase.",
