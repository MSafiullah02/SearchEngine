To investigate the development and sites of residence of intestinal memory B cells, and their role in protective immunity to reinfection with an enteric virus, we assessed the association between memory B cell and antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses and protection using a gnotobiotic pig model for human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhoea. The isotypes, quantities and tissue distribution of rotavirus-speci\u00aec memory B cells and ASC were evaluated prechallenge (28 and 83 postinoculation days [PID]) and postchallenge (7 postchallenge days [PCD]), using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated once with virulent or three times with attenuated HRV and challenged at PID 28 with the corresponding virulent HRV. Complete protection against HRV shedding and diarrhoea was associated with signi\u00aecantly higher numbers of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) memory B cells and ASC in the ileum of virulent HRV-inoculated pigs at challenge. In contrast, pigs inoculated with attenuated HRV had lower numbers of IgA and IgG memory B cells and ASC in intestinal lymphoid tissues, but higher numbers in the spleen. The bone marrow had the lowest mean numbers of IgA and IgG memory B cells and ASC prechallenge in both groups of HRV-inoculated pigs. Therefore, bone marrow was not a site for IgA and IgG rotavirus-speci\u00aec antibody production or for memory B cells after inoculation with live rotavirus, from 28 PID up to at least 83 PID. The effect of in vitro antigen dose was examined and it was determined to play an important role in the development of ASC from memory B cells for the different tissues examined.",

However, the number of immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASC in systemic lymphoid tissues does not correlate with protection. 3, 4 The majority of speci\u00aec IgA ASC at mucosal surfaces induced by primary exposure to intestinal virus infection are short-lived, with a life span, in general, of a few days. 5\u00b17 Therefore, the number of long-lived plasma cells and virus-speci\u00aec memory B cells induced by primary antigen exposure play important roles in protection against reinfection. 8, 9 Long-lived plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells and do not proliferate upon exposure to recall antigen. The cells persist without the requirement for antigen presence and secrete antibodies continually in the secondary lymphoid organs where the cells reside. In contrast, memory B cells do not secrete antibodies spontaneously. When activated by recall antigen, memory B cells differentiate rapidly into ASC and secrete greater quantities of antibodies with higher af\u00aenity compared to na\u00f5 \u00c8ve B cells. 8, 10, 11 Memory B cells differ from naive B cells in several ways (which may also be related to their role in conferring protection) including: ' lower requirements for activation (from antigen, cytokine",

Williams 14 et al. reported that at 3\u00b15 weeks after oral inoculation of adult mice twice with the EC strain of murine rotavirus, the majority of rotavirus-speci\u00aec IgA and IgG ASC and memory B cells were localized in the intestinal lymphoid tissues, with much fewer numbers of IgA ASC and memory B cells in bone marrow. The bone marrow was suggested to be one of the major sites for long-term antibody production. 14 In mice, after a single rotavirus infection, high titres of rotavirus-speci\u00aec antibodies persist and the mice are protected from reinfection for life. This life-long immunity is not observed after rotavirus infections in humans, who continue to be susceptible to reinfection with rotavirus, but such reinfections usually occur as subclinical infections after subsequent re-exposure. 15 In humans, reinfections with the same serotype of rotavirus also occur. Lack of long-term immunity to rotavirus raises the question as to the role of memory B cells in protective immunity to rotavirus infections in humans. To help address this question, we studied memory B-cell responses to HRV in a gnotobiotic pig model of HRV infection and disease. 16 The gnotobiotic pig is a unique model for the study of immunity to HRV induced by natural infection and by rotavirus vaccines, because the pathogenesis and immunity of rotavirus infections in pigs and humans are similar, but differ from the subclinical infections and life-long immunity produced in adult mice. 15\u00b117 In addition, the gastrointestinal physiology and the development of a mucosal immune response by gnotobiotic pigs closely resemble those of human infants.

Mononuclear cells (MNC) from the lymphoid tissues were isolated as previously described. 3, 4 Bone marrow was collected from the femurs of pigs by\u00afushing the bone marrow cavity with 5 ml of Ca 2+ -and Mg 2+ -free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco BRL). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by passing the Hanks' balanced salt solution\u00b1 bone marrow suspension through stainless steel 80-mesh screens of a cell collector (Cellecter; E-C Apparatus Corp., St. Petersburg, FL). The MNC were isolated from bone marrow by Ficoll\u00b1Hypaque (Ficoll-Paque 1 . 077; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) density-gradient centrifugation, similar to the isolation procedure used for MNC from peripheral blood. 3 The puri\u00aeed MNC from all tissues were resuspended in complete medium consisting of RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethyl-piperazine-Nk-2-ethanesulphonic acid), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0 . 1 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 mg/ml of gentamicin, 10 mg/ml of ampicillin and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (E-RPMI).",

The ELISPOT assay performed on the day of MNC extraction was used to determine the numbers of in vivo antigen-activated ASC (e.g. plasma cells), because plasma cells secrete antibody spontaneously. The ELISPOT assays performed after the MNC were stimulated with rotavirus or mock antigen in cell culture for 5 days were used to determine the numbers of memory B cells. Memory B cells were identi\u00aeed on the basis of their ability to proliferate, differentiate and secrete antibody upon stimulation with the recall Wa HRV antigen. 26 Brie\u00afy, the concentrations of viable MNC recovered from cell culture were adjusted to 5r10 6 /ml (3 . 5r10 6 MNC in 0 . 7 ml of ERPMI). When fewer than 3 . 5r10 6 viable MNC were harvested, the existing number of MNC were used in the assays. Wa HRV-infected, \u00aexed-cell plates were washed \u00aeve times with distilled water prior to use. Single-cell suspensions of MNC from each tissue were added to duplicate wells with 5r10 5 , 5r10 4 and 5r10 3 MNC/well for the ELISPOT assay. The plates were incubated for <12 hr at 37u in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere and then washed and incubated with biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) (puri\u00aeed ascites\u00afuids) to pig IgG (derived from hybridoma 3H7, 0 . 03 mg/ml), pig IgA (derived from hybridoma 6D11, 0 . 04 mg/ml), or pig IgM (derived from hybridoma 5C9, 0 . 35 mg/ml), 27 for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were washed and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated streptavidin (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was added (diluted 1 : 30 000). After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, the plates were washed and blue spots were developed with tetramethylbenzidine and the H 2 O 2 peroxidase substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). The numbers of virus-speci\u00aec ASC were determined by counting blue spots in the wells and reported as the number of virus-speci\u00aec ASC per 5r10 5 MNC. Because of the low viability of MNC from some of the tissues, the number of memory B cells from the tissues with fewer than 3 . 5r10 6 viable MNC were adjusted according to the viable MNC numbers at the time the in vitro ELISPOT assays were performed to compensate, and to enable comparison, of the memory B-cell responses among tissues. In this case, the numbers of memory B cells were calculated as: ASCr(5r10 5 }numbers of viable MNC).",

The lower numbers of IgA and IgG ASC detected in all tissues of this group of pigs on PID 28 (PCD 0) re\u00afect the lower antigenicity of the attenuated Wa HRV; virulent Wa HRV is known to replicate more extensively than attenuated Wa HRV throughout the small intestine. 19 However, high numbers of IgG memory B cells detected in the spleen after inoculation with attenuated Wa HRV indicate that naive B cells in systemic lymphoid tissues were primed by the viral antigen. The original site of priming of the memory B cells detected in the systemic lymphoid tissues was not determined in this study. They could be nai \u00c8 ve B cells activated in situ in the systemic lymphoid tissues, or B cells primed in the intestines that then migrated into the spleen and resided there. The systemic IgG memory B-cell responses and the low numbers of intestinal IgA and IgG ASC were associated with only partial protection of these pigs when challenged on PID 28. This observation agrees with our previous \u00aendings for pigs inoculated intramuscularly with inactivated Wa HRV 4 or inoculated intranasally with 2/6-virus-like particles, 17 in which high numbers of IgG ASC and memory B cells were induced in the systemic lymphoid tissues. However, minimal or no protection was conferred by inoculation with the inactivated Wa HRV or 2/6 virus-like particles. These \u00aendings re-emphasize our theory that protection against an enteric virus infection is dependent not only on the magnitude, but also on the site and isotype, of the ASC and memory B-cell responses. 3, 4, 17 Predominant IgA ASC responses were detected in the duodenum of virulent Wa HRV-inoculated pigs; however, the majority of the virus-speci\u00aec IgA memory B cells were resident in the ileum, not the duodenum. In pigs, as in humans, the duodenal lymphoid tissue consists mainly of effector sites (lamina propria). 28, 29 The ileal lymphoid tissue consists of both effector sites (lamina propria) and the major inductive sites (Peyer's patches). 29, 30 The ASC responses detected in the duodenum and ileum were presumably attributed to lymphoid cells in the lamina propria because no plasma cell development occurs in Peyer's patches. 28, 31 The anatomical difference between the duodenum and ileum of pigs may explain the different patterns of ASC and memory B-cell responses detected. For mice, it has been suggested that the memory B cells committed to IgA production and which originate in inductive sites (Peyer's patches and MLN) 28, 32 are also resident in these sites 6 weeks after intramuscular immunization. 32 Other studies of mice showed that rotavirus-speci\u00aec IgA memory B cells were detected in both Peyer's patches and the small intestinal lamina propria, but with a delayed appearance in the lamina propria. 33, 34 The distribution and magnitude of the memory B-cell isotypes between Peyer's patches and the ileal lamina propria were not examined in the current study because of the dif\u00aeculty in isolating and separating MNC from the Peyer's patches and ileal lamina propria of gnotobiotic pigs. Therefore, the ileal MNC originated from both types of lymphoid tissues in the ileum.",

Of\u00aet (personal communication) showing that no rotavirus-speci\u00aec IgA or IgG ASC or memory B cells were detected in bone marrow after adult mice were inoculated orally with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) from PID 21 to PID 126. Although Williams et al. 14 reported, in their study of adult mice orally inoculated twice with murine rotavirus EC strain, that rotavirus-speci\u00aec ASC were detected at PID 50\u00b165 in the bone marrow, the absolute numbers of rotavirus-speci\u00aec ASC in the lamina propria were more than 1000-fold higher than those in bone marrow. It appears that the few ASC detected in the bone marrow may have been ASC in the peripheral blood traf\u00aecking through the bone marrow (the ASC numbers in the peripheral blood were not reported in this study). Similarly, Williams et al. 14 reported that rotavirus-speci\u00aec,\u00afuorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-separated a4b7 IgA memory B cells, adoptively transferred from donor mice seven months after oral EC rotavirus inoculation into RAG-2 mice, preferentially resided in the lamina propria with ASC numbers at least 250-fold higher than in bone marrow. In pigs, the bone marrow showed a similar or lower magnitude of ASC responses compared to that seen in the peripheral blood. Other research teams 6,35\u00b137 have reported that bone marrow was the major site of long-term antibody production after oral inoculation of mice with cholera toxin, 35 after an acute systemic infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), 36, 37 and in mice systemically immunized with the T-cell-dependent antigen, ovalbumin. 6 Because of limitations in the length of time that gnotobiotic pigs can be maintained in isolation units, longer-term B-cell responses beyond PID 83 were not evaluated in this animal model. However, very few ASC or memory B cells were detected in bone marrow, on PID 28, 35 or 83, of pigs inoculated with virulent Wa HRV. Thus, our data and the studies of mice infected with RRV (ref. 14; C.A., Moser & P.A. Of\u00aet, personal communication) suggest that bone marrow is not an inductive or a resident site for primary effector and memory B cells after a heterologous rotavirus infection of pigs (HRV) or mice (RRV). Differences between replicating organisms and non-replicating antigens, and the target tissues and replication sites for a systemic virus (LCMV) versus an enteric virus (Wa HRV), could be the main reasons for the divergent responses observed.",

Interestingly, however, the IgG memory B cells induced by virulent Wa HRV were resident in both the ileum and spleen, with the latter tissue and not the bone marrow the predominant site on PID 83. The IgA memory B cells detected in the spleen on PID 83 of pigs inoculated with virulent HRV may explain the successful use of the parenteral route of inoculation to boost mucosal antibody responses and protection, as observed in studies of orally primed pigs and humans. 38, 39 In the longer-term study of pigs inoculated with virulent Wa HRV, the serum IgA antibody titres started to decline after PID 34; however, the serum IgG antibody titres were maintained at peak levels from PID 57 to PID 83. Our previous study has also shown that high titres of virus-speci\u00aec IgG antibodies, but not IgA antibodies, persist in the serum for prolonged time-periods after inoculation with either virulent or attenuated Wa HRV. 23 These \u00aendings suggest that the spleen is a major site for long-term serum IgG antibody production in rotavirus-inoculated pigs. Signi\u00aecant waning of IgA memory B-cell responses from PID 28 to PID 83 in the intestine of pigs inoculated with virulent Wa HRV, indicates a short B-cell memory to rotavirus infection in pigs. These results agree with previous observations that IgA memory to mucosal pathogens was short lived and needed periodic boosting to be maintained, as often occurs after repeated re-exposure to endemic enteric pathogens in the environment. 40, 41 In contrast, memory B-cell responses to murine rotavirus EDIM in mice at 16 weeks postinoculation were even higher than those at 6 weeks postinoculation. 33 It will be of interest to assess the association between B-cell memory responses and protective immunity against reinfection in pigs at PID 83; however, we could not challenge gnotobiotic pigs with HRV at this timepoint owing to the limitation in the size of the isolation units and the potential reduced susceptibility of older pigs to rotavirus diarrhoea for assessment of postchallenge protection beyond PID 83.",

            "text": "Optimization of the ELISPOT assay for the detection of memory B cells was carried out using dose\u00b1response studies. The in vitro antigen dose played an important role in the development of ASC from memory B cells. The viability of MNC in the present study was very similar to that of a previous study of conventional pigs infected with enteric or respiratory coronaviruses, 25 in which the viabilities of MNC from the spleen and MLN were 50\u00b160%, and for the duodenum and ileum were 5\u00b115%, on day 5 of culture. The wide variation in viability of MNC among tissues in the present study prompted us to quantify the amount of in vitro antigen that would adequately promote memory B-cell proliferation and differentiation for each tissue. Results from dose\u00b1response studies showed that an antigen dose of 6 mg was optimal in our ELISPOT assay system for the detection of memory B cells in the MLN and spleen, but slightly less optimal for the detection of memory B cells in the ileum. When the Wa HRV antigen dose was increased from 6 mg to 24 mg, IgA and IgG memory B-cell numbers in both spleen and MLN started to decline, indicating that memory B cells in these two tissues were suf\u00aeciently stimulated and that the lower numbers of IgA memory B cells detected in the MLN of pigs inoculated with attenuated Wa HRV compared to those in the spleen and peripheral blood was not because of underestimation by poor in vitro antigen stimulation. The possible selective expression of systemic homing receptors (e.g. a4b1, L-selectin) on B cells activated by attenuated Wa HRV could explain the greater ASC responses in the systemic lymphoid tissues versus intestine in this group of pigs. 14 A fourfold higher dose of restimulating antigen resulted in a twofold increased viability and similarly increased the numbers of IgA and IgG memory B cells from the ileum of pigs inoculated with virulent Wa HRV. This \u00aending suggests that the memory B cells in the ileum had a lower af\u00aenity to the recall antigen or a higher threshold for reactivation than the memory B cells in the spleen and MLN. If the higher antigen dose were used, slightly higher memory B-cell numbers might have been detected in the intestinal lymphoid tissues; however, it would not alter the conclusions drawn from the present results, as the ileum showed the strongest memory B-cell responses among all the tissues. The requirements for different antigen doses for the induction of optimal IgA and IgG memory B-cell responses from different lymphoid tissues may be explained by the assumption that the immune regulatory cells (including CD4 + , ab and cd T helper cells, and antigen-presenting cells) are distributed and function differently in different sites in the immune system. 42 In conclusion, inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with virulent or attenuated Wa HRV induced different localization patterns of ASC and memory B cells. Substantial IgA B-cell memory was established in the ileum, and later in the spleen, but not in the duodenum or bone marrow of gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with virulent Wa HRV. The magnitude of the IgA and IgG ASC responses in the intestinal lymphoid tissues and IgA memory B-cell responses in the ileum, but not IgG ASC or memory B-cell responses in the systemic lymphoid tissues, was associated with protective immunity in pigs inoculated and challenged with virulent Wa HRV. Our \u00aendings on the sites of resident memory B cells generated in response to an enteric viral infection parallel recent \u00aendings on the distribution of memory T cells. 43, 44, 45 Lika a substantial subset of T-cell memory, short-term B-cell memory also resides in nonorganized lymphoid tissues such as the ileal lamina propria.",
