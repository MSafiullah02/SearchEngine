While public health is simply a collection of individual citizens' health, it can be influenced by, mental and physical, individual and collective, and social and environmental factors. For example, maintaining physical health begins with an individual's mental awareness of hygienic concerns; however, individual awareness alone is insufficient. This is because even an individual citizen's health has an externality through which one's health condition affects - or is affected by - others, both consciously and unconsciously. Given this externality, public health often transcends the individual level and, therefore, eventually requires public concern and sometimes government intervention (Goyal & Vigier, 2015; Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, & Owens, 2010).",

Metaphorically, ICT-based health risk communication policy is akin to pair skating: the policy's success depends on how well the two players work together and neither can flourish alone. In other words, benefiting from ICT-based health information systems and e-government initiatives depends on the coordination and collaboration between a government and its citizens. Therefore, this study explores the answer to the question: How can the government information services provided to citizens through ICT better facilitate citizens being active participants and faithful stakeholders in public health governance, rather than just passive observers? As part of ICT application, the government's social media sites refer to \u201ca group of Internet-based applications\u201d with Web 2.0 interactive features used by the government to share information and collaborate with internal and external entities (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010, p. 61). This study specifically focuses on social media accounts that the health department and agencies in the Korean government own and operate on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, for public health communication.",

This investigation adds to the current understanding of how to stimulate citizen engagement and stewardship using new government-led ICT solutions and programs for public health risk communication from an accountable and collaborative governance perspective. However, the empirical evidence that shows whether implementing e-government services of public health risk communication leads to citizens' acceptance and usage of such services is not provided. Therefore, the present study aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive framework to explain and predict users' requirements for adopting e-government technologies and participating in new ICT operations provided through social media. Specifically, by incorporating the citizen's information-seeking behavior into the e-Government Adoption Model (GAM) developed by Shareef et al. (2011), this study examines the effects of critical factors affecting citizens' decision-making in terms of adopting a new technology-driven government system, such as public health risk communication, on government social media sites.",

On the other hand, this research offers managerial insight into how governments can be more accountable and better help citizens fulfill their responsibility using ICT-based health risk communication. Taken together, these efforts facilitate sustainable public health practices in the social media-based public governance era. Given the rapid proliferation and widespread use of social media by government agencies, this study illustrates which policy instruments and transformation strategies should be implemented both by the governed and those governing to enhance public accountability and the effective governance of health risk communication in this new ICT-driven governance ecosystem.",

Moreover, most of the Korean public health agencies and government healthcare organizations already heavily use social media platforms, apps, and networks as cost-effective and convenient means toward spreading information, practices, and solutions concerning personal and community health initiatives since the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea.

Although there are numerous definitions of accountability, we can generally agree, \u201cAccountability is about explanation and justification to a forum with the possibility of sanctions as a result\u201d (Hughes, 2012, p.187). Accountability is the \u201crelationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor has an obligation to explain and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can pose questions and pass judgment, and the actor may face consequences\u201d (Bovens, 2007).

It is closely akin to accountability or answerability,\u201d (p.7) and subjective responsibility as feeling responsible and behaving responsibly in a cultural and social context. Hughes (2012) differentiated between accountability and responsibility using organizational hierarchy. He argued that a staff member is accountable to a superior, whereas every superior is responsible for the actions of his or her subordinates. In sum, despite the various attempts to distinguish between accountability and responsibility, their differences are not always clear, and the two terms are often interchangeable. Still, the common argument on accountability prescribes the existence of at least two parties, in which one party expects the other to act beneficially and to not do something harmful (Hughes, 2012; Mulgan, 2000; O'Loughlin, 1990; Romzek & Dubnick, 1994; Saltzstein, 1992).",

We are all expected to maintain our health. Otherwise, we place the burden of caring for ourselves onto others. In other words, public health has an aspect of externality. Citizens should protect themselves from health risks, both individually and collectively. However, because of the externality of the health problem, citizens also empower and require the government to protect them from health risks through public health policies.",

Governments are supposed to satisfy four types of accountability (Romzek & Dubnick, 1987; Romzek & Ingraham, 2000): (1) hierarchical accountability to obey organizational directives; (2) legal accountability to comply with external mandates; (3) professional accountability to defer to individual judgment and expertise; and (4) political accountability to be responsive to key external stakeholders. Among the four, public sector reform has placed great emphasis on professional and political accountability (Romzek, 2000). Regarding public health, governments are accountable for providing risk communication to more citizens, for example, in this day and age, by using ICT. Simply put, citizens and governments have their own accountabilities regarding the mitigation of public health problems.",

In health risk management, there is a spectrum of citizen participation (Donahue & Zeckhauser, 2011).

The third challenge involves co-production between citizens and government. Citizens are increasingly becoming co-producers with their governments for public values (Alford, 2009). When it comes to health risk communication using ICT, the citizens who use ICT media are expected to act (or be well prepared to act) as not only information recipients but also information producers or disseminators (Moorhead et al., 2013; Park, Reber, & Chon, 2016). The fourth challenge concerns citizens' utilization of health-related services.

Furthermore, those with more sources of information reported higher levels of self-reliance when making health-related decisions (Hall et al., 2015). Information-seeking behavior is part of the effort to cope with information insufficiency, which positively influences the adoption of new communication technology (Golant, 2017).

Perceived information quality and perceived functional benefit are key factors that lead users to adopt ICT-based government services. These two concepts imply that people who believe new technology will provide useful information and help them complete tasks efficiently tend to accept the technology and make use of it (Shareef et al., 2011). Perceptions of usefulness, regarding information quality and task completion, have been reported to play a considerable role in the adoption of information technologies (Oliveira, Faria, Thomas, & Popovi\u010d, 2014; Ozkan & Kanat, 2011; Wirtz et al., 2015). Another important aspect of ICT-based services that encourages adoption behavior is the security of a system. Perceived security refers to the degree to which users perceive that a technology ensures the security of personal information and uses their information appropriately (Shareef et al., 2011). Problems related to user privacy are considerable barriers that hinder the success of new information technology (Gilbert, Balestrini, & Littleboy, 2004). Thus, security provisions should be ensured for citizens considering the use of ICT-based government services (Bertot, Jaeger, & Hansen, 2012). The perception that a technology is secure and safe to use relates positively to the usage of that technology (Shareef et al., 2011; Venkatesh, Chan, & Thong, 2012). Based on the theoretical background and empirical evidence discussed above, we hypothesize:H2Individuals with favorable perceptions of ease of use, information quality, functional benefit, and security will be more likely to use the government's social media sites for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.\n",

By adopting the conceptualization of the internet's self-efficacy established by Eastin and LaRose (2000), this study defines social media competency as the degree to which a person is confident in his or her ability to perform tasks on social media required to meet given communication goals. Previous research suggests that higher levels of social media competency lead to increased perceptions of usefulness and ease of use with a new application (Cheng & Mitomo, 2017; Slade, Dwivedi, Piercy, & Williams, 2015). Thus, we propose the following two hypotheses:H3Individuals with higher levels of social media competency will be more likely to seek risk information using these platforms.\nH4Individuals with higher levels of social media competency will be more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use.\n",

Lack of trust in the government hinders the adoption of e-government services by its citizens (Fakhoury & Aubert, 2015; Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Park, Choi, Kim, & Rho, 2015). Increased trust in the government, however, leads citizens to perceive government services positively and thus bolsters faith in these services (Gefen, Karahanna, & Straub, 2003). Trust in the services that the government offers on social media, in turn, is expected to promote intentions to use them for information acquisition and interactions with the government for better task achievement (Shareef et al., 2011). This line of reasoning leads to the following hypotheses:H5Individuals with higher levels of trust in the government will be more likely to perceive the government's social media sites for risk preparation positively in terms of (a) ease of use, (b) information quality, (c) functional benefit, and (d) security.\nH6Trust in the government's social media sites will mediate the influences of perceptions of those sites (such as ease of use, information quality, functional benefit, and security) on intentions to use them for (a) obtaining risk information and (b) engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.\nH7Intention to use the government's social media sites for obtaining risk information will relate positively to one's intention to use the sites for engaging in interactions with the government for risk preparation.\n",

Therefore, a variety of digital government services and smart technologies on public safety and healthcare promotion are fully generalized in Korean society (Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2012; Rana et al., 2017). In this study, we employed a professional market research company specialized in panel data research on public health, public hygiene, and healthcare, in order to ensure the representativeness and validity of the study. The research company conducted quota sampling, based on the Korean Population and Housing Census 2017, and extracted 1050 respondents who have received or/and consulted the information on public health from the e-government services through government websites and smartphone application. As a result, this company recruited 1050 citizens based on their availability, not by exploiting screening questions.

Obtaining information pertains more to one-way communication in which the government provides constant updates and relevant risk information using social media (e.g., progress on outbreak containment, availability of vaccines, and possible preventive measures) without receiving any feedback or inquiries from citizens. Interactions with the government describe the two-way communication that occurs through reciprocal dialogues such as commenting on social media posts, having live Twitter chats, and sending direct messages to ask and answer specific questions.

By integrating trust and health risk information into the e-government adoption model (GAM), we conducted survey with 700 Korean citizens and analyzed these data using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that individuals with higher social media competency are more likely to seek risk information through social media and are more likely to perceive the government's social media sites as easy to use. Our findings confirm that, with regards to the GAM, citizens' intentions to use these services increases if the services are perceived as more valuable. In addition, the perceived trust in the government's social media resources functions as a mediator of this process.",
