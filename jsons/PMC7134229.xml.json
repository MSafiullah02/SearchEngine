It has to do with saving, making and receiving payments, transacting, receiving credit, and insurance [5]. It is needed for all business organizations especially the small scale businesses in the developing nations. The inclusion helps the small scaled companies to access credits that could be invested in their businesses. It also helps in saving of cash such that future investments or response to unforeseeable risks can be carried out [6]. Financial inclusion improves the access to insurance products and services which are critical towards addressing vulnerabilities in businesses [7]. Therefore one of the elements of good governance in any country is to have adequate FI schemes for small scale businesses with view to (1) improve production of good and services; (2) increase employment rate and vis-\u00e0-vis the standard of living of the people.",

Data grow geometrically in different forms in terms of structure, size, semantics, varieties etc. Therefore this increases the complexity of data and hence use of traditional database management system for data management becomes a challenge. Thus big data technology evolved to help organizations and government collect, organize, represent, process, and analyse data from many sources with the view to reducing cost and time; optimizing the use of resources and developing new products; and making smart decisions [9]. Financial inclusion dataset are big datasets and they are always needed by both private and public sectors. The datasets are diverse in terms of Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, Veracity, Visualization, and Value (i.e. 7 V\u2019s of Big Data) [10]. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the analysis of the financial inclusion dataset for Eswatini with the view to carefully classify FI data set based on selected parameters for Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni and Lubombo regions of Eswatini using Logistic regression (LR) and SVM. Machine learning technique has been identified to be very useful for analysis of government-based data and hence infer relevant hidden facts from them [11].",

This was based on the critical role that GoS attached for FI. The FI journey for GoS dated back to 2010 in which the government through the Ministry of Finance (MoF) established the Micro Finance Unit (MFU) to implement the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) supported Rural Finance and Enterprise Development Programme (RFEDP) with the view of facilitating access to financial services for the rural population and the micro and small scale businesses. In 2013, Ministry of Finance of GoS joined the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), which is a global movement on FI and this helps to impact directly on the welfare of people at microeconomic and household levels. It helps to reduce people\u2019s transaction costs and hence enabling them to efficiently manage risks, allocating capital for productive use and supporting the accumulation of wealth over time [13]. There are three dimensions of FI: Access, usage and quality. The comprehensive document of the GoS financial inclusion strategy is well presented in [13]. It is expected that the proposed strategy will lead to increase in reach, depth and quality of FI in Swaziland, and a sustainable financial sector that is able to increase citizen welfare, create economic growth, and hence meet national goals. It also presents the level of readiness of the government of Swaziland about financial inclusiveness. In this light few research works have been reported in the recent time on FI as it affect Swaziland.",

Financial cooperatives are means of providing financial services to low-income earners and hence make them to be in the FI scheme of government. Financial services acquisition journey model in the context of Eswatini was proposed. The model offered an integrated representation whereby financial services are fully extended to low-income earners with the view to access funds and credit facilities and hence guarantees financial inclusiveness for them. Thus financial cooperatives are noted among the distribution channels for credit facilities. This aligns with the interest of United Nations (UN) and International Labour Organization (ILO) towards financial cooperatives as mechanism that should be utilized to promote FI within the low-income earners [15]. However the author in [15] noted the mixed views about the role of savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) to facilitate access to financial services for people in Swaziland. Thus it was reported in the research that more knowledge is required about role of SACCOs and development of better scheme for quick access to loan and repayment of loan by their members which are mostly low-income earners.",

Similarly Mngadi noted in the research reported in [17] the role that microfinance institutions played on entrepreneurship in Swaziland. It was recommended that microfinance institutions should focus more on developmental finance for small scale businesses and low-income earner. In [18] crop insurance was identified as another FI scheme. Though it served as a means of protecting farmers against potential losses and hence minimize risk but it was noted in Swaziland that crop insurance is not well developed and implemented due to shallow knowledge of farmers about the preference for crop insurance. Similar study was carried out by Xolile in [19] focusing on livestock insurance. In [20], investment was also identified as one of the key instruments for equitable income distribution to ensure FI but this is also not well explored in low income countries and fragile environment.",

FI is considered as one of the significant indicator of inclusive growth in governance [22]. A number of research works have been done on financial inclusion across the continents. In [23], the authors criticized the unambitious approach that did not include FI as a sustainable goal in 2030 agenda for sustainable development in developing countries. The authors noted that FI was not included as a stand-alone goal among the several sustainable development goals (SDGs). The reasons identified for this are the: instrumentality argument, free market argument, and veil argument. The 2030 agenda was seen as a missed opportunity to focus on finding means to meeting the financial need of the global poor. This implies that in developing economies, the financial bridge between the rich and the poor keep widening as the government fail to extend good governance to the poor through the establishment of a strong financial structure that makes FI to be fully extended to the poor. Similarly in [24] positive influence of mobile micro-insurance on FI in developing countries was investigated and it was established that inclusive financing is more successful in countries that adopt and use mobile micro-insurance compared to countries where such services are not made available to the poor or low-income earners. It is inferred from this study that the use of low-cost mobile channels of micro-insurance would enable low-income earners and small scale businesses to have immediate access to micro-insurance and this contributes to financial inclusiveness. Thus governance should be extended to low-cost or rural communities by erecting good infrastructural facilities and making good policies to support establishment of micro-insurance and low-cost mobile channels in these areas. Ozili in [25] reviewed digital finance (DF) vis-\u00e0-vis FI in the context of developing and emerging economies. It was noted that the mesh of DF and FI has lots of benefits to financial services users, DF providers, government and the economy in general. This corroborates with the study reported in [24]. C\u00e9lerier and Matray in [26] did a study on the effects of FI on wealth accumulation in the context of USA. The authors studied the USA interstate branching deregulation policy between 1994 and 2005 and established that expansion of the bank branches across the states helped to increase access to funds the low-income earners, hence it increase the low-income household FI. These studies presented in [22, 27] looked at empowering women through financial inclusion. The authors noted that most of the Indian women that make up 46% of the India total population are denied opportunities and rights to financial access and this made them to be financially dependent. The authors affirmed that FI is needed for the women in order to pay for micro-insurance and obtain credit from financial institutions. This helps in national development by women improving access to markets and overall empowerment data.",

These research works are mostly exploratory studies that focus mainly on the behaviour of the people (mostly low income earners and small scale entrepreneurs) towards micro-finance, micro-insurance, financial cooperatives and banks. Some also focused on the saving and investment attitude of low-income earners. None of the works access or make use of FI data set for Eswatini and no computational technique is applied in the course of data analysis.We noted that none of these research works relates FI with governance and neither did the authors make use of intelligent techniques such as machine learning techniques for mining the FI data set with the view to extracting more meaningful information that could impact on the governance of the country as per financial distribution, use and proper management. Also none of the works applied data mining or machine learning technique to process the FI data set with the view to understand the data pattern, ascertain the validity and accuracy of the data set.\n",

On bank usage, it was discovered that only 47.5% has used commercial bank, 66.4% used mobile money, 7.2% used cooperative society, 10% used insurance, 4.9% used pension fund and 0.9% used microfinance. Most households in local communities does not have bank account so government need to come up with a policy to encourage cashless society that will also give room for credit accessibility and use of financial institution.From the classification algorithm in machine learning, the recall result in Table 3 is an indication that the government of Eswatini need to pay more attention to enhance financial inclusion in the these three regions (HhoHho, Shiselweni and Lubombo) with more attention on Lubombo.It was discovered in this study that 66.7% of the household in low-income earning communities make use of mobile money for making payment then the government need to consider mobile money as part of the key indicator for financial inclusion.The government also need to encourage head of household on the importance of business registration since only 3.8% registered their businesses.Research in this area is few in Swaziland and this is attested to by Zikalala in [15] and Kanyangale [16].Low-income earners and small scale entrepreneurs should be encouraged to bank in order to have access to credit facilities with the view to expand FI and thus have all the low-income earners included. Similar recommendation was made in [19].Financial empowerment programmes are recommended to train people in various households on investment vis-\u00e0-vis financial management. Such programmes open up the credit opportunities in financial institutions (i.e. Banks, Microfinance, Micro-insurance, Financial cooperatives etc.) and how they can be accessible to low-income earners. This is similar to the recommendations stated in [28, 29].\n",

            "text": "Presently in Africa there is so much interest to promote financial inclusion based on the commitment of so many countries to financial inclusion action plan to reduce poverty and grow their economy [26, 30]. But Africa as a continent is lagging behind other continents in financial inclusion because inclusive development is left out [5, 31]. Our findings in this study show that there is still need to revamp the financial inclusion datasets on the demand-side using machine learning methods for exploring different pre-processing algorithms to eliminate the remaining outliers in the dataset to improve the classification accuracy which is yet to be looked into critically due to lack of data quality. A better classification can only be achieved when there is good quality of data. The Confusion matrix was discussed in this paper using logistic regression and SVM to classify the actual and observations (true positive, true negative, false negative and false positive) from the payment channel, registered/unregistered/licensed business, usage of commercial banks, mobile money, insurance, microfinance, cooperative society and source of income for head of household. The results show that the veracity of the financial inclusion dataset is weak and this is due to the fact that the precision and recall rate is less than 50% and 70% respectively. Therefore, it is expedient to separate the demand-side data from the supply side data from the entire dataset and also to employ different pre-processing approaches or data transformation techniques to improve the quality of the data which will automatically improve the classification accuracy. The misclassification of the features misrepresents the causes underlying financial inclusion due to the precision rate against the recall rate.",
