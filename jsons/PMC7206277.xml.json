Different from the conventional recommendation settings [11], IRS consecutively recommend items to individual users and receive their feedback in interactive processes. IRS gradually refine the recommendation policy according to the obtained user feedback in an online manner. The goal of such a system is to maximize the total utility over the whole interaction period. A typical utility of IRS is user acceptance of recommendations. Conversion Rate (CVR) is one of the most commonly used measures of recommendation acceptance, computing the ratio of users performing a system\u2019s desired activity to users having viewed recommended items. A desired activity could be downloading from App stores, or making loans for microlending.",

On the other hand, existing recommender systems have been demonstrated to favor popular items [5], resulting in extremely unbalanced recommendation results.

Forcing the system to be fair at any time and increasing fairness uniformly for all users will result in poor recommendations. In fact, IRS focus on the long-term cumulative utility over the whole interaction session, where the system could focus on improving accuracy for users with particular favor, and the lack of fairness at the time can later be compensated when recommending items to users with diversified interests. As such, we can achieve long-term system\u2019s fairness while preserving satisfying recommendation quality.(ii)Existing work only considers the distribution of the number of recommendations (exposure) an item group received. Actually, the distribution of the desired activities that take place after an exposure like clicks or downloads has much larger commercial value and can be directly converted to revenue.\n",

The major contributions of this paper are as follows:We formulate a fairness objective for IRS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that balances between accuracy and fairness in IRS.We propose a reinforcement learning based framework, FairRec, to dynamically maintain a balance between accuracy and fairness in IRS. In FairRec, user preferences and the system\u2019s fairness status are jointly compressed into the state representation to generate recommendations. We also design a two-fold reward to combine accuracy and fairness.We evaluate our proposed FairRec algorithm on both synthetic and real-world data. We show that FairRec can achieve a better balance between accuracy and fairness, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n",

Value-based methods are more sample-efficient and steady, but the computational cost is high when the action space is large. Policy-based methods directly learn a policy that takes as input of the current user state and outputs an action [6, 24], which generally have a faster convergence. Actor-critic architectures take advantage of both value-based and policy-based methods [15, 25]. Therefore, we design our model following the actor-critic framework.",

The retained dataset has 1,589 loans, 589 lenders and 43,976 ratings.

In the proposed state representation component, UPS models both personalized preference and propensity to diversity; FS is utilized to describe the current fairness status of IRS. A two-fold reward is designed to combine accuracy and fairness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in the balance of accuracy and fairness of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-art models.",
