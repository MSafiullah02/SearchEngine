On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 15 of the 59 cases of pneumonia were caused by a novel coronavirus (later named SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19) [3]. On the same day, information about the new coronavirus was presented to the international community through the International Health Regulations (IHR) alert system. Immediately after receiving this announcement, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate, which is a public administration authority involved in public health services in Poland, established a response team responsible for developing guidelines and evidence-based strategies for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic [4]. The present study aimed to: (1) present public health interventions aimed at mitigating the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 implemented in Poland between January 9 and March 29, 2020, and (2) analyze the potential impact of these regulations on the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland.",

On January 20, the first travel warning for the novel coronavirus pandemic was released [8]. This travel warning provided brief information on 205 cases of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus as well as recommendations for travelers planning to travel to Wuhan, China. On January 22, the Committee on Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases and Vaccinations developed a case definition of suspected COVID-19 [9].

On January 25, 2 days after the Wuhan City lock-down, the first group of Polish students on an academic exchange in Wuhan returned to Poland. All students returning from Wuhan City were hospitalized in the infectious disease wards, and laboratory tests excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection [12]. On January 27, Germany declared its first confirmed COVID-19 case [13]; this was the first case of COVID-19 in a country neighboring Poland. The key activity in the last week of January was constant monitoring of the sanitary and epidemiological situation at the border administrative regions (voivodships), airports, and seaports. All airport procedures were regularly updated to reflect the current epidemiological situation [14]. On January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [15].",

Laboratory tests excluded COVID-19. The travel warnings were published daily in February and were updated according with the current world epidemiological situation [17]. On February 22, the Italian authorities reported clusters of cases in Lombardy [18]. On February 23, the ECDC announced that the risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people from the EU was considered to be low to moderate [18]. On the same day, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate recommended that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to Northern Italy (a total of 9 countries, including China, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan) [19]. Due to the growing number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, guidelines for medical staff were regularly updated. Moreover, several guidelines and recommendations were developed for specific professional groups as well as public and private entities. On February 29, 87 people were hospitalized as suspected COVID-19 cases, 146 were quarantined, and 3370 were under epidemiological supervision.",
