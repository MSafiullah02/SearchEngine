            "text": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain has been used to investigate a wide range of neurological disorders and depending on the imaging sequence used, can produce different modalities such as T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Each of these modalities produce different contrast and brightness of brain tissue that could reveal pathological abnormalities. Many of the advances in the use of data-driven models in Alzheimer\u2019s disease classification [17], brain tumour segmentation [9] and skull stripping methods [18], rely on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). In particular, datasets such as BraTs [23] and ISLES [19] have been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumours and stroke lesions respectively. These methods do not require the use of hand designed features and instead are able to learn a hierarchy of increasingly complex features. However, they require multiple neuroimaging modalities for high performance and improved sensitivity [4] (See Fig. 1). Collecting multiple modalities for each patient can be difficult, expensive and not all of these modalities are available in clinical settings. In particular, paired data, where an example has all modalities present, is difficult to access, making these data dependent models more difficult to train or reduce their applicability during inference.\n",

Methods proposed by Zhu et al. [37] and Hoffman et al. [11] assume the two image collections are representations of some shared, underlying state. They use adversarial training which discriminates at the image level to guide the transformation between the domains. Furthermore, the translations between these two sets should have approximately invertible solutions and should be cycle consistent- where the mapping of a particular source domain to the target domain and back should yield the original source at the pixel level. Alternative methods extract domain invariant features with DCNNs and discriminate the feature distributions of source/target domains [32].",

Isola et al.\u2019s [12] work in particular, uses labeled image pairs to train a cGAN to learn a mapping between the two image domains. On the other hand, there have been significant works that have tackled image-to-image translation in the unpaired setting. The CycleGAN [37] uses a cycle consistency loss to ensure the forward mapping and back results in the original image. It has demonstrated success in tasks where paired training data is limited e.g. in painting style and season transfer. The Dual GAN, being inspired by dual learning in machine translation used a similar loss objective, where the reconstruction error is used to measure the disparity between the reconstructed object and the original [36]. Unlike the previous two frameworks, the CoGAN [16] and cross-modal scene networks [1] does not use a cycle consistency loss but instead, uses weight sharing between the two GANs, corresponding to high level semantics to learn a common representation across domains.",

The consistent out-performance of our method over the CycleGAN demonstrate there is potential gains when the information from paired data points can be leveraged.

This can be attributed to the MSE component of the objective function where the MSE pushes the generator to produce blurry images [21]. The additional adversarial component of our method forces the generator to synthesise a more visually realistic image. However, in Fig. 3 the image produced does not match the pixel intensity of the ground truth and in Fig. 4, fails to capture the high detail and edges of the CBF modality and fails to distinguish between background and low intensity areas.",

Furthermore, the overall data available in limited and MRI volumes are high dimensional. The Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN) learns translations between neuroimaging modalities using unpaired data and paired examples through a cycle-consistency loss, an adversarial signal for the discrimination between generated and real images of each domain and an additional adversarial signal that discriminates between the pairs of real data and pairs of generated images.
