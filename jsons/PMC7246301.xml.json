For example, Nature has reported that China has been the largest producer of scientific publications by using Elsevier\u2019s Scopus database (Tollefson 2018), which is different from the finding based on Web of Science. Besides, different document types vary significantly regarding the academic value. However, previous studies tend to take into account all the document types or some important document types, such as articles and reviews. One study has shown that different countries may have quite different document-type country profiles (Zhang et al. 2011).

And China has even overtaken the United States as the largest producer of SCI-indexed original research articles in 2018. However, the quality/impact of China\u2019s scientific research outputs still lags behind, and a certain extent of paper bubbles also exists in China (Leydesdorff et al. 2014; Liu 2020). China needs to shift its research evaluation standards to emphasize more on the improvement of research quality and halt some problematic publishing practices (Liu 2020; Tang 2019; Tang et al. 2020; Zhu 2020).",

The latest reform in China may also decelerate the rapid growth of China\u2019s SCI publications (Liu 2020). However, the number of junior researchers who can publish in English is also increasing. With continuous investment of resources, we still predict that China will overtake the United States as the largest contributor to SCI-indexed publications in the following one or two years (all document types are considered). However, the cross-over between China and the United States cannot be misinterpreted or overinterpreted. The United States will continue to be the global scientific leader for a long time (Tollefson 2018).",
