At present, more than 500 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected, with the disease affecting all age groups, including children. Currently, the most important epidemiological factor linked to the disease is contact with individuals with confirmed infection, although travel to an area considered to be high-risk, such as Northern Italy, which is quite frequent due to its proximity to Spain, is also a significant factor.2\n",

Blood tests in children are usually normal and computed tomography (CT) scans reveal the presence of patchy infiltration (not always detectable in chest radiographs). There is evidence that children, even in cases of mild disease, can be an important source of transmission, with a rate of infection of close contacts of 7.4% in children aged less than 10 years, similar to the mean rate in the adult population of 7.9%.7 There is also evidence that children may shed virus, mainly in stools, for a prolonged time that may even reach 1 month, and that respiratory secretions in children may have high viral loads.8 No deaths have been reported in children under 10 years and most recover in 14\u201330 days.

We await the results of a clinical trial with lopinavir/ritonavir, which will shed light on the possibility of using this antiretroviral drug for treatment of COVID-19, as its efficacy is currently uncertain. Multiple studies in adults are comparing combination therapy with the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and other antivirals, although there are no data on the paediatric population. Remdesivir, the nucleotide analogue antiviral developed to treat Ebola, continues to be the drug considered most promising to be effective, and dosages of this drug have been established for the paediatric population. Its use for treatment of COVID-19 is off-label and a request for authorisation must be placed with the Agencia del Medicamento y Productos Sanitarios (Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices AEMPS).",

The mean age of these patients was 4.5 years, and 10 (16%) had underlying disease. Of the 63 patients known to have been tested, 13 (20%) were contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, 15 (28%) were patients with compatible symptoms and risk factors (travel to high-risk area or close contact with adults with compatible symptoms and a history of travel to a high-risk area), and 35 (63%) were patients admitted to hospital with severe respiratory illness and no known epidemiological risk factors. The most frequent clinical presentation in these patients was pneumonia (n = 32/35; 91%), with or without associated wheezing (Table 1\n). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed by testing of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens in 5 patients (8%). Two of them were contacts of confirmed cases, 2 were first-degree relatives of a contact of a confirmed case, and 1 was a case with no identifiable source of infection.",
