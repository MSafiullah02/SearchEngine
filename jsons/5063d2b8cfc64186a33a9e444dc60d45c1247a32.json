Currently, there is still no licensed specific antiviral treatment for the human coronavirus disease and a vaccine will not be ready soon. However, based on experience from the use of other antiviral agents to treat similar virusses, some treatment options have been tried with some efficacy. Clinical trials for future therapies are still ongoing. In the meantime, prevention, control, active communication and investment in research are the only ways to overcome this challenge.",
