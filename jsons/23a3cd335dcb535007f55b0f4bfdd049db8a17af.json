It has been reported that viral pneumonia in pregnant women is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, FGR and perinatal mortality 43 . Based on nationwide population-based data, it was demonstrated that pregnant women with other viral pneumonias (n = 1462) had an increased risk of preterm birth, FGR and having a newborn with low birth weight and Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, compared with those without pneumonia (n = 7310) 44 . In 2004, a case series of 12 pregnant women with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, China, reported three maternal deaths, that four of seven patients who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage, four of five patients who presented after 24 weeks had preterm birth and two mothers recovered without delivery but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by FGR 9 . Pregnant women with suspected/probable COVID-19 infection, or those with confirmed infection who are asymptomatic or recovering from mild illness, should be monitored with 2-4-weekly ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, with umbilical artery Doppler if necessary 45 . At present, it is uncertain whether there is a risk of vertical mother-to-baby transmission. In a study by Chen et al. 46 , of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester, amniotic fluid, cord blood and neonatal throat-swab samples collected from six patients tested negative for COVID-19, suggesting there was no evidence of intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. However, there are currently no data on perinatal outcome when the infection is acquired in the first and early second trimester of pregnancy, and these pregnancies should be monitored carefully after recovery.",

            "text": "1. COVID-19 infection itself is not an indication for delivery, unless there is a need to improve maternal oxygenation. For suspected, probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, delivery should be conducted in a negative-pressure isolation room. The timing and mode of delivery should be individualized, dependent mainly on the clinical status of the patient, gestational age and fetal condition 48 . In the event that an infected woman has spontaneous onset of labor with optimal progress, she can be allowed to deliver vaginally. Shortening the second stage by operative vaginal delivery can be considered, as active pushing while wearing a surgical mask may be difficult for the woman to achieve 49 . With respect to a pregnant woman without a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, but who might be a silent carrier of the virus, we urge caution regarding the practice of active pushing while wearing a surgical mask, as it is unclear if there is an increased risk of exposure to any healthcare professional attending the delivery without PPE, because forceful exhalation may significantly reduce the effectiveness of a mask in preventing the spread of the virus by respiratory droplets 49 . Induction of labor can be considered when the cervix is favorable, but there should be a low threshold to expedite the delivery when there is fetal distress, poor progress in labor and/or deterioration in maternal condition. Septic shock, acute organ failure or fetal distress should prompt emergency Cesarean delivery (or termination, if legal, before fetal viability) 45 . For the protection of the medical team, water birth should be avoided. Both regional anesthesia and general anesthesia can be considered, depending on the clinical condition of the patient and after consultation with the obstetric anesthetist. 2. For preterm cases requiring delivery, we urge caution regarding the use of antenatal steroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) for fetal lung maturation in a critically ill patient, because this can potentially worsen the clinical condition 50 and the administration of antenatal steroids would delay the delivery that is necessary for management of the patient. The use of antenatal steroids should be considered in discussion with infectious-disease specialists, maternal-fetal-medicine subspecialists and neonatologists 37, 51 . In the case of an infected woman presenting with spontaneous preterm labor, tocolysis should not be used in an attempt to delay delivery in order to administer antenatal steroids. 3. Miscarried embryos/fetuses and placentae of COVID-19-infected pregnant women should be treated as infectious tissues and they should be disposed of appropriately; if possible, testing of these tissues for COVID-19 by qRT-PCR should be undertaken. 4. Regarding neonatal management of suspected, probable and confirmed cases of maternal COVID-19 infection, the umbilical cord should be clamped promptly and the neonate should be transferred to the resuscitation area for assessment by the attending pediatric team. There is insufficient evidence regarding whether delayed cord clamping increases the risk of infection to the newborn via direct contact 51 . In units in which delayed cord clamping is recommended, clinicians should consider carefully whether this practice should be continued. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the safety of breastfeeding and the need for mother-baby separation 46, 52 . If the mother is severely or critically ill, separation appears to be the best option, with attempts to express breastmilk in order to maintain milk production. Precautions should be taken when cleaning the breast pumps. If the patient is asymptomatic or mildly affected, breastfeeding and colocation (also called rooming-in) can be considered by the mother in coordination with healthcare providers, or may be necessary if facility limitations prevent mother-baby separation. Since the main concern is that the virus may be transmitted by respiratory droplets rather than breastmilk, breastfeeding mothers should ensure to wash their hands and wear a three-ply surgical mask before touching the baby. In case of rooming-in, the baby's cot should be kept at least 2 meters from the mother's bed, and a physical barrier such as a curtain may be used 53, 54 . 5. The need to separate mothers with COVID-19 infection from their newborns, with the consequence that they are unable to breastfeed directly, may impede early bonding as well as establishment of lactation 55 . These factors will inevitably cause additional stress for mothers in the postpartum period. As well as caring for their physical wellbeing, medical teams should consider the mental wellbeing of these mothers, showing appropriate concern and providing support when needed 55 .",

In units in which triage areas have been set up, staff should have appropriate protective equipment and be strictly compliant with hand hygiene. f. All pregnant patients who present to the hospital and for outpatient visits should be assessed and screened for symptoms and risk factors based on travel history, occupation, significant contact and cluster (TOCC) (Appendix 2). g. Pregnant patients with known TOCC risk factors and those with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection should delay antenatal visit and routine ultrasound assessment by 14 days. h. Consider reducing the number of visitors to the department. i. In units in which routine group-B streptococcus (GBS) screening is practiced, acquisition of vaginal and/or anal swabs should be delayed by 14 days in pregnant women with TOCC risk factors or should be performed only after a suspected/probable case tests negative or after recovery in a confirmed case. Intrapartum prophylactic antibiotic cover for women with ante-or intrapartum risk factors for GBS is an alternative. j. On presentation to triage areas, pregnant patients with TOCC risk factors should be placed in an isolation room for further assessment. k. Medical staff who are caring for suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients should be monitored closely for fever or other signs of infection and should not be working if they have any COVID-19 symptoms. Common symptoms at onset of illness include fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea and anorexia. Some national health authorities and hospital systems recommend that medical staff assigned to care for suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients should minimize contact with other patients and colleagues, with the aim of reducing the risk of exposure and potential transmission. l. Medical staff who have been exposed unexpectedly, while without PPE, to a COVID-19-infected pregnant patient, should be quarantined or self-isolate for 14 days. m. Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk-assessment and infection-control guidelines following exposure to patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19. KEY POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION 1. Pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection should be managed by designated tertiary hospitals, and they should be informed of the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. 2. Negative-pressure isolation rooms should be set up for safe labor and delivery and neonatal care. 3. During the COVID-19 epidemic period, a detailed history regarding recent travel, occupation, significant contact and cluster (i.e. TOCC) and clinical manifestations should be acquired routinely from all pregnant women attending for routine care. 4. Chest imaging, especially CT scan, should be included in the work-up of pregnant women with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection. 5",
