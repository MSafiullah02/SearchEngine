The genus Ebolavirus includes five EBOVs, of which EBOV is the causative agent of the current outbreak [2] . Three Ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause Ebola virus disease (EVD) that is clinically characterized by a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a fatality rate of up to 90% [3, 4] . In the 1970s, the first three EBOV outbreaks were indigenous to the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly known as Zaire) and Sudan with some cases identified in other African countries, but since then, no additional cases were identified until late 1994 [5] . In 2013-2015, the largest outbreak of EBOV hemorrhagic fever started in West Africa [6, 7] . The epidemic started in Republic of Guinea, initially in the prefecture of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou on December 2013 [8] . Few cases were discovered soon after in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria and one case in Senegal [7] . In the 2013-2015 outbreak, at least 22 859 were identified as suspected cases and 9162 as confirmed deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of this writing [7] . Several studies have considered different strategies to stop EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo such as the development of antiviral small molecules [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , antisense technology [18, 19] , and monoclonal antibody cocktails (such as ZMapp) [20] . In addition, selective estrogen receptor modulators, for example, clomiphene and toremifene [21] , ion channel blockers, for example, verapamil and amiodarone [22] , and adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis (VSV) and human parainfluenza-based vaccines as well as vaccines based on virus-like particle preparations have demonstrated potential efficacy [23, 24] . In the current review, we will describe the structure of the virus, the nature of the disease, and the current advances in the development of therapeutics.",

            "text": "Ebola virus and MARV belong to the Filoviridae family of enveloped viruses, order Mononegavirales, and are characterized by having a filamentous morphology [1, 4] . The filoviruses are known to be the major causes of hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates [25] . The filamentous morphology of the viruses led to the name Filoviridae, which is derived from the Latin word \"filum,\" which means filament [1] . The genus Ebolavirus includes five species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV; previously known as Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus), Reston virus (RESTV) and EBOV (formerly known as the Zaire ebolavirus; Figure 1 ) [2] . The SUDV and EBOV appear to be more involved with the known outbreaks and are more pathogenic than the RESTV and the TAFV [26] . Of the known EVD-causing viruses, EBOV is considered to be the most dangerous and was involved in the largest number of outbreaks including the 2013-2015 outbreak [2, 7] . The RESTV was a cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in non-human primates with no reported involvement in human disease so far [27] . Based on genetic similarities, the Ebolaviruses are closely related to Marburgviruses [2] .",

EBOV and MARV differ by approximately 55% at the genomic level and by up to 67% at the amino acid level [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . A difference in the GP gene organization has been reported between EBOV and MARV [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Between the five known species of the genus Ebolavirus, there is a difference of 37-40% and 34-43% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively [28, 32] . This indicates that BDBV, REBOV, SUDV, TAFV, and EBOV are distinct and represent different species. Despite the difference in the Ebolavirus species, they show some degree of genetic stability [28, 32, 34] . The genetic stasis suggests that there is an association with a particular host, and genetic variations are just ways of evolution and adaptation to the natural host. Within the order Mononegavirales, based on the extent of sequence homologies in the N-terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the filoviruses are considered more similar to paramyxoviruses than to rhabdoviruses [35] .",

The second and full-length larger gene product is the GP, which is produced by inserting an adenosine residue during transcription through RNA editing [28] . The GP is processed by furin enzyme, a subtilisin/kexin-like convertase localized in the trans-Golgi, at a polybasic cleavage site [65] . The mature protein has an N-terminus GP1 subunit (Mr 14 000) and a C-terminal GP2 subunit (Mr 26 000) linked by a disulfide bond [65] . The GP1 subunit contains several N-glycosylations and O-glycosylations [66] . The mature protein exists as homo-trimers on the surface of viral particles, and the trimerization is mediated by GP2 [46].",

In humans, EBOV infections have typically occurred in rural settings, possibly through contact with infected non-human primates' body fluids [67] . Evidence strongly suggests fruit bats as the natural reservoirs for EBOV [69] . In Africa, fruit bats such as Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata were found as the natural hosts of the EBOV [4] . In addition, non-human primates, such as apes or monkeys, can be infected [70] . Bats dropping partially eaten fruits represent the likely means by which the virus transmission to humans starts. Mammals like gorillas, apes, monkeys, or duikers feeding on the partially eaten fruits can acquire the infection, which can be then be transmitted to humans [67] . In Guinea, it is believed that the current outbreak started when a child played with insectivorous bats from a colony of Angolan freetailed bats near his or her village [71] . Early outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo have usually involved bat reservoirs in or around a subterranean gold mine [71] . People who are in healthcare settings, in close contact with secretions of an infected patient, or involved in the burial of infected dead bodies are at a higher risk for EBOV infection [72] . Transmission of EBOV occurs through close contact with skin and secretions of an individual suffering from active infection. Urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomitus, breast milk, and semen, and virus-contaminated objects can transmit the infection as well [73] . The infection with EBOV needs a relatively high viral dose of 10 7 -10 8 pfu/g [4] . Transmission is not likely to occur before the onset of symptoms. The incubation period of EBOV before the onset of symptoms ranges from 2 to 21 days [4] . The EBOVenters the body through small skin lesions and mucous membranes, after which it reaches the blood stream [73, 74] . There is no evidence for aerosol transmission although it cannot be excluded [75] .",

The GP1 subunit contains the receptorbinding domain and mediates interaction with the cognate receptor on the host cell, interacts with, and preserves the conformation of the GP2 transmembrane subunit [87] . The GP2 subunit contains the machinery required for the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane [85, 86] . The GP1 subunit consists of three domains: (i) the N-terminus half is highly conserved and forms the base that interacts extensively with GP2 maintaining it in its prefusion state; (ii) the head that contains the receptor-binding sequences; and (iii) the C-terminus domain, which comprises highly glycosylated regions named the glycan cap and the mucin domain [88] (Figure 2 ). The GP folding is mediated by the glycan cap, and in addition, the glycan cap has been reported to have a crucial role in entry [89, 90] . The mucin domain may not be required for the EBOV-GP dependent pseudovirus entry in vitro but is proposed to mediate viral adhesion to specific cell types and play a role in evasion of immune responses, by masking key neutralization epitopes [89, 90] . The base and the glycan cap are connected by a short loop. The GP2 transmembrane fusion subunit contains an N-terminal hydrophobic internal fusion peptide in addition to the N-terminal and C-terminal helical heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2; Figure 2 ) [85, 91] . The close interaction of the GP2-HR1 and GP2-HR2, triggered by GP processing during the viral entry, drives the fusion of the viral and host membranes [85, 91] .",

The broad host cell range suggests that the EBOV uses either a ubiquitously expressed receptor in all cell types or the virus can recognize and bind to several surface receptors expressed by different host cells. Evidence through several studies supports the latter scenario. The C-type lectins, for example, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, which are highly expressed on the surface of many cell types, were shown to mediate the entry of EBOV and the entry of other viruses [94, 95] . However, it is important to note that some cells that are permissive to the EBOV infection do not express the C-type lectins, and their role in natural infection remains to be determined. Moreover, several studies have shown that DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, LSECtin, hMGL, \u03b21-integrins, and Tyro-3 family receptors may be involved in the attachment of EBOV to the host cell surface, but none of the cellular factors proved to be essential for viral entry [94, [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] .",

Furthermore, NPC1 deficient hamster cell lines are not permissive to EBOV [104] . These studies suggest that the requirement for NPC1 may be indispensable for EBOV entry. The NPC1 role in EBOV entry is completely distinct from its function in cholesterol metabolism [104] . A study showed that the cleaved but not the uncleaved EBOV-GP binds to late endosomes, and the binding is NPC1 dependent suggesting that priming of GP by cysteine proteases is required for binding to NPC1 [105] .

TIM-1 and other lectins have been reported to trigger macropinocytosis [102] . Studies have shown that EBOV-GP pseudotyped viruses colocalize with Rab7 in late endosomes and a dominant negative inhibitor of Rab7 reduces infection [104, 107] . This suggests that delivery to late endosomes is crucial for viral entry. However, it is not yet known whether the virus delivers its genome to the cytoplasm directly from late The role of caveolae in EBOV entry remains unclear, and further studies are needed to show whether caveolae are involved or not in the EBOV entry [109, 110] . Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been implicated in EBOV entry [111, 112] .

This cleavage exposes a peptide that triggers fusion between the viral and host cell membrane [113] . The cleavage of GP into GP1 and GP2 by furin is dispensable both in vitro and in vivo and if blocked does not affect the infectivity of the virus. This has led to the conclusion that the furin-mediated cleavage of GP protein in virus-producing cells does not drive fusion, which is indeed driven by host endosomal cysteine proteases in the target cell [114] . Both cathepsin B (CatB) and cathepsin L (CatL) cysteine proteases were identified as host proteases involved in EBOV-GP processing [115] . Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that the cleavage in the loop connecting the base and the head of the GP1 subunit exposes the underlying GP2 fusion loop allowing it to function in the fusion process [86, 87] . It is possible that the cleavage of EBOV-GP by cysteine proteases unmasks the binding site for an unknown receptor, possibly NPC1, with a role in promoting fusion [86, 87] . The higher binding of CatL treated EBOV-GP pseudotyped virions to target cells supports this speculation [116] .",

Formalin-fixed or heat-inactivated virus-based vaccines were produced soon after the outbreak in 1976 to protect guinea pigs and non-human primates [84, 117] . However, the protection reported in both studies was inconsistent, and the elicited immune response was insufficient to protect baboons against lethal doses of EBOV. Several studies have shown tremendous efforts to develop subunit vaccines against EBOV since 1990. Earlier studies led to the conclusion that mice and guinea pigs are the most protected species, while non-human primates need to mount a more robust immune response to achieve protection [118] [119] [120] [121] . However, a study published in Nature showed that DNA-based immunization and boosting with adenoviral vectors, which encode viral proteins, generated cellular and humoral immunity in cynomolgus macaques that remained asymptomatic for more than 6 months, with no detectable virus after the initial challenge, while the unvaccinated animals died in less than a week [122] . The controversy in the results obtained from vaccine studies on non-human primates indicates that more extensive research is required to develop vaccines that provide complete protection against EBOV.",

A phase I clinical trial involving healthy volunteers was initiated in 2013-2014 but was quickly suspended due to adverse side effects [129] . However, later the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of TKM-Ebola in emergency situations. Several small molecule inhibitors of viral replication or entry were developed by different groups. Of the EBOV antivirals, favipiravir, also known as T-705 or Avigan, chemically defined as a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative and initially developed in Japan to treat influenza infection, is effective against a mouse model of EBOV infection [130] . Favipiravir showed inhibitory activity against influenza virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and foot and mouth disease virus in addition to flaviviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and alphaviruses [131] . Activity against enteroviruses and Rift Valley virus has also been documented [131, 132] . Favipiravir inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [133] . The adenosine nucleoside analog, BCX4430, is a broadspectrum antiviral drug initially developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals against hepatitis C and is currently tested against EBOV by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases [134] [135] [136] . BCX4430 shows efficacy against a wide range of other viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and flaviviruses [134] [135] [136] . BCX4430 protects against EBOV and MARV in both rodents and monkeys, even when administered up to 48 h post-infection [134] [135] [136] .

Drugs currently approved for other diseases inhibited EBOV in vitro and in animal models, for example, cationic amphiphiles (amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, clomiphene, and toremifene), Na + channel and Na + /K + exchange blockers (amiloride), Na + /K + ATPase inhibitors (digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain) [21, 22, 142] . A small molecule, 1E7-03, targeting the host cellular protein phosphatase 1, which controls EBOV VP30 dephosphorylation, inhibited EBOV replication in vitro [143] . AVI-7537, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer targeting the EBOV VP24 RNA transcript, is undergoing phase I clinical trial [144] . In addition, novel broad-spectrum antiviral small molecules that inhibited the entry of a wide range of viruses, including EBOV, by blocking CatL have been described in [16] . Other interventions include (i) recombinant human activated protein C (RhAPC) for the post-exposure treatment of EBOV infection in rhesus macaques and (ii) recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), a potent inhibitor of tissue factor initiated blood coagulation, which prolonged survival time in rhesus macaques challenged with EBOV lethal dose [145, 146] . Previously described efforts demonstrate that an anti-EBOV drug is within reach, and the EBOV epidemic may be under control in the near future ( Figure 3 ).",

Several studies have reported the development of passive immunotherapies in the form of antibodies and small molecule antivirals with inhibitory activities against EBOV infection in vitro and in animal models of infection [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] .

EBOV formerly known as Zaire Ebola virus is one of five ebolaviruses belonging to the genus Ebolavirus, while MARV is one of the two viruses belonging to the genus Marburgvirus [38-41]. It is important to note that transcriptional initiation and termination are also controlled by highly conserved motifs flanking the genes of the filovirus [42,43]. The individual gene transcriptional signals begin at the 3\u2032 end and terminate with a transcriptional termination (polyadenylation) site [36-38]. Transcription is terminated when the polymerase encounters a series of five to six uridines where the polymerase stops and adds a long poly-A tail to the transcripts [36-38]. The stability and level of transcripts are influenced by the long non-coding sequences at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the genome [37,38].",
