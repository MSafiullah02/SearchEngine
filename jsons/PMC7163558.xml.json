In the 2003 outbreak, the disease infected more than 8000 people, and killed more than 700 people [3]. Over 30% of the patients required high\u2010flow oxygen therapy; 20\u201336% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; and 13\u201326% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4, 5, 6, 7]. ARDS\u2010associated causes accounted for about 30% of deaths of the SARS patients in the ICU [8]. The high percentage of patients requiring special treatment/intensive care is a high burden to the medical system.

Previously, by using a study design avoiding systemic bias, we found that specific proteomic fingerprints, which were composed of 20 proteomic features, were present in the sera of adult SARS patients [13]. The fingerprints not only could differentiate SARS cases from non\u2010SARS cases with similar clinical features, but also separated patients into subgroups with different prognoses. These results suggest that some of the SARS\u2010associated proteomic features are potential prognostic markers. In this study, we examined the prognostic values of the individual SARS\u2010associated proteomic features by biostatistical analysis, and deciphered the identities of those with prognostic values. Platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta\u2010thromboglobulin (beta\u2010TG) were discovered to be potential markers of poor prognosis. These two CXC chemokines may play important roles in the development of ARDS in SARS patients.",

Briefly, the serum samples from the diseased and control groups were randomized and blinded to the investigator. CM10 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems) were used. Two binding conditions were used. One was performed at pH 4.0 while one was performed at pH 9.0. For each binding conditions, samples were analyzed in duplicate. For detailed procedure, please refer to the previous publication [13]. In order to avoid systemic bias, proteomic features were defined as SARS\u2010associated when meeting two criteria: (i) the normalized peak intensities had to be significantly higher/lower in SARS patients, compared to non\u2010SARS subjects; and (ii) the normalized peak intensities had to correlate with two or more clinical/biochemical parameters, indicating their biological meaningfulness. More than 800 common proteomic features were identified and compared between the SARS and non\u2010SARS patient groups. Twenty differential proteomic features were found to be significantly correlated with two or more clinical/biochemical parameters. As a result, there are 20 potential biomarkers for detection of SARS. Fifteen and five had higher and lower levels in the SARS patients, respectively. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that these 20 biomarkers contained information for identifying the SARS patients at high accuracy (sensitivity = 95%; specificity = 100%), and for separating the SARS patients with subgroups with various prognosis. Patients who required ICU care and/or supplemental oxygen during later treatment were significantly enriched in two clusters (p = 0.011). Among the studied SARS patients, the information of supplemental oxygen administration was only available for 38 cases. Therefore, patient information and proteomic datasets from these 38 cases were used in this study.",

CM10 ceramic beads (BioSepra, Ciphergen), which has the same weak anionic functional group as the CM10 ProteinChip arrays, was used in the experiment. Briefly, pooled serum samples were first denatured with U9 buffer and diluted with T4 or T9 sampling binding buffers, respectively. After 120\u2010min incubation and subsequent washing, the bound proteins were eluted from the CM10 ceramic beads with 1 M NaCl solution. C18 ZipTips were used to desalt the eluted proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The desalted protein preparations were spotted on the gold\u2010coated ProteinChip arrays, and examined with the ProteinChip reader to confirm that the purified proteins had the same mass as the targeted SELDI proteomic features. After confirmation, the purified proteins were resolved by 2DE in the absence of reducing chemicals to isolate spots with (i) apparent molecule weights corresponding to the SELDI proteomic features and with (ii) spot intensities showing the same differential patterns in the serum samples collected from the non\u2010SARS patients and the SARS patients with different prognoses, as previously described [12, 13, 14]. An immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strip (11cm 3\u201310 NL, Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was rehydrated with the sample overnight.

Second dimension SDS\u2010PAGE was performed on 4\u201312% Bris\u2010Tris polyacrylamide gels (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories) and the proteins were separated at 200 V for 40 min in ice bath. Proteins on gels were visualized either by colloidal blue (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) or silver staining (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Briefly, the gel pieces were destained, reduced with 1.75% DTT, alkylated with 350 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), and digested overnight with modified porcine trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI). The tryptic digest was harvested and cleaned up with C18 ZipTips (Millipore). The cleaned tryptic peptides were subjected to tandem MS analysis using the ABI 4700 MALDI\u2010TOF/TOF system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with \u03b1\u2010cyano 4\u2010hydroxy cinnamic acid as matrix. The MS/MS spectra were then processed with Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems, version 4.4). The spectra were subjected to Gaussian smoothing with filter width of 5 points, and the baselines were corrected with default settings. Peaks were detected using a signal to noise threshold of 15. The fragment masses and intensities of each MS/MS mass spectrum were subjected to online Mascot MS/MS ion search (http://www.matrixscience.com/) to obtain the protein identities. For the search parameters, one missed cleavage in trypsin digestion was allowed; partial oxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine, and iodoacetamide modification of cysteine residues were selected. The error tolerance values of the parent peptides and the MS/MS ion masses were 0.1 and 0.3 Da, respectively. A protein identification result was considered significant when the MS/MS ion profile matched a known protein in the NCBInr database with a p\u2010value <0.05.

Two microliters of the U9 denatured serum samples (equivalent to 0.67 \u03bcL of neat serum) were denatured again and reduced by boiling in reducing SDS sample loading buffer, and separated with precast SDS\u2010polyacrylamide gels (Bio\u2010Rad).

Because SARS has not recurred since its first outbreak, most of the research studies on pathogenesis of SARS have been based on the use of animal or cell line models [15]. This is one of the major reasons leading to our limited knowledge on SARS pathogenesis. Coronavirus can cause inflammation and damage in the lung. In severe cases, ARDS occurs during the acute phase of SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) infection, whereas diffuse alveolar damage occurs during the organizing phase. Both are considered as clinically devastating end\u2010stage lung diseases. Various studies have indicated that the SARS\u2010CoV can escape from induction of the antiviral type I interferons in tissue cells, while chemokines IP\u201010 or IL\u20108 are strongly upregulated in the infected cells [16]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the prognostic values of serum PF4 and beta\u2010TG in predicting the need of supplemental oxygen in the SARS patients. As both PF4 and beta\u2010TG are CXC chemokines involved in the modulation of immune response, the results of this study also provide novel insights on the pathogenesis of SARS.",

            "text": "PF4, also called CXCL4, is produced and secreted by various cell types, although previously it was believed that it was exclusively produced by platelets and megakaryocytes [17]. Biological functions of PF4 have not been fully understood. It has been shown to participate in various functions in the immune system, such as promoting interaction between neutrophils and endothelial cells [18], inhibiting T\u2010cell proliferation [19], etc. Beta\u2010TG was the first protein of the beta\u2010TG family to be described [20]. Members of beta\u2010TG family are CXC chemokines, comprising PBP, CTAP\u2010III, beta\u2010TG, and NAP\u20102. They are encoded by the same gene PPBP with variations in the number of N\u2010terminal amino acids [20]. CTAP\u2010III is considered as the precursor of beta\u2010TG and NAP\u20102. The function roles of beta\u2010TG have not been completely elucidated. Evidence has shown that members of the beta\u2010TG family have different abilities in neutrophil chemoattraction, stimulation of neutrophil adhesion, and transendothelial migration of neutrophils [21]. NAP\u20102, also called CXCL7, is the key and most potent member responsible for recruitment and activation of neutrophils [22]. Although both NAP\u20102 and IL\u20108 play important roles in neutrophil activation during inflammatory reactions, they act through different molecular pathways [23]. The functional relationship among IL\u20108, PF4, and beta\u2010TG is highly complex. On one hand, PF4 and beta\u2010TG family members have divergent roles in neutrophil regulation [20]. PF4 inhibits production of NAP\u20102 from its precursor CTAP\u2010III in both stimulated and unstimulated neutrophils and mast cells [24]. On the other hand, PF4 induces human natural killer cells to synthesize and release IL\u20108 [25]. Between 13% and 26% of the SARS patients developed ARDS [4, 5, 6, 7]. ARDS is regarded as the severe stage of acute lung injury. Inflammatory mediators play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS through recruitment and activation of neutrophils [26, 27]. High levels of beta\u2010TG and NAP\u20102 were found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with ARDS [28, 29]. Lower level of PF4 was also observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ARDS patients, although this difference was not statistically significant [28]. In view of the findings from the previous and current studies, we here postulate that increased beta\u2010TG and decreased PF4 levels may play important roles in the development of ARDS in the SARS patients.",

            "text": "PF4 and beta\u2010TG have been repeatedly reported to be biomarkers for various pathologies and conditions. An increased PF4 level in plasma is usually associated with an increase of beta\u2010TF. Conventionally, elevated plasma levels of plasma PF4 and beta\u2010TG are used as indicators of platelet activation. Increased plasma levels of both PF4 and beta\u2010TG have been proposed to be used as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for various kinds of diseases, such as diagnosis of megakaryoblastic leukemia [30], prediction of thrombotic complications in patients with artificial heart valves [31], prognosis of cerebral infarction [32, 33], etc. Moreover, it is not uncommon that plasma/serum proteomic profiling identified an alternated plasma/serum level of only either PF4 or beta\u2010TF level, but not both, as a potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker. For example, elevation of PF4 was associated with poor response to infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis [34]. Decreased PF4 level was associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [35], whereas decreased beta\u2010TG level was observed in patients with pancreatic cancer [36]. A parallel observation of decreased PF4 level and increased beta\u2010TG level in blood has not been reported until the present study on SARS. In ARDS, similar dysregulation pattern was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [28, 29]. Therefore, it is very likely that a combination of decreased PF4 level and increased beta\u2010TG level in blood is a specific indicator for poor prognosis in SARS.",

Two of them were identified as CXC chemokines, PF4, and beta\u2010TG. Decreased PF4 and increased beta\u2010TG in the pretreatment serum samples were associated with the need of supplemental oxygen in the later treatment period. Previous studies suggest that PF4 and beta\u2010TG may be involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS in a negative and positive way, respectively. Our results, hence, suggest that PF4 and beta\u2010TG may also play important roles in the development of ARDS in SARS patients.",
