The M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for use because almost all circulating seasonal A viruses, including H1N1pdm09, carry a S31N point mutation in the M2 gene that makes such influenza viruses resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n This has resulted in a heavy reliance on the NA inhibitors, licensed oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) and zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae). However, there are well\u2010characterized point mutations in the NA gene that are associated with reduced susceptibility to this class of drug. A single H275Y change in the NA of the seasonal H1N1 strain circulating from 2007 to 2009 was associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir, and there have been recent reports of the equivalent H275Y mutation in H1N1pdm09 viruses.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n Because H1N1 viruses with the H275Y marker have now been isolated from patients with no known exposure to NA inhibitors, there is concern that circulating influenza viruses with this characteristic will increase in prevalence, further reducing treatment options to drugs which retain activity against these mutant strains. The lack of drug options with different mechanisms of action that could be used alone or in combination has magnified the risk of widespread antiviral resistance developing to the limited treatment options currently available.",

Phase III clinical programs are ongoing for IV formulations of three different NA inhibitors, potentially supporting the currently unmet medical need to treat severely ill, hospitalized patients. In addition, T\u2010705 (favipiravir) has progressed to phase II clinical trials and a novel long\u2010lasting NA inhibitor (laninamivir) is entering phase II studies in the United States.\n22\n Furthermore, peramivir and laninamivir have been licensed in Japan and an NDA has been filed for favipiravir. Figure 1B also illustrates the plethora of new influenza antivirals with novel mechanisms of action in earlier stages of development in the United States These include therapeutics targeting viral proteins and others inhibiting virus replication by targeting host factors. Table 1 highlights some of these antivirals to illustrate the breadth of molecules and targets currently under development for treating influenza infection and disease. These include a small molecule, an anti\u2010sense oligonucleotide, a peptide and a monoclonal antibody inhibiting novel virus targets such as virus gene transcription (AVI\u20107100)\n23\n and virus entry/fusion (CR6261 and flufirvitide\u20103).\n24\n, \n25\n Two examples of drugs in Table 1 affecting host factors illustrate different modes of inhibiting virus replication. EV\u2010077 indirectly inhibits virus replication by inhibiting the increase of prostanoids associated with influenza virus infection.\n26\n Increased prostanoids impair the host\u2019s innate immune response, thus increasing virus replication. In contrast, nitazoxanide is believed to be an immunomodulatory agent directly stimulating the host\u2019s innate immune response.\n27\n Compounds targeting host factors also offer the potential for broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity. For instance, nitazoxanide which is currently licensed for the treatment of cryptosporidium or Giardia diarrhea, has been reported to inhibit adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus in cell culture assays.\n20\n\n",

The appearance of the H275Y NA mutation in seasonal H1N1 was a dramatic illustration of such vulnerability. Oseltamivir resistance in seasonal H1N1 viruses circulating in the United States shifted from <1% in the 2006/2007 season to >95% by the 2008/2009 Northern Hemisphere influenza season.\n9\n This rapid rise in resistance to oseltamivir, associated with the H275Y change in the NA, seemed to occur in the absence of significant drug pressure, indicating greater transmission fitness of the variant. While the equivalent H275Y change in the NA of the H1N1pdm09 virus has not yet become prominent among currently circulating strains of influenza, there are indications of increased resistance, with some US states reporting >5% resistance during the 2010/2011 season. Importantly, an increasing percentage of resistant isolates have not been associated with NA inhibitor treatment.\n28\n, \n29\n The appearance and increased prevalence of H275Y variants clearly demonstrates the potential for naturally occurring influenza viruses to become resistant to NA inhibitors. Therefore, the population as a whole cannot rely on newly circulating strains of influenza always being sensitive to oseltamivir or zanamivir.",

The US Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority has devoted over 450 million dollars to date to the advanced development of new antivirals to address unmet medical needs for treatment of severely ill, hospitalized patients and for long\u2010lasting therapeutics.\n31\n, \n32\n In addition, numerous novel therapeutic molecules with unique mechanisms of action are now in various stages of drug development. Successful development of these drugs to final regulatory approval will serve to broaden the arsenal for treating all age groups and special populations as well as to mitigate the risk of emerging resistance against any one antiviral therapy. In addition, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of using influenza drugs in combination, a strategy successfully demonstrated with HIV antivirals for increasing efficacy and reducing development of resistance. Antiviral drugs targeting host factors may also offer advantages by reducing opportunities for the virus to develop resistance. In addition, drugs targeting host factors may offer broad\u2010spectrum antiviral potential that could permit treatment of respiratory infections without first identifying the causative virus.
