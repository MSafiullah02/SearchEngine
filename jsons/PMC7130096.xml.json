            "text": "This study was performed on 24 blood samples collected from 10 cats grouped as follows (\nTable 1):Group 1:Four clinically healthy Persian cats living in an FCoV-endemic cattery of approximately 40 cats. The cattery was managed in order to provide physical separation of cats with specific problems (pregnancies, parturitions, infectious diseases, etc) while asymptomatic cats shared the same environment. Sporadic cases of FIP (1\u20134 per year) occurred in the cattery in past years, suggesting that the cattery might be considered endemically infected by FCoV. As in most cats living in this environment the colonisation of intestine by FCoVs may be cyclic (Addie and Jarrett 2001), these cats were sampled at intervals ranging from 1 to 3 months in order to assess the possible relationship between the cytokine pattern and the actual FCoV status. Specifically, five samples (T1\u2013T5) were collected from cats A and D and four samples were collected from cats B (which was not sampled at T4) and C (which was not sampled at T3). The intervals between samples were 90 days from T1 to T2, 35 days from T2 to T3 and from T3 to T4 and 70 days from T4 to T5. Cases of FIP occurred 12 days after sampling 3 and 30 days after sampling 5.Group 2:Three cats affected by FIP. One of them came from a Maine Coon breeding cattery, the others were two domestic shorthairs living in multi-cat households on which cases of FIP were recorded in the past. All these cats showed clinical signs consistent with FIP. They were sampled just before euthanasia, and then they were submitted for necropsy. In all these three cases, the clinical suspicion of FIP was confirmed by post-mortem examinations that included necropsy, histology and immunohistochemistry for FCoV-antigens, performed as already described (Paltrinieri et al 2003).Group 3:Three SPF cats permanently kept at the animal facility of the Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Zurich. At the time of sampling these cats were clinically healthy and did not show any haematological or biochemical abnormalities.\n",

Prior to cDNA synthesis, 1 \u03bcl of RNA from each sample was subjected to PCR analysis for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Samples that demonstrated a PCR product for GAPDH were considered to have genomic contamination and were subjected to a second DNase treatment (DNA-FREE, Ambion, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom) and re-checked for DNA contamination. All samples were negative for gDNA after the second DNase treatment. The synthesis of first-strand cDNA templates with oligodT (200 ng/\u03bcl) was carried out with a commercial kit (Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in a volume of 33 \u03bcl at 42\u00b0C for 50 min followed by inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 70\u00b0C for 15 min.

Twenty microlitres of each dilution were applied to each well and incubated (30 min, 37\u00b0C) in a humid chamber. Slides were then washed three times with PBS, dried, and 15 \u03bcl of FITC-conjugated rabbit-anti cat immunoglobulin (Nordic Immunological Laboratories, Tilburg, The Netherlands) were applied to each well. After incubation (30 min, 37\u00b0C in a humid chamber), the slides were washed, dried, coverslipped with PBS and Kaiser's glycerin (1:3 ratio) and observed on a fluorescence microscope. The dilutions which showed a clear fluorescence signal in about one half of the cells were judged as positive.

It has been reported that standard RT-PCR has the same reproducibility for relative quantification of mRNA as for other methods like competitive RT-PCR (Hall et al 1998). Finally, the use of specific software to calculate band intensity is an easy and frequently used method for semi-quantitative analysis of digitalised gel images (Harley et al., 1999, Yancy et al., 2001, Duvigneau et al., 2003). For these reasons we used a traditional RT-PCR technique to study cytokine profiles in feline whole blood and we quantified the bands' intensity by image analysis. This method allowed us to obtain repeatable and reliable results, thus indicating that it can be used to compare results from different test sessions. In order to correctly interpret the results, however, it is important to standardise some of the methodological factors: (1) time between blood collection and RNA extraction: it has been reported that cold storage of whole blood poorly affects the amount of RNA extracted, even though it might activate some cell populations (Duvigneau et al 2003); nevertheless standardisation of processing times would affect all the samples in a similar manner; (2) amount of cells used for RNA extraction: this must be done by counting white blood cells in whole blood and using an appropriate amount of blood for RNA extraction; (3) amount of cDNA used in the PCR reaction: using the semi-quantitative method, the number of RNA copies in each band is unknown, but, based on the results of normalisation with GAPDH, the same amount of cDNA was loaded in each PCR reaction and, as an image calibrator was included in each gel, the relative amount of cytokines expressed in different samplings, in different batches of tests or in different groups of cats, can be compared to each other, as was the case in this study.",

The use of SPF cats as a negative control might appear unusual as the immune system of these cats is exposed to stimuli (non-specific infectious agents, environmental stress) different from those of non-SPF cats. On the other hand, the few data available regarding feline cytokines have been recorded in SPF cats (Rottman et al., 1995, Kipar et al., 2001). Moreover, a control group composed by FCoV-negative non-SPF cats from FCoV-negative multi-cat households would have been a better control group, but it would not represent a frequent situation, in practice: only a low proportion of multi-cat households (less than 10% in our area) can be actually considered FCoV-negative, while the percentage of FCoV-infected animals in the large majority of catteries is close to 100% (Pedersen 1995). In group 1, we found both persistent and recurrent shedders with fluctuating antibody titres, as already reported in FCoV-endemic catteries (Addie and Jarrett 2001), and post-mortem findings of cats from group 2 were consistent with FIP. The sampled population can thus be considered a good sample for studying naturally occurring FCoV\u2013host interactions.",

This is in agreement with the increases of certain lymphocyte subsets and acute phase proteins (Paltrinieri et al., 2003, Giordano et al., 2004), which might depend on the expression of the above cytokines, in cats that remain healthy when other cats of the cattery develop FIP. The positive correlation between IFN-\u03b3 expression and lymphocyte percentage might depend on the fact that non-symptomatic FCoV-infected cats have high numbers of CD8+ lymphocytes (Paltrinieri et al 2003), which can produce high levels of IFN-\u03b3 (Caruso et al 1998). All these findings suggest that an intense cytokine production by peripheral blood cells, and specifically an increased expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, might protect FCoV-infected cats from FIP (Kiss et al 2004). Ultimately, FIP occurs when low pathogenic FCoV strains mutate and acquire the ability to replicate within macrophages, but the probability of mutation depends on the rate of replication of enteric FCoVs (Vennema et al 1998). It is thus possible that viral replication is lower in cats that mount an efficient immunity.",

By contrast, the cytokine profiles of cats F and G, which had the wet form, were quite silent: both these cats expressed only low levels of IL-1\u03b2 and cat F also expressed IL-6. A decreased cytokine expression was already reported, in blood, during experimental infections (Gunn-Moore et al 1998), but it is in contrast with that recorded in tissues (Dean et al., 2003, Foley et al., 2003) and in ascites, on which high levels of IL-6 were recorded (Goitsuka et al 1990). Interestingly, all the cats with FIP had low or absent IFN-\u03b3 expression. Also IFN-\u03b3 has been found to be upregulated within lesions (Foley et al., 2003, Berg et al., 2005), but downregulated in blood of cats with FIP (Kiss et al 2004). Cytokine profiles in blood therefore seem to be different from those in tissues of cats with FIP. Moreover, the low levels of IFN-\u03b3 recorded in cats with FIP compared with the high levels recorded in FCoV-positive clinically healthy cats supports the hypothesis raised by Kiss et al (2004) about the key role of this molecule in predisposing to or in protecting from FIP.",

The semi-quantitative approach based on the analysis of digitalised gel images provides repeatable results. As the analysis of whole blood is considered to be highly representative of the in vivo situation, our results further support the hypothesis that upregulation of cytokines by blood cells might protect FCoV-infected cats from FIP, while downregulation of cytokines (and especially of IFN-\u03b3) is associated with FIP. These results must be verified by larger and well controlled studies to investigate both the role of cytokines in FCoV\u2013host interactions and the possibility to use cytokine profiles to identify cats susceptible or resistant to FIP.",
