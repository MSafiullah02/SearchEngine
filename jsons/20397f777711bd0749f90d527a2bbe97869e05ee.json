HCT recipients appeared to be more affected than patients with HM. Although respiratory copathogens were frequently detected, the clinical outcomes of these patients were similar to those without copathogens. The mortality rate of HCT recipients by day 90 after developing HCoV LRTD was similar to rates seen with established respiratory pathogens including RSV, influenza virus, and PIV ( Figure 3 and Table 6 ) [16] [17] [18] . All 4 HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples regardless of the presence of copathogens, and at least 2 HCoV strains were present nearly half of the year. SARS and MERS are recognized as highly human-pathogenic coronaviruses, causing acute, severe, frequently fatal LRTD [20] [21] [22] . Although 4 other strains of HCoV (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are also human pathogens, the clinical impact of HCoV LRTD remains unclear, especially in immunocompromised patients [4, 14, 23] . A previous prospective study with weekly nasal surveillance sampling during the first 100 days after HCT demonstrated prolonged HCoV shedding in the upper respiratory tract (>3 weeks) in half of subjects including asymptomatic patients [8] . In addition, respiratory copathogens were identified in more than half the episodes in this study (57%). Given the prolonged asymptomatic shedding and frequent detection of respiratory copathogens, attributing poor clinical outcomes to HCoV in the lower respiratory tract may be difficult. In the current study, follow-up BAL procedures were not performed to assess prolonged shedding in the lower respiratory tract; however, a prior study that included only 4 patients with cancer demonstrated that only 1 of 10 cases had HCoV detected in follow-up BAL specimens, arguing against asymptomatic prolonged shedding in the lower respiratory tract [14] . More data are needed to define shedding duration in the immunocompromised population. In our study, clinical outcomes including intensity of respiratory support, days alive without hospitalization, and mortality were not significantly different between patients with and without other copathogens, suggesting that HCoV in the lower respiratory tract can contribute to severity of LRTD regardless of copathogens. Lung tissue from 1 patient was positive for HCoV by RT-PCR.

Given the common perception of HCoV as a relatively benign pathogen based on limited data [5, 8] , our data are somewhat surprising. The adverse impact of oxygen requirement at the time of diagnosis on subsequent clinical outcome has been suggested [16, 24] . Once substantial acute lung injury occurs, clinical outcome can potentially be affected by inflammation rather than virus itself. Therefore, mortality rates by day 90 following LRTD caused by HCoV, RSV, influenza virus, and PIV were also compared according to oxygen requirement at the time of LRTD diagnosis; no statistically significant difference was found. These data combined suggest that HCoV LRTD is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome in this immunocompromised population. Previous studies, mainly in immunocompetent hosts, have not demonstrated a distinct association between particular HCoV strains in upper respiratory tract samples and disease severity in LRTD [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Although there are case reports with each strain identified in lower respiratory tract as a sole pathogen in HCT recipients, systematic data are limited [9] [10] [11] [12] . This is the first study to describe that all 4 HCoV strains can be detected in BAL samples with and without any other respiratory copathogens in a large immunocompromised population.

Because this may in part be due to the fact our cohort included some patients who were transplanted prior to the introduction of routine HCoV PCR testing, we separately analyzed patients who underwent transplantation after introduction of a respiratory viral PCR panel in 2006 and determined the median time of diagnosis remained similar (340 days). The majority of patients who developed HCoV LRTD >100 days following transplant had received either chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy as predisposing factors. This does not explain why there is a relatively lower incidence of HCoV LRTD early after transplant.

Thus, we conclude that HCoV appears to be a significant respiratory pathogen in the populations studied. This is an important observation because HCoVs are highly prevalent in immunocompromised hosts. The appreciation of HCoV as an important lower respiratory tract pathogen could impact clinical management including risk stratification in future studies and provide a rationale to develop antiviral therapies. Further studies are needed to clarify if particular HCoV strains and viral load are correlated with clinical outcome and to identify risk factors for progression to LRTD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.
