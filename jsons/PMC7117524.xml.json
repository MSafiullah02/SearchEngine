Some virus infections cause SGs and the formation of SGs is considered as an indication of an antiviral innate response that limits translation of the viral genes (Onomoto et al., 2014). Many viruses have evolved strategies to overcome the antiviral effect of SGs by degrading or sequestering its key components such as G3BP1 or TIA-1/TIAR to prevent the formation of SGs (Emara and Brinton, 2007; Humoud et al., 2016; Le Sage et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2016; White et al., 2007; White and Lloyd, 2011). The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus (IAV) inhibits eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation mediated SGs by blocking PKR activation (Khaperskyy et al., 2012). Some viruses have been reported to benefit from SGs formation. For instance, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication was impaired in cells with a reduced level of G3BP1 expression (Lindquist et al., 2010).",

Here we observed that while knockdown of G3BP1 enhanced PEDV replication, overexpression of G3BP1 reduced PEDV replication in Vero cells. Our data suggested an antiviral role of G3BP1 against PEDV. Similar observations were reported for other viruses including mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) (Choudhury et al., 2017) and sindbis virus (Cristea et al., 2010). G3BP1 appeared to play no role in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication (Catanzaro and Meng, 2019; Zhou et al., 2017). A pro-viral role of G3BP1 in hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (Garaigorta et al., 2012), chikungunya virus (Scholte et al., 2015), and respiratory syncytial virus (Lindquist et al., 2010) has been reported.",

We observed that PEDV\u2212CO induced SGs as early as 12 h after infection. Approximately 35% PEDV infected Vero-76 cells exhibited two or more SGs at 24 and 48 h of infection. This is in contrast to poliovirus, which causes transient SG formation during the early phase of infection and disperse SGs by cleavage of G3BP1 during later stages of infection (White et al., 2007). We did not observe any cleavage products of G3BP1 during PEDV infection (data not shown). RSV triggers stable SG formation throughout the viral replication cycle (Lindquist et al., 2010). Cells infected with Mengovirus or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), which belong to the Cardiovirus genus within the family of Picornaviridae, do not exhibit SGs because the viral nonstructural protein, leader (L) protein inhibits SGs (Borghese and Michiels, 2011). Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), a member of Coronaviridae, induced SG formation early in infection (Raaben et al., 2007; Sola et al., 2011). The percentages of SG positive cells increases as PRRSV infection progresses, suggesting that PRRSV induces stable SGs (Catanzaro and Meng, 2019; Zhou et al., 2017).",

Since virus infections typically induce both ROS and antioxidant response simultaneously (Basu et al., 2017), it is reasonable to speculate that activation of antioxidant pathway by PEDV may mediate the inhibition of SGs induced by AS treatment.

A previous study has shown that knockdown of SG markers such as G3BP1 increased NF-\u03baB activation and transcription of proinflammatory cytokines induced by PRRSV, which seems to be independent of virus replication (Zhou et al., 2017). The detailed mechanisms by which G3BP1 knockdown affects virus induced proinflammatory cytokines remain to be determined. One limitation of the study is that we used Vero-76 cells, which are not the natural host cells for PEDV.
