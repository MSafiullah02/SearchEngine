            "text": "Cruise tourism has witnessed substantial growth in the tourism market over the last few decades. From 1980 to 2014, the annual growth rate of cruise passengers was 7.2% (FCCA, 2015), where 22.1 million passengers enjoyed cruise travel in 2014 alone. The future of the industry is also encouraging. According to Cruise Market Watch, the number of passengers are projected to grow to 25 million in 2019 with an average growth rate of 4.5%. Although cruise tourism comprises only a fraction of the total tourism industry, whose total revenue amounted to $ 40 billion in 2015, the per capita expenditure of cruise passengers is more than double the amount of general tourists; in 2014, each passenger paid nearly $ 1797 to cruise lines for their service while other general tourists spent $ 830 (UNWTO, 2015). The substantial spending of cruise passengers, together with the high growth rates indicate that the cruise industry has great market potential. Therefore, policy makers and researchers have paid close attention to the economic impacts of cruise tourism at the national or regional level (Braun et al., 2002, Dwyer et al., 2004, Chang et al., 2016b, Dwyer and Forsyth, 1998).",

            "text": "Cruise Market Watch reports several key statistics that characterize the cruise industry. For one thing, the industry is dominated by three major cruise lines. Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL) is the leader in the global market. In 2015, it carried 48.1% of passengers and collected 42.4% of revenue in the industry. Royal Caribbean Ltd. (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) come next with the passenger and revenue share being 23.1% and 22.1%, and 10.4% and 12.4%, respectively. The oligopolistic market structure is rooted from two factors: the enormous fixed costs required in cruise line operation and the high entry barrier (Papatheodorou, 2006). First, potential entrants should purchase cruise ships to operate, which costs almost a billion dollars per ship. To recover the fixed costs, entrants need to build a substantial customer base. Second, it is not easy for new comers to establish a passenger base due to brand-awareness and reputation effects, meaning that cruise passengers tend to prefer well-established cruise lines to reduce their risk of travel involving high expenditure.",

On the other hand, this is not always true when looking into the performance of the lines. Table 1\npresents a snapshot of financial statements of the major cruise lines. All three lines have performed well in generating their revenues, but showed different outcomes in making their net incomes. Together with implementing a well-planned operation, cruise companies need to leverage their profits through appropriate financial strategies. A failure in financial strategies, e.g., hedging and capital investment, can decrease the final returns substantially even when sales and physical operation are successful. The variations in their performance in the table may have been affected by divergent business strategies in operation and financial management. Therefore, an interesting research question arises; if cruise lines are efficient in both operational and financial management, and if not, which part caused the inefficiency?",

Other than cruise lines, a variety of tourism units have been analyzed in the tourism literature to determine if their operation was efficient, e.g., hotels (Barros, 2005, Hwang and Chang, 2003), resorts (Goncalves, 2013), and travel agencies (Fuentes, 2011). These studies applied a widely used method, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) proposed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) (henceforth, CCR model). DEA is a programming-based method to gauge the performance of organizational units in relation to their peers. The main advantage of DEA is that it does not require a production function and can handle multiple inputs and outputs. This attractive feature has made DEA pervasive among researchers.",

            "text": "The DEA models used in tourism papers assumed predominantly that the inputs were converted to outputs via a single production process. On the other hand, this may misrepresent many cases including cruise line operation. For example, cruise lines initially attempt to induce as many passengers as possible to generate ticket and ancillary revenues. This process is followed by profit generation, which is related to the cruise lines' efforts to maximize the net income out of their revenue. In this case, at least two stages of the production process are involved in cruise line operation, i.e. operational and financial. Therefore, traditional DEA models with a single process used in existing works of the tourism literature are inadequate to analyze the operational procedures. Rather, it can be modelled more properly by the network DEA, which originated from F\u00e4re and Grosskopf (1996). Network DEA models are advantageous when evaluating a multi-level production process. Yu and Lee (2009) and Hsieh and Lin (2010)s application of a network DEA model to the hotel industry showed that the model has potential merits in evaluating the tourism units by enabling a sophisticated depiction of its operation.",

The operating income earned at this stage flows into the \u201cnon-operational\u201d stage, where the cruise lines obtain profits.

Weaver (2005) made a deep look into the cruise operation from \u201cMcdonaldization\u201d perspective. He argued that essential indicators of Mcdonaldization were observed in the cruise industry, which are efficiency, calculability, predictability, and irrationality of rationality. However, he contended that inherent risk in cruise operation, e.g., safety and weather condition, and service differentiation within a ship or across cruise lines go against the pattern of Mcdonaldization. Ladany and Arbel (1991) proposed a revenue management model for cruise lines to determine the optimal number of market segments and the pricing policy. To this end, passenger demand was assumed to be linear, and the equal number of market segment was considered to simplify the model. Ji and Mazzarella (2007) validated two frequently used revenue management models, which are modified nested class allocation model and dynamic class allocation model. Sun, Gauri, and Webster (2011) applied numerous forecasting methods to identify the most suitable forecasting models for revenue management of cruise lines. Their finding suggests that revenue management forecasting for hotel industry is not necessarily applicable to the cruise industry. Wie (2005) derived the optimal capacity investment of cruise lines when they provide homogeneous service in an oligopolistic market.",

Checking the relationship between major loyalty constructs, the authors found that cognitive, affective, and conative loyalties are sufficient to explain behavioral loyalty. The question of \u201cwhy people cruise\u201d was addressed by Hung and Petrick (2011). They showed that cruise motivation could be categorized into four dimensions, which are self-esteem/social recognition, escape/relaxation, learning/discovery/thrill, and bonding. Hyun and Han (2013) studied the effect of \u201cother passengers' perception\u201d on a passenger's social value, brand attachment, and willingness to pay a price premium. Their results suggest that the significant effect of other passengers' perception influence social value, and brand attachment. In addition, a mediating relationship of brand attachment on willingness to pay a price premium was identified. Chang, Liu, Park, and Roh (2016a) examined the determinants of cruise passengers' satisfaction. After surveying passengers before and after their trips, they inferred that satisfaction and revisit-intention were mainly explained by cruise travelers' experience on site rather than the gap between expectation and real experience.",

Hwang and Chang (2003) used the CCR model and Malmquist Productivity Index to analyze the performance of Taiwanese hotels. They measured the change in the managerial efficiency of the hotels over time and found a link between efficiency and strategy formulation. Barros (2005) evaluated the performance of Portuguese hotels using the input-oriented CCR model. He showed that the economies of scale and location were major factors that determined the hotel efficiency. The same model was used in K\u00f6ksal and Aksu (2007), who assessed the A-Group travel agencies in Turkey. They found an insignificant difference in efficiency between the agencies operating independently and the ones operating under a chain brand. Barros, Botti, Peypoch, Robinot, and Solonandrasana (2011) identified the key determinants of efficiency in French tourist destinations. Initially, they ran an output-oriented CCR model to measure the efficiency, which was followed by the bootstrapped-truncated regression of the tourist attraction features on the efficiency. Their results suggested that beach endowments, the presence of theme parks, monuments, museums, ski resorts, and natural parks improved efficiency. In their analysis of Italian tourist regions, Bosetti, Cassinelli, and Lanza (2007) calculated the Malmquist Productivity Index to gauge the technological and efficiency change of the regions over time. They incorporated the variables related to the environment as well as tourism service provision, claiming that the tourism regions should minimize their environmental effects to maintain competitiveness.",

The first stage, \u201coperating process\u201d, refers to the revenue-generating activities of the firms. In particular, payroll, operating, and administrative expenses, and depreciation turned out to be the major input variables in producing the outputs, such as ticket and onboard revenues and operating income. The payroll and related expenses are the payments for shipboard personnel, officers, deck and engine crew, and hotel and administrative employees. The payroll was separated from overall operating expenses to reflect the degree of customer service on board ship, e.g., more payroll implies the employment of more crewmembers, which improves the service quality (Teye & Leclerc, 1998). Administrative expenses contain marketing, sales, and administration activity expenses, which are generated mainly via the shore side operation. Depreciation is allocated generally over the 30-year economic life span of the asset. The other operating expenses include the cost of passenger bookings, transportation expenses, commissions of travel agents, fees, taxes, and other charges. Ticket revenues comprise the sales of passenger tickets, and the air transportation to or from ships. A ticket price generally includes meals, accommodation, onboard entertainment, and some non-alcoholic beverages.

The former is closely associated with the firms sales activities while the latter with financial strategies, such as hedging, taxation, and investment.",

At a specific stage, k, individual cruise line o uses a combination of inputs xok=(x1ok,x2ok,...,xiok) to produce the network outputs yok=(y1ok,y2ok,...,yrok). Both stages are connected through intermediate outputs z\no=(z\n1o,z\n2o,...,z\nwo), which serve as outputs for stage 1 and as inputs for stage 2. The efficiency of a cruise line can be measured using the following linear program:minimize\u03c1o=1\u2212\u2211k=1K\u2211i=1mkwksik\u2212mkxiok1+\u2211k=1K\u2211r=1rkwksrk+rkyrok\n(1)subjectto\u2211j=1n\u03bbjkxijk=xiok\u2212sik\u2212,i\u2208Ik,\u2200k,\n(2)\u2211j=1n\u03bbjkyrjk=yrok+srk+,r\u2208Rk,\u2200k,\n(3)\u2211j=1n\u03bbj1zwjo=\u2211j=1n\u03bbj2zwjo,w\u2208W,\n(4)\u2211j=1n\u03bbjk=1,\u2200k,\n\u03bbjk\u22650,\u2200k,j,\nsik\u2212\u22650,\u2200k,i,\nsrk+\u22650,\u2200k,r,where \u03bbjk is a weight that indicates how much a cruise line o benchmarks another cruise line j. I\nk, R\nk, and W are the set of inputs, outputs and intermediate outputs at stage k, respectively. w\nk represents the importance of stage k\n(w1+w2=1), m\nk is the number of inputs. r\nk is the number of outputs, and \u03c1o\u2208[0,1] the efficiency score of cruise line o. The objective function fully identifies the slacks of inputs and outputs in the numerator and denominator, respectively. The nonlinear objective function should be solved by the fractional programming method, whose detailed procedure is explained by Tone, 2001, Tone and Tsutsui, 2009. Among the constraints, (1) expresses that cruise line o can reduce its input level by sik\u2212 compared to the best practice level +j=1n\u03bbjkxijk. Similarly, (2) shows that the cruise line o has potential to increase output by srk+. Constraint (3) is a newly incorporated component into the network DEA, which states that the intermediate output produced at the first stage directly flows to the second stage. In other words, the intermediate outputs are not added or lost when they are moved through the stages. Eq. (4) imposes the variable returns-to-scale assumption of the cruise line operation.",

            "text": "To find the determining factors on cruise efficiency, a regression model is used. Numerous existent papers (Barros, 2004, Chang et al., 2016c, Gillen and Lall, 1997, Zou et al., 2015) applied Tobit regression for this purpose, which assumes a censored normal distribution, for efficiency scores are one at best. Simar and Wilson (2007), however, argued that the application of Tobit regression is erroneous because it ignores the data generating process (DGP) of observed variables. Specifically, \u201cenvironmental variables (or contextual variables)\u201d affect firms inherent efficiency, which in turn are realized as input and output levels. This can be mathematically expressed as,(7)f(xi,\u03b7i,\u03b4i,zi)=f(xi,\u03b7i|\u03b4i,zi)f(\u03b4i,zi)f(zi),where f(\u22c5) is the probability density function of drawing observations, x\ni is the vector of observed inputs, \u03b7\ni the reparametrized output vector, \u03b4\ni the true unknown efficiency, z\ni the matrix of determinants that affect firms' performance. Subscript i denotes a specific firm. Note that the right-hand side represents the logical sequence of the DGP: the probability of inspecting observed inputs and outputs is conditioned on efficiency and environmental variables, with the latter being the ultimate precursor. DEA measurement, however, follows the sequence of the DGP inversely: observed inputs and outputs are used to calculate efficiency, and the effects of environmental variables on the efficiency are estimated by regression. To see this, let the true model of efficiency-determinants relationship specified as \u03b4\ni=z\ni\n\u03b2+\u03b5\ni, where \u03b2 is the vector of marginal determinant effects and \u03b5\ni an error term. If DEA efficiency score is used with Tobit regression, it leads to(8)\u03b4i=\u03b4\u02c6i\u2212Bias(\u03b4\u02c6i)\u2212ui=zi\u03b2+\u03b5i\u2192\u03b4\u02c6i=zi\u03b2+\u03b5i+Bias(\u03b4\u02c6i)+ui.\nBias(\u03b4\u02c6i)=E(\u03b4\u02c6i)\u2212\u03b4i is the difference between the calculated efficiency \u03b4\u02c6i and the unknown true efficiency \u03b4\ni. Bias(\u03b4\u02c6i) can be regarded as a noise stemming from DGP. u\ni is an additional error term. Eq. (8) suggests that Tobit regression abandons Bias(\u03b4\u02c6)+ui terms, which may vanish asymptotically but produces inefficient and less reliable estimates.",

Economic shock is the indicator variable that takes value \u20181\u2019 for observations in year 2004, 2012, and 2013 while having value \u20180\u2019 for other observations. These are periods when the cruise lines could have been affected by economic crises, e.g., oil shock in 2004; sub-prime mortgage shock in 2009; recession in Spain and Italy in 2012; and Euro zone crisis in 2013. Likewise, Epidemic is the indicator variable where value \u20181\u2019 is assigned for observations in 2003 and 2009 and \u20180\u2019 for the rest of observations. This is to represent the negative impacts of epidemic disease, e.g., SARS in 2003 and Mexico flu in 2009. The last indicator variable is Other accidents, where \u20181\u2019 is encoded for years 2001, 2003, and 2012. Disastrous accidents happened in these periods: September 11 attack in 2001; the breakout of Iraq War in 2003; and the capsizing of Costa Concordia (2012). PPP is the valuation of GDP in 37 advanced countries scaled by their purchasing power. Total debt to capital is the ratio of total debts to capital in financial statements, where the total debt is the sum of both short-term and long-term debts, and the capital indicates the aggregate value of the total debt and shareholder equity. An additional variable, Payroll, which is total expenses on wages, is included to control the effects of cruise lines' size.",

The infectious nature of the disease deterred cruise travel as people avoided the heavily crowded area. Second, an outbreak of Mexico Flu in mid-North America in 2009 also struck the cruise industry. The region had the largest cruise market in the world, so cruise lines must have suffered from a tremendous reduction in travel by the flu.

This could have been attributed to their hedging policy. RCL and CCL actively hedged against fuel costs, interest rates, and exchange rates while NCL failed to do so (This was officially stated in the annual report of NCL in 2006). The failure intensified NCL's already massive debt when the interest rate escalated. Indeed, in December 31, 2006, NCL had $2.6 billion of total debt, of which $154.6 million was the portion of long-term borrowings, which were mostly incurred to finance ship construction. In the same year, the LIBOR and EURIBOR rate increased by 1%, increasing their burdens of debt payment. For this reason, NCL recorded huge foreign currency translation losses, e.g., total losses of $ 25.3 million throughout 2002\u20132006. In addition, NCL had to bear substantial impairment losses occurring in 2008 due to the cancellation of a shipbuilding contract. Overall, NCL's neglecting the hedging strategies and the sudden cancellation of a shipbuilding contract largely contributed to the negative net income of NCL for 2003\u20132008. This explains NCL's exceptionally low non-operating efficiency score compared to RCL.",

In the specification, cruise lines generate ticket revenue, other revenues, and operating income from their labor and capital resources at the operating stage. The operating income flows directly into the non-operating stage, which is closely associated with the financial activities of cruise lines that plow profits (net incomes) out of the operating income.

Their operation, however, was prone to epidemics as evidenced in tourism literature (Baxter and Bowen, 2004, Cooper, 2006). Next, the operating efficiency improved during economic crisis because cruise lines reduced their operating costs significantly. This interesting point is new in tourism literature, as existing studies (Papatheodorou et al., 2010, Smeral, 2010, Song and Lin, 2010) only highlighted indicators such as tourist counts. Another finding is that the non-operating efficiency of cruise lines varied widely, most likely due to their different financial strategies. Aggressive market followers, such as RCL and NCL, recorded low efficiency at the non-operating stage because of their high debt ratio, which put severe pressure on debt payments. This finding is similar to financial efficiency patterns in the other fields (Pires and Fernandes, 2012; Beck et al., 2013). In addition, though implicative, hedging strategies could also have affected the non-operational efficiency. For example, RCL and NCL adopted similar financial strategies in terms of the debt to capital ratio, but the non-operating efficiency of NCL was significantly different. This is because NCL failed to hedge against the interest rate and exchange rate, making it vulnerable to financial downturns. It is also noteworthy to see that economic downturn had detrimental effect on non-operating efficiency in general. Investment and capital utilization affected cruise lines net income critically, and even rigorous restructuring of operation could not make up for them.",

            "text": "This paper provides several managerial implications. First, epidemics affects the cruise lines' sales operation. To mitigate potential travelers' concerns on diseases, cruise lines need to ensure passengers that their service is clean and secure from epidemics. Media advertisement can be an effective tool to relieve potential travelers' worries. In addition, it would be helpful for cruise lines to reposition current operating routes to avoid tourist attractions labelled as \u201cepidemic zone.\u201d The second implication is that cruise lines should prepare themselves for economic downturn, which poses great threat to earning net income. One way to cope with the shock is hedging. Active hedging against fuel costs (which accounts for the majority of operating costs) and insurance on idle capacity would be essential. Decision-makers should be aware that presumably wasteful spending on hedging in normal times can minimize significant loss during economic downturn. Another critical point is the capital investment. This strategy is essential for cruise lines to increase market share in the long run. The resulting debt burdens, however, can hurt the financial health of expanding cruise lines, leading to reduced net income and dividends for shareholders (note that NCL's main source of non-operating inefficiency is high debt-to-capital ratio, which must have been mainly caused by aggressive capital investment). This can make investors hesitant to further investment, which in turn would increase the debt financing again. Hence, capital investment should be calculated by examining its negative impacts. When investing capital by debt financing, cruise lines should not hesitate to hedge against interest rate, fuel price, foreign currency, and other available hedging mechanisms. This would enable cruise lines to avoid sudden increases in liability (if interest rate gets high) and avoid the postponement of debt payment when the market condition is unfavorable.",

First, if detailed information on hedging strategy of cruise lines becomes available, we can formally estimate the relationship between hedging and non-operating efficiency more quantitatively. Second, one can develop alternative network structures and recalculate the efficiency scores using other types of input and output sets. In this way, we can check whether the efficiency ranking among cruise lines are robust. Third, one can use dynamic DEA models to incorporate the inter-temporal influences between the years. Furthermore, since DEA efficiency measures are deterministic, some authors employed \u201cbootstrapping\u201d to draw confidence intervals for efficiency scores (Nguyen et al., 2016, Wanke and Barros, 2016). The method would be beneficial in checking the robustness of DEA results in future research. Lastly, researchers can improve the method of handling negative output data, rather than substituting negative values by scaling down positive output values among observations, which this paper employed. To this end, researchers need to develop a network DEA model that captures the negativity of data in measuring inefficiency.",
