However, the clinical symptoms of an influenza infection are difficult to distinguish from infections with other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3), adenovirus (HAdV), coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1), metapneumovirus (HMPV), and rhinovirus (HRV). Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish these infections to monitor influenza epidemiology and vaccine efficacy.",

The detection of HRV in 17% of samples may be an underestimate as more than 100 serotypes exist [Kennedy et al., 2012] and a single primer set may not be sufficient to amplify all of the existing variations. However, the frequent detection of this virus in the respiratory tracts of healthy people make it difficult to determine the etiological role it plays in influenza-like-illness and lower respiratory tract infections as many studies that have compared the detection rate of HRV between patients with influenza-like-illness and healthy controls have not found a significant difference between the two groups [Buecher et al., 2010; Chidlow et al., 2012] . Nevertheless, the upper respiratory carriage of HRV may contribute to a greater susceptibility to influenza-like-illness and acute lower respiratory tract infections [Papadopoulos, 2004] .",

Seasonal influenza vaccination is very rare in Papua New Guinea, so this is unlikely to have any bearing on the detection rate of these viruses in this population. Outbreaks of influenza have had a major impact on Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations in the past. The isolation of many communities and the contribution of poverty, high bacterial carriage and poor access to health services have led to significant mortalities in indigenous populations [Kelso and Reading, 2010] . The samples analyzed in this study were collected closely following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. All of the influenza A strains that were further subtyped (n \u00bc 25) were confirmed as A/H1N1pdm09 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza Surveillance and Research, Melbourne Australia (data not shown). The majority of the PNG population most likely had very low immunity to this virus and therefore the rates of influenza A may have been higher during this period than at other times.",

The higher detection rates of HAdV [Langley, 2005] and HRSV [Hombrouck et al., 2012; Huo et al., 2012] in children <5 years of age has been reported previously. In particular, HRSV is accepted as the most important cause of viral lower respiratory tract disease in young children [Leung et al., 2005] . Nair et al. [2010] estimated that HRSV caused 66,000-199,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age in 2005, and 99% of these deaths were in developing countries. HAdV can be associated with respiratory illnesses throughout all age groups, but most commonly in young infants or school aged children. By age 5 almost 75% of children have serological evidence of adenovirus infection [Langley, 2005] . The detection of influenza B at significantly higher rates in young children has not been reported extensively [Peltola et al., 2003] . Previous studies have suggested that influenza B may cause less severe illness in adults due to partial immunity elicited to previously circulating strains of influenza B virus [Glezen et al., 1980; Newland et al., 2006] .",

The majority of the morbidity and mortality due to respiratory infections worldwide is in children <5 years of age. The lower immunity of young children to respiratory viruses undoubtedly plays an important role as these viruses can lead to disruption of the innate immunity of the respiratory tract and thus lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia and other acute lower respiratory infections [Vareille et al., 2011] . This study also found a significantly higher rate of co-infections in young children when compare to the rest of the population. Numerous studies have found that co-infections with respiratory viruses may lead to more severe respiratory illnesses [Cilla et al., 2008; Esposito et al., 2008; Richard et al., 2008] ; conversely other studies have observed no such effect [Peng et al., 2009; Suryadevara et al., 2011] . In this study, no data were collected on the severity of influenza-like-illness and therefore we cannot comment on this matter. Influenza A and HRV were the viruses that were most commonly associated with coinfections with other respiratory viruses. This is probably not surprising considering they were the two viruses which were detected most commonly in the study.",
