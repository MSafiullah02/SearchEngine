Except for a history of mastitis, she had no history of other specific diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, or any heart diseases nor had any traumatic injuries. The patient exhibited a clear consciousness, with the blood pressure of 107/60 mm Hg, and a pulse rate of 60 beats/min. Her oxygen saturation was only 72%, even after applying an oxygen mask. An immediate noninvasive ventilator was applied with other symptom-directed treatments.",

There was interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion and bronchiectasis. The adjacent pleura showed reactive thickening, without mediastinal lymphadenopathy. According to a scoring method published in the literature (2), the total lung severity score of the patient was 19 out of 20. Besides, we found pneumatosis extending from the mediastinal pericardium to the bilateral cervical soft tissue space (Fig. 1A\u2013D). The patient was considered to have spontaneous pneumomediastinum because no other sources of mediastinal air could be identified. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is uncommon in virus pneumonia. It was reported in cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus pneumonia (3). Once it appears, the patient's condition could be serious with worse prognosis. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient's sputum was positive for the COVID-19 nucleic acid. Despite combined antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and supportive care, unfortunately, the patient succumbed to illness two days later due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.",
