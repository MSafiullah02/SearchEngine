This almost exclusively results from systemic viral reactivation, and incidence rates of up to 40 % have been reported in critically ill CMV seropositive subjects [2\u20139]. Furthermore, CMV reactivation in critically ill patients has been associated with a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation [2, 4, 9\u201313], an increased length of stay in the ICU [3, 5, 9, 10, 13], and excess mortality [2, 4, 7\u20139]. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether these findings imply that CMV reactivation is a truly independent risk factor with respect to these observed poor clinical outcomes because most studies that have assessed these associations did not adequately account for all possible sources of bias. As a consequence, CMV viremia might merely be a marker of illness severity, contributing only little to the overall burden of disease.",

For instance, when ICU mortality is the outcome, then ICU discharge is a competing risk that prohibits the event of interest from occurring first.",

Despite the uncertainties regarding the clinical relevance of CMV disease in immunocompetent critically ill patients, it is etiologically plausible that virus reactivation adds to the pulmonary pathology in patients with ARDS. In experimental murine studies, CMV reactivation caused exacerbated and prolonged cytokine and chemokine expression in lung tissues, which eventually led to increased pulmonary fibrosis compared to controls [17]. In a clinical study of open lung biopsies in ARDS patients with prolonged respiratory failure or in whom microbiological cultures remained negative, CMV pneumonia was found in 30 % of cases [18]. Both findings suggest that CMV-related pulmonary pathology may be causally linked to the clinical disease course following ARDS onset, especially in the most severely ill patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. If CMV reactivation does contribute to poor clinical outcome in these patients, either prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy with (val)ganciclovir may be considered.",

We prospectively included consecutive adults who presented with ARDS to the mixed ICUs of two tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2011 and December 2013 and required mechanical ventilation beyond day 4 of ICU admission. Since data collection for our study started before publication of the Berlin definition in 2012, ARDS was defined according to the American-European Consensus Conference criteria [21]: that is, the diagnosis required an acute onset of symptoms, the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure less than 18 mmHg and/or the absence of left ventricular dysfunction, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) less than 300. We excluded patients who had received (val)ganciclovir, (val)acyclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet in the week before ICU admission and those with known immunodeficiency [16]. Immunodeficiency was defined as a history of solid organ or stem cell transplantation, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, hematological malignancy, use of immunosuppressive medication (more than 0.1 mg prednisone per kilo for more than 3 months, more than 75 mg prednisone per day for more than 1 week, or equivalent), chemotherapy/radiotherapy in the year before ICU admission, and any known humoral or cellular immune deficiency.",

Subsequently, in seropositive patients only, viral loads in plasma were determined by real-time Taqman CMV-DNA polymerase chain reaction [22]. CMV loads were determined on a weekly basis for a maximum of 30 days following study inclusion (i.e., day 5 of ICU admission). For intermediary days, on which quantitative PCR was not performed, we estimated viral loads by log-linear imputation. CMV reactivation was defined as a viral load of at least 100 international units per milliliter (IU/mL), as calibrated according to the CMV World Health Organization (WHO) Standard. Screening for CMV was not part of routine clinical practice in either participating hospital. Neither serology results nor viral loads measured as part of our study were made available to the treating physicians, and none of the included patients therefore received antiviral treatment directed against CMV.",

Second, the subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) estimates the risk of dying from reactivation at a given time-point, while accounting for the competing risk of successful weaning. To obtain direct estimates of cumulative risks in terms of the SHR we used the Fine and Gray model [23]. Finally, to estimate the population-attributable fraction of mortality due to CMV reactivation, we used a multi-state model (Fig. S1), which accounts for the time of reactivation [24].

Thus, we performed a sensitivity analysis using marginal structural modeling to adjust for the evolution of disease severity prior to the onset of CMV reactivation (see also Supplementary Material) [27, 28]. Such analysis first involves estimation of the daily probabilities of CMV reactivation using a multivariable logistic regression model that includes markers of disease severity on a daily basis. These probabilities are used to calculate an inversed probability weight that is then included as a summary measure of all relevant covariables in the final Cox regression model.

In summary, the total burden of organ dysfunction was slightly higher in patients at the start of CMV reactivation compared to matched non-exposed control subjects, although individual markers of pulmonary dysfunction and inflammation were similar. More importantly, there was a clear trend towards resolution of organ dysfunction over time in non-exposed subjects that was less pronounced in patients having CMV reactivation.

However, a greater understanding of pathophysiology and clinical risk factors is necessary to select the optimal target population for such strategies. In our study, reactivation rates were 27 % in ARDS patients overall and 34 % among those with concurrent septic shock. The latter finding might be explained by the increased severity and duration of immune suppression that may be observed in patients with septic shock, including a pronounced depletion of T cells [31, 32]. Indeed, a recent study investigating the potential use of antiviral prophylaxis based on the screening of ARDS patients for CMV seroprevalence found that such a strategy is unlikely to be beneficial overall, but suggested a possible benefit in a post hoc subgroup of patients with septic shock [16]. As the proportion of patients with CMV reactivation increased in time, altering the minimal length of stay in the ICU as a criterion may also improve the selection of a high-risk target population. Until then, a pre-emptive treatment strategy (by which patients would be screened for CMV and treated only if reactivation occurs) seems more attractive because the number of patients exposed to the toxicity of (val)ganciclovir would be reduced by 73 %. However, the effects of pre-emptive compared to prophylactic treatment on relevant patient outcomes are most likely lower, as treatment is initiated only after reactivation has already begun. Intervention trials comparing prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment, and wait-and-see strategies are necessary before any evidence-based recommendations regarding the clinical management of CMV reactivation in critically ill patients with ARDS can be made.",

First, Cox regression analysis requires that censoring of survival time must be non-informative, but in our study this was clearly not the case since ARDS patients who are weaned and discharged from the ICU alive are in a better health state than those who remain on the ventilator beyond that time point [33, 34]. Furthermore, when ICU mortality is the event of interest, then discharge must be regarded as a competing event as it precludes this outcome from being observed [14]. The use of the subdistribution hazard model provides a general solution to this informative censoring. Second, the median time to CMV reactivation in our cohort was 8.5 (IQR 4\u201311) days. If ignored, such delays may cause distortion (termed immortal time bias) as non-exposed time observed before the onset of reactivation will be wrongfully attributed to the exposed time at risk, resulting in underestimation of effects associated with CMV reactivation [35, 36]. Time-dependent fitting of CMV reactivation status in our regression models resolved this issue.",

Therefore, it remains somewhat uncertain whether the excess mortality that we observed can be fully attributed to CMV reactivation, or whether other unknown factors\u2014including other viral reactivations [8, 37]\u2014may also be involved. Second, the principle of multivariable analysis to adjust for confounders is to statistically \u2018force\u2019 exposed and non-exposed patients to be similar in all aspects of disease aside from their reactivation status. However, in a dynamic ICU setting, during which critically ill patients continuously deteriorate and improve over time, it is very difficult to verify whether such adjustment was successful. We performed marginal structural modeling as a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible impact of variations in the evolution of disease severity between patients on our effect estimates, yet found very similar results as in our primary analysis. Third, we measured systemic CMV reactivation in plasma but did not collect information about concurrent viral loads in the lungs. This study, therefore, provides no insight into either the prevalence or relevance of pulmonary CMV reactivations. Of note, previous studies have shown that pulmonary reactivation may occur without the concurrent viremia [4, 38, 39]. Furthermore, we focused exclusively on the occurrence of reactivation while patients were on mechanical ventilation (primary analysis) or in the ICU (sensitivity analysis), as we considered these to be the most relevant time windows to potentially treat or prevent CMV reactivation in the ICU. However, because of this deliberate focus we cannot provide information about possible episodes of reactivation that may have occurred later. Likewise we did not investigate the occurrence of reactivations after day 35 in the ICU. Thus, this study only provides insight into the short-term effects of systemic CMV reactivation in ARDS patients in settings in which screening or antiviral prophylaxis is not part of routine clinical practice.",
