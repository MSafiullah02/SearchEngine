            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) constitute a large part of the total disease burden among people in productive ages and cause significant costs for society [1, 2]. Hand-washing is typically recommended as a central non-pharmacological measure against ARI, but the evidence for its effectiveness is surprisingly sparse, weak and divergent [3]. Cluster-randomized non-blinded intervention trials, sometimes combining hand hygiene with wearing of face masks, in households with newly infected index cases generally failed to statistically confirm protective effects on primary outcomes [3\u20135], but some found significant protection in subgroups that started intervention early [5, 6]. Public health intervention trials with cluster-randomization in more or less confined population segments have yielded a similar overall pattern of results with a mix of positive studies [3, 7\u20139] and studies with non-significant effects on the primary outcome but some positive findings in subgroup analyses [3, 10\u201313]. Almost unavoidable limitations, including Hawthorne effects and outcome information bias, make the results unpersuasive. Graphs showing crude data of disease occurrence over time in positive studies are unconvincing [7, 8]. Hospital-based case\u2013control studies of SARS and severe influenza, limited by their inherent uncertainty as to the controls\u2019 representativity of the population strata that generated the cases, and the possibility of recall bias, provide the most consistent support for a protective effect of frequent hand-washing [3, 14]. Prospective cohort studies have yielded mixed results [3].",

Smoking did not meet our criteria for confounding in simple models including age and overall close contact.

In a simple model including age and overall close contact, occupational status met the criteria for confounding with the outcome ARI but not ILI and was included accordingly. In our main analysis we considered interaction between included contact-related covariates and hand-washing in a stepwise forward manner.

To evaluate possible effects of participants\u2019 underreporting, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses of the main model correcting for underreporting. For each age group we calculated the total number of unreported ARI reports (m) based on the total number of person-weeks and number of reported ARIs in the surveillance system, and on the negative predictive value (NPV). We randomly selected m participants with replacement and assigned them an ARI report every time they were selected. The corrected number of ARI reports was the number of reports in the surveillance system plus the number of unreported ARIs. The entire procedure was repeated 20 times for each age group, each time with a different NPV randomly obtained from the 95% confidence interval from the validation study. The covariate adjusted main model was then fitted using the 20 corrected datasets. Three different ways of selecting the participants when assigning the missing reports were applied to create sensitivity analyses based on different assumptions. In one the participants were selected with probability weights proportional to the number of ARIs the participant had reported to the system; those with no reports were assumed to have a weight of 0.5. In another scenario the probability weight was inverse to the number of ARI reports, and those with no reports were assumed to have a weight of 2; and in the last all participants had the same weights.",

It is reasonable to assume that members of the surveillance cohort were, on average, more health conscious than the average individual in the population. The high vaccination coverage might signal such health consciousness. If they zealously engaged in other preventive measures, e.g. avoiding contacts with sick people, the scope for an effect of hand-washing might have been limited. On the other hand, this selected group probably also conscientiously reports ARI symptoms and thus strengthens the internal validity of the study. Additionally, since the group with no, or next to no, hand-washing was too small to serve as a separate category, let alone as reference in our analyses, we could not shed light on whether hand-washing had an effect on ARI risk compared to no hand-washing. The possibility of threshold effects in the lowest range of hand-washing activity must be entertained as must the possibility of effects on specific infectious agents as opposed to the syndromes measured in this study. Another important limitation is in the predictably substantial underreporting of the infectious outcomes [17]. Underreporting that is non-differential vis-\u00e0-vis the explanatory variables will not bias the risk-ratio estimate if the proportion with false positive reports is negligible [27]. A previous validation study confirmed that the false positive reporting is indeed insignificant [17], but we cannot exclude the possibility that the underreporting was differential, i.e. that participants who washed their hands frequently were more prone to report disease to the surveillance system. The study could also be affected by social desirability bias, i.e. those who infrequently washed their hands exaggerated their hand-washing frequency more than those who frequently washed their hands, and this could have obscured the effect of hand-washing. Furthermore, despite a high response rate of 70.5%, it is possible that the non-responders could have experienced an effect of hand-washing on their ARI risk which we were not able to study.",
