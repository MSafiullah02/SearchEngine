DC-SIGN is expressed on subsets of dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages [1], [2], whereas expression of DC-SINGR is restricted to endothelial cells of the liver, lymph nodes and placenta [1], [3]. Despite their different expression profiles, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR have similar amino acid composition (77% homology) and share an identical intron-exon organisation. A C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) present in both receptors binds pathogens in a Ca2+ dependent manner. A neck region, made up of highly conserved 23 amino acid repeats, plays a crucial role in tetramerization and support of CRDs, thus influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these receptors. Finally, a short cytoplasmic tail at the N-terminus with LL and YKSL motifs, and a triacidic cluster (EEE) for DC-SIGN is responsible for internalisation and signal transduction [4] leading to cellular maturation, adhesion, migration and differentiation [5]. Both lectins are known to bind multiple pathogens of great public health concern such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Dengue virus, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 8, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u20131, HIV-2, measles virus, coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome, Leishmania pifanoi, Shistosoma mansoni, and Candida albicans\n[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].",

Strikingly, these two genes behave as independent entities and are not in linkage disequilibrium [17]. These receptors appear to have undergone different evolutionary processes, leading to considerable diversity in their recognition patterns. Characterization of their genetic polymorphism may provide insight into the variability of pathogen-recognition patterns among individuals of different ethnic origins, and therefore on the susceptibility or resistance to significant pathogens. In recent years, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR polymorphisms have been associated with several infectious diseases. DC-SIGN promoter variant at position \u2212336G was associated with an increased risk for parenteral transmission of HIV-1 in Caucasian Americans [18] and for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Thai population [19]. In contrast, the wild-type variant at this position (\u2212336A), was associated with a protective effect against tuberculosis in the coloured South-African population [20] but not in Colombian individuals [21]. The neck regions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are formed by variable numbers of 69-bp tandem repeats in exon 4 that encode repeating units of 23 amino acids [16]. Heterozygosity for the number of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR tandem repeats has been associated with a reduced risk of sexual transmission of HIV-1 in Caucasian Americans [22], [23], but not in Caucasian Europeans [24]. Nattermann et al.\n[25] found that Caucasian European individuals with 5-, 6-, and 7-repeat alleles of DC-SIGNR had higher HCV-RNA levels when compared with carriers of 4- and 9-repeat alleles. Finally, Chinese individuals homozygous for the DC-SIGNR tandem repeat were less susceptible to coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome infection [26].",

Because of the essential role of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR molecules in the immune response, the implication of their alleles in human disease states, and the possible genetic variation at these loci among ethnically diverse populations, we undertook a study to analyze the full extent of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR polymorphisms in Caucasian Canadians and an indigenous African population.

The DC-SIGN \u2212332A variant found in Zimbabweans and the DC-SIGNR \u2212414A variant observed in Caucasian Canadians create potential binding sites for TCF-1\u03b1 and E1A-F transcriptional factors, respectively. Four novel mutations in DC-SIGNR 3\u2032-UTR were observed at frequencies ranging from 4% to 15% in the Zimbabwean population exclusively. There are now a number of studies suggesting that genetic variants in 3\u2032-UTR affecting RNA expression can be implicated in human disease (reviewed in [32]). Using computer-based prediction tools (Lasergene software, DNA Stars, Madison, WI), we observed that these novel mutations are likely to modify the secondary structure of the DC-SIGNR 3\u2032-UTR, which in turn could affect mRNA stability or production. Further in vitro studies will be needed to assess the possible effects of these novel 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR mutations on DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR transcriptional and translational activities.",

Of interest, the DC-SIGN promoter variant \u2212336G associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [18] and dengue hemorrhagic fever [19] is found significantly more frequently in African than in Caucasian or Asian populations (p < 0.001) (Table 1). This observation is very interesting, considering the high prevalence of at least the former infection in Africa. The \u2212336G variant, located 214 bp upstream of the major transcription site, affects a Sp1 binding site and modulates in vitro DC-SIGN transcriptional activity by decreasing its expression [19]. The reduced DC and macrophage cell surface expression of DC-SIGN in individuals carrying the \u2212336G variant might have deleterious effects on clearance of pathogens by diminishing the antigen-presenting capability of these cells. However, recent in vitro studies have shown that HIV-1 and other important pathogens target DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance and to promote their survival [33], [34]. Other relatively frequent promoter mutations, found exclusively in Africans, might also affect cell surface expression of DC-SIGN. Indeed, the TRANSFAC database search identified potential TBP and RSRFC4 binding sites in the presence of promoter variant \u2212745A and a c-Myc binding site in presence of the variant \u2212201A. At this point, it is not known whether or not these putative binding sites are biologically significant in the context of DC-SIGN transcription. More effort will be needed to determine the net impact of DC-SIGN promoter variants on its expression and to understand how the altered expression of DC-SIGN may affect immune response capacity or immune escape.",

Genotypic distribution of repeat alleles in Zimbabweans was mostly represented by the wild-type homozygous 7/7-repeat form (42%). A recent study reported that the DC-SIGNR homozygous 7/7 wild-type genotype is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection, whereas the heterozygous 7/5 genotype correlated with resistance to infection [23]. It has been suggested that heterozygous expression of polymorphic neck variants of DC-SIGNR may result in reduced ligand-binding affinity [16], [35], [36]. In fact, homozygous CHO cells transfected with DC-SIGNR containing seven tandem exon 4 repeats (7/7) had higher binding capacity than heterozygous 7/5 transfectants [26]. Whether homozygosity contributes to enhanced infection, immune escape or triggers effective immune responses remains to be established. Guo et al. [37] found that individual with homozygous or heterozygous 5-, 6-, or 7-repeat alleles would express functional DC-SIGNR, whereas shorter alleles would not oligomerize. Despite the fact that the heterozygous genotype did not affect tetramerization of the receptor, it is not excluded that shortening the neck region would significantly change position of the CRDs relative to the cell surface, thus affecting interaction with pathogens. Accordingly, the high rate of homozygosity at the wild-type repeat allele in Zimbabweans may represent a better pathogen recognition capacity for DC-SIGNR or a better chance for pathogens to subvert DC-SIGNR for immune escape.",

These variants are nonconservative substitutions with respect to amino acid composition (codons 198, 214, 221, 242) and polarity (codons 198 and 221) and might induce conformational changes in the protein neck domain. This in turn could affect the oligomerization of the receptor, resulting in altered binding capacity and specificity of the DC-SIGN protein. Haplotype reconstruction of the DC-SIGN gene (Figure 1A) in the Zimbabwean population has shown that haplotypes can contained either three (H33-H36), two (H32), or one (H16,H17,H18,H30,H31) of these amino acid changes, thus affecting the conformation of the protein in different manners and contributing to the variability of DC-SIGN at the protein level in this population. Variations in the neck domain of DC-SIGN gene, leading to different forms of the DC-SIGN receptor in Africans, may be the result of selective pressure exerted by prevalent pathogens in these geographically distinct regions.",

Several novel nucleotide variants within the regulatory 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions of the genes that are important for transcription and translation were identified. The data from this study and others [17], [19], [20], [26], [31] show that the allelic distribution of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes differs widely in populations from industrialized and developing countries, presumably because of geographically determined selection pressures. In fact, the prevalence of most of the polymorphisms that could potentially affect either the transcription, translation or function of these proteins was higher in African than in non-African populations. Moreover, haplotype reconstruction clearly demonstrates that Africans show greater genetic diversity at these two closely-related immune loci than that observed in Caucasian Canadians. A broader spectrum of infectious pathogens including some that are known specifically to subvert DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR function to escape the immune system might have played an important role in shaping the genetic repertoire of these genes among Africans. Further studies will be needed to determine the net impact of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genetic variants on the expression, translation and function of the proteins and to understand how these functional polymorphisms may affect immune response capacity or immune escape.",
