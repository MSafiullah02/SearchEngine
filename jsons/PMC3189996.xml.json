For this, we transiently coexpressed HIV-1 Gag (which drives the release of VLPs), human tetherin, and filovirus GPs in 293T cells and determined Gag levels in cell lysates and cellular supernatants. In the absence of tetherin, coexpression of filovirus GPs or HIV-1 Vpu had no effect on Gag levels in cell lysates and culture supernatants (Figure 1A). When tetherin was coexpressed with Gag, the amount of Gag in cellular supernatants (but not in cell lysates) was markedly reduced, and the inhibition of Gag release was rescued by Vpu and ZEBOV-GP (Figure 1A), in agreement with previous studies [1, 8]. The GP of the Sudan ebolavirus species (SEBOV), the GP of the proposed species Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV), as well as MARV-GP were also able to counteract tetherin (Figures 1A and 1B).",

A modest inhibition of ZEBOV release by high levels of tetherin would suggest that tetherin could restrict viral spread in vivo and might thereby force the virus to have appropriate defenses in place. To address this possibility, we employed replication-competent ZEBOV for infection of 293 cells expressing tetherin upon induction with tetracycline. Tetherin expression consistently resulted in a slight decrease in VP40 release into culture supernatants and a slight increase in VP40 levels in cell lysates (Figures 2B and 2C), indicating that tetherin was indeed able to diminish ZEBOV release under the conditions tested.",

            "text": "We next sought to investigate if EBOV-GP, like Vpu, interacts with tetherin. For this, we employed a previously described FACS-based FRET assay [32]. To measure FRET signals elicited upon ZEBOV-GP and tetherin contact, we employed a CFP-tetherin fusion construct [32, 39] and fused YFP to the C-terminus of ZEBOV-GP or to the C-terminus of the isolated ZEBOV-GP surface unit, GP1, and the isolated transmembrane unit, GP2, respectively. Analysis of 293T cells expressing a CFP-YFP fusion protein as a positive control revealed a robust FRET signal (Figure 3A), as expected [32]. In contrast, no appreciable FRET signal was detected upon coexpression of CFP-tetherin with C-terminally tagged ZEBOV-GP, GP1, or GP2 (Figure 3A). Confocal microscopy of transfected cells revealed that ZEBOV-GP-YFP was located in intracellular vesicles and at the plasma membrane, as expected, while GP1-YFP was diffusely distributed in cells and GP2-YFP was mainly detected in subcellular dot-like structures with a smaller proportion at the plasma membrane (Figure 3B). Upon coexpression of tetherin, ZEBOV-GP-YFP relocalized to some extent to intracellular structures with partial tetherin-colocalization (Figure 3C). In contrast to this, EBOV-GP1-YFP did not show pronounced tetherin-colocalization, whereas GP2 seemed to accumulate together with tetherin (Figure 3C). A 3D reconstruction of z-stacks and maximum intensity projections revealed that GP2-YFP folds into pockets of a larger tetherin accumulation (Figure 3D, upper panel). Therefore, we considered the possibility that in our experimental setup, spatial constraints (particularly a separating cellular membrane) might impede detection of tetherin interactions with GP2 by FRET. To address this, we swapped the YFP-tag of GP2 to the N-terminus and indeed measured a robust FRET signal in 293T cells cotransfected with CFP-tetherin (Figure 3A). As expected, the YFP-GP2 showed a more pronounced membrane staining, because the N-terminal YFP tag is on the extracellular site of the transmembrane protein (Figure 3B). Upon coexpression with tetherin, the YFP-GP2 fusion protein was found inside the cell and strongly colocalized with tetherin (Figures 3C and 3D, lower panel). Finally, we assessed if tetherin interactions with ZEBOV-GP2 could be demonstrated in a different experimental system. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that tetherin was able to pull down ZEBOV-GP and ZEBOV-GP2 but not ZEBOV-GP1 (Figure 3E), supporting our conclusion that tetherin interacts with the GP2 subunit of ZEBOV-GP.",

We compared the impact of filovirus GPs, Vpu, and KSHV-K5 on tetherin expression in tetherin-transfected 293T cells, IFN\u03b1-induced 293T cells, and HeLa cells, which express endogenous tetherin. FACS analysis was utilized to quantify surface-expressed tetherin, while Western blot analysis was used to determine the total amount of tetherin. Expression of Vpu profoundly reduced total tetherin expression in transfected and IFN\u03b1-induced 293T cells (Figures 4A and 4B, right panels), and in the latter cells, the reduced expression of total tetherin translated into a marked reduction of surface-expressed tetherin (Figure 4B, left panel). In fact, the degree of tetherin downregulation when transiently expressed in transfected 293T cells was likely much more pronounced than suggested by the mock control in Figure 4A. Thus, tetherin surface expression was consistently higher in cells coexpressing the murine leukemia virus envelope protein (which does not antagonize tetherin [41]) compared with cells in the mock control, likely because of efficient sequestration of transcription factors by the empty plasmid used as mock control. Markedly diminished surface expression of tetherin was also observed in Vpu-transfected HeLa cells, but the decrease in surface tetherin levels was not paralleled by a marked decrease in total tetherin expression (Figure 4C, right panel), in agreement with previously reported findings [42].",

A recent study that reported that expression of tetherin in 293 cells did not decrease ZEBOV spread [44] seems to argue against a role of tetherin in filovirus spread.

Our results indicate that EBOV-GP, like Vpu, has the ability to interfere with tetherin surface expression (see Figure 4B). However, EBOV-GPs can clearly block tetherin by a mechanism other than downregulation since efficient tetherin counteraction in HeLa cells and particularly in transfected 293T cells was not paralleled by efficient reduction of tetherin expression at the plasma membrane, in agreement with recently published reports [41, 46]. While it cannot be excluded that moderate effects of EBOV-GPs on tetherin surface expression in HeLa cells were biologically meaningful, it is more likely that EBOV-GP interferes with the configuration or integrity of plasma membrane\u2013inserted tetherin. In agreement with such a scenario, a FRET signal indicative of an interaction between GP2 and tetherin was only obtained with a GP2 harboring the fluorophore at its N-terminus. Alternatively, EBOV-GP\u2013induced relocalization of tetherin might be responsible for tetherin antagonism. Thus, tetherin localizes to lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane [15], which are also the location of HIV and EBOV budding [47, 48], raising the possibility that EBOV-GP blocks tetherin\u2019s antiviral activity by interfering with lipid raft localization of this protein or by redirecting the budding complex into certain lipid rafts in which tetherin is not present.",

We found that N-linked glycosylation of tetherin was dependent on the source of cellular tetherin, a finding that confirms and extends a previous report [16]. While the integrity of the glycosylation signals seems to be largely dispensable for antiviral activity in transfected cells [16, 49], it can be speculated that a certain tetherin glycosylation pattern might not be compatible with optimal transport of the protein to sites of viral budding and/or with optimal recognition of tetherin by viral defense proteins. It should be noted, however, that glycosylation differences are unlikely to account for the differential interference of viral proteins with tetherin surface expression in HeLa and IFN\u03b1-treated 293T cells (Figure 4), since similar tetherin glycospecies were detected in these cells lines.",

            "text": "The counteraction of tetherin by Vpu depends on the interaction of the transmembrane domains of both proteins [50]. An interaction between ZEBOV-GP and tetherin has also been demonstrated [8], but the domain(s) in ZEBOV-GP, which bind to tetherin, are unknown. Our results indicate that the transmembrane unit of ZEBOV-GP, GP2, interacts with tetherin. Isolated GP2 was able to relocalize tetherin, while the entire ZEBOV-GP was not, indicating that GP1 arrests GP-tetherin complexes at the plasma membrane. A role for GP2 in tetherin interactions is perhaps not unexpected since the GP2 equivalent of the envelope protein of HIV-2, specifically its cytoplasmic tail, is required for efficient tetherin counteraction, although specificity for tetherin seems to be determined by the extracellular portion of the envelope (Env) [11]. The tetherin-binding domain in GP2 is at present unknown. Our preliminary data suggest that the deletion of the cytoplasmic tails of EBOV-GP and MARV-GP is compatible with tetherin counteraction (data not shown). Future efforts to identify the tetherin-binding domain in GP2 should therefore focus on the role of the transmembrane domain and the extracellular portion of GP2 in tetherin binding and counteraction.",
