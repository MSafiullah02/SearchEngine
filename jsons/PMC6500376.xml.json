Genetic causes of ID still remain poorly explained because of its vast heterogeneity (Anazi et al., 2017). The involvement of C12ORF4 in ID was confirmed by observation of the presence of specific mutations in this protein-coding gene in all ID affected members of the analyzed families, including a missense variant (L328P), a deletion (Q267fs) and a frameshift. Another study shows that, in rats, the gene orthologous to C12ORF4 encodes a cytoplasmic protein, involved in mast cell degranulation (Mazuc et al., 2014).",

NAD+ is an essential cofactor and donor of the ADP-ribose group in a reaction which starts with breaking the bond between nicotinamide and ribose. As a result of the ADP-ribosylation reaction, nicotinamide and ADP-ribosylated proteins are released. Errors in the ADP-ribosylation of proteins can be associated with cancerogenesis processes (Barkauskaite et al., 2013). ADP-ribosylation of DNA is relatively less common and until recently has only been described for a small number of bacterial toxins (Jankevicius et al., 2016). However, there are new reports showing DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase activities of some mammalian PARPs (Munnur & Ahel, 2017; Zarkovic et al., 2018).",

The Macro domain was originally named A1pp, as it was described in association with ADP-ribose 1-phosphate processing activity in yeast (Martzen et al., 1999), but later it was renamed Macro in reference to the fact that it makes up the C-terminal domain of mammalian core histone macro-H2A (Allen et al., 2003; Karras et al., 2005). Macro domain proteins are widespread in eukaryotes, but also present in pathogenic bacteria, archaea and in ssRNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, Rubella and Hepatitis E viruses (Feijs et al., 2013; Rack, Perina & Ahel, 2016).",

The typical three-dimensional structure of the Macro domain can be described as a mixed alpha/beta/alpha fold. A six-strand beta sheet is sandwiched between five \u03b1-helices with the ligand binding pocket lying between two loops (loop 1 and loop 2) (Slade et al., 2011; Rack, Perina & Ahel, 2016). Some Macro domains are shorter and lack either the first strand or the C-terminal helix 5. Well-conserved residues build a hydrophobic cleft and cluster around the ADP-ribose binding site. Most important for ligand binding by Macro domains are conserved aromatic residues in binding pocket (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions with the adenosine ring) and the aspartate residue coordinating the N6 atom of adenosine. The pyrophosphate and distal ribose are stabilized by two binding loops, the first of which can contain catalytic residues in cases when the Macro domain exhibits hydrolase activity.",

Table 1 shows that both FFAS and two other popular structure prediction servers predicted a weak but suggestive similarity to Macro for the human C12ORF4 protein (see also Fig. 1). These methods use sequence profiles or Hidden Markov Models to detect distant sequence similarities compatible with similar structures. Phyre2 and HHpred are remarkably concurring in their prediction of structural similarities for C12ORF4, identifying as best-scoring structure modeling templates the Macro domains of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 14 (PDB: 3Q6Z) and human protein-proximal ADP-ribosyl-hydrolase MacroD2 (PDB: 4IQY) or human MacroD1 (PDB: 2X47). Using the servers\u2019 results, it was difficult to distinguish between the predictions, as confidence values were very close. However, FFAS03 ran on DUF2362 multiple sequence alignment used as the query gave the highest score for human PARP14 (PDB: 3Q6Z) as structural prediction, but did not pick human MacroD1/2 structures as significant hits. Using HHpred and Phyre2 local HMM profile\u2013profile alignment, an alignment for human C12ORF4 and the two best hits was constructed, considering secondary structure assignments from the human MacroD2 structure (Fig. 1). Manual adjustment was performed only in the loop 1 region. Investigating similarities between C12ORF4 and important regions of MacroD2, a similarity was noticed to the characteristic MacroD motif Nx(6)GG[V/L/I]D in the C12ORF4 region aligned with loop 1. However, there is a difference; whereas the first residue in the glycine dyad is substituted by serine: Nx(6)SG[V/L/I]D. MacroD2 residues N92 (matched with D333 in human C12ORF4) and D102 (aligned to D345 in human C12ORF4) are catalytic amino acids electrostatically interacting with the distal ribose ring of ADPr ligands. Conservation of these residues in C12ORF4 seems to support its similarity to the catalytic Macro domain class, albeit tyrosine 190, crucial for eraser function of MacroD, is substituted by a methionine (M478). The structural water molecule and aromatic ring of Y190 located in eraser loop 2 bind the ADPr moiety in constrained position enabling initiation of its hydrolysis. The reader-type Macro domain in PARP14 has conserved Asp residues in loop 1, but tyrosine within the G[IV]YG motif is replaced by a phenylalanine, also possessing an aromatic ring. In C12ORF4, there is a matched methionine at this position. This brings uncertainty regarding the catalytic activity of the C12ORF4 protein, taking into account the fact that Y->F substitution in this motif can convert a catalytically active Macro domain to a reader-only pseudoenzyme (Rack, Perina & Ahel, 2016).",

DUF2362 is also found in some fungi (albeit the fungal C12ORF4 homologs belong to specialized atypical groups of fungi, e.g., Mucoromycota, Chytridiomycota, Zoopagomycota and Cryptomycota), Amoebozoa, Apicomplexa, Choanoflagellida and Cryptophyta. C12ORF4 homologs have not been found in most fungi, or in plants, archaea or bacteria. Overall, the Jackhmmer search for new potential family members also picked up 410 C12ORF4 homologs in the Representative Proteomes and about 700 C12ORF4 homologs in UniProt. The broad phylogenetic spread of this protein family confirms its ancient origin and potentially important cellular function.

In the case of C12ORF4, automated methods would be quite risky, mainly due to the presence of long insertions (likely loops) within the hypothetical Macro domain. Residues from 374 to 408 had to be modeled without a structural template. Secondary structure prediction run for amino acids in this region of C12ORF4 indicate a mainly unstructured character of this fragment, so we decided to build a preliminary model for the C12ORF4 structure in the form of a homology model based on a human MacroD2 template, using our own manually adjusted alignment, with the building and optimization of missing loops using the I-TASSER server. An \u201ceraser\u201d template (PDB: 4IQY) was chosen because of the fact that only one Macro-like domain was detected in our query. This is similar to the \u201ceraser\u201d MacroD1/2 proteins that have only one catalytically active Macro domain. In contrast, the \u201creader\u201d PARP14 contains three repeated Macro domains. Also, there are two likely catalytic Asp residues present in the predicted loop 1 of C12ORF4. Before building the structure model, we analyzed possible templates and conservation of important residues in C12ORF4 and the whole DUF2362 family, using sequence alignments and logo. As can be noticed in Fig. 6, conservation of DUF2362 alignment positions matched to the ligand binding cleft of MacroD2 and PARP14 is high (Figs. 6B and 6D). Also, considering pairwise alignment mapping (Figs. 6A and 6C), one can see that apart from conserved (Asp/Asp) or almost conserved (Asn/Asp) catalytic positions there are also some residues conserved in C12ORF4 in the neighborhood of the putative ADPr binding site\u2013proline, alanine and glycine in the case of both templates and tyrosine in the case of PARP14.",

Studies on asthma patient material as well as animal models have led to inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP14 being considered for asthma treatment and being investigated in animal models (Zaffini, Gotte & Menegazzi, 2018). For example, in an early study in guinea pig, PARP inhibition prevented an induced asthma-like reaction (Suzuki et al., 2004). Allergen exposition induced a rapid increase in PARP activity, bronchiolar constriction, pulmonary air space inflation and mast cell degranulation in sensitized animals, while inhibition of PARP prevented the above morphological and biochemical changes to lung tissue (Suzuki et al., 2004). Our results allow us to propose a hypothesis that Macro-like C12ORF4, as a putative ADPr \u201ceraser,\u201d regulates PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation signaling, similarly to PARG, whose role in countering PARP action in airway disease is known (Sethi, Dharwal & Naura, 2017). The fact that C12ORF4 expression has been found to affect phosphorylation of several kinases (Mazuc et al., 2014) allows speculation that the effects of PARP and C12ORF4 on degranulation may be mediated by direct ADP-ribosylation of kinases. There are known cases of regulation of kinase signaling pathways by direct ADP-ribosylation of key kinases, by effectors from infectious bacteria (Young et al., 2014) and also by endogenous human ADP-ribosyltransferases (Song et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018).",

According to databases such as Expression Atlas (Papatheodorou et al., 2018), Human Protein Atlas (Uhlen et al., 2015) and Human Proteome Map (Kim et al., 2014), the C12ORF4 protein-coding gene (on a protein and transcript level) is expressed in most normal tissues, with a high level of expression in the brain and nerves, and in the genitals. In disease-specific studies, high expression levels of C12ORF4 have been reported for samples collected from glioblastoma multiforme and glioma, lymphoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and ovarian adenocarcinoma (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013). The cBioPortal database (Cerami et al., 2012) gives evidence that the C12ORF4 protein-coding gene is altered (mutation, but not deletion) in 3% of 1,939 cases (59 patients) of endometrial cancer, and smaller fractions of patients with other malignancies, for example, breast cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. The more frequently occurring alterations of the C12ORF4 protein-coding gene are presented in Table S2. The most frequent mutation, missense R335Q, has been observed in 14 cases, mainly in uterine endometrioid carcinoma samples, but also in patients with other malignancies (cBioportal). Arg335 is located within the putative Macro domain region of C12ORF4, in the conserved motif DNR, containing Asp333, suggested by us to be a likely catalytic residue (Fig. 5).",

One of these interactors, TBCK, described as a modulator of mammalian TOR signaling, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and growth and control of actin-cytoskeleton organization. Interestingly, mutations in TBCK lead to a syndrome of ID (Bhoj et al., 2016). Other interactors include the interleukin receptor IL6R, that is a proposed asthma risk locus (Ferreira et al., 2011) and is functionally related to a number of degranulation-related signaling mediators (see Fig. S2)",
