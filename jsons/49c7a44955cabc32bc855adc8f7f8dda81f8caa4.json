Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome of HBoV revealed that the virus is related most closely to canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus, which are members of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvoviridae family [Allander et al., 2007] . The worldwide distribution of HBoV was demonstrated subsequently by detection of the virus in patients with acute respiratory infection in many countries. The relative importance of HBoV as a causative agent for viral respiratory illnesses has not yet been determined, but it has been associated with respiratory illnesses ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia [Ma et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007; Fabbiani et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2009] . Although HBoV has been detected in patients of all ages, most reports have suggested that children and infants are the most at risk for infection by HBoV. In the present study, 406 children with acute respiratory infection in the Gansu Province, China, were examined for the presence of HBoV, with associated clinical presentations and epidemiological characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis of the HBoV NP-1 gene was also undertaken.",

HBoV was detected by PCR in 29 (7.1%) of the 406 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens. Eighteen (62%) of the patients infected with HBoV were male and 11 (38%) were female. The infected patients ranged in age from 24 days to 9 years, and children 5 years of age accounted for 89.7% (26/29) of the children infected with HBoV. Children 25-36 months of age had the highest infection rate (12.8%) and those 0-6 months of age had the lowest infection rate (4.9%; Fig. 1 ). HBoV was detected in every month of the study year except March, July, and November. The highest numbers of positive cases were in December and April (9 positive specimens each), whereas the peak incidence of 20.4% (9/44) was in May (Fig. 2) .",

Our data indicate that HBoV was present in 7.1% of the children younger than 14 years of age with acute respiratory tract infection and that 89.7% (26/29) of children infected with HBoV were younger than 5 years of age. Thus, the infection rate observed in the present study is consistent with previous reports, although the age group with the highest infection rate (12.8%) was 25-36 months of age. Because of the varying sensitivity of the different methods used for detecting HBoV, the exact contribution of HBoV to acute respiratory infection remains to be evaluated further. Unlike previous reports that HBoV infection was detected predominantly during the winter months [Allander et al., 2005; Kesebir et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007; Manning et al., 2007; Pozo et al., 2007] or that the prevalence of infection increased in the spring and summer [Arnold et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2006] , it was found that HBoV was detected throughout the year without any clear seasonal fluctuations. The detection of HBoV in different specimens derived from patients avoided unnecessary treatment with antibiotics.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete NP-1 nucleotide sequences of HBoV. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighborjoining method by using MEGA 3.1, and bootstrap values were determined by 1,000 replicates. Viral sequences marked with solid circle were generated from the present study, and other reference sequences were obtained from GenBank. respiratory viruses had been sought. The situation of coinfection was complex, and coinfection rates varied considerably from those in previous research. Coinfection was found in up to 69.2% of patients with HBoV DNA in Israel [Hindiyeh et al., 2008] . Coinfection leading to more severe disease has been described for hMPV and RSV [Greensill et al., 2003 ]. In the present study, the most prevalent copathogen was RSV in 9 of 16 patients. Patients were divided into acute upper respiratory infection and lower respiratory infection groups, and statistical comparisons indicated that coinfection with HBoV did not affect the severity of the disease. Because of the high coinfection rates, the exact role played by HBoV in respiratory tract disease needs to be considered more precisely.",

Unlike cough and crepitations, the frequency of fever was statistically higher in the HBoV monoinfection group than in the coinfection group; the reason remains unclear. Acute upper respiratory infection and acute bronchopneumonia were the most frequent diagnoses. Although HBoV may be a causative agent of respiratory tract infection in children, the relationship between HBoV and acute respiratory infection needs to be investigated further. Additionally, as newly discovered bocaviruses, HBoV2 and HBoV3 were detected in stool samples from children with acute gastroenteritis [Arthur et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2009] . The association of HBoV2 and HBoV3 with gastroenteritis, as well as the role of HBoV, HBoV2, and HBoV3 in human disease requires further investigation.",
