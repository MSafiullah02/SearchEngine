There is currently no cure for patients with COVID-19, but there are more than 300 different trials launched to discover a drug that would minimize both morbidity and mortality.2 Although the availability of a proven treatment for COVID-19 would be met with extreme enthusiasm, the successful testing of any drug will only be the first step in determining how to provide access on a global level.

Remdesivir had apparent success in treating a 35-year-old COVID-19 patient with pneumonia in Washington state.5 An analysis of 53 patients receiving remdesivir for compassionate use showed that 36 of them (68%) had clinical improvements, although the results are difficult to generalize given the lack of a control population.6 A subsequent trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that remdesivir was effective in reducing the length of hospitalization and might decrease the mortality of patients with COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir also seemed to be successful in treating a 62-year-old in Spain with COVID-19,7 but a recently published trial suggests the drug may not be effective.8 An early trial of favipiravir tablets among 340 patients found that the drug shortened the period to recovery while also improving the lung function of patients.9 In the meantime, a range of other medications is being explored, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.10\n",

Nevertheless, at prices of $10 000 to $15 000 per patient per year, it was unaffordable in African countries, where most infections were occurring. Antiretroviral therapy only became available in most African countries in 2002 (the launch of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and 2003 (the start of the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). As a result, more than 5 years were lost because treatment was largely limited to developed countries.14 Millions died as a result of an inability to provide affordable treatment during this time.

This will require compensating successful innovation and simultaneously unleashing global generic manufacturing capacity. Much has been written about these types of mechanisms. They typically resemble a large prize that is awarded to the innovator in exchange for the intellectual property rights (at least for low- and middle-income countries). For a pandemic of this sort, it might well be more efficient for the access to be universal, with set global prices (that would presumably be different depending on the wealth of the country) obviating the need for country-specific negotiations. There would be a clear role for a multilateral agency such as the World Health Organization or the World Bank to play.",

If a month later company B introduces a second drug that reduces mortality by 80%, would it also be eligible for the prize? What about company C that produces a drug that is also 50% effective, but costs 1/10th of the cost of company A\u2019s drug to produce? Now is the time to contemplate and define these parameters and for countries to immediately commit to a fund that would administer the prizes and negotiate global prices for any treatment.",

Economic scenarios must consider the characteristics of the potential therapeutics. In each scenario, economists should evaluate methods to incentivize or require manufacturers and donors to invest in developing and providing equitable and affordable access to treatments. Economists should also assess the cost-effectiveness associated with different therapeutics, to inform decision making by national and international policy makers regarding allocation of scarce resources. At the same time, policy makers should be informed of various ways to make treatments more affordable, including methods for using compulsory licensing, generics, and consolidated national/regional/global purchasing.",
