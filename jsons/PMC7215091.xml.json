Eighty percent of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV (2003) is identical to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic caused by the infectious disease COVID-19. The pathophysiology of CoV involves receptor-binding and proteolysis; these processes result in virus-cell fusion as previously detailed elsewhere (29). A key component of virus pathogenesis for SARS-CoV involves the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) (23, 43).",

ACE is responsible for the cleavage of AngI into AngII (34, 37), and following this process, ACE2 generates Ang (16, 23, 29, 30, 39, 41, 43) from a single residue cleavage of AngII and then acts as a negative regulator (8). This phenomenon has been demonstrated in mouse models, whereby disrupting the murine ACE2 gene leads to increased levels of AngII (6). ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes of lung, artery, heart, testicular, kidney, and intestinal cells (7, 8, 14). Alveolar epithelial type II cells of the lungs make up over 80% of the cells expressing ACE2 (45). ACE2 is also highly expressed on the liminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells (15), which may support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic may have begun with the consumption of an infected bat.",

With ACE2 as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, research demonstrates that ACE2 knockout mice are resistant to SARS-CoV infections (17, 20). Although ACE2 is needed for SARS-CoV host cell entry and replication (17), it is also important to disease progression and has been demonstrated to play a central (protective) role in determining symptom severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (18). Accordingly, animal model research demonstrates that the disease severity of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome were significantly more severe in mice with ACE2 inactivated or knocked out after the infection with SARS-CoV compared with the wild-type mice. The knockout mice, with loss of ACE2 expression after being infected, experienced enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema, neutrophil accumulation, and worsened lung function. When these mice were then treated with catalytically active recombinant ACE2 protein, these symptoms improved (18). Several other studies have also demonstrated a therapeutic effect of ACE2 treatment on acute lung injury (1, 4, 27).",

            "text": "The vast majority of the research on the impact of dietary intake on ACE2 activity has focused on dietary fat intake. Within these studies, the amount of dietary fat in the high-fat diet (HFD) groups varies from ~50 to 60% of total energy intake (11\u201313, 41). In a 10-wk dietary intervention study in mice, ACE2 gene expression was examined in a control group (76% carbohydrate, 14% protein, 10% lipids) and an HFD group, in which the HFD was rich in saturated fat (36% carbohydrate, 14% protein, 50% lipids). The mRNA levels in mice livers were assessed, and it was observed that ACE2 gene expression was reduced in the HFD group compared with the control group (11). Similarly, another study in the retroperitoneal adipose tissue of postnatal rats found that consumption of an HFD downregulated ACE2 gene expression (41). Research has also demonstrated that an HFD can lead to reduced kidney ACE2 activity only in male mice and further demonstrated that the ovariectomy of female mice fed an HFD led to reduced adipose ACE2 activity (13). These nutrition-related changes in ACE2 gene expression appear to impact further health-related outcomes. Accordingly, ACE2 deficiency resulted in increased systolic BP in male and female mice fed an HFD and promoted obesity-hypertension in female, ovariectomized mice fed an HFD (13). In a study of ACE2 knockout compared with wild-type mice fed an HFD for 16 wk, knockout mice were more susceptible to beta cell dysfunction (24).",

Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in plant-based foods, such as red wine, berries, grapes, cocoa, and other foods. This compound is known for its potential protective effect against a number of conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory illness (2, 33, 42). To date, three studies have assessed the impact of resveratrol on ACE2 activity. In a study of rats assigned to one of five different experimental diet groups, the rats who were fed 50 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day of resveratrol demonstrated increased ACE2 protein level (38). In another study of mice fed an HFD compared with mice fed an HFD + resveratrol, there was significantly increased ACE2 gene expression in mice fed the HFD + resveratrol. Therefore, the addition of dietary resveratrol may help to mitigate the detrimental impacts of high-fat diets on ACE2 gene expression (30). Last, an in vitro study using human aortic smooth muscle cells demonstrated that incubation of cells with resveratrol for 24 h significantly increased ACE2 gene and protein expression (28).",

The abovementioned results suggest that interactions between ACE2, dietary fat, and SARS-CoV, as well as ACE2, resveratrol, and SARS-CoV influencing illness severity are biologically plausible in humans. Thus, we propose a potential mechanism whereby lower dietary fat and/or higher resveratrol intake may modulate responses to SARS-CoV, dependent on genetic variations in ACE2, which may then upregulate or downregulate its activity (Fig. 1). This hypothesis is supported by the abovementioned research demonstrating 1) that ACE2 plays a key role in SARS-CoV disease progression (18) and 2) the impact of diet on ACE2 expression and function (11, 13, 24, 28, 30, 38, 41).

As such, this proposed mechanism could add to the body of knowledge seeking to explain why SARS-CoV illness severity is greater in individuals with DM as well as in individuals with hypertension (HTN) (29). In addition, ACE2 genetic variations contribute to type 2 DM and HTN risk, and thus high-risk genetic variants are more prevalent in these populations. Specific ACE2 SNPs that have been previously demonstrated to be associated with type 2 DM and HTN (rs2106809, rs4646174, rs2074192, rs4240157, rs4646188, rs1978124, rs233575, rs2158083) are of interest to future research (10, 25, 31, 32, 40, 44). One study previously explored ACE2 genetic variations between SARS-CoV (2003) cases, noncases, and contact and while no significant associations were found (19), it is possible that dietary intake confounded these results. In addition, to our knowledge this study has yet to be replicated for SARS-CoV-2. Several other potential SNPs of interest were outlined in this study (19), which would be worth exploring in future research involving ACE2 and SARS-CoV illness severity.",
