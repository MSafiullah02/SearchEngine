The disease mortality rate in Ilam city, Iran has been reported as 7.14% (Ghaysouri et al., 2020).Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a blood product containing a mixture of polyclonal IgG antibodies extracted from plasma of around one thousand blood donors. IVIG probably suppresses inflammatory reactions by a multi factorial mechanism (Ghaysouri et al., 2020), and its therapeutic effects last from 2 weeks to 3 months. IVIG is used as an alternative to IgG in patients with immunodeficiency or those who are unable to produce antibodies. In these patients, IVIG leads to inactive immunity and provides adequate antibody levels to prevent infections (Kile et al., 2020; Shalman et al., 2020).",

The clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by the real-time reverse-transcription\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay through combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab samples. She was hospitalized and treated with hydroxychloroquine, Kaletra, oseltamivir, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Despite this, clinical symptoms gradually aggravated, and Sat.O2 level decreased during hospitalization. On the day 16th after admission, she was intubated due to respiratory distress and a fall in Sat. O2 to as low as 62%. Chest X- Ray (CXR) clearly revealed acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient's antibiotic treatment was then converted to vancomycin, Tavanx, hydroxychloroquine, Kaletra and oseltamivir. After 5\u20136 days of the hospitalization, the patient's clinical condition worsened, and she experienced a reduction in Sat. O2. Considering a probable Hospital-acquired pneumonia, wide-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem) were administrated. After the results of procalcitonin test came negative, antibiotic treatment stopped.",

In this study, we used high-dose IVIG (0.3\u20130.5 g/kg daily for 5 days) to potentiate and modulate a viral immune response. All the 5 patients selected in this study were hospitalized, and despite receiving a standard treatment based on the protocols of the Iran Ministry of Health [i.e. hydroxychloroquine (400 mg tablets) stat and Kaletra (2 tablets every 12 h)], clinical responses were inferior, the patients' condition deteriorated, and Sat.O2level decreased which was not responsive to supportive treatments such as Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)leading to patient's intubation. In CT scans, the progression of pulmonary lesions was evident compared to the hospitalization time. Shortly after IVIG administration, all the patients' clinical and respiratory conditions improved, and Sat.O2levels increased resulting in sooner extubating of the patients. In the control CT graphs obtained after IVIG therapy, there were obvious improvements in pulmonary lesions.
