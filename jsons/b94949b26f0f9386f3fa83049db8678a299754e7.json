In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation. Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).",

Joel Jeffrey in 36 [7], transforms the nucleotide sequence (DNA or RNA) to bi-dimensional 37 real values. The CGR maintains the statistical properties of the nucleotide 38 sequence, and it allows an investigation of the local and global patterns in 39 sequences [8, 9]. 40 The CGR has with input the nucleotide sequence, s, expressed as s = [s 1 , . . . , s n , . . . , s N ]",
