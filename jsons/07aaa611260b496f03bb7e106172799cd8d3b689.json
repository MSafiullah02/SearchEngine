The easier contagion of fake news online can be causally explained by the greater anger it carries. Offline questionnaires reveal that anger leads to more incentivized audiences in terms of anxiety management and information sharing and accordingly makes fake news more contagious than real news online. Our results suggest that the digital contagion of emotions, in particular anger, should be comprehensively considered in profiling the spread of online information. Cures such as tagging anger in social media could be implemented to slow or prevent the contagion of fake news at the source.",

Unique structural features in the circulation of fake news, such as long diameters of penetration, have been revealed and have been found to be platform independent (13) (14) (15) (16) . However, fake news is generally verified to be false after explosive circulation (17) ; thus, in the early spread, it is essentially not thought to be fake, so the structural uniqueness is the manifestation of its fast spread, rather than a cause that can fundamentally explain its viral proliferation. Individuals, either human or bots (18) , posting and reposting fake news on social media are an alternative cause, in particular, the human that occupies the dominant partition (19) . The spread of news is associated with the friends and followers of the author. Nevertheless, user characteristics fail to sufficiently explain the easy contagion of fake news due to their greater effects on the dissemination of real news (2) . The content of fake news, which was also found to be entangled with spread (2, 20) , could offer promising directions in probing the mechanism of its fast spread. More importantly, instead of examining spreading structures (2, 13) and reposter demographics (21) after the circulation was ignited, revealing the mechanism at the source that independent to user demographics would be powerful in inspiring new cures with the minimum invasion of privacy. Hence, we would rather differentiate fake news from real news at the very beginning of their spread through scrutiny of content to figure out new treatments against fake news that can be implemented without delay.",

Furthermore, the dominance of anger in fake news (especially highly retweeted news) and joy in real news (even lowly retweeted news) is further confirmed with better resolution in the distribution of emotions of keywords that precisely separate the treatment groups from control groups (see SM S6 and Fig. S10 ). These observations persistently suggest that fake news carries more anger yet less joy than real news and imply the possibility that anger might promote the fast spread of fake news online. The divergence in anger and joy between fake news and real news is robust and independent of emotion inference models and emotion distribution measures (see SM S7). Even in specific events like COVID-19, the dominance of anger to joy in highly retweeted fakes news conformably suggests the promotion of anger in fast spread of fake news (see SM S7). By contrast the near overlap in disgust between different types of news ( Fig. 1C, D) , the less occupation of fake news when sadness more than 0.5 (Fig. 1H) , and the more dominant position of fear in HLF news (Fig. 1I ) indicate their less positive roles in the virality of fake news (24, 34, 38) . Therefore, significant gaps across news groups could also be independent of circulation, and well-controlled causal inference is accordingly necessary for anger and joy.",

Other emotions are omitted (Table 1 (1)) due to multicollinearity and their trivial impact on circulation. Moreover, for the logit model used to estimate all true and fake news, anger is positively associated with fake news, though with a smaller coefficient and narrower deviation, as anticipated (Table 1 (2)). Recalling the gaps observed in emotion distributions across groups of news, all the results consistently suggest the positive promotion effect of anger in the circulation of fake news, particularly for news that is highly retweeted. The causally negative relationship between joy and fake news contrarily indicates its prevention in dissemination. To further qualify the influence of both anger and joy in the spread of fake news, a linear regression model with the number of retweets as the dependent variable is established (see SM S9). It is congruously found for fake news and all news that the coefficients of anger are significantly positive while the coefficients of joy are negative (Table   1 (3) and (4)), suggesting that anger can promote circulation and joy can prevent the spread.",

The above causal relationships between emotions and circulation are robust to alternative emotion detection approaches such as competent machine learning models (see Table S17 ). For other significant factors, although mention can promote the spread of news (Table 1 (3) and (4)), the coefficient is not significant for LHF news (Table 1 (1)) and even prevents the spread of fake news (Table 1 (2)); emergency is significantly positive in the logit models (Table 1 (1) and (2)) but inconsistently negative in the linear models (Table 1 (3) and (4)) (see SM S8 for more de-tails). Therefore, carrying more anger and less joy is the mechanism behind the fast spread of fake news that makes it more viral than real news online. More importantly, additional evidence from extensive datasets of English news on both Twitter and main stream media further confirms the independence to cultures and platforms of this mechanism (see SM 10) .",

The odds of being forwarded through e-mails are also causally impacted by the physiological arousal caused by emotional articles, and those evoking high-arousal positive or negative emotions could be more viral (34) . In the spread of fake news, the incentives behind the action of reposting that reignites circulation are therefore hypothetically associated with the anger and joy the news carries. Taking LHF news as the treatment group and HLF news and HLT news as the control groups, the possible associations between reposting incentives and emotions are examined through offline questionnaires. By selecting 15 typical news items with keywords from these groups (see SM S11), questionnaires are implemented to investigate four motivations for news reposting in social media (42), including anxiety management, information sharing, relationship management and self-enhancement. The subjects of the surveys are Weibo users, and the overlapping between offline subjects and online users is ensured (see SM S12). Preliminary results indicate that the motivation of anxiety management in LHF news is significantly higher than that in the control groups ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, compared to HLT news, subjects are more intensively incentivized to share information when reposting HLF news and LHF news (Fig. 2B) . Thus, fake news can stimulate strong motivation for information sharing; in particular, news that is widely disseminated can also strengthen the motivation for anxiety management. There is no significant variation in the motivation for relationship management across news groups (Fig. 2C ), and the motivation for self-enhancement in HLT news is stronger than that in fake news (Fig. 2D) . What is more interesting is that in questionnaires with keywords highlighted with marks, the unique stimuli of widely circulated fake news for anxiety management is strengthened (see Fig. S23A ).",

All these results imply that the responses to the anger carried by fake news are sharing information and even managing anxiety. To validate this finding, the news in questionnaires is further split into anger-dominated news and joy-dominated news (see SM S13.2) to directly probe the impact of emotions. Compared to the retweeting motivations of joy-dominated news, anger-dominated news stimulates stronger incentives for anxiety management (Fig. 2E ) and information sharing ( Fig. 2F ). Joy-dominated news ultimately excites stronger self-enhancement ( Fig. 2H ) than anger-dominated news. Meanwhile, no significant difference is observed between anger and joy in terms of relationship management motivation (Fig. 2G ). Shuffling emotions randomly further testifies to the significance of these observations (see SM S13.2). Therefore, the greater anger delivered in fake news leads to more incentivized audiences with respect to anxiety management and information sharing, resulting in a greater likelihood of retweets and, thus, more viral contagion.",

On social media, the associations between information diffusion and embedded emotions have been noted for a long time; however, the profiles of the roles of both positive and negative emotions are inconsistent and even contradictory across diverse contexts (23) . Considering the heterogeneous influence on spreading from negative emotions such as anger and sadness (24, 34, 38) , the causal impact on information diffusion should be examined with respect to well-resolved negative emotions. Instead of simplifying emotions binarily into positive and negative emotions, more elementary emotions are considered in this study, and the distribution of five emotions is inferred to reflect the complete emotional spectrum of news online. This more detailed spectrum of emotions identifies angers unique role in provoking strong incentives of anxiety management and information shar-ing, which results in the virality of fake news online. From this perspective, emotions could be genes of fake news circulation, and similar to small mutations, they could make the virus go viral. Mutations that increase anger or reduce joy in fake news enhance its likelihood of being retweeted. Distinguishing structures in the circulation of fake news, which have been pervasively revealed in both Twitter (?, 2) and Weibo (14) , could also be deciphered based on the anger such news predominantly carries since anger prefers weak ties in social networks (?) and may inherently forge the diffusion structure of fake news (see SM 2.3). Meanwhile, the role of joy in preventing spread, especially in fake news, underlines the fundamentality of considering negative emotions of fine granularity to control and deepen future explorations. Therefore, it is anticipated that insights from emotions will improve the extant understanding of online information spread.",

What is worse, like a cat-and-mouse game between manipulation and detection, features derived from content or users that were found to be helpful in machine learning on targeting fake news (45) can be easily converted to inspire future countermeasures for fabricating more sophisticated false news (11) . In particular, fake news related to emergencies is widely disseminated because of its clever combination with anger, which may explain why efforts to counter misperceptions about diseases during epidemics and outbreaks are not always effective (10) . Inefficient or ineffective efforts to detect fake news and debunk misinformation by correcting both calls for new treatments and preventing the spread of anger could be a profound and promising direction. The early deviation in dissemination paths between fake news and real news suggests the rapid effect of anger in shaping retweeting (25) . For example, platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Weibo should warn and discourage users as they try to retweet news that delivers too much anger and persuade them to assess the credibility of the information more critically. The trade-off between free speech and fake news prevention is the prime principle; however, a better balance would be achieved by tagging angry news (e.g., with an occupation of anger of more than 20%, see SM S14 for more details) at the very beginning to make audiences and potential spreaders less emotional and more rational (46).

Further probes on the timelines of all news items confirm this fact in S3. Real news, also termed true news in this study, refers to information that was not tagged as false by the committee and was posted by verified users, such as mainstream media, elites, or public authorities, with credibility. In total, we collected 22,479 fake news items (with 1,189,186 users) and 10,000 real news items (with 409,865 users) from 2011 to 2016.

A subset of the fake news and real news used in this study was employed in the previous study (14) on the structural uniqueness of fake news, in which equivalent results are derived from both Weibo and Twitter, implying the reliability and universality of our data.

To examine the causal impact of emotions on the circulation of fake news, treatment groups and control groups are established to control for variables and infer the significant roles of emotions underlying the spread. Considering that the role of emotions in information spreading might be subtle and easily interfered with by other variables, such as the influence of authors, we aim to split news, either fake or real, into a treatment group (e.g., highly retweeted news posted by authors with a low volume of followers) and a control group (e.g., lowly retweeted news posted by authors with a high volume of followers), through which the possible influence of authors can be controlled and the effects of emotions are amplified. Intuitively, for highly retweeted news posted by authors with a low volume of followers, promotion from the content, in particular, the emotions carried, would be more powerful and thus easier to detect. Therefore, we group the news according to the number of its authors followers (x) and the number of retweets (y) (16) .",

The whole labeling task was completed by nine well-instructed coders who are active users of Weibo with ages between 18 and 30 years old, and each term is labeled three times by randomly selected coders.

Moreover, to further examine the difference between anger and joy and its possible association with the fast spread of fake news, we compare the emotional differences between HLF news and LHF news. The results show that the amount of anger in LHF news is significantly higher than that in HLF news (Fig. 1A in the main text), and the amount of joy is significantly lower than that in HLF news (Fig. 1E in the main text), which is consistent with the comparison between L news and H news (Fig. S9A, S9C ).

However, negative emotions, especially anger, dominate the keywords in LHF news (Fig. S10D) . These observations support the initial assumption that emotions carried by news, in particular, the dominant emotions of anger and joy, can be reflected by keywords that effectively separate different groups of news; therefore, these keywords will affect the incentives underlying retweets. Meanwhile, the exact same difference in the emotion distribution at the keyword level further confirms the consistency and robustness of the emotional divergence between fake news and true news revealed at the collective level (see S5).

The coverage of this emotion lexicon is 73.3% on the dataset used in the logit model. Though emotions carried by English news here is expanded to eight emotions, the promoting effect of anger is still significant and joy is opposite as expected (Table S18 ). These results suggest that the promoting effect of anger in spread is independent to cultural differences and our results can be confidently extended to English news. Other emotions such as disgust and anticipation are also found to be significant but with negative coefficients, implying their prevention on the spread. It should also be noted that here the linear model is not examined due to the missing of retweeting time in these datasets, i.e., whether the spread of news is sufficiently sampled cannot be assured, and consequently it would be problematic to treat the number of retweets directly as dependable variables.",

Except for the news presented, all other circumstances in the questionnaires, e.g., author profile, posting time, and posting source, are carefully controlled to be consistent. Specifically, the difference in stimuli to the incentives of subjects is only the news itself. For the presentation of the text, we attempted to simulate the real Weibo interface by adding the background of the mobile version of the Weibo App to each news item (Fig. S22 ). For subjects who completed the questionnaires, we required them to be Weibo users aged between 18 and 30 years old (according to the 2018 Weibo user development report, this age group accounts for 75% of all users), matching users in online data as much as possible. 13 Note that subjects are not specifically targeted based on occupation or income level because we want to probe the general effect of emotion divergence on the retweeting incentives for the majority of Weibo users. More importantly, considering the widespread global impact of fake news online, revealing a mechanism that is independent of user demographics would be powerful in inspiring new cures. 13 https://data.weibo.com/report/index ",

In the analysis in S13.1, we found that the marked keywords play a role in widening differences. Hence, we directly combine the responses without keywords and those with keywords according to their dominant emotions to further examine the emotions stimuli with respect to retweeting motivation. The results are analyzed in the main text, and the K-S tests results are shown in Table S26 . Furthermore, in terms of neglecting emotion dominance, all the data of the questionnaires are divided into two groups randomly to analyze the difference in motivations.

According to this conclusion, instead of determining new features in fake news detection, developing new cues of tagging anger on social media is a promising approach to restrain the spread of fake news at the source. Because the intervention can be implemented immediately after posting, there will be no lag in the fight against fake news. More importantly, the principle of guaranteeing the freedom of speech will be respected, and an acceptable trade-off between free sharing and fake news prevention can be achieved. By alerting users of angry tweets, audiences can be persuaded to assess them more critically before emotionally retweeting, consequently leading to less emotional and more rational retweeters. Specifically, for tweets (news) that deliver too much anger, e.g., the occupation of anger surpasses a predetermined threshold (\u03b8), a retweeting warning could be provided on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Weibo. According to a report of Facebook in battling misinformation of COVID-19, warning labels can effectively prevent 95% users from further access. 15 In accordance with this, it is very optimistically assumed here that no angry tweets with warning tags from the platform will be retweeted. To determine the value of \u03b8, we focus on news with high volumes of retweets (HT news and HF news in our data) and define a measure to optimize \u03b8, i.e., preventing fake news that will be highly retweeted but not real news that will be popular. The measure is denoted as \u03b2 and is defined as",

In our dataset from Weibo, warning about news in which anger occupies more than 20% will efficiently and effectively prevent 46% of highly retweeted fake news and only influence the circulation of 22% of popular real news. And for all highly retweeted news in our dataset (i.e., HF+HT), in those with occupation of anger higher than 0.2, HF news accounts for 89%, implying further that our treatment can predominantly target highly retweeted fake news. Though the fraction of prevented fake news that otherwise will be widely circulated is not as high as expected, considering the intrinsic characteristics of very low cost and timely intervention, the newly presented treatment should be weighted with high priority in the toolbox of cures against fake news. Hence, it is worth trying on social media platforms such as Weibo, Twitter or Facebook to prevent the spread of fake news online at the source through this new approach. ",

These groups of news are further split into two corpora to learn binary classification models, i.e., one corpus is composed of LHF news (positive class) and HLT news (negative class) and the other corpus is composed of LHF news (positive class) and HLF news (negative class). Words are used as text features to calculate the TF-IDF matrix (53) for classification. After 5-fold crossvalidation, the average accuracies are 0.94 (SVM) and 0.98 (logistic regression) in the corpus of LHF-HLT and 0.75 (SVM) and 0.81 (logistic regression) in the corpus of LHF-HLF, implying that using words as features results in good separation of LHF news from HLT news and HLF news. Moreover, content carrying emotions such as anger and joy could be an influential driver of news circulation. In particular, the better separability between LHF news and HLT news suggests the feasibility of keywords in strengthening the divergence of different news items in reposting stimuli. On this basis, we combine the chi-square test, mutual information, Ad-aBoost, and extra-trees for feature selection(54), and 150 influential keywords with the greatest weights in the classification are selected from each group of news items(Fig. S10A, C, and E).2  By analyzing the emotional distributions of keywords in each type of news, we found that 2 These methods are implemented with the scikit-learn package in Python.",

S7 Additional tests for emotion inference and divergence S7.1 Alternative approaches of emotion inference In addition to the emotion lexicon, which offers an intuitive measure of emotion occupation, machine learning models, in particular, state-of-the-art solutions such as deep neural networks, are alternative models to infer the emotion distributions of both fake and true news. In this study, to ensure the consistency and accuracy of our results on emotion distributions, we also considered classic machine learning and deep learning models. Specifically, two classifiers built for emotion detection in Chinese tweets from Weibo are employed to perform the additional tests, namely, a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier (termed Bayes, with an accuracy of 0.64) (55) and a backpropagation neural network based on an emotional dictionary (termed BP1, with an accuracy of 0.69) 3 , to calculate the emotion distributions of the texts in terms of probabilities of belonging to certain emotions. Then, the occupations of different emotions are further compared across groups, and the results are shown in",

Then, the text of a news item is converted into a vector of 200 dimensions by averaging the embeddings of all terms in the text. To increase the number of inference models of emotions, six additional emotion classifiers are constructed on the emotion lexicon: including AdaBoost, decision tree, logistic regression, ridge classifier, SVM, and backpropagation neural network (BP2). 4 Specifically, terms with emotional labels in the emotion lexicon are first embedded to train these models; then, the emotions of news item text in the same embedding space are inferred.
