The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 2 On March 23, 2020, more than 390 000 confirmed cases tested positive for COVID-19 worldwide, according to the WHO. 3 Countries started to take proactive precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Saudi Arabia (SA) is located in the Middle East Gulf Region. In 2019, SA's population was reported to be more than 34 million. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in SA was reported on the March 2, 2020 for a Saudi citizen returning from Bahrain. 4 Soon after, restrictions in gatherings of religious activities, sporting events, and transportation were instituted by the government. On the March 8, 2020, the Ministry of Education announced that public and private schools, as well as universities, would be closed. All educational institutions started to rely on online resources to deliver their coursework.",

Degree in which their curriculum is structured in a similar way to the one offered in the United States. 5 Pharm.D. training consists of a rigorous didactic curriculum followed by clinical rotations. During the last year of their Pharm.D. program, students spend their time fulfilling their advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) requirements in which they rotate every 4 to 5 weeks through different sites and clinical settings. 5 During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health professional schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in order to prevent exposure to potentially infected cases. The College of Pharmacy at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences is located in Riyadh City, the capital of SA. It is affiliated with a large academic medical institution that has a bed capacity of more than 1800 beds. Our curriculum is adopted and modified from an Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) accredited pharmacy school from the United States. 6 Restricting the presence of interns in our affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation.

Moreover, the provided timeline for the restructured modality is more an estimate, and meeting sessions were adjusted according to the day-to-day COVID-19 situation. We urge other Pharmacy schools to adopt and customize their APPE rotations to ensure that the integrity of the learning outcomes is being delivered as per the requirements. We also urge the clinical pharmacy educational and professional bodies to release recommendations on the available modalities and best practices that could be used to ensure the delivery of the Pharmacy curriculum during this pandemic, which could then also be used in other urgent circumstances in the future. have a chance to interact with other health care students, given the fact that other health care schools were using different modality than ours.

Nevertheless, we had some challenges in the assessment of the interprofessional skills domain, given the nature of the clinical practice, which requires on-site interaction with other health care providers.

Moreover, depending on the urgency, students were requested to provide evidence-based formal answers for any drug-related questions that came up during daily bedside rounds that had to be communicated verbally or in writing.

Given the high demand for these resources during crisis times like this pandemic, internet connectivity and technical issues may limit the continuous daily use of these resources. Therefore, ensuring the availability of more than one resource to APPE students is crucial to maintaining an uninterrupted learning experience.Our experience had certain limitations that are worth highlighting.First, despite the benefit of implementing a specialist model for a clinical pharmacy that allows more educational time at our institution, it was challenging to maintain optimal educational experience for our APPE students in addition to the academic, clinical, administration, and research duties during this outbreak. However, implementing more online videoconference discussions allowed for increased flexibility in the given timeframe. Second, our affiliated hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City, is part of the National Guard Health Affairs system, which does not grant any remote access to electronic medical records for all health care providers. Although this could have a major effect on real-case scenario exposure for students, maximizing the number of de-identified or made-up patient cases provided by the faculty and optimizing the use of online-based simulated cases could maintain the learning experience. Moreover, the number of real patients cared for by the APPE students was lower than normal during COVID-19. Also, one major limitation of the current circumstance with COVID-19 is the limited face-to-face interaction with other health care providers, which hinders the interprofessional learning experience. That being said, this modality does not violate the ACPE standards as they suggest using multiple modalities including, face-toface, tele-health, or videoconferencing technology to conduct the interprofessional educational activities.7 Our restructuring strategy may fill a temporary gap but is not a sustainable model. Using videocommunication interaction may offer a decent compromise that could be optimized via implementing strict strategies to ensure patient safety and privacy. Unfortunately, our pharmacy students did not",
