The impressive fast spread of the virus is unprecedented and has exceeded all expectations. The containment of the virus is increasingly challenging as almost all countries in the world become infected.",

            "text": "The virus has begun on from Wuhan district in China, where the first confirmed case was reported to have happened on November 17, 2020 [2] . Initially, the confirmed cases in China were continually increasing. On January 31, the total infections reached a bit less than 10000 confirmed cases, with 214 recovered and 213 reported deaths (2% death rate, and similar for recovery). Although the Chinese authorities have taken incremental and prompt preventive measures to avoid the exponential outbreak, the virus continued to spread not only within Chinese borders but also worldwide. The virus was transmitted through travelers around the world. One of the most dangerous aspects of the Coronavirus is that it has an incubation period of 2-14 days, during which the patient transmits the virus without having any symptoms. All these circumstances have favored the exponential growth of the infection leading to a world health emergency crisis. As a consequence, after only two months from the official declaration of COVID-19 as Global Public Health Emergency, and despite the numerous exceptional preventive measures that every country has taken to avoid the outbreak, the virus has contaminated almost all the world countries. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the number of countries that were affected by the Coronavirus outbreak from January 22 until March 26, 2020, based on the daily report data provided by Johns Hopkins University repository [3] .It is observed from the figure that the outbreak pick growth started towards the end of February, which is almost four weeks since the disease was declared as a Global Public Health Emergency. Besides Asia, the first continent to be severely affected, the outbreak has been more generalizing to other continents during March 2020, putting first Europe into a crisis, followed by the Americas, and finally the African countries. At the time of writing this paper, a total of 173 countries are reported to have confirmed cases with different gravity, while only 60 countries had confirmed cases at the end of February 2020, and only 25 countries at the end of January 2020. This means that the increase rate was between 2.4 to 2.9 each month. Almost all countries worldwide are currently infected, but the impact of the COVID-19 virus has widely varied between the continents, regions, and countries. This represents the motivation of this data analytics study. Our objective is to unveil the secrets of the COVID-19 virus and understand its evolution in the world. We aim to know the distribution of confirmed and death cases across the continents, regions, and countries and the correlation between them. Furthermore, we compare the impact of the The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

The authors of [8] addressed the question about how the virus has spread from the epicenter of Wuhan city to the whole world. They have also analyzed the impact of preventive measures such as quarantine and city closure in mitigating the adverse impact of the spread. The authors have demonstrated visual graphs and developed a mathematical model of the disease transmission pattern.

Comparing the trend death and the trend of recovered cases, it can be observed that the ratio of recovered to death rates, was 0.86 (19/22) in January 2020, meaning that the death rate was a bit higher in January than the recovered rate. However, in February 2020, the ratio of recovered to death rates increases to 13.33 (1373/103) and reaches 3.66 (2906/792) in March 2020. Thus, the general trend is that the disease is being more controlled in terms of fatality rates due to increasing emergency procedures that the different countries have implemented.",
