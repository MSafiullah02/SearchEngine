In addition, the serum concentrations of haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined to describe the correlation between the presence of infectious agents and acute phase protein response. In order to avoid contamination from bacteria resident in the upper respiratory tract, the sampling was performed by trans-tracheal aspiration. This method has been recommended as optimal for evaluation of the microbiological status of the lower respiratory tract in order to elucidate the etiology of pneumonia in an animal (Espinasse et al., 1991, Rebbun, 1995, Virtala et al., 1996, Pommier, 1999, Pommier and Wessel, 2002). Finally, an aim was to evaluate whether PCR tests are suitable for obtaining a reliable and quick diagnosis of pneumonia related to bacterial pathogens.",

On the other hand, no BRSV-antigens could be detected in herds 5 and 6 and the test of paired sera from these two herds showed that seroconversion to BRSV had not taken place.

SAA concentrations of the healthy calves were much closer to those of the diseased populations than what was found for haptoglobin. Of the three herds in which healthy and diseased populations were compared to each other, BRSV could be demonstrated in the diseased subpopulations of herds 1 and 3 but not in the diseased population of herd 5. SAA concentrations in herd 5 did not differ between the diseased and the normal subpopulation. This might indicate that SAA needs virus to be present in order to respond while haptoglobin is fully induced by bacterial infection alone. It has previously been shown that SAA seems to be a more sensitive marker for viral infections (Heegaard et al., 2000) and acute inflammation (Alsemgeest et al., 1994, Horadagoda et al., 1999) compared to haptoglobin. In experimental bacterial infections (intra-tracheal inoculation of M. haemolytica), SAA was found to be more rapidly induced than haptoglobin (Horadagoda et al., 1994). The results presented here show that even if SAA is more sensitive and rapidly reacting, haptoglobin might be preferable in the field, its bigger and more prolonged response giving rise to its higher sensitivity in detecting disease.",

For P. multocida, a higher number of samples were found positive by cultivation than by PCR, but the difference was not statistically significant. The lower sensitivity of the P. multocida PCR compared to cultivation may be due to the large size of the amplicon produced by this method (1250 bp) compared to the H. somni and M. haemolytica PCRs (both approximately 400 bp). Detection of P. multocida by both cultivation and PCR was significantly associated with the disease status of the animal, whereas no such association was observed for M. haemolytica. A previous study on H. somni demonstrated a higher sensitivity of a species-specific PCR test (Tegtmeier et al., 2000b) compared to bacterial cultivation. However, the present investigation indicates that PCR nevertheless is less suited for prediction of H. somni-related pneumonia compared to bacterial cultivation. These observations might be related to the fact that the use of a highly sensitive method such as PCR will also detect the presence of a very low number of bacteria that not necessarily have any correlation with disease. On the other hand, a higher diagnostic value of a PCR test could be obtained if real-time PCR tests were developed, whereby the infectious agents can be quantified and give a result which might better reflect the clinical status of the animal.",
