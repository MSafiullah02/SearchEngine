Genomic sequence analysis will provide the molecular epidemiology and help to develop vaccines. Methods: We developed a rapid method to amplify and sequence the whole SARS-CoV genome from clinical specimens. The technique employed one-step multiplex RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS-CoV genome, and then nested PCR was performed to amplify a 2-kb region separately. The PCR products were sequenced. Results: We sequenced the genomes of SARS-CoV from 3 clinical specimens obtained in Taiwan. The sequences were similar to those reported by other groups, except that 17 single nucleotide variations and two 2-nucleotide deletions, and a 1-nucleotide deletion were found. All the variations in the clinical specimens did not alter the amino acid sequence. Of these 17 sequenced variants, two loci (positions 26203 and 27812) were segregated together as a specific genotype -T:T or C:C. Phylogenetic analysis showed two major clusters of SARS patients in Taiwan. Conclusion: We developed a very economical and rapid method to sequence the whole genome of SARS-CoV, which can avoid cultural influence. From our results, SARS patients in Taiwan may be infected from two different origins.",

            "text": "An atypical pneumonia with high contagiousness first appeared in the Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in November 2002, which infected 792 cases and caused 31 deaths. This disease spread to Hong Kong first, and caused an outbreak in many countries including Vietnam, Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries. Almost 9,000 individuals have been infected and over 900 have died from the disease since February 2003 [1] . This new and deadly syndrome was first brought to the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO) by Dr. Carlo Urbani, and was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2] . The pathogenesis of SARS is believed to be a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was first found by Peiris et al. [3] in Hong Kong and was confirmed by other groups [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The analysis of genomic sequences showed that the virus is different from previously known coronaviruses [9] [10] [11] , and serological studies also confirmed that the virus has not been found in humans [12] . The Coronaviridae family is a diverse group of large, enveloped and positive-stranded RNA viruses, and these viruses may cause respiratory and enteric infections in humans and animals. The previously known human coronaviruses are frequent causes of the common cold. Lifethreatening pneumonia caused by coronaviruses is uncommon. Generally speaking, the genome of coronavirus is the largest (about 30 kb in length) found in any RNA viruses, which encodes 23 putative proteins, including 4 major structure proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. The N, S and M mature proteins contribute to generating the host immune response [13, 14] . Similarly, the genome of SARS-CoV is a 29729-nucleotide with polyadenylated RNA and about 41% GC content. The genomic organization of SARS-CoV is similar to that of a typical coronavirus, containing the characteristic gene order (5)-replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid-3)) and short untranslated regions at both termini [9] [10] [11] .",

The PCR amplification consisted of 3 steps including denaturation at 94\u00b0f or 10 s, annealing at 50 or 54\u00b0 for 1 min, and extension at 68\u00b0 for 2.5 min. The 3 steps were repeated for 40 cycles. The nested PCR was performed as follows: 50 \u00ccl of reaction solution contains 1 \u00ccl of multiplex PCR product, 0.2 \u00ccM of each nested PCR primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1! Taq buffer, and 1 unit Taq polymerase. The PCR condition included denaturation at 94\u00b0 for 1 min, annealing at 56\u00b0f or 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0 for 2 min, and these 3 steps were repeated for 35 cycles. The PCR products were resolved on agarose gels, and the proper PCR fragments were excised from gels and then purified using a commercial kit (Qiaex II Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen Inc.). DNA sequencing was performed using the di-deoxy chain termination method as described in Big Dye TM Terminator cycle sequencer and using an ABI 310 machine (Applied Biosystems Inc., Calif., USA). The primers used for sequencing will be provided on request. Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV genomes was carried out by ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/index.html). figure 1 . The PCR product of SARS-CoV is a fragment of 368 bp using specific primers ( fig. 2) . Among 87 cases of SARS suspects examined, 3 were positive for the SARS-CoV. These 3 cases were further used for sequencing analysis of entire genomes.",

            "text": "We developed a rapid method to sequence and analyze the whole genome of SARS-CoV from clinical specimens. It has been reported that some pathogenic microbes undergo adaptation in response to laboratory culturation. Host-mediated mutations in several viruses have been documented, such as HIV, Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, Sendai and influenza A viruses [17] [18] [19] [20] . Molecular evolution studies using such sequences may be at risk of the data containing laboratory factors [16] ; the analytic data that do not represent random samples of natural pathogen populations or the sampling design is unknown. In this study, we can directly detect the whole genome of SARS-CoV from clinical samples, so that it will avoid the bias mentioned above. Although TC1 (a clinical specimen) and TWC (an isolate) were from the same patient, phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were located at different positions of the phylogenetic tree. Our results confirmed that the sequences of a cultural isolate may be different from those of a clinical specimen although they are derived from the same origin. We analyzed the sequences of the variant observed in cultural isolates and clinical specimens which were published in GenBank. Interestingly, we found that the nt 3,852 C, 11,493 T and 26,477 G appeared in all the clinical specimens, but only in two of 23 cultural isolates. The nt 3,852 T, 11,493 C and 26,477 T were found in all the cultural isolates except TWC2 and in none of clinical specimens (table 5) . From these discrepancies, these mutations may be most likely due to cultural adaptation, but we are unable to completely exclude the possibility of the shifting of two original different viruses during culturing process.",

In this study, we used multiplex RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS genome in two separate reactions, and the PCR products were further amplified using 15 pairs of nested primers so that the products covered the whole genome in 15 separate tubes. The 15 PCR products were then sequenced. A similar approach has been used to analyze the HN gene of human parainfluenza virus [28] , however, only a small portion of human parainfluenza genomes was analyzed. In contrast to this report, we analyze the whole genome of the biggest RNA virus. Although multiple RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS genome can be used as a detection method, it is difficult to evaluate the quantitative change in the clinical specimens. So, we first amplified the Pol region of SARS virus to detect the virus and evaluate the quantitative changes of SARS virus, and then used multiplex RT-PCR and direct sequencing to analyze the whole genome.",
