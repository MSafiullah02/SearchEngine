Twelve days prior, her peak expiratory flow rate was at her baseline of 400 L/minute and ten days prior to this presentation, she was seen by her pulmonologist who documented that the patient\u2019s asthma was controlled. On day 3 of symptoms, she was screened via telephone, referred to a testing site and tested for COVID-19. The patient increased her use of MDI and nebulized albuterol without relief over the next few days. On day 6 of her symptoms, she was feeling better. However, by day 7 her SOB worsened which prompted her to seek medical attention. In the ED, she was hypoxemic, in sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 129 beats per minute), and audibly wheezing. Chest x-ray (CXR) revealed diffuse bilateral ground glass attenuation. She was admitted and treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin for pneumonia and prednisone 40 mg daily for asthma exacerbation. On day 8, her prior COVID-19 test result returned positive and therefore her antibiotics were discontinued. When lying supine, her oxygen saturation decreased to 88%, but improved to 94% with repositioning and albuterol treatment. She continued to have diffuse wheezing despite treatment until day 9, when her breathing improved and she was no longer hypoxemic. After an uneventful night, she was discharged on day 10, but continued to have SOB and increased need for albuterol for 24 days.",

A COVID-19 test was ordered and she was tested positive. On day 8 she felt slight improvement in SOB and became ambulatory, but the following day she experienced abrupt increase in SOB and developed sharp chest pain with a need to go to the ED. She was treated with bronchodilators and steroids. Her CXR was clear and she was discharged from the ED; however, she continued to have significant wheezing, SOB with minimal exertion , need for albuterol every 4-6 hours and pain in her chest for 26 days.",

Five days later she called the clinic with increased shortness of breath, diarrhea and severe weakness for 2 days. She tested positive for COVID-19 on day 7. Despite increase in her ICS/LABA dose and oral steroids, she continued to have severe cough, SOB, chest pain and no appetite.

He was on his way to the ED, but was advised to stay home due to the increase of COVID-19 patients and a nurse was sent to his home for treatment and evaluation. He was found to be in respiratory distress, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and home oxygen. A nasopharyngeal sample was taken which turned positive for COVID-19. He continued to have fever, SOB, cough, body aches and nausea, and remained bedridden for 3 weeks. He gradually improved after 20 days, but his cough and SOB remained to the point of needing nebulized albuterol every 4-6 hours for 27 days.",

All cases needed ED visits, with two being admitted to the hospital. In all patients, the respiratory symptoms fluctuated. In three cases patients perceived improvement immediately prior to the peak of symptoms and their need for ED visits. All four patients stated symptoms of dyspnea and general exhaustion occurred at an intensity not experienced during previous asthma exacerbations. They also noted the duration of respiratory symptoms was much longer than previous asthma exacerbations. All four patients noted minimal improvement with recurrence within 2 hours of respiratory symptoms after albuterol use. This provides insight into potential manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with underlying asthma.",

Indeed recent CDC reports indicate that chronic lung disease in 18-49 years old age groups is the second most prevalent underlying condition, and that this was driven primarily by asthma.(6)",

Wheezing, which is not a symptom associated with COVID-19, was present in all of the patients. Two out of four that had blood work showed leukopenia. Furthermore, all four patients had a history of allergic rhinitis to tree pollen. Tree sensitivity is another variable that may have impacted their asthma status and/or response to this virus and cannot be excluded as a cause for their exacerbation. Although the previous study showed limited association between atopy and COVID-19 infection, again this might not be applicable to our patient population and needs to be further investigated. (2) Additionally, obesity was identified in two of these patients who required admission indicating a possible accumulative risk. Obesity is a known risk factor for poor outcome in asthma and appears to impact their outcome in the setting of COVID-19 infection.",
