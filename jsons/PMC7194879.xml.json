Unchanged CD4:CD8 ratio and a significant increase in CD8 MFI may indicate that the immune response of infected persons to COVID-19 virus is maintained by maintaining normal CD4:CD8 ratio and by increasing CD8 cell marker expression level. Since, CD8 molecule is important for T-cell activity, T lymphocytes try to increase their cytotoxic activity by increasing CD8 protein [23]. However, some viral diseases, such as AIDS, have associated with a decrease in CD8 molecule, which the difference could be due to the short duration of COVID-19 infection compared with the long duration of chronic infection of AIDS [23]. The findings of this study shed light on changes in immunologic markers in COVID-19 patients. Conducting such studies in larger populations and on other immunologic markers may open the way for diagnosing and treating this disease.",
