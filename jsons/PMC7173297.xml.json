            "text": "In our study, viral or atypical pathogens were identified in 59.6% of the cases. The detection rate in our study was similar to that of previous studies (35\u201378%),12, 13, 14 and lower than that of the studies performed by Bezerra et al and Calvo et al.15, 16 This could be because we did not detect human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses, which may play an important role in children with bronchiolitis. RSV was the most common pathogen detected in hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis. Manoha et al17 also reported an RSV infection rate of 28.5% (265 of 931), which is consistent with our findings. However, Antunes et al18 reported a rate of 58.1%, but this is most likely due to the fact that the study period was from November 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008, which represents the RSV epidemic season. In addition, 9.0% of the patients in our study had a positive pathogen of MP approximated to other common viruses as well as HBoV (11.6%), HPIV-3 (7.8%), and hMPV (6.6%). Regarding emerging viruses, such as human bocavirus and metapneumovirus, the HBoV detection rate in this study was lower than that reported by Ur\u0161i\u010d et al (18.4%).19 On one hand, the aim of this study only focused on children with bronchiolitis, whereas the study by Ur\u0161i\u010d et al assessed all respiratory infections in children. On the other hand, detected genetic differences may lead to biased results. The human metapneumovirus result is consistent with the results from a South Korean study.20 Importantly, the findings of our study indicate that the role of MP in bronchiolitis cannot be ignored. Some researchers from Thailand have also reported results that are consistent with this study.6\n",

            "text": "In addition, we studied the pathogen circulation for 2 consecutive years, which compensates for annual variations in some pathogen circulations. This study describes, for the first time, the relationship between meteorological conditions and pathogen activity in children with bronchiolitis. Our findings showed that RSV, HPIV-3, MP, hMPV, and IV-A exhibited strong seasonal patterns, with the number of RSV, hMPV, and IV-A cases peaking during the winter and spring seasons and the number of MP, HPIV-3, and ADV cases peaking during the spring and summer seasons. Importantly, these results are consistent with previous studies.14, 17, 21, 22 There are several reasons for the seasonality of certain bronchiolitis pathogens, including the effects of meteorological conditions on the survival and spread of infectious pathogens in the environment, the variable susceptibility of the population to bronchiolitis, and the varying possibility of pathogen transmission by the host behavior due to the different meteorological conditions.23, 24, 25 The study by du Prel et al,26 which assessed 19 pathogens of acute respiratory infection in patients in Germany, showed the same results as ours, with the exception of HPIV-3 and MP. In that study, the authors showed that the number of HPIV-3 and MP cases was inversely correlated with temperature, whereas we found that the number of those cases was positively correlated with temperature. We hypothesize that the different climates at the locations of the two studies contributed to these differences. The city of Mainz in Germany has a marine climate with very little change in temperature throughout the year, whereas our city has a subtropical monsoon climate that has a wide range of temperatures through the year. Therefore, further studies are needed to explain these observed differences. Our study also presented an inverse correlation between pathogen activity and total sunshine exposure. It is hypothesized that ultraviolet light (UVB) radiation could interfere with the spread of RSV and hMPV by inactivating the virus in nature. UVB could also indirectly affect RSV and hMPV activity by stimulating vitamin D metabolism in the host,27 which can increase the expression of some antiviral proteins as well as cathelicidin and defensins in the host to defend against virus invasion.28\n",

HBoV and MP bronchiolitis presented more frequently in older infants than RSV, which is consistent with previous findings.15, 29 Moreover, RSV bronchiolitis caused more severe hypoxia and audible wheezing without auscultation than MP, hMPV, HPIV-3, and IV-A bronchiolitis. Chan et al30 reported that RSV infections in younger children led to higher oxygen demand than hMPV infections, and these findings were confirmed in our study. No significant difference was found in the severity of disease between RSV and HBoV or coinfections. The role of viral coinfections in the pathogenesis of disease is still unclear, and different opinions regarding the severity can be found in the literature.16, 31, 32 In light of these conflicting reports in infants with bronchiolitis, additional larger scale and multicenter studies are needed to identify the significance of this issue.",
