Since coronaviruses in general infect the mucosal surfaces, both respiratory and enteric, they may be used to target the antigen to the enteric and respiratory areas to induce a strong secretory immune response (Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst, 1995); (iv) the tropism of coronaviruses may be modified by the manipulation of the spike (S) protein allowing engineering of the tropism of the vector (Ballesteros et al., 1997, Leparc-Goffart et al., 1998, S\u00e1nchez et al., 1999, Kuo et al., 2000); (v) non-pathogenic coronavirus strains infecting most species of interest (human, porcine, bovine, canine and feline) are available to develop expression systems (S\u00e1nchez et al., 1992); and (vi) infectious coronavirus cDNA clones are available to design expression systems (Almazan et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2000, Thiel et al., 2001).",

These viruses can be classified according to the nature of their genome (one or more RNA fragments) and their expression strategy, for instance, a single mRNA encoding a polyprotein that is processed into functional proteins or a collection of mRNAs each encoding a protein. Expression systems based on positive-strand RNA viruses that are transcribed in a single mRNA molecule, such as picornaviruses (poliovirus) (Andino et al., 1994), and more recently flaviviruses (Khromykh and Westaway, 1994, Khromykh and Westaway, 1997, Chambers et al., 1999) have been developed. The alphaviruses (Togaviridae family), encoding a full-length mRNA and a subgenomic mRNA, are among the most advanced expression systems (Liljestr\u00f6m, 1994, Frolov et al., 1997, Pushko et al., 1997, Caley et al., 1999). The alphaviruses include the Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and are very efficient at eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses.",

However, HCoV have languished at the bottom of many lists of human pathogens because of the difficulty in isolating and characterizing the agents during outbreaks of illness (Denison, 1999). In addition, infections of man by coronaviruses seem to be ubiquitous, as coronaviruses have been identified wherever they have been looked for, including North and South America, Europe, and Asia and no other human disease has been clearly associated to them with the exception of the respiratory and enteric infections (Denison, 1999).",

Both families are included in the Nidovirales order (Enjuanes et al., 2000a, Enjuanes et al., 2000b). Recently, a new group of invertebrate viruses, the okaviruses, with a genetic structure and replication strategy similar to those of coronaviruses, has been described (Cowley et al., 2000). The coronaviruses have been classified in three groups that comprise the members listed in Table 1\n. The murine coronaviruses (MCoV) have been extremely useful to study gene expression using systems based in two components, a helper virus and a minigenome in which the heterologous gene was inserted. The advanced state of the research performed with coronaviruses and arteriviruses led to the development of single genome expression systems based in both virus families. Infectious cDNA clones are available for porcine (Almazan et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2000) and human (Thiel et al., 2001) coronaviruses, and for the arteriviruses equine infectious anemia virus (van Dinten et al., 1997, de Vries et al., 2000) and the porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Meulenberg et al., 1998). The availability of these cDNAs and the application of target recombination to coronaviruses (Masters, 1999) have been essential for the development of vectors based on the Nidovirales.",

Sequences at the 5\u2032 end of each gene represent signals for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998). These sequences, known as TRSs include a stretch of a highly conserved sequence designed the core sequence (CS), located at sites immediately upstream of most of the genes. The CS presents some variation in sequence length among the coronaviruses, being 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032 for TGEV, or a related sequence, depending on the coronavirus (i.e. UCUAAAC for MHV). In previous reports the CS has been named intergenic sequence (IS). Since often genes overlap in the Nidovirales, the acronym IS does not seem appropriate in these cases and the acronym CS could reflect the nature of the highly conserved sequence contained within the TRS. Coronavirus mRNAs consist of six to eight types of varying sizes, depending on the coronavirus strain and the host species. The largest mRNA is the genomic RNA which also serves as the mRNA for ORF 1a and 1b and the remainder are subgenomic mRNAs. The mRNAs have a nested-set structure in relation to the genome structure (Fig. 2B). Except for the smallest mRNA, all of the mRNAs are structurally polycistronic. In general, only the 5\u2032-most ORF of each mRNA is translated. However, there are exceptions: some mRNAs, e.g. mRNA 5 of MHV, mRNA 3 of IBV and BCoV nucleocapsid mRNA are translated by internal initiation into two or three proteins (Lapps et al., 1987, Krishnan et al., 1996).",

Most of the M protein is embedded within the membrane but its carboxy-terminus is integrated within the core and seems essential to maintain the core structure (Escors et al., 2001). The TGEV M protein presents two topologies. In one, both the amino- and the carboxy-terminus face the outside of the virion, while in the other the carboxy-terminus is inside (Risco et al., 1995). In addition, the virus envelope contains two or three other proteins, the S protein, the small membrane protein (E) and, in some strains, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) (Enjuanes et al., 2000a). The ratios of S:E:M:N proteins vary in different reports. For purified TGEV, these ratios have been estimated to be 20:1:300:140, respectively (Escors et al., 2001). The S protein is large, ranging from 1160 to 1452 amino acids, and in some coronaviruses is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. The S protein is responsible for attachment to cells, hemagglutination, membrane fusion and induction of neutralizing antibodies.",

This approach was initially developed by Masters\u2019 group (Masters, 1999). First, the engineering of a five nucleotide insertion into the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of MHV via targeted recombination with an in vitro synthesized RNA was reported (Fig. 4\nA) (Koetzner et al., 1992). This approach was facilitated by the availability of an N gene mutant, designated Alb4, that was both temperature sensitive and thermolabile. Alb4 forms tiny plaques at restrictive temperature that are easily distinguishable from wild-type plaques. In addition, incubation of Alb4 virions at non-permissive temperature results in a 100-fold greater loss of titer than for wild-type virions (Koetzner et al., 1992). These phenotypic traits allowed the selection of recombinant viruses generated by a single cross-over event following cotransfection into mouse cells of Alb4 genomic RNA together with a synthetic copy of the smallest subgenomic RNA (RNA7) tagged with a marker in the 3\u2032 UTR.",

This higher efficiency made it possible to screen for recombinants even in the absence of selection. In this manner, the transfer of silent mutation in gene 1a of a minigenome to wild-type MHV at a frequency of about 1% was demonstrated.",

Thus, two silent mutations have been created thus far in gene 1 (van der Most et al., 1992). The S protein has also been modified by targeted recombination. Changes were introduced by one crossover event at the 5\u2032 end of the S gene that modified MHV pathogenicity (Leparc-Goffart et al., 1998). Targeted recombination mediated by two cross-overs allowed the replacement of the S gene of a respiratory strain of TGEV by the S gene of enteric TGEV strain PUR-C11 leading to the isolation of viruses with a modified tropism and virulence (S\u00e1nchez et al., 1999). In this case, the recombinants were selected in vivo using their new tropism in piglets. A new strategy for the selection of recombinants within the S gene, after promoting targeting recombination, was based on elimination of the parental replicative TGEV by the simultaneous neutralization with two mAbs (Fig. 4B) (Sola et al., 2001b).",

Now, for the first time, construction of infectious coronavirus cDNA clones is possible (Almazan et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2000, Thiel et al., 2001). Construction of the TGEV full-length cDNA was started from a DI that was stably and efficiently replicated by the helper virus (M\u00e9ndez et al., 1996, Izeta et al., 1999). Using this DI, the full-length genome was completed and the performance of the enlarged genome was checked after each step. This approach allowed for the identification of a cDNA fragment that was toxic to the bacterial host. This finding was used to advantage by reintroducing the toxic fragment into the cDNA in the last cloning step. In order to express the long coronavirus genome and to add the 5\u2032 cap, a two-step amplification system that couples transcription in the nucleus from the CMV promoter, with a second amplification in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase, was used. In addition, to increase viral cDNA stability within bacteria, the cDNA was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), that produces only one, maximum two plasmid copies per cell. BACs have been useful to stably clone large DNAs from a variety of complex genomic sources into bacteria (Shizuya et al., 1992), including herpesvirus DNA (Messerle et al., 1997).",

Using this cDNA the GFP gene of 0.72 kb was cloned into the RNA genome by replacing the non-essential 3a and 3b genes (Fig. 5B), leading to an engineered genome with high expression levels (>20 \u03bcg/106 cells) and stability (>20 passages in cultured cells) (Sola et al., 2001a). Using the TGEV derived cDNA expression system, the induction of lactogenic immunity in swine has been demonstrated. This immune response led to the acquisition of immunity by newborn piglets (I.

In contrast, the theoretical cloning capacity for an expression system based on a single coronavirus genome like TGEV may be 3.1 kb taking into account that: (i) the non-essential 3a and 3b genes (1.0 kb) have been deleted; (ii) the standard S gene can be replaced by that of PRCV mutants with a deletion of 0.67 kb; and (iii) both DNA and RNA viruses may accept genomes with sizes up to 105% of the wild-type genome (Bett et al., 1993, Parks and Graham, 1997, Afanasiev et al., 1999). This cloning capacity most likely will be enlarged in the near future when non-essential domains of the replicase gene, with more than 20 kb, could be identified. The present cloning capacity of the coronavirus vectors (around 3 kb) is within the range expected, since other RNA virus vectors, such as those derived from the VEEV, with a genome of around 12 kb, accept inserts of about 1 kb in size that are expressed during ten serial tissue culture passages. Larger genes in the order of 2.5 kb can also be expressed by the vector but are not tolerated as well by these viruses (Caley et al., 1997). Accordingly, in SFV and Sindbis virus expression system recombinants with smaller inserts (e.g. <2 kb) tend to be more stable than those with larger inserts, such as the \u03b2-galactosidase gene (about 3 kb) (Bredenbeek and Rice, 1992).",

Because the leader-mRNA junction occurs within this CS sequence or its minus-sense counterpart (cCS) the CSs are considered to be crucial for mRNA synthesis. The sequence of the cCS probably influences transcription throughout at least two types of recognition events: (i) one related to the potential basepairing between the leader 3\u2032 end, complementary to the cCS, that guides the fusion between the leader and the body of the mRNA (Fig. 6A\u2013B); and (ii) the recognition of the primary or secondary structure within the neighborhood of the cCS, that may cause formation of a bridge between the CS and the 3\u2032 end of the leader, mediated by protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interaction (Lai, 1998). According to this model, the cCS should act as a classical promoter where transcription is initiated. Alternatively, this sequence may slow down or even detach the transcriptase complex, according to the discontinuous transcription during negative-strand RNA synthesis model (van der Most and Spaan, 1995, Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998, van Marle et al., 1999).",

Cloning short oligonucleotides ranging from 10 to 18 nt, comprising the CS sequences in MHV minigenomes, showed that these sequences alone were sufficient to direct subgenomic DI RNA synthesis (van der Most et al., 1994). A series of deletions in the sequences flanking the cCS reduced mRNA production, demonstrating that the sequence flanking the CS 3\u2032-AGAUUUG-5\u2032 affected the efficiency of subgenomic DI RNA transcription (Makino et al., 1991, Joo and Makino, 1992, Makino and Joo, 1993, van der Most et al., 1994). TRS activity became optimal in MHV when a sequence of 18 nt from a region showing full complementarity to the 3\u2032 end of MHV genomic leader was used (Shieh et al., 1987, Makino et al., 1988, La Monica et al., 1992).",

An increase in the TRS length, that leads to an increase in the potential hybridization with the 3\u2032 end of the leader, allows the introduction of more than one mutation without a significant decrease in the mRNA production (Fig. 7B). In TGEV, the presence of the CS 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032 led to mRNA transcription, but deletion of the \u2018U\u2019 or a change in the second \u2018C\u2019 led to the complete abrogation of mRNA transcription (Alonso et al., 2001a).

Using site-directed mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA clone of the EAV it has been shown that subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis requires basepairing interaction between the leader TRS and the complement of a body TRS in the viral negative strand (Fig. 6). EAV TRS core consists of the CS pentanucleotide 5\u2032-UCAAC-3\u2032. It has been shown that mRNA synthesis is probably governed by a direct basepairing interaction between the plus leader TRS and the complement of the TRS. Using TRS mutants with reduced transcriptional activity, evidence was obtained showing that the TRS sequence at the leader-body junction of the sgRNA is derived from the body TRS. This finding supports the idea that sgmRNAs are generated by a mechanism of discontinuous minus strand synthesis (van Marle et al., 1999). The sequences at the 3\u2032 end of the leader complementary to the TRS core are part of a single-strand RNA loop helping its potential interaction with the cCS. In TGEV, the equivalent sequences are also predicted to be mostly within a single-strand RNA loop at the 3\u2032 end of the leader.",

Nevertheless, the accumulated amounts of subgenomic mRNA remained nearly the same for the three constructs with one to three CSs because the minigenome with three CSs was replicated with lower efficiency than those with two or one CS copy. Similarly in IBV, expression of CAT under the control of TRSs composed of two tandem repeats of the canonical octameric IBV CS sequence \u2018CUUAACAA\u2019, showed that either CS sequence can function as acceptor sites for mRNA synthesis but transcription preferentially occurred at the 3\u2032-most TRS (Stirrups et al., 2000).",

The limited stability of the helper dependent expression systems is most likely due to the foreign gene since TGEV minigenomes of 9.7, 3.9 and 3.3 kb, in the absence of the heterologous gene, are amplified and efficiently packaged for at least 30 passages, without generating new dominant subgenomic RNAs (M\u00e9ndez et al., 1996, Izeta et al., 1999). The recombination frequency in MHV, TGEV, and IBV seems inversely proportional to the stability of the recombinants expressing a foreign gene. In fact, the MHV based helper dependent expression system has the lowest stability probably because of the higher recombination frequency within this system (Lai, 1996).",

The accumulation of mutations during the in vitro expression of minigenome RNAs with T7 DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase is 10\u22124\u201310\u22125 consisting mostly of 1-nt insertions and deletions (Boyer et al., 1992, Sooknanan et al., 1994). After transfection of the in vitro produced RNA, synthesis of mRNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase should have an accumulation of mutations with a relatively higher frequency of 10\u22123\u201310\u22124 (Ward et al., 1988, de Mercoyrol et al., 1992). An improvement in expression stability should be observed by using expression systems initiated by DNA transfection, such as those based on the expression of the minigenomes under CMV promoter, since in these cases an eukaryotic RNA polymerase II expresses the minigenome with an estimated error frequency of 5\u00d710\u22126 on synthetic polynucleotide substrates (de Mercoyrol et al., 1992).

Interestingly, while porcine and human aminopeptidases show species-specificity, the feline aminopeptidase seems to serve as a receptor for feline, canine, porcine and HCoV (Tresnan et al., 1996, Benbacer et al., 1997). Group 2 coronaviruses use the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) as receptors (Beauchemin et al., 1999). The S protein is also responsible for cell entry of group 2 coronaviruses such as MHV. In these viruses, the S glycoprotein is cleaved into two covalently associated 90-kDa subunits, the amino-terminal S1 and the carboxy-terminal S2 subunits (Frana et al., 1985, Luytjes et al., 1987). It is believed that the S1 subunit forms the membrane-bound stalk portion (de Groot et al., 1987a). A receptor binding activity has been demonstrated in studies using recombinant protein containing the amino-terminal 330 residues of the S1 subunit of MHV-JHM (Kubo et al., 1994).",

The S glycoprotein domain recognized by the cellular receptor (pAPN) on ST cells is located within the globular domain of the protein encoded between nucleotides 1518 and 2184. This domain is present both in enteric and respiratory porcine coronaviruses, indicating that its presence in a virus is not in itself sufficient to infect the enteric tract. In fact, it has been demonstrated that a second factor mapping in the S gene around nucleotide 655 drastically influences the enteric tropism of the PUR46 strain of TGEV (Ballesteros et al., 1995, S\u00e1nchez et al., 1999).",
