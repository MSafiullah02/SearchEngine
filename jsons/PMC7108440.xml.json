            "text": "Traditional viral culture, usually in combination with direct immunofluoresence (DIF), is the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory infection. However, these methods are insensitive, laborious, have prolonged turn-around times, and cannot detect all recognised viral respiratory pathogens. PCR is more sensitive and specific than traditional methods and can be used to detect fastidious viruses. Real-time PCR is at least as sensitive as nested gel-based PCR protocols and offers increased rapidity (results available within the working day). The use of specific labelled probes ensures easy interpretation when used in a multiplex format. We describe four triplex TaqMan\u2122-based RT-PCR methods adapted from published methods and further developed in-house for the diagnosis of 12 viral respiratory pathogens.",

Real-time RT-PCR assays for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (Mackay et al., 2003), RSV A and B (van Elden et al., 2003), and coronavirus 229E and OC43 (van Elden et al., 2004) were published previously. Although the primers for the detection of influenza A and influenza B, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza 1 and 2 were from previously published methods (Bredius et al., 2004, Templeton et al., 2004), TaqMan\u2122 probes for these pathogens were adapted from the original molecular beacons. In-house real-time RT-PCR methods were developed for coronavirus NL63 and parainfluenza 3 using Beacon designer 2.0 (Premier Biosoft International) and Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). Conserved target regions were identified using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Regions within the 1a and haemagluttinin genes were chosen for coronavirus NL63 and parainfluenza 3, respectively. The primers and probes were shown to detect all submitted NL63 and parainfluenza 3 sequences. No interfering secondary structures were observed using the mfold algorithm (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu).",
