The urinary bladder should be emptied before performing paracentesis. Infiltrate a small area with local anesthetic, if desired. Use a 20-to 22-gauge needle or over-the-needle catheter to penetrate the abdomen. Attempt to obtain fluid in four quadrants, allowing the fluid to flow freely by gravity and capillary action. If needed, gentle suction with a 3- or 6-ml syringe can be employed. For a complete description of the technique, the reader is referred elsewhere (Ford and Mazzaferro, 2006). Allow the animal to rest quietly while fluid is being removed. Moving the animal or allowing the patient to move while the needle is in the abdomen can result in laceration of the organs. Some investigators prefer to have the patient standing for fluid removal; however, it is more likely that the omentum will occlude the needle if the patient is in a standing position.",

Also at collection, make both direct unconcentrated smears by a squash or blood smear technique and smears from spun samples. Romanowsky-type stains such as Wright stain or an aqueous-based Wright (quick) stain can be applied to a few slides for immediate in-house evaluation. The remaining unstained smears, as well as an EDTA and serum tube filled with fluid, should be submitted to the laboratory. This will allow the clinical pathologist evaluating the sample to compare the cellularity of the sample and the appearance of the cells at the time of collection with that which was submitted in the tube.",

Both methods offer accurate readings in a wide range of protein concentrations (George, 2001; George and O'Neill, 2001). It has been shown with canine effusions that refractometry underestimates the protein content when < 2.0 g/dl and that the spectrophotometry using the biuret method is more accurate when there is high protein content (Braun et al., 2001). Others have found that refractometry can be used accurately down to 1.0 g/dl (George and O'Neill, 2001). A similar finding of underestimating protein content in feline effusions with refractometry may occur (Papasouliotis et al., 2002). In that same study, a dry chemistry analyzer produced increased globulin concentration and therefore lower Albumin:Globulin (A:G) ratios when compared with a reference wet analyzer using the same biuret and bromocresol green methodologies (Papasouliotis et al., 2002). This finding is particularly important since decreased A:G ratios support a diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (Hartmann et al., 2003).",

With this information, one can begin to narrow down the list of possible causes for the abnormal fluid accumulation. For samples being submitted to a reference laboratory, placing some of the sample in a lavender-top tube (EDTA) and some in a red-top tube is recommended. The lavender-top tube contains anticoagulant, which prevents the sample from clotting if there is a high protein content. EDTA is bactericidal, however, and is contraindicated if a sample is to be cultured (Songer and Post, 2005). Thus, some of the fluid should also be put into a red-top tube or sterile tube without additives. The cell counts will be done either with a hemocytometer or an automated cell-counting instrument. If the amount of fibrinogen in the fluid sample is high, then the sample in the red-top tube is likely to clot, producing erroneous results.",

Some causes for transudate accumulation include severe hypoalbuminemia, portal hypertension, hepatic insufficiency, portosystemic shunt, and early myocardial insufficiency. The cells commonly found in transudates are similar to those in normal fluid, which are mostly mononuclear cells consisting of macrophages, small lymphocytes, and mesothelial cells (see Fig. 6-6A).

The accumulation of transudative fluid in a body cavity causes increased pressure, which is irritating to the mesothelial cells lining the space. They respond by proliferating and sloughing into the effusion. With time, the sloughed mesothelial cells die and in so doing release chemoattractants that draw small numbers of phagocytes into the effusion to remove cellular debris. The result is a mild increase in both total protein (\u22652.5 g/dl) and nucleated cell count (less than 5,000/\u03bcl). Thus, modified transudates are generally transudates that have been present long enough to elicit a mild inflammatory reaction (see Fig. 6-6B). It is most often associated with cardiovascular disease or neoplastic conditions.",

The gross appearance of these fluids is the result of high lipid content (due to higher cholesterol content than serum) but is in no way related to a true chylous effusion, as there are no triglycerides or chylomicrons present (Hillerdal, 1997; Tyler and Cowell, 1989). The phagocytes attracted to remove cellular debris from transudates are rich in enzymes that digest protein but are virtually devoid of enzymes that will break down complex lipids.

Classification as an inflammatory effusion is based primarily on the presence of high total protein (often >4.5 g/dl) which is a reflection of a similar elevation in serum protein. Electrophoresis of either the effusion fluid or the serum reveals a polyclonal gammopathy. An albumin-to-globulin ratio of less than 0.8 on the fluid is very suggestive for FIP. It has been reported that if gamma globulin is greater than 32% of the protein in the effusion fluid, this is suggestive of FIP (Shelly et al., 1988). An additional test that can help rule in or rule out FIP is the Rivalta test. To perform this relatively simple test, place one drop of 98% acetic acid into 5 ml distilled water and mix well in a reagent tube. Then add slowly one drop of the effusion fluid to the surface of the acetic acid solution. A positive test requires that the drop of effusion retain its form on the surface or slowly sink to the bottom as a droplet or jellyfish-like shape (Fig. 6-9A\n). This test indicates a high protein content as well as fibrin and inflammatory mediators. This test has a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 97% (Hartmann et al., 2003). A more specific cytologic test for FIP involves immunofluorescence of intracellular feline coronavirus (FCo V) within effusion macrophages. When positive (Fig 6-9B), this test is diagnostic for FIP; however, the negative predictive value is 57%, so a negative test may miss cases of FIP (Hartmann et al., 2003).",

Whereas most cases of septic pleuritis and peritonitis are signaled by the presence of predominantly degenerating neutrophils, in nocardial and actinomycotic effusions the majority of the neutrophils away from the organisms are nondegenerate. Degenerating neutrophils are only seen immediately in the vicinity of the bacterial organisms because these agents, in contrast to most other bacteria, produce only weak local toxins. The net effect of this phenomenon is that smears in these cases may be easily misinterpreted as noninfectious, particularly if the organisms are not widespread.

When associated with diaphragmatic hernia, leakage of bile occurs when liver is trapped in the diaphragmatic rent and there is necrosis of the gall bladder or common bile duct. In this circumstance, both peritonitis and pleuritis can result. Bile is a very irritative substance; its presence quickly elicits an inflammatory response. Grossly, the fluid may be initially brown (see Fig. 6-1G) to yellow to greenish; however, as the response becomes more and more cellular, this discoloration may become masked.

In reactions of greater duration, bile granules may have all been converted to rhomboidal to amorphous golden crystals of bile pigment. When such crystals are found in the cytoplasm of effusion phagocytes in the absence of evidence of prior hemorrhage (e.g., erythrophagocytosis), the possibility of bilious effusion should be strongly considered. In addition to the typical appearance of bilious effusions, acellular, amorphous, fibrillar blue-grey mucinous material (Fig. 6-13A\n) has been associated with biliary tree rupture, particularly of the common bile duct in dogs (Owens et al., 2003). Instead of the green or yellow bile granules present, lakes of extracellular material are the predominant cytologic finding. It is suspected that this bile-free material is produced by biliary and gallbladder epithelium as a consequence to extrahepatic biliary obstruction with regurgitation of normal bile into hepatic lymph and venous blood.",

In one study in cats, creatinine or potassium was increased in fluid and served as a useful predictor for uroperitoneum, generally in a ratio of 2:1 compared with that in serum (Aumann et al., 1998). Simultaneous evaluation of fluid and serum creatinine should show a higher creatinine in the fluid, as it equilibrates much slower than urea nitrogen (BUN).

Causes for chylous effusions in the thoracic cavity include cardiovascular disease, neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma, thymoma, and lymphangiosarcoma), heartworm disease, diaphragmatic hernia, lung torsion, mediastinal fungal granulomas, chronic coughing, vomiting, or idiopathic (Fossum, 1993; Fossum et al., 1986a; Forrester et al., 1991; Waddle and Giger, 1990). In one study (Fossum et al., 1986a). Afghan hounds appeared to have a higher incidence of chylothorax compared to other breeds of dogs.

As with carcinomatous effusions, at least five definite nuclear criteria of malignancy must be seen before a presumptive diagnosis is made (Fig. 6-29A\u2013C\n).",

The pericardium is notorious for eliciting mesothelial hyperplasia. These mesothelial cells become very large and basophilic, often binucleate with prominent nucleoli (see Fig. 6-3B) and mitotic figures. It is often not possible to distinguish these reactive mesothelial cells from possible neoplastic cells. In addition, hemangiosarcoma may cause pericardial hemorrhage, but neoplasia of mesenchymal origin typically will not shed neoplastic cells into effusions. In one study (Sisson et al., 1984), 74% of 19 neoplastic effusions were not detected on the basis of cytologic findings and 13% of 31 non-neoplastic effusions were falsely reported as positive, leading the authors to conclude that pericardial fluid analysis did not reliably distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic disorders. More recently, cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been evaluated in pericardial fluid. Results from this study involving 37 dogs suggest that cTNI may be useful in differentiating idiopathic pericardial effusions from those caused by hemangiosarcoma (Shaw et al., 2004).",

In a study of 51 dogs with pericardial effusions, the pH of the fluid was examined and compared with a final diagnosis (Edwards, 1996). When measured by precise instrumentation, the pH indicated that a reading greater than 7.3 was likely due to noninflammatory conditions, usually neoplasia. Using a less accurate urinary dipstick, pericardial fluid pH = 7.0 was associated with neoplasia in 93% of the cases, while <7.0 suggested benign or non-neoplastic conditions. The pH of the fluid needs to be measured shortly after obtaining the sample. A recent study found similar results; however, considerable overlap was detected, thus limiting the usefulness of pH to differentiate the etiology of pericardial effusions (Fine et al., 2003).",
