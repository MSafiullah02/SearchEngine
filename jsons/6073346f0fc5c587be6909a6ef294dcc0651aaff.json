Most companion animal vaccines, until recently, had a 1 year DOI and carried a recommendation for annual revaccination. The sensible response of industry to recent discussions about vaccine safety has been to increasingly license products with an 'extended' (generally 3 year) DOI.

Consequently, guidelines advice will often differ from that given in the data sheet; however, any veterinarian may use a vaccine according to guidelines (and therefore current scientific thinking) by obtaining informed (and documented) owner consent for this deviation from legal recommendations ('off-label use').

There is little doubt that in most developed countries the major infectious diseases of dogs and cats are considered at best uncommon in the pet population, but there do remain geographical pockets of infection and sporadic outbreaks of disease occur, and the situation regarding feral or shelter populations is distinctly different to that in owned pet animals. However, in many developing countries these key infectious diseases remain as common as they once were in developed nations and a major cause of mortality in small animals. Although it is difficult to obtain accurate figures, even in developed countries it is estimated that only 30-50% of the pet animal population is vaccinated, and this is significantly less in developing nations. In small animal medicine, we have been slow to grasp the concept of 'herd immunity'-that vaccination of individual pet animals is important, not only to protect the individual, but to reduce the number of susceptible animals in the regional population, and thus the prevalence of disease. Herd immunity with the core vaccines that provide a long (many years) DOI is highly dependent on the percentage of animals in the population vaccinated and not the number of vaccinations that occur annually. Therefore, every effort should be made to vaccinate a higher percentage of cats and dogs with the core vaccines.",

For that reason we have seen the development of vaccination guidelines based on a rational analysis of the vaccine requirements for each pet, and the proposal that vaccines be considered 'core' and 'non-core' in nature. To an extent this categorization of products has been based on available scientific evidence and personal experience -but concerted effort to introduce effective companion animal disease surveillance on a global scale would provide a more definitive basis on which to recommend vaccine usage. In parallel with the categorization of vaccines has been the push towards marketing products with extended DOI, to reduce the unnecessary administration of vaccines and thereby further improve vaccine safety. Both of these changes have necessitated a frame-shift in the mindset of veterinary practitioners in a culture in which both veterinarian and client have become subservient to the mantra of annual vaccination.",

The VGG recognizes that particular countries will identify additional vaccines that they consider core. A particular example of a vaccine that may be considered core in only some countries is that against rabies virus. In a geographical area in which this infection is endemic all dogs should be routinely vaccinated for the protection of both the pet and human populations. In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel.

No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. The recommendation of the VGG is for initial vaccination at 8-9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3-4 weeks later, and a third vaccination given between 14-16 weeks of age. By contrast, at present many vaccine data sheets recommend an initial course of two injections. Some products are also licensed with a '10 week finish' designed such that the second of two vaccinations is given at 10 weeks of age. The rationale behind this protocol is to permit 'early socialization' of pups. The VGG recognizes that this is of great benefit to the behavioural development of dogs. Where such protocols are adopted, great caution should still be maintained by the owner -allowing restricted exposure of the pup to controlled areas and only to other pups that are healthy and fully vaccinated. The VGG recommends that whenever possible a third dose of core vaccine be given at 14-16 weeks of age.",

Therapeutically, the serum or immunoglobulin preparations are injected subcutaneously and quickly reach the circulation. Not unexpectedly, intravenous infusions of plasma (not serum) have been found to work as well but this is a more difficult practice that must be used with caution. In local infections, such as those initiated by the bite wound of a rabid carnivore, post-exposure antibody prophylaxis has also proven invaluable. Human rabies immune globulin provides rapid protection when given on the first day of the post-exposure prophylaxis regimen.

The vaccine is a subunit product containing GP63 of L. donovani (also known as the 'fucose mannose ligand') in saponin adjuvant. It is considered to induce antibody that blocks the transmission of the organism from the dog to the sand fly vector by preventing binding of Leishmania to the midgut of the sand fly. The vaccine appears compatible with serological testing to identify infected dogs, as only 1.3% of 5860 vaccinated uninfected animals were positive in the tests used in that screening programme. More importantly, large scale epidemiological studies have shown that vaccination has an additive effect to the culling programme with regions having high uptake of vaccination showing reduced incidence of both canine and human infection (Palatnik de Sousa et al., 2009) .

In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel. In terms of feline core vaccines it is important to realize that the protection afforded by the FCV and FHV-1 vaccines will not provide the same efficacy of immunity as seen with the FPV vaccines.

In general, MDA will have waned by 8-12 weeks of age to a level that allows an active immunological response, and an initial vaccination at 8-9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3-4 weeks later is commonly recommended. Many vaccines carry data sheet recommendations to this effect. However, kittens with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until sometime after 12 weeks of age.

Accordingly the recommendation 'left leg leukaemia, right leg rabies' suggested that FeLV vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the left hind limb, whilst rabies vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the right hind limb. A recent study has evaluated the effect of this practice by comparing the anatomical distribution of FISS in cats before the recommendation was made (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) and after the practice was adopted (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . These data show a significant decrease in the prevalence of interscapular FISS and an increase in prevalence of tumours in the right (but not left) hind limb. More notably, there was also an increase in the number of tumours reported arising in the right and left lateral abdomen, and this was attributed to the difficultly of injecting into the distal hindlimb and these abdominal sites being accidentally injected (Shaw et al., 2009 ).",

The purpose of pre-licensure safety studies is to detect relatively common adverse events. Rare adverse events will be detected only by post-marketing surveillance through analysis of reported adverse events. Adverse events should be reported to the manufacturer and/or the local regulatory authority. In many countries governmental surveillance schemes are not available and reactions should therefore be notified to the manufacturer. The VGG recognizes that there is gross under-reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events which impedes knowledge of the ongoing safety of these products. The VGG would actively encourage all veterinarians to participate in such surveillance schemes.",

In addition, reported adverse events can lead to detection of previously unrecognized reactions, detection of increases in known reactions, recognition of risk factors associated with reactions, identification of vaccine lots with unusual events or higher numbers of adverse events, and can further stimulate clinical, epidemiological, or laboratory studies. Therefore, veterinarians are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event occurring during or after administration of any licensed vaccine. Reporting a vaccine adverse event is not an indictment against a particular vaccine; it facilitates review of temporally associated conditions and adds to the safety database of the product.",
