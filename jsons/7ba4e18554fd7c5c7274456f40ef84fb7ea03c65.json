Hospitals are often part of multi-hospital systems with web portals for the entire network of hospitals. In our estimation, websites of sampled hospitals represented about 1200 hospitals, one-fifth of all US hospitals.",

We excluded other versions of urgent care including online algorithms (e.g., \"symptom checkers\") or audio-only services.",

General availability included the presence or absence of virtual visits and relevant exclusions. Navigation started from the main hospital system website, with attempts to proceed logically to virtual urgent care, or \"virtual visits.\" If that failed, a separate search was conducted with the hospital's name and \"virtual visits.\" We included virtual visits with real-time, audio-visual connectivity for urgent care. Websites were accessed March 23-April 2, 2020. Table 1 ); however, restrictions were common: About onefifth of virtual visits were not publicly accessible. Even among hospitals with publicly accessible virtual visits, further limitations included geographic limitations (i.e., accessing care across state lines) and exclusions for chronic health conditions. Ease of navigation was variable. Some virtual visit links were advertised on the main page, while others required more thorough searches.",
