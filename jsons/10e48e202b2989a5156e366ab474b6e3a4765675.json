To detect virus in the samples, we conducted PCR by using the TaKaRa PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with a pair of degenerate pan-orthohepadnavirus primers (sequences available upon request). The PCR reaction was as follows: 45 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 54\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Positive results were obtained for 22 long-fingered bats (Miniopterus fuliginosus). Of these bats, 2.19% (7/320) were from Sedon County and 4.69% (15/320) from Wutao County; the viruses they harbored shared >98% nt identity.

We analyzed the genome structure by using Vector NTI Advance 10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The results showed that the bat hepatitis viruses (BtHVs) contained the same circular and compact genomic structure as other orthohepadnaviruses, comprising 4 open reading frames encoding the multifunctional Pol, preS1/preS2/S, preC/C, and X proteins in the same direction (Figure 1, panel A) .",

We homogenized the pooled tissues in SM buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1M NaCl; pH7.5), followed by clarification by low-speed centrifugation to remove cell debris. We then passed the pooled sample through a 0.22-\u00b5m syringe filter (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland). Polyethylene glycol 6000 was added, and the resulting precipitate was sedimented at 12,000 \u00d7 g in a desktop centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for 40 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended and examined after negative staining in a JEM-1200 EXII transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Numerous spherical particles of \u224820 nm diameter were observed ( Figure 2 ). The particles were morphologically similar to the Australia antigens of HBV, the most abundant viral component found in HBV-infected humans and animals and also known as surface protein or S antigen (6, 7) . PCR amplification of DNA extracted from the virus pellet revealed the full genome of the BtHV, with the expected size of \u22483200 bp (image not shown).",

These bats have a wide distribution (8) , and increasing numbers of viruses, including coronaviruses and betaherpesviruses, are being isolated from them (9, 10) . Of the 6 bat species we sampled, only M. fuliginosus was positive for BtHV. The prevalence of BtHV-positive bats in the 2 counties from which we obtained bats, was 2.2% and 4.7%, respectively, indicating that this species is likely a natural reservoir host of BtHV. The lack of detection of BtHV in bats from the other 5 species may be due to the limited numbers of bats sampled (although no evidence of hepadnavirus was found in any of the 176 R. ferrumequinum bats) or to a narrow host range of the virus. Further study is required to determine the tropism and prevalence of BtHVs in other bat species.",

Boxes and arrows represent the open reading frames encoding the main proteins: pol gene (2,305-1,636), preS1/S2 and S gene (2,864-833), preC/C gene (1,815-2,468) and X gene (1,378-1,812). Two 12-nt direct repeat sequences (DR1 from 1,825 to 1,836 and DR2 from 1,594 to 1,605), the encapsidation signal e (1,848-1,903), and YMDD domain (734-745) are also depicted in the map. B) Phylogenetic analysis of BtHVs and other hepadnaviruses based on amino acid sequences of pol genes. Representatives of hepadnavirus species belonging to Orthohepadnavirus and Avihepadnavirus genera were used; their GenBank accession nos. are shown in the trees. The different genotypes of human hepatitis B virus are also included. The 3 BtHV isolates are identified by black triangles. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.",
