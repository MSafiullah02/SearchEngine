However, human limitations and the complex nature of health care systems are contributing factors that make errors an expected phenomenon (1). A systematic review by Nabhan and colleagues found that the most frequently used definition of preventable harms is \"presence of an identifiable, modifiable cause of harm\" (2) . Preventable harms that occur during hospital stays are also known as hospital harms, patient safety incidents, hospital adverse events or hospital errors. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI ) defines hospital harms as the \"rate of acute care hospitalizations with at least one occurrence of unintended harm during a hospital stay that could have been potentially prevented by implementing known evidence-informed practices\" (3). caused by procedure-associated conditions. They also reported that during the same period, 670 incidences of obstetric hemorrhage were caused by health care or medication associated conditions and 960 incidences were caused by procedure associated-conditions. In addition, 855 birth trauma incidences were caused by health care or medication-associated conditions and 1417 incidences were caused by procedure-associated conditions.",

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Framework for Safe, Reliable and Effective Care identifies processes of improvement and measurement as a part of the health care learning system (14) . In the UK, an ethnographic study of a maternity unit with an excellent record for patient safety found that staff partly attributed its success to a maternity dashboard which facilitated audit and feedback (15) . The Better Outcomes Registry & Network (BORN Ontario) developed a dashboard of six key clinical performance indicators to measure data relating to the quality of maternal and newborn patient care in Ontario, Canada (16) (17) (18) . In a pilot study, a quality improvement project focusing on one of the indicators identified by BORN, led to a welcome and significant reduction in the rate of elective repeat caesarean sections (ECRS) in low risk women at less than 39 weeks' gestation (19) . In an interrupted time series study that evaluated postimplementation effectiveness of the maternal newborn dashboard, the researchers found that it led to improvements in four of the six key indicators (20) . A systematic review by Ivers and colleagues (21) found that audit and feedback can lead to small improvements in the practice of care delivery by health care professionals. In a rapid review, Anthony and colleagues found that audit and feedback in combination with other obstetrical safety initiatives may reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality (22) .",

For this review, we will use the definition of patient safety indicators used by Kristensen and colleagues i.e. measures that directly or indirectly monitor preventable hospital harms (29) . For these indicators it is important to map indicators to goals which are actionable. In the field of obstetric patient safety, there is a need to identify indicators which measure the aspects of care that relate to preventable harms caused by medical errors. This can be challenging because it is not always clear which indicators should be used and there are variations in practice and outcomes across hospitals, regions etc.",

Firstly, we will screen the titles and abstracts of records that are not randomized trials to determine eligibility for inclusion against the agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria using screening software (Covidence). Secondly, we will screen 30 randomised trials to see if they identify additional indicators. If this step is not useful, we will not screen the remaining randomised trials. Thirdly, two reviewers will independently screen the full-text records for which it was not clear whether they met inclusion criteria in the previous screening phase. If there is disagreement regarding the inclusion of a record(s), another reviewer will assess the full text. We will undertake interrater reliability testing after every 1,000 records screened.",
