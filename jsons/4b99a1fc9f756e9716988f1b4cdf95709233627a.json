In fact, the pandemic has created an unprecedented natural experiment teaching us valuable lessons about patient care that can be both long-lasting and life-saving. Herein, we provide an example of local coordinated response to COVID-19 from the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), a large, diverse, tertiary-care center and liver transplant program in the U.S. with a catchment area extending up to 160 km.",

We have also leveraged the EHR to proactively generate reports on cancelled patient visits. From 1 March 2020 to 26 April 2020, 910 individual patients with advanced liver disease or post-transplant were originally scheduled in outpatient clinics. Of those, 505 (56%) appointments were kept as scheduled, 334 (37%) were rapidly rescheduled and, 12 (1.3%) are scheduled in the future, and 60 (6.6%) have yet to be rescheduled. Building on our previous experience, we shifted up to 69% of our visits to telemedicine within a 6-week period (Figure 1 ). 2 We have initiated home-based, remote monitoring for decompensated cirrhosis using UPENN's online portal 3 that interfaces with patients' or caregivers' cellphones to monitor symptoms enrolling 35 patients in the first week of program initiation.",

While surveillance for HCC could be delayed for a couple of months until we achieve re-entry and \"the new normal\", those patients currently willing to accept HCC surveillance are undergoing imaging studies. Further, high MELD patients continue to be transplanted at our center as these procedures are clearly nonelective. 6 We have been quite judicious, but uncompromising by limiting outpatient laboratory exposure for our patients with cirrhosis and after liver transplant, while recently transplanted patients have been provided home nurse or mobile laboratory blood drawing to follow essential care parameters.",

It is not yet clear how many needed hospitalizations were deferred in the community or what long-term sequelae this may have. We also recognize that patient perceptions alter their willingness to accept routine blood tests and imaging studies that could also negatively impact quality of care.
