Older people tend to be frail, with multiple comorbidites, rendering them more susceptible to infectious disease. At the same time, they are at greater risk of exposure to the disease, because of their frequent use of hospital services. The spread of infectious disease within hospitals and nursing homes is a public health concern. Therefore, the most effective way of preventing the disease spread is to avoid hospitalization. Close collaboration among the community geriatric team, Department of Health, and nursing homes is of vital importance to manage their problems in the nursing home as much as possible and to provide early detection of the disease to prevent a rampant spread.",
