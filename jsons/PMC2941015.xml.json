            "text": "One major distinction between HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2 is the unique presence of vpu in the former. The main function of Vpu is to expedite the spread of viral progeny (1). Vpu is a small, versatile protein that is capable of interacting with a wide range of host proteins, including \u03b2TrCP (2), UBP (3), CD74 (4), BST-2/tetherin (5,6), CAML (7), and background two-pore K+ (K2P) channel TASK (8). BST-2/tetherin and TASK are capable of suppressing HIV-1 release by direct interaction with Vpu (5\u20138). BST-2/tetherin has been proposed to counteract Vpu-mediated release by retaining, or gluing, the viral membrane to the host plasma membrane after fission. However, BST-2/tetherin also inhibits viral release in diverse classes of viruses that lack Vpu, so the mechanism of Vpu-mediated release is likely complex and involves multiple cellular/physiological processes (9\u201313).",

TASK conductance limits the rate of Vpu-mediated viral release, whereas Vpu oligomerization with TASK exerts a dominant-negative effect on the normal assembly and function of TASK channels. Of note, the first transmembrane segment of TASK-1 (Ttm1) alone is capable of destroying the normal assembly of TASK and enhancing HIV-1 release just like Vpu. The fact that these two distinct activities can be solely elicited from the expression of a unique transmembrane structure shared by both Vpu and Ttm1 suggests a coupled mechanism (8). Because K2P channels set resting potentials in many types of cells (25), we sought to determine whether membrane potential stability is detrimental to viral particle release, in which case Vpu could promote viral release by destabilizing the cell membrane potential.",

Marban, unpublished) (Fig. 1). Several point mutations in this region of TASK-1 (R38A, R40A, and AQA (R38A and R40A)) resulted in different levels of protein expression and channel activities (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Material and Fig. 2 A). TASKR38A had very low protein expression and thus did not conduct currents in the transfected cells, whereas TASKR40A and TASKAQA exhibited protein levels comparable to that of wild-type TASK. However, the latter two mutants showed functionally distinctive profiles. Therefore, we used these three mutants to test our hypothesis for the mechanism of Vpu-mediated release. These point mutations did not affect the expression of Vpu or the protein-protein oligomerization between TASK and Vpu in the heterologously expressed HEK-293 cells (Fig. S1). However, the interaction between Vpu and each mutant led to very different functional consequences. Both TASKR40A and TASKAQA exhibited fivefold higher single-channel activities than wild-type TASK, but Vpu inhibited only TASKAQA (70\u201380% inhibition, the same as for the wild-type channel in Fig. 2 B). TASKR40A, with a single-channel conductance threefold that of TASKAQA or the wild-type, maintained its currents and the cell membrane potential upon Vpu coexpression (Fig. 2). TASKR40A also outperformed TASK and TASKAQA in restricting Vpu-mediated viral release (80% vs. 50% inhibition in Fig. 3). On the other hand, TASKR38A, with very little protein expression (Fig. S1), did not exhibit any detectable channel activities (Fig. 2) or the ability to suppress Vpu-mediated release (Fig. 3). We observed that when TASK currents remained substantial, Vpu-assisted release was stagnant. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the magnitude of background K+ conductance and the efficiency of Vpu-mediated release. Conceivably, suppression of the stabilizing background K+ currents could unleash viral particle release.",

Our results suggest that the process of HIV-1 release was similarly affected by \u0394\u03c8 (Fig. 4). To dissipate the restricting electric field across a budding membrane, Vpu probably acts like a membrane depolarizer that diminishes the stabilizing background K+ currents. Indeed, when heterologously expressed in IL-2-activated, human CD4+ T cells, Vpu induced 15\u201320 mV of membrane potential depolarization. This Vpu activity functionally resembled that of TASK siRNA in dissipating the endogenous background K+ conductance in T lymphocytes (34): both were capable of depolarizing transmembrane potentials and reducing membrane sensitivity to extracellular K+ (Fig. 5). Others have shown that Vpu heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes also inhibits K+ permeation (15). Thus, the function of Vpu is intrinsically linked to its propensity to oligomerize destructively with endogenous K+ channel subunits such as TASK (8,17).",

We adopted two methods to test the effects of depolarization on release. In the first approach, we depolarized cell potentials by knocking down the endogenous TASK channels in HeLa cells expressing vpu-inactivated HIV-1 (NL4-3/Udel), and found that this alone promoted viral release up to sevenfold (Fig. 6). Knockdown of endogenous TASK1/3/5 elevated the rates of virus release more effectively in the absence of Vpu than in the presence of Vpu. Since HIV-1 particles are heterogeneous, the induced particles by membrane potential depolarization were also examined for infectivity. The viral particles released from the cells treated with TASK1/3/5 siRNA showed infectivity comparable to the particles from the cells treated with the nonspecific siRNA (Fig. S2). Thus, depolarization-induced viral particles are functional. This result is reminiscent of an early finding that particles derived from vpu-inactivated HIV-1 NL4-3/Udel are as infectious as those derived from NL4-3 (28), reinforcing the notion that membrane potential depolarization by either TASK siRNA or Vpu primarily affects the final fission step and not the earlier steps (e.g., packaging).",

In HeLa cells expressing NL4-3/Udel, high K+-imposed depolarization enhanced virus release up to sevenfold (Fig. 7). Depolarization-induced viral release was significantly less pronounced in the cells expressing complete HIV-1 (NL4-3). The high-K+ effect was more evident in the absence of Vpu (Fig. 7), pointing to an occlusive mechanism involving membrane potential depolarization. The results again support the notion that there exists a transmembrane voltage constraint for viral release that can be sufficiently dissipated by HIV-1 Vpu. To the extent that Vpu may form homo-oligomers, the channels thus formed may further attenuate \u0394\u03c8 to promote viral fission and release (16,17,36).",

This discovery was based on earlier findings that the effect of Vpu on release enhancement is cell-type-dependent (37). For example, the efficiency of viral release in HeLa and human CD4+ T cells is greatly enhanced by Vpu, whereas the efficiency in HEK-293T cells is Vpu-independent. Furthermore, because Vpu is capable of facilitating the release of widely divergent retroviruses, the mechanisms used by Vpu to promote release are likely intrinsic to various types of host cells (38). Studies that examined differences in gene expression between Vpu-dependent (e.g., HeLa) and Vpu-independent (e.g., HEK-293T) cell lines showed that BST-2 is expressed in Vpu-dependent cells but not in Vpu-independent cells, and is an endogenous restricting factor against viral release (5,6,9). It has been suggested that the rate of release in Vpu-independent (permissive) cells is not affected by Vpu expression because their endogenous BST-2 is too low to counteract Vpu effectively to limit the release. In contrast, in Vpu-dependent (restrictive) cells, viral release is limited in the absence of Vpu due to the comparably higher endogenous BST-2 levels. However, the protective effect of endogenous BST-2 in the restrictive cells can be diminished by Vpu expression, which allows acceleration of viral release (5).",

It has been proposed that Vpu antagonizes BST-2 by accelerating degradation of BST-2 through its interaction with \u03b2TrCP and other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system (39,40). Thus, whether a cell type is permissive or restrictive appears to be influenced by the expression levels of the endogenous restriction factors. This notion also fits our mutant data, in which the degree of release enhancement by Vpu was directly proportional to the magnitude of inhibition Vpu imposed on background K+ conductance (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "To integrate the BST-2 model with the proposed depolarization mechanism, we investigated whether the effects of background K2P channel activities on HIV-1 release were also cell-type-dependent. We first determined the endogenous TASK levels in HEK-293 (permissive) versus HeLa (restrictive) cells, and then assessed their impact on Vpu-mediated release. Current clamp experiments revealed that HeLa cells had more polarized resting membrane potentials than did HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 A). Based on the degrees of membrane potential depolarization by TASK siRNA, HeLa cells expressed significantly more TASK than HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 A). Knockdown of endogenous TASK depolarized both cell lines to similar voltages, indicating that TASK1/3/5 channels were primarily responsible for setting cell membrane potentials in these cell lines (Fig. 8 A). Because HEK-293 cells expressed smaller background K+ conductance than HeLa cells, they were likely to impose smaller restricting \u0394\u03c8 on particle release. Indeed, membrane potential depolarization induced by elevated [K+]out enhanced NL4-3/Udel release up to 2.5-fold in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 B), and the enhancement was not as large as in HeLa cells (Fig. 7). On the other hand, release enhancement by depolarization was much smaller (\u226650%) in the presence of Vpu for both cell lines (Figs. 7 and 8 B), again suggesting depolarization as a triggering mechanism for Vpu-mediated release. Because elevation of extracellular K+ drove different cells to the same depolarized potentials, particle release from HEK-293 cells, which had smaller restricting \u0394\u03c8, was affected less by depolarization than release from HeLa cells (Figs. 7 and 8 B). A comparison of the results from HEK-293 versus HeLa cells (Figs. 7 and 8) shows that their different degrees of NL4-3/Udel release enhancement by depolarization reflect the different degrees of membrane potential polarization (or, in essence, TASK expression) of the two cell lines. Conceivably, the size of background K+ conductance could also help determine whether a particular cell type is permissive or restrictive.",

Moreover, BST-2 was not expressed in HEK-293 cells at all (Fig. S3), whereas TASK channels were expressed in both HEK-293 and HeLa cells, with a higher level in the latter (Fig. 8 A). The endogenous expression of TASK channels in HEK-293 cells allowed viral release to be enhanced by depolarization through high K+ media (Fig. 8 A) or TASK knockdown (data not shown).

We hypothesize that dissipation of this energy barrier essentially reduces the contact repulsion between the two apposing membranes to be fused.

Activation of background K2P channels such as TASK leads to hyperpolarization and suppression of the excitatory drive and secretion (31,41). In motoneurons, activation of native TASK-like current using the inhalational anesthetic halothane also leads to hyperpolarization and suppression of neuronal firing (33). In a study of adrenal glands, inactivation of native TASK depolarizes the membrane potentials, leading to enhancement of aldosterone secretion (32). Analogous inhibition of another background K2P channel, TREK-1, by corticotropin, promotes cortisol secretion in bovine adrenal fasciculate cells (30). Although HIV-1 release differs importantly in its mechanistic details from secretion/exocytosis processes, they can all be induced by a destabilized electric field. The channel-like structure of Vpu enables it to depolarize the budding membrane, making particle release an energetically favorable process. Its unique presence in HIV-1 conceivably contributes to the particularly high transmissibility and disease progression of HIV-1 as compared to HIV-2 or other lentiviruses.",
