            "text": "Red cell alloantigen exposure can cause alloantibody-associated morbidity. Murine models have suggested that inflammation modulates red cell alloimmunisation. This study quantifies alloimmunisation risks during infectious episodes in humans. We performed a multicentre case-control study within a source population of patients receiving their first and subsequent red cell transfusions during an 8-year follow-up period. Patients developing a first transfusion-induced red cell alloantibody (N = 505) were each compared with two similarly exposed, but non-alloimmunised controls (N = 1010) during a 5-week 'alloimmunisation risk period' using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Transfusions during 'severe' bacterial (tissue-invasive) infections were associated with increased risks of alloantibody development [adjusted relative risk (RR) 1\u00c134, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0\u00c197-1\u00c185], especially when these infections were accompanied with long-standing fever (RR 3\u00c106, 95% CI 1\u00c157-5\u00c196). Disseminated viral disorders demonstrated a trend towards increased risks (RR 2\u00c141, 95% CI 0\u00c189-6\u00c153), in apparent contrast to a possible protection associated with Gram-negative bacteraemia (RR 0\u00c158, 95% CI 0\u00c113-1\u00c114). 'Simple' bacterial infections, Gram-positive bacteraemia, fungal infections, maximum C-reactive protein values and leucocytosis were not associated with red cell alloimmunisation. These findings are consistent with murine models. Confirmatory research is needed before patients likely to develop alloantibodies may be identified based on their infectious conditions at time of transfusion.",

Anti-D immunised patients were not taken into consideration because we were unable to discriminate whether anti-D was caused by unmatched transfusions, or (mainly regarding fertile women) was due to recent anti-D administration in the context of a D-positive pregnancy or transfusion. Patients who formed antibodies, yet either lacked exposure to a (documented or assumed) antigen-positive red cell unit or expressed the antigen themselves (i.e. auto-immunised patients) were deemed ineligible. In addition, alloimmunised patients were excluded if their first-time alloantibody positive screen occurred within 7 days of the first mismatched transfusion, as these were more likely to represent boosting of earlier primary immunisations. By consulting the nationwide alloimmunisation registry (http://www.sanquin.nl/producten-diensten/diagnostiek/trix), we additionally excluded patients previously diagnosed with alloimmunisation in other hospitals. Considering the abovementioned criteria, we specifically aimed to exclude previously alloimmunised patients, including pregnancy-induced immunisations in women. Finally, haemoglobinopathy patients and infants below 6 months of age were not included.",

An 'alloimmunisation risk period' was then constructed, stretching from 30 days before up to 7 days after this implicated Nth transfusion. A similar risk period around the Nth transfusion was determined for the matched controls. The implicated transfusion and its alloimmunisation risk period are illustrated in Fig 1.

Consequently, we used the following strategy. First, we identified a subset of covariates to be confounders of a given determinant based on their observed association with the determinant within the source population (i.e. the nonalloimmunised controls). Such an association was defined as The implicated transfusion and alloimmunisation risk period. The last antigen-mismatched transfusion preceding the first serological detection of an antibody was defined as the 'implicated (or Nth) transfusion' since this transfusion was the most likely to influenc alloimmunisation. To exclude possible boosting events, this implicated transfusion was required to precede the first positive screen by at least 7 days (i.e. lag period). An alloimmunisation risk period was then constructed starting 30 days before and finishing 7 days after this implicated transfusion. Controls received at least the same number of red cell units as their matched case. A similar alloimmunisation risk period around the Nth matched transfusion was constructed.",

Covariates in the causal pathway between the determinant and the outcome were not considered as confounders (Hernan et al, 2002) . Second, to be able to accurately control for confounders with low prevalences, we estimated a probability score for each determinant using logistic regression with the potential confounders as predictors (Brookhart et al, 2013) . Third, to minimize bias due to missing data on the confounders, we used multiple imputation. Details on the used imputation model can be found in the Data S1 and Table SI . Finally, we evaluated the association between various types of infections and red cell alloimmunisation by subsequently entering the corresponding probability scores into the logistic regression model with alloimmunisation as the outcome and conditioning on the matched variables. We next assessed the association of level of CRP values and leucocytosis as possible markers of inflammation with red cell alloimmunisation. Leucocytosis was categorized as maximum measured leucocyte counts of 10-15, 15-20, 20-30 and >30 9 10 9 /l, and referenced to normal counts (4-10 9 10 9 /l). Maximum measured CRP values were categorized as 30-100, 100-200, 200-300 and >300 mg/l, and referenced to values \u226430 mg/l. Missing CRP and leucocyte values were multiply imputed using the same strategy as described above. While the likelihood that an increased inflammatory parameter has been recorded at least once increases with the number of measurements and thus with the duration of hospitalization, we repeated these analyses limited to parameters measured within the week following the implicated transfusion. As elevated CRP levels and leucocytosis reflect various clinical conditions preventing causal inferences, they are presented here only as unadjusted RRs.",

An existing molecular mimicry between certain viral peptides and CD4 + T-cell red cell antigen epitopes was also suggested, although observed effects in polyomavirus infected mice did not reach statistical significance (Hudson et al, 2010) .

            "text": "Third, we observed a twofold alloimmunisation incidence reduction during Gram-negative bacteraemia. Analogous to viral infections, these findings require confirmatory research. Yet, they again corroborate animal experiments showing significantly attenuated alloimmunisation responses upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pretreatment in mice (Hendrickson et al, 2008) . LPS, an endotoxin in the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, strongly stimulates innate immunity by agonizing TLR4 on macrophages and dendritic cells. Conversely, LPS is also implicated in a transient, possibly self-protective immune paralysis, known as LPS tolerance (Lauw et al, 2000; Weijer et al, 2002; Gould et al, 2004) . Restimulation with LPS in this respect initiates blockage of CD4 + T cell functioning via impaired release of tumour necrosis factor a, interleukin (IL)12 and IL18 from monocytes and dendritic cells, together with a diminished upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class-II and costimulatory molecules (Mattern et al, 1998; Gould et al, 2004) . While regulatory T cells selectively express TLRs (including TLR4), their LPS-induced proliferation might also contribute to the observed effects in both mice and humans (Caramalho et al, 2003) . Finally, we cannot exclude an indirect role for Gram-negative bacteraemia on red cell alloimmunisation due to their common association with other modulators. Indeed, suppressed mitogenic B and T lymphocyte responses were observed following administration of antibiotics, including cephalosporins, an antibiotic class frequently used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections (Borowski et al, 1985; Pomorska-Mol et al, 2015) .",

As the duration of alloimmunisation modulation is currently unknown and will also probably differ per risk factor, we chose a seemingly large risk period to precede the implicated transfusion. Although one could argue that this strategy could possibly dilute some effects, on the other hand, it assures inclusion of most factors of influence at the time of exposure. For example, repeated LPS exposure might induce a state of tolerance persisting for up to 30 days (Cross, 2002) . In addition, a recent study showed that poly(I:C) facilitates red cell alloimmunisation for at least 14 days with its maximum effect reached 7 days after administration (Elayeb et al, 2016) . As a validation of our chosen risk period length, a sensitivity analysis on infections diagnosed during the week preceding or following the implicated transfusion did not change our conclusions (data not shown). Similarly, only the duration of fever accompanying severe bacterial infections, rather than its timing in the risk period, affected alloimmunisation. As we aimed to target the most likely first initiation of an alloimmune response, we limited the risk period to the first 7 days following the implicated transfusion.",

As such, our chosen lag period of 7 days might not completely have prevented the exclusion of patients demonstrating recall responses, including women immunised due to prior pregnancies. Direct antiglobulin tests were not performed on a routine basis shortly following transfusion and as such were of no help in identifying these patients. However, as non-RhD alloantibodies form in only 0\u00c133% of first trimester pregnancies (Koelewijn et al, 2008) , we believe that a substantial influence of previous pregnancies is unlikely. Moreover, erroneously considering a substantial amount of boosting reactions as primary alloimmunisation events would have biased our RRs towards the null-effect. Indeed, a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded the 53 patients in whom alloantibodies were discovered during the second week following their first antigenincompatible transfusion did not substantially change RRs (data not shown). In conclusion, we believe the eventual bias due to our choice of the lag period to be small. Fourth, to avoid invalid inferences due to misclassification, we did not define patients with a non-established aetiology of their inflammatory phenotype as exposed patients. For example, for a vascular compromised patient diagnosed with osteomyelitis, wound cultures positive for Staphylococcus Aureus might have represented normal skin flora colonization of a primary ischaemic wound. Consequently, the analysis on severe bacterial infections did not include this patient. A sensitivity analysis confirmed our results not to be affected by this possible misclassification bias.",

An alloimmunisation risk period was then constructed starting 30 days before and finishing 7 days after this implicated transfusion.
