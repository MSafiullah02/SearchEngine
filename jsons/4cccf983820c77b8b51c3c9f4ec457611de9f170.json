In children, a chronic cough (>4 weeks) is associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. One common cause of childhood chronic cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), especially in children aged <6 years. PBB is characterized by a chronic wet or productive cough without signs of an alternative cause and responds to 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Most children with PBB are unable to expectorate sputum. If bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are performed, evidence of bronchitis and purulent endobronchial secretions are seen. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens typically reveal marked neutrophil infiltration and culture large numbers of respiratory bacterial pathogens, especially Haemophilus influenzae. Although regarded as having a good prognosis, recurrences are common and if these are frequent or do not respond to antibiotic treatments of up to 4-weeks duration, the child should be investigated for other causes of chronic wet cough, such as bronchiectasis. The contribution of airway malacia and pathobiologic mechanisms of PBB remain uncertain and, other than reduced alveolar phagocytosis, evidence of systemic, or local immune deficiency is lacking. Instead, pulmonary defenses show activated innate immunity and increased gene expression of the interleukin-1b signalling pathway. Whether these changes in local inflammatory responses are cause or effect remains to be determined. It is likely that PBB and bronchiectasis are at the opposite ends of the same disease spectrum, so children with chronic wet cough require close monitoring.

Consequently, we altered our original definition of PBB to a more pragmatic one (Table 1 ). This acknowledges the multiple causes of chronic wet cough in children. 7, 9 Diagnostic Criteria Validity While the initial PBB criteria were derived from clinical observations, each of the initial PBB criteria have now been validated. For criterion-(i), for example, chronic wet cough (>4 weeks), our urban-based study of parental recognition of wet cough showed excellent agreement with pediatric pulmonologists (kappa (k) \u00bc 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.93) and bronchoscopic findings of endobronchial secretions (area under the receiver operating curve \u00bc 0.85, 95%CI 0.77-0.92). 10 Also, prospective 11, 12 and retrospective 13 studies have demonstrated that BAL cultures from children with chronic wet cough have respiratory bacterial densities (!10 4 CFU/ml) indicating lower airway infection. Further, increased amounts of secretions detected on bronchoscopy were associated with increased likelihood of infection and airway neutrophilia. 11 The original criterion-(ii) required BAL specimens to have positive respiratory bacterial cultures !10 4 CFU/ml, 8 which is a threshold often used for diagnosing lower airway infection. [14] [15] [16] The common pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) reported initially in PBB 8 have been reaffirmed by several other groups. 13, [17] [18] [19] Finally, a Cochrane review of two randomized controlled trial (RCTs) found that antibiotics (criterioniii) improved the odds of curing chronic wet cough in children odds ratio (OR) \u00bc 7.7 (95%CI 3.1-16.7). 20 Although both RCTs were limited by small numbers (total n \u00bc 140), they nevertheless provided experimental data that supported clinical observations.
