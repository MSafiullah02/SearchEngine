Our healthcare systems are over stressed, and we are seeing worldwide challenges unlike any before. The lack of PPE, the hesitancy of many to seek appropriate medical care because of the fear of exposure, quarantine, the impact of travel bans and free assembly, work force disruptions and the impact of social distancing, facemasks and gloves as well as other restrictive measures have merged to wipe out revenue streams, interrupt global supply chains and interfere with many companies unable to fulfill contractual obligations.",

Force majeure attempts to remove liability for \"natural and unavoidable catastrophes that interrupt the expected course of events and prevent participants from fulfilling obligations\" i . In practice, most force majeure clauses do not excuse a party's non-performance entirely, but only suspend it for the duration of the event ii and only for non-performance if the non-performance is caused by an external, unforeseen and unavoidable event. iii COVID-19 itself may not be the force majeure event, but the consequences of the pandemic (i.e. manufacturing shutdowns, port closures, delays in transportation, etc.) all give rise to potential force majeure claims. Under a force majeure claim, failure to fulfill a contract has to be viewed as impossible and not just difficult or complicated.",

Not having specific \"pandemic\" language isn't the end of the inquiry. The effect of COVID-19 related contractual failures may fall under \"Acts of God,\" \"action by government\" or the ever-popular catch-all provision \"all events outside the reasonable control of the party affected\".",

For example, if an earthquake interruption manufacturing in one area, it might be possible to shift production to another area, however the widespread disruption caused by COVID-19 may eliminate a production shift and other mitigation strategies, A force majeure clause typically allows an extension of time to perform contractual obligations or may suspend contractual performance for the duration of the force majeure event. If the event extends over a long period of time, some provisions may entitle the parties to terminate the contract and find another company that can fulfill a similar obligation. Of course, there is not one scheme to cover this and the reality is that the applicable legal standards vary by state, sometimes with very different outcomes. Legal counsel will have to decide if pursing a force majeure clause is the best strategy or to relay on common law principles.",

In line with that, insurers have largely taken the position that communicable diseases not expressly defined in the policy are not covered. viii Some insurers have released blanket statements regarding COVID-19 confirming that view. ix What are the next steps to help mitigate your issues related to contracts and related performance?
