The first case of MERS in Korea reported on May 20, 2015, was that of an individual who had developed the disease after traveling to the Middle East countries. Subsequently, this case led to the largest transmission cluster of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases in Korea [4]. Among these 186 cases, 36 were treated in our institution.",

Because MERS can be transmitted through direct or indirect exposure to MERS-CoV, infection control in health care facilities is a critical issue [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Patients diagnosed with MERS should be moved to an institutional isolation care unit and personal protective equipment is mandatory for health care workers who handle these patients. Thus, CXR would play a pivotal role in the evaluation of patients with several infectious diseases, including MERS, because it is rapid and easily accessible, compared with computed tomography (CT). Indeed, we relied on the findings of sequential CXR while managing the 36 patients with MERS-CoV infection in clinical practice. However, there is still limited information about the prognostic implication of CXR findings in patients with MERS. Thus, the aim of this study was two-fold. First, we were to describe the serial radiographic characteristics of MERS-CoV pneumonia by analyzing radiographic scores. Second, we tried to identify the earliest cutoff value of radiographic score, which can be considered as a potential prognostic indicator of fatal outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia.",

After 2 days (May 29), he reported that he had met another patient with MERS approximately 10 days ago, at a different hospital. The patient was immediately transferred to an isolation care unit. The MERS-CoV infection was confirmed by a sputum assay on May 30. During his stay in the ER, numerous individuals were in contact with him directly or indirectly. Individuals with a possibility of exposure to this virus were quarantined and laboratory tests were conducted if symptoms were noted during the observational period. Consequently, 81 cases of MERS-CoV infection resulting from the exposure at the ER were confirmed, resulting in a total of 90 cases of MERS-CoV infection diagnosed at our institution [8]. Among the 90 patients, 36 were hospitalized in the isolation care unit of our institution. One patient with underlying stage-four lymphoma was not included in this study, as this condition could adversely affect the prognosis. Thus, 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS were included.",

The parenchymal abnormality on CXR was graded on a 3-point scale: 1, normal attenuation; 2, ground-glass attenuation; and 3, consolidation. The ground-glass opacity was defined as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct [11]. Consolidation appears as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls [11]. Each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones, was then graded based on the following scale (according to the area of the lung affected): 0 if normal, 1 if less than 25% of abnormality, 2 if 25\u201350% abnormality, 3 if 50\u201375% abnormality, and 4 if >75% abnormality was noted. The four-point scale of the lung involvement was then multiplied by the 3-point scale of parenchymal abnormality in each lung zone, resulting in points ranging from 0 to 12 [12,13]. Points from all zones were added to arrive at a final total cumulative score, with values ranging from 0 to 72 (Fig. 1\n).",

Despite the availability of high resolution CT images, CXR is still the most important and commonly used modality in diagnosis and monitoring of highly contagious diseases such as MERS. Our study highlights the clinical implication of radiographic scores as a prognostic indicator in patients with MERS. As the average time to radiographic abnormality was 9.2 days (SD, 2.8 days) from viral exposure, prompt detection of CXR abnormality and acquisition of radiographic score is vital in the management of patients with MERS pneumonia.",

One of unique findings of our study is that we identified the optimal time point and cutoff radiographic scores in patients with MERS pneumonia which could be used as an indicator of respiratory distress. In addition, out study demonstrated that patients\u2019 age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between intubation and non-intubation groups in patients with MERS pneumonia. These results are in contrast with the previous reports, including one by Das et al., which suggested that geriatric immunocompromised patients with MERS are at higher risk of fatal outcomes [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. We found out that development of MERS pneumonia, rather than final outcome, was more frequently noted in patients with comorbidities. Indeed, none of the patients with MERS URI had premorbid conditions. We think that it can explain one of the mechanisms that patient\u2019s comorbidities had finally led to poor prognosis in previous reports. Current study emphasizes the importance of careful CXR monitoring in patients with MERS-CoV infection, regardless of patients\u2019 age and premorbid conditions.",

A recent report by Ko et al., specified the presence of radiographic abnormality, indicating MERS pneumonia in all three patients suspected of super spreading the infection [18]. Therefore, careful evaluation of CXR for detecting pneumonia is critical in the control of MERS outbreak. Additionally, prediction of respiratory failure is also important to avoid urgent intubation or tracheostomy, which can increase the risk of transmission to healthcare workers. The average incubation period of MERS was estimated to be about 5.4 days, and could extend up to 11 days. The results of the current study support the efficacy of two-week quarantine system in patients with virus exposure [19].",

Second, although the radiographic score \u2265 10 on day 10 had the largest predictive power for respiratory failure, it was not found to be statistically significant on multivariate analysis. We think that a small number of study population was a major drawback of our result, which hindered statistical significance. As there is limited number of patients with MERS, we hope that external validation of our radiographic scoring system would be performed by other MERS-CoV research group to establish a role of radiographic score as a prognostic indicator in MERS pneumonia. Third, daily CXRs were not available in most cases, as CXR scans were obtained on every other day in the recovery phase. To overcome the issue, we applied 3-day moving average value of radiographic scores to minimize the potential error. Lastly, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of radiographic score might not be sufficiently high enough. We admit that CXR may not be the most efficient diagnostic or prognostic tool for patients with MERS. However, we should not overlook the clinical utility of CXR as an indispensable modality for patients with this highly contagious disease.",
