There were, respectively, 1, 2, and 30 imported cases (and no community nonimported cases) detected at the beginning date of these 3 surveys. The first local community-infected case with an unknown source of infection was reported on June 10, 2009. The surveys with 3 rounds of data collection (May 7 to June 6, 2009) therefore covered almost the entire \u201cpre-community-outbreak phase\u201d (May 1 to June 10, 2009) of the local epidemic.",

The interviewers brief participants about the details of the study. Verbal consent was obtained before the interview commenced. The study was approved by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. A total of 1621 eligible respondents was identified, and 999 completed the interview. The response rate was hence 62%.",

As in all outbreaks of infectious disease, the control of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic cannot rely only on governmental measures. Personal preventive behaviors are equally important, and individuals need to take responsibility for helping control emerging infectious diseases. This is especially important when the disease has spread widely in the community.

Similar messages were given during the SARS period, as well as for prevention of avian flu and seasonal flu. Such efforts have escalated since the influenza A/H1N1 outbreak occurred and are paying off: frequent handwashing seems to have become a habit of many Hong Kong people, and use of face masks in case of ILI symptoms seems to have become a norm in the Hong Kong community, worn to protect others from contracting influenza. It is known that subjective norms are important determinants of health behaviors. SARS and the series of public health threats resulting from avian flu and influenza A/H1N1 have had a sustained impact on personal hygiene and protective behaviors. Emerging infectious diseases therefore provide a window of opportunity for health education to improve personal hygiene.",

As compared with the first month of the SARS period,14 a much lower percentage of the Hong Kong general public has been wearing face masks regularly in public areas (69.7% vs 21.5%, respectively). This is understandable because SARS is more fatal than influenza A/H1N1. Our data showed that those who perceived that H1N1 had a high fatality were more likely to use face masks in public areas. Governments in different countries seem to be at variance on the advice they give on mask use in public areas, and further research is needed.",

During the study period, no severe cases and no deaths were reported. The hypotheses that the adoption of the 3 types of preventive behaviors was associated with cognitive factors such as perceived efficacy of the preventive measure, perceived chance of having a large scale outbreak, and perceived nonavailability of vaccine were largely supported by the results of this study. Similar factors were identified in the recently published UK study.10 Moreover, similar factors were associated with adoption of different types of preventive behaviors protecting people from contracting SARS12 or human avian flu.13 The similarities are not unexpected because the aforementioned perception factors were derived from general health behavioral theories (such as the health belief model), which can be applied to understanding different types of preventive behaviors. It is hence important to keep track of changes in perceptions toward new emerging respiratory infectious diseases because modification of these perceptions may result in promotion of preventive behaviors.",

A Web-based study conducted in Norway reported the impact of fear and anxiety on people's decision making in the context of imminent influenza pandemic.16 The result revealed that a certain level of fear and concern might lead to desirable preventive behaviors. One challenge for health policy makers and workers is to allay public anxiety without adversely impacting on positively protective behaviors particularly among single, male, and younger people who were less likely than others to use preventive measures to prevent influenza A/H1N1. In this regard, informing people about the mild nature of the virus in general but to remind people about its pandemic nature and risk for mutation may be helpful.",

Second, the response rate of the study was modest, and self-selection bias may exist. However, the age and gender distributions of our respondents were comparable with the 2005 census distributions, which give some support to the generalizability of the study results. Third, reporting bias may also be significant because responses on handwashing and face mask use were self-reported and could not be validated. However, the questions were not sensitive ones, so it is unlikely that social desirability would strongly bias the results. Fourth, this study used a cross-sectional design, so only associations rather than causal effects could be observed.",
