Protecting exposed caregivers from these risks thus appears both as an ethical requirement in terms of distributive justice and as an operational requirement since it helps maximise the number of lives saved. Occupationally exposed healthcare professionals should be granted priority access to critical care treatments if need be. Indeed, the community can fairly expect that these professionals take risks, even mitigated, for the greater good if it ensures that they will be offered the best chances if infected. This is not based on a supposedly higher social utility but merely on the objective of maximising the number of lives saved [10, 12] . This also applies to healthcare professionals deemed high risk because of their age or comorbidities. Protecting them requires ensuring they are not exposed to SARS-CoV-2. If circumstances are such that they are exposed, then this should lead to Page 6 of 17 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ensuring that they have priority access to ICU treatments.

If the crisis develops into an overwhelming situation, relying on such a strategy avoids arbitrary decisions and undue deaths. If it does not, prioritisation simply does not need to be implemented. In all cases, pre-defined prioritisation schemes can be further improved by confronting them with real patient datasets when they become available, but waiting for that time to design these schemes would unduly cost lives if patient overflow occurs in-between. In that matter, anticipation is the first ethical requirement.",

Though already increased, ICU remaining capacity is scarce. Transferring patients to less strained ICUs is also reaching its limits.\uf0b7 Level B: saturation.

P3 Patient does not currently require critical care treatments (or not yet or no longer). Those treatments should be allocated to patients who need them more, and thus have a higher probability to benefit from them. Do not initiate critical care treatment, unless worsening condition prompts reassessment. P4 Despite critical illness, which might lead to critical care treatments out of resource scarcity, probability of the patient benefiting from them is low. It would be unwise to allocate scarce resources which might be missed by patients with a higher probability of benefiting from critical care treatments.
