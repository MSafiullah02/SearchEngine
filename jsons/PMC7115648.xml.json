            "text": "A newly emerging infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS CoV) had significant economic impacts in countries affected by the disease outbreak in 2003\u20132004. The lack of efficient treatments and prevention means the possibility exists for SARS to return in the future. In addition, high-risk populations such as laboratory and hospital workers need effective SARS vaccines for protection. Unfortunately, recent reports have shown that inactivated coronavirus vaccines in a cat model might worsen the disease rather than prevent it [1]. Furthermore, the SARS virus may cause mild liver inflammation in ferrets, and the damage was much more serious if animals were first given a candidate SARS vaccine based on the vaccinia virus [2]. Yang et al. [3] also found that antibodies against SARS CoV S protein enhanced the entry of virus in in vitro cell culture studies. Therefore, in order to generate safe and effective SARS vaccines, we urgently need greater understanding of the immunological responses of vaccine candidates in different animal models.",

The literature indicates that immunization of DNA plasmids that encode the N protein of the Ebola virus and influenza virus elicits protective antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [5], [6], [7]. In avian coronaviruses, N protein-specific T-cell responses were shown to generate protective immunity [8]. These results indicate that a good N protein vaccine candidate should elicit strong cellular immune responses. The N protein of SARS CoV is 422 amino acids long and highly conserved (99%) within different isolates, but it shares only 20\u201330% amino acid homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [9]. In fact, the DNA vaccine candidate encoding the N protein of the SARS CoV fused with calreticulin (CRT) was shown to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in a mouse model, and inhibited replication of the recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed the N protein in vivo [10]. We therefore focused on the N protein of the SARS CoV as the target antigen for subunit vaccine development.",

After disruption using a French Press (Constant Systems, Daventry, UK) at 186 Mpa, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (80,000 \u00d7 \ng for 60 min). Most of the target protein was extracted from the pellet with 8 M urea in homogenate buffer and loaded into 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, San Diego, CA, USA). The resin was washed with the same buffer, and the target protein was purified by changing the pH value. After further washing with pH 6.3 and 5.9 homogenate buffers and 8 M urea, the rN was eluted from the resin using pH 4.5 homogenate buffer and 8 M urea, then the purified rN was refolded by dialyzation against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Like other viruses with spike proteins on the viral surface, coronaviruses have been shown to elicit enhancement of disease through non-neutralizing spike protein-specific antibodies [3], so vaccines that elicit T-cell immunity against SARS proteins are likely to receive more-favorable clinical attention. In animal coronavirus vaccine development, the N protein has been widely tested as an immunogen for protection against coronavirus infections. Inoculation of chickens with plasmid DNA encoding the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) carboxyl terminus of the N protein led to the induction of a specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte population capable of recognizing two distinct IBV strains. In addition, the adoptive transfer of T cells from animals inoculated with IBV to na\u00efve chicks provided CD8+ \u03b1\u03b2 specific protection [13]. A Th1 T-cell line resistant to the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed marked increases in IFN-\u03b3 expression with a decrease in IL-4 production when incubated with MHV-infected cells [14]. Infusion of this resistant cell line into susceptible mice led to complete protection against MHV infection. The immunity against MHV was demonstrated to be a process dependent upon CD8+, perforin, and IFN-\u03b3 in the absence of CD4+ T cells [15]. The generation of IgG2a antibodies following DNA immunization of N protein suggested that there was a significant Th1-type response [16]. With the strong potential protective immunity of N protein-based vaccines, we hypothesized that the SARS CoV N protein would elicit effective immune responses against SARS diseases.",

Different adjuvant formulations induced different immune responses in immunized animals. To assess the immune responses elicited by the rN protein in our BALB/c mouse model, rN protein was formulated with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), a potent adjuvant complex, ISA/CpG, or PBS alone. After three immunizations (50 \u03bcg of rN protein per dose), the N protein-specific antibody responses were measured using ELISA, and results are shown in Fig. 2\nA. The antibody titers were found to be 8 \u00d7 10\u22128, 5 \u00d7 10\u22127, and 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 in the ISA/CpG, IFA, and PBS groups, respectively. To test whether the strong immune response elicited by the rN protein formulated with ISA/CpG was useful in clinical application, we analyzed the subtypes of reactive antibodies from all groups. The isotypes generated in different groups are shown in Fig. 2B; most of the antibodies were IgG1 found in the PBS group (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125), with less IgG2a (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124). There were similar IgG1 titers found in both the IFA and ISA/CpG groups (3 \u00d7 10\u22126). Not surprisingly, the ISA/CpG group generated strong and dominant IgG2a antibodies (1 \u00d7 10\u22126). But the IFA group produced less IgG2a (6 \u00d7 10\u22125). This result indicated that ISA/CpG could drive the immune response toward Th1, and is consistent with previous results which showed that the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide CpG motif could skew the host's immune response toward Th1 [17] and the combination of CpG and ISA-51 also showed the ability to enhance the protective efficacy of a subunit malaria vaccine candidate [11].",

To identify B-cell epitopes of the N protein, mice were immunized with rN protein formulated with either IFA or ISA/CpG. To systemically analyze the B-cell epitopes, each of the peptide pools (NP1\u2013NP8), consisting of 10 consecutive 15-mer overlapping peptides of the N protein, was used to screen against anti-N antisera (see Table 1\n). In this peptide-ELISA assay, we used the rN protein as the positive control and internal standard to normalize the reactivity. Since we desired to determine the immunodominant epitopes, mouse sera were diluted to 1:5000 for epitope screening. When mouse antisera were generated from the group immunized with rN protein formulated with IFA, we found two major reactive peptides pools to be NP1 and NP8. Further individual peptide reactivity analysis showed that peptides no. 8, 72, 73, 78, and 80 contained immunodominant epitopes (Fig. 3\nA). In the ISA/CpG-immunized mouse group, NP4 and NP8 were the two major reactive peptide pools. With further individual peptide screening, we found the major reactive peptides to be nos. 34, 72, 73, 78, and 80 (Fig. 3A). Regardless of which adjuvants were used, the results showed that BALB/c mouse immunodominant B-cell epitopes were located at the C-terminal regions (peptides no. 72, 73, 78, and 80). However, sera from BALB/c mice immunized with \u03b2-propiolactone-inactivated SARS virus recognized the N-terminal region (residues 76\u2013101) of the N protein [18]. These different results could have been due to the nature of the antigens (refolded rN protein versus the inactivated SARS virus) and adjuvants used.",

A computer-based program, BIMAS HLA Peptide Binding Prediction program [12], was used to predict candidate CTL peptides of N protein. Two 9-mer peptides (QFKDNVILL and VWVATEGAL) were identified and synthesized based on the highest score values (Table 2\n). These two peptides were mixed and formulated in ISA/CpG adjuvant with six other 15-mer peptides of N protein that were identified to consist of H2-Kd CTL-binding epitopes. At 7 days after the third immunizations, splenocytes of BALB/c mice were harvested, and various peptides were added to the splenocyte cultures for in vitro stimulation. After 5 days, cytokine secretions of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 were measured using a cytokine-specific ELISA. Only peptide no. 17 (PDDQIGYYRRATRRV) was observed to be capable of stimulating IFN-\u03b3 production (73 pg/ml) (Fig. 6\nA). This result and the T-cell epitope mapping described above confirmed that YYRRATRRV is a very potent functional T-cell epitope.",

Concentrations of CD4+/IFN-\u03b3+ and CD8+/IFN-\u03b3+ cells were found to be 1.35 and 0.22%, respectively (Fig. 6B). The lower CD8+/IFN-\u03b3+ cell population was perhaps due to peptide 17 being a 15-mer peptide that might not have the best match to the MHC class I preferred peptide length (8\u201310-mer peptides).",
