In contrast, the majority of other countries around the world, such as most Latin American countries, still have a universal vaccination program. 12, 13 Although often considered interchangeable, the existence of different strains of the vaccine and their respective use among countries, also serve as a potential confounder to its variable efficacy. 14 The safety record of BCG, along with its immunostimulatory potential, have proven useful for its application in other fields such as in the management of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Used in conjunction with transurethral resection, intravesical instillation of BCG is currently the standard of care for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. 15, 16 The mechanism of action in this setting involves innate and adaptive immune responses; after BCG is internalized in the damaged urothelium, it promotes the recruitment of leukocytes by stimulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. FN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12). 16, 17, 18 Furthermore, BCG has also been used in the management of melanoma and has even been reported to reduce the risk of developing childhood leukemia. 19, 20, 21 Regarding BCG use in autoimmune diseases, some evidence has been found that it might positively affect type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis. 22 The proposed mechanisms in these circumstances are BCG induced up-regulation of the glycolytic pathway and the induction of apoptosis in activated autoreactive T-cells. 23, 24 The properties of the BCG vaccine mentioned earlier (i.e. good safety record and immunostimulatory potential), in addition to its low production cost and it being temperature stable, prove useful when researching recombinant technology. 22 The lack of efficacy to protect adults against TB infection, has led to significant efforts to improve the current BCG.",

Two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain this: cross-protection by heterologous responses of memory T cells and trained immunity. 6 T cell cross-reactivity is the result of antigens of two different pathogens reacting with the same pool of memory T cells, producing an adaptive immune response. 30 On the other hand there is trained immunity, a term that was coined by Netea et al. in 2011. 31 It refers to the enhanced response of the innate immune system to a secondary infection, after exposure to a primary pathogen. This process has been suggested to be the result of epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. 32,33 These epigenetic changes, mostly through histone modifications, result in an increased ability of these cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines; especially IFN-\u03b3, TNF and IL-1\u03b2. 34 Also of note, is the shift these cells undergo from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, which is thought to impact the induction of trained immunity as well. 35",

Of particular interest to some researchers, is the surprisingly low number of cases and mortality rates in countries who currently have a universal BCG vaccination program. Indeed, a negative association was found between BCG vaccination and mortality rates, which could be explained through heterologous immunity. Of note, several confounders were identified by the authors themselves; under-reporting, SARS-CoV-2 capability testing and differing lockdown measures all could contribute to the apparent lower mortality rate. 3, 4, 5 Methods Countries with at least 1,000 COVID-19 cases and at least 1 million inhabitants were included in the study. To adjust for differences in the epidemic time curve, the number of deaths at the time the country hit the case number 1,000 were also compared. Countries were divided in three main groups; countries with no history of universal BCG vaccination policy, countries with an actual universal vaccination policy and countries with prior BCG vaccination programs that would have resulted in the vaccination of the adult and elderly population.

The population that has been previously shown to benefit from BCG-induced heterologous immunity is restricted to the pediatric population. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [52] [53] Furthermore, this benefit seems to only be apparent when the regions involved already have high childhood mortality, as evidenced by the Danish Calmette Study. 42 The pediatric population can contract COVID-19 and even serve as potential carriers because of their mostly asymptomatic course. 54 Although childhood vaccination seems to have no effect on mortality rates of the adult population, the BCG vaccine could still prove useful. The early genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is helping current efforts in developing a vaccine against it. The use of recombinant technology could help with the early development of a vaccine by using vectors and embedding them with SARS-CoV-2 antigens. 56 As stated before, rBGC vaccines could help in this field as they induce a considerable immune response and have been used before as vectors to nonmycobacterial related antigens. 26-28 Also of interest is the potential effect revaccination might have on the elderly population. The potential of BCG-induced heterologous immunity after revaccination has shown promise, as demonstrated by Warhana et al. 43 Two current clinical trials are looking into this by vaccinating healthcare workers with BCG to see if there is any potential benefit. 57, 58 .

Although great care was taken to try to avoid as many confounders as possible, some still remain. The difference in mortality seems to be higher in the male population than in the female population, which could affect the overall mortality countries with differing demographics. 59 Also, some populations are more genetically susceptible to certain diseases and complications than others (e.g. Latin Americans and diabetes). 60 Some researchers are looking into this by analyzing genetic differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor or the CCL2 and MBL genes, which could affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. 3, 61, 62 Finally, each country's response to the outbreak affects subsequent policies taken by other countries and although the coverage of countries currently using BCG was mostly over 90% no data was available for countries with prior vaccination programs. 50",

Nevertheless, the immunostimulant properties of the BCG vaccine could prove useful in future developments of a vaccine using recombinant technology. Likewise, revaccination with BCG has shown promise in the past for the induction of heterologous immunity.
