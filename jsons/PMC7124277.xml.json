Patients usually present with nonspecific symptoms mimicking pneumonia and respiratory failure. There have been only 2 previous reports of acute lung toxicity related to pomalidomide.2 Because this drug is being increasingly used in multiple myeloma, it is very important to recognize this yet unknown severe adverse reaction in timely manner to avoid significant morbidity in patients. In this article, the authors report an additional case of pomalidomide-induced pulmonary toxicity based on temporal relationship between drug administration and onset of symptoms as well as characteristic imaging findings. This side effect is new and undiscovered, and additional studies are needed to recognize this entity earlier in disease course.",

The patient had been initiated on pomalidomide 8 months before presentation. He had received multiple lines of therapy since the time of diagnosis. Initially, he received bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin, and dexamethasone with good response. Then, he developed disease relapse 10 months later and was started on lenalidomide and dexamethasone. This treatment was complicated by multiple infections. The therapy was placed on hold before resuming it again 6 months later with rise in serum M protein. Three months later, with further rise in M protein, cyclophosphamide was added to the regimen, He achieved partial response and subsequently underwent autologous stem cell transplant with high-dose melphalan conditioning. He remained off therapy for about a year when he was initiated on bortezomib, bendamustine, and dexamethasone with disease relapse; however, he had to be switched to lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone after a brief duration because of minimal response to prior regimen. He responded partially to the latter regimen. Subsequently, dexamethasone was stopped, and lenalidomide and bortezomib maintenance was continued until 8 months before current presentation when he again developed relapse. Lenalidomide and bortezomib were discontinued, and he was initiated on pomalidomide 4 mg/d, days 1 through 21 with dexamethasone 20 mg once weekly.",

The most common presenting symptoms of IMiD pulmonary toxicity are dyspnea, cough, fever, and hypoxia simulating pneumonia. Ground glass opacities are the most common radiologic findings.
