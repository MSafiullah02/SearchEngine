A panel of expert emergency physicians placed highest priority on ED interventions that would alleviate high patient volume, with their greatest concern being ED crowding [4]. Specific interventions included triaging patients to the most appropriate care setting through a website or call center, then standardizing ED admission criteria for patients with respiratory symptoms. This same panel felt disease severity was a lesser issue in the ED setting and more important for inpatient management [4].",

Before presenting to the hospital, patients can be directed to a telemedicine visit for triage. While some portion of these patients will ultimately require hospital-based care, many can be counseled and/or tested in the outpatient setting. Once at the hospital, diverting low-risk patients with respiratory symptoms to an alternate site of care, such as a medical tent, is a strategy to protect ED bed capacity. At George Washington University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, a tent was set up outside the hospital and adjacent to the outpatient clinic building. Patients who arrived to the ED with concern for COVID-19 were directed to the tent and seen by an APP if they met criteria for age, heart rate, and temperature. Patients who did not meet these criteria were deemed higher risk and triaged to a designated ED treatment space (Fig. 1\n).",

However, as demonstrated with COVID-19, early identification can be difficult due to asymptomatic patients and those presenting with atypical symptoms, such as solely gastrointestinal complaints. Without immediate point-of-care tests, it is best to screen individuals through a balanced approach that incorporates clinical features and pertinent epidemiologic clues (including recent travel). This approach allows for the rapid identification of at-risk individuals while limiting the number of individuals who are tested or quarantined unnecessarily [5].

Large health systems may designate one hospital to serve as the primary hospital for infected patients. Within a single ED, there are no clear guidelines on the best organizational model, though it is clear that major adjustments must be made quickly when addressing highly contagious respiratory disease outbreaks. During the SARS outbreak, no decisions were made in the early stages of the outbreak about whether to cohort suspected and/or probable cases of SARS into a centralized section in emergency departments [6]. Thus, it is important to have collateral plans ready to put in place for when such viral outbreaks reoccur. One of the highest priority interventions should be to limit the number of staff and patients exposed by geographically cohorting patients with presumed or confirmed infection [4]. This operational approach must be implemented in the early stages of an outbreak as the efficacy declines significantly once an infection becomes widespread.",

In this model, providers and nurses are assigned specific rooms and automatically assigned patients who arrive in these rooms. When cohorting patients, the care team would be assigned solely to the rooms in that cohort, thus limiting interaction with outside patients and staff. The providers and nurses may sit together at a workstation near the assigned room (Fig. 2\n) [7]. In terms of staffing these cohorts, it is most appropriate to use long shifts and overtime hours to limit the amount of staff turnover. Additionally, if possible, use staff who are immune (recovered) in these units and negative pressure rooms for these patients [8]. This operational plan must be flexible to change based on input from staff and the evolution of an individual outbreak situation. It is important to reinforce that cohorting is most effective in the early stages of an outbreak; there may come a point, depending on the level of contagion, where there are too many patients under investigation or confirmed positive patients in the ED and on the inpatient floors to cohort them.",

            "text": "Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable to transmission of respiratory infections due to close proximity and department crowding, as highlighted during the 2003 SARS outbreak [9]. Currently, early data from Wuhan and Italy suggest a very high COVID-19 disease burden among healthcare providers [10]. Thus an important aspect of infection control is limiting patient-to-provider spread and provider-to-patient spread. A case-control study in five Hong Kong hospitals found that consistent practice of droplet and contact precaution significantly reduced the risk of infection in healthcare workers after exposures to patients with SARS [11]. Another study found that inadequate supply, and inconsistent use, of personal protection equipment (PPE) when in contact with SARS patients were independent risk factors for SARS infection [12]. A case-control study of 254 hospital staff with documented exposure to SARS patients found that consistent droplet and contact precaution was adequate to significantly reduce the number of infections from patient exposures [11]. PPE can be a highly controversial subject with conflicting recommendations from different sources. Current COVID-19 guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the CDC recommend that any healthcare provider (HCP) performing an aerosol-generating procedure on a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient (including endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, NIPPV, and administration of nebulized treatment) wear fitted respirator masks, like N95 or FFP2, along with contact precaution and eye protection [10] [13]. In order to best preserve respirator masks for high-risk procedures, providers working with non-ventilated patients are recommended to wear surgical/medical masks. ED leadership should plan for, and obtain, an appropriate supply of PPE and establish allocation procedures. For instance, in case of shortage, each staff member may be given one N95 respirator per shift that is \u2018checked out\u2019 rather than leaving boxes out in the open, with potential for anxious staff to use or take-home extra.",

Most importantly, metered-dose inhalers pose a smaller risk of infectious spread via respiratory droplet than nebulizers and are the preferred mode of delivery. As discussed above, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign classifies nebulized treatments as an aerosol-generating procedure that requires the administrating healthcare provider to wear fitted respirator masks like N95 or FFP2 [10]. Nebulizers generate aerosol particles 1\u20135 \u03bcm in size, with N95 respirators protecting against particles 0.3 \u03bcm or larger. These treatments pose the risk of generating a high volume of small particles and propelling them over a longer distance than the natural air dispersion pattern [14]. This is supported by evidence from the SARS outbreak, where a super-spreading event was largely related to the use of salbutamol via jet nebulizer [15]. Though limited, existing evidence suggests that MDIs, when used correctly, are as effective as nebulized treatments [16]. Thus, EDs will need to increase stock of inhalers and spacers, in addition to instructing staff to preferentially order inhaler treatments. EMS personnel need to be included in this discussion, such that no patient should arrive in a stretcher with a nebulizer actively aerosolizing particles.",

Diagnostic imaging facilities should be prepared with guidelines to handle such an event. This includes using portable radiographic equipment whenever possible, which limits patient transport and can be easily cleaned afterwards [17]. The American College of Radiology has recommended against the use of CT as a first-line screening tool for viral respiratory infections, like COVID-19. CT should be reserved for patients with clinical indications that require CT and appropriate infection control measures should be in place before scanning subsequent patients [17]. According to the CDC and Spaulding Criteria, these equipment pieces are only in contact with intact skin and are therefore considered \u201cnoncritical items\u201d. They can be cleaned via low-level disinfectants, which include isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol, with single-use disposable disinfectant towels [18]. The use of satellite radiography centers and/or dedicated radiographic equipment can also decrease the risk of transmission. Additionally, if it is required that a patient be transported to the radiology department, it is essential that individual be wearing appropriate PPE throughout transport.",

Looking at the current COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of several to critical hypoxic respiratory failure is 19% [19]. Current guidelines recommend the use of high-flow nasal cannula over non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for COVID-19 patients; this is due to the high failure rate and increased risk of intubation associated with NIPPV use in patients with non-cardiogenic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [10]. High flow oxygen is also thought to be lower risk for aerosolization than NIPPV.",

One consideration for limiting exposure to aerosolized pathogens is to use video-guided laryngoscopy over direct laryngoscopy as evidence suggests this may reduce the number of failed intubation attempts [20]. COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation should be managed similarly to other patients with acute respiratory failure, with special attention to settings that limit ventilator-induced lung injury as ARDS is the cause of death in many patients. A stock of disposable tape measurers for patient height and a wall reference with ideal body weights may help hard-wire appropriate initial settings.",
