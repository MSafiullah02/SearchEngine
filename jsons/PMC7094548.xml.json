Alternatively, the investigation of gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that are easily obtained, offer the possibility of longitudinal follow-up, ensure excellent RNA quality and show a considerable degree of heritability and stability in gene expression levels (Meaburn et al., 2009) is a more feasible approach. Indeed, brain expressed genes are expressed in PBMCs and some show co-expression or similar expression levels in the same individuals, supporting their use as a surrogate tissue for gene expression profiling in schizophrenia (Bowden et al., 2006; Gladkevich et al., 2004; Liew et al., 2006; Rollins et al., 2010; Sullivan et al., 2006). In this regard, other groups have sought to identify blood-based expression profiles or develop panels of genes in small cohorts which may be useful for identifying functionally significant genetic and epigenetic changes in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls or even other related psychiatric disorders (Kurian et al., 2009; Maschietto et al., 2012; Middleton et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2010; Tsuang et al., 2005).",

These cells have been shown to express a number of brain associated proteins including receptors for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glucocorticoids, catecholamines, serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine, and conversely many neurons express receptors for signaling molecules of the immune system (e.g. cytokines) (Guyon et al., 2008; Kronfol and Remick, 2000; McKenna et al., 2002; Muller and Ackenheil, 1998). That there may be an immunological link to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is not a new concept. Linkage and GWAS support an association of a broad section of markers in the major histocompatability complex (MHC) region at 6p21.33 with schizophrenia (Consortium, 2008; Lewis et al., 2003; Li et al., 2010; O'Donovan et al., 2008; Ripke et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2009; Stefansson et al., 2009) and other reports suggest this locus is biologically relevant to schizophrenia (Laumbacher et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2008; Straub et al., 2002). Immune-associated genes, genetic variants and haplotypes are also implicated in schizophrenia (Lencz et al., 2007; Ozbey et al., 2009; Paul-Samojedny et al., 2011). A recent study combining Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and hypergeometric analysis of GWAS data showed pathways relating to apoptosis, inflammation or immunity were over-represented in schizophrenia (Jia et al., 2010).",

Moreover, signs of inflammation and activation or increased densities of microglia have been observed in post-mortem brains and CSF from patients with schizophrenia (Doorduin et al., 2009; Drexhage et al., 2010; Monji et al., 2011; van Berckel et al., 2008). A wealth of evidence suggests diverse environmental risk factors impacting on immune function may play a role in schizophrenia including maternal infection and birth in the peak infection seasons of Winter/Spring (Brown and Derkits, 2010; Byrne et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2006; Zuckerman and Weiner, 2005), maternal and neonatal deficiency in vitamin D which is critical for immunocompetency (McGrath et al., 2010; Schwalfenberg, 2011), malnutrition and psychological stress (reviewed in Markham and Koenig, 2011). Indeed, rodent models of maternal immune challenge results in schizophrenia-associated behavioral changes and cognitive deficits (Nawa and Takei, 2006; Shi et al., 2003).",

To further develop gene expression signatures that characterize the molecular background in individuals with schizophrenia we conducted gene or mRNA expression profiling in the largest PBMC cohort to date using the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). The ASRB is a well characterized cohort of participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and carefully screened non-psychiatric controls (Loughland et al., 2010).

In this study, the cohort consisted of 114 participants with a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (cases) as diagnosed by the World Health Organization's ICD-10 criteria and 80 non-psychiatric controls. Demographic and clinical variables of the cohort are summarized in Table 1\nand detailed in Supplementary Table 1. There was a significant difference in the mean age of cases and controls (mean age cases 42.3 years, controls 38.7 years, 2-tailed t test p = 0.0498) that is of a small magnitude. Similarly, there was a difference in mean age between schizophrenia and schizoaffective cases (mean age schizophrenia 41 years, mean age schizoaffective disorder 46 years, 2-tailed t test p = 0.03). This small difference in age in mature adults was considered to be unlikely to have significantly impacted upon gene expression. There was a significant difference in gender distribution of cases and controls with more males in the patient group compared to the controls (60% male cases, 42% male controls, 2-tailed Pearson Chi-square p = 0.013) although this is similar to the gender distribution in population samples.

Both MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) and EIF2C2 (or argonaute 2; AGO2) (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C, 2) are implicated in miRNA biogenesis which we have previously shown to be altered in post-mortem brain (Beveridge et al., 2010) as well as in PBMCs (Gardiner et al., 2011). In addition, MEF2D was altered in neuroblast culture in response to retinoic acid-induced differentiation suggesting it may be involved in neuronal differentiation, a process that is biologically relevant to schizophrenia. Several genes were also chosen for their involvement in immune function: EVL (Enah/Vasp-like), DEFA4 (defensin \u03b14), PI3 (peptidase inhibitor 3, skin-derived), S100A12 (S100 calcium binding protein A12), CCR7 (Chemokine (C\u2013C motif) receptor 7), CD6 molecule and HMHA1 (histocompatibility (minor) HA-1). VAMP5 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 5 (myobrevin)) was chosen, as it was one of the most strongly up-regulated genes. Primers were designed in Oligo Explorer V1.5 (Gene Link, NY, USA) (primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 3). Relative mRNA expression was calculated as the ratio of the gene and the geometric mean of the most stable and efficient housekeeping genes hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S). Outliers (expression >3 standard deviations from the mean) were excluded from further analysis. Statistical significance of differential mRNA expression between schizophrenia and control groups was determined by Student's t-test (one-tailed p < 0.05).",

Ten genes were chosen for Q-PCR validation based on strong differential expression on the array and/or biological significance. Six genes were confirmed to have significant alterations in expression in the cases; myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C, 2 (EIF2C2; or argonaute 2 (AGO2)) and Enah/Vasp-like (EVL) were down-regulated and defensin \u03b14 (DEFA4), peptidase inhibitor 3, skin-derived (PI3) and S100 calcium binding protein A12 (S100A12) were up-regulated, validating the results of the microarray (Fig. 2\nand Table 3\n). Validation of four additional genes was conducted. Chemokine (C\u2013C motif) receptor 7 (CCR7; p = 0.054) and CD6 molecule (p = 0.053), showed a strong trend toward down-regulation in the cases, whilst histocompatibility (minor) HA-1 (HMHA1; p = 0.089) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 5 (myobrevin) (VAMP5; p = 0.101) showed general trends toward down and up-regulation respectively (Fig. 2A and B), all of which were consistent with the microarray analysis. The fold changes detected by the microarray and Q-PCR were significantly correlated (Pearson r = 0.976, p < 0.0001, data not shown) and in all but one instance, fold changes detected by Q-PCR were of greater magnitude compared to those detected on the microarray.",

            "text": "Interestingly, when we considered up-regulated genes in this enriched group separately, the innate immune response in particular was featured. For example, Secretory Leukocyte Peptidase Inhibitor (SLPI) and Azurocidin 1 (AZU1) are chemotactic for cells of the innate immune system and modulate the inflammatory response (Sallenave, 2002; Soehnlein et al., 2008; Subramaniyam et al., 2011). Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is up-regulated during inflammation and in the plasma of patients with mild cognitive impairment (Choi et al., 2011), and is induced by IL-1\u03b2, a protein elevated in the CSF of first episode schizophrenia patients (Cowland et al., 2003; Soderlund et al., 2009). Chemokine-like factor (CKLF), has roles in dendritic cell maturation (Han et al., 2001; Ke et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2010) and is chemotactic for immune cells and possibly has roles in brain development (Han et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2010). Two \u03b1-defensin family members, DEFA4 (Q-PCR validated) and DEFA1\u03b2 were up-regulated, consistent with increased \u03b1-defensin protein levels in T cell lysates from treated and antipsychotic free schizophrenia patients (Craddock et al., 2008). Defensins (endogenous peptide antibiotics) are abundant in neutrophil granules, natural killer cells and T lymphocyte subsets and act as immunomodulatory factors regulating acute inflammation, phagocytosis, cell migration/maturation and cytokine secretion (Klotman and Chang, 2006; Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2007; Selsted and Ouellette, 2005). DEFA4 inhibits synthesis of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids known to have significant influence on developing synaptic structure and function in the adult brain (Owen et al., 2005). Many \u03b1-defensin genes cluster at 8p23, near a schizophrenia linkage site (Fallin et al., 2011; Suarez et al., 2006) known to be a hot spot for copy number variation (CNV) in normal individuals (Aldred et al., 2005).",

(2005) identified several down-regulated genes from the MHC region in PBMCs and we identified changes to ABCF1, LEMD2, TJAP1, ITPR3 and HIST1H2BK that reside at or near this locus. Interestingly, the major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1 (HLA-DRB1) was also down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex (Glatt et al., 2005). Three genes up-regulated in our study and in Glatt's study include the Galectin family member lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble 3 (LGALS3), a negative regulator of T lymphocyte activation (Yang et al., 2008); the antiprotease, antibacterial and possibly anti-inflammatory Peptidase inhibitor 3, skin-derived (PI3) (Sallenave, 2002) and the pro-inflammatory S100 calcium binding protein A12, calgranulin C (S100A12) (Glatt et al., 2005). S100A12 was also up-regulated in leukocytes obtained from discordant schizophrenic sibling pairs with known linkage to 5q (Middleton et al., 2005). Related S100 genes (S1200A1 and S100A6) were also up-regulated in our post-mortem study of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in schizophrenia (Bowden et al., 2008) and S100A9 was up-regulated in whole blood from schizophrenia patients (Tsuang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The immune-associated mRNA expression signature also agrees with genes predicted to be targeted by a cluster of differentially expressed miRNA identified in an overlapping cohort to this study at chr14q32 that have roles in a range of immune-related pathways such as \u2018T Cell Receptor Signaling\u2019, \u2018Chemokine Signaling\u2019, \u2018Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity\u2019 and \u2018Cytokine\u2013Cytokine Receptor Interaction\u2019 (Gardiner et al., 2011). Down-regulation of EVL is interesting since it is a host gene for miR-342 (Grady et al., 2008), a member of the down-regulated 14q32 miRNA cluster. EVL is involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton which is essential for processes in the CNS (such as axon guidance) and in the immune system (interaction between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, phagocytosis and chemotaxis of immune cells) (Krause et al., 2003). Down-regulation of EIF2C2 (encoding the endonuclease argonaute 2; AGO2) which functions in small non-coding RNA mediated gene silencing (Cenik and Zamore, 2011) is interesting considering that members of the 14q32 miRNA cluster down-regulated in the cases in this cohort (Gardiner et al., 2011) were over-represented among miRNA that were down-regulated in dopaminergic neurons from the striatum of Ago2-deficient mice (Schaefer et al., 2010). Members of this cluster also contain structural features associated with dicer-independent/Ago2-slicer activity-dependent processing (Diederichs and Haber, 2007; Frank et al., 2010; O'Carroll et al., 2007). This suggests that EIF2C2 is especially important for 14q32 cluster biogenesis and may be related to their down-regulation in PBMCs in these cases (Gardiner et al., 2011) and supports our previous observations of altered miRNA biogenesis in schizophrenia in the cortex (Beveridge et al., 2010). Similarly, down-regulation of MEF2D, a calcium-activated transcription factor, may also provide a mechanism driving the schizophrenia-associated down-regulation of the 14q32 miRNA cluster observed in this cohort since this transcription factor was shown to be a positive regulator of some of these miRNA in rat neurons (Fiore et al., 2009). Moreover, MEF2s have been shown to regulate immune cells (Aude-Garcia et al., 2010; Potthoff and Olson, 2007) and MEF2D has important roles in the brain in neuro-development, neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (Heidenreich and Linseman, 2004; Lam and Chawla, 2007; She et al., 2011). In addition, we have previously reported up-regulation of MEF2D in response to retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation (Beveridge et al., 2009). The distinct roles this transcription factor has in immune function and in the brain makes it an attractive candidate for future investigation.",

            "text": "Despite these connections, the biological significance of altered expression of genes associated with immune function in schizophrenia is unknown. Therefore it is difficult to determine whether the immune-related expression signature reflects abnormality central and specific to the underlying pathogenesis of schizophrenia or is an indirect consequence of its pathophysiology or co-morbid environmental factor(s). The immune-related signature could reflect the state of illness. Narayan et al. (2008) report that differentially expressed genes in post mortem brain from schizophrenia subjects are involved in inflammation, stimulus-response and immune-related pathways and were more strongly associated with long-term chronic schizophrenia (Narayan et al., 2008). The immune-related expression signature in our cohort, perhaps more representative of chronic schizophrenia is consistent with this observation. The molecular basis of the disorder may change with duration of illness and therefore whether these immune signatures are persistent through exacerbation and remission requires longitudinal studies. Additionally, whether these changes can be detected at the onset of illness could be assessed using first-episode psychosis cohorts. Another possibility is that medications are contributing toward the immune-associated gene expression signature. Indeed, a number of antipsychotics and antidepressants have been shown to display immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects (Chen et al., 2012; Drzyzga et al., 2006; Schmitt et al., 2005; Tynan et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the influence of antipsychotic medication on gene expression could not be determined due to the nature of this information being self-reported by the participants with schizophrenia rather than through medical records. Similarly, obesity could also foster a pro-inflammatory state and may be affecting gene expression. However, since measures of current weight status e.g. body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference were not available, this possibility could not be further investigated.",
