It can lead to serious economic losses in poultry enterprises. The use of live attenuated vaccines against IB has produced very good results. However, the attenuated vaccine can cause latent infection, and may become a source of mutation and restructuring of the virus because of the high degree of variability of IBV, the frequency of deletion and insertion mutations of the RNA genome, as well as homologous recombination between different strains (including the vaccine strains). Another potential problem with attenuated vaccines is reversion to virulence in the course of use.",

They are widely used in the construction of vaccines using genetic engineering [6]. For example, chicken interferon type II (also known as interferon \u03b3, ChIFN\u03b3) is synthesized and secreted by T cells that have been activated by antigen or mitogen. It is an important immune regulator and has strong adjuvant effects, such as the promotion of expression of MHC II antigen, stimulation of reciprocity of T cells and antigen-presenting cells, and enhancement of the role of T cells in the auxiliary production of antibody. It also has the ability to regulate immune and other activity of cytotoxic T cells. Interferons have been described as an adjuvant [7]. In addition, interferons are of great significance for alleviation of the residual toxicity and side effects of the fowlpox virus vector, so that weight gain is not affected after vaccination with recombinant fowlpox virus [8]. We inserted the gene for ChIFN\u03b3 into a fowlpox virus vector and constructed a recombinant fowlpox virus that expressed IBV S1 gene and chicken interferon-\u03b3 gene.",

The S1 gene of rFPV-IFN\u03b3S1 is derived from IBV strain LX4, so rFPV-IFN\u03b3S1 can provide protection against IBV strain LX4. The IBV strains used in this study belong to gene cluster I (strains LX4 and LHLJ04XI), gene cluster II (strain LHB), gene cluster III (strain LSC99I) and gene cluster IV (strain LTJ95I). Although all of these strains cause renal disease, their source varies and there are differences in the S1 gene. The results of this study would have theoretical and practical significance for the application of the recombinant vaccine rFPV-IFN\u03b3S1 in protection against heterogeneous strains of IBV.",

It also plays an important role in the serologic classification of the virus. In recent years, S1 gene has become established as the major gene for recombinant vaccine research against IBV infection. In this study, a recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV-IFN\u03b3S1) that co-expressed the IBV S1 gene and the chicken interferon-\u03b3 gene was used to vaccinate SPF chickens. The results showed that the recombinant virus protected immunized chickens against challenge with IBV strains LHLJ04XI and LHB, which are closely related to IBV strain LX4. The rates of protection were 72.72% (8/11) and 70% (7/10), which were not significantly different from 75% of IBV strain LX4 (9/12) [5]. However, the rates of protection conferred by the vaccine against IBV strains LSC99I and LTJ95I were only 50% (5/10) and 54.55% (6/11), respectively, and were significantly different (p\n < 0.05) from that of IBV strain LX4. Therefore, the recombinant vaccine protected chickens challenged with strains that were closely related genetically to the vaccine strain. These results above demonstrated that the recombinant fowlpox virus co-expressing the chicken IFN-\u03b3 gene and IBV S1 gene induced strong and reliable immunoprotection, and reduced the growth inhibitory effect of the avian pox virus vector.",

Therefore, FPV has been developed as a non-replicating vector for vaccination of mammals [22], [23]. More sophisticated vaccination strategies have included the expression of multiple distinct antigens. Previous studies have successfully constructed a recombinant FPV virus that co-expressed three foreign genes (from two different avian pathogens) [24] and a foreign reporter gene at a single non-essential gene site. Although this recombinant gave rise to few side effects, it still showed slight inhibition of weight gain. Researchers have explored different means to reduce the side effects of recombinant fowlpox virus, one of which is to introduce immune regulatory cytokines to the recombinant vaccine. Interferon is an important cytokine, and chicken IFN-\u03b3 is an immune regulator that is secreted by antigen or mitogen-activated T lymphocytes. It not only has immunomodulatory activity but also acts to promote increased body weight and to reduce the effects of stress [25], [26]. There were no significant differences in the body weights between the vaccinated and the control groups in this study, indicating that co-expression of the chicken IFN-\u03b3 gene with IBV S1 gene played a role in immune regulation, and reduced the side effects associated with the fowlpox virus vector.",

In this study, the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes increased in the vaccinated groups, and the level was higher than that in the control groups; the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes continued to rise after challenge.

In order to study the mechanism of immune protection, they transplanted T cells into chickens after removal of the CD4+ or CD8+ cells. The T cells were stimulated by IBV, and the chickens were challenged with IBV strain. The results showed that after the removal of CD4+ cells chickens could be protected against challenge with IBV strain G; virus loads in the lung and kidney were reduced. However, chickens in the group with depletion of CD8+ cells and also the control groups were not provided with the same protection; virus could be re-isolated from lung and kidney tissue. These findings confirmed the protective role of CD8+ cells in acute IBV infection. In this study, the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the groups vaccinated with the recombinant vaccine was significantly higher than that in the control groups, indicating that cellular immunity was induced. After challenge, the level of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the vaccinated groups challenged with IBV strains LHLJ04XI and LHB was significantly higher than those in the groups challenged with IBV strains LSC99I and LTJ95I. This may be because the recombinant vaccine could not protect against infection with distantly related viruses, leading to serious damage to immune cells, which is consistent with the previous findings [27]. Pathological damage in the immunized groups challenged with IBV strains LX4, LHLJ04XI and LHB was significantly less severe than that in the control group and the groups challenged with IBV strains LSC99I and LTJ95I, again indicating that the recombinant vaccine in this study provided good protection against closely related challenge viruses.",

The analysis of the amino acid sequence of the S1 protein in the different serotypes and strains, and the cross-protection results produced by vaccines of different strains show that there is no correspondence between IBV serotypes and a variety of clinical phenotypes [28]. Ignjatovic and Galli reported that the conventional attenuated vaccines were able to provide effective protection against the different serotypes of IBV [19]. There is cross-protection between some kidney-type strains of the virus and certain respiratory virus strains. However, some respiratory viruses may not exert a cross-protective effect, or may show a poor cross-protective effect. This may be caused by the different origins of the strains or differences in the genes encoding major protective antigens. Of the five IBV strains selected for the experimental challenge in this study, strain LX4 was a reference strain and the other four strains were isolated in different regions in China. They were all the kidney-selective pathogenic type, but from the perspective of genetics, the four strains had very different relationships with the reference strain LX4, which led to the different cross-protective effects. The results in this study show that the recombinant vaccine protected immunized chickens from challenge with IBV strains LHLJ04XI and LHB and there were no significant differences in morbidity and mortality when immunized chickens were challenged either with these IBVs or with the reference strain LX4 whereas the protection conferred by rFPV-IFN\u03b3S1 was incomplete in chickens challenged with IBV strains LSC99I and LTJ95I, indicating that the recombinant vaccine incorporating the IBV S1 gene and the chicken interferon-\u03b3 gene provided effective immune protection against challenge with heterogeneous IBV strains that have closer phylogenetic relationship in S1 gene.",
