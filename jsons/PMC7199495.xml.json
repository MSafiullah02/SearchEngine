Influenza A virus RNA was detected only in the CSF sample of 1 patient, despite testing the CSF samples with a highly sensitive influenza A virus\u2013specific PCR assay [14]. Accordingly, influenza virus could rarely be detected in CSF samples obtained from patients who had influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis in the past [4, 5, 19]. It cannot be entirely discounted that, in the present cases, lumbar puncture was performed too late for the detection of influenza A virus in the CSF. However, this seems unlikely, because all CSF samples were obtained during the course of encephalopathy, and 75% of the samples were obtained \u2a7d3 days after the onset of neurological symptoms.",

Although the integrity of the blood-brain barrier was not evaluated in previous studies [5, 8], it has been suggested that direct invasion by influenza A virus and inflammation is unlikely to be the cause of encephalopathy [5]. Moreover, histological abnormalities of the brain are often absent in patients who die with clinical signs of influenza-associated encephalopathy [20], and despite the occurrence of massive brain edema, no influenza antigen has been detected in the brains of patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy [5]. All of these observations indicate that the integrity of the blood-brain barrier may be an important factor for the detectability of influenza A virus RNA in CSF specimens.",

Additional observations further point to a metabolic cause of the influenzal encephalopathies observed: the most prominent neurological disorders were disorientation and altered consciousness; the duration of hospitalization was short for these patients, compared with patients who had postinfluenzal encephalopathy; and patients did not experience neurological sequelae. These findings are in concordance with previous studies of influenza-associated encephalopathy that found liver function abnormalities [5, 8, 20, 23]. Thus, metabolic encephalopathies may be more common in patients with influenza A virus infection than has previously been acknowledged as a result of their wide variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from deep coma to subtle abnormalities detectable only by psychometric testing [24]. Therefore, annual influenza vaccination and early recognition of influenza virus infection by rapid and sensitive assays seems all the more important, especially in patients who have preexisting chronic liver or kidney disease.",
