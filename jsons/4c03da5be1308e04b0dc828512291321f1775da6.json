[42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] The use of intra-nasal mupirocin has been examined in a large multicentre trial which showed that the use of intra-nasal mupirocin in PD patients with confirmed nasal S. aureus carriage decreased exit-site infection but not peritonitis. 48 However, there is little data regarding the comparative efficacy between the intranasal versus exit-site application of mupirocin. While the use of mupirocin prophylaxis has resulted in reduced S. aureus infection in PD patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains a significant issue for exit-site infections. A multicentre doubleblind randomized trial compared the use of daily gentamicin ointment versus daily mupirocin ointment as exit-site prophylaxis. The results demonstrated that gentamicin ointment had similar efficacy for preventing S. aureus exit-site infection as mupirocin but with an added value of preventing Pseudomonas exit-site infections. Other emerging prophylactic therapies for PD exit site include the use of MediHoney and Polysporin triple (Bacitracin, gramicidin and polymixin B) ointment.

Immunization programs should be in place to ensure that patients with kidney diseases are vaccinated early in the course of progressive renal impairment to maximize the chance of achieving protective immunity. Comments HBV -Compared with immunocompetent adults, in whom adequate anti-HBs response occurs in over 95% after HBV vaccination, the immunization efficacy is reduced (median 60-70%) in dialysis patients and immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients. Patients should be vaccinated according to the standard intramuscular schedule over 6 months, and the dose should be doubled in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications, and kidney transplant recipients. In patients who are scheduled to undergo kidney transplantation within 6 months, an accelerated vaccination schedule with three to four doses of vaccine given monthly can be considered. In non-immune kidney transplant recipients, delaying HBV vaccination for 6-12 months after the transplant operation may increase the immunization efficacy. HBV infection has been observed in dialysis patients with prior anti-HBs response after vaccination but whose prevailing anti-HBs level was below 10 IU/L. Therefore, booster dose of HBV vaccine is recommended for patients with prior anti-HBs but whose anti-HBs level has fallen to 10 IU/L or below. Subjects who have not responded to one course of HBV vaccination should be given another course of vaccine, and if it still fails to induce anti-HBs additional dose of vaccine is not warranted.

HBV infection confers adverse outcomes in KTR due to acute hepatic complications such as fulminant hepatitis/fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis or chronic complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 65, 66 Careful matching of the donor/recipient HBV status is an important step to prevent HBV transmission during renal transplantation. Chronic HBV infection in the recipient is not a contraindication of kidney transplantation. In HBsAg-positive transplant candidates, the HBeAg and HBV DNA levels should also be evaluated as HBeAg positivity and high HBV DNA levels are associated with increased risk of HBV reactivation after renal transplantation. 67 Renal transplantation when both donor and recipient are both HBsAg-positive is also possible, especially in localities with high prevalence of HBV carrier and organ shortage. The use of the HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive donor is slightly more complex. The risk of transmission to kidney recipients appears to be low though has been reported. 68, 69 Such risk can be further reduced by pretransplant HBV vaccination, use of HBV immunoglobulin (HBIG) and/or in combination of oral nucleostide/tide analogues. [70] [71] [72] HBV vaccination is an effective means to prevent HBV transmission and hence should be administered to dialysis patients who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs negative. The efficacy of HBV vaccine might be reduced in renal failure and higher dose of vaccine is advocated. 73 Intradermal HBV vaccine can be considered in patients who fail to mount protective antibodies (i.e. anti-HBs) after standard HBV immunization. 74 The risk of transmission of HCV infection associated with organ transplantation from an HCV-positive donor is high, and HCV-negative recipients who received an HCV-positive kidney had significantly adverse outcomes. 75, 76 These data suggested a HCV-positive kidney should not be transplanted to a HCV-negative recipient. It remains optimistic that advances in donor/recipient matching with respective to genotypes and the use of novel anti-HCV treatments may further improve the safety of these HCV-positive renal transplants in the future.",

Mounting evidence has suggested that such renal transplantation in carefully selected patients can be associated with acceptable clinical outcomes. A prospective study have examined the outcomes of renal transplantation in 150 HIV-positive recipients who had CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 200/cm 3 and undetectable HIV RNA. 77 The CMV and VZV serological status of donor and recipient will help determine the risk of post-transplant infection and hence guide clinician decisions for prophylaxis. The prophylactic strategies for CMV and VZV will be discussed in subsequent sections. EBV is highly associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) . 78 Transmission of syphilis by renal transplantation and has been reported and syphilis infection can have severe clinical manifestation in renal transplant recipients. 79 Nevertheless, syphilis is not a contraindication of renal transplantation if each recipient receives an appropriate course of post-transplant penicillin. 79 Tuberculosis is endemic infection in the Asia-Pacific region. TB infection in KTR is associated with substantial mortality (~20-30%) and the majority of cases are due to reactivation of old infective foci. 80, 81 Chest radiography should be performed in all recipients to exclude latent or old TB, especially in localities where TB is endemic. 82 The detection of these radiological abnormalities will prompt clinicians to use isoniazid prophylaxis. 83 Limitations Donors with high risk of HIV or HCV might have false-negative results during the window period and more sensitive tests such nucleic acid-based assays might be warranted. These sensitive tests, however, might give rise to false positive results and hence limit organ availability. VDRL can also give rise to false-negative and false-negative results, and more accurate tests might lead to resource implications and slower turn-around time. Limitation of using skin tuberculin tests to screen latent TB include: (i) most Hong Kong people have previous bacillus calmette-gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and hence skin tuberculin tests are often false-positive; (ii) impaired immunological response dialysis patients can give rise to false-negative skin tuberculin test results. There is also limited local experience regarding renal transplantation in HIV-positive recipients.",

Viral culture show high specificity for diagnosis of CMV infection. However, its application is limited by its modest sensitivity and slow turn-around time which rendered this test unfavourable for guiding treatment decisions. 92 The prophylactic approach refers to the prescription of anti-viral agent to all 'at-risk' patients for a defined period after solid organ transplantation, and regardless of the CMVpp65 antigen or CMV PCR results. Oral valganciclovir, oral or IV ganciclovir and oral valacyclovir are all effective prophylaxis for CMV infection. [94] [95] [96] [97] While all three agents have shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials, valganciclovir is the preferred prophylaxis for CMV infection. In one randomized controlled trial which compared valganciclovir and ganciclovir, both drugs have demonstrated similar efficacy in preventing CMV disease (17.2 vs 18.4%) .94 In this context, valganciclovir has the advantage of good bioavailability and lower pill burden. The clinical benefit of valganciclovir was further supported by another prospective randomized trial which included 318 CMV D+R\u2212 kidney transplant recipients. This study compared the different treatment duration of valganciclovir (100 vs 200 days), and concluded that the latter was associated with significantly lower incidence of CMV disease (36.8 vs 16.1%) . 98 Based on these results, the prophylactic approach is preferred in KTR who are D+R\u2212 and a 200-day course of valganciclovir appeared to be the optimal prophylaxis. Compared with the pre-emptive approach, the efficacy of the prophylactic approach was supported by more large randomized trials and was associated with clinical benefits on graft outcomes, mortality and other opportunistic infections. 99 However, the prophylactic approach was also associated with higher treatment costs and increased risk of myelosuppression and late-onset CMV disease. The pre-emptive approach refers to regular monitoring of viral replication and initiation of anti-viral treatment when a certain virological threshold is reached. The prerequisite of pre-emptive include good coordination of patients for regular monitoring and fast turn-around time of laboratory tests. Oral valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir are both effective agents for pre-emptive treatment in asymptomatic CMV reactivation. 100, 101 Other merits of the pre-emptive approach include lower drug costs and potentially less treatment toxicity with shorter duration of anti-viral therapy.",

In some renal units, acyclovir is already used for CMV prophylaxis after kidney transplantation and this also offer some protective effects against VZV and other herpes viruses. Short-term prophylaxis with acyclovir can be given to HSV-positive KTR who are not receiving CMV prophylaxis during the early post-transplant period. 113 There is inadequate data to suggest routine longterm administration of VZV prophylaxis in KTR . 113 There is also no guidelines regarding VZV prophylaxis after recent intensification of immunosuppressive treatments (e.g. for allograft rejection). VZV vaccine, being a live vaccine, poses a risk of disseminated infection in KTR and thus is contraindicated in KTR . 113 Seronegative KTR are vulnerable to severe primary infection and hence should receive post-exposure prophylaxis after significant exposure to VZV. Options for postexposure prophylaxis include passive immunization and/or anti-viral agents. While varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) is not available in many centres, IVIG appear to be a reasonable alternative as post-exposure prophylaxis. 113, 114 The efficacy of anti-viral agents, when used as adjunct to VZIG, has been demonstrated in immunocompetent children and in a small study of high-risk children (five being KTR) .

The strategies for screening and decolonization of MRSA will be elaborated in section F5. 42 Intravenous vancomycin (at a dose of 1 g every 5-7 days for total of at least 2 weeks) is a recommended treatment of MRSA exit-site or tunnel tract infection in PD patients. 42 Intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin has been used with success for the treatment of MRSA peritonitis in PD patients. The ISPD guidelines recommended that IP vancomycin be administered for the treatment of PD-related peritonitis due to MRSA. 42 Vancomycin is also effective treatment for HDcatheter related infections including exit-site and CRBI . 131 Other options of MRSA treatment in dialysis patients include teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Teicoplanin has the advantage of longer half-life and better tolerability than vancomycin. Daptomycin has been approved for the treatment of complicated MRSA skin infections and bacteremia (with or without endocarditis) in a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day. 132 The dosage should remain the same but the frequency should be reduced to every 48 h in stage 4 or 5 CKD patients. 133 Linezolid (at a dosage of 600 mg twice daily, IV or PO) has been approved for the treatment of MRSA skin infection as well as community-or hospital-acquired MRSA pneumonia. 134 No dosage modification is required for linezolid in dialysis patients but side effects such as thrombocytopenia and lactic acidosis need to be closely monitored. 134 Tigecycline shows good in vitro activity against the majority of MRSA strains and is an approved treatment for MRSA skin and intraabdominal infections. 135, 136 One advantage of tigecycline in CKD and dialysis patients is that it does not require dosage adjustment and has little concern regarding its timing of administration in relation to HD due to its poor dialyzability. There is lack of clinical data regarding the use of IP tigecycline for MRSA peritonitis although previous pharmacokinetics studies have demonstrated the stability of tigecycline in different concentrations of PD fluid. 137 Quinupristindalfopristin is approved for MRSA skin infections with no dosage adjustment in renal failure subjects but its data in dialysis patients is relatively limited. 133 Other novel treatments for MRSA infections include lipoglycopeptides dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin as well as newer generation cephalosporins such as ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. 135, 138, 139 The data on these emerging therapies for MRSA, however, is still lacking among renal failure patients and further studies are required to demonstrate their efficacy in such clinical context. Furthermore, some of these agents are still not available in many local centres and hence limiting their clinical utility.",

Rationale A treatment regimen for MDR-TB consists of multiple second-line anti-TB agents which usually includes fluoroquinolones and injectable aminoglycosides. 188 One should be cautious in administering these agents in CKD patients and dialysis patients who still have considerable residual renal function. Other second-line agents include linezolid, ethionamide, cycloserine. 189, 190 The infection precautions of MDR-TB are similar to that of drug-susceptible TB. The infectivity of a MDR-TB patient should be weighed with regarding to their clinical status and sputum smear results. 191 A patient is considered infectious if: (i) they are undergoing cough-inducing procedures; (ii) they have positive sputum smear results for acid fast bacilli; (iii) they have cavitary lesions evident on chest radiography; (iv) they are not receiving adequate anti-TB treatment or show poor clinical response to therapy. Airborne precautions should be strictly exercised in MDR-TB patients with infectivity. In this context, patients should be cared in an isolation ward and dialysis should be performed in areas with appropriate airborne precaution facilities.",

The investigation of febrile patients in a dialysis unit should begin with proper history taking and physical examination. 192 The history should include the onset and time course of fever, associated symptoms, travel and contact history, as well as zoonotic and occupational exposures. Special attention should be directed to the dialysis access such as the PD or HD catheter exit sites and AV fistula/graft. 193, 194 Initial laboratory investigations include complete blood picture, liver and renal biochemistry, peripheral blood culture, chest radiography and other appropriate microbiological studies (e.g. sputum culture, urine culture, nasopharyngeal aspirate and wound swab cultures). Clinical samples relevant to the patient's mode of dialysis should also be obtained (e.g. peritoneal fluid cell count and culture in PD patients, blood culture from central catheter in HD patients). Serum IgE levels can also be checked if allergy to components of the HD circuit is suspected. Empirical antibiotics should be promptly initiated after appropriate microbiological samples have been obtained. The choice of empirical antibiotics should take into consideration the presenting clinical features, underlying medical diseases, spectrum of coverage, as well as the previous culture and susceptibility pattern of organisms isolated from the patient. For instance, dialysis patients who received immunosuppressive treatments or suffered from neutropenia or septicemia should receive more broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Unusual pathogens such as atypical organisms, mycobacteria, fungi or MDRO should be considered if patients respond poorly to first-line antibiotics. Removal of PD or HD catheter should be warranted in patients with profound sepsis or poor response to medical therapy. 42 Alternative causes of fever such as drug fever, autoimmune diseases, malignancy or allergy to the components in the HD circuit should also be properly excluded. 192, [195] [196] [197] Limitations There is currently no established guideline on the workup and treatment of febrile patients in dialysis units. The investigation and empirical treatment of febrile patients depends on the clinical presentation, underlying medical diseases, previous culture and susceptibility profiles and local clinicians' experience.",

The data should help refine the current protocol for the management of febrile patients in a dialysis unit. The primary objective of S. aureus screening programs is to identify at risk patients and perform carrier decolonization to reduce individual risk of infection. Previous studies have addressed the effectiveness of screening and decolonization as part of broader policies to limit the spread of MRSA. 125, 149, [198] [199] [200] [201] Most of these studies employed a quasiexperimental design, with institution of several preventive measures at the same time. While these studies have suggested the effectiveness of screening/decolonization strategies, the positive results might be confounded by publication bias. Recent advances in PCR-based screening have prompted larger and better-designed studies to address this issue and have generated some conflicting results. [199] [200] [201] Based on these data, the practice of routine screening for MRSA in dialysis patients remained controversial. However, active surveillance should be undertaken when there is an established outbreak. 126, 127 Limitations The epidemiology of S. aureus, especially MRSA is complex and poorly understood. Screening and decolonization strategies are often implemented as part of a broader infection control program, and thus the individual benefits of screening, contact precaution and decolonization remained unclear.",

The attempts to decolonize MRSA carriers can be limited by recolonization and emergence of resistance to mupirocin or other antimicrobials.

This has been well demonstrated by the initial emergence of vancomycin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended spectrum betalactamase producing-and carbapenemase producingenterobacteriaceae in renal dialysis patients. The onset of invasive infection by these multidrug-resistant bacteria often starts as asymptomatic colonization of skin and mucosa of renal patients, which is followed by invasive disease at Tenckhoff or HD indwelling vascular devices. Thirty to forty per cent of chronic HD patients receive at least one dose of antimicrobials as outpatient over a 1-year period. In many public hospitals, up to 30% of these antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately according to the improved protection against CMV in transplantation (IMPACT) guidelines. [208] [209] [210] [211] During our daily antibiotic auditing meeting, we find that the most common mistakes include 1. Failure to de-escalate to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic; 2. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of an infection such as skin and soft tissue infections are not satisfied; 3. The choice and duration for surgical prophylaxis for vascular-access-related procedures are not following the IMPACT guideline; 4. The most commonly abused antibiotics are vancomycin, and third-or fourth-generation cephalosporins.",
