Unprecedented proportions of the employment sectors in the USA and Canada have filed for unemployment benefits. Statistics Canada reported, on April 9, 2020, that one-in-ten working-age individuals (i.e., fifteen years of age and over) in Canada lost their jobs or worked less than half their usual hours as a result of the widespread restrictions imposed in March 2020 (Government of Canada, Statistics Canada, 2020).",

We recognize that no single variable accounts for completed suicide within individuals or populations. We additionally recognize that no single macroeconomic indicator is sufficiently predictive of suicide. Notwithstanding, it was observed during the Great Recession in the USA, Canada, and various economies of Europe, as well as Asia, that the change in unemployment rate was highly associated with increase in suicide rates (Chang et al., 2009; Reeves et al., 2014 Reeves et al., , 2012 Stuckler et al., 2009) .

It was reported in several countries in Europe after the Great Recession (e.g., Denmark) that social spending on emergency healthcare/mental healthcare, wage subsidies, supplemental income, and work retraining mitigated risk of suicide (Peeples, 2019) . It was also reported in Japan, as well, during the Great Depression, that increased social spending significantly mitigated suicide completion (Matsubayashi et al., 2020) .",

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation of telemedicine/telehealth; clinicians are encouraged to incorporate the assessment of mental health amongst all patients including, but not limited to, those previously diagnosed with mental illness. Social isolation measures are critical to reduce the spread of the coronavirus and a recently conducted analysis also indicates that during the Great Depression those cities in the USA that had the most rapid and robust social isolation measures also witnessed the greatest economic rebound (Stuckler et al., 2009) . A policy approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be informed by the projection of possible suicides to prevent excess suicides in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For example, wage subsidies, forbearance on financial obligation, government support of small business, work retraining programs, and access to community-based support programs can all serve as primary prevention. We also believe that the creation of virtual, as well as conventional, services that provide timely access to high quality mental health assessment and, where appropriate, specific treatment for persons at risk of mental illness are urgently needed. Finally, we assert that specialized services with an emphasis on psychiatric first aid available in communities and co-localized with other medical services will be especially relevant as a mechanism to reduce suicide at this time. Suicide mortality in 2020 and 2021 were projected for three scenarios of change in unemployment rates: no change (i.e., 5.9% in 2020 and 6.0% in 2021 as published in the 2019 Federal Budget), moderate increase (i.e., 7.5% in 2020, 7.2% in 2021), and extreme increase (i.e., 16.6% in 2020, 14.9% in 2021).
