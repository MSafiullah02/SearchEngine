Thus, drug repositioning, also known as redirecting, repurposing, and reprofiling [4,5], emerges as an effective possibility for generating new treatments against COVID-19. Repositioning is defined as a new use of a drug, in addition to its original indication(s), and is an option for rapid identification of new therapeutic agents. The availability of drug-related information, such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity [6], is an important advantage in the research efforts to quickly find an effective treatment for this deadly virus.",

Several authors report the potential of chloroquine as a therapeutic option against this virus: in vitro it presented an EC50 of 1.13 \u00b5m and in vivo it caused a negative conversion of the virus in more than 100 patients who were participating in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China [7,8]. In the in vitro study performed by Liu et al. (2020), both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibited the virus from entering the cell and, at later cell stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, blocked virus transport between cell organelles, which is considered a determining step for the release of viral genome in cells in the case of SARS-CoV-2. However, chloroquine was observed to have a higher efficacy [9].",

There is also expectation for the results of the WHO solidarity initiative, which consisted of a worldwide call for a clinical study to simultaneously research the efficacy of four drugs, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for the treatment of patients affected with COVID-19 [12].
