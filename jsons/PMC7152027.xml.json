This is partly due to longer duration of travel and closer proximity to the local population.\u2022\nImmune status: Migrants returning to their home countries may be immune to certain infections, such as hepatitis A and acute schistosomiasis; however, they may incorrectly consider themselves immune to others, such as malaria. Consequently, VFR travelers are less likely to seek pre-travel advice, take malaria prophylaxis, or receive vaccines.4 Travelers with HIV, malignancy, or on immunosuppressant drugs are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, including non-typhoidal Salmonella and penicilliosis.\u2022\nRisk activities: Certain activities are an exposure risk (e.g., freshwater swimming and schistosomiasis, unprotected sexual intercourse and HIV).\n",
