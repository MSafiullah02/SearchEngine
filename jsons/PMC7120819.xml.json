Blood and marrow hematopoietic stem cells have become accepted and, in some instances, established approach to treat incurable neoplastic diseases and congenital disorders of immune system [1]. Similarly, use of allografts in patients with end-stage organ disease involving the liver, kidneys, intestines, heart, and lungs has provided a possibility for continuation of life and a potential for patients to integrate and resume participation in their communities [2]. Recent advances in limb, integument, and face transplantation underscore the substantial leap forward in restoring normalcy for individuals with devastating and often catastrophic physical encumbrance [3, 4].",

The conflict arises from aforementioned disconnect between immune recognition of self versus nonself [7, 8]. These transplanted stem cells install foreign effector immune cells in the recipient, and if remain unabated, the resulting graft-versus-host disease is capable of unleashing potentially ruinous systemic inflammation resulting in irreversible tissue damage and death [7]. The stem cell graft restores immunity and functional marrow in patients in need for myeloablative antineoplastic therapy. Furthermore, it is the foreign, graft-mediated, adaptive cancer immune surveillance that has now been widely recognized as the pivotal feature that sustains cancer in remission following successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This feature of stem cell graft-assisted antitumor response is recognized as \u201cgraft-versus-leukemia or graft-versus-tumor effect.\u201d Donor-derived adaptive antitumor immunity is an important objective of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, especially in patients with hematologic malignancies, and forms the bases for donor lymphocyte infusions to treat cancer recurrences during posttransplant period [9]. As in patients following solid organ transplants, in recipients of allogeneic HSCT, anti-GVHD therapy is assessed and continuously refined to achieve the lowest possible cumulative iatrogenic immune suppression required to prevent or treat GVHD, whereas an earnest attempt is made for preservation of recipients\u2019 immune function such that the risk of conventional and opportunistic infections and malignancies do not overwhelm the projected efficacy and feasibility of these lifesaving procedures.",

Severity of immune dysfunction is in most instance a direct consequence of treatment with these agents that are commonly prescribed as combination drug regimens. Cyclosporine was the first major breakthrough in this regard; subsequent generation calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have improved therapeutic index although resultant severe immune suppression and the risk for opportunistic infection like CMV, BK virus, and certain posttransplant cancers question the therapeutic feasibility for agents such as tacrolimus, especially in patients with low risk for allograft-related complications. Serious infections due to cytomegalovirus including viremia and end-organ disease, BK virus viremia, viruria, and BK virus allograft nephropathy with risk for potential graft compromise, rare progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to polyomavirus, higher potential for opportunist cancers such as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, EBV lymphoproliferative disorders among others, are well-recognized limitations in individuals given tacrolimus for extended duration with doses leading to prolong high serum drug concentration [11]. Experience with sirolimus, a macrolide xenobiotic that induces potent immune suppression via inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR; a conserved threonine and serine protein kinase) was associated with lower incidence of CMV infection in solid organ transplant recipients. This protective antiviral effect of mTOR inhibitors against BK virus nephropathy after renal transplantation has not been noted consistently. Additionally, antitumor properties of mTOR inhibitors may favorably influence the lower incidence and risk for posttransplant malignancies in recipients of solid organ allografts, especially those with a profile that indicates low risk for graft rejection [12].",

Cord blood stem cells are regarded as a major breakthrough for source that yields a steady supply of hematopoietic stem cells, especially among patients with difficult to find, immunologically (HLA-matched) compatible hematopoietic stem cell graft [18]. Cord blood stem cells have a limited number of nucleated cells that are adequate for children. In adults due to larger body surface area, transplantation with less than optimum number of stem cells complicate posttransplant period with issues such as inadequate and delayed neutrophil engraftment and peripheral blood cell count recovery, precarious graft stability, and, similar to recipients of T-cell-depleted grafts, a higher risk for infections associated with severe and prolonged neutropenia or those observed during GVHD (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). Various strategies are being explored to assuage this limitation including transplantation with cord blood grafts from more than one donor and ex vivo expansion of a single donor cord blood graft to increase the yield of nucleated cells [21]. In a review of 100 cord blood transplants at a comprehensive cancer center in Houston, Texas, the infection incidence rate ratio, which was total infection episodes per days at risk (survival after CBT) \u00d7 100, was 2.4 times higher in adult patients compared with children [22]. It was important to note that risk of infection was even greater (three times higher) in adults with neutropenia and was 1.9 times higher in patients with GVHD when compared with children undergoing CBT procedure [22].\n",

Pretransplant colonization due to VRE, MRSA, or MDR GNB including MRD Pseudomonas, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and some food-borne fungi such as Fusarium spp., especially in transplant unit located in certain geographic areas, are thought to promote infections due to these pathogens \ndHyposplenism after HSCT is a late complication and commonly attributed to late-onset acute GVHD, most frequently noted in patients with chronic GVHD. It is however important to recognize that a number of allogeneic HSCT recipients without clinical diagnosis of GVHD may have functional hyposplenism and are at risk for severe, systemic infection due to encapsulated bacteria \neIndwelling prosthetic devices including intravascular access catheters; surgical drains; implanted prosthesis such as heart valves, joints, biliary, bronchial, urinary tract stents; and other various implantable surgical devices promote infections due to CoNS and Candida spp. that commonly colonizes the skin and genitourinary and orointestinal tracts \nfListeria bacteremia and meningitis are rare complications in patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis for PCP. The incidence of bacterial meningitis is 30-fold higher in HSCT recipients compared with persons without HSCT. As expected, patients undergoing allograft stem cell transplant are at a significant higher risk compared with those undergoing autologous HSCT (70 vs. 16 per 100 000 patients per year). In HSCT recipients Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen associated with bacterial meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus mitis; listeriosis may be rarely seen \ngIncreasing frequency of multidrug-resistant strains to fluorinated quinolones and regional high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing GNB including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has seriously curtailed treatment options for such infections.

Inherent or acquired drug resistance is a major concern in selection of effective empiric therapy for pathogens in this group, which may either lack the drug target site or produce extended-spectrum hydrolyzing enzymes aginst a variety of commonly used antimicrobials; these bacteria may also exhibit phenotypes with reduced expression of outer membrane porins and/or heightened expression of efflux pumps among other mechanisms for antimicrobial drug resistance  \njOrointestinal mucositis increases the risk of CDAD and so does exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials and possibly antineoplastic chemotherapy-induced alteration in hosts\u2019 intestinal protective anaerobic microbiota \nkIt now considered standard of care to perform interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection; treatment with isoniazid is considered gold standard and should be administered for a minimum of 6 months prior to the transplantation procedure, with the aim to prevent active tuberculosis infection during the post-transplant period. Such infections tend to be more serious and, due to potential drug toxicity and drug-drug interaction, often difficult to treat after allograft transplantation  \nl\nM. kansasii leads to clinical disease indistinguishable from M. tuberculosis infection; risk for infection relapse, drug resistance, and infection recalcitrance are reason for longer duration of therapy \nmIn a recent study from South Korea, in 7342 SOT and 1266 HSCT recipients, 22 patients developed NTM after a median 2 years following transplantation. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex was the most common pathogen isolated; nodular bronchiectasis (~80%) was common presentation. A near 70% response to antimicrobial therapy in this group was encouraging. However, disseminated NTM including MAC disease in severely immunosuppressed patients following high-risk allogeneic HSCT may occasionally present as salvage therapy-refractroy recalcitrant bacteremia with high fatality  \nnRisk of CMV infection is highest in CMV-seronegative recipients in whom allograft is given from a CMV-seropositive donor. Ganciclovir prophylaxis effectively prevents CMV disease in high-risk patients during the first 100 days after allogeneic HSCT \noLate CMV disease is associated with high mortality rate nearing 45% and seen 170 median days after HSCT. It is important to recognize that close to 40% of patients that respond to the initial episode of late posttransplant CMV infection will develop a second CMV episode within a median of 11\u201312 weeks. Three months after HSCT, patients with positive CMV-pp65 antigenemia; post-engraftment severe lymphopenia of less than 100 lymphocytes/mm3, especially those with helper T-cell lymphocytopenia of less than 50 cells/mm3; presence of GVHD; and those with undetectable CMV-specific T-cell responses are at higher risk for late CMV end-organ disease. Furthermore, after 100 days following transplantation, presence of CMV viremia or pp65 antigenemia and severe lymphopenia endorsed by less than 300 lymphocytes/mm3 is considered strong predictors for late CMV disease and death  \npMost frequently detected viruses in symptomatic HSCT or SOT recipients with URTI are picornaviruses (~40%), such as rhinovirus and enterovirus, whereas coronavirus and influenza are isolated in nearly 20% of such patients, each. Influenza URTIs similar to RSV and unlike parainfluenza virus infections have the potential for progression to the lower respiratory tract. Viral pneumonitis is a serious complication in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is important to recognize that hosts\u2019 immune response to influenza infection garners a high IFN-gamma state resulting in a transient increased susceptibility for secondary bacterial infections like pneumococcus, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas spp. The resulting superimposed bacterial pneumonia may precipitate life-threatening sepsis and respiratory failure. Furthermore, RTVIs are recognized as fostering enhanced susceptibility for invasive fungal lung disease during early and late transplant periods \nqSerologic evaluation of the donor and recipient for latent CMV infection is the cornerstone during pretransplant assessment. Dissonance between D+ and R- CMV serology is the most important complicating factors during early and late posttransplant period. Antiviral prophylaxis, preemptive and empiric therapy approaches are based on CMV serologic disparities \nrIt is standard to provide prophylaxis for HSV and VZV during preparatory conditioning regimen and continue during the early post-HSCT period. Prophylaxis may have to be extended in patients with acute GVHD, cancer recurrence, patients undergoing high-risk transplantation procedure, and those with primary or secondary allograft compromise \nsHHV-6 high-grade viremia by DNA analysis has been associated with central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, although viral interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis is not an uncommon disease attributed to HHV6 infection following allogeneic HSCT. HHV6 may also present as limbic encephalitis with subcortical temporal lobe seizure activity presenting as memory loss and insomnia. Febrile partial or complete myelosuppression and/or skin rash should alert the physicians regarding HHV6 as a potential treatable cause of secondary stem cell allograft loss. Viral gastroduodenitis, colitis, and pericarditis are other clinical manifestations attributed to HHV6 infection in this vulnerable population. An association with post-HSCT HHV6 viremia with delayed monocyte and platelet engraftment, increased platelet transfusion requirements, risk for high-grade GVHD, and all-cause mortality needs further evaluation \ntEarly CMV low-grade viremia was observed by the use of ultrasensitive nucleic assays, within 3\u20134 weeks after high-risk allogeneic stem cell graft transplantation \nuThe incidence of adenovirus disease ranges from 3% to as high as 47% in high-risk pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients. Patients undergoing T-cell-depleted stem cell grafts and those with acute graft-versus-host disease are also at increased risk for severe life-threatening adenovirus disseminated disease, which is a well-recognized complication in patients with persistent peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of <300 cells/mm3. Infection involves respiratory (viral pneumonitis), gastrointestinal (colitis, including hemorrhagic colitis) tracts, and hepatitis;patients may present with posttransplant hemorrhagic cystitis. Adenovirus dissemination represents severity of underlying immune defect and is seen in 10\u201320% of patients with end-organ viral disease, except in patients with adenovirus cystitis, where disseminated adenoviral disease is seldom observed \nvLong-term (>30 days) viral shedding is not uncommon in patients following allogeneic HSCT; RSV is notable RTVI in this regard. The 80 days of median duration of viral shedding may extend to just under a year in some allogeneic transplant recipients. This potential for pronged viral shedding warrants heightened awareness and strict adherence to appropriate precautions to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission to other vulnerable hospitalized patients. In the pediatric HSCT recipients, RSV infection within 60 days after transplant, patients given systemic corticosteroids within a week prior to the onset of RSV infection and the need for assisted mechanical ventilation were significant predictors for subsequent complications and death \nwThe BK virus was first isolated in 1971; after primary childhood infection, persistent BKV infection occurs within renal tubular cells and the urothelium. Viral reactivation in the recipients of kidney and allogeneic HSCT usually presents as allograft nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis, respectively. Presently, reduction in drug-induced immune suppression, when possible, and supportive care are the only viable treatment option; direct antiviral drug against BKV remains elusive \nxEBV influence over B-cell malignant clones may act through different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and possibly variance in genetic mechanisms that eventually determined viral latency during early EBV infection and EBV-host interaction \nyThe incidence of hMPV infection was similar to the incidence of RSV or parainfluenza virus UTRIs in patients undergoing HSCT. hMPV infections are notable for low risk of progression to the LRT. Serious systemic hMPV disease including viral encephalitis has been reported. Overall, these infections are well-tolerated, albeit hMPV pneumonitis in severely immunosuppressed stem cell allograft recipients may result in serious life-threatening lung disease \nzParvo B19 infection may present as pure red cell aplasia after allogeneic HSCT \naahCoV similar to hMPV is a common RTV. Serotypes associated with disease in transplant population include hCoV-OC43 followed by NL63, HKU1; 229E is less common. Unlike hMPV, these infections have a higher likelihood for progressing to the LRT, which often presents as subclinical, mild to moderate viral illness. In an observation among HSCT recipients, hCoV infection resulted in a notable number (~20%) of hospitalizations. In concert with hMPV infection, despite presence of severe immune suppression, hCoV-related confirmed deaths in allogeneic HSCT recipients remain less than 5%. Approximately one-third of transplant patients with hCoV infection may have infection due to other RTVs such as human bocavirus (HBoV). HBoV is an uncommon RTV in transplant patients and often (> 80%) seen with other RTVs. HBoV rarely causes LRTI; most infections are well-tolerated despite, transplant-related severe immune suppression \nabJohn Cunningham virus (JCV)-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an uncommon disease in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In a report from Israel, 20 of 40 patients (24%) with JCV reactivation had persistent viremia after receiving myeloablative and nonmyeloablative pretransplant conditioning. PML was diagnosed in two patients with persistent JCV viremia, 96 and 127 days after HSCT. Advanced age was a significant predictor of JCV reactivation; 70% of these allogeneic HSCT recipients with persistent viral reactivation had died. Identifying high-risk patients with persistent JCV reactivation, especially those with incremental levels of viremia, may benefit from reduced drug-induced immune suppression for prevention of JCV leukoencephalopathy. PML continues to remain a devastating, albeit rare posttransplant infectious complication. Artesunate, an antimalarial drug that showed potent ex vivo activity against HHV-6, however, clinical response to artesunate in HSCT recipients with JCV-PML, has not been encouraging \nacCandidemia is seen in patients with severe pre-engraftment neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500 cell/microliter) that extends longer than 5 days. The increase in non-albicans Candida spp. is mainly due to C. glabrata, although patients following HSCT are also at risk for C. krusei infection. Emergence of echinocandin resistance among clinical C. glabrata isolates is concerning. For patients with C. parapsilosis infection, it is recommended to use antifungal drugs other than echinocandin class. The emergence of MDR Candida auris infections in transplant population makes selection of empiric anti-yeast therapy more challenging  \nadGenetic susceptibility for IA include mutations in Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN among other well recognized risk factors such as high-risk allogeneic HSCT, CMV and respiratory virus infection, and positive Aspergillus PCR. It was recently noted that presence of three of the aforementioned factors generated a 57% probability for developing IA. In patients with no risk factors, the probability of IA was 2%, compared to ~80% in patients with four or more such risk factors \naeCMV reactivation after stem cell allograft transplantation increases the risk for IFD during the late transplant period. Unlike the risk factors for early IFD such as AML (HR 3), HLA antigen-mismatched donor graft (HR 3.4); HSCT recipients with lymphoma (HR 8.5), CMV reactivation (HR 5.5), and severe neutropenia (HR 3.5) are considered prominent risk factors for late-onset IFD. Patients with pretransplant IgG responses against Aspergillus proteins indicating significant fungal colonization or ongoing subclinical Aspergillus infections before preparatory conditioning regimen has commenced needs further clinical validation. Evaluation of 5589 HSCT recipients at a comprehensive cancer center between 1985 and 1999 showed increased incidence of IA after 1992 and remained high during that decade. The authors also reported increasing frequency of non-Aspergillus molds such as Fusarium spp. and mucormycosis in the late 1990s. These non-Aspergillus molds were prominent in patients undergoing multiple transplants. Most cases of mucormycosis were seen during the late transplant period, especially in patients with chronic GVHD. In patients undergoing nonmyeloablative HSCT, presence of severe acute GVHD, chronic extensive GVHD, and CMV infection are prominent risk factors for IFD \nafInvasive aspergillosis is a complication seen in patients with delayed (>2 weeks) recovery of peripheral blood granulocyte count. Patients receiving high-dose systemic corticosteroids are also at an increased risk. Aspergillus fumigatus remains the most prevalent mold to cause invasive human disease, including in patients undergoing HSCT. Infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. are occasionally seen in hematopoietic stem cell allograft recipients and commonly present during the period(s) of severe and prolonged neutropenia \nagRoutine blood cultures have low sensitivity for diagnosis of fungemia. Carbohydrate biomarker (1, 3)-\u03b2-d-glucan has emerged as a useful laboratory test for the diagnosis of invasive yeast and mold disease. Furthermore, it may be used to monitor response to systemic antifungal therapy and infection relapse \nahPost-HSCT recovery of antigen-specific T lymphocyte-mediated immune response against CMV and Candida albicans is regarded as critical during the early and the late transplant period. Most patients develop antigen-specific T-cell response early in the transplant period which is derived from clones of both donor and recipient stem cell origin. Reconstitution of immune response via antigen-specific T lymphocytes of recipient origin is weakened in patients with GVHD. Incidence of IC during the 1st year after nonmyeloablative (5%) and myeloablative transplant conditioning is lower than that for IA (14%). Echinocandin nonsusceptible Candida spp. infection has been recently recognized as an emerging challenge in providing care for these highly vulnerable patients \naiPCP is a serious OI in transplant patients with severe cellular immune defect(s). Routine anti-PCP prophylaxis breakthrough infections are rare; although in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine, atypical upper lung PCP may occasionally occur \najInvasive zygomycosis or mucormycosis may occur disproportionally more frequently in patients on voriconazole prophylaxis and those with sinuorbital invasive mold disease. In transplant patients, the overall prevalence is less than 8% among all invasive fungal infections \nakNearly half of the patients with disseminated fusariosis have evidence of fungemia, and close to 80% may exhibit multiple (>10\u201315) papular skin lesions with a necrotic center that is indistinguishable from ecthyma gangrenosum due to Staphylococcus aureus or disseminated Pseudomonas spp. infection \nalDematiaceous or melanin pigmented molds are associated with chronic localized infections and prevalent in certain geographic regions. In transplant patients, disseminated infections may occur; neurotropism is an important feature of these infections, and treatment with older antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B and early generation triazole-based compounds was associated with high rates of treatment failure \namThe cumulative incidence of CNS infection following HSCT is <1% within first 30 days, 2% within 3 months, and 5% after 5 years following transplantation. Significantly high risk of CNS infection 5 years after CBT (8%) vs. matched related HSCT (2%) is important to note for the purpose of risk stratification. CNS fungal (35%) and viral (32%) infections are prominent, whereas toxoplasmosis and bacterial infection are seen in just over 10% of the patients. Aspergillosis is common (67%) followed by Cryptococcus neoformans (17%). CNS infection in transplant population is associated with high mortality (59%), and low (20%) 5-year overall survival  \nanDonor-derived toxoplasmosis has been reported along with cases of brucellosis in the endemic regions, along with West Nile virus infection, rabies, Chagas disease, and rare cases of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection \nao\nStrongyloides stercoralis (pinworm or threadworms and Enterobius vermiculari) in the underdeveloped countries where fecal contamination of soil and water is common; evaluation of allogeneic transplant candidates requires serologic evaluation for exposure and if present, appropriate treatment should be completed for intestinal subclinical parasitic infestation prior to the trasnplantation procedure \napIn patients with extensive T-cell immune defects, Strongyloides stercoralis may cause accelerated autoinfection. Hyperinfection pulmonary syndrome in such patients is almost always fatal. Screening serology tests for the presence of strongyloidiasis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after allogeneic HSCT may be falsely negative; and stool ova and parasite examination, in the absence of accelerated autoinfection during the pretransplant, is also riddled with low sensitivity \naqAmerican trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi needs to be assessed in patients planned to undergo allograft transplant procedure from endemic regions \narLeishmania is transmitted by the bite of certain species of sand flies and presents as cutaneous (common) and visceral (uncommon and severe) disease; pretransplant evaluation should include serologic testing for prior exposure to these parasites in appropriate patients with high risk for prior exposure \nAbbreviations: GVHD graft-versus-host disease, HSV herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, CMV cytomegalovirus, VZV varicella zoster virus, HHV6 human herpesvirus 6, EBV Epstein-Barr virus, CoNS coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, CDAD Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, GPB gram-positive bacteria, GNB gram-negative bacteria, HSCT hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, hMPV human metapneumovirus, hCoV human coronavirus hypervirulent subtypes NL63 and HKU1, PML progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, EBV-PTLD Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, HR hazard ratio, IFD invasive fungal disease, IA invasive aspergillosis, IC invasive candidiasis, SOT solid organ transplant, URTI upper respiratory tract infection, LRTI lower respiratory tract infections, RTV respiratory tract virus, RTVIs respiratory tract viral infections, hCoV human coronavirus",
