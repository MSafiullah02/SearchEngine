This classification system is based on whether: the biological agent is pathogenic to humans, represents a hazard to soldiers, it is transmissible to nearby community and if there is a possible effective treatment available [8\u201311]. Consequently, BAs are classified into four risk groups (RG), namely, RG1, RG2, RG3 and RG4, as follows:RG1 that includes BAs not linked with diseases in healthy adult humans. Examples of RG1 agents include Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli-K12, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) types 1 through 4 [9, 10].RG2 that includes BAs connected with human diseases which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. Examples of RG2 agents include Salmonella sp., Chlamydia psittaci, measles virus, and hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses [9, 10].RG3 that contains BAs associated with serious or lethal human diseases for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available (high individual risk but low community risk). Examples of RG3 agents include Brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Coccidioides immitis, yellow fever virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 [9, 10].RG4 includes BAs that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high individual risk and high community risk). RG4 agents only include viruses. Examples of RG4 agents consist of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Ebola virus and herpesvirus simiae (B-virus). Under the classification system, These Risk Group 1 agents are the least hazardous whilst Group 4 are the most hazardous [9, 10].\n",

The first step toward the development of an AMP-based, label-free electronic biosensor consisted of targeting the microbial cells by magainin I using impedance spectroscopy. It should be repeated that electrical impedance measures the total opposition to a circuit or a part of the circuit presented to an electric current. Usually the impedance is the results for both resistance and reactance. It is important to remember that the resistance component arises from collisions of the current-carrying charged particles with the internal structure of the conductor. Furthermore, the reactance component is an additional opposition to the movement of the electric charge that result from the changing magnetic and electric fields in circuits carrying alternating current.",

It should be specified that magainin I contains a cysteine residue on the C terminus (Fig. 4.2b), which allows the facile site-specific covalent attachment to the gold electrodes. Next, the heat-killed bacterial cells are injected and incubated on the AMP-modified electrodes [25]. When, the bacteria are recognized by the AMPs, binding will ensue (Fig. 4.2c), causing the dielectric property to changes that can be monitored by a spectrum analyzer. Usually, the impedance is measured over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 kHz. Figure 4.2d shows an optical micrograph of the device, which is made using standard microfabrication techniques.\n",

When, a blank device with no immobilized AMPs was also tested for comparison, it was found that there was no change in the impedance of the blank device without immobilized AMPs, upon exposure to various bacterial concentrations. Figure 4.3a shows that at low frequencies, the different concentrations of bacterial cells have the effect of increasing the impedance in proportion to the number of cells present in the sample. As the frequency increases, the contribution to the impedance from the bacterial cells decreases, leaving only the dielectric relaxation of small dipoles including water molecules in the buffer solution to affect the measured impedance. Figure 4.3b depicts the impedance change at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz. The variation in the impedance is directly proportional to the number of bacterial cells bound to the immobilized AMPs and manifested in a logarithmic increase with respect to serially diluted bacterial concentrations. Significantly, the detection limit of response of the hybrid AMP-microelectrode device to E. coli was found to be 103 cfu\u2215mL (1 bacterium\u2215\u03bcL). This lowest limit of detection appears to be limited by the presence of impedance due to the electrical double layer resulting from the electrode polarization effect at low frequencies. Notably, these sensitivity limits is clinically relevant [30] and compares favorably to AMP-based fluorescent assays [26], antibody-based impedance sensors [27], and to the LAL test [25].\n",

The selectivity was first investigated using fluorescent microscopy methods, by staining bacterial cells and optically mapping their binding density to gold films hybridized with AMPs. The discriminative binding patterns of immobilized magainin I to and the surface density of the various bacterial cells (all 107 cfu/mL) stained with propidium iodide (PI) nucleic acid stain are showed in Fig. 4.5. In summary, coupling of AMPs with microcapacitive biosensors has resulted in the implementation of a portable, label-free sensing platform for the detection of infectious agents. The achievable sensitivity approached 1 bacterium\u2215\u03bcL-a clinically relevant limit-and the AMPs allowed for sufficient selectivity to distinguish pathogenic and Gram-negative bacteria, while retaining broadband detection capabilities [25\u201328]. In addition, the simulated water sampling chip which consisted of a microfluidic flow cell integrated onto the hybrid sensor, demonstrated the potential of real-time on-chip monitoring of the interaction of E. coli cells with the antimicrobial peptides [25].\n",

The immobilization chemistry strongly depends upon the underlying SAW substrate with or without a guiding layer and hence on the chemical environment available.

Analyte-specific molecules (e.g., antibodies) are immobilized on the SAW device to catch analyte molecules (e.g., antigens) from the sample stream.

QDs presenting available carboxylic acids from their capping agents may also be covalently attached to the epsilon amine of an antibody\u2019s lysine residues by using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry [47\u201353].

Initially, miRNAs were oxidized with sodium periodate to oxidize the ribose 2\u2032- and 3\u2032- hydroxyl groups into aldehydes. The resulting dialdehyde was then reacted with biotin-X-hydrazide resulting in biotinylated miRNA. This was followed by immobilizing the 5\u2032 amine-modified oligonucleotide probes antisense to miRNAs on the amine-reactive glass slides. The biotinylated miRNAs were captured on the microarray by oligonucleotide probes in hybridization. Quantum dots were labeled on the captured miRNAs through the strong specific interaction of streptavidin and biotin. As QDs have a high extinction coefficient and a high quantum yield, so trace amounts of miRNAs are easily detected with a laser confocal scanner. In addition as alternative, the colorimetric gold\u2013silver detection method was used in which captured miRNAs were labeled with streptavidin-conjugated gold followed by silver enhancement. During silver enhancement, the gold nanoparticles bound to miRNAs catalyzed the reduction of silver ions to metallic silver, which further autocatalyzed the reduction of silver ions to form metallic silver precipitation on gold, resulting in a signal enhancement [53]. This process allowed straightforward detection of the microarray with an ordinary charge-coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on a microscope.\n",

FRET has been extensively used in biophysical and biochemical studies to probe ligand-receptor binding and molecular structural changes [56\u201358]. In the following example, the authors incubated the dye-labeled DNA targets with biotinylated capture DNA probes, which were allowed to be conjugated to streptavidin QDs, only when the two DNA sequences hybridize. The resulting hybridization was then detected via FRET between the QD and the dye acceptor (Fig. 4.12) [54]. It should be noted that the additional background caused by the acceptor direct excitation is virtually eliminated through the choice of an appropriate excitation wavelength; this led to a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to single organic dye molecular beacon-based detection. This type of sensing schemes can also be amenable to use in a multiplex format. The narrow and symmetric QD emissions allow easy spectral deconvolution and the most straightforward configuration relies on several QD populations interacting with the same dye acceptor, rather than the opposite [54].\n",

It should be mentioned that state-of-the-art immunoassays take at least 15 min, whereas polymerase chain reaction (PCR) takes longer than 30 min. The novel genetic-engineering system developed by Petrovick et al. have consisted of the efficient production of B-cell lines that can react specifically and rapidly to a variety of pathogens [59]. The antibody genes were cloned from hybridomas and inserted into expression vectors. These were transfected into a parental B cell line that expresses active aequorin, and the cells are screened for their response to pathogen. The genetically engineered CANARY cells can be used separately in a single identification assay, or as many as three can be combined to achieve a multiplexed assay. Alternatively, several antibodies can be expressed in a single cell line to provide a classification assay [59]. It is also feasible to create B cells that emit at different wavelengths of light, enabling multiplexed assays that simultaneously distinguish among several targets [59].",

The ability to identify nucleic acid (NA: DNA or RNA) sequences is central in the deduction of the first hard NA sequence information, concerning a new or genetically modified pathogen [59]. It is important to develop assays that have the flexibility to respond quickly to new threats. For this reason, developing NA probes allow for the rapid and quick examination of the actual genetics of the target organism [59]. Once the NA sequence of a pathogen is determined, multiple short probes are synthesized that bind adjacent to each other along a specific sequence on the target NA [59]. Consequently, Petrovick et al. developed a novel assay that uses a single CANARY cell line that expresses an antibody against digoxigenin. Each of these probes is labeled with a single digoxigenin molecule. If these probes are added to solution containing the target NA sequence, the binding of multiple digoxigenin-containing probes produces a tight cluster of immobilized digoxigenin molecules, which will stimulate light production from the CANARY cell (see Fig. 4.15) [59].\n",

The fluorescent tag is commonly incorporated into the target molecules, via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [74]. This primer labeling method is convenient when amplification is needed for detection, or when it is used to construct a cDNA library from a genomic RNA pool via reverse transcription. In addition, the derivatized fiber core experiments are able to detect unlabeled (non-fluorescent) target solutions 74]. This is achieved by competitive hybridization with fluorescent target samples. In this method, the fluorescent synthetic target complements are synthesized and initially hybridized to the array to saturate the array probe elements [68]. The unlabeled target solution is then hybridized to the same array, competing with the prehybridized synthetic targets. The presence of unlabeled target is determined by a fluorescence decrease caused by displacement of the fluorescent synthetic target by the unlabeled species. This procedure eliminates the need to incorporate fluorescence into the target and allows quantitative measurements to be performed. These fiber optic platforms are the basis for microsphere array designs that improved array fabrication and allowed extremely high-density sensor placement [68].",

A 530-nm excitation filter and a 580-nm emission filter were used for TAMRA. That is detection of amplified DNA fragments which were incubated with a fluorescein-labeled sequencing primer in the presence of the two allelic ROX-ddNTP or TAMRA-ddNTP terminators. All targets were labeled with fluorescein. It was shown that the fluorescence intensity was proportional to the extent of hybridization at each probe position [72A]. In addition, the camera was equipped with an internal chip that provides megapixel resolution (1280/1024). This megapixel chip was able to resolve the arrays miniatured feature sizes (3 mm) and provided multiple pixels for each optical channel in the fiber bundle (Fig. 4.19).\n",

When there is no change in the reflective index of the sensing medium, the plasmon oscillation cannot be formed (Fig. 4.20a). In addition, it should be noted that when the surface of the sensing material has been coated through biomolecule attachment only, there will be perhaps an unnoticed small change in the reflective index of the sensing medium, and as a result, the plasmon oscillation cannot be formed (Fig. 4.20c, left side) [79]. However, when the metal surface has been coated with an analyte-biorecognition couple of biomolecules, detection is accomplished by measuring the changes in the reflected light obtained on a detector (Fig. 4.20c, right side). In addition, the amount of surface concentration can be quantified by monitoring the reflected light intensity or tracking the resonance angle shifts.

This was followed by washing with PBS and measuring the SPR angle that has shifted nearly to the baseline [85]. When the BoNT/A antibodies are injected on the CM5 chip an increase in SPR angle was observed. Finally, washing with 1000 mM ethanolamine was performed to prevent non-specific binding and to block the unreacted NHS-ester groups on CM5 chip.
