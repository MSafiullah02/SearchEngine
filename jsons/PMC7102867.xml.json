            "text": "Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV) is a vascular thrombotic condition causing obstruction of arteries and veins in the fetal circulation of the placenta, resulting in ischemic changes in the villi peripheral to the obstruction. When sufficiently extensive, FTV may cause a reduction in functional placental reserve or in other cases may be associated with additional thrombotic or thromboembolic events in the somatic vessels of the fetus itself. When extensive, the former condition can lead to fetal growth restriction or stillbirth, whereas the latter may result in infarcts of various fetal structures, such as the brain, kidney, or, rarely, an extremity, such as an arm or leg. As with intravascular clotting in general, causal factors of FTV include a combination of the triad of stasis (by compression of cord or aberrant vessels); a thrombophilic state, both genetic (eg, protein S or factor V Leiden) and acquired (anticardiolipin antibody and so forth); and vascular injury (inflammatory and localized compression). The most serious outcomes include growth restriction, neurologic injury, and perinatal death.Key Features FTV: Potential Morphologic or Clinical Associations and Sequelae\nObstructive cord lesion or cord accident (common)Admit to neonatal ICU; normal at discharge (common)Neonatal encephalopathy (%)Cerebral palsy (rare); includes cerebral infarct, porencephalic cyst, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathyStillbirth (uncommon)Intrauterine growth restriction (uncommon)OligohydramniosMaternal diabetes mellitus (common)Maternal autoimmune disease (lupus, anticardiolipin antibodies, and so forth) (uncommon)Severe acute respiratory syndrome (rare)Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii (rare)Transverse limb reduction (rare)Maternal thrombophilic state (occurs equally in nonthrombophilic mothers)\n\n",

As discussed previously, FTV occurs more frequently in placentas selected for clinical study than in unselected pregnancies, but the factors involved in selection of placentas for pathologic study are diverse and nonspecific: maternal hypertension and diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, abnormal fetal heart rate during labor, and so forth. Ultrasound and other imaging techniques do not detect FTV. When there seems to be some sort of fetal distress during labor, there is no way to suggest that the actual cause of these symptoms is FTV until the placenta is examined. In most cases, when FTV is identified on placental examination, the newborn usually appears well, there are no subsequent clinical abnormalities in the nursery, and the newborn goes home on schedule. Especially in more extensive or severe cases, FTV is associated significantly with neonatal encephalopathy,3 cerebral palsy,4 intrauterine growth restriction,5 stillbirth, oligohydramnios, and fetal cardiac anomalies.6 Cerebral infarcts may be the most common specific cerebral lesion associated with placental FTV.7\n",

At early stages, the integrity of the vessel wall is lost and fragmented endothelial nuclei persist, intermixed with masses of erythrocytes that spill out into the villous stroma and dissect into the walls of larger vessels. The stem vessel wall in HEV appears consistently disrupted with extravasation of red cells. The affected villi in HEV may appear filled, even expanded, by stromal hemorrhage. In time, the stem vessels of both FTV and HEV may show septation and the villi eventually become avascular and hyalinized.",

The clinical and pathologic features of typical FTV and HEV have many similarities. The villi and villous capillaries in the regions of placenta served by the occluded veins or arteries no longer function. In recent lesions (2\u20135 days), the capillary endothelial cells are at first fragmented (see Fig. 9B); then the red cells, also fragmented, are extravasated, sometimes extensively into the villous stroma (see Fig. 9A). Ultimately, both capillaries and red cells disappear (Fig. 10\n). In chronic villous lesions (4\u20135 weeks), only an acellular hyalinzed core remains, surrounded by the villous trophoblast, which remains viable (Fig. 11\n). The trophoblast layer survives because it is kept alive by the continued circulation of maternal blood in the intervillous space. Iron is deposited in the basement membrane beneath the trophoblast (Fig. 12\n) and in small clumps in the villous stroma as the red cells disappear.",

It should be emphasized that FTV, as well as other pathologic processes that affect the placenta, commonly begin long before delivery, but produce no symptoms, and, finally, as injury progresses, may produce nonspecific stress related alterations, such as bradycardia, occur at onset of labor. Often it is at this stressful time, hours before delivery, that the reduced placental function finally causes acute injury to the brain, kidneys, and other organs of the fetus, even though it is the older placental pathologic lesions that initiated the chain of events that culminated in the serious injuries that the newborn must face after delivery.",

In an autopsy series of 317 consecutive stillbirths at 15 to 40 weeks gestation, Avigliano and colleagues35 found 32 cases with thrombi in cord vessels, an incidence of 1:10. The larger incidence in this report may be related to an acceptance of fibrin identified only in phosphotungstic acid-hemotoxylin stains of cord as evidence of clots, even if lacking adherence and changes at the clot-endothelial interface in some cases; others in this study did show loss of endothelium and extravasation of red cells at the inner vessel margin.
