She was assessed as a nonsuspected COVID-19 case and a noncontrast CT kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) was arranged. The CT identified a distal 10 \u00a3 6 mm right ureteric stone causing hydronephrosis ( Fig. 1A) . At the base of her right lung, numerous foci of ground-glass appearances were noted, suggestive of COVID-19 (Fig. 1B) . She was isolated on a COVID-19 ward and a ureteric stent was inserted under spinal anesthesia the following day with full personal protective equipment (PPE). Ureteroscopy and stone fragmentation was not undertaken to reduce operative time, whilst spinal anesthesia avoided the need for ventilation with its attendant risks of respiratory compromise and aerosol generation. She was discharged the same evening with a plan for definitive stone surgery in several weeks' time. A subsequent nasopharyngeal swab test was positive for COVID-19 and she was instructed to self-isolate.",

Analysis of 112 positive cases from the \"Diamond Princess\" cruise ship revealed that 73% were asymptomatic, of whom 54% had lung opacities on CT. 1 PPE protocols vary widely, with some centers restricting PPE to those approaching suspected or confirmed cases only. Since COVID-19 may not give rise to respiratory symptoms or fever, a strong argument can be made that all those attending the emergency department or acute assessment units with other presenting complaints be assessed as \"possible\" cases until proven otherwise.",

A noncontrast CT KUB to investigate suspected ureteric colic will usually include the lung bases. In most situations, scan images are available prior to a radiologist report and clinical decision making is based upon self-reporting by urologists. It is therefore imperative that urologists pay close attention to ground-glass changes in the lung bases when interpreting a CT KUB to identify signs of COVID-19.",
