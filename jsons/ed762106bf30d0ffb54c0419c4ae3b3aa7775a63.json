Socio-cultural mechanisms linking LGBT stigma, depression, substance use, and HIV among LGBT persons in Lesotho are understudied. We explore associations between LGBT stigma, mental health stressors, and HIV vulnerabilities among LGBT persons in Lesotho. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 46 LGBT persons and six key informants (e.g. healthcare providers). Participants described depression, substance use, and HIV as mutually reinforcing and situated in larger social contexts of stigma. Alcohol use was a stigma coping strategy and a way to build LGBT connections. At the same time, alcohol use elevated HIV vulnerabilities by lowering condom use uptake. Pervasive stigma reinforced barriers to healthcare engagement. Community-led support and services were leveraged to navigate stigma, reduce HIV vulnerabilities, and ultimately improve health. Findings emphasize the key role contexts play in shaping sexual and mental health among LGBT persons in Lesotho.",

A syndemics framework deepens our understanding of the mechanisms by which social disparities, such as stigma and discrimination targeting LGBT persons in Lesotho, contribute to multiple interacting health epidemics [13] . Applying a syndemics approach has the potential to identify the roles that social environments, including poverty, stigma and violence, play in shaping interrelated health problems [13] . This approach is particularly salient for advancing health among LGBT persons who experience a greater global disease burden for HIV and mental health challenges [2, 14, 15] . As first proposed by Singer to describe interacting epidemics of substance use, violence and HIV [16] , syndemics theory refers to \"a set of closely intertwined and mutual enhancing health problems that significantly affect the overall health status of a population within the context of a perpetuating configuration of noxious social conditions\" (p. 99). Scholars have extended this conceptual framework to LGBT health, particularly due to associations between HIV vulnerabilities and mental health [17, 18] , problematic substance use [13] , and interpersonal victimisation [19] .",

Separately, a study with sexual minority women in Canada reported that harmful social conditions including low social support and economic insecurity mediated the pathway from sexual stigma to depression [26] . A large study with MSM across 151 countries found associations between social conditions including sexual stigma, violence, mental health challenges such as depression and substance use, and HIV vulnerabilities [27] .

Furthermore, a study with MSM in Mexico reported that 'outness' about same sex sexual practices moderated pathways between syndemic factors, including substance use, depression, and internalized stigma, to sexual risks [30] . A systematic review of protective factors among cisgender MSM with interacting HIV risk factors identified structural (socio-economic), interpersonal (relationships), and intrapersonal (coping strategies, cognitions and emotions) factors [31] associated with lower HIV risks. Notably all studies included in this systematic review were in high income countries. A qualitative study with Black MSM in the US [32] found that persons without interacting psychosocial health conditions (depression, substance use, sexual abuse) reported having supportive relationships that fostered a positive sense of identity and health in comparison with those experiencing multiple conditions. Modifiable social factors that can mitigate the effects of harmful social conditions and interacting health issues are understudied in LMIC at large [30] . Identifying these protective factors can inform contextually tailored interventions.",

This suggests that LGBT stigma will manifest differently across contexts, leading to systematic differences in the ways that syndemics are produced and experienced. Campbell and Cornish [34] theorize that enabling social environments for HIV prevention include the interacting dimensions of symbolic context, such as cultural perspectives, values and ideologies, material and political context, including access to resources and opportunities, and relational context focused on social capital and relationships with institutional and state actors. Ultimately, characterizing how LGBT stigma (symbolic context) contributes to social isolation and exclusion (relational context) that in turn leads to interacting health epidemics among LGBT communities in Lesotho is critical to informing evidence-based and rights-affirming interventions. In response, the goals of this manuscript are to address knowledge gaps regarding socio-cultural mechanisms that link LGBT stigma, depression, substance use, and HIV among the LGBT community in Lesotho. We explore the role of stigma in producing and perpetuating the risk of interacting health challenges among LGBT persons in Lesotho.",

Another participant shared the processes by which a lack of social acceptance elevated fears of disclosing one's LGBT identity, in turn contributing to depression: Some of them [ LGBT persons] may commit suicide because they cannot accept themselves; I have seen that happen. Some of them are afraid to come out, and that makes their lives difficult; especially women who feel like men. They may feel pressure to date a lot of men, in trying to prove they are not transgender or lesbian. They may also even get married and have kids. By the time they are ready to come out, they would have done so many things that would confuse society about their sexuality because the person was so afraid to come out for so long. Looking at that person's results of not having come out soon enough-such as the long list of ex-boyfriends, the marriage, the children, the society who is supposed to accept themthey will be depressed instead. (#2, lesbian woman) This narrative also reveals emotional (fear, social pressure, depression) and physical (suicide, condomless sex) sequalae of adverse social conditions (stigma), and the ways that society's lack of acceptance of LGBT persons played a role in reducing self-acceptance. Finally, this narrative suggests that there may be pressure to conform to heteronormative standards of engaging in opposite-gender marriage and having children due to fear of disclosure. Other participants discussed suicide as a response to social and religious exclusion: \"That is why some people end up choosing to commit suicide, feeling that there is no use in living, because they feel that not only are they not accepted in society, but they are also not accepted in the church.\" (#3, gay man) Another participant discussed that experiencing violence could result in suicidality among LGBT persons: \"maybe if I could look deeper, I would find incidences of violence in Lesotho, but we just choose to keep quiet and let it be. That's when we come across homosexual people who commit suicide because maybe something happened and they didn't say it.\" (#4, lesbian woman) Taken together, depression and suicide were noted as prevalent psychological responses to social exclusion.",

When you have not accepted yourself and you meet people who do not accept you, you'll end up even committing suicide, or doing drugs in order to feel accepted. The main thing is for you to accept all areas of your life. (#7, gay man) Social exclusion resulted in limited spaces for LGBT persons to socialize. Alcohol and drug use were connected with bars being a common place to meet other LGBT persons, including sex partners. When the interviewer asked a participant \"Why do you think LGBT people like to go drinking?\", a respondent described: \"often that is where we meet men, more than anywhere else.\" (#8, gay man) When persons meet sex partners in bars, alcohol use might reduce the likelihood of condom use, that in turn could elevate HIV exposure. A participant articulated how social exclusion could result in alcohol use and subsequent HIV vulnerabilities: \"I realize that since we are unaccepted we tend to have partners from the shebeens [bars]; we get drunk and things that we do when we are drunk makes people not to protect themselves during sex. This inevitably increases our chances of contracting HIV.\" (#9, gay man) Another participant reinforced the idea that drinking to reduce stigma related stress may also lower the likelihood of condom use: \"I think they find comfort in booze, because of criticism and all these negative things around them. Yes. I think when they are out drinking they get to relax and forget their problems for a while, I think they end up engaging in unprotected sex.\" (#10, lesbian woman) In this way we see that not only is there interaction between health epidemics (depression and suicide, substance use, HIV), but that each health issue is discussed in relation to harmful conditions of social exclusion and its psychological impacts, namely a lack of self-acceptance.",

Narratives around partner testing were common. For instance, a lesbian (#27) described: \"I am not going to deny the fact that I was promiscuous, but I was using protection. I now have only one partner and I told her that I see a future for us and that I wanted no mistakes. So, I asked that 'we go and get tested together, in order for us to know each other's status, and then everything will be well, when I am always aware of your status'.\" Another participant discussed how partner support for testing was health promoting and an important part of sexual intimacy: I used to encourage the person that I engage into love with to go for an HIV test, if not obviously we won't be in love or do unprotected sex. Truly in our community [ LGBT] we do protected sex not that we can't be pregnant, but the main reason is that we are avoiding sexual illnesses.

Using alcohol helped LGBT persons to cope with depression resulting from stigmatizing social contexts and was a tool to connect with other LGBT persons. Substance use, sexual violence, inadequate HIV prevention resources, and inequitable sexual relationship power converged to increase HIV vulnerabilities. Harmful social contexts emerged as the key factor contributing to the interacting issues of mental health challenges and HIV vulnerabilities.",

Narratives also corroborate research in Lesotho that highlights associations between stigma and sexual and mental health disparities among MSM [5, 28] and sexual health disparities among sexually diverse women [12] . Our findings suggest that stigma, and connected mental and sexual health sequalae, are shared experiences among LGBT communities at large in Lesotho. Participant narratives also point to the larger hegemonic gender norms underpinning violence targeting gender nonconformity, including homo/transphobic 'corrective' rape similarly reported in LGBT research in Eswatini [39, 40] . Compulsory heterosexuality is enforced through punishments including documented lack of human rights, violence, and social exclusion [41, 42] -reflecting sexual rights constraints among LGBT persons in Lesotho. Participants discussed how structural violence also impacted heterosexual, cisgender women in Lesotho who are blamed for sexual victimization when seeking justice, signalling larger symbolic contexts where women's sexuality is stigmatized and their sexual agency constrained.",

Similar to other research with sexually diverse women in Sub-Saharan Africa [38, 39] , participants called for HIV education to include sexually and gender diverse women-rather than solely focus on MSM. This tension is longstanding: money flows to HIV programs and can exclude persons (e.g. lesbians) with less clearly delineated HIV-related risks [43] [44] [45] . HIV funds are often the most stable funding source for LGBT agencies in LMIC, hence excluding sexually diverse women from LGBT programs could limit opportunities for them to build connections and relationships with other LGBT persons. The syndemic framework indicates that while we need funding to address HIV risks, we also need to address harmful social conditions such as sexual violence and comorbid health issues, including depression and substance use, that exacerbate HIV exposure among LGBT persons.",

This study was originally designed to explore stigma among LGBT persons in Lesotho, hence there is not a focus on overlapping health issues central to most syndemics research.

There were not enough interviews conducted with lesbian and bisexual women, MSM, and transgender persons to define differential needs and experiences within the LGBT community. For that reason, there is a need for future studies to explore shared and different experiences of stigma and interacting health issues among LGBT persons in Lesotho.",

Addressing structural violence requires advancing national LGBT human rights protection, as well as providing healthcare training and standards for LGBT affirmative care. These advocacy and institutional tactics can in turn transform social norms. Culturally tailored LGBT affirmative community-based mental health and substance use programs can be developed with LGBT persons in Lesotho to integrate local understandings of mental wellbeing and contextually appropriate adaptive coping strategies. There is an urgency to tackle LGBT mental health in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a dearth of research and efficacious interventions among general populations [46] . Even less is known about what works to promote mental health among LGBT persons. Taken together, these data suggest that interventions informed by a syndemics framework developed with and for LGBT persons in Lesotho have great potential in advancing social transformation, health and realization of human rights.",
