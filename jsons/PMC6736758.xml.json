This finding appears to be largely due to the higher proportion of VFRs among LMTs, since VFRs have been shown to travel longer than other types of travellers.27,28 This observation is a concern because the risk of infections increases with travel duration, and LMTs may not be optimally prepared if they fail to complete travel vaccine series. The greater proportion of LMTs travelling exclusively to urban areas is likely a reflection of the fact that VFR and business travellers are more likely to visit urban rather than rural areas.29,30",

Those who had previous pre-travel consults might have delayed seeking health advice because they believed they were already adequately prepared. It is also possible that travellers who had prior consults did not seek an appointment at all because they believed they were sufficiently educated about preventative measures, and this may have biased our study population towards travellers with less exposure to pre-travel health advice.
