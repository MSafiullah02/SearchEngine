Using the embedded behavioral patterns in the shared data, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) provides a solid basis for a variety of applications such as context-aware recommendation systems and health-care services [9\u201311]. To achieve better HAR performance using popular image-sharing social media such as Instagram and Yelp, various machine learning models have been presented [1\u20133].

However, its use of uni-modal textual features cannot capture enough patterns of human activities shared on the social media because users mostly describe their daily activities and thoughts using both texts and images. Such a limitation can be relieved by incorporating the inherent multi-modality of social media into the learning process as in [4, 5]. These multi-modal approaches adopt an early fusion technique which leverages concatenated features of text and image to their proposed classifiers. However, none of them has investigated applicability to HAR and it is not trivial to construct a labeled dataset which is large enough to train their multi-modal supervised methods; to the best of our knowledge, no such dataset has been published yet for multi-modal HAR using social media.",

On social media, the number of unlabeled data exponentially increases every day while only a few labeled data for a specific task exists. In such a domain, semi-supervised learning methods which leverage a small amount of labeled data and a much larger set of unlabeled data together are effective alternatives to improve learning performance [13]. To devise a semi-supervised learning method for HAR, we adopt the state-of-the-art clustering method, MultiDEC [7], which can learn deep embedded feature representations of social media image and text, respectively and extend it into a semi-supervised model which incorporates a small portion of labeled data into its training procedure. The proposed method minimizes both cross-entropy loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss. This enables the proposed model to learn more generalized feature distribution by leveraging the feature distribution of a large unlabeled dataset while optimizing the learning results to the labeled features. Evaluation results show that our method achieves 71.58% of recognition accuracy which outperforms the best accuracy of the existing HAR methods (maximum 64.15%).",

To leverage their proven effectiveness for dealing with classification tasks, a semi-supervised DEC, SSLDEC [8], has been recently presented. SSLDEC learns the target distribution of labeled data, iteratively estimates the class probability distribution of unlabeled data by measuring its feature distances from the clusters of labeled data and optimizes them during training. Thus, SSLDEC is a transductive learning method that retains recognition performance even with a relatively small amount of labeled dataset. However, the supervision mechanism of SSLDEC may fail to maximize the HAR performance when the labeled data cannot represent the target distribution correctly or its distribution cannot accommodate that of unlabeled data. Especially, when applied to social media data where such characteristics are evident, the applicability of SSLDEC may drastically decrease.",

For image preprocessing, we extract the 2048-dimensional feature representations of ResNet-50 [17] pretrained on ImageNet dataset [18]. We use this embedding method for image data because these features are known to be effective in image clustering as well as classification [19]. We compress the extracted 2048-dimensional features once again into 300-dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [20]. For text preprocessing, we split a text into separate words using a Korean tokenizer [14], and embed them onto 300-dimensions of Doc2Vec [15] Skip-gram feature space. It is verified that Doc2vec trained in a large corpora can produce robust vector representations for long text paragraphs [16].\n",

In terms of a normalized metric, macro f1 score, our proposed model performs 5.69% and 21.41% better than the text-only and image-only models. The higher NMI of our proposed model indicates that the semi-supervised multi-modal method is more effective for achieving an optimal clustering to the correct distribution than the baseline approaches. Considering that the semi-supervised uni-modal DEC performs worse than the baseline models in text-only case, we can deduce that our proposed model\u2019s achievement of the high accuracy is not attributed to the DEC component.

Since our model generalizes itself by learning the feature distribution of the unlabeled data and avoids overfitting issue, its recognition accuracy is supposed to increase as the number of unlabeled data does. We fix the number of labeled data to 12,998 (i.e., 5-fold training data) and raise the number of unlabeled data  from 0 to 951,350.\n",

Compared to the accuracy with no unlabeled data given, we achieve about 8.9% of the performance gain when we use all unlabeled data. The accuracy increases very rapidly up to 100K unlabeled data, but the improvement speed slows down when the number of unlabeled data is from 100K to 200K. This means that at least 100K to 200K unlabeled data is required to generalize the feature distribution of 12K labeled data based on our data set. Hence, we conclude that incorporation of unlabeled data into the model training is helpful to improve HAR performance and our proposed model is capable of taking the advantage effectively.",

By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, our model learns generalized feature representations and avoids being overfitted to the labeled features. Our proposed model achieves an improved HAR accuracy, compared to those of existing uni-modal approaches. In addition, we find that the incorporation of unlabeled data into the training procedure is helpful to improve HAR performance and our proposed model is capable of taking the advantage effectively.",
