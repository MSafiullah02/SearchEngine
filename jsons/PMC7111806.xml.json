To accomplish cleavage at specific sites, viruses employ one or more proteases with unique cleavage specificities. In an earlier study, we have shown that in SeMV, the processing is mediated by the N-terminal protease domain coded by ORF2 (Satheshkumar et al., 2004). It is a serine protease, similar to cellular proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin (Gorbalenya et al., 1988). The catalytic residues are H181, D216 and S284. The protease cleaves the ORF2 polyprotein at three different positions, at E325-T326, E402-T403 and E498-S499 to release four different domains\u2014protease, VPg (viral protein genome linked), p10 and RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) (Satheshkumar et al., 2004).

The serine protease domain lacking the 70 amino acids (\u0394N70-Pro) was found to be inactive in trans. However, the presence of VPg at the C-terminus of \u0394N70-Pro rendered the polyprotein active in cis and trans. By mutational analysis, it was demonstrated that interaction of W43 in the VPg domain with the protease was responsible for both cis and trans proteolytic activities and the associated conformational changes. It was suggested that the natively unfolded VPg is an activator of the protease and could regulate the polyprotein processing.",

Based on structural alignment of the S1-binding pocket with proteases of Glu/Gln specificity, H298, T279 and N308 were identified as glutamate-binding residues, and their role has been established by mutational analysis. A region of exposed aromatic residues, probably essential for interaction with the VPg domain, has been identified on the protease domain.

It was found that the solubility and the activity of the protease were enhanced by the deletion of 70 (\u0394N70-Pro) and 92 (\u0394N92-Pro) residues. The \u0394N70-Pro and \u0394N92-Pro domains of the polyprotein were cloned, expressed and purified as described earlier (Satheshkumar et al., 2004). Both \u0394N70-Pro and \u0394N92-Pro domains were crystallized using microbatch method in the presence of 0.2 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 M ammonium sulphate, 0.6 M 1,6-hexane diol, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 4% glycerol.

SeMV protease does not have any significant sequence similarity to any of the cellular or viral serine proteases.

The DALI server identifies significant similarities in the three-dimensional structures of polypeptides irrespective of the sequence similarities between them. The highest z score (17.1) was observed for the heparin-binding protein (1a7s), a serine protease homolog. The list of the top 20 structures from the DALI server output is shown in Table 2A\n. The z scores and RMSD values suggest that the SeMV protease is closer to the non-viral proteases than to the viral proteases. The structures listed in Table 2A and other viral proteases of known three-dimensional structure (Table 2B\n) were compared to the SeMV protease by pair wise alignment. The salient features of such a comparison are described below.",

In the HRV protease, the active site H40 exists in alternate conformations (Petersen et al., 1999), while in the polio viral 3C protease, the electron density for the side chain is weak, and the mean temperature factor of the atoms is above the average (Mosimann et al., 1997). The oxyanion hole, a highly conserved region of the active site in terms of sequence (GXSG) and structure, is important for the stabilization of the oxyanion intermediate formed during the reaction. In SeMV protease, the main chain amide nitrogens of G282 and S284 are involved in the oxyanion hole formation.

            "text": "Viral proteases involved in polyprotein processing are known to have very stringent substrate specificities. Mutational analyses have demonstrated that the serine protease domain of SeMV cleaves at E\u2013T occurring between protease\u2013VPg, and VPg-p10 domains, and also at E\u2013S between p10 and RdRP (Satheshkumar et al., 2004). In order to understand the structural basis of the stringent cleavage specificity of the enzyme, a comparison was carried out between SeMV protease and the structures of other proteases that display glutamate specificity (Table 2C\n). It was observed that the histidine that binds to the carbonyl oxygen of Glu/Gln is conserved in all Glu/Gln-specific proteases except the S. griseus proteases (2sga and 2sgp) where a positively charged arginine at the base of the substrate-binding pocket stabilizes the glutamate (Read et al., 1983, Read and James, 1988). The corresponding residue in SeMV protease is H298, and it is directed towards the active site. N\u03b41of H298 forms a hydrogen bond with N\u03b52 of H275 (Fig. 4A). The conformation of H275 side chain is, in turn, stabilized by a hydrogen bond from N\u03b41 to the main chain N of the disulfide-bonded C277. In the glutamate-specific S. griseus protease (1hpg), the role of the histidine triad, H213, H199 and H228 (1hpg numbering), in stabilizing the charge on glutamic acid has been emphasized (Nienaber et al., 1993). In SeMV protease, a corresponding histidine triad does not exist, and H275 hydrogen bonded to the conserved H298 is not in the same position as that of H199 in the S. griseus protease. However, the chain of hydrogen bonds is maintained. This can possibly help in the stabilization of the charge of the glutamic acid side chain.",

These aromatic residues F269, W271, Y315 and Y319 are not consecutive in sequence but form a stack near the C-terminus of the protein. Two of these residues form part of the C-terminal helix. These residues may be of functional significance to the polyprotein. SeMV residues F269 and W271 are conserved across genomes of sobemoviruses. The presence of exposed aromatic residues is believed to indicate a protein\u2013protein interaction interface. It has been demonstrated that there are extensive interactions between protease and VPg, and the conformational changes that accompany these interactions enhance and regulate protease activity (Satheshkumar et al., 2005). W43 of VPg was shown to mediate aromatic interactions with the protease, which results in a positive peak at 230 nm in the CD spectrum of protease\u2013VPg fusion protein, but the interacting partner in protease was not identified. The presence of exposed aromatic residues in the present structure strongly suggests that this might be the site of protease\u2013VPg interaction. It is probable that W271 of protease interacts with W43 of VPg domain. The positive peak observed at 230 nm in the CD spectrum of protease\u2013VPg fusion protein might be the result of this interaction. Further mutational studies are required to delineate the significance of the aromatic stretch of residues in protease activity.",

The presence of a C-terminal helix is a characteristic of many serine proteases. The disordered short segment at the C-terminus is not long enough to reach the active site suggesting the possibility of intermolecular cleavage between protease and VPg (trans-cleavage). However, it is possible that there could be a major conformational change because of the presence of the natively unfolded VPg at the C-terminus, and this may position the residues for cis-cleavage at the active site.",

The relative positions of the N-terminus and the active site suggest that an intramolecular cleavage is indeed possible. The N-terminus in the crystal structure is disordered, and clear electron density is observed only from S138. A further extension of approximately four residues is long enough to approach the active site through the cleft below the bII-cII loop of domain II. This gains additional support by the observation that the N-terminus of SeMV protease superposes very well with the glutamyl endopeptidase from Bacillus intermedius (1p3c), as shown in Fig. 7\n. In the case of 1p3c, the N-terminus extends to the active site, and this extension is essential for zymogen activation and charge compensation for glutamate specificity (Meijers et al., 2004). Therefore, based on the relative positions of the N- and C-termini and the active site in the crystal structure, it can be concluded that the cleavage between protease and VPg could occur in cis or trans, while the N-terminal cleavage could be cis.",

The residues Ala and Val are small and could be accommodated in the active site without steric hindrance. These observations also suggest that the specificity of the protease depends not only on sequence but also on the conformation of the polypeptide. A non-specific cleavage on the polypeptide chain has been observed at the C-terminus of TEV protease also (Nunn et al., 2005). There have also been reports in the literature on other viral proteases such as rhinovirus HRV2-2A protease, where the specificity requirements for cis-cleavage are less stringent than for trans-cleavage. The entropy term for substrate binding is favorable in cis-cleavage, and hence, the specificity requirements are less stringent (Petersen et al., 1999). In spite of this, most viral proteases are extremely specific, and they function mainly in the processing of the respective polyproteins. Their activities are modulated by the presence of VPg domains either at the N- or C-terminus. Determination of the structure of the protease with the VPg domain could shed light on the molecular mechanism of such regulations.",

The fractional coordinates of all the sites, their occupancies and anomalous occupancies were refined in MLPHARE for all the derivatives to a resolution of 2.8 \u00c5. The B-factors of the sites were not refined and were fixed at the values obtained from the Wilson plots. The space group was confirmed to be P3121, as this choice resulted in an interpretable map with the correct handedness.",

This resulted in the placement of 34 residues with side chains and 123 without side chains into the electron density map. The coordinates of the partial model and the phases from RESOLVE were used as input for ARP/wARP version 6.1 (Morris et al., 2003) for building the rest of the model. 80% of the residues were built by the program, which included residues 140\u2013161, 174\u2013194, 205\u2013250, 257\u2013303 and 306\u2013323. The rest of the residues were built manually in subsequent cycles of refinement using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and REFMAC 5.2 (Murshudov et al., 1997). The progress of the refinement was monitored by using 5% (459) of the total 9272 independent reflection measurements for the calculation of the free R-factor. The Hendrickson\u2013Lattman coefficients were used as restraints during the refinement (Skubak et al., 2004). Individual B-factors of non-hydrogen atoms were refined.",
