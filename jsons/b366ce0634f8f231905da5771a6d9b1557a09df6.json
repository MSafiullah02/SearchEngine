The effectiveness of these regulations was predicted by most epidemic models [2] based on the hypothesis that individual-to-individual contact is the main transmission process driving infection spreading (see [3] for a review). Their strong corroboration by the observations lead to conclude that local population density in the proximity of an individual has a strong a-priori predictive power on the likeliness of that individual to get infected.",

The proposed system enforces privacy-by-design and allows privacy levels to be externally and transparently regulated through the use of an innovative anonymizing algorithm specifically designed for mapping applications and inspired by quantum information de-localizing processes. This tool relies on GSM, not bluetooth sensing. Contrary to many other systems being developed that are based on direct proximity sensing via Bluetooth, and subsequent notifications in case of proximity with a subsequently identified infected individual, this scheme relies on determining the average local area person density via GSM/UMTS/LTE. It is meant to enable a winwin reduction of pandemic diffusion risks linked to people movements by supporting their autonomous risk prevention evaluations and decisions with the knowledge of real-time population density and fluxes. Furthermore, it would allow social distancing to be adapted to a variety of contexts, providing valuable quasi real-time information to individuals and policy-makers in taking decisions (both at the individual and strategic levels) based on a clear view of people density, which has proved so far one of the most reliable a-priori predictors of infection spreading. Finally, in the long-term, it could be a driver of innovation and economic activity, for instance as a tool for accurate flux and market analyses and business cases identification.",

Indeed, the importance of accurately geo-locating emergency phone calls was recognized to be so socially impacting already that it was made part of the LTE network standard: as of 2020, 70 % of emergency calls in the United States are positionally located within 50 m [8] .

Each cell is uniquely identified by its Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), Location Area Code (LAC) and Cell Identification number (CID). It's worth summarizing, for the following discussions, how these databases are constructed. They are built upon big datasets of geo-tagged mobile connections to individual cells of the networks from physical people mobile phones participating in the mapping initiatives, logging and streaming their anonymous GPS positions and connected network cells identification numbers while moving. Each set of mobile phones' logged GPS positions is then clustered on a per-cell basis, from which the centroid position is calculated by averaging all samples' positions. Cell connection ranges are also estimated by the spatial spread of each cluster points. The number of samples available per cell is widely distributed due to this statistical acquisition modality, spanning from the < 10 samples of infrequently visited cells up to the > 10000 samples of most frequently visited cells (Fig. 1, top row) . Ranges are similarly widely distributed, spanning from a few m to 100 km (Fig. 1, bottom row) . We applied a data quality cut to the dataset rejecting all these cells with < 8 samples, giving rise to an nonphysical tail in the ranges distribution < 50 m (Fig. 1, dashed lines) . It is worth noting also that, despite the notable dimensions of these location databases, their statistical acquisition modality can give rise to systematic errors when comparing different contexts. A first issue is spatial nonuniformity in sampling/partial territorial coverage. This issue was mitigated analyzing territories with comparable amounts of acquired samples per unit surface (given in the databases). A second concern is the completeness of the databases for small or local mobile network providers in terms of actual active cells on the territory. For this reason, the analyses reported here are given separately per network provider and limiting to those with major shares of physical-people Sim cards in Italy: TIM, Vodafone and Wind Tre, covering 30.0 %, 27.2 % and 24.7 % market respectively [11] .",

Connection domains are here defined as those surface domains in whose boundaries single mobile devices can connect with a certain probability to that particular network cell. Constructing connection domains associated to each cell thus implies accounting for the typical behaviour of mobile network devices to connect to their closest cell, when any is available, starting from the cell positions p i and ranges r i and evaluating any point in the surface. Solving this problem in the general case is a genuine challenge, suggesting the use of a Monte-Carlo approach. Here we adopted an approximated approach valid in the high network cell density limit. In this regime, cell inter-distances are much smaller than the maximum connection ranges allowed by the technology and observed ranges are set almost entirely by the transceiver positions p i (thus neglecting r i ). Also, it implies that the surface is completely covered by connection domains, forming a tessellation set by p i . This type of arbitrary tessellations constructed upon a set of generating points p i are usually known as Voronoi tessellations [13] .",

Indeed, the location method implemented in the platform combined measured signal strengths from serving transceiver stations, their neighboring ones and from each mobile device to triangulate their locations every \u223c 0.5 s, in a similar way to what OTDOA does in the case of LTE networks. A spatial resolution of 163 m was obtained in Rome's urban area with the available GSM network, increasing to 295 m in the suburbs and to 1235 m in the extra-urban area [12] . More recent experiments adopting time difference of arrival localization algorithms have also shown to be able to break the 50 m barrier in an urban context using GSM only [16] . Scaling the LocHNESs method resolution obtained in Rome by the GSM cells sizes in the different territories by these of Rome (see Fig. 6 ) allows to calculate the estimated resolution \u03c3 B GSM of GSM in a realistic scenario B. The estimate of GSM resolution in a realistic scenario A (cell identity only) was obtained with the same method used for LTE, i.e. by considering the estimates in [14] to define \u03c3 A GSM \u2248 1.6 \u00b7 r GSM . A summary of the obtained positioning resolutions for the different contexts is given in Tab. II. Results in scenario B are comparable between GSM and LTE after being scaled by their different cell sizes, further suggesting that resolution is mostly set by geometrical disposition of the cells on the territory rather than technology-specific location protocols implementations.

Another possibility for the CI approach to reach the \u223c 10 m resolutions would be to complement mobile location data with higher resolution local data sources, such as public WiFi hotspots, public means of transportation locations, smart mobility devices locations, RF-noise lev-els monitoring tools. As these networks are much less homogeneous than mobile network between different urban contexts, calibration of the reconstructed density maps with mobile network devices would likely be necessary anyway.

All wave packets are summed up in a collective wave-function \u03c8(x) = N n=1 \u03c8 (n) (x), which is then sampled over the M points p (m) of the regular grid chosen for mapping (here m \u2208 [1, M ]) to build the aggregated complexvalued map \u03c8 (m) \u2261 \u03c8(p (m) ). \u03c8 (m) takes the name of unmatched wavefunction since its phase reference is still arbitrary. It is no longer possible to reconstruct the original positions x 0 (n) from \u03c8 (m) to better than \u03c3 (n) , as each of the individual wave-functions are centered on the Gaussianlyrandomized positions x 1 (n) . Whether this aggredated map can now be considered anonymous or not, it depends only on the choice of \u03c3 (n) rather than that of the mapping accuracy. If \u03c3 (n) coefficients in the anonymization step are chosen so that many individuals' wave-packets overlap with each other, combinatorial anonymization is again provided (see next sections) while surpassing the limitation of loosing information of anonymization by thresholding. This process thus allows constructing aggregated, anonymized complex-valued unmached wavefunctions from H localization system providers, \u03c8 3. Common-phase matching: the third step (see Fig. 8 .3) is run by the system collecting all individual unmatched wavefunctions \u03c8 (m) h received from the individual providers. A phase rotation exp(i\u03c6 h ) is applied to each of the unmatched wavefunction, allowing each one to be referenced to the same phase-referencing system and thus constructing phase-matched wavefunctions that can be now summed up constructively. Unmatched wavefunctions are assumed here to be built on the same previously-set mapping grid p (m) . Phase rotation coefficients allow, in other words, all individual maps to be cross-calibrated on the same positional referencing system. ",

This task can be shown to be equivalent to retrieving the exact position of a quantum particle at rest obeying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Its exact position would be found only in the limit of infinite observations, and only if the particle is at rest all the time (i.e. with null average velocity). Combining many observations over a long time of a well isolated single individual in quiet may still allow to reduce the positional uncertainty statistically down to an undesired high level of accuracy. Several approaches are being investigated to prevent this from happening by design. The simplest one is the addition of a small amount of white noise to each of the complex maps. A more sophisticated approach is to introduce some combinatorial anonymization, obtainable in this context (without any loss of information) by selecting large enough \u03c3 (n) for several wavepackets to overlap with each other in any point of the map. Here the challenge is to select the values of \u03c3 (n) following the local availability of statistics and adopting an optimal resolution-to-anonymization criterion.
