The aim of this study was to investigate associations between upper respiratory infection (URI) in pregnancy and measures of cognitive and behavioral outcomes in child offspring. Materials and methods: A longitudinal study of 534 mother-child pairs with information regarding prenatal exposures collected through an interview conducted on average one year after delivery and subsequent participation in a childhood cognitive and psychosocial assessment between the ages 5-12 years. Childhood cognition was measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Beery-Buktenica Test of Visual Motor Integration-Fifth Edition (VMI-5) and behavioral function measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teacher-report using the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Adjusted mean differences (adjMD) in outcome measures were calculated between mothers reporting the presence or absence of a URI during pregnancy. Results: URI during pregnancy was not associated with the two measures of cognition given to offspring, but was associated with modest increases in total behavioral problems reported by mothers (adjMD: 3.72; CI: 1.91-5.54) and teachers (adjMD: 2.74; CI: 0.97-4.50). We observed differences in CBCL and TRF scores based on timing of URI: infections in mid-pregnancy (lunar months 4-5) were associated with poorer scores than were infections in early pregnancy (lunar months 2-3).

Data on URI was collected retrospectively by maternal self-report up to three years after delivery, which may have resulted in misclassification of exposure if URI was not accurately reported. In the present study, 16% and 17% of mothers reported having a URI during lunar months 2-3 and 4-5, respectively, compared to 22.8% and 21.9% reported for the first trimester and second trimester, respectively among participants in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (Collier et al., 2009) . Misclassification of URI with respect to timing, duration, and symptoms is also possible. It is possible that women mistook another illness with similar symptoms (i.e. allergies) for a URI. URI is an umbrella term for infections as it included flu-like illness, sinus infections, and the common cold. Due to this limitation, we were unable to explore specific infections, nor distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. Measures of URI in late pregnancy were not available, thereby restricting our ability to explore late pregnancy infection as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental outcomes and perhaps missing an etiologic relevant period. The exposure misclassification is not expected to be differential with respect to neurodevelopmental outcomes, since such outcomes were measured after the interview. We also lacked serologic confirmation of self-reported infection as well as information on the presence of other infections during pregnancy, such as genitourinary infections. Mean differences were adjusted for confounders but it is possible that residual confounding and confounding due to lack of variables, such as underlying conditions, is possible. Our sample, while representing a range of maternal demographic characteristics, had a higher educational attainment than the general US population.
