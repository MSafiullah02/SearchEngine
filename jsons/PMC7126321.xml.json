            "text": "The tourism industry has grown rapidly over the past few decades. Due to the perishable nature of the tourism industry, the need for accurate forecasts is crucial. Both the public non-profit government sectors and the private profit companies are interested in finding an accurate forecasting technique to make operational, tactical and strategic decisions. Companies can, using the results from this forecasting technique, plan for potential tourism demand successfully and invest in tourism related facilities and equipments sufficiently, and government sectors can play a significant role in maintaining and improving tourism infrastructure. Therefore, various forecasting methods have been developed. They include exponential smoothing (Cho, 2003), ARIMA (Cho, 2003, Chu, 1998, Goh and Law, 2002, Lim and McAleer, 2002), vector autoregressive (Song and Witt, 2006, Wong et al., 2006), neural networks (Chen and Wang, 2007, Cho, 2003, Law, 2000, Law and Au, 1999), fuzzy time series (Wang, 2004, Wang and Hsu, 2008), grey model (Hsu and Wen, 1998, Wang, 2004), econometric (Hiemstra and Wong, 2002, Smeral et al., 1992, Song and Witt, 2000, Witt and Martin, 1987), regression-based model (Chan, 1993, Crouch et al., 1992, Kulendran and Witt, 2001) and genetic algorithm (Chen and Wang, 2007, Hern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez and C\u00e1ceres-Hern\u00e1ndez, 2007, Hern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez, 2004, Hurley et al., 1998). But we can not find any paper adopting an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, referred to as ANFIS (Jang, 1993), to forecast tourist arrivals. So, the purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, and we also try to compare the results with those of other models and use the ANFIS model to forecast the monthly tourist arrivals to Taiwan from the top three markets.",

This study adopted the ANFIS model to forecast the tourist arrivals to Taiwan, and compared the MAPE and APE values and statistical results of the ANFIS with those of other models. The empirical results, obtained in Section 3, by the ANFIS model yield more accurate tourist arrivals forecasting than that of the other models. Therefore, we conclude that the ANFIS model is a valid and promising alternative for forecasting tourist arrivals. From the results of Section 4, we can see that, owing to seasonal variation, the monthly tourist arrivals forecasting has larger MAPE values than the annual data and the root mean square errors become steady until a great amount of epochs.",
