The presence of parenchymal lung lesions, a requisite for the diagnosis of pneumonia, is usually based on new infiltrates on chest radiograph. 15 However, because chest radiograph is often insufficient for detecting pulmonary parenchymal lesions of pneumonia, chest CT scan can improve the diagnosis of CAP. 16, 17 At our institution, emergency physicians who saw patients with suspected pneumonia tended to confirm pneumonia to transfer them from the Emergency Department to the Internal Medicine Department. Therefore, although CT scan is usually not necessary for the diagnosis of CAP, it was used in the majority of CAP patients treated at our institution, which allowed us to determine the proportion of patients with NP. Therefore, these facts are likely to reduce the possibility that patients who underwent CT scan had more severe disease. In the present study, NP was observed in approximately 12% of the hospitalized CAP patients. Similarly, in a previous study, 136 (39%) of 351 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia underwent CT scan of the chest, and necrotizing changes in the lungs were observed in 11% (n = 15). 6 The reasons behind a microbial agent causing necrotizing changes in the lung parenchyma of one patient but not in another remain to be elucidated. 1 One possible explanation could be the differences in the general condition or immune status of the patients. In the present study, NP was demographically characterized by a higher number of males, ever-smokers and heavy drinkers, and was more commonly associated with postgastrectomy status, chronic liver disease and diabetes.
