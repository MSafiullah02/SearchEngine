It accounts for the non-uniformity in the distribution of the time between a source infector showing symptoms and a contact event which causes a recipient to become infected. In fact, [1] model the incubation and generation periods of the virus and we can use these to estimate this distribution. The distribution ends up being numerically close to the normal distribution N (\u22120.3, 2.75 2 ). We perform this analysis below. The Gaussian infectiousness factor in Equation 3 is equal to the density of this normal distribution which is scaled so that the maximum value is 1.",

The infectiousness factor corresponds to modelling the time between the source's onset of symptoms and the potential contact time when the recipient becomes infected. This is precisely the distribution of the difference between the generation period and the incubation period. In Figure 1 , we use the parameter estimates from [1] for the generation and incubation periods and generate samples for the difference. This is compared to the Gaussian N (\u00b7; \u00b5 0 , \u03c3 2 0 ). The sample distribution is not symmetric and has a heavier left tail than the Gaussian.
