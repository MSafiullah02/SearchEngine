We confirmed this finding and documented an increasing prevalence of this virus in humans among samples collected since January 2015 from geographically distant communities in Saudi Arabia. Similar to recent reports [33] , we estimate that this recombinant virus emerged sometime in mid-to-late 2014. Based on recently available sequence data from camels in Saudi Arabia, NRC-2015 (lineage 5) was predicted to have diverged between December 2013 and June 2014 [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 45, "end": 49, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 134, "end": 138, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 144, "end": 148, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 259, "end": 263, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 295, "end": 299, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 415, "end": 419, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 425, "end": 429, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 456, "end": 460, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 461, "end": 464, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 826, "end": 830, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiologic Investigation"}, {"text": "In our study, further analysis of 87 patients with laboratoryconfirmed MERS-CoV reported in February revealed 13 individuals with no recognized risks for secondary acquisition; none of these 13 reported direct camel contact, although 1 individual reported visiting a camel farm.

This is similar to the 2014 Jeddah outbreak, where 17% of investigated cases were visitors [11] . Recommendations to limit visitation in facilities with ongoing MERS-CoV transmission should be reinforced to limit these exposures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 159, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 160, "end": 164, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 165, "end": 169, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 454, "end": 458, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiologic Investigation"}, {"text": "Our investigation, which was performed as part of an emergency public health response, is subject to several limitations. First, specimens were not available for all cases during the study period, meaning that many viruses remained untyped; however, we observed no demographic differences between cases who had specimens sequenced and those who did not. Second, since its emergence in 2012, surveillance and sequencing of MERS-CoV strains has been incomplete; variations in sequence availability and documentation might have influenced the extent of persistence and geographic spread that we have determined for past circulating virus strains. Case definitions, testing practices, and testing locations have also changed during this period. Third, although we were able to obtain full genome sequences from 12 NRC-2015 samples, all of which possessed the expected recombinant signal, our sequencing was mostly limited to the spike gene alone, which poses the risk of misclassifying recombinant viruses as belonging to NRC-2015. This is illustrated in the recent study by Sabir et al [36] , which reported multiple novel recombinant viruses in camels, including recombinants between NRC-2015 (lineage 5) and other virus clades. Fourth, because of the high morbidity and mortality of MERS-CoV infection, interviews with cases were not always possible, necessitating the use of proxies. It is possible that, combined with issues of recall, the quality of the information collected varied. Of particular consideration, 11 of 13 sporadic cases were classified on the basis of interviews with proxies, and pre-illness exposures might not have been accurately recognized and reported. Fifth, some camel exposures may have gone unrecognized because of disincentives for reporting camel exposures, given their cultural and economic significance in Saudi Arabia. Sixth, given the existing evidence of association between MERS-CoV illness and pre-illness healthcare exposure or exposure to sick individuals [10, 11, 13] , our risk classification was hierarchical; that is, reported exposure to a setting where secondary acquisition was likely took precedence over reported exposure to camels. As such, we did not assess camel exposures in individuals with recognized risks for secondary acquisition. Finally, although we have attempted to link the results of our epidemiologic investigation with MERS-CoV sequences obtained from investigated cases, we cannot fully assess the possible role of virus introductions from nonhuman sources. Recent phylogeny of MERS-CoV sequences from camels in Saudi Arabia indicated that the novel recombinant subclade (referred to as NRC-2015 in our manuscript) was also predominant in camels during a period overlapping with our study [36] . As such, our detection of closely related viruses in humans might in part reflect multiple introductions from camels with similar strains. Virus introductions from other currently unidentified sources might also be factor. Virus transmission dynamics within and between human and nonhuman sources of MERS-CoV will likely influence transmission routes in ways not yet fully understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2000, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2004, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2008, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiologic Investigation"}, {"text": "This investigation describes the emergence, persistence, and widespread circulation of a novel recombinant MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.

The neighbor joining tree bootstrap value supporting NRC-2015 was low (<70%), which may reflect the recombinant character of the clade sequences (see below) or the lower number of informative sites in the spike gene. However, similar tree topologies reproducing NRC-2015 were obtained with the spike gene sequences by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, supporting this finding (data not shown). To more fully characterize NRC-2015, 17 MERS-CoV-positive samples with sufficient available volume were selected for genome sequencing, including 12 NRC-2015 sequences from different time points and 5 from outside of the subclade. Phylogenetic analysis of these full genomes with genome sequences available on GenBank reproduced NRC-2015 with high support values (Supplementary Figure 1). Mutational analysis of the 12 new NRC-2015 genomes with previously published NRC-2015 genomes obtained from human samples collected in Saudi Arabia (n = 2), Korea/China (n = 2), and Thailand (n = 1) revealed 9 unique nucleotide substitutions common to all NRC-2015 members, of which 3 were nonsynonymous, with predicted amino acid changes in the ORF1a (n = 2) and matrix (n = 1) proteins (Supplementary", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "continued.
