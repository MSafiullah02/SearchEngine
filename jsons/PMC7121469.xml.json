Drug resistance in bacteria, the appearance of life-threatening viruses, and a tremendous increase in the incidence of fungal and drug-resistant bacterial infections in the world\u2019s population, each only underscores our inadequacy to cope with these medical problems. Added to this are enormous difficulties in raising enough food on certain areas of the earth to support local human populations. Environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and spoilage of land and water also add to problems facing mankind. In addition, there is the need for bio-derived fuels to supplant the ever-growing demand for petroleum and petroleum products.",

The genetic diversity of these organisms seems to parallel that of the diversity of host plants in which they reside. Thus, the areas of the earth having the greatest plant diversity are the wet/damp equatorial regions which have been designated as hot spots (Mittermeier et al. 1999). Frequently, these areas in the developing world and scientists living and working there have an enormous advantage in being close to the source of endophytic genetics and diversity.",

Less than a handful of these plants have ever been completely studied relative to their endophytic biology. Consequently, the opportunity to find new and interesting endophytic microorganisms among myriads of plants in different settings and ecosystems is great. The processes involved in this hunt are relatively straightforward and can be quickly learned. In fact, a few American universities have a cadre of undergraduate students involved in isolating and testing endophytic microbes for their genetic and biological potential (Strobel and Strobel 2007). This approach represents an extremely useful and practical means for students to make first-hand observations and discoveries on endophytes, which enhances their excitement and fascination in doing science.",

This search is driven by the development of resistance in infectious microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, Streptococcus) to existing compounds and by the menacing presence of naturally resistant organisms. The ingress to the human population of new diseases such as AIDS and SARS requires the discovery and development of new drugs to combat them. Not only do diseases such as AIDS require drugs that target them specifically, but so do new therapies for treating ancillary infections which are a consequence of a weakened immune system. In addition, new drugs are needed to efficiently treat parasitic protozoan and nematodal infections such as malaria, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and filariasis. Malaria alone is more effective in claiming lives each year than any other single infectious agent with the exception of the AIDS virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (NIH 2001). In addition, because of safety and environmental problems, many synthetic agricultural agents have been and currently are being targeted for removal from the market, which creates a need to find alternative ways to control farm pests and pathogens. Novel natural products and the organisms that make them offer opportunities for innovation in drug and agrochemical discovery. Finally, in the past few years, microbes have been discovered that produce fuel-related compounds upon fermentation (Strobel et al. 2008). Thus, exciting possibilities exist for those who are willing to venture into the wild and unexplored territories of the world to experience the excitement and thrill of engaging in the discovery of endophytes, their biology and potential usefulness.",

Since then, people have been engaged in the discovery and application of microbial metabolites with activity against both plant and human pathogens. Furthermore, the discovery of a plethora of microbes for applications that span a broad spectrum of utility in medicine (e.g., anticancer and immunosuppressant functions), agriculture, and industry is now practical because of the development of novel and sophisticated screening processes in both medicine and agriculture.

While the symptomless nature of endophyte occupation in plant tissue has prompted focus on symbiotic or mutualistic relationships between endophytes and their hosts, the observed biodiversity of endophytes suggests they can also be aggressive saprophytes or opportunistic pathogens. Both fungi and bacteria are the most common microbes existing as endophytes. It would seem that other microbial forms most certainly exist in plants as endophytes, but no evidence for them has yet been presented, e.g., mycoplasmas and archaebacteria. The most frequently isolated endophytes are the fungi. It turns out that the vast majority of plants have not been studied for their endophytes. Thus, enormous opportunities exist for the recovery of novel fungal forms, taxa, and biotypes. It is estimated that there may be as many as one million different fungal species, yet only about 400,000 have been described (Hawksworth and Rossman 1987). As more evidence accumulates, estimates keep rising as to the actual number of fungal species. For instance, Dreyfuss and Chappela (1994) estimate there may be at least one million species of endophytic fungi alone. However, it has been demonstrated through genetic sampling (ITS rDNA sequence information) of over 100 endophytes of Amazonian plants that there were over 10% whose sequence data did not match any known fungi within a respectable level (Smith et al. 2008). This suggests that the one million species estimate may even be low since an ever so diminishingly small sample of the rainforest was studied. It seems obvious that endophytes are a rich and reliable source of genetic diversity and novel, undescribed species. Finally, in our experience, novel microbes usually have associated with them novel natural products. This fact alone helps eliminate the problems of dereplication in compound discovery.",

There is a metabolic distinction between tropical and temperate endophytes through statistical data which compares the number of bioactive natural products isolated from endophytes of tropical regions to the number of those isolated from endophytes of temperate origin (Bills et al. 2002). Not only did they find that tropical endophytes provide more active natural products than temperate endophytes, but they also noted that a significantly higher number of tropical endophytes produced a larger number of active secondary metabolites than did fungi from other tropical substrata.

Experience of the investigator can be extremely helpful in making initial guesses on microbe identity. Then microscopic observations are made on spores, mycelia, and other fruiting structures. The best images are generally those obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which provides unique and important details of the endophyte (Fig. 14.2).

The most common gene sequences entered for most organisms at the present time are selected ribosomal encoded regions of the organismal DNA. In particular, the ITS regions are conserved genetically, and as such the sequences obtained are most likely to be unique to the organism being studied. The procedures for acquiring these genetic data are very straightforward and generally involve the use of already commercially available kits and local, regional, national, or commercially available sequencing facilities.

On Petri plates, C. quercina demonstrated excellent antifungal activity against some important human fungal pathogens\u2014Candida albicans and Trichophyton spp. A unique peptide antimycotic, termed cryptocandin, was isolated and characterized from C. quercina (Strobel et al. 1999).

The bioactive compound is related to the known antimycotics, the echinocandins and the pneumocandins (Walsh 1992). As is generally true, not one but several bioactive and related compounds are produced by a microbe. Thus, other antifungal agents related to cryptocandin are also produced by C. cf. quercina.
