In these cases, ECLS, which replaces the function of the heart by a pump and the function of the lungs by an oxygenation membrane, with a control of the temperature of the circuit, is the only recommended device to provide active internal warming [1, 2]. Without any active internal warming, active external warming techniques are not used due to the risks associated with low cardiac output caused by peripheral vasodilatation. When ECLS is not available, other active internal warming techniques should be considered, such as peritoneal lavage, intravascular warming catheter and renal replacement therapy (intermittent or continuous) [2, 3].",

            "text": "Among the available ECLS devices, central or peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was the first replacement technique used in the early 1980s, with several conclusive publications on the topic. In particular, Althaus et al. reported full recovery of 3 patients after hypothermic cardio-respiratory arrest. One of the patients underwent active central warming by a central shunt, whereas the other two patients had a peripheral shunt with a femoro-femoral approach [8]. Since the early 2000s VA-ECMO has been the gold standard therapy for this indication [6, 7]. Compared to central cardio-pulmonary shunt, VA-ECMO remains a faster and easier supportive treatment to implement. Moreover, it requires less anticoagulation to function and has the ability to be maintained in place for effective support in the event of persistent cardiac instability or severe pulmonary oedema after rewarming. Ruttmann et al. demonstrated this use in a retrospective series of 59 patients with severe hypothermia with cardio-circulatory arrest at admission. Despite a high mortality rate of approximately 79% in this cohort, this high rate could be explained by failure to recover spontaneous cardiac activity during extracorporeal warming in 26 patients. The authors showed an increased in mortality in the group of patients rewarmed by the cardiopulmonary shunt without VA-ECMO. Thus, in the 33 patients with ROSC, the survival rate with a good neurological outcome was approximately 56% in patients with VA-ECMO, compared to 18% in patients with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Moreover, the authors reported 9 deaths from massive pulmonary oedema in the ECC group, while there were no deaths in the VA-ECMO group. This study shows an increased mortality rate in the ECC group supported by the multivariate analysis. Indeed, VA-ECMO support was demonstrated as an independent risk factor of survival with an odds ratio (OR) of 6,6. The mechanisms underlying this increase in mortality rate can be explained by the occurrence of severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle during rewarming and by ischemia-reperfusion injury. VA-ECMO, by giving the opportunity to provide prolonged hemodynamic support, could prevent this acute failure [9]. The results of this study and the others discussed below are presented in Table 2.\n",

In this group, the researchers decided to only consider bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest patients, especially during the initial mobilization. This made it possible to eliminate patients already in cardiac arrest at the initial management, and for whom it is difficult to know whether the cardiac arrest is induced by the profound hypothermia or due to a hypoxic cause, which makes the global prognosis poorer.

Based on a retrospective analysis of 286 patients in 18 publications, Pasquier et al. developed the HOPE score, which takes into account six clinico-biological variables who are age, gender, asphyxia associated, CPR duration, serum potassium level and temperature (score calculation and predicted survival use an algorithm which is available online at: www.hypothermiascore.org). The statistical analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve for the HOPE score is more useful than kalaemia for predicting survival [12]. Saczkowski et al. published an another review screening 658 patients from 40 clinical cases and 44 retrospective cohorts. The survival rate was approximately 46%, with a good neurological outcome rate of 87,5% among the survivors (CPC 1 or 2). Three independent risk factors were identified in these cohorts: the initial hyperkalaemia and previous asphyxia before cardiac arrest were related to poor prognosis, whereas female sex was related to better prognosis. On the basis of these three variables, they defined the ICE score to determinate a survival with good neurological prognosis, which ranges from 85 to 0% in this model. Correlated to an area under the ROC curve of 0,849 [13]. Components of these two scores are presented in Table 4. Limiting factors for HOPE and ICE scores exist, as there has not yet been external validation, and potential publication bias is possible.\n",

However, the lactate level was high, and the pH was below 7, which did not prevent good clinical and neurological outcomes. HOPE and ICE scores were not available when we managed our patient but if we calculated them, the HOPE score resulted in 59% survival, and the ICE score was 0 (0 point for male sex, 0 point for no associated asphyxia and 0 point for the initial serum potassium concentration less than 5 mmol/l), corresponding to a probability of survival with a good neurological outcome of 60% [12, 13]. These results, similar for the two predictive scores, raise the question of their usefulness in clinical practice. Indeed, is there any existing survival score that can help us predict when to proceed to a prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO? The dilemma is then to counterbalance the predicted low survival rate against the cost of VA-ECMO implementation, and therefore, assess life-limit on a strictly economic basis. On the other hand, is there still an indication to implement such an expensive technique even if predictive scores show low survival rates under 60 or 70%? These questions raise moral and economic questions and will require a reflection process, but first we need studies to approve these survival scores, and also to confirm the place of VA-ECMO in deep hypothermia. The development of new ECMO circuits that are easy to install and start will also be important in the years to come in order to make this technique more accessible and less expensive. Nevertheless, patients, after that ECMO is implanted, should be managed by an ICU expert team of a referral hospital [25].",
