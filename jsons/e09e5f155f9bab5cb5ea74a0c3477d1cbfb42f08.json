We conducted daily transcriptomic profiling of three COVID-19 cases and found that the early immune response in COVID-19 patients is highly dynamic. Patient throat swabs were tested daily for SARS-CoV-2, with the virus persisting for 3 to 4 weeks in all three patients. Cytokine analyses of whole blood revealed increased cytokine expression in the single most severe case. However, most inflammatory gene expression peaked after respiratory function nadir, except expression in the IL1 pathway. Parallel analyses of CD4 and CD8 expression suggested that the pro-inflammatory response may be intertwined with T cell activation that could exacerbate disease or prolong the infection. Collectively, these findings hint at the possibility that IL1 and related pro-inflammatory pathways may be prognostic and serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19. This work may also guide future studies to illuminate COVID-19 pathogenesis and develop host-directed therapies.",

With autochthonous transmission in many countries, there is a high possibility that SARS-CoV-2 will become entrenched in humans. This possibility is now accentuated by large number of COVID-19 cases in which the source of transmission could not be traced. Until an effective vaccine is available to prevent infection and transmission, understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to devise therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and the overall $2% mortality rate is thus urgently needed.",

Inflammation is thought to underpin severe COVID-19, as laboratory in-vestigations have also found elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) in severe COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020) . These findings bear resemblance to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)caused by the SARS CoV, another closely related coronavirus-where cytokine storm and other dysregulated immune responses have been associated with disease pathogenesis (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . While efforts are now focused on identifying antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, calls have been made to explore host-directed approaches to reduce the inflammatory response that is associated with severe COVID-19 (Zumla et al., 2020) . However, the inflammatory response is dynamic and can fluctuate extensively from one day to another. Whether such dynamism is important to COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unknown; all studies thus far have analyzed blood collected over a range of time points from illness onset and combined into one phase of illness. If indeed the inflammatory and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dynamic, time from illness onset will need to be accurately controlled for informative analysis.",

We profiled the transcriptional changes in a panel of immune genes in three COVID-19 patients and ten healthy volunteers. We found a highly dynamic expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Expression of most of these genes peaked after the nadir of respiratory function, which calls into question the cytokine storm hypothesis. Instead, our data hints at the possibility that the IL1 pathway may be a more suitable correlate of severe respiratory disease. In addition, the attenuated cytokine expression associated with mild infection could also delay T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2, which prolongs infection; this suggests the possibility that afebrile and undifferentiated COVID-19 cases may drive virus spread in the community.",

Expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Case 1 (Figure 2A) , represented by cluster 4 and consisting of mostly genes driving the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammatory response as well as cytokine signaling pathways ( Figure S1 ), was notably higher than in healthy controls (Table S1 ). Expression of most of these genes peaked on day 6 of illness. This peak in pro-inflammatory gene expression thus lagged behind the nadir of respiratory function on day 5 of illness ( Figures 1C and 1D) . Indeed, cytokines such as IL2, IL6, TNF, and IFNA1/13 were either expressed within the range of healthy controls or were induced only after respiratory function nadir ( Figure S1F ). Only expression of the cytokines IL1A and IL1B preceded the nadir of respiratory function ( Figure 2B ). Correspondingly, expression of IL1 receptor (Figure 2B ) and the associated downstream signaling molecules ( Figure S1E ) was also induced before respiratory function nadir. These findings, albeit from a single subject, raise the possibility that global cytokine expression is not the cause of compromised respiratory function in COVID-19 patients. Instead, the finding of increased expression of IL1 and its associated signaling pathway suggests that COVID-19 pathogenesis may be driven by this pathway. If this is proven correct, licensed IL1 or IL1 receptor antagonists-such as canakinumab and anakinra, respectively-could potentially be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients to prevent respiratory dysfunction.",

In this cluster, mRNA of genes in the MHC class II-such as HLA-DRB1, HLA-DMA, and HLA-DMB-and T cell activation pathways-such as IL23A and CD74-were reduced in abundance in Case 1 compared to others ( Figure S1 ). Accordingly, the CD4, CD8A, and CD8B mRNA transcript levels were the lowest among all the subjects ( Figure 2C) . Curiously, the expression of genes in these same pathways in Cases 2 and 3 were comparable with healthy controls (Table S1 ). These findings raise two possible explanations: first, Case 1 has reduced activation of adaptive immune genes, which unleashed the TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory response. Indeed, an experimental study has found that reduced T cell activation potentiates TLR-mediated inflammation in a positive feedback loop (Kim et al., 2007) . Second and alternatively, increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in Case 1 could have led to recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood to sites of infection and the draining lymph nodes. That could have led to the mostly negative RT-PCR finding in the throat swabs from Case 1. In contrast, the lower pro-inflammatory responses in Cases 2 and 3 could have not only elicited mild symptoms but also led to a more attenuated T cell activation. Remarkably, Case 2 was afebrile throughout the period of isolation, and his cough resolved 10 days before SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR became negative. However, with an attenuated T cell response, SARS CoV-2 became prolonged as shown by the consistent viral RT-PCR positivity that lasted for nearly a month.

Indeed, because of the prolonged course of illness, we quickly reached the ethical limit of blood volume that could be collected. We focused on measuring RNA, as we were able to isolate total RNA from whole blood collected directly into a denaturing guanidine-based lysis buffer that would inactivate any viremia. Moreover, the use of additional methods, such as flow cytometry and ELISPOT assay, would not be pragmatic for this initial characterization of the immune response; these methods require larger blood volumes and manipulation in a suitably equipped biosafety level 3 containment laboratory. Notwithstanding the small sample size, we believe our findings can serve to guide design of more detailed studies, especially in the choice of sampling time points to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

NanoString nCounter Transcriptomic Profiling of Immune Response Whole blood was collected from study subjects and stored in Tempus blood RNA tubes at \u00c080 C. RNA isolation from whole blood was performed using the Tempus Spin RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions, eluted in 90 mL and stored at \u00c080 C. Nanostring profiling of host response was performed using the nCounter Human Immunology v2 Panel. Total RNA (50ng) was hybridized to reporter and capture probe sets at 65 C for 24 h. Hybridized samples were loaded on the nCounter cartridge and post-hybridization steps and scanning was performed on the nCounter Sprint Profiler. RCC files were analyzed using nSolver analysis software (Version 4.0) as per the manufacturer's protocols. Negative and positive controls included in probe sets were used for background thresholding, and normalizing samples for differences in hybridization or sample input respectively. Healthy controls consisted of participants of a measles, mumps and rubella re-vaccination study",
