The emerging virus has resulted in a global pandemic declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) Director\u2010General on the recommendation of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee.\n1\n The case detection rate is changing daily and can be tracked in almost real time.\n2\n As of 31 March 2020, 19:50 hours (Central Standard Time), the number of confirmed cases was 857 487 and reported deaths were 42 106 with 169 418 recovered patients.\n2\n The first case of a dentist being tested positive for COVID\u201019 was reported on 23 January 2020 at the Department of Preventive Dentistry in the Wuhan University Dental Hospital. Eventually, the transmission of disease to eight other oral healthcare professionals was identified.\n3\n The characteristics of epidemiological spread and clinical manifestations of COVID\u201019 in children have not yet been thoroughly elucidated. This article reports current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID\u201019 and emphasises the importance of following locally, regionally, and nationally relevant safety measures to protect dental care professionals as well as the child patient, whilst providing clinical care for the obviously affected children and those potential carriers of the infection. We emphasise that, in a rapidly changing pandemic landscape, practitioners must actively, regularly seek and use reputable and reliable sources of information on managing child patients that are appropriate for their own region and circumstances.",

To date, 3092 paediatric cases have been reported to have tested positive, and 1412 children were suspected of having been infected with COVID\u201019. A survey of 1391 children in China found 171 (12.3%) cases tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n8\n An analysis of more than 2000 child patients with suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 in Hubei, China, found that over 90% presented as asymptomatic or with mild to moderate symptoms.\n9\n A summary of paediatric cases reported with COVID\u201019 is presented in Table 1.\n7\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n, \n45\n These numbers are likely to be under\u2010representative, as there is not universal testing of the whole population for the presence of COVID\u201019.

All the above applies to child patients during the acute phase of COVID\u201019 pandemic, and the treatment choices and planning may vary during the next phases. Countries have put different measures in place for the overall delivery of dental care even during the \u2018Widespread Human Infection\u2019 phases of the pandemic leading up to the peaks of infection. These vary from those where dental practices remain open but there are screening activities and additional cross\u2010infection measures. These measures generally seem to fit for countries who managed to contain the disease spread quite quickly as seen in Singapore, for example where isolation and testing were put in place within a very short space of the infection being suspected as being present in the country.\n60\n At the other end of the spectrum, some countries have closed all dental practices. Some, such as the UK, have all cases triaged by telephone and attending only for very basic treatment in designated centres. In Brazil, The National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) has recommended that only emergency and urgent dental care should be performed (from 20 March 2020), and all private offices have to stop elective treatments. Dental professionals (primary and secondary care) that work for the National Health Service (SUS) have been allocated to help other health professionals in the fast\u2010track for COVID\u201019.\n61\n Between these two examples, there are a myriad of service delivery models.",

There are some differences between recently published documents on urgent non\u2010emergency, and emergency dental procedures by the American Dental Association,\n64\n and the UK Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Practice guidelines.\n65\n The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry has also produced an algorithm specific to managing children with emergency dental conditions.\n66\n, \n67\n As yet, it is difficult to give standard recommendations regarding personal protective equipment (PPE). The use of N\u201095 respirator masks in the United States and use of filtering facepiece respirator (FFP) masks in Europe are strongly indicated in managing children but this is not a universal recommendation across all countries.\n68\n The evidence is lacking for mask use in some areas.\n69\n The recommendations provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other local guidelines that may supersede these should be strictly followed when placing on and removing personal protective equipment used for treating children infected by COVID\u201019.\n58\n\n",

During this COVID\u201019 pandemic, universal infection control procedures are of utmost importance with extreme vigilance and championing required by all.

It must also be appreciated that pandemic experience and staging will differ geographically. Once practice restrictions begin to be eased, continued management of dental disease with contemporary dentistry through minimally interventive concepts and other non\u2010AGPs, whilst viral transmission risk remains high, will be pertinent. These include atraumatic restorative treatment,\n70\n sealing in carious lesions using fissure sealants,\n71\n silver diamine fluoride,\n72\n selective caries removal,\n73\n and the Hall Technique.\n74\n The importance of toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste to prevent tooth decay developing should continue to be emphasised during contact with patients, and there are opportunities being taken for dentists to carry out telephone and video consultations with parents to promote positive oral health behaviours.",

Dentists who treat children during this pandemic should enact universal infection control procedures to the highest standard and champion this behaviour through their teams.
