            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to understand its pathogenicity, antigenic potential and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 translated open reading frames (ORF)s in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suit of ribosome profiling techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral ORFs and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. Finally, we detected a prominent initiation at a CUG codon located in the 5'UTR. Although this codon is shared by all SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, the initiation was specific to the genomic RNA, indicating that the genomic RNA harbors unique features that may affect ribosome engagement. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome, providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic efforts.",

In addition, the presence of the annotated ORF10 was put into question (Kim et al., 2020; Taiaroa et al., 2020) . The full annotation of the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs is a prerequisite for the understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of this virus and for efficient development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.",

We found a high correlation between RNA levels and translation of most of the canonical ORFs. Moreover, we characterized 23 novel ORFs including upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a role in regulating viral gene expression and out of frame internal ORFs (iORFs) that generate novel polypeptides as well as extensions and truncations of the known ORFs. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts.

            "text": "To capture the full complexity of SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity, we applied a suit of ribosome profiling approaches to Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020 EPI_ISL_406862) for 5 or 24 hours ( Figure 1A ). For each time point we mapped genome-wide translation events by preparing three different ribosomeprofiling libraries (Ribo-seq), each one in two biological replicates. Two Ribo-seq libraries facilitate mapping of translation initiation sites, by treating cells with lactimidomycin (LTM) or harringtonine (Harr), two drugs with distinct mechanisms that inhibit translation initiation by preventing 80S ribosomes formed at translation initiation sites from elongating. These treatments lead to strong accumulation of ribosomes precisely at the sites of translation initiation and depletion of ribosomes over the body of the message [ Figure 1A and (Finkel et al., 2020; Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012) ]. The third Ribo-seq library was prepared from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), and gives a snap-shot of actively translating ribosomes across the body of the translated ORF ( Figure 1A ). In parallel, we used a tailored RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) protocol. When analyzing the different Ribo-seq libraries across coding regions in cellular genes, the expected distinct profiles are observed, confirming the overall quality of the libraries. Ribosome footprints displayed a strong peak at the translation initiation site, which, as expected, is more pronounced in the Harr and LTM libraries, while the CHX library also exhibited a distribution of ribosomes across the entire coding region up to the stop codon, and its mapped footprints were enriched in fragments that align to the translated frame ( Figure 1B and Figure S1 ). As expected, the RNA-seq reads were uniformly distributed across the coding regions ( Figure 1B and Figure S1 ).",

RNA levels are essentially constant across ORFs 1a and 1b, and then steadily increases towards the 3\u2032, reflecting the cumulative abundance of these sequences due to the nested transcription of subgenomic RNAs ( Figure 2A ). Increased coverage is also seen at the 5\u2032 UTR reflecting the presence of the 5\u2032 leader sequence in all subgenomic RNAs as well as the genomic RNA. Reduction in footprint density between ORF1a and ORF1b reflects the proportion of ribosomes that terminate at the ORF1a stop codon instead of frameshifting into ORF1b. By dividing the footprint density in ORF1b by the density in ORF1a we estimate frameshift efficiency is 57% +/-12%. This value is comparable to the frameshift efficiency measured based on ribosome profiling of MHV (48%-75%, Irigoyen et al., 2016) . On the molecular level this 57% frameshifting rate indicates NSP1-NSP11 are expressed 1.8 +/-0.4 times more than NSP12-NSP16 and this ratio likely relates to the stoichiometry needed to generate SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural macromolecular complexes (Plant et al., 2010) . It will be interesting to examine whether this stoichiometry changes along infection. Similarly to what was seen in MHV (Irigoyen et al., 2016) , we failed to see noticeable ribosome pausing before or at the frameshift site, but we identified several potential pausing sites within ORF1a. We also observed few additional potential pausing sites in ORF1b that were reproducible between replicates ( Figure S3 ), however these will require further characterization.",

We therefore examined whether the levels of viral gene translation correlate with the levels of the corresponding subgenomic RNAs. Since raw RNA-Seq densities represent the cumulative sum of genomic and all subgenomic RNAs, we calculated transcript abundance using two approaches: deconvolution of RNA densities, in which RNA densities of each ORF are calculated by subtracting the RNA read density of cumulative densities upstream to the ORF region; and relative abundances of RNA reads spanning leader-body junctions of each of the canonical subgenomic RNAs. ORF6 and ORF7 obtained negative values in the RNA deconvolution, probably due to their short length and inaccuracies introduced by deconvolution and PCR biases. For all other canonical ORFs there was high correlation between these two approaches (R = 0.897, Figure S4 ), and in both approaches the N transcript was the most abundant transcript, in agreement with recent studies (Davidson et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) .",

These non-canonical junctions contain either the leader combined with 3' fragments at unexpected sites in the middle of ORFs (leader-dependent noncanonical junction) or fusion between sequences that do not have similarity to the leader (leader-independent junction). We estimated the fusion frequency of these non-canonical junctions in our RNA libraries. We indeed identified many non-canonical junctions and obtained excellent agreement between our RNA-seq replicates for both canonical and non-canonical junctions, demonstrating these junctions are often generated and mostly do not correspond to random amplification artifacts ( Figure S5A , S5B and Table S1 ). The abundance of junctionspanning reads between our data and the data of Kim et al. (Kim et al., 2020) , that was generated from RNA harvested at 24 hpi, showed significant correlation (R=0.816, Figure S5C and S5D), illustrating many of these are reproducible between experimental systems. However, 111 out of the 361 most abundant leader independent junctions that were mapped by Kim et al., were not supported by any reads in our data, illustrating there are also substantial variations. When we compared the frequency of junctions between 5h and 24h time points, the leader dependent transcripts (both canonical and non-canonical) correlated well but the leader independent transcripts were increased at 24 hpi ( Figure 2C ). Recent kinetics measurements show viral particles already bud out of infected Vero cells at 8 hpi (Ogando et al., 2020) . This timedependent increase in non-canonical RNA junctions indicates that part of the leader independent RNA junctions might be associated with genomic replication. To further examine these noncanonical junctions, we also mapped the leader independent junctions in our RNA reads. We identified 5 abundant junctions (Table S2) , and remarkably two of these junctions represent short deletions in the spike protein (7aa and 10aa long) that overlap deletions that were recently described by other groups (Davidson et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Ogando et al., 2020) , in which the furin-like cleavage site is deleted ( Figure 2D ). The re-occurrence of the same deletion strongly supports the conclusion that this deletion is being selected for during passage in Vero cells and has clear implications for the use of Vero cells for propagating viruses (Davidson et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Ogando et al., 2020) . Another abundant junction we identified represents a potential 8aa deletion in ORF-E. Overall, this data suggests that at least part of the leaderindependent junctions may represent genomic deletions and that some of these deletions could be specifically selected for during cell culture passages.",

            "text": "Our ribosome profiling approach facilitates unbiased assessment of the full range of SARS-CoV-2 translation products. Examination of SARS-CoV-2 translation as reflected by the diverse ribosome footprint libraries, revealed several unannotated novel ORFs. We detected in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated product. These included relatively long truncated versions of canonical ORFs, such as the one found in ORF6 ( Figure 3A and Figure S6A ), or very short truncated ORFs that likely serve an upstream ORF (uORF), like truncated ORF7a that might regulate ORF7b translation ( Figure 3B , Figure S6B and Figure S6C ). We also detected internal out-of-frame translations, that would yield novel polypeptides, such as novel ORFs within ORF-N (97aa, Figure 3C and Figure S6D ) and ORF-S (39aa, Figure 3D and Figure S6E ) or short ORFs that likely serve as uORFs ( Figure 3E and Figure S6F ). Additionally, we observed a 13 amino acid extended ORF-M, in addition to the canonical ORF-M, which is predicted to start at the near cognate codon AUA ( Figure 3F and Figure S6G and Figure S6H ). Finally, we detected four distinct initiation sites at SARS-CoV-2 5'UTR. Three of these encode for uORFs that are located just upstream of ORF1a; the first initiating at an AUG (uORF1) and the other two at a near cognate codon (uORF2 and extended uORF2, Figure 3G and Figure S6I ). The forth site is the most prominent peak in the ribosome profiling densities on the SARS-CoV-2 genome and is located on a CUG codon at position 59, just 10 nucleotides upstream the TRS-leader ( Figure 3H and Figure S6J ). The reads mapped to this site have a tight length distribution characteristic of true ribosome protected fragments ( Figure S7A ). Due to its location upstream of the leader, footprints mapping to this site have the potential to be derived from all subgenomic RNAs as well as the genomic transcripts. We therefore analyzed the footprint distribution on genomic RNA and subgenomic junctions by analyzing footprint alignment to the different junctions. Surprisingly, even though the subgenomic RNAs compose the majority of transcripts, 99.5% of footprints that mapped to the CUG codon do not contain a junction and therefore originate from the genomic RNA ( Figure   S7B ). On the genome, this initiation results in an extension of uORF1 ( Figure 3H ) but it is noteworthy that the occupancy at the CUG is much higher than the downstream translation signal, suggesting this peak might reflect a pause of the ribosome on the genomic RNA. Since translation starts at the 5'-cap and both genomic and subgenomic RNAs contain an identical 5' end, including this initiation site, the specificity of the CUG initiation to the genomic RNA indicates that the genomic RNA is somehow identified or engaged differently by the ribosomes.",

The internal ORFs we identified within ORF-N ( Figure 3C ) are homologues of the annotated SARS-CoV ORF9b which was shown to suppress the host antiviral response (Shi et al., 2014 , 72% similarity in amino acids). Recent proteomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells also detected this protein (Bojkova et al., 2020) , supporting the conclusion that this is a bona fide SARS-CoV-2 protein.",

Since many of the novel ORFs we identified overlap canonical ORFs, the quantification was based on the non-overlapping regions.

To quantify the expression of out-of-frame internal ORFs we computed the contribution of the internal ORF to the frame periodicity signal relative to the expected contribution of the main ORF. For in-frame internal ORF quantification, we subtracted the coverage of the main ORF in the non-overlapping region. These calculations provide an estimate for the expression of most viral ORFs ( Figure 4C and Table S4) , and indicate that many of the novel ORFs we have annotated are expressed in high levels that are comparable to the canonical ORFs.",

            "text": "The ribosome profiling data from 24 hpi revealed highly reproducible reads that align to SARS-CoV-2 transcripts but did not fit the expected translation profile and were globally not correlated with any sequence feature related to translation ( Figure 5A ). Importantly, these non-canonical profiles were specific for the virus as cellular transcripts presented the expected profiles, ruling out any technical issues with sample preparation ( Figure S1 and Figure S2 ). Furthermore, in contrast to the footprints that mapped to cellular genes, fragments that mapped to the viral genome at 24 hpi were generally not affected by Harr or LTM treatments ( Figure 5A and Figure   S2 ) indicating that they were likely not protected by translating ribosomes. Importantly, when initiation sites of individual canonical viral genes were examined, an enhanced signal at the start codon was still observed and this signal was indeed affected by LTM treatment (Figure 5B ), indicating there is also residual signal that reflects bona fide ribosome footprints. To further examine whether the protected fragments at 24 hpi reflect ribosome protection, we applied a fragment length organization similarity score (FLOSS) that measures the magnitude of disagreement between the footprint distribution on a given transcript and the footprints distribution on canonical CDSs (Ingolia et al., 2014) . At 5 hpi protected fragments from SARS-CoV-2 transcripts scored well in these matrices and they did not differ from well-expressed human transcripts ( Figure 5C ). However, reads from 24 hpi could be clearly distinguished from cellular annotated coding sequences ( Figure 5D ). We conclude that the majority of protected fragments from the viral genome at 24 hpi are not generated by ribosome protection. It is likely that these fragments originate from protection by the N protein that wraps the viral genome into a helical nucleocapsid (Chen et al., 2007) . This possibility is supported by the absence of such signal at 5 hpi and the specificity of the signal to the plus strand (99.7% of protected fragments at 24 hpi were mapped to the positive strand). Since the peaks we obtained were very reproducible, we examined their profiles. We identified the prominent peaks and found a consistent distance between adjacent peaks of approximately 33 bps ( Figure S10 ). We reasoned this distance might reflect some periodicity related to the packing of the genome. Motif discovery algorithms failed to find an obvious sequence that defines these protected peaks, nonetheless downstream of the peak we detected a bias in nucleotide content towards higher G+C content.",

In order to quantitatively evaluate if SARS-CoV-2 skews the translation machinery to preferentially translate viral transcripts, we compared the ratio of footprints to mRNAs for virus and host CDSs at 5 hpi and 24 hpi. Since at 24 hpi our ribosome densities were masked by a contaminant signal from non-translating genomes, for samples from this time point we used the footprints that were mapped to subgenomic RNA junctions (and therefore reflect bona fide transcripts) to estimate the true ribosome densities. At both 5 hpi and 24 hpi the virus translation efficiencies fall within the low range of most of the host genes ( Figure 6A and 6B) , indicating that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Instead, during infection viral transcripts take over the mRNA pool, probably through massive transcription coupled to host induced RNA degradation (Huang et al., 2011; Kamitani et al., 2009 ).",

When possible, read density at non-overlapping regions of ORFs was used to calculate ribosome density. For out-of-frame internal ORFs, the contribution of the internal ORF to the frame periodicity relative to the expected contribution of the main ORF was computed. The expected distribution of reads within ORFs was calculated from non-overlapping regions of all ORFs in each replicate. This was used to predict the expected frame contribution of each ORF in overlapping regions, and by using linear regression we calculated the relative translation of the main and the internal ORF. The relative contribution of the internal ORF was then multiplied by the read density in the overlapping region to obtain the expression values. For in-frame internal ORFs the coverage of the main ORF in the non-overlapping region was subtracted from the overlapping region. The most 5' area of ORFs was removed from the calculation to avoid bias from initiation peaks.

The PRICE algorithm requires annotated ORFs in order to evaluate the noise level of the detected codons, which in turn is being used to compute the p-value for ORF identification. Thus, it does not perform well on reference sequences with small numbers of annotated ORFs such as SARS-CoV-2. In order to provide a comprehensive dataset of annotated ORFs from the same experiment, reads were mapped to a fasta file containing chromosome 20 of Chlorocebus sabaeus (downloaded from ensembl: ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/chlorocebus_sabaeus/dna/) and the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Refseq NC_045512.2). A gtf file with the annotations of Chlorocebus sabaeus and SARS-CoV-2 genomes was constructed and provided as the annotation file when running PRICE. For technical reasons, the annotation of the first coding sequence (CDS) of the two CDSs in the \"ORF1ab\" gene was deleted since having two CDSs encoded from a single gene was not permitted by the PRICE. The predictions were further filtered to include only ORFs with at least 100 reads at the initiation site in the LTM samples. ORFs were then defined by extending each initiating codon to the next in-frame stop codon. Additional ORFs that were not recognized by the trained model but presented reproducible translation in manual inspection were added to the final ORF list (Table   S3 ). ORFs were manually identified as such if they had reproducible initiation peaks in the CHX libraries that were enhanced in the LTM and Harr libraries, and exhibited increased CHX signal in the correct reading-frame along the coding region.",
