Patients with malnutrition, diabetes and obesity require personalized nutrition 58 advices to improve their health during this pandemic of COVID-19 59 60 65 shown positive impact on enhancing immunity in viral infections. Vitamin A and D 66 supplementation have increased the humeral immunity of paediatric patients following 67 influenza vaccination [2]. A high dose Zinc supplementation has shown immune 68 enhancement of patients with torquetenovirus (TTV) [3]. Similarly, Selenium 69 supplementation has shown a positive response after an influenza vaccination challenge 70 [4]. In addition to micronutrients, several herbal and probiotics also have shown 71 effectiveness for treatment and prevention of viral infections [5]. Moreover, several 72 nutraceuticals and probiotics have also shown a supportive role in enhancing immune 73 responses [6, 7]. 74 Malnutrition increases mortality, morbidity and causes significant economic impact on the 75 health care systems but also the economic situation of a country influences all aspects of 76 optimal nutrition care [8]. The increased risk of mortality and morbidity caused by 77 malnutrition is a result of the increased rate of infections, as well as by delayed recovery. 78 Furthermore, infections increase the demand for several nutrients [9]. It is well-recognized 79 that nutrition is a crucial factor in modulating immune homeostasis. Protein-energy 80 malnutrition or even subclinical deficiencies of one micronutrient may impair one's 81 immune responses [10]. Recently, Calder et al. have highlighted the importance of optimal 82 nutritional status to protect against a viral infection [11] and Wu et al. have provided 83 nutritional advices to reduce damages to the lungs from coronavirus and other lung 84 infections [12]. Acknowledging both these valuable reviews, we used a systematic 85 5 searching strategy and evaluated the highest quality evidence from clinical trials for both 86 the prevention and treatment of viral diseases by means of nutritional interventions. 87 Priority has been given for supplementation of vitamins, trace-elements, nutraceuticals and 88 probiotics. 89 In the light of the current pandemic of COVID-19, we wanted to evaluate the evidence on 90 enhancing immunity in viral infections. This review mainly focuses on, influenza-like viral 91 infections; however, other studies on viral infections have also been included. Finally, 92 practical recommendations have been drawn on both preventive and therapeutic nutritional 93 interventions for COVID-19.",

Epidemiological data has linked vitamin D deficiency to 155 172 without improving antibody production, and suggested that supplementation seems to 173 direct the lymphocyte polarization toward a tolerogenic immune response [22]. Similarly 174 in another RCT, a monthly high-dose (100,000 IU/month) vitamin D supplementation 175 reduced the incidence of acute respiratory infections in older long-term care residents, in 176 comparison to a standard dose group (12,000 IU/month) [23]. It is evident that the role of 177 vitamin D supplementation on antiviral immunity against respiratory infections is likely to 178 depend on the vitamin D status of the individual. Furthermore, vitamin D has demonstrated 179 a beneficial effect in other viral infections, for example adding vitamin D to conventional 180 196 4). Vitamin C 197 Vitamin C is known as an essential antioxidant and enzymatic co-factor for many 198 physiological reactions in the body, such as hormone production, collagen synthesis and 199 immune potentiation [31]. In-vivo animal studies in mice have shown that it is an essential 200 factor for the antiviral immune responses against the influenza A virus (H3N2) through the 201 increased production of interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2, especially at the early stages of the infection [31]. 202 However, our literature search was unable to identify RCTs examining the use of vitamin 203 C for the treatment for specific viral infections.

A systematic review on 159 the role of vitamin D in the prevention of acute respiratory infections, which included 39 160 studies (4 cross-sectional studies, 8 case-control studies, 13 cohort studies and 14 clinical 161 trials), noted that observational studies predominantly reported statistically significant 162 associations between low vitamin D status and increased risk of both upper and lower 163 respiratory tract infections [20]. However, results from RCTs included in the above 164 systematic review were conflicting, possibly, reflecting heterogeneity in dosing regimens 165 and baseline vitamin D status in study populations [20]. Few RCT have been conducted 166 subsequent to the above systematic review. A study by Aglipay et al. on the effect of high-167 dose (2000 IU/day) vs. standard-dose (400 IU/day) vitamin D supplementation on viral 168 upper respiratory tract infections did not show any significant difference between the two 169 group [21]. However, only about 1/3 of the study population had vitamin D levels <30 170 ng/ml. A recent RCT on the impact of vitamin D supplementation on influenza vaccine 171 response in deficient elderly person, showed that it promotes a higher TGF\u03b2 plasma level Peg-\u03b1-2b/ribavirin therapy for treatment-na\u00efve patients with chronic HCV , a fat-soluble vitamin, is a potent antioxidant and has the ability to modulate 185 host immune functions [26]. Vitamin E deficiency is known to impairs both humoral and 186 cellular immunity [26]. However, few studies have shown that vitamin E supplementation 187 might cause harmful effects on the incidence of infectious disease. A study among 50-69 188 years old adult smokers showed that vitamin E supplementation increases the risk of 189 pneumonia [27]. Similarly, supplementation of vitamin E (200 IU/day) did not have a 190 statistically significant effect on lower respiratory tract infections in elderly nursing home 191 residents [28]. However positive effects of vitamin E have been observed in the treatment 192 of chronic hepatitis B in a small pilot RCT, where a significantly higher normalization of 193 liver enzymes and HBV-DNA negativization, was observed in the vitamin E group [29]. 194 Similar results have been observed in a RCT in the paediatric population, where vitamin E 195 treatment resulted in a higher anti-HBe seroconversion and virological response [30].",

According to our findings,336 vitamin supplementation, especially vitamin D may be beneficial in people who are either 337 deficient or insufficient. Theoretically, vitamin E is a potent antioxidant and has an ability 338 to modulate the host immune functions. However, most of studies in our review reported 339 adverse effects of vitamin E supplementation on the immune response. Similarly, evidence 340 does not support supplementation of vitamin E in cardiovascular disease and cancer 341 prevention. In fact, high-dosage of vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause 342 mortality. Similar to vitamins, several trace elements are essential for proper immune 343 functions. A disrupted zinc homeostasis affects immune cells by several mechanisms 344 leading to abnormal lymphopiesis, disturbed intercellular communication via cytokines, 345 and poor innate host defense via phagocytosis and oxidative burst [75]. Similarly selenium 346 has a complex immunological mechanism but mainly through its incorporation into 347 selenoproteins [76]. Currently nutraceuticals have received considerable interest for their 348 properties in improve general health, prevent diseases and delay ageing and increase life 349 expectancy [77]. Although cellular mechanism on immunomodulating effects of various nutraceuticals are not well understood, one of the possible mechanism is anti-oxidant and 351 anti-inflammatory activities of nutraceuticals [77]. Our review has reported several 352 beneficial nutraceuticals, however it is important to note that the efficacy and safety of 353 nutraceuticals depend on their ingredients, as well as various other factors including, 354 methods of extraction [78]. Probiotics regulate the functions of systemic and mucosal 355 immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells of the host to regulate immune function [79], 356 but not all probiotics demonstrate similar health benefits [80], therefore, probiotic 357 products should be carefully selected to get depending on the clinical situation, in order to 358 obtain the relevant beneficial effect.",

Secondly, we excluded a large quantum of research on supplementation of 373 different nutrients for patients with HIV infection. However, we believe including clinical 374 trials on HIV may dilute the well-timed message of this review, targeting respiratory infection, like COVID-19. Furthermore, quality assessment using the Jadad scale identified 376 13 studies (<30%) with a score <3 points, indicating poor methodological quality. 377 However, these were not excluded, especially since a meta-analysis was not performed for 378 pooled estimates. Furthermore, another 24 studies (>54%) had a score >3, indicating 379 acceptable/good methodological quality. Finally, although exercise is one of the lifestyle 380 changes that is known to increase immunity and reduces viral infection [85], we consider 381 reviewing the effects of exercise on immune function beyond the scope of the present 382 review. Same applies for other parameters that can alter the immune capacity, e.g. stress 383 [86]. Furthermore, a large quantum of in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies have been 384 conducted on antiviral effects of vitamins, trace elements and nutraceuticals against several 385 viral diseases including influenza virus [87, 88]. However, it is difficult to draw 386 conclusions on efficiency and safety or derive recommendations for human use from these 387 studies. Therefore, these require further exploration through well-designed human clinical 388 trials, especially considering the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Everyone including self-quarantine 396 patients is encouraged to follow food based dietary guidelines from their respective 397 national governing bodies, in addition to recommendations given below [89]. For example, 398 everyone should consume at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day and all 399 main meals should contain starchy carbohydrate preferably a wholegrain variety.Moreover, two to three portions of meat or equivalent (for vegetarians: pulses and other 401 suitable protein rich foods) should be included on a daily basis[89]. However, taking 402 multi-vitamin-mineral (MVM) supplement for a short period at least during this pandemic 403 many be beneficial, since achieving a well-balanced and varied diet is difficult due to 404 several logistics and financial difficulties during lockdowns or self-quarantine.405 Furthermore, those who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should take extra 406 precautionary care to improve their energy, protein and micronutrient levels [90]. Ideally, a 407 trained dietician or nutritionist should prescribe diet, after also taking into considering 408 socio-economic factors. In addition to protein and energy malnutrition, the presence of 409 micronutrient deficiency should be early identified and corrected by therapeutic dose of the 410 respective micronutrient. In the absence of the individual micronutrient deficiencies, every 411 malnourished should take a MVM supplement [91]. On the other hand, a patient with 412 excess body weight (BMI>25 kg.m -2 ) should lose at least 5% body weight over a period of 413 12 weeks to improve their immunity [92]. Patients with diabetes mellitus require a varied 414 and balanced diet to maintain blood glucose and enhance immune functions [93], they 415 should give priority to foods with low glycemic index, limit consumption of high fat and 416 starchy or sugary foods, and choose lean protein variety [93]. Micronutrient deficiencies 417 such as Vitamin D and B 12 are well documented in the south Asian countries [94]. 418 Micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent even in high-income countries, 419 especially among vulnerable populations such as infants, children, adolescents, during 420 pregnancy and lactation and the elderly [95]. Those who have restricted dietary habits such 421 as food allergies, vegetarian of any subtype and those who have chronic diseases are also at 422 a high risk for micronutrient deficiencies [96]. It is safe to consume MVM on a daily basis 423 to optimize nutritional needs and maintain satisfactory immune function [91]. In regards to 424 the global vitamin D deficiency especially in the population of the northern hemisphere during the winter, supplementation of vitamin D (5000IU/daily) may be effective for both 426 high risk e.g. diabetes and obese individuals, and self-quarantined individuals [97]. 427 Toxicity of vitamin D is rare and modestly high doses (2000-5000 IU/daily) can be taken 428 for years [98]. The common practice of taking high dose of vitamin C and E found to be 429 inefficient to enhance immunity except vitamin E for viral hepatitis [32, 34]. Nearly 1/5 of 430 the world's population is at risk of inadequate zinc intake [99], We may recommend the 431 supplementation of zinc (20mg/daily) for optimal immune function [11]. Similarly, 432 selenium supplementation (50\u00b5g/daily) has shown beneficial effect for enhancing 433 immunity. 434 Regarding nutraceuticals, many single and combined products have shown 435 effectiveness in enhancing immunity in viral infections including influenza. Depending on 436 the availability; many nutraceuticals can be used to enhance immunity. Among over 20 437 different products; garlic, oily fish, cranberry juices and broccoli sprouts are relatively a 438 readily available options [57, 58, 60, 64]. Probiotics have been effective for improving the 439 immunity in general and Lactobacillus varieties can be recommended to prevent influenza 440 like viral infections [70, 71]. 441 Every patient who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 must be screened for 442 malnutrition on admission using a validated nutrition screening tool (e.g. NRS-2002) 443 [100]. In addition to dietary assessment, they are all required to test for serum vitamin D 444 levels, if facilities are available, it is recommended to assess micronutrient deficiencies. 445 According to serum vitamin D levels, deficient or insufficient patients must receive 446 therapeutic doses of vitamin D according to local guidelines [98]. Other vitamin 447 deficiencies also should be treated accordingly. MVM (1xRDI) can be recommended to 448 most patients with viral infections especially those who have poor dietary intake during the 449 illness [91]. Patients receiving intensive care facilities should be treated by a critical care dietician/nutritionist. Furthermore, some patients may need oral nutrition supplement 451 (ONS) to achieve recommended calories and protein intake. Resting energy expenditure 452 increases by 10% with viral infection, which should be considered and energy intake 453 should be increased 10% during the illness [101]. Among trace elements, zinc 454 (150mg/daily) and selenium (200 \u00b5g/daily) supplementation could be beneficial to 455 improve immunity during viral infections [4, 37]. Along with proper energy and nutritional 456 intake, several nutraceuticals and Lactobacillus containing probiotics can be supplemented 457 to improve the immunity of the patients with viral infections [70, 72]. Patients with 458 diabetes have severe disease progress and higher mortality [82] therefore it is 459 recommended to provide a personalized diet with help of qualified nutritionist/dietician 460 and hospital catering system [102].

            "text": "response. A RCT including 725 institutionalized elderly patients, studying delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response, humoral response to influenza vaccine, and infectious morbidity and mortality showed that low-dose supplementation of zinc together with selenium provides an increase to the humoral response after vaccination in comparison to the control group[33]. Antibody titers after influenza vaccine were higher in groups that received trace elements alone or with vitamins, whereas the vitamins only group had significantly lower antibody titers[33]. The number of patients without respiratory tract infections during the study was higher in groups that received trace elements (zinc sulfate and selenium sulfide)[33]. However in another RCT neither daily multivitamin-mineral supplementation nor vitamin E (200 mg/day) showed a favorable effect on incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in well-nourished non-institutionalized elderly226    [34]. On the contrary, this study noted an increased severity, illness-duration, number of symptoms and restriction of activity in the group supplemented with vitamin E.A summary of RCTs on trace element supplements that are discussed below is presented inTable 2.Zinc is an essential trace element which plays an important role in growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function[35, 36]. Zinc deficiency has been associated with an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, including viral infections.Studies have shown that the zinc status of an individual is a critical factor that can influence immunity against viral infections, with zinc-deficient populations being atincreased risk of acquiring infections, such as HIV or HCV [35]. Few RCTs have 239 evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation on the immune response. A study by Acevedo-Murillo et al. among 103 children (1 month to 5 years) with pneumonia showed a statically significant clinical improvement (duration of illness, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) in the zinc supplemented group compared to placebo [37]. They also demonstrated an increase in the cytokine response in Th1 pattern (IL-2 and INF-\u03b3) only in the zinc group, with Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) being elevated or remaining high in both groups. Another RCT on oral supplementation of high-dose zinc (150 mg/day) after stem cell transplantation, demonstrated that it enhances thymic function and the output of new CD4+ na\u00efve T cells, helping to prevent the reactivation of TTV [3]. However, a study by Provincial et al. concluded that although prolonged supplementation with zinc (400 mg/day) or zinc+arginine (4 d/day) in the elderly (age 64-100 years) restores zinc plasma concentrations, it is ineffective in inducing or ameliorating the antibody response or number of CD3, CD4 or CD8 lymphocytes after influenza vaccination [38]. Selenium is another trace element that has a wide range of pleiotropic effects, ranging from antioxidant effects to anti-inflammatory properties [39]. Low selenium status has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, poor immune function, and cognitive decline, while a higher selenium concentration or selenium supplementation has shown antiviral effects [39]. This has been demonstrated in a study by Broome et al., who evaluated whether an increase in selenium intake (50-100 \u00b5g/day) improves immune function in adults with marginal selenium concentration [40]. Selenium supplementation increased plasma selenium concentrations, and lymphocyte phospholipid and cytosolic glutathione peroxidase activities, the cellular immune response was increased (increased IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines), with an earlier peak T-cell proliferation, and an increase in Thelper cells. However, humoral immune responses were unaffected [40]. Furthermore selenium supplemented subjects also showed a more rapid clearance of the poliovirus. A 12-week lasting RCT on healthy adults, with sub-optimal selenium concentration 266 (<110 ng/ml), supplemented with daily capsules of yeast enriched with selenium showed both beneficial and detrimental effects [4]. In this study the immune response to flu vaccine (immune challenge) was assessed in selenium supplemented and control groups. Selenium supplementation resulted in a dose-dependent increase in T-cell proliferation, IL-increased counts of NK cells, while DTH skin responses in the high-selenium (treatment) group were normal, suggesting that selenium supplementation blocked the induction of DTH anergy [42]. Copper plays a crucial role in immunity by participating in the development and differentiation of immune cells [43]. In-vitro studies have shown that copper demonstrates antiviral properties. For example, thujaplicin-copper chelates inhibit replication of human influenza viruses [44], while intracellular copper has been shown to regulate the influenza virus life cycle [45]. Turnlund et al. conducted a study to determine the effect of long-term high copper intake on indices of copper status, oxidant damage, and immune function [46].Their results showed that plasma ceruloplasmin activity, benzylamine oxidase, and superoxide dismutase were significantly higher when copper intake was 7.8 mg/day, in comparison to 1.6 mg/day, indicating an improvement in antioxidant status. However, the higher copper intake (7.8 mg/day) significantly reduced the percentage of circulatingneutrophils, serum IL-2R and the antibody titer against the Beijing strain of influenza [46]. Magnesium plays an important role in controlling immune function by exerting a marked influence on immunoglobulin synthesis, immune cell adherence, antibodydependent cytolysis, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) lymphocyte binding, macrophage response to lymphokines, and T helper-B cell adherence [47]. Although some in-vitro and in-vivo studies suggests that magnesium is likely to play a role in the immune response against viral infections [48], our literature search was not able to identify any RCTs that demonstrated a beneficial effect of magnesium supplementation on immunity against viral Nutraceuticals are products that claim physiological benefit or protection against a chronic disease. These products may range from isolated nutrients, herbal products, dietary supplements, genetically engineered designer foods, specific diets, and processed foods, such as cereals, soups, and beverages [49]. Some nutraceuticals have shown promising results in enhancing immune function. A very recent study by McCarty et al. reported that certain nutraceuticals may help provide relief to people infected with encapsulated RNA viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus by boosting immune responses [6]. Our study found 18 RCTs conducted on nutraceuticals as shown in Table 3 [50-67]. All the studies, except the prebiotic study, showed enhanced immune responses after the treatment [52].Probiotic supplementsProbiotics are defined as live micro-organisms that confer a health benefit to the host, including on the gastrointestinal tract, when administered in adequate amounts[68].",
