Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are by far the most popular drugs proposed for treatment and prophylaxis, appearing in 97 of the COVID-19 clinical trials registered on the NIH site. These aminoquinolines, which were discovered in 1934 and are inexpensively produced in several countries, and have well-known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The antiviral mechanisms of chloroquine are based on its capacity to increase the endosomal pH. This prevents enveloped viruses, such as those belonging to the Coronaviridae family (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), from entering and releasing their genetic material into the host cells and from replicating their envelopes. Furthermore, in severe and complicated COVID-19 cases, the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may also be of importance, as both medications can suppress the production and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) 4.",
