Their positions rely upon a set of studies and experience about outbreaks and transmission mechanisms in Africa as well as assumptions about what those studies imply about outbreaks in the US. According to this view the probability of a single infection is low and that of a major outbreak is non-existent. In a series of brief reports we will provide insight into why properties of networks of contagion that are not considered in traditional statistics suggest that risks are higher than those assumptions suggest. We begin with the difference between thin and fat tailed distributions applied to the number of infected individuals that can arise from a single one. Traditional epidemiological models consider the contagion process as described by R 0 , the average number of new infected individuals arising from a single case.",

Since the properties of transmission apply equally to Duncan's personal contacts as to healthcare workers, is it unclear, why NEJM did not write an editorial about the imposition of quarantines on them nor refer to it in the editorial that was written. An explanation of the discrepancy is of importance as it leaves the public and officials uncertain about how to interpret the inconsistency, and specifically the claim that quarantine does not reflect a valid policy option. Perhaps just as significant, public discussions [15] imply that the CDC has been advocating voluntary acceptance of home isolation that may not differ from enforced home quarantine, reflecting a legal rather than medical or scientific distinction.",

For example, public places and distances of less than three feet from others are to be avoided for individuals at high risk even without symptoms. The specification indicates enforced restrictions on travel, i.e. \"These individuals are subject to controlled movement which will be enforced by federal public health travel restrictions; travel, if allowed, should occur only by noncommercial conveyances...\" Authorities are given wide latitude to enforce higher levels of restriction based upon their judgements about exposure and likelihood of compliance with voluntary restrictions. Whether or not different levels of self or publicly imposed isolation and monitoring are considered quarantine is a matter of recently adopted terminology. The existence of various levels of risk and associated protocols manifests tradeoffs of risk versus restrictions, and levels of trust in the individuals to self monitor and report their conditions as well as self-restrict activities.",

If a certain level of risk is acceptable, so that we want the probability of a new case to be lower than a value P 0 , i.e. P r,p < P 0 , and if the risk of the individual being infected is lower in one class than another, the protocols can be relaxed allowing T p to be higher. To prevent an outbreak from growing the number of newly infected individuals only has to be less than one. Acknowledging that we want a significantly lower probability, we can take it to be much less than one, say one in 10, or even one in 100, out of \"an abundance of caution,\" and this would be enough to control an outbreak.

Still, one can infer from their statements that the possibility of individual cases is acceptable and that they are concerned only for a large outbreak, whose risk they consider to be non-existent. Under these conditions, the taking of risks might be justified, after all a public fear of Ebola is only justified if it can be the cause of widespread outbreak and not the deaths of a few individuals, of which there are many causes in society. This view has been repeated multiple times, i.e. that the public at large will not be at risk (even if there are a few cases) in the US [38, 39] . Indeed, the existence of risk is clearly acknowledged in the risk levels associated with the CDC policies. Low enough levels of risk of a person being a carrier of Ebola can be addressed by lower levels of observation and isolation. If a case arises, then the consequences must not be very severe, otherwise such a risk stratification does not make sense.",

An important aspect of any evaluation of these issues is the sensitivity of the policy conclusions to the level of uncertainty in our knowledge, i.e. a sensi-tivity analysis.

This is true whether or not the protocol is called a quarantine.

When there was one individual in Dallas that was sick, there were more than 100 potential contacts [35] , many more if we count the people contacted for being on the plane in which an infected nurse flew [36] . This does not include everyone who reported symptoms but did not have other reasons to be suspected and so were rapidly dismissed from consideration [37] . If every outbreak has only a few individuals who are sick this can work. However, if there are 100, we might have to trace 10,000 people which becomes much less practical and perhaps impossible.",

We often hear about the problem with having too few hospital beds [41] , but a key problem in urban areas of West Africa is that the main tool used by public health authorities to limit outbreaks is contact tracing. Contact tracing in a dense urban environment is much more difficult than in far rural areas or even less dense urban areas where Ebola has been present before. It becomes essentially impossible when there are many cases. Without contact tracing, it is hard if not impossible to contain an outbreak. While the contacts in Monrovia are of a higher frequency than those in rural areas, these are still poor societies. This makes people mostly connected locally to others in their neighborhood. Still, there are some ways in which they are connected more generally.",

There are also events where many people are in direct contact including conferences in which people shake hands, and groups who go social dancing. Indirect contact through body fluids (including sweat as well as urine, vomit, blood and feces) deposited on a surface by one person in a place that other people touch it is a less probable way to transmit the disease, according to the experience in Africa, but it is still considered possible [44] . There are many such indirect contacts for restaurant or cafeteria workers, and in particular places, such as public buses and trains and public toilets, many people may follow where a single person has been. Unlike the dominant kinds of contact in families in poor societies, most of these contacts take place anonymously between people who do not know each other.

But low probability does not mean no probability in this case. These scenarios are only a few of many but they illustrate the problem of having a highly heterogeneous and interconnected network. The most likely scenario is that no one will be infected by the infected doctor's travels. The most likely scenario is that even if one person is infected they will not be one of the highly connected people and will infect only a few others that they are in contact with on a daily basis and know personally. This will give time to find them and isolate them. In a world of thin tailed distributions it is enough to identify the most likely scenario and any other scenario is going to be about the same.

Indeed we have already seen such surprise in public health response in the US to Ebola, in the hospital response in Dallas and in the infections of nurses and the flight one of them took when she began to have symptoms. In the second installment of this series we will review in greater detail the uncertainty that arises because existing knowledge arose in rural West Africa, a different context from that of New York or other cities, or even rural areas of the US. One example of a relevant difference is the weather. Daily temperatures consistently reached highs in the upper 90s during the outbreak that served as the primary location of transmission analysis [17, 18] and air conditioning is not a relevant factor there.",

So if we think of this as new Ebola cases infected by a single individual, we see that the chance of larger numbers falls much faster for the thin Poisson distribution than for a fat power law distribution. In the power law case we have to identify a level of risk we care about. We see that 3 or more cases will happen 1 in 10 times, 20 or more cases 1 in 100 times, 30 or more cases 1 in 200 times. In the real world the numbers might be higher or lower, but we do not know them from the information available from previous outbreaks. In the Poisson distribution, we do not have to worry about questions like this. Having more than a few cases just would not happen, as the public health authorities have claimed.",

By that time perhaps the symptoms are so bad that they report to the hospital and someone realizes that Ebola should be tested for; at least it would be better if they do. Even so, we may have 10s of actual Ebola infections. At that point we cannot consider anybody in the entire city with fever as not being a possible Ebola exposed case. If the restaurant happens to be a popular place for travelers, say at one of the airports, we cannot treat anybody anywhere as if they are not a possible carrier. Currently we only have to treat fever as a possible symptom of Ebola if the person traveled to West Africa. This is a tiny fraction of all the cases of fever.At this point the ability to use contact tracing to control the outbreak becomes doubtful and more severe actions must be taken including changes in behavior of the public. For healthcare facilities to provide intensive care to all the infected individuals, and attention to the large number of symptomatic but not Ebola infected individuals, may require compromising normal operations. How such an outbreak would eventually be contained is unclear as the real world experience is limited or non-existent. Surely it would not be easy to do.What causes the fat tail distribution to arise in this case? How are the infection events dependent on each other? In a standard statistical treatment, we would average over all professions getting a number that is dominated by low contact workers, perhaps office workers sitting at their desk most of the day, who do not have much physical or indirect contact.In an imaginary world this would work if people switched professions every hour. Then the probability that a single person infected many others would be the same as any other and would equal the average. The reason that this is not the case is that a person does not switch profession from hour to hour. When someone has a profession that involves a lot of contact, if they are sick then there are many transmission events that are linked to each other. Thus the traditional statistical assumptions do not apply.Other, perhaps behavioral, scenarios might be considered, as in someone who is at an intermediate level of risk and self-monitoring has a few drinks (there are no restrictions on this in the CDC guidelines) and as a result acts in less responsible ways, violates guidelines for travel or proximity to others, and even might throw up perhaps just as he or she is beginning to show symptoms. Or someone becomes sick from food poisoning and throws up not because of Ebola but just as symptoms are developing.",
