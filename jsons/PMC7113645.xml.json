Newly emerging pathogens such as the avian influenza A virus H7N9 (Wu and Gao, 2013) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus, also known as HCoV-EMC) (Kuehn, 2013) are severe public health problems that cause a high case-fatality rate and widespread psychological effects on society and the economy. A simple method is required to investigate a therapeutic approach to these diseases without contacting the biohazardous virus.",

            "text": "Previous studies have completed whole genome sequences (29,751 base pairs) (Marra et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003). The data reveal SARS-CoV to be a novel coronavirus that does not belong to any of the 3 known classes of coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003). The genomes encode 23 putative proteins, including known coronavirus proteins such as replicase 1A, replicase 1B, spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid protein (Marra et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003). The S gene [nucleotide (nt) 21,492\u201325,259] encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein on the viral surface and is responsible for binding and entry into the host cells (Marra et al., 2003). The S protein can be divided into 2 functional domains: S1 and S2. The S1 domain contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) responsible for specific binding to the host receptor (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003). After binding to ACE2, conformational change of the S protein induces exposure of the S2 domain and assists the virus in fusing to the host cells (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002). Therefore, the RBD within the S1 domain is the target for development of virus-entry blocking peptides and neutralizing antibodies to prevent SARS-CoV infections. Previous studies have used various methods to investigate the potential RBD from amino acids spanning 303\u2013537 (Xiao et al., 2003), 270\u2013510 (Babcock et al., 2004), 318\u2013510 (He et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004), 485\u2013625 (Zhou et al., 2004), 261\u2013672 (Sui et al., 2004), 48\u2013358 (Chou et al., 2005), and 450\u2013650 (Zhao et al., 2005), which all span hundreds of residues. A receptor-binding motif (RBM) (residues 424\u2013494) located within the RBD has been identified based on the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein RBD (residues 306\u2013527) with the receptor ACE2 (Li et al., 2005). However, no effective therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV have been developed in humans (Jiang et al., 2013).",

Bacteria containing the expression plasmids were grown in a 2\u00d7 YT broth (1.6% trypton, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) at 37 \u00b0C. The recombinant proteins were induced by adding isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mM) to the medium after the optical density (OD) of the bacterial culture reached 1.0. The optimal induction conditions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h (S1-2/pGEX-6P-1, S1-3/pGEX-6P-1, and pGEX-2KS) and 4 h (S1-1/pGEX-6P-3).

The bacterial cells were subsequently disrupted using a French Press. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 \ng for 30 min and passed through 0.45-\u03bcm filters to remove insoluble cell components. The filtered-cell lysates were loaded into a glutathione sepharose 4B column and the flow-through was again reloaded into the column to ensure saturated binding. The proteins were eluted using an elution buffer (10 mM glutathione; 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 9.6; 1 mM PMSF; 0.7 \u03bcg/mL of pepstatin, and 1 \u03bcg/mL of leupeptin) and dialyzed with 1\u00d7 PBS containing 1 mM PMSF. Consequently, all recombinant proteins used in this study were GST tagged. The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).",

The cell-adhesion efficiency of Vero-E6 cells to S1-3 coated cover slips were approximately 1.5 to 1.7-fold higher than that on GST-coated controls (Fig. 2, Fig. 4\n). These results indicate that E. coli-derived S1-3 contains functional RBD for Vero E6 cells. In contrast, the efficiency of cell adhesion on S1-2 coated substrates is less than that of substrates coated with the control protein GST (Fig. 2A-c and B). The cell adhesion of Vero E6 on S1-3 coated substrates could be inhibited by rabbit polyclonal antibodies against S1-1 and S1-2, but cannot be inhibited by control antibodies against GST (Fig. 2A-d\u2013f and B).

            "text": "In this study, a simple, quick, and safe method was established to narrow down the RBM within the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein. Most popular methods investigating the RBD of SARS-CoV S identify fragments of SARS S protein binding to cells by using flow cytometry analysis (Babcock et al., 2004, He et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2004) and an immunofluorescence assay (Chou et al., 2005, Ho et al., 2006), or determine the binding between ACE2 protein and S protein by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Xiao et al., 2003, He et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2006). Although the cell adhesion assay developed in this study might not provide high quantitative and sensitive data that matches the flow cytometry (Babcock et al., 2004, He et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2004) and ELISA-based analyses (Xiao et al., 2003, He et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2006), the analysis only requires recombinant proteins, peptides, virus permissive cells, and an ordinary light microscope to accomplish. Consequently, expensive equipment such as the flow cytometer, fluorescence microscope, and ELISA/fluorescence microplate readers are unnecessary, and this assay can be easily conducted in general laboratories, including those in third world countries. Because cell adhesion can be easily measured using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow tetrazole] assays, this method has the potential of being developed as a high throughput screening system for small molecule inhibitors when combined with automatic and robotic systems, which are unsuitable for flow cytometry and the immunofluorescence microscope based-assay. ELISA is also available for high throughput or fast screening systems; however, the recombinant ACE2 protein may not completely present as the native form of ACE2 on the surfaces of SARS-CoV permissive cells. ELISA-based analyses are only suitable to conduct after identifying the cellular receptor, for example after identifying ACE2; however, this study demonstrated that the novel cell-adhesion approach can be conducted even before identifying the cellular receptor.",

The functional comparisons between different but related cell-adhesion proteins are difficult. For example, previously we found that even a single alanine insertion in various places around the cell-binding motif RGD (R: arginine; G: glycine; D: aspartic acid) of the snake-venom-protein rhodostomin could result a dramatically difference of cell-adhesion property. An alanine insertion at position 56 (between 56th and 57th amino acid of rhodostomin) could disrupt the cell-adhesion function of rhodostomin, while single insertions at positions 45\u201355 were not (Chang et al., 2001). Because the remaining protein backbone is unchanged in this case, these results suggest that the protein structure of rhodostomin is the key determinant of cell-adhesion function. Even though, the protein backbone may play an important role in other conditions. For example, evidences indicate that positive charge poly-amino acids such as poly-lysine can serve as a cell adhesion component (Mazia et al., 1975, Rajnicek et al., 1998, Brynda et al., 2005). In addition, net positive charge of cell-attached substratum seems to play a positive role on lamellipodia, filopodia formation, cell-adhesion and cell-growth (Rajnicek et al., 1998, Brynda et al., 2005). As a result, after analyzing the amino acid sequences of recombinant GST-S1-2 and GST proteins, which encoded by S1-2/pGEX-6P-1 and pGEX-2KS, respectively, we found that pGEX-2KS-encoded GST contains more positive-charge amino acids than S1-2/pGEXT-6P-1-encoded GST-S1-2 (GST: 13%; GST-S1-2: 10%). These phenomena, which include differences on the protein structures and positive changes, may explain the reason why cell adhesion to GST-substrates was more efficient than that of GST-S1-2-substrates. Nonetheless, further functional and structural investigations are needed to address the possibilities. Despite of this, the assay in our condition has a great resolution power (with high reproducibility and significantly) to distinguish the levels of cell adhesion when RBD-containing proteins were used. This suggests that the analysis system has great potentials on the analysis of RBD of viral proteins.",

Using 3 plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV spike S1 and S2 proteins, TW1-#18, TW1-#19, and TW1-#20, as templates, S1-1 encoding the SARS-CoV S protein 1\u2013446 amino acids and S1-2 encoding the SARS-CoV S protein 446\u2013641 amino acids was produced and amplified using PCR, using 2 primers: SS-F1-2 and SS-R4-3, and SS-F3-2 and SS-R3, respectively. The PCR products of S1-1 and S1-2 were subcloned into pGEX-6P-3 and pGEX-6P-1 to form S1-1/pGEX-6P-3 and S1-2/pGEC-6P-1. The S1-1 fragment was subcloned into S1-2/pGEX-6P-1 to form S1-3/pGEX-6P-1. Synthetic peptides GA91 (spanning 437\u2013461 amino acids of the SARS-CoV S protein), GA101 (spanning 436\u2013445 amino acids of the SARS-CoV S protein), GA107 (spanning 466\u2013475 amino acids of the SARS-CoV S protein), and GA142 (spanning 100\u2013109 amino acids of the SARS-CoV S protein) are shown in the black boxes.",

Vero E6 cells were seeded onto recombinant S protein-coated cover-slips and a binding assay was subsequently performed (A, a\u2013c). For the inhibition assay, Vero E6 cells were pre-mixed with antibodies (75 \u03bcg) and seeded onto S1-3 pre-coated cover-slips (A, d\u2013f). Cell images were captured using an inverted microscope at 100\u00d7 magnification. The adherent cells were counted from 3 randomly selected (nonoverlapping) fields of each condition. The average cell counts of adherent cells in the GST-coated groups served as controls and defined as 100%.
