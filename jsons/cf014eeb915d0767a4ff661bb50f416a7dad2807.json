Among all immune cells, T-118 lymphocytes play major antiviral roles against pathogens 50 . CD4+ T-lymphocytes increase the 119 secretion of virus-specific antibodies by stimulating T-dependent B-cells. Besides, T-120 lymphocytes can survive in the infected lungs and destroy the infecting viruses 52 , this highlights 121 the important role of T-lymphocytes in controlling the pathogenesis of coronaviruses infection. It 122 has been shown that the response of cross-reactive T-lymphocytes is vital for the reduction in 123 amounts of MERS-CoV 53 . The depletion of T-lymphocytes usually causes a decrease in the 124 pulmonary recruitment of T-lymphocytes, neutralizing antibody, and cytokine production. This 125 can cause a severe immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and late clearance of SARS-CoV diminution of T-lymphocytes could increase the period of infection and promote viral survival 59 . Increasing the aerobic capacity produces an immediate improvement in the action of T-cells. A 135 recent systematic review conducted by Gon\u00e7alves et al 6 has demonstrated that aerobic exercises 136 can produce immediate and short-term improvements in the immune response of leukocytes, T-137 lymphocytes, lymphocyte subpopulations, interleukins, and immunoglobulins. Several authors 138 have demonstrated that only a single session of aerobic exercises produces improvements in the 139 utmost immune markers, such as T-lymphocytes, leukocytes, and immunoglobulins 7-10 . Lippi et 140 al 7,8 have demonstrated that mid-distance running (21.1 km) increases the production of 141 neutrophil, leukocyte, and monocyte amounts in unprofessional runners. Lira et al 10 have shown 142 that after just 60-minutes of 5-km running, an increase in cytokine IL-6 and IL-10 occurs. Li et 143 al 9 have demonstrated that a single session of prolonged aerobic exercises can increase the 144 number of circulating leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte for up to 9 hours. A more related 145 study conducted by Gon\u00e7alves et al 11 , they investigated the protective short-term effect of 146 aerobic exercises on artificially-induced acute lung injuries in mice. They found that performing 147 low aerobic exercises for only 5-weeks produced a significant increase in the number of 148 neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissue, pulmonary elasticity and 149 resistance, TNF-alpha in lung tissue, protein leakage, plasma levels of IL-10 and IL-6, and IL-150 1beta, IL-6 and KC levels. 151 152",

            "text": ",69 investigated the effect of aerobic exercises on the humoral activity in professional athletes 184 and sportswomen. They found that C3 and C4 levels suppressed immediately after aerobic 185 exercises as compared to the pre-exercise results, while these values returned to be non-186 significant as compared to pre-exercise values after only four hours. Wolach et al 70 examined the 187 effect of aerobic exercises on complement activity in young-female gymnasts. They found high 188 contradictions in the results of complement components (C1Q, C1R, C1S, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, 189 C7, CA, and C9). These high contradictions might be raised because athletes usually participate 190 in high strenuous and repeated activities, which can lead to adverse effects (very important in preventing COVID-19s infections. Immunoglobulins 194 mainly include IgA, IgE, IgM, and IgG. The IgA and IgG are dominants immunoglobulins in the 195 mucosal secretions and they play important roles in preventing respiratory tract infections (the 196 more decrease in IgA and IgG concentrations, the more increase in upper tract infections) 12-14 . 197 The role of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the amounts of immunoglobulins has 198 been demonstrated in some studies. Karacabey et al 68 have demonstrated that performing regular moderate aerobic exercises can increase hormone release and immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM. Mohamed and Taha 15 compared the long-term effects of aerobic and anaerobic exercises on 201 the amounts of immunoglobulins in obese women. They found that unlike anaerobic exercises, 202 aerobic exercises increased the amounts of immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgG. 203 204 Another subtype of humoral immunity components is pentraxins (CRP). Pentraxins play chief 205 roles in inflammatory processes and body reactions to viral infections by stimulating the 206 complement pathway, phagocytosis, apoptosis, nitric oxide secretion, and cytokines 207 production 72 . Increasing CRP levels is a body defense mechanism against viral infections, 208 however, persistent high CRP levels can significantly speed up lung damage because high CRP 209 levels cause consequent drops in lung functions 73 . One of the main lab tests to discover COVID-210 19 is serum CRP. Patients with COVID-19 have very high levels of CRP 1,74 . Increasing the 211 aerobic capacity plays an interesting role in regulating the CRP levels by producing a short-term 212 small increase in CRP levels 16-18 to fight lung infections and a long-term decrease in CRP 213 levels 19,20 to prevent the decrease in lung functions. 214 215 The immune activity can be significantly affected by the host mood. Patients with COVID-19 216 usually have higher degrees of anxiety and depression 75 . The negative effects of anxiety and 217 depression on immunity have been demonstrated in several studies 21,76,77 . Stress plays a critical 218 role in morbidity and mortality rates in immune-based diseases 21 . The actual relationship 219 between stress and decreased immunity is not clear yet. Stress might decrease immunity by 220 altering the balance between immune cells, such as altering the balance between T-helper-1/T-helper-2. Stress can cause this alteration through its effect on increasing the amounts of serum corticosteroids and catecholamines hormones, thus a decrease in the immunity response aerobic capacity can significantly improve the mood. This might be attributed to 226 the effect of aerobic exercises on decreasing stress hormones, like corticosteroids and 227 catecholamines hormones which can rebalance T-helper-1/T-helper-2 relationship 27 . It has been 228 demonstrated that the association amid exercise duration and mood variation is non-linear and 229 just performing 10-to 30-minutes aerobic exercises is sufficient to improve the mood 22,23 . Hogan 230 et al 24 have demonstrated that biking for 15 minutes has a positive effect on both youngers and 231 elderlies with anxiety disorders. Broman-Fulks and Storey 25 have reported that walking with 232 50% of maximal heart rate or running with 60-90% of maximal heart rate for 20-minutes 233 significantly decreases the sensitivity to anxiety. Crabbe et al 26 have stated that aerobic exercises 234 for just three days significantly decreases the emotional arousal to any unpleasant stimuli. 235 Asmundson et al 78 have shown that regular mild aerobic exercises significantly decrease the performance of mild to moderate intensity aerobic exercises is beneficial in 239 increasing the function of the immune system in patients with COVID-19, the performance of 240 high intensity aerobic exercises should be avoided for those patients because of its adverse 241 effects on suppressing the function of the immune system 79 . Also, aerobic exercises should be 242 avoided in high fever because of its adverse effects on decreasing the immunity 80 . The effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving respiratory system functions 245 and preventing its illnesses in patients with COVID-19 246 COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system causing pneumonia and ARDS 81-85 . Samples 247 were taken from patients with COVID-19, in Wuhan-China, from their respiratory BAL fluid 248 indicated that COVID-19 virus presented mainly in the BAL fluid 85,86 , causing a novel 249coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) 85-88 . In these samples, patients initially presented with 250 common symptoms, like fever, cough, and pneumonia. In the later stages, there were both intra 251",

            "text": "pathological findings of COVID-19 in early stages are rare, however, Tian et 262 al 83 , reported that infected patients might show proteinaceous exudate, edema, focal reactive 263 hyperplasia of pneumocytes with sporadic inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multi-nucleated 264 giant cells. Also, some differences were detected between these patients, as a reactive alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and fibroblastic proliferation (fibroblast plugs). The most common 266 pulmonary disorders in patients with COVID-19 are pneumonia and ARDS, and they are 267 considered life-threatening disorders and need immediate interventions[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] . Also, the earliest and 268 commonest signs in patients with COVID-19 are dry cough and dyspnea[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] . Increasing the 269 aerobic capacity can significantly help in preventing and treating pulmonary infections and 270 pathological conditions 89 . The effects of aerobic exercises in pulmonary infections are more 271 preferable than breathing exercises because of their associated immune and aerobic capacity can prevent pneumonia or decrease its progression from mild to 275 severe. Baumann et al 30 have demonstrated that short periods of aerobic exercises can prevent 276 the occurrence of pneumonia and fever in patients with cancer. Williams 90 has stated that mild 277 aerobic exercise, like running and walking, is associated with a lesser risk of pneumonia, 278 respiratory diseases, and aspiration pneumonia mortality. Durigon et al 37 have reported that 279 increasing the aerobic capacity for 2-months can inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa induced lung 280 inflammation and bacterial colonization in elderly mice. Neuman et al 28 have shown that 281 increasing the aerobic capacity is very important in decreasing the occurrence of pneumonia in 282 US women . Olivo et al 29 have reported that mild aerobic exercises can produce a significant 283 anti-inflammatory effect in patients with streptococcus pneumonia, which helps in attenuating 284 pulmonary inflammation. 285 severe. Rigonato-Oliveira et al 31 have demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity inhibits 288 acute lung inflammation through decreasing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress 289 markers in mice and humans. Vieira et al 91 have reported that increasing the aerobic capacity 290increases levels of IL-10, which is an essential element in immunity against acute lung 291 inflammations and injuries. A very recent study conducted by Shi et al 32 has shown that 5-weeks 292 of mild aerobic exercises can prevent acute lung injury in mice by producing neutrophil 293 extracellular traps (NETs) inhibition, which plays a vital role in acute lung injury. NETs are 294 secreted by stimulated neutrophils and consist mainly of histones, DNA, myeloperoxidase, and 295 neutrophil elastase (NE). The extracellular web-like structures can efficiently trap attacking 296 pathogens and use highly local concentrations of anti-microbial peptides to destroy of aerobic exercises over-breathing exercise in the treatment of respiratory 300 dysfunctions that occur in patients with COVID-19 can be summarized in four mechanisms. The 301 first mechanism includes the effect of aerobic exercises as antibiotic and antimycotic 302prophylaxis. It was previously mentioned in the section of \"the effect of increasing the aerobic 303 capacity on improving the immune system functions\" that increasing the aerobic capacity 304 increases the respiratory and body immunity through a) increasing the level and function of T-305 lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes which are essential elements in the 306 body's defense against infections, b) increasing the level of immunoglobulins \"IgA, IgM, IgG\", 307 particularly IgA because of its vital role in lung infections, C) regulating C-reactive protein decrease to prevent the drop in lung functions, and d) decreasing the anxiety and depression which helps to rebalance T-helper-1/T-helper-2 and improve the immunity.311 312 The second mechanism includes the effect of aerobic exercises on restoring the elasticity of lung 313 tissues and increasing strength and endurance of respiratory muscles. Increasing the aerobic 314 capacity produces short-term effects on lung elasticity and recoil mechanism. Guimar\u00e3es et al 34 , 315 investigated the effect of 4-weeks of mild aerobic exercises on the occurrence of an artificially 316 induced emphysema in mice. They found that aerobic exercises restored normal lung mechanics 317 and flow acceleration rate through decreasing lung hyperinflation, and restoring normal lung 318 tissue elasticity and strength. Park and Han 92 examined the effect of aerobic exercises on the 319 maximum-expiratory lung capacity of older women. They found that 20-minutes of mild aerobic 320 exercises for 12 weeks improved alveoli function and increased lung elasticity. Taskin et al 93 321 studied the effect of aerobic exercises on the strength of respiratory muscles in patients with 322 ankylosing spondylitis. They found that 40-minutes of mild aerobic exercises for 12-weeks 323 significantly increased the strength of respiratory muscles, inspiratory muscle performance, and 324 maximal exercise capacity and diminished dyspnea perception. 325 326 The third mechanism includes the effect of aerobic exercises as an antioxidant to limit free 327 radical production and oxidative stress. Free radicals, like reactive oxygen species (ROS), are 328 produced throughout the usual cellular function and are considered a part of normal 329 physiological processes of all living animals. Free radicals have both beneficial and toxic effects. 330 When levels of free radicals incredibly increase and cannot gradually be handled, they stress is considered the initial point for the onset of several diseases, among them lung infections 333 and diseases 94,95 . Mild aerobic exercises can help in processing these accumulated free radicals 334 and prevent the initiation of lung infections and diseases as pneumonia and ARDS. 335 336 Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity can increase lung and body resistance to oxidative stress 337 causing an elevation in the body resistance to consequent oxidative encounters by increasing the 338 function of mitochondria and allowing better oxygenation to body and lung tissues 94,96 . Toledo et 339 al 33 investigated the effect of mild aerobic exercises performed for 24-weeks on the occurrence 340 of pulmonary diseases in mice. They measured ROS as an indicator to the initiation of lung 341 diseases. They found that mild aerobic exercises decreased ROS amounts in the BAL fluid in 342 mic, which is important to prevent or decrease the progression of pneumonia and ARDS. Cunha 343 et al 97 studied the effect of aerobic exercises on the oxidative stress produced via an 344 experimentally-induced lung injury in rats. They found that 20-minutes of mild aerobic exercises 345 were able to inhibit the increase in reactive species, NF-\u043a\u03b2/p65 immuno-content, and nitrite 346 levels. They suggested that mild aerobic exercises may have a significant role as a protector 347 against the occurrence of acute lung injuries. 348 349 The fourth mechanism includes the effect of aerobic exercises in decreasing cough in patients 350 with COVID-19. Increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease cough mainly through autonomic 351 modulation more than mucociliary clearance 39,40 . Borghi-Silva et al 40 examined the effect of 6-352 weeks of mild aerobic exercises on autonomic modulation in patients with chronic obstructive respiratory rate and an increase in the tidal volume during exercise and these changes decreased 355 in the heart rate 40,98 . Recently, Leite et al 39 conducted a study to investigate the effect of 12-356 weeks of mild aerobic exercises on the autonomic nervous system and cough in patients with 357 COPD. They found that mild aerobic exercises decreased cough and heart rate. The effect of 358 increasing the aerobic capacity on decreasing the heart rate could be beneficial in decreasing 359 dyspnea found in patients with COVID-19 40 . Thus, mild aerobic exercises could produce more 360 significant effects on decreasing both cough and dyspnea, commonly seen in patients with 361 COVID-19, than breathing exercises because they affect more the parasympathetic system 362 causing a central decrease in these two symptoms. 363 364 The effects of increasing the aerobic capacity as a protective barrier against the occurrence 365 of COVID-19 366 Increasing the aerobic capacity can significantly decrease COVID-19 risk factors in short 367 periods, sometimes this effect occurs after one session only. This section focuses mainly on the 368 immediate and short-term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on COVID-19 risk factors 369 because these risk factors can cause faster spreading and progression rates 81 . The common risk 370 factors of COVID-19 include diabetes, hypertension, aging, and heart problems 42 . 371 372 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) adversely affects many body systems 99 , including immunity 100 and 373 pulmonary systems 101 . Increasing the aerobic capacity can produce an immediate reduction in 374 blood glucose in types I and II DM. Bacchi et al 43 compared the acute effects of aerobic and resistance exercises on glucose concentrations in subjects with type II DM. They found that in contrast to resistance training, mild aerobic exercises decreased glucose concentration 377 throughout the session and for the next whole night. Yardley et al 44 compared the acute effects of 378 aerobic and resistance exercises on glucose concentrations in subjects with type-1 DM. They 379 found that 45-minutes of mild aerobic exercises decreased glucose concentrations more than 380 resistance exercises, however, this decrease quickly increased after the exercise. Yokoyama et 381 al 45 investigated the short-term effects of aerobic exercises on arterial stiffness in subjects with 382 type II DM. They found that 45-minutes of mild aerobic exercises performed for 3-weeks 383 significantly decreased arterial stiffness in both femoral and common carotid arteries, and this 384 reduction was associated with an enhancement in insulin resistance. 385 386 Increasing the aerobic capacity can produce an immediate significant reduction in higher BP 102 . 387 Charlotte et al 103 examined the immediate effects of aerobic exercises on ambulatory BP among 388 female cleaners. They found that a single session of aerobic exercises significantly decreased 389 ambulatory BP up to 25 hours post-exercise. Ciolac et al 104 investigated the acute effects of a 390 single session of aerobic exercises on BP in subjects with long-term-treated hypertension. They 391 found that a single session of aerobic exercises significantly decreased ambulatory BP. 392 Nascimento et al 105 studied the acute and chronic effects of aerobic exercises on BP in subjects 393 with resistant hypertension. They found that 8-weeks of mild aerobic exercises significantly 394 reduced BP. Guimaraes et al 106 studied the effect of short-term heated water-based training on 395 systemic BP in resistant-hypertensive patients. They found that 2-weeks of mild aerobic 396 exercises significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic BP and cardiovascular load either 397 after the exercise or during the following 24-hours. Aging significantly decreases the function of body systems, subjecting these systems to 400 malfunctions and diseases. Elderlies with COVID-19 usually have higher death rates younger 401 ones. Thus, decreasing the effect of aging on body systems might help in decreasing the high 402 death rate. Cahapman et al 46 investigated the short-term effects of mild aerobic exercises on 403 cardiovascular fitness in elderlies. They found that 6-weeks of mild aerobic exercises 404 significantly increased both VO2 max and perceived exertion rate. Francesco et al 47 investigated 405 the effect of mild aerobic exercises on heart rate recovery in elderlies. They found that 8-weeks 406 of mild aerobic exercises significantly increased peak oxygen uptake, ventilatory aerobic 407 threshold, and heart rate recovery and decreased the rate of increase in ventilation per unit of 408 carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2slope), they suggested that mild aerobic exercises can 409 produce autonomic modulation through improving the vagal/sympathetic balance in older 410 subjects. Durigon et al 37 found that 5-weeks of aerobic exercises protected older mice from the 411 occurrence of artificially-induced pneumonia. 412 413 Heart problems are usually associated with lung dysfunctions, this increases the deterioration 414 rate of lung disorders and dysfunctions (heart-lung interaction) 107-109 . Increasing the aerobic 415 capacity can produce short-term improvements in heart problems. The short-term improvements 416 in heart volumes and rates were discussed in the previous paragraph 37,46,47 . Other animal studies 417 have revealed that mild aerobic exercises produce significant improvements in heart functions. 418 Tao et al 48 examined the effect of mild aerobic exercises on preventing acute myocardial 419 infarction in mice. They found that 3-weeks of mild aerobic exercises protected mice from acute 420 myocardial infarction through improving myocardium energy metabolism and producing early adaptive alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis. Wisl\u00f8ff et al 49 investigated the short-term effects of aerobic exercises on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac muscle contractility, and Ca 2+ 423 sensitivity in mice after myocardial infarction. They found that 8-weeks of moderate aerobic 424 exercises decreased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased both cardiac contractility and summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has 429 potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19. 430 This can decrease the morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19. Also, increasing the aerobic 431 capacity of people in the lockdown period is strongly recommended to decrease risk factors of 432 COVID-19 and improve the function of immunity and respiratory systems to allow better body 433 functions against COVID-19. Thus, the performance of a routine of 10 to 30 minutes of mild to 434 moderate aerobic exercises should be followed by all people in the lockdown or patients with 435 mild pulmonary symptoms. modifies inflammatory and metabolic factors in response to acute exercise.
