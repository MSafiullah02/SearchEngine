Numerous diseases have been recognized in these species and a variety of factors are involved in disease causation, including nutrition, genetics, and climate. Infectious pathogens are a major cause of morbidity, reproductive failure and mortality in SACs leading to production losses (Moro, 1971, Fernandez Baca, 1975, Ramirez et al., 1980, Kapil et al., 2009, Sharpe et al., 2009). Among infectious agents, viruses that are prevalent in other domestic species are transmitted to llamas and alpacas (Thedford and Johnson, 1989, Mattson, 1994, Whitehead and Bedenice, 2009), however, their impact in morbidity and mortality remain unclear. Therefore, establishing causal relationships and measuring impact, are of utmost importance to implement appropriate and effective control measures.",

Enteric disease, caused by protozoa, enteric bacteria and enteric viruses, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality of SAC crias (Parre\u00f1o et al., 2004, Constantini et al., 2001, Cebra et al., 2003, Palacios et al., 2005, Whitehead and Anderson, 2006, Morales et al., 2007, Starkey et al., 2007, Twomey et al., 2012, Lopez et al., 2011, Marcoppido et al., 2011, Badaracco et al., 2013). The negative effects of enteric disease in alpaca production are significant and indicate a need for further investigation to establish more precisely roles and impact of enteric pathogens in morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea.",

The RNA mixed with equal volumes of DMSO, was heated at 97 \u00b0C for 5 min, cooled down to 4 \u00b0C and then kept in ice until the reverse transcription (RT) reaction was conducted. The RT reaction was carried out using an iScript cDNA kit, as instructed (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained 5\u00d7 reaction buffer, reverse transcriptase, random hexamers, 50\u2013100 ng of RNA template, and nuclease-free water in a 20 \u03bcl/reaction. The RT reaction was run at 25 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 42 \u00b0C for 45 min and the cDNA held at 4 \u00b0C. The cDNA was used as the template to amplify VP7 or VP6 coding genes using the Green master mix kit (Promega Madison, WI). Briefly, reactions contained Green master mix, cDNA template, and Beg 9 and End 9 (Table 1\n) as forward and reverse primer sets for VP7 coding sequence (Gouvea et al., 1990), and nuclease-free water in a 25 \u03bcl/reaction. The PCR reaction was run at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. To amplify the VP6 coding sequence, specific primers rot3 and rot5 (Table 1) (Elschner et al., 2002) were used. The amplicons separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels were visualized by ethidium bromide intercalation.

The reasons of the inconclusive P typing for the latter are not understood at this juncture as the tests were repeated several times with different samples with similar results. Nevertheless, the isolation, identification and partial molecular characterization of rotavirus in fecal samples of alpaca crias with diarrhea will be instrumental for understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and will be of significant value to establish the role of rotavirus relative to other pathogens in the diarrhea complex in alpaca crias more precisely. The finding that the rotavirus isolates appear to be type G3 is intriguing as this is a common type in humans and sequencing of the corresponding gene revealed a relatively high nucleotide homology (96%) with human rotavirus in this segment.",

Interestingly, the alpaca rotavirus isolates showed 75% homology with porcine rotavirus VP4 coding sequence and up to 96 % homology with human rotavirus VP7 coding sequence (GeneBank accession numbers KT250941 and KT250942). The sequence relatedness of the two alpaca isolates with swine and human rotaviruses suggest that these may represent novel viruses resulting from interspecies transmission that may also involve zoonotic transmission (Matthijnssens et al., 2006, Parra et al., 2008, Martella et al., 2010, Parre\u00f1o et al., 2004, O\u2019shea et al., 2014) and swine may be an important reservoir in which new virus reassortants may originate (Parra et al., 2008). However, in order to draw phylogenetic or epidemiologic conclusions will require more extensive sequencing. Thus, additional comparative genetic analysis of all segments would be indicated to establish linkages and evolutionary relationships with rotaviruses from other species dwelling in the same ecologic niche including humans as recently reported with group A giraffe and vicugna rotaviruses (O\u2019shea et al., 2014, Badaracco et al., 2013). The full or partial genome sequence analysis reported in rotaviruses recovered from these species, suggests that interspecies circulation of viruses within a particular genotype constellation is a likely transmission event (O\u2019shea et al., 2014, Badaracco et al., 2013). Further extensive sequencing and phylogenetic analysis would be required to verify whether rotaviruses recovered from other SACs or any other artiodactyls or humans within the same area of our study share such genotype constellations with the alpaca rotavirus isolates.",

However, the prevalence and relative importance of rotavirus in the diarrhea complex in alpacas remains undetermined. Thus, further investigation is required to establish the actual impact of rotaviruses in the overall morbidity and mortality of alpaca crias.",

The isolation and molecular characterization of rotavirus from alpaca crias with acute diarrhea enabled us to further understand this important pathogen which potentially will contribute to develop appropriate control and/or treatment. Two rotavirus isolates were obtained from fecal samples by inoculation into cell monolayers. The isolates were identified as rotavirus by means of a RT-PCR with specific primers for human rotavirus. During identification, bovine rotavirus A was used as a reference. The alpaca isolates were identified as group A rotaviruses by VP6-specific PCR and were designated ALRVA/K\u2019ayra/Per\u00fa/3368-10 and ALRVA/K\u2019ayra/Per\u00fa/3386-10. Molecular G and P typing, placed the former as G3/P11 and the latter as G3/P?. Sequencing of the isolates segments coding for VP4 and VP7a revealed partial homologies to swine and human rotaviruses, respectively. These findings are of significant interest and call for further investigation to establish epidemiologic and phylogenetic relationships with rotaviruses from other species dwelling in the same area including humans.",
