They have been playing a major role in treating tumor and virus either as selective inhibitors of certain obligatory enzymes for cancer or viral replication [3], or as nucleic acid chain terminators, which interrupt the replication of cancer cells or a virus [4], [5], [6]. Pyrimidine nucleosides have attracted increased attention as a result of their important physiological and biogenetic properties. Among them, nucleosides bearing cytosine as a base have been developed as potent antitumor agents, which are effective not only on leukemias and lymphomas, but also on a wide variety of solid tumors in vitro as well as in vivo\n[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].",

The deoxygenation of compound 3 was carried out with tri-n-butyltin hydride (Bu3SnH) to afford the 2\u2032-deoxynucleoside 4, in 60% yield [50], [51]. The 4\u2032,6\u2032-O-isopropylidene group of 4 was removed upon treatment with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and selective protection of the primary 6\u2032-hydroxyl group with a trityl group yielded the partially protected derivative 6, in 65% yield. Oxidation of the fluoro tritylated dideoxy precursor 6 was performed with pyridinium dichromate (PDC)/acetic anhydride (Ac2O) and afforded 4\u2032-keto form, 1-(2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro-6-O-trityl-\u03b2-d-glycero-hexopyranosyl-4-ulose)-N\n4-benzoyl cytosine (7a), in equilibrium with its hydrated analogue 7b in a 3:7 ratio, as it was clearly determined by integration of the related 1H NMR signals. It appears that the presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atom \u03b1 to the carbonyl, causes the easy hydration and gem-diol formation [52]. Finally, detritylation of 7a/b in CH2Cl2/formic acid, 1:1, led to the corresponding dideoxy carbonyl compound, 1-(2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro-\u03b2-d-glycero-hexopyranosyl-4-ulose)-N\n4-benzoyl cytosine (8a) in equilibrium with its gem-diol 8b.",

Because fluoropyrimidine treatment leads to cell cycle arrest [59], [60], other parameters, such as cell cycle distribution can also be used to predict ketonucleosides sensitivity. In order to find out, whether the mechanism of antitumor activity and/or resistance to dideoxy fluoro ketopyranonucleoside analogues was similar to the mechanism of action of 5FU, the influences on cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis were studied by BrdU-cell cycle analysis. Our results clearly showed that in Caco-2 cell line, 5FU equitoxic treatment resulted in an increase of the percentage of cells in G0/G1 and in % decrease of cells in the G2/M phase (Table 3\n, compounds 7a/b and 13a/b, Fig. 1\n). However, BrdU analysis showed that a cell cycle delay took place specifically at the G1/S interface as previously reported for 5FU (Table 3, Fig. 1) [59], [60]. Exposure of cancer cells to compounds 7a/b, 13a/b and 5FU led to a % BrdU-positive cells or labeling index (LI) increase. However, LI modifications were only related to the G1/S phase accumulation, and not to a real enhanced S-phase fraction. In fact, BrdU analysis showed that G1 cells, as determined by 7-AAD analysis, were composed of BrdU-positive and BrdU-negative cell subpopulations (Fig. 1). These subpopulations cannot be distinguished using 7-AAD analysis alone.",

During the last hour of incubation, cells were pulsed with 10 \u03bcM BrdU solution. Samples for flow cytometry were processed using FITC-BrdU flow kit including 7-AAD labeling. Representative dot-plot of treated cells, gated according to their (FSC versus SSC) scatter properties is shown. Bivariate distributions of BrdU content (FITC) versus DNA content (7-AAD) were analyzed. Cell cycle distribution in G0/G1, S, G2/M phases and % of apoptotic (sub G1) cells was determined. The G1/S subpopulation, corresponding to BrdU-positive cells containing G1 DNA, was determined. Labeling index (LI) corresponds to S phase or percentage of BrdU-positive cells.",
