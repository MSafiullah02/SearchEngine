The wearing of face masks has become usual and ubiquitous, obviously in hospitals, but also in community [3] . Even without necessarily needing them, the general public is over-consuming surgical or filtering face piece (FFP) masks irrespective of their specificity [4, 5] . This can lead to supply shortages for HCWs that are in the frontline to take care for patients, as already reported in several countries [5] .

Surgical masks must bear on their packaging: the CE marking, the dated reference of standard EN 14683, and the type of mask (type I, II, IIR). This last information characterizes the performances of bacterial filtration, differential pressure and resistance pressure to splash, according to EN14683, the last being required only for IIR masks.
