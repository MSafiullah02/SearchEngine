Disinfection is usually accomplished by the use of liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization in health care settings. The efficacy of disinfection is affected by a number of factors, each of which may nullify or limit the efficacy of the process. Some of the factors that affect both disinfection and sterilization efficacy are the prior cleaning of the object; the organic and inorganic load present; the type and level of microbial contamination; the concentration of and exposure time to the germicide; the nature of the object (e.g., crevices, hinges, and lumens); the presence of biofilms; the temperature and pH of the disinfection process; and, in some cases, the relative humidity of the sterilization process (e.g., with ETO).",

At similar concentrations but with shorter exposure periods (e.g., 12 minutes for 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde) these same disinfectants will kill all microorganisms with the exception of large numbers of bacterial spores and are called high-level disinfectants. Low-level disinfectants may kill most vegetative bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses in a practical period of time (\u226410 minutes), whereas intermediate-level disinfectants may be cidal for mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and most fungi but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores.

Thorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Also, if the soiled materials become dried or baked onto the instruments, the removal process becomes more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization process less effective or ineffective. Surgical instruments should be presoaked or rinsed to prevent drying of blood and to soften or remove blood from the instruments. Decontamination is a procedure that removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle, use, or discard.",

For example, a germicide is an agent that can kill microorganisms, particularly pathogenic organisms (\u201cgerms\u201d). The term germicide includes both antiseptics and disinfectants. Antiseptics are germicides applied to living tissue and skin, whereas disinfectants are antimicrobial agents applied only to inanimate objects. Preservatives are agents that inhibit the growth of microorganisms capable of causing biologic deterioration of substances/materials. In general, antiseptics are only used on the skin and not for surface disinfection and disinfectants are rarely used for skin antisepsis because they may cause injury to skin and other tissues. Other words with the suffix \u201c-cide\u201d (e.g., virucide, fungicide, bactericide, sporicide, and tuberculocide) can kill the type of microorganism identified by the prefix. For example, a bactericide is an agent that kills bacteria.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\n",

Most of the items in this category should be purchased in sterile form or be sterilized by steam sterilization if possible. If heat sensitive, the object may be treated with ETO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, hydrogen peroxide vapor, or liquid chemical sterilants if other methods are unsuitable. Tables 301-1\nand 301-2\nlist several germicides categorized as chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants.

Glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, and peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are dependable high-level disinfectants provided the factors influencing germicidal procedures are met (see Tables 301-1 and 301-2).

Intact skin acts as an effective barrier to most microorganisms; therefore, the sterility of items that come in contact with intact skin is \u201cnot critical.\u201d Examples of noncritical items are bedpans, blood pressure cuffs, crutches, bed rails, bedside tables, patient furniture, and floors. The five most commonly touched noncritical items in the patient environment have been quantitatively shown to be bed rails, bed surface, supply cart, overbed table, and intravenous-line pump.41 In contrast to critical and some semicritical items, most noncritical reusable items may be decontaminated where they are used and do not need to be transported to a central processing area. There is virtually no documented risk of transmitting infectious agents to patients via noncritical items36 when they are used as noncritical items and do not contact nonintact skin or mucous membranes. However, these items (e.g., bedside tables, bed rails) could potentially contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of health care workers or by contact with medical equipment that will subsequently come in contact with patients.14, 42, 43, 44, 45\nTable 301-1 lists several low-level disinfectants that may be used for noncritical items. The exposure time listed in Table 301-1 is equal to or greater than 1 minute. Many U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants have a 10-minute label claim. However, multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of these disinfectants against vegetative bacteria (e.g., Listeria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]), yeasts (e.g., Candida), mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and viruses (e.g., poliovirus) at exposure times of 30 to 60 seconds.42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 Thus, it is acceptable to disinfect noncritical medical equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuff) and noncritical surfaces (e.g., bedside table) with an EPA-registered disinfectant or disinfectant/detergent at the proper use-dilution and a contact time of at least 1 minute.9, 59 Because the typical drying time for a germicide on a surface is 1 to 3 minutes (unless the product contains alcohol [e.g., a 60% to 70% alcohol will dry in about 30 seconds]) (N. Omidbakhsh, written communication), one application of the germicide on all hand contact surfaces to be disinfected is recommended.",

Use of a disinfectant did significantly improve microbial removal when a cotton string mop was used.61 Mops (especially cotton-string mops) are commonly not kept adequately cleaned and disinfected, and if the water-disinfectant mixture is not changed regularly (e.g., after every 3 to 4 rooms, no longer than 60-minute intervals), the mopping procedure may actually spread heavy microbial contamination throughout the health care facility.62 In one study, standard laundering provided acceptable decontamination of heavily contaminated mop heads but chemical disinfection with a phenolic was less effective.62 The frequent laundering of cotton-string mops (e.g., daily) is, therefore, recommended.",

The main products of this \u201cwater\u201d are hypochlorous acid (e.g., at a concentration of about 144 mg/L) and chlorine. This is also known as electrolyzed water; and, as with any germicide, the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water is strongly affected by the concentration of the active ingredient (available free chlorine).84 The free available chlorine concentrations of different superoxidized solutions reported in the literature range from 7 to 180 ppm.84 Data have shown that freshly generated superoxidized water is rapidly effective (<2 minutes) in achieving a 5-log10 reduction of pathogenic microorganisms (i.e., M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium chelonae, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), MRSA, E. coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in the absence of organic loading.

Because hypochlorites and other germicides are substantially inactivated in the presence of blood,54, 92 large spills of blood require that the surface be cleaned before an EPA-registered disinfectant or a 1 : 10 (final concentration) solution of household bleach is applied. If there is a possibility of a sharps injury, there should be an initial decontamination,69, 93 followed by cleaning and terminal disinfection (1 : 10 final concentration).54 Extreme care should always be used to prevent percutaneous injury. At least 500 ppm available chlorine for 10 minutes is recommended for decontamination of CPR training manikins.

This emphasizes the need to ensure that semicritical equipment is disinfected with an acceptable concentration of glutaraldehyde. Data suggest that 1.0% to 1.5% glutaraldehyde is the minimal effective concentration (MEC) for 2% or greater glutaraldehyde solutions when used as a high-level disinfectant.115, 116, 117 Chemical test strips or liquid chemical monitors are available for determining whether an effective concentration of glutaraldehyde is present despite repeated use and dilution. The frequency of testing should be based on how frequently the solutions are used (e.g., used daily, test daily; used weekly, test before use), but the strips should not be used to extend the use life beyond the expiration date. Data suggest the chemicals in the test strip deteriorate with time,118 and a manufacturer's expiration date should be placed on the bottles. The bottle of test strips should be dated when opened and used for the period of time indicated on the bottle (e.g., 120 days). The results of test strip monitoring should be documented. The glutaraldehyde test kits have been preliminarily evaluated for accuracy and range,118 but their reliability has been questioned.119 The concentration should be considered unacceptable or unsafe when the test indicates a dilution below the product's MEC (generally to 1.0% to 1.5% glutaraldehyde or lower) by the indicator not changing color.",

Only 30- to 60-second contact time was studied because longer contact times (e.g., 10 minutes) are not achievable in clinical practice. Additionally, the improved hydrogen peroxide products have an EPA-registered contact time that is substantially less (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute for bacteria) than most EPA-registered low-level disinfectants.58 We have also recently shown that the 1.4% activated hydrogen peroxide is very effective in reducing microbial contamination of hospital privacy curtains. In our study, the activated hydrogen peroxide completely eliminated contamination with MRSA and VRE and resulted in a 98.5% reduction in microbes (only Bacillus spp. recoverable). Thus, at our institution, privacy curtains are being disinfected at the grab area by spraying the grab area of the curtain three times with activated hydrogen peroxide at discharge cleaning.",

It has excellent stability over a wide pH range (pH 3 to 9), is not a known irritant to the eyes and nasal passages, does not require exposure monitoring, has a barely perceptible odor, and requires no activation. OPA, like glutaraldehyde, has excellent material compatibility. A potential disadvantage of OPA is that it stains proteins gray (including unprotected skin) and thus must be handled with caution.93 However, skin staining would indicate improper handling that requires additional training and/or personal protective equipment (gloves, eye and mouth protection, fluid-resistant gowns). OPA residues remaining on inadequately water-rinsed transesophageal echocardiographic probes may leave stains on the patient's mouth. Meticulous cleaning, use of the correct OPA exposure time (e.g., 12 minutes), and copious rinsing of the probe with water should eliminate this problem. Because OPA has been associated with several episodes of anaphylaxis after cystoscopy,153 the manufacturer has modified its instructions for use of OPA and contraindicates the use of OPA as a disinfectant for reprocessing all urologic instrumentation for patients with a history of bladder cancer. Personal protective equipment should be worn when handling contaminated instruments, equipment, and chemicals.148 In addition, equipment must be thoroughly rinsed to prevent discoloration of a patient's skin or mucous membrane. The MEC of OPA is 0.3%, and that concentration is monitored by test strips designed specifically for the OPA solution. OPA exposure level monitoring found that the concentration during the disinfection process was significantly higher in the manual group (median, 1.43 ppb) than in the automatic group (median, 0.35 ppb). These findings corroborate other findings that show it is desirable to introduce automatic endoscope reprocessors to decrease disinfectant exposure levels among scope reprocessing technicians.154\n",

The term \u201cflash\u201d arose out of the abbreviated time of exposure of the unwrapped instrument. Flash sterilization is an antiquated term that does not fully describe the various steam sterilization cycles now used to process items not intended to be stored for later use. Immediate use is defined as the shortest possible time between a sterilized item's removal from the sterilizer and its aseptic transfer to the sterile field. This implies that the sterilized item is used during the procedure for which it was sterilized and in a manner that minimizes its exposure to air and other environmental contaminants. The same critical reprocessing steps (e.g., cleaning, decontamination, rinsing, and aseptic transfer from the sterilizer to the point of use) must be followed. Immediate-use steam sterilization should not be used for convenience, as an alternative to purchasing sufficient instrument sets, or as a time saver.209, 210\n",

The ETO-carbon dioxide (CO2) mixture consists of 8.5% ETO and 91.5% CO2. This mixture has limited use in U.S. health care facilities but is sometimes used in hospitals in India and China. It is less expensive than ETO-hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), but a disadvantage is the need for pressure vessels rated for steam sterilization, because higher pressures (28-psi gauge) are required. The other mixture, which is a drop-in CFC replacement, is ETO mixed with HCFC. HCFCs are approximately 50-fold less damaging to the earth's ozone layer than are CFCs. The EPA will begin regulation of HCFC in the year 2015 and will terminate production in the year 2030. The ETO-HCFC mixtures have been provided by companies as a drop-in replacement for CFC-12 (one mixture consists of 8.6% ETO and 91.4% HCFC, and the other mixture is composed of 10% ETO and 90% HCFC) but will be phased out by the end of 2013.216 An alternative to the pressurized mixed-gas ETO systems is 100% ETO. Partly because of the events just described, the 100% ETO sterilizers that use unit-dose cartridges will become the systems for ETO use in U.S. health care facilities.",

One example is the contact time used to achieve high-level disinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde. Based on FDA requirements (FDA regulates liquid sterilants and high-level disinfectants used on critical and semicritical medical devices), manufacturers test the efficacy of their germicide formulations under worst-case conditions (i.e., minimum recommended concentration of the active ingredient) and in the presence of organic soil (typically 5% serum). The soil is used to represent the organic loading to which the device is exposed during actual use and that would remain on the device in the absence of cleaning. These stringent test conditions are designed to provide a margin of safety by ensuring that the contact conditions for the germicide provide complete elimination of the test bacteria (e.g., 105 to 106 \nM. tuberculosis in organic soil and dried on a scope) if inoculated into the most difficult areas for the disinfectant to penetrate and in the absence of cleaning. However, the scientific data demonstrate that M. tuberculosis levels can be reduced by at least 8 log10 with cleaning (4 log10) followed by chemical disinfection for 20 minutes at 20\u00b0 C (4 to 6 log10).9, 37, 243 Because of these data, professional organizations (at least 14 professional organizations worldwide) that have endorsed an endoscope reprocessing guideline recommend contact conditions of 20 minutes at 20\u00b0 C (or <20 minutes outside the United States) with 2% glutaraldehyde to achieve high-level disinfection that differs from that of the manufacturer's label.37, 244, 245, 246 It is important to emphasize that the FDA tests do not include cleaning, a critical component of the disinfection process. Therefore, when cleaning has been included in the test methodology, 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes has been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating all vegetative bacteria.",

CJD is related to other human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) that include kuru (0 incidence, now eradicated), Gertsmann-Straussler-Sheinker (GSS) syndrome (1/40 million), and fatal insomnia syndrome (FFI) (<1/40 million). The agents of CJD and other TSEs exhibit an unusual resistance to conventional chemical and physical decontamination methods. Because the CJD agent is not readily inactivated by conventional disinfection and sterilization procedures and because of the invariably fatal outcome of CJD, the procedures for disinfection and sterilization of the CJD prion have been both conservative and controversial for many years.",

A moist environment after contamination reduces the attachment of both protein and prion amyloid to the stainless steel surface so moist conditions should be maintained.261 After the device is clean, it should be sterilized by either autoclaving (i.e., steam sterilization) or using a combination of sodium hydroxide and autoclaving262 using one of the options below257:Option 1\u2014autoclave at 134\u00b0 C for 18 minutes in a prevacuum sterilizerOption 2\u2014autoclave at 132\u00b0 C for 1 hour in a gravity displacement sterilizer9, 257, 263\nOption 3\u2014immerse in 1N sodium hydroxide for 1 hour; remove and rinse in water, then transfer to an open pan and autoclave (121\u00b0 C gravity displacement or 134\u00b0C porous or prevacuum sterilizer) for 1 hourOption 4\u2014immerse in 1N sodium hydroxide for 1 hour and heat in a gravity displacement at 121\u00b0 C for 30 minutes, then clean and subject to routine sterilization.Some data suggest the temperature should not exceed 134\u00b0 C because the effectiveness of autoclaving may decline as the temperature is increased (e.g., 136\u00b0 C, 138\u00b0 C).264 Prion-contaminated medical devices that are impossible or difficult to clean should be discarded. To minimize environmental contamination, noncritical environmental surfaces should be covered with plastic-backed paper; and when contaminated with high-risk tissues, the paper should be properly discarded. Noncritical environmental surfaces (e.g., laboratory surfaces) contaminated with high-risk tissues should be cleaned and then spot decontaminated with a 1 : 10 dilution of hypochlorite solutions.257\n",

Recent studies have demonstrated that adequate environment cleaning is frequently lacking. For example, Carling and co-workers assessed the thoroughness of terminal cleaning in the patient's immediate environment in 23 acute care hospitals (1119 patient rooms) by using a transparent, easily cleaned, stable solution that fluoresces when exposed to hand-held UV light.272 The overall thoroughness of cleaning, expressed as a percent of surfaces evaluated, was 49% (range for all hospitals, 35% to 81%). Using a similar design, Carling and co-workers assessed the environmental cleaning in intensive care unit rooms in 16 hospitals (2320 objects) and demonstrated that only 57.1% of sites were cleaned after discharge of the room's occupant.273 A recent study using ATP bioluminescence assays and aerobic cultures demonstrated that medical equipment frequently had not been disinfected as per protocol.274\n",

We have found that assignment of cleaning responsibility (e.g., medical equipment to be cleaned by nursing; environmental surfaces to be cleaned by environmental service) is also important to ensure all objects and surfaces are decontaminated, especially the surfaces of medical equipment (e.g., cardiac monitors). Improved environmental cleaning has been demonstrated to reduce the environ\u00admental contamination with VRE,275, 276 MRSA,276 and C. difficile.\n277 Importantly, no study has reported in the postintervention period proper cleaning of more than 85% of objects.

Mean C. difficile log10 reductions ranged from 1.8 to 2.9 using cycle times of 34.2 to 100.1 minutes. Surfaces in direct line-of-sight were significantly more likely to yield negative cultures after UV decontamination than before decontamination. Nerandzic and colleagues showed that UV-C at a reflected dose of 22,000 mWs/cm2 for approximately 45 minutes consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores and MRSA by more than 2- to 3-log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/cm2 and of VRE by more than 3- to 4-log10 CFU/cm2.282 Thus, there are now three studies that have demonstrated that a UV-C system is capable of reducing vegetative bacteria inoculated on a carrier by more than 3- to 4-log10 in 15 to 20 minutes and C. difficile by more than 1.7- to 4-log10 in 35 to 100 minutes.

There are several important differences between the two systems. The UV-C system offers faster decontamination that reduces the \u201cdown\u201d time of the room before another patient can be admitted. The hydrogen peroxide systems have been demonstrated to be more effective in eliminating spore-forming organisms. Whether this improved sporicidal activity is clinically important is unclear because studies have demonstrated that although environmental contamination is common in the rooms of patients with C. difficile infection, the level of contamination is relatively low (also true for MRSA and VRE). Finally, the hydrogen peroxide system was demonstrated to reduce C. difficile incidence in a clinical study, whereas similar studies with the UV-C system have not been published. If additional studies continue to demonstrate a benefit, then widespread adoption of these technologies should be considered for terminal room disinfection of certain patient rooms (e.g., contact precautions) in health care facilities.",

For a waste to be infectious, therefore, it must contain pathogens with sufficient virulence and quantity so that exposure to the waste by a susceptible host could result in an infectious disease. Because there are no tests that allow infectious waste to be identified objectively, responsible agencies (e.g., the CDC, EPA, or states) define waste as infectious when it is suspected to contain pathogens in sufficient number to cause disease.

Hospitalized patients generate about 15 pounds of hospital waste per day. The amount of hospital waste generated by U.S. hospitals is approximately 6700 tons per day. U.S. hospitals designate approximately 15% of the total hospital waste by weight as infectious (about 1000 tons of infectious waste per day).293 Not surprisingly, the percentage of medical waste treated as infectious increases with the number and types of medical waste classified as infectious. For example, about 6% of hospital waste would be treated as infectious waste if the CDC guidelines are followed but 45% of hospital waste could be considered infectious waste under the MWTA.293, 299\n",

For example, in September 1997 there were an estimated 2373 medical waste incinerators in the United States, but based on the EPA's 2010 inventory there are 54 infectious waste incinerators.300 Autoclaves or steam sterilizers have become the primary nonincineration technology used by hospitals to process their regulated medical waste (except pathology waste) (E. Krisiunas, written communication, 2008). Several other nonincineration alternatives have been proposed for treating regulated medical waste (e.g., mechanical/chemical disinfection, microwave decontamination, steam disinfection, and compacting).297 Nonregulated medical waste is generally discarded in a properly sited and operated sanitary landfill because this is a safe and inexpensive disposal method (e.g., landfill disposal costs $0.02 to 0.05 per pound for nonregulated medical waste versus a contract incinerator cost of $0.20 to 0.60 per pound for regulated medical waste).",

First, with the exception of \u201csharps\u201d such as needles, which have caused disease only in an occupational setting, there is no scientific evidence that medical waste has caused disease in the hospital or the community. Second, data demonstrate that household waste contains on average 100 times as many microorganisms with pathogenic potential for humans than medical waste.301 Third, detailed reports of the beach washups found that the vast majority of waste on beaches was debris (about 99%) such as wood, plastic, and paper, not medical waste. EPA documents acknowledge that much of the medical waste that washed ashore in the summer of 1988 was syringe related (65%) and came from home health care and illegal drug use. Fourth, studies have shown that most U.S. hospitals are in compliance with the CDC infectious waste guidelines. Fifth, although the principal purpose of the MWTA was to reduce medical waste on beaches, it has not demonstrated its intended benefit. The relative number of syringes on the beaches in the MWTA states was significantly greater during implementation of the Act (17.23%) than before the Act went into effect (3.2%).299 If regulatory control were based on epidemiologic, microbiologic, and environmental data, only two types of medical waste would require special handling and treatment\u2014sharps and microbiologic waste.",
