Type I IFN was identified on the basis of its functional ability to restrict viral replication. Soon after its discovery, specific types of nucleic acids were found to potently induce this key antiviral cytokine and thus mimic the presence of virus 1 . The identification of the corresponding immune sensing receptors was a pre requis ite to any real understanding of how self and nonself nucleic acids can be distinguished.",

Thus, the recognition of foreign nucleic acids among an abundance of self nucleic acids in an organism is a substantial biochemical chal lenge. There is now a broad consensus within the field that most of the receptors involved in the immune sens ing of nucleic acids have been identified. Given the sub stantial progress over the last few years, it seems timely to review the current literature and to convey an updated concept of nucleic acid sensing. First, we provide a brief overview of the general principles of nucleic acid sensing. Then, the current literature on RNA and DNA sensing is reviewed with a focus on self versus nonself recognition.",

However, in vertebrates, although there are indications that RNAi is involved in the degrada tion of genomic RNA of some viruses in some cell types (reviewed in REF. 11 ), other reports suggest that there is competition rather than cooperation between small interfering RNA (siRNA)mediated RNAi and type I IFNdominated antiviral pathways 12 (see below). Overall, RNAi does not seem to have an essential function in vertebrate antiviral defence but, if not the sequence, which biochemical and cell biological features of nucleic acids are used for the reliable discrimination of foreign and self? Availability, localization and structure. In vertebrates, the principle of self versus nonself nucleic acid sens ing is based on three central criteria (FIG. 1) : first, the availability of nucleic acid ligands as determined by their local concentration, by the rate of degradation by endogenous nucleases and by the level of shielding (for example, by nucleocapsid proteins); second, the localization of nucleic acid ligands, such as outside the cell membrane, in the endolysosomal compartment or in the cytosol; and third, the structure of nucleic acid ligands as characterized by sequence motifs, conform ation (for example, basepaired versus unpaired) and chemi cal modification. In many cases, a combination of all three aspects contributes to the reliable recognition of potentially dangerous foreign nucleic acids leading to the induction of appropriate innate immune responses.",

Since viral replication crucially relies on the host's translation machinery, most antiviral mech anisms specifically or nonspecifically target the mRNA translation process (FIG. 2) . One such receptor is PKR, which inhibits viral and host cap-dependent translation by phosphorylating eukary otic translation initiation factor 2A (eIF2A) 34 . Further antiviral functions of PKR have been postulated but are controversial. IFNinduced protein with tetratricopep tide repeats 1 (IFIT1) is an antiviral effector protein 35, 36 that binds to the 5\u2032 cap of mRNA lacking a 2\u2032Omethyl modification at the N1 position and blocks its transla tion [37] [38] [39] . IFIT1 has been proposed to compete with eIF4E (TLR3) and TLR7, whereas single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8. These receptors signal via myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF) to induce interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-IRF7 and type I IFN production and via nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to induce pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) and the inflammasome component NLRP3. The helicases retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) detect dsRNA in the cytosol and signal through mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) to induce type I IFN production and pro-apoptotic signalling via IRF3-IRF7, and to activate the NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome resulting in IL-1\u03b2 production. The RNA receptor 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) has direct antiviral activity and degrades RNA via the generation of 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylates that activate ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L generates 5\u2032 OH-and 3\u2032 phosphate-containing RNA fragments that can stimulate RIG-I. The crucial RIG-I-stimulating structure has not been determined to date. The RNA receptors IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and doublestranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR) inhibit cap-dependent translation.

(a 5\u2032 cap binding and translation factor) 38 , which is sup ported by the observation that IFIT1 interferes with the formation of the 48S translation initiation complex 39 . To date, a crucial role for IFIT1 in the antiviral immune response was reported for negative sense singlestranded RNA (()ssRNA) viruses (vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus) and positive sense ssRNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses (West Nile virus and mouse hepatitis virus) but not picornaviruses which do not have a 5\u2032 cap 35, 36, 38 .",

AtoI conversions change the coding of RNA, as ino sine (I) is read as guanosine (G) instead of adenosine (A) by ribosomes, leading to the translation of altered, potentially nonfunctional, proteins 43 . Furthermore, conversion of AU to IU further destabilizes potential secondary structures important for viral RNA regula tion 43 . However, as detailed below, the destabilization of secondary structures can also impair recognition by PRRs, thereby supporting immune escape of the virus. In conclusion, the role of ADAR1 in the context of viral infections remains unclear and might depend on the type of the virus 44 .

The current model for the recognition of continuous dsRNA by MDA5 is that MDA5 uses the long dsRNA as a signalling platform to cooperatively assemble a filament of MDA5 molecules in a headtotail arrangement with exposed CARDs along the long dsRNA; the exposed CARDs in turn recruit and activate the downstream adaptor MAVS 54 . It has recently been shown that the RNAmodifying activity of ADAR1 (that is, the conversion of A to I) is required to prevent endogenous dsRNA from activating MDA5 (REFS 55,56); given that there is no evidence for endogenous dsRNA of that length, these data suggest that MDA5 senses ligand motifs in addition to very long dsRNA. Several studies demonstrate that MDA5 activation concurs with the formation of dsRNA in the course of viral replica tion 23 . Recent data suggest that MDA5 contributes to the detection of (\u2212)ssRNA viruses despite the absence of long dsRNA 45 . MDA5 was found to bind to and be activated by the mRNA of paramyxovirus (a (-)ssRNA virus) 57,58 , with paramyxovirus V protein binding to and inhibiting MDA5 but not RIGI 59 . Furthermore, an in vivo short hairpin RNA screen identified MDA5 as one of the key antiviral proteins involved in the antiviral defence response against influenza A virus 60 . These data indicate that (-)ssRNA viruses, which do not produce dsRNA, are sensed by MDA5 and can actively interfere with MDA5 function. It is therefore tempting to speculate that, in addition to long dsRNA, ssRNA with short basepaired secondary structures is recognized by MDA5.",

Furthermore, although TLR8 exclusively detects ssRNA, TLR7 primarily detects dsRNA but can also accommodate certain ssRNA oligo nucleotides 65 . However, the biological rationale behind these sequence preferences is still unknown. Of note, in a recent study a binding site for a single ssRNA U nucleo tide and another binding site for short RNA degradation products were found in a TLR8-ligand cocrystal, sug gesting that TLR8 is activated by degradation products of ssRNA 66 .

Experimental approaches using synthetic or highly purified enzymatically generated 5\u2032triphosphate dsRNA revealed a minimum length of 18-19 bp of dsRNA for RIGI recognition 73, 75 . Structural studies confirmed the molecular requirement of a base paired RNA region with a 5\u2032triphosphate end for RIGI recognition [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] . By contrast, one group reported that 5\u2032triphosphate RNA that forms a hairpin structure can activate RIGI even by a shorter 10 bp stretch 81 . However, it has to be considered that those hairpin RNAs could also form a 20mer hetero duplex dsRNA from two hairpins and in this way meet the minimum length of 18-19 bp (TABLE 1) . Nascent 5\u2032triphosphate RNA in the cytosol is indic ative of RNA that has formed outside the nucleus and thus denotes viral infection 72 or intracellular bacteria [82] [83] [84] . Enzymatic RNA biosynthesis is based on the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 linkage of nucleotide triphosphates and consequently leaves a free triphosphate at the 5\u2032 end in nascent RNA. Endogenous self RNA is generated in the nucleus and further processed (such as backbone or base modifica tions, cleavage and 5\u2032 capping), resulting in the removal or modification of accessible 5\u2032triphosphate ends before the RNA is translocation to the cytosol. By contrast, the perfect replication of an RNA strand is a hallmark of many viruses and is always linked to the formation of a blunt end dsRNA structure containing 5\u2032 triphosphate ends, which is recognized by cytosol RNA sensors. Furthermore, some ()ssRNA viruses (for example, influ enza virus) that minimize the occurrence of dsRNA by binding their ssRNA to nucleocapsid proteins possess genomes that form panhandle structures with a blunt end, due to partially complementary terminal sequences 23 . These partially complementary terminal sequences are a result of two ssRNA replication origins at the ends of the viral genomic RNA that are conserved, as both are rec ognized by the same viral RNA polymerase. Panhandle structures are recognized by RIGI, a cytosol RNA sensor.",

Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in the endolysosomal compartment detects CpG motif-containing DNA and RNA-DNA hybrids that have not been degraded by nucleases such as DNase I and DNase II. TLR9 signals via myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88), interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to induce type I IFN and the inflammasome-related factors pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) and NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3).

Most of the template RNA in the cytosol is rapidly degraded by RNase H. Using a mutated HIV1 reverse transcriptase, which impaired dsDNA but not ssDNA synthesis, the induction of type I IFN by lentiviral particles correlated with the presence of cytosolic ssDNA rather than the presence of dsDNA 133 . This finding is corroborated by the observation that elite controllers of HIV1 infection produce more type I IFN because of the cytosolic accumulation of HIV1 ssDNA reverse transcripts 140 .

Oxidated DNA is recognized by cGAS, resulting in the formation of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, which activates STING to induce type I interferon (IFN) production.",

To achieve sensitivity and specificity for viral nucleic acids among an abundance of self nucleic acids, this system further integrates the enzymatic function of extracellular and intracellular nucleases, allowing the detectability of nucleic acids to be determined by their stability against nucleases. Thus, potentially dangerous nucleic acids, such as those associ ated with viral particles or released during oxidative stress, are particularly potent immune activators. The nucleic acidsensing system further integrates information about the localization of detected nucleic acids in order to select the most appropriate response: TLRs localized in the endosomal membrane induce dif ferent signalling pathways to those induced by recep tors localized in the cytosol. The distinct function of nucleic acidsensing receptors is also regulated by their differential expression in functionally distinct immune cell subsets and even nonimmune cells. An important example is the restrictive expression of TLR7 and TLR9 to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which, upon stimulation, respond with very high levels of type I IFN production. In contrast, TLR8mediated stimulation of myeloid cells leads to the release of IL12.",

Genetic alterations can lead to enhanced or reduced expression or function of nucleic acidsensing receptors, DNases, RNases and nucleic acidmodifying enzymes. Perturbations of the balance between self and nonself nucleic acid recognition are involved in the pathogenesis of several rare autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (which is associated with genetic defects in TREX1, RNase H components and SAMHD1 (REF. 159)), Singleton-Merten syndrome (associated with mutations in the ATPase domain of RIGI, lead ing to constitutive RIGI activation by self RNA) 160 and STINGassociated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) 161 . These perturbations can also contribute to the pathogenesis of type I diabetes (owing to genetic vari ants of RIGI and MDA5 (REFS 2, 162, 163) ). Furthermore, recent work indicates that disrupted nucleic acid sensing is involved in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheuma toid arthritis and primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome 2, 164 . Several studies also implicate the RIGI-MAVS signalling axis in gut homeostasis [165] [166] [167] .
