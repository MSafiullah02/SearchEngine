Regarding the higher rates of RSV detection in children, RSV is well known to be a common pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children. Although not seen in our study, RSV can be a devastating pathogen in children that are very young or that have underlying illnesses 23, 24 ; more severe clinical outcomes and hospitalization have been described for children with RSV infection in our country. 25 Human metapneumovirus was also more frequently seen in children in our study; as a virus it is known to affect younger children suffering from lower respiratory infections. 23 however we did not see this association in our cohort. The role of RSV in producing a more severe disease especially in the adult population is a matter of debate. 30 In general, RSV appears to be associated with milder illness compared to influenza 31 mixed viral infections in a significant fraction of our population. Although data from our study concur with data from several published pediatric studies, we believe that our study's main strength is that it is one of the very few epidemiological studies examining mixed respiratory viruses in adults. Further, as an epidemiological study it does not attempt to explain a hypothesis; rather it assists in generating hypotheses regarding the role of mixed viral infections in the adult population and points out the lack of data in this significant research area.

Other studies have not confirmed this association similarly to our findings.9,10,16 Of interest, in our study single infections were associated with higher rates of hospitalization. Thiscould be attributed to a systemic bias of: a) mixed infections being more common in younger children that usually run a milder clinical disease course; b) selection bias regarding the presentation to the Emergency Room of a tertiary care Hospital of more severe cases of respiratory infection that most often had single rather than mixed infection, and; c) the possibility that the additional virus detected was accidentally discovered when it was actually having a colonizing role. Furthermore, in the last two seasons of the study we had very few cases of RSV or mixed infections. Whether the coexistence of RSV and influenza meant: a) establishment of RSV prior to influenza infection or vice-versa; b) the presence of one virus as a colonizer/pathogen that facilitated the establishment of the other or; c) both acted as co-pathogens at the same time, is a matter, future studies should try to elucidate. Regarding single virus infections the most prevalent respiratory viruses identified during the time of the study were influenza and RSV. Significant rates of RSV infection were noted during the winter season co-circulating with the influenza virus even during the 2009-10 pandemic season.

In addition, the limited data on other viruses besides the influenza virus and RSV is indicative of the dominance of these viruses during the winter season. Larger studies performed throughout the year, are necessary to clarify clinic-epidemiological associations for other viruses; for example, rhinoviruses (usually circulating in other seasons) or hMPV and bocavirus (both were more common in children in this study). Finally, we could not exclude the possibility of viral presence in patients with low viral loads in the upper airways as a reason for not detecting a virus in most of our carefully selected patients. It is well known that lower respiratory secretions have higher yield in viral detection in respiratory infections. Similarly, nasopharyngeal samples or pooled nasopharygeal and oropharyngeal samples have been reported as more appropriate for analyzing respiratory infections. 38,39 It is well known that nasopharyngeal sampling is more sensitive in detecting respiratory viruses. The detection of viruses by molecular technique in an oropharyngeal sample collected through a standardized technique has facilitated vastly in the performance of our study in a busy Emergency Room. In a subsample of our study concerning almost one third of our patients, the method described herein correlated well with nasopharyngeal swabbing results (manuscript under preparation). Nevertheless, it is possible, that our analysis was biased towards cases with higher viral loads that gave positive results more frequently than cases with lower loads. In a similar manner, we could not account for bacterial coinfections in our subjects as most of the patients unless seriously ill were not examined with specific testing for the presence of bacterial co-infection. It is has been recently reported that viral-bacterial coinfections are associated with a more complicated clinical course and adversely affect the prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia. 40 Nevertheless as shown in previous studies most of the acute respiratory infections in the general population are of viral origin. 41In conclusion, we describe for the first time in Greece, a large population based epidemiology study concerning the molecular detection of mixed viral respiratory infections in people presenting to a major tertiary care center.
