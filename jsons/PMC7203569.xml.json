During the 2014\u20102015 Ebola outbreak, Guinea started providing PLHIV with 6\u2010month ART refills \u2013 both to ensure that patients were not exposed to Ebola by visiting health facilities and because many health facilities closed [16, 17]. In Sierra Leone, peers started collecting and distributing ART refills to patients\u2019 homes or from community meeting points [18]. In response to conflict in the Central African Republic in 2015, patients were provided with 6\u2010month refills distributed by lay healthcare workers from decentralized peripheral health facilities [19]. More recently, in 2019 during armed conflict in the Cabo del Gado province of Mozambique, mobile clinics provided outreach and ART refills within communities [20].",

DSD provides the necessary tools to take these precautions; most importantly by adapting the \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d through reducing the frequency of visits and enabling ART refills outside of health facilities [1, 21]. A number of adaptations to DSD are outlined below and should be considered in addition to implementation of critical infection control and physical distancing measures that are recommended for everyone.",

Out\u2010of\u2010facility models for ART refills should be prioritized over facility\u2010based models. Refills should be extended to a minimum of three months with 6\u2010month refills permitted where stock allows; even if only as a once off or only for a specific regimen. All ART patients not yet clinically stable should receive a six\u2010month prescription at their next scheduled appointment and a minimum 3\u2010month treatment supply to ensure the most vulnerable PLHIV reduce health facility visits unless unwell. Longer prescriptions will allow for flexibility should it not be appropriate for patients to return to a health facility after three months.",

Where the DSD model takes place in a facility, such as through fast track and facility adherence clubs, infection control and physical distancing measures should be urgently put in place (e.g. triaging PLHIV with COVID\u201019 symptoms and providing their refills in separate area to other PLHIV), relocating refill collection to outside the facility buildings, advising and managing PLHIV queuing at least a metre and a half apart while waiting, and collecting treatment individually with no facilitated group interactions). A core priority must be to ensure that PLHIV can leave the facility or community venue after the shortest possible time, ideally with a single point of contact. As has already been recommended by the ministries of health in sub\u2010Saharan Africa, community\u2010based group DSD models should transition from meeting in\u2010person to staying connected via telephone or vitually, if possible [24].",

For PLHIV not yet on ART, informing them about the importance of taking ART to strengthen their immune system is now more critical than ever given that immunosuppression of HIV could place them at greater risk for COVID\u201019 [9]. PLHIV without COVID\u201019 symptoms should be started on ART on the day of diagnosis, preferably on a DTG\u2010regimen [26], at the location of the diagnosis and provided a 3\u2010month supply [12] at initiation to reduce the need to visit a health facility during COVID\u201019, with greater emphasis placed on initiation outside of facilities (e.g. through outreach and mobile services).",
