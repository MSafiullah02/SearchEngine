The control of carriage Staphylococcus aureus in stool is mandatory for some workers in hospital under French law. These stools were used as \u2018healthy individuals\u2019 without diarrhea. One of these control specimens was spiked with 108 colony\u2010forming units (CFU)/mL (final concentration) Salmonella enterica CIP 60.62 serotype Typhimurium (Collection de l'Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) and used as a positive control. Human diarrheal stool specimens routinely submitted to the M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection clinical microbiology laboratory, Marseille, containing S. enterica (n = 30), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (n = 1), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (n = 1), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), and adenoviruses (n = 4) were collected. Bacteria were routinely detected by culture methods, as previously described 2. Caliciviruses and enteroviruses were routinely detected by a specific real\u2010time PCR method using previously described primers 25, 26. Rotaviruses were detected by an immunochromatographic assay (Standard Diagnostics, Gurgaon Haryana, India). All of the viruses were further detected by electron microscopy observation. Among these 40 diarrheal stools, no stool specimen was co\u2010infected. No written consent was needed for this work in accordance with the \u2018LOI n\u00b0 2004\u2013800 relative \u00e0 la bio\u00e9thique\u2019 published in the \u2018Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise\u2019 on August 6, 2004 because no additional sample was taken for the study. According to this law, patients were informed that stool specimens could be used for anonymized studies. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Institut F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif de Recherche 48, Faculty of Medicine, Marseille, France, reference number 08\u2010002.",

To choose the 40 pathogens present on our DNA microarray, we based on a recent review of infectious diarrhea 2. DNA probes were designed on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence for 15 bacterial enteropathogens and specific gene sequences for an additional 13 bacterial enteropathogens as well as for viruses spotted on our microarray (Tables 1 and 2). Among these pathogens, we designed one specific probe for the detection of Grimontia hollisae that is responsible of human diarrhea for people who consumed raw shellfish, especially oysters or more rarely raw or undercooked fish 27, and Klebsiella oxytoca that is responsible of antibiotic\u2010associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC) especially in children 28. There are unpublished internal evidences of the association between Planctomycetes and the intestinal microbiota (Drancourt M, 2012, unpublished data), that is why we designed specific probes for the detection of Gemmata obscuriglobus, Pirellula staleyi, Planctomyces brasiliensis/maris, Planctomyces limnophilus, and Rhodopirellula baltica. In particular, five probes were spotted for the detection of pathogenic E. coli: for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), we spotted eae and stx1 gene probes 29; for enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), we spotted ipaB and ipaD gene probes 30; for enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), we spotted the eae gene probe 31; and for Shiga toxin\u2010producing E. coli (STEC), we spotted stx1 and stx2 genes probes 32. The DNA microarray (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France) comprised eight hybridization arrays containing 15 744 features, each consisting of two interlaced rectangular grids of 96 rows at 0.073323\u2013millimeter spacing by 82 columns at 0.127\u2013millimeter spacing. Each 60\u2010mer probe had an approximately 80 \u00b0C hybridization temperature. Each probe was spotted 194 times on each hybridization array.",

Briefly, stool specimens were freeze\u2010dried for 24 h in 1\u2010mL glass containers (Dominique Dustcher, Brumath, France) in the same lyophilizer with the negative control stool specimen. After lyophilization, stool specimens were regenerated in 250 \u03bcL PBS, resulting in a four\u2010fold concentration of the diarrheal stool specimens. Lyophilized specimens were then manipulated in parallel with non\u2010diarrheal stool specimens, which were not lyophilized. Instead, one gram of non\u2010diarrheal stool specimen was diluted into 5 mL PBS and vortexed with 3\u2010mm glass beads (Dominique Dustcher) for 30 s. In total, 250 \u03bcL of supernatant was collected to avoid fecal debris, and glass beads (size <106 \u03bcm; Sigma Aldrich, Saint\u2010Quentin Fallavier, France) were added to grind the specimen using the FastPrep\u00ae apparatus (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France) at 6.5 m/s for 90 s. This step was repeated once. A total of 25 \u03bcL of proteinase K (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and 180 \u03bcL of lysis buffer provided by the Nucleospin Tissue kit (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) were added before overnight incubation at 56 \u00b0C. Next, 100 \u03bcL total DNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcL specimen using the EZ1 DNA Tissue kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Extracted DNA was further purified using a phenol\u2010chloroform protocol 33. Each extracted specimen was analyzed with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) to evaluate DNA amounts. The non\u2010diarrheal stool specimens were not lyophilized because we used lyophilization to concentrate diarrheal stool where the pathogens could be in low inoculums to avoid the dilution effect.",

Real\u2010time PCR conditions included 2 min of UDG decontamination at 50 \u00b0C and 10 min of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 s at 95 \u00b0C, 35 s at 60 \u00b0C and 45 s at 72 \u00b0C. Each specific real\u2010time PCR assay included a positive and a negative control. The cut\u2010off for positivity was established at 38 cycle threshold (Ct). All the specimens were tested in duplicate. The extraction of C. jejuni was validated by classical PCR using two specific pairs of primers. The first pair targeted the fla gene 34, and the second one targeted the wlaC gene 35. These primer pairs were designed in our laboratory and generated 3 390\u2013 and 600\u2013bp fragments, respectively. Each PCR was performed in a 25\u2010\u03bcL mixture containing 2.5 \u03bcL of 10 \u00d7 buffer (Qiagen), 0.5 \u03bcL of each primer, 2.5 \u03bcL of deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France), one unit of Hot Start (Qiagen), 10.8 \u03bcL water and 5 \u03bcL DNA.

This result may be due to a lack of specificity of the probe despite our favorable in silico analysis. Alternatively, this observation could be explained by the fact that this gene is much more ubiquitous than previously reported.
