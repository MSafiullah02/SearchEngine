In this pandemic, 20 to 40 million deaths occurred worldwide, with more than 500,000 deaths in the United States. The \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was unique because the causative agent was very deadly, and it spread across the globe in 6 months. Almost half of those who died were young, healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 40. Many individuals died within the first few days after infection, and others died of complications soon thereafter.4\n",

However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most of these human cases have resulted from contact with infected domestic poultry (eg, chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with blood, and secretion/excretions from infected birds.7 The last epidemic of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, with 18 confirmed cases, and six deaths. Serologic data obtained during an epidemiologic study supported the theory that persons with high levels of exposure to infected poultry may be at increased risk for infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus. In 2001, Hong Kong reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza type A(H5N1) in its live-bird markets. As a result, all 1.2 million susceptible birds were destroyed as a preventive measure to stop the outbreak. The 2001 influenza A(H5N1) strain in Hong Kong did not affect humans.7\n",

Experts from around the world are watching the H5N1 situation very closely and are preparing for the possibility that the virus may begin to spread more easily and widely from person to person. The current ongoing spread of avian H5N1 influenza and a series of genetic reassortment events are traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial human outbreak in 1997 and subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002. Antigenic analysis of human isolates from 2005 provided evidence of antigenic drift among the most recently circulating H5N1 strains. Avian influenza A(H5N1) is now considered the most likely virus to ignite the next pandemic. International health experts indicate that 2 of the 3 conditions for an influenza pandemic have already been met. First, a strain of the virus, A(H5N1), has reemerged to which humans have little or no immunity; second, this strain can jump between species. The only remaining obstacle is that this strain of avian influenza has not yet mutated into a form that is easily transmitted from human to human.9\n",

Scientists have found strong evidence the 1918 influenza virus was derived wholly from an ancestor that originally infected birds. The 1918 virus was not a reassortant virus, as were those of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. In these outbreaks, human and avian influena viruses infected the same person at the same time, thus allowing their genes to mix (reassort). The 1918 virus more likely was an entirely avian-like virus that adapted to humans.13 Because of these concerns, the WHO declared a phase 3 pandemic alert in November 2005.14\n",

However, there is currently no vaccine available to protect humans against avian influenza H5N1. In 2004, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) awarded contracts to 2 companies to manufacture an inactivated vaccine from an H5N1 virus isolated in Southeast Asia. These trials are testing the vaccine's safety and ability to generate an immune response in 450 healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years at 3 sites. In October 2005, a second trial was undertaken to determine the dose-related safety of inactivated H5N1 vaccine in healthy elderly adults.22 In addition, the NIAID and MedImmune Inc. have a cooperative research and development agreement for the development of vaccines against avian influenza viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics.23 However, any vaccine that is developed must closely match the pandemic virus, and large-scale commercial production will not start until the new virus has emerged and a pandemic has been declared. In any event, current global production capacity falls far short of the demand expected during a pandemic.5\n",
