The early CT findings after onset were single ground-glass opacity or ground-glass with consolidation involving multiple lobes. About one week after onset, CT findings were multifocal ground-glass opacities or ground-glass with consolidation involving multiple lobes. The CT findings at different times after onset shown ground-glass with consolidation-, but the lesions at about one week after onset were more severe. Patient 6 underwent the initial CT scan on the day before onset, and the result was normal. The second CT scan was performed on the first day after onset, showing a unique ground-glass opacity at the middle lobe of right lung. Two asymptomatic patients underwent the initial CT scan on the 12th and 15th days after exposure, among which the CT results of the older patient was more severe than that of the younger patient. Symptoms first onset in young man, and finally in older man, with the most severe symptoms and CT findings in young man, mild symptoms and CT findings in infant, possibly because of the body's different immune responses to viral infections. CT images were all positive on the 15th day after exposure of this familial cluster. Therefore, we suggested that when performing a CT scan on people with a history of epidemiology, it is possible to perform CT scan one day after onset, . If CT result is negative , re-examination should be completed within one week.. Asymptomatic patients can undergo CT scan on the 10th to 15th day after exposure. If the image still shows normal, follow-up CT examination should be peformed every 3 to 5 days.",

In this groupof cases we reported, the course of disease of most patients is in the early stage and one case is in the advanced stage. The sensitivity of leukopenia ,lymphocytopenia, and C-reactive protein at the initial stage of onset was lower than that of CT. Five patients in this group started with elevated procalcitonin, which is inconsistent with current studies (most are normal) [8]. After infection, the symptom of infant is mild and atypical. The initial CT result after the onset of symptom is mild than that of adults. Laboratory examination is also different from that of adults, which requires our attention.",

Patients 4 and 5 remained asymptomatic during hospitalization, while patients 6 and 7 had symptoms successively.
