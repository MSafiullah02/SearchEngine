Orthopaedic practice models of AAHKS members differ significantly and will be affected to varying extents moving forward; the ability to increase production during the 2nd half of the fiscal year for the private practice, academic, and hospital employed surgeon must be considered both separately and as a collective; needs in terms of optimal industry support will be heterogeneous. Due to the rapidly changing environment and risk of a resurgent COVID-19 virus, long-term strategies must also be articulated to safely prevent another catastrophic full-scale shutdown of elective cases.",

As this first wave of COVID-19 tamponades, the expected surge of elective cases currently backlogged will likely entail maximally stressing the elective capabilities in certain centers; the needs will be varied and inherently dependent on surgeon practice model. Both sides of the aisle of our profession are currently bracing for the possibility of extended weekday schedules and/or weekend elective schedules where none existed prior. There will be increased emphasis on efficiency of the non-surgical aspects of cases: pre-op preparation, anesthesia time, turn-over times in the OR, etc. Surgical efficiency will also be stressed, yet hopefully maintaining its rightful place behind quality and safety.

It is possible that due to the financial blow of COVID-19, the model currently in place is urged to change in order to produce more savings on implant costs.
