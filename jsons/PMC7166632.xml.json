            "text": "One research team has proposed that BST2 inhibits virus release by tethering nascent virions to cell surfaces via the N\u2010terminal transmembrane domain and C\u2010terminal GPI anchor.14 Most BST2\u2010restricted enveloped viruses bud directly from cell surfaces, but a small number of enveloped viruses (eg, herpesviruses) are subject to BST2\u2010related restrictions even though their final envelopment entails membranes from TGN and/or endosomal compartments and egression via exocytosis.15, 16 In a previous study we reported that the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV\u2010229E), whose assembly and budding occurs at the ER\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment and whose virions are released via vesicle exocytosis,17, 18, 19 is also subject to BST2 inhibition. Results from electron microscopy analyses indicate the presence of HCoV\u2010229E virions on cell surfaces or on the membranes of intracellular vesicles that tend to cluster with BST2. This suggests the BST2\u2010triggered tethering of budding virions to vesicle membranes that remain on cell surfaces at the plasma membrane after exocytosis.17 BST2 has been described as moderately restricting the release of the hepatitis C virus, whose assembly takes place in the ER and whose release from cells via secretory pathways occurs in a manner similar to that of coronaviruses.20, 21 Combined, these data support the assumption that enveloped virus budding and release occurring at the plasma membrane or in an intracellular compartment is subject to BST2 blocking. BST2 is a component of innate immune response in the form of restricted enveloped virion release, and many viruses have evolved specific antagonists to counteract BST2 antiviral activity: HIV\u20101 Vpu, HIV\u20102 Env, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef and Env, Ebola and Sendai virus GP, Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus K5, and influenza virus neuraminidase are all capable of antagonizing BST2.2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 22 Since some of these anti\u2010BST2 viral factors are viral envelope glycoproteins, there is speculation that SARS\u2010CoV spike glycoprotein may possess the property to counteract the BST2 blocking of virus release. Our work is built in part on an earlier finding by another research team that the ORF7a accessory protein (encoded by SARS\u2010CoV) inhibits the BST2 tethering of virions.23 We also found that the SARS\u2010CoV spike (S) protein is capable of downmodulating BST2, thus mitigating the BST2\u2010mediated restriction of virus\u2010like particle (VLP) release, and suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving additional anti\u2010BST2 factors.",

To test the ability of BST2 to inhibit coronavirus VLP release, M, and N proteins from SARS\u2010CoV or HC0V\u2010229E were coexpressed with or without BST2 in 293T cells; NL4.3delVpu (a Vpu\u2010deficient HIV\u20101 virion\u2010producing expression vector) served as a control. Since SARS\u2010CoV M can be released into the medium as vesicles31 but N cannot be released without M coexpression,32 N detected in medium indicates VLPs formed by M and N. Accordingly, VLP release levels can be measured as N detected in medium.

This suggests that VLP release is also subject to restrictions associated with endogenous BST2. To determine whether reduced VLP yield is a result of VLPs being tethered to cell membranes by BST2, cells were treated with subtilisin, a nonspecific protease capable of triggering cell surface\u2010associated virion release via BST2 cleavage.17, 33 Our results indicate increased medium\u2010associated VLP quantities following subtilisin treatment (Figures 2A\u2010C, lane 6 vs. lane 4), confirming that BST2 trapped VLPs on cell surfaces.

Since BST2 is known to restrict HIV\u20101 release in the absence of Vpu, we performed tests to determine whether SARS\u2010CoV S counteracts BST2 and therefore supports HIV\u20101 release. As shown in the upper panel of Figure 4A (lane 2 vs. lanes 3 and 4), the inhibitory effect of BST2 on NL4.3delVpu virion release decreased in the presence of either SARS\u2010CoV S or Vpu in step with reduced BST2 expression (Figure 4A, middle panel, lanes 2\u20104), suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV S is capable of promoting the release of HIV\u20101 virus particles from cells via BST2 downregulation. Additional experiments confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV S, like Vpu, is capable of reducing BST2 expression in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Figures 4B and C).

We observed that BST2 and S colocalized in perinuclear areas, but BST2 signals were barely detectable on cell surfaces. Instead, BST2 largely localized in perinuclear areas regardless of whether or not it was coexpressed with S (Figure 6A). This is consistent with a previous report that unlike HeLa\u2010endogenous BST2 (which localizes on cell surfaces as well as in the perinuclear area), exogenous BST2 predominantly localizes in perinuclear areas, with little distribution on cell surfaces.41 Nevertheless, flow cytometry quantification suggests that BST2 cell surface expression is noticeably reduced in 293T cells following SARS\u2010CoV S coexpression (Figure 6C). In the case of HeLa cells (which constitutively express BST2), we did found SARS\u2010CoV S colocalized with BST2 in the plasma membrane (Figure 6B). BST2 green fluorescence intensity on HeLa cell surfaces decreased slightly following SARS\u2010CoV S coexpression, suggesting that the capacity of SARS\u2010CoV S to counteract the BST2\u2010associated inhibition of virion release was due in part to cell surface BST2 downmodulation.",

Since the BST2 inhibition of HIV\u20101 release via virion tethering at cell surfaces is well documented, we used a Vpu\u2010deficient HIV\u20101 virus\u2010producing vector (NL4.3delVpu) as a control in our experiments. As shown in Figure 2, coronavirus VLPs (similar to those of HIV\u20101) were tethered to cell surfaces by BST2, and BST2 inhibited SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010229E VLP release in a BST2 dimerization\u2010dependent manner, similar to HIV\u20101 (Figure 3). Further, in the same manner, as Vpu, SARS\u2010CoV S facilitated HIV\u20101 release via BST2 downregulation (Figure 4). We determined that Vpu downmodulated BST2 via proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways and that the predominant lysosomal pathway was mediated by SARS\u2010CoV S (Figure 5). Our confocal microscopy observations suggest that SARS\u2010CoV S colocalized with BST2 at HeLa cell surfaces (Figure 6). SARS\u2010CoV S likely binds to BST2, after which it serves as a target for lysosomal degradation. Vpu is capable of trapping BST2 intracellularly and preventing its recycling back into the plasma membrane.29, 35, 37, 42, 43 Whether SARS\u2010CoV S similarly counteracts BST2 requires further investigation.",
