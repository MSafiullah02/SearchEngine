Currently, five ebola species (earlier they were considered strains or subtypes of one species) are recognized, namely Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV), Reston ebolavirus (RESTV), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV).1, 3 Especially, EBOV and SUDV are responsible for serious outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), or Ebola virus disease (EVD), among humans and nonhuman primates in the regions of sub\u2010Saharan Africa. EBOV is the most virulent ebola virus with fatality rate ranging from 50 to 90%.",

LJ001 intercalates into viral membranes preventing virus\u2013cell fusion, but the host cells can overcome the toxic effects of LJ001 due to their repair by cellular lipid biosynthesis. The rhodanine derivative LJ001 was suggested to inhibit viral entry at a step after virus binding and before virus\u2013cell fusion, but the molecular target and molecular mechanism remained elusive. Later, Vigant et al.68 identified the unsaturated fatty acid chains of viral membrane phospholipids as the major target of LJ001 antiviral activity. In the membrane bilayer, LJ001 generates singlet oxygen (1O2) and subsequent lipid oxidation results in changes to the biophysical properties of the viral membrane that disrupts the virus ability to undergo virus\u2013cell fusion. Furthermore, elucidation of the mode of action and subsequent structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) optimization of LJ001 led to a new class of oxazolidine\u20102,4\u2010dithiones, for example, compound JL103 (Fig. 3),68 as membrane\u2010targeted photosensitizers with increased potencies, 1O2 quantum yields, and red\u2010shifted absorption spectra.",
