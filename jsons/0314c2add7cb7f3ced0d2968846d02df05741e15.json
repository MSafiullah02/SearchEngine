            "text": "The basis for a family contact prophylaxis approach is that considerable transmission of viral respiratory infection occurs in the family setting. In our earlier study of contact prophylaxis in adults, interferon-a, prevented rhinovirus-associated colds in those who used contact prophylaxis during family episodes. 1 This episodic use of intranasal spray was associated with acceptably low levels of nasal irritation. Efficacy in the prevention of \"definite\" episodes of illness was 86% if rhinovirus were isolated from the index case in a family. But efficacy was confined to family episodes in which rhinovirus was cultured either from the index case or from one or more of the secondary cases. The net benefit to those who used the active preparation was a 20% difference in respiratory symptom days. The present study used identical virological laboratory procedures which were carried out by the same laboratory personnel as those used in the adult studies. Rhinovirus was grown in 10.7% of medicable episodes in the present study. The comparable percentage was 15.5% in the adult study. Thus a lesser net reduction in episodes in this population would be expected than that which we observed in the adult study because of the smaller contribution of rhinovirus. Accordingly, we do not have a basis for expecting a reduction of as much as a mean of 2.3 (20%) of the 11.7 days of respiratory symptomatology which are theoretically available for prevention. Thus, we could expect for 18.2 days of prophylactic dosing with interferon, a prevention of fewer than 2.3 days of respiratory symptoms per child during the average 204 days of surveillance to which each \"medicable\" and 359 episodes 9 when they did not have a cold, 64.8010 were claimed to wheeze whenever they got a cold and 27% wheezed occasionally with exercise. At birth 44.5% had experienced breathing difficulty and 28.9% had weighed less than 3000 g. All of the study children had been admitted to hospital during their first year of life, suffering from lower respiratory illness associated either with isolation of, or seroconversion to, respiratory syncytial virus. Fifteen per cent were taking regular medication for asthma. For 11 of the children the symptom diary showed a consistent pattern of symptomatology which was declared in the early months of the study by the investigators as \"background\" against which judgements about the categorization of other episodic symptoms were superimposed.",

Table 2 shows a comparison of culture results in the 155 episodes which were medicable with those 359 episodes that were not. Rhinoviruses were implicated less frequently in the medicable group (10.7% of 122 cultures compared with 15.9% of 232 cultures collected from children who were experiencing \"non-medicable\" episodes). A comparison of the symptom profiles of episodes caused by rhinovirus with those from which parainfluenza virus was grown, showed that the parainfluenza virus episodes lasted longer (12.7 daysv. lOA days) and were more often characterized by wheeze (3.0 days per episode v. 1.1 days per episode) than the episodes associated with rhinovirus.",

In this study, wheeze was observed for an average of 1.1 days of every lOA days of rhinovirus episodes.

Further, it would seem that while they experience possibly preventable rhinovirus-associated illness, this infection is not associated with substantial lower respiratory symptomatology and that for them the cost of the intranasal medication would be relatively unlikely to be balanced by clinically appreciable benefits.",

DrugInlllactions, Whilst nospecificdru9inleraclions have been idenlified, theconcomitanl useof disopyramlde with other Type 1 antiarrhythmic agents (such as quinidine or procainamlde) and/or beta-biockers should be reserved for patients with life-threatening arrhythmias who are demonstrably unresponsive to single agent antiarrhythmic Iherapy.

            "text": "ABSTRACT Nineteen patients with spasmodictorticollis, unresponsiveto standard therapy, were administered local injections of botulinum-A toxin into the affected muscles. During an average follow-up period of 11.5 months, a more than 25% improvement was noted in 14 of 19 patients. All those with purelyfocaldystonia and 9 of 10 patientswitha disease history of less than three years benefited from treatment, Side effects were insignificant and transient. Botulinum toxin is a very effective and safe method of treatment for spasmodic torticollis, (Med J Aust 1990; 152: 528-530) T he term \"dystonia\" was coined by Oppenheim in 1911 1 in describing six patients with alterations in muscle tone, sustained posturing and involuntary movements. Since then the definition of dystonia has undergone many modifications, and is now described as \"a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures\" .2 Dystonia is classified according to age of onset, aetiology (symptomatic or idiopathic) and distribution. Thus, there are focal, segmental and generalized dystonias. Where a single area is involved, such as the eye (blepharospasm), face (oromandibular dystonia), neck (torticollis), or vocal cords (spasmodic dysphonia) the condition is called focal dystonia.\" The commonest form of focal dystonia is spasmodic torticollis (ST) with a suggested prevalence of three per 10 000. 3 When two or more contiguous parts are involved in the disease process, such as the face and the neck, for example, it is called segmental dystonia, and generalized dystonia when one or both legs and the trunk are affected. Hemidystonia involving half the body usually indicates symptomatic dystonia, with abnormality in the basal ganglia.Spasmodic torticollis was first described by Francois Rabelais, the French humanist, author and physician, in the 16th century. The mean age of presentation is 40 to 50 years, and the female to male ratio is 3:2. 4 Various combinations of neck posture may occur, such as laterocollis, retrocollis and antecollis. The head may be tilted onto one shoulder, and one of the shoulders may be elevated and displaced anteriorly. Intermittent or continuous tremor or spasmodic movement may occur. The severity of the abnormal postures and movements can be aggravated by stress and an activity such as walking, while improvement may be achieved by the patient touching the chin, face or the back of the head. This is the so-called geste antagonistique, quite characteristic of ST but lacking an adequate explanation at the present time, The involuntary movements cease during sleep. Pain can be very severe, intractable and disabling. The onset may be sudden or gradual, the condition usually progressing for a few years and then becoming stationary. Remissions occur in 15% of patients, usually in the first few years after the onset. Many patients are unable to work, and even such activities as driving a car, eating, reading or watching television may become difficult or impossible. The obvious neck deformity causes a constant embarrassment, and the patient's suffering is increased by the lack of understanding and the ineffective therapies available. Medical treatment and psychotherapy are usually unsuccessful. 5-7 Surgical treatment may have adverse results,\" a significant morbidity and even a small mortality\" Botulinum-A toxin, a neuroparalytic agent, has recently been used in the treatment of focal dystonias. It was pioneered for the treatment of strabismus by Dr Alan Scott'? and has been shown to be effective for the treatment of blepharospasm, 11-14 oromandibular dystonias, IS spasmodic torticollis.v?? spasmodic dysphonia\" and focal hand dystonias.:\" Clostridium botulinum produces eight distinct neurotoxins, which cause widespread muscular paralysis, characteristic of the often fatal syndrome of botulism. When botulinum-A toxin is injected intramuscularly in minute quantities local denervation and muscle weakness occur, lasting for several weeks until the nerve endings regenerate. The toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering with calcium channels.\"Over the past two years we have used botulinum-A toxin to treat over 75 patients suffering from ST. We report the results of a pilot study of the first 19 patients, who have been followed up for an average of 11.5 months.",
