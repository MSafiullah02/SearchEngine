Respirology 2003; 8 : S15-S19 Air-space disease is typical in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and may be indistinguishable from pneumonia of other causes. In the majority of patients, ground glass opacities on chest radiographs progress rapidly to focal, multifocal or diffuse consolidation. Unilateral involvement is common in the early acute phase, becoming bilateral at maximal lung involvement. Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after onset of illness, with radiographic scores reflecting temporal changes in clinical and laboratory parameters such as oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) and liver transaminases. Pleural effusions, cavitating consolidation and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are not typical radiographic features. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces are complications that are associated with extensive disease, with or without assisted ventilation.",

The characteristic HRCT feature in the acute phase is ground-glass opacities with smooth interlobular septal thickening, sometimes with consolidation in a subpleural location, which progress rapidly to involve other areas of the lungs. Temporal lung changes documented on HRCT suggest that some residual opacities found may not be reversible.",

            "text": "When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first surfaced in China in November 2002, and later in Hong Kong in February 2003 with devastating reverberations around the world, little was known of its epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical course and radiological features. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued case definitions for the diagnosis of probable and suspected cases of SARS. [1] [2] [3] Due to the lack of data on the disease, these definitions were rather non-specific and included anyone who had a febrile respiratory illness since November 1, 2002 with radiographic infiltrates consistent with a pneumonia, had been in close contact with a SARS patient or had a history of travel to an affected area or residence in an affected area, during the 10 days prior to the onset of illness. 3 The aetiological agent of SARS was initially believed to be the human metapneumovirus, the coronavirus, or both, although it is now increasingly evident from molecular and serologic assays, virus isolation techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Retrospective diagnosis of SARS can be made from the detection of anti-SARS-CoV IgG in the serum obtained 15-21 days after the onset of symptoms. 4 As seroconversion is a delayed phenomenon, it does not lend itself as a rapid diagnostic test. Viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and stool of patients can be detected using a reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) assay but is only positive in approximately 50-60% of cases. 4, 8 As a rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS is currently unavailable, the diagnosis of SARS remains a clinical one that depends largely on radiographic evidence of pneumonia, at least in the initial stage of the infection. 3 Therefore, radiological assessment of SARS plays an important role in the management of SARS. 1,2,9-23",

A smaller proportion of patients (17.4%) showed pattern 2 in which there were two radiographic peaks occurring 6.3 \u00b1 3 and 13.5 \u00b1 3.7 days, respectively, after onset of fever and before improvement. A minority of patients demonstrated one of two patterns: pattern 3, where there was minimal radiographic progression throughout the illness prior to resolution in 10 (7%) patients, and pattern 4, where there was relentless progression of radiographic opacities culminating in death in 6 of 7 (4%) patients at the time of publication. 14 In a separate review of 40 patients with probable SARS, consolidation largely followed two patterns of serial radiographic change that reflected the clinical outcome, whereby the consolidation either improved rapidly or, in the majority of patients (72%), progressed to bilateral extensive pneumonia.

Radiographic parameters that were associated with a poor treatment response in a separate study included high radiographic scores at the time of treatment, high radiographic score at maximal lung changes, and longer time period to develop maximal lung changes. 10 As a general rule, pleural effusions per se and mediastinal lymphadenopathy were not seen on CXR, although small pleural effusions were detected on HRCT scans, and when fluid overload or heart failure supervened. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] 22 Atelectasis was not a presenting radiographic feature in any of the published series, although volume loss has been noted with disease progression and in the convalescent period (Ooi, pers. comms., 2003.) Although CXRs cleared by the time of discharge in most patients, residual opacities were noted in some patients. HRCT scans are helpful in the postdischarge period to further characterise these opacities in order to determine whether they are irreversible or not. Cavitation within areas of consolidation in the acute period has not been reported although this can develop in patients with a protracted course, particularly in those requiring mechanical ventilation, when superadded infection may be a complicating factor (Ooi, pers. comms.) (Fig. 2c ). Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces (Fig. 1d ) are other complications that occur and are associated with extensive disease, with or without assisted ventilation.",

The characteristic HRCT feature in the acute phase was ground-glass opacities, sometimes with consolidation in a subpleural location, which progressed rapidly to involve other areas of the lungs. [11] [12] [13] 15, 22, 23 The ground glass opacities were associated with smooth interlobular and intralobular septal thickening (Fig. 3a) .",

The peripheral location of the air-space opacities is also found in conditions such as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and eosinophilic pneumonia.
