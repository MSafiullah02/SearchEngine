            "text": "The proportion of asymptomatic patients described worldwide is very small (889 confirmed asymptomatic cases/45,561 confirmed cases in China; 2.0% [5] ), but this could be underestimated because of the diagnostic methods that involved exclusively RNA detection by RT-PCR of secretions (nasopharyngeal and throat swabs and in stool samples [4, 9] ). RNA in nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples has been shown to become undetectable within 6-22 days (mean: 12 days) of illness onset in children [4] . The excretion of the virus could be shorter in asymptomatic patients and there is no systematic sampling series in asymptomatic persons. The age distribution of asymptomatic patients is not detailed in the literature. Do children represent less severe cases, are they less infected, or are they being underdiagnosed as less symptomatic [10] ?",

However, a higher risk of preterm birth is reported (five preterm neonates at 30-33 gestational weeks, seven at around 34-36 gestational weeks, and 12 at full term/24 neonates), and maternal infection could be involved in neonatal distress; one neonate died but his samples were negatives for COVID-19 virus [13] [14] [15] [16] . The vertical transmission before and during delivery is unknown. Some data suggest that no viral RNA is found in amniotic fluid, cord blood, or breastmilk [13] , but neonatal infected cases have been reported and they evolved favorably [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In cases of confirmed or suspected infection in pregnant women, it is necessary to maintain a high level of surveillance during the 14-21 days following birth. Breastfeeding should be encouraged as it is the best source of nutrition and also provides antibodies; the spread of the virus in milk is not well known. Infected mothers should wash their hands often with soap and water or hydroalcoholic solutions and, if possible, wear a face mask. If a mother is too tired to breastfeed, it can be suggested to express the milk with manual or electric pumps so that a healthy member of the family or a caregiver may give the expressed milk to the infant. Hygiene is required when handling the pump and bottles in order to prevent transmission of viruses or bacteria [21] .",

Moreover, children as asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers of the virus may transmit the virus to other groups (elderly relatives, caregivers, etc.) even if no transmission of the COVID-19 virus from children to adults has been described to date. Children and their relatives should act to prevent the spread of respiratory infections (covering coughs, cleaning hands often with soap and water or hydro- alcoholic solutions), and in the event of suspected or confirmed cases they should wear a mask. Furthermore, orofecal transmission is suspected as COVID-19 virus DNA has been detected in stool samples.",
