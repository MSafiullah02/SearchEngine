            "text": "On an airplane, when there is an emergency, parents are told to put on their own oxygen masks first so that they can effectively support their children and keep them safe. In the time of this pandemic, practitioners must thus teach parents how to care for themselves if they are to expand their ability to nurture their children through adversity. Similarly, if practitioners are to effectively support other families, they will also need tools for managing their own distress and buffer against the effects of burnout. The goal of this article is thus to provide immediate tools that strengthen both parent and practitioner resiliency and flexibility in the context of COVID-19. Such tools may also support families beyond present challenges by creating longer term resilience. Specifically, we will describe how to support parents\u2019 psychological flexibility and self-care. Psychological flexibility refers to the ability to recognize and adapt to situational demands, to remain aware and open to the present moment such that one can recognize and shift behavior strategies as required by situational demands, and to engage in actions that are congruent with one\u2019s deeply held values (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2012; Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010). Self-care, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to the practice of taking action to preserve or improve one\u2019s own health, especially during periods of stress, or \u201cthe ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider\u201d (World Health Organization, Regional Office for South-East Asia, 2014: p. 15). It is our contention that supporting psychological flexibility (Burke & Moore, 2015; Da Paz & Wallander, 2017; Hartley, Dorstyn, & Due, 2019; Irwin, Jesmont, & Basu, 2019; Moyer et al., 2018; Williams, Ciarrochi, & Heaven, 2012) and self-compassion (Gouveia, Carona, Canavarro, & Moreira, 2016; Neff & Faso, 2014) in parents is foundational to bolstering and maintaining psychological well-being in families and that providing parents with tools in these domains is to empower them to better cope with conditions of stress and uncertainty.",

In behavioral terms, mindfulness and acceptance processes involve paying purposeful attention to the present moment, allowing or making space for unwanted thoughts and emotions, and relinquishing attachment to thoughts as literal truths, where that is helpful. Commitment and valued action involve making a promise to oneself about something that really matters and following through with that commitment. Self-compassion involves self-kindness, awareness of our common humanity, and willingness to acknowledge difficult thoughts and emotions, without attachment (Neff, 2012).",

            "text": "Given the urgent need to equip behavioral practitioners with resources for parents, we have avoided more academic language in favor of a more practical approach: We have attempted to describe these tools in such a way that is widely accessible and that may be put into practice immediately. For example, we intentionally use lay language such as \u201cthoughts and feelings\u201d instead of \u201cprivate events,\u201d \u201ctaking our minds literally\u201d instead of \u201cexcessively rigid rule following with respect to private verbal stimuli,\u201d and \u201ccoercion\u201d instead of \u201cexcessive reliance on negative reinforcement and punishment.\u201d The principles behind these strategies are evidence based; however, many of their particulars have not been investigated within the context of a pandemic. Nonetheless, they are firmly grounded in behavioral principles. We have intentionally left the fine-grained behavioral interpretations of ACT procedures out of this article, but we refer the reader to Chapter 20 of Cooper, Heron, and Heward (2020) for behavioral conceptual analyses of ACT. Furthermore, the strategies in this article are not offered as alternatives to more mainstream applied behavior-analytic procedures but as supplements to them. Overall, the approaches in this article seek to increase access to positive reinforcement and reduce levels of aversive control in the lives of parents and children. We do not need more evidence that an abundance of positive reinforcement and reductions in aversive control are beneficial to those we work with (and all of humanity, for that matter).",

Thus, it is important to help parents focus their efforts on things that they can influence within the system of the family. With the understanding that everything interacts, this focus should aim toward those areas that may have the most impact. For example, sleep deprivation can have a troubling impact on appetite, social interactions, emotional responses, and immune function (Furman et al., 2019). A little bit of improvement in a single thing like sleep can also make a positive impact on these same areas. Parents do not have to lift it all at once.",

A doughnut on occasion has little health impact. Doughnuts all day, every day, on the other hand, may be problematic. It is possible that parents may be insensitive to the long-term effects of unhelpful patterns due to more immediate contingencies dominating their behavior: Consider Gerald Patterson\u2019s work on coercion (Patterson, 1982). Patterson illustrated how parents quickly get pulled into coercive cycles with their children, due to the powerful (immediate) effects of punishment and negative reinforcement on parent and child behavior, despite long-term negative effects on both parents and children. Mindful awareness of triggers to unhelpful patterns opens a space in which parents can choose to do something different, and potentially more helpful, for themselves and their children. We may encourage parents to become aware of their behavioral patterns and to notice how those patterns are working for them, both in the short and long term. Parents may then have the space to create new patterns of flexible, workable parenting behaviors over time.",

To introduce the practice, you may ask parents this question: Over the course of your day, what percentage of the time are you right here, right now, versus \u201ctime traveling\u201d? That is, worrying about the future and what might happen or ruminating about the past\u2014about things you should have done or didn\u2019t do? Most people notice that they are actually in the present moment for just a modicum of time, and it is an interesting experience to notice that \u201cthe lights are on, and no one is home\u201d for much of the day, so to speak. Encourage parents to pay attention on purpose briefly, at various points of the day, while engaged in daily activities. It is helpful to simply bring your awareness gently to the present by slowing down\u2014and either noticing what you are experiencing with your five senses, or, alternately, pausing\u2014and hold a space in which you can check in with yourself with these simple questions: How am I doing? What is it that I most need right now? It is also helpful to encourage parents to pay purposeful attention to even small things that are meaningful, and to practice bringing awareness to things that they are grateful for\u2014for example, drinking a cup of coffee, feeling the softness and warmth of the bed in the morning, kissing their child\u2019s forehead at bedtime, or a quiet moment before sleep.",

It refers to an awareness of, and openness to, the inevitable sadness and stress that are part of life, and the flip side of joy, without struggle. One context in which nonacceptance can show up for parents is when they feel they have made mistakes, or failed, in child-rearing duties. This tends to engage their critical minds and evokes thoughts like \u201cYou are not enough. You are a terrible parent. You are a hot mess compared to other parents.\u201d It also evokes a struggle to \u201cfeel better,\u201d which can compound and intensify the situation, thus occupying so much of parents\u2019 mental bandwidth that they have none left to be truly present and connected with their children. In your meetings with parents, take some time to make a space for them to voice these thoughts, and normalize them. Resist the urge to immediately jump in to \u201cfix\u201d it or problem-solve it away. Instead, we might nonjudgmentally let a parent know that it is okay not to be okay: This is a struggle for all of us\u2014sometimes, me too. See if you can make a space to notice those thoughts and feelings; see if you can soften yourself around them, breathe into them. Simply allowing parents to be vulnerable\u2014and perhaps sharing a tiny glimpse of your own vulnerability\u2014may help them carry these difficult experiences more gently and with less effort.",

            "text": "Evolution has conferred to humans the remarkable ability to learn indirectly, without training, through language. For example, we can avoid danger when someone gives us the rule \u201cdon\u2019t touch that; it\u2019s hot\u201d or thoughts such as \u201cif you don\u2019t organize your child\u2019s homeschooling properly, you will ruin them!\u201d Our ability to treat our thoughts as real things, called fusion, has given us marvelous flexibility in adapting to our changing environment; however, it can also evoke rigid and inflexible patterns of behavior if we always treat thoughts as literal truths. This can create challenges when parents experience triggering thoughts about current stressors. Thus, a simple practice that you can teach parents is to notice thoughts for what they are\u2014impermanent mental phenomena that are sometimes useful and sometimes not. Encourage parents to do the following: If you are feeling stressed, take a few moments to slow yourself down and notice the process of your thinking. You may notice your mind is pulling you this way and that or going a hundred miles an hour. See if you can bring your curiosity to your thoughts\u2014slow down each one, imagine stretching it out like taffy, and add to it the stem \u201cI\u2019m noticing the thought . . .\u201d or \u201cMy mind is giving me the thought . . .\u201d Take a few moments to do this \u201cthought spotting\u201d exercise, and as one thought passes, be curious about what the next thought is that might arise. Practice this a few times throughout the day, when you think of it, and notice anything about this experience that surprises you or that you didn\u2019t expect. In essence, this practice supports mindful awareness of, and detachment from, one\u2019s thoughts such that parents are better able to notice and be influenced by the relevant cues in their environments.",

We are so often in our heads that it may be a challenge to track or notice the effects of our behavior on others. It is this insensitivity that factors into the intransigence of our rigid and unhelpful patterns of behavior, such as coercion. Thus, practitioners may encourage parents, during calm moments, to reflect back\u2014for example, on interactions with their children\u2014as follows: When you have a few moments to yourself, pause and see if you can imagine yourself as you were earlier today, when you felt like you were struggling. Slow down and notice yourself in action, as though you were watching yourself on a movie screen. Notice your face, your tone of voice; notice whatever thoughts and feelings show up in the moment. Notice what is happening between you and your child\u2014see if you can notice their face, how they are looking at you. What might their experience be? What patterns do you see? In doing so, you may evoke parents\u2019 mindful awareness of potentially unhelpful patterns\u2014such as denial of self-care, autopilot, or avoidance. You may also help them notice and reinforce their \u201cwins,\u201d of which they may be unaware.",

Values have the potential to fundamentally alter our relationship with adversity. Adversity in the context of what is most important to us can help us be more willing and able to rise to the challenges we are faced with in meaningful ways. Practitioners might spend some time with parents and suggest that they consider approaching their current context in a different way: See if you can step back for a moment and imagine that you could choose to make your time during this crisis about the things that are truly important and meaningful to you. If that were so, ask yourself, \u201cWho do I want to be during this crisis? What do I want this to be about? What would it look like if I acted toward my values?\u201d Practitioners may remind parents that every moment offers a choice and that in every moment parents can choose how best to use this time. This moment can be all about crisis parenting, or it could be about something more meaningful or valued.

In addition, practitioners may encourage parents to make a promise to themselves about something that really matters and start small: \u201cDo the hard stuff in whatever order you like\u201d and keep going. \u201cPractice everywhere, everywhen, everyhow, everymood, with everyone. Don\u2019t stop\u201d (Sedley & Coyne, 2020: p. 71). In doing so, practitioners may create a space for this crisis to be incredibly scary and difficult, but also meaningful and important.

Perhaps take a moment and check in with your body, and ask it if it needs anything. Is there something you could do right now to feel just 10% more comfortable? We might then invite parents to find just one moment, every day, to put down whatever they are doing and do something kind for themselves, even if that is simply allowing themselves to think about and focus on something other than all of this, just for a moment. Self-kindness could even be shaped within session, perhaps starting with just pausing the session and encouraging parents to breathe into whatever they are experiencing, with kindness, before carrying on.",
