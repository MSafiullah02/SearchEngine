Reports of cases in China were mostly\nrestricted to Hubei until 23rd January 2020 (81% of all cases), after\nwhich most provinces reported rapid increases in cases (Fig. 1a). We built a line list dataset from reported cases in\nChina with information on travel history and demographic characteristics (8). We note that the majority\nof early cases (before 23rd January 2020, Materials and Methods) reported\noutside of Wuhan had known travel history to Wuhan (57%) and were distributed across\nChina (Fig. 1b), highlighting the importance of\nWuhan as a major source of early cases. However, initial testing was focused mainly\non travelers from Wuhan, potentially biasing estimates of travel related infections\nupwards (Materials and Methods). Among cases known to have traveled from Wuhan\nbefore 23rd January 2020, the time from symptom onset to confirmation was\n6.5 days (SD: 4.2; fig. S2), providing opportunity for onward transmission at the\ndestination. More active surveillance reduced this interval to 4.8 days (SD: 3.03;\nfig. S2) for those who travelled after 23rd January 2020.",

Since infection events are typically not directly\nobserved, we estimate incubation period from the span of exposure during which\ninfection likely occurred.

S8). Therefore cases exported from Wuhan prior to the\ncordon sanitaire appear to have contributed to initiating local chains of\ntransmission, both in neighboring provinces (e.g., Henan) and in more distant\nprovinces, (e.g., Guangdong and Zhejiang; Figs.\n1a and 2b). Further, the frequency\nof introductions from Wuhan are also predictive of the size of the early epidemic in\nother provinces (controlling for population size) and thus the probability of large\noutbreaks (fig.

We plot the relative\nimprovement in the prediction of our model (based on normalized residual error) of\n(i) a model that includes daily mobility from Wuhan and (ii) a model that includes\ntesting availability (see more details in Materials and Methods). Overall, the\ninclusion of mobility data from Wuhan produces a significant improvement in the\nmodel\u2019s prediction (delta-BIC > 250, (20)) over a naive model that considers only\nautochthonous transmission with a doubling time of 2-8 days (Fig. 3b). Of the 27 provinces in China reporting cases through\nFebruary 6th, 2020, we find that in 12 provinces the largest improvements\nin prediction can be achieved using mobility only (fig. S5). In 10 provinces, both\ntesting and mobility improve the model\u2019s prediction, and in only one province\n(Hunan) is testing the most important factor improving model prediction (fig.
