This type of viruses, which was discovered and characterized in 1965, is broadly distributed in mammals and birds. In humans, the majority of the coronaviruses cause only mild respiratory infections and a limited number, such as the \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d (SARS) in China (Liu et al. 2004) and the \u201cMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome\u201d (MERS) in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, have caused more than 10,000 cumulative infected cases in the past 2 decades. Although several coronaviruses have been identified and characterized, additional unknown coronaviruses that are potential threats are to be discovered.",

            "text": "In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown reasons emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and one of the largest cities in the central part of China. Although the majority of them were cured, they led to respiratory failures and a few patient fatalities. This outbreak of pneumonia attracted significant attention in the world. The causative agent identified by the Chinese authorities was designated 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Heath Organization (WHO) on January 10 2020. On January 20 2020, the Chinese government classified the novel 2019-nCoV as a class A agent. A series of non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented, namely, isolation of symptomatic persons, strict restriction of travel in Hubei province and shutdown of the public transport in various cities. Although the number of the accumulative confirmed patients (NACP) in the non-Hubei Chinese regions have decreased continually for 7 days, the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions is questionable. In addition, when the viral infection reaches its plateau phases several factors are affected including financial costs and work abstention. Therefore, it is very crucial to reduce the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV. So far, there are nearly 20,000 confirmed cases in Wuhan and more than 40,000 confirmed cases in China, whereas several exported cases have been confirmed in other countries including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UK and Spain. Mathematical models were employed to investigate the viral outbreak and interesting results were obtained. The mathematical modeling of the 2019 n-CoV outbreak has been previously investigated (Chen et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020; Rabajante 2020; Imai et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Fanelli and Piazza 2020; Peng et al. 2020; Toda 2020; Sameni 2020). The reason of the outbreak has bee reported in previous studies (Chu et al. 2020; Khan et al. 2020a, b). Its clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were also studied (Qian et al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020). Its treatment and prognosis were presented in two recent studies (Chen and Du 2020; Chai et al. 2020). Its containment strategy was discussed in (Bittihn and Golestanian 2020; Hu et al. 2020). The prediction of the tendency of 2019-nCoV and notably of the NACP and of the plateau phase is of great importance at present. These goals were achieved by fitting the data of the NACP in these regions. The 2019-nCoV outbreak could not be modeled accurately due to the weak knowledge of the reasons, transmission mechanisms, effect of control policies, treatments strategies and damages. The mechanism of 2019-nCoV infection is very unclear and was studied by several scientists. However, the data contains its much information and can disclose its many natures. Therefore, these data were fitted in order to conduct the outbreak prediction. Two significant features were stated in my novel fitting method as follows:The first novel idea is the choice of the data of the NACP in different regions. For the China regions outside Hubei Province, i.e., the non-Hubei part, the medical conditions are sufficient and the isolation policy is well executed. All the confirmed patients can be collected and receive treatment, and the suspected cases can be collected for diagnosis and further treatment. Therefore, the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is just a general epidemic. For Hubei Province, which includes the Wuhan City, several cabin hospitals and the Leishenshan hospital were employed following initial completeness of the Huoshenshan Hospital. The majority of the confirmed patients can be collected for treatment and most suspected patients can also be collected for diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Therefore, the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City and Hubei Province are considered as a general epidemic and can be treated as such. The data were collected from the non-Hubei part of China from approximately January 20 2020, i.e., from the beginning of the policy of isolation to the present day. The data were collected from Hubei Province and from Wuhan City from February 6 2020, i.e., from the date of the initial establishment of the Huoshenshan hospital, to the present date. The data can be fitted to predict the NACP in the short-term duration and predict the initiation of the plateau phases.The selection of the basic functions for the fitting model is crucial for the success of the prediction. Since in both the above cases, the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic, this suggests that it will initially spread rapidly and subsequently exhibit a tendency to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical locations will initially increase rapidly and subsequently remain constant when reaching the plateau phase of the viral infection. In the present study, the hyperbolic tangent functions \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tanh (.)$$\\end{document}tanh(.) were used that can satisfy the aforementioned conditions. Therefore, the hyperbolic tangent function \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\tanh (.)$$\\end{document}tanh(.) was set as the basic function for fitting. It laid the foundation of the success of the fitting model and further enhanced the prediction success of the 2019-nCoV infection.By this novel method, two significant results were obtained based on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical locations in China were predicted very accurately in the short term period of infection. Moreover, the times of the plateau phases were determined in different places in the long-term period of infection. Generally, in the non-Hubei China part, the NACP of 2019-nCoV will tend to constant from approximately February 23 2020 and its maximum infectivity will be theoretically achieved by March 30 2020. Following this date, no additional infected patient will be expected to be diagnosed. Based on the present results, it is suggested that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed continually.",

After this point, the infectious disease will be controlled and the majority of the confirmed patients will recover, whereas a low number of cases will succumb to the disease. The prediction of this point is of great importance to the inhibition of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In the present study, the prediction of IPs in the 2019-nCoV outbreak in different regions of China is presented (Figs. 11, 12, 13 and Tables 6, 7, 8, 9). These regions are usually important cities or the main affected regions around Hubei province. It is of great importance to investigate the date of the 2019-nCoV termination. It is very helpful for the prevention of 2019-nCoV outbreak to construct a plan for their daily life, returning to work and resuming production by the government. It can be deduced that the cities in the mainland China outside of Hubei Province should be able to control the outbreak of 2019-nCoV before March 30 2020 and after this date no confirmed patient should be reported. The nearby regions, especially the severe outbreak regions, such as Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui Provinces, the important industrial and financial regions, such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu Provinces and the important international cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai are also predicted in Figs. 11, 12, 13 and Tables 6, 7, 8, 9. Since the medical conditions and curative efficiency are being improved, the NACP of Hubei Province and Wuhan City can not represent the real number of the infected subjects. Thus, the NACP or IP can not be predicted effectively. But in this paper, I have tried to predict the NACPs and IPs for Wuhan City and Hubei Province. The results of NACPs are excellent also and presented in Tables 10, 11 and 12. The results for IPs in these two regions are presented in Fig. 13\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$(y-z)$$\\end{document}(y-z) and Table 6.",

The data were collected during different time periods of infection occurring in different regions of China to ensure that as many as possible confirmed and suspected cases could be collected for diagnosis or treatment. The hyperbolic tangent functions were used as the basic functions for the fitting method. Two significant results were obtained as follows: Firstly, the NACP could be predicted very accurately in different regions of China, notably in Wuhan City and Hubei Province with very small relative errors. In the non-Hubei region of China larger relative errors were noted in the short-term period of infection. Secondly, the time point at which the plateau phases occur can be predicted in different regions in the long-run period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei Chinese regions, the plateau phase of 2019-nCoV was noted at approximately March 30 2020 and after this time period no new confirmed patients were identified. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points (IPs) and maximum NACP for certain important regions were also presented. These measures are very important for the prevention of the 2019-nCoV outbreak and for returning to work and resuming production in their daily life and work duties in China. Based on these results, it is suggested that the rigorous isolation policy should be executed by the government continually during the daily life and that as many as possible confirmed and suspected cases should be collected for diagnosis or treatment.",
