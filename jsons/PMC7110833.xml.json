The major cause of this upsurge is attributable to an explosive increase in HIV infections among intravenous drug users (IDU), from 112 total cases (2.15% of all cases) at the end of 2003 to 5034 (38.42%) by the end of 2006, a 45-fold increase within 3 years.",

It has been speculated that the source of this outbreak was a drug-trafficking route to Taiwan from Yunnan Province via southeast China, Guangxi Province, and Hong Kong,6, 7, 8 from where a substantial amount of heroin was being smuggled into Taiwan. Moreover, five IDUs from southern Taiwan were diagnosed as the country's first HIV-1-seropositive cases infected with CRF07_BC in 2002.2, 3 The total number of female HIV/AIDS cases nearly tripled between 2003 and 2005, from 320 female HIV/AIDS cases by January of 2003 to 903 cases by January 2006. The male-to-female ratio of HIV/AIDS cases was 13:1 before 2003 but declined to 7:1 in 2005\u20132006, with most of the newly reported female cases being IDUs.4 The cumulative number of infected female IDUs increased by 40-fold, from 16 cases at the end of 2003 to 648 by the end of 2006.",

In Taiwan, where needle-sharing or apparatus-sharing behaviors have been found to be common among IDUs, the majority of newly diagnosed HIV/IDUs were detected through mandatory inmate screening upon entry to correctional facilities. However, mandatory HIV screening of persons under police custody due to violation of the Narcotics Control Act since late 2004 could also have partially contributed to the sharp increase in detection.",

A recent molecular epidemiology study after the CRF07_BC outbreak in Taiwan concluded that while the percentage of CRF07_BC among all HIV infections decreased from 2007 to 2009, the percentage of subtype B actually increased.11 However, many questions remain regarding this sudden outbreak among the IDU population.",

            "text": "To determine the correlation between the epidemic among the male and female IDUs through their time series of monthly case numbers, a distributed lag model (DLM) was employed to describe the relationship between the male and female time series. A DLM is a regression model that includes current and lagged values of one or more explanatory variables. This model allows the determination of what the effects are for a change in a time series. The resulting correlation coefficient, r, is a useful measure of linear strength between two random variables. The mathematical formula for computing r is:r=\u03a3((x\u2212x\u00af)(y\u2212y\u00af))\u03a3(x\u2212x\u00af)2\u03a3(y\u2212y\u00af)2=\u03a3xy\u2212(\u03a3x)(\u03a3y)n[\u03a3x2\u2212(\u03a3x)2n][\u03a3y2\u2212(\u03a3y)2n]=n\u03a3xy\u2212(\u03a3x)(\u03a3y)n(\u03a3x2)\u2212(\u03a3x)2n\u03a3y2\u2212(\u03a3y)2,where n is the number of pairs of data. The value of r is such that \u22121 \u2264 r \u2264 + 1. The \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs are used for positive linear correlations and negative linear correlations, respectively. If there is no linear correlation or a weak linear correlation, r is close to 0. A value near zero means that there is a random, nonlinear relationship between the two variables. \u2018|r| \u2264 0.4\u2019 means \u2018low correlation\u2019, \u20180.4 < |r| \u2264 0.7\u2019 means \u2018moderate correlation\u2019, and \u2018|r| > 0.7\u2019 means \u2018high correlation\u2019.

After 1 year of the pilot study, data indicated that the HIV incidence in cities with an NSP decreased from 13.9 to 13.3 per 100 000 persons compared to an incidence increase from 11.5 to 15.3 per 100 000 persons in cities without an NSP.26 Subsequently, the harm reduction program was expanded to the whole of Taiwan in July 2006.

Therefore, the minimum p-value at a lag of 2 months for both the time series of case numbers and the first differences of the time series suggests that the strongest causality relationship, of male infections causing female infections, was within 2 months, a rather immediate relationship that led to the sudden upsurge in reported female HIV/IDU cases shortly after the upsurge of the male IDU cases in early 2004. It also indicates that there is likely some needle-sharing or apparatus-sharing among and between male and female IDUs, although one cannot rule out the possibility of sexual contact between the male and female IDUs, since one study25 in Taiwan found that 99.1% of the HIV-infected IDUs participating in the study were heterosexual. Unfortunately no data on any relationships that might exist between the reported cases were available.

            "text": "In summary, the abrupt outbreak among IDUs in Taiwan in 2004\u20132007, which was caused by the recently introduced CRF07_BC recombinant, led to two waves of infection with increasing transmissibility as measured by the effective reproduction number R during each wave, suggesting the presence of a small first wave in 2004 before the explosion of cases after May 2005. This further demonstrates the future potential of real-time modeling and analysis of disease data27 as part of a disease surveillance system, which could conceivably detect and alert the authorities of a possible herald wave before the arrival of a major outbreak. The waves ended by March 2007, which could be attributable to a timely and effective harm reduction program implemented in August 2005; this has been essential in preventing further occurrences of wide-spread infections among IDUs in Taiwan since 2007. Furthermore, the infections among male IDUs led to the epidemic among the female IDUs, a population that had previously been mostly devoid of HIV infections.",

In this study, the data that were used spanned a period of roughly 3 years, during which time the explosive outbreak among IDUs emerged; this subsequently led to interventions that included wider testing of IDUs in Taiwan and the harm reduction program. Moreover, while the simple mathematical model that was employed was able to reveal the temporal progression, culmination, and conclusion of the outbreak, it was unable to further pinpoint the exact impact of these intervention measures on the outbreak, which would require much more detailed data on the reported cases as well as a far more complicated mathematical model.",
