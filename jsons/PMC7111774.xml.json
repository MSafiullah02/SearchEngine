            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a lethal disease of cats caused by a hypervirulent variant of feline coronavirus (FCoV), an alphacoronavirus that usually causes self-limiting infections of the intestinal epithelium, leading to mild or no gastroenteric signs (Addie et al., 2009). Two different FCoV genotypes are currently known, FCoV type I (FCoV-I) and type II (FCoV-II), both involved in the occurrence of mild gastroenteritis or fatal FIP (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011). FIP is a perivascular pyogranulomatosis that may occur in two clinical forms, effusive and non-effusive FIP, which are characterized by prevalence of effusions in the body cavities and of pyogranulomatous lesion in organs, respectively. FIP diagnosis is challenging since the \u2018gold standard\u2019 is the post-mortem demonstration of FCoV antigens in tissues by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, alternative tools are commonly used for the intra-vitam diagnosis. Haematological and biochemical analyses can support a presumptive diagnosis of FIP, but they usually require further investigations, such as assessment of the FCoV antibody titres and molecular detection of FCoV RNA in the effusions (effusive form) or bioptic samples (non-effusive FIP) from ill cats. Unfortunately, both methods lack specificity and sensitivity, thus often leading to an inconclusive diagnosis (Addie et al., 2009). Recently, a comparison between the intra-vitam detection of FCoV antibodies and that of FCoV RNA in the effusions of cats with confirmed FIP has been carried out, showing a trend toward negative or low antibody levels in cats with high viral RNA titres (Meli et al., 2013). However, these findings have not been confirmed by other studies.",

Infected cells were fixed in acetone 100% and twofold dilutions of the effusion (starting from dilution 1:100 to 1:51,200) were tested. Goat anti-cat IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was used as secondary antibody solution (Sigma Aldrich srl). The assay was proven to detect both FCoV-I and FCoV-II antibodies (Addie and Jarrett, 1992, Campolo et al., 2005). Effusion with qRT-PCR positive and IIF-negative results were treated with ammonium thiocyanate to dissociate immune complexes, as previously described (Pullen et al., 1986, Macdonald et al., 1988).",

FCoV reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (FCoV qRT-PCR) was performed as previously described (Gut et al., 1999), with minor modifications. In brief, a one-step method was adopted using Platinum\u00ae Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen srl, Milan, Italy) and the following 50-\u03bcl mixture: 25 \u03bcl of master mix, 300 nM of primers FcoV1128f (GATTTGATTTGGCAATGCTAGATTT) and FcoV1229r (AACAATCACTAGATCCAGACGTTAGCT), 200 nM of probe FCoV1200p (FAM- TCCATTGTTGGCTCGTCATAGCGGA-BHQ1) and 10 \u03bcl of template RNA. The employed oligonucleotides bind to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (Gut et al., 1999). The thermal profile consisted of incubation with UDG at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min and activation of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 48 \u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s.

FIP cannot be differentiated from an FCoV enteric infection based on serology because the antibodies are directed against the same pathogen and there are no relevant antigenic differences between the enteric and hypervirulent strains. It is recognised that FIP-ill cats have very high antibody titres in their serum and effusions due to the systemic spreading of the virus through the infected monocytes/macrophages (Addie et al., 2009). However, detection of high antibody titres alone is not a confirmatory test. In addition, the absence of specific antibodies or the presence of very low antibody titres has been recently demonstrated in the effusions of cats with confirmed FIP, likely due to antibody sequestration by the high number of viral particles in the same sample of some cats (Meli et al., 2013). Hartmann et al. (2003) demonstrated that about 10% of cats with FIP tested seronegative for FCoV. However, in that study a transmissible gastroenteritis virus strain was used as antigen, which could affect the sensitivity of FCoV-antibody testing (Giori et al., 2011). Accordingly, FCoV antibody titres were found to dramatically drop in terminal cases of FIP (Pedersen, 1995). This phenomenon is not restricted to FIP, but it has been also demonstrated for other viral infections characterized by high-level virus replication (Quir\u00f3s-Rold\u00e1n et al., 2000, Guihot et al., 2014). Overall, detection of FCoV antibodies in the effusions is affected by poor specificity and sensitivity.",

Here, we have analysed by the same methods the effusions of 61 cats with suspected FIP, thus including also potential samples from animals with non-FIP related diseases. Accordingly, using an IIF antibody titre of 1:1600 as a cut-off, 5 samples tested negative by both IIF and qRT-PCR assays, possibly accounting for diseases other than FIP, while 21 effusions gave contrasting results (low-titre or no antibodies in the presence of FCoV RNA or viceversa). These 21 samples with conflicting results are likely to be true positive since an IIF-negative result could be related to antibody sequestration by high viral loads (Meli et al., 2013). In addition, Addie et al. (2015) demonstrated that up to 43% antibody-positive effusions from FIP cases were negative for FCoV RNA, likely as a consequence of PCR inhibition by interfering substances or RNA degradation during sample transportation and storage. However, in the absence of alternative diagnosis, even those 5 cats with neither FCoV antibodies nor RNA in their effusions could not be definitively considered as non-FIP animals (Addie et al., 2015). Unfortunately, clinical cases were mostly untraceable and confirmatory necropsy was not done in any case, so that the lack of confirmatory testing represents the main limitation of the present study.",

Using this diagnostic approach, only 6 out of 61 cats whose effusions were analysed would be considered FIP negative, even if also in these cases FIP could not be completely ruled out (Meli et al., 2013). Thus, the combined serological and molecular protocol should improve the ability of laboratories to diagnose effusive FIP, especially if the test results are supported by clinical and haematological findings. However, intra-vitam diagnosis of non-effusive FIP still remains highly inconclusive, even if recent studies tried to address this issue (Doenges et al., 2016). Therefore, future studies are needed to develop and validate tools for the intra-vitam diagnosis of non-effusive FIP, which still represents a challenge for veterinary diagnosticians.",
