In addition, our approach keeps track of context -an important challenge in SQA -by allowing users to make their focus explicit via subgraph selection. Our results show that the interaction principle is either understood immediately or picked up very quickly -and that the possibility of exploring the information space iteratively is appreciated.",

Its main assumption is that users do not simply ask a question to a knowledge base and then quit. Instead, users tend to break down complex questions into a series of simple questions [5] . In addition, as known from exploratory search [12] , users who do not have a very clearly articulated information need and/or who aim at getting familiar with a new field of knowledge tend to ask series of questions where one answer triggers the next question. That is, a user might ask a rather \"fuzzy\" first question (such as \"what are important topics in the field of 'Information Retrieval' ?\") and then -when studying the answer -start to think of new questions, concerning some of the new concepts found in that answer. Although the concept of exploratory search is well known from the field of information retrieval, this exploratory motivation for performing sequential question answering (over structured knowledge bases) has not been studied so far. In any case, sequential question answering raises the major challenge of keeping track of context: since they assume the context to be known from the prior questions and answers, users tend to leave away sentence elements [14] .",

An obvious drawback of these supervised learning approaches -as opposed to earlier hand-crafted rule-based grammars -is the amount of training data required.

This new focus on interactive, dialog-driven access to knowledge bases is based on the insight that users rarely pose a question to such a knowledge base and then quit [3, 14] . Instead, a more common and natural access pattern consists in posing a series of questions. Most researchers in SQA assume that the motivation for dialogs comes from the need to decompose complex questions into simple ones [5, 14] . Some researchers propose to perform such decomposition algorithmically [15] , while others provide evidence that it is more natural and realistic to assume that humans will like to perform this decomposition themselves, resulting in a series of simple, but inter-related questions [5] . A key challenge in any form of sequential or conversational question answering is the resolution of ellipses (e.g. omissions of arguments in relations) or anaphora which are very frequent in a dialogue where the user expects the system to keep track of the context [5, 9, 14] .",

This means that parsers can be extended to find new types of nodes and relationships and/or cover new data sources of known type, without the need to modify the program code of the parser. Typically, the specifications for various data sources have overlapping node types, thus resulting in a data integration task.

Our results are somewhat limited by the specific scenario and use case that we explored and the small user group involved.

Having to explicitly select context is hard to get used to for some, and should be automated. The visual representation of results was well received for its support of understanding relationships.
