Fig. 1 A 57- year-old female with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had dyspnea one week after onset of symptoms of fever and diarrhea. Under high-flow oxygen inhalation, her pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) was only 60%; thus, invasive ventilation was used with fraction of inspired oxygen 50-70% to maintain SPO2 around 95%. On Feb. 21, she underwent the first mobile X-ray, which indicated extensive pneumonia. Compared with initial X-ray, significant progress could be seen in the follow-up X-ray on Feb. 24, which was a typical \"white lung.\" A new intrapulmonary cavity was revealed by the second X-ray, and was significantly larger in the third X-ray on Mar. 1.
