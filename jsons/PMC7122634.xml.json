In the most severe cases the mortality of ALF without transplantation ranges from 10 to 90%; in recent years, survival has improved to around 40\u201390% [3]. This is related to improved critical care management, better prognostic assessment, and the timely prioritisation of patients for liver transplantation (LT). The management of ALF is focused on the support of all organ systems and the prevention and treatment of complications, particularly sepsis. Liver necrosis acts as a focus of inflammation, driving vasoplegia and leading to cardiovascular collapse, which exacerbates dysfunction of other vital organs, particularly the kidney and brain. The identification and treatment of the cause of the underlying liver injury should be the primary goal, with a concurrent focus on the optimization of the circulation to promote hepatocellular regeneration and to prevent further insult due to ischemic injury. However, despite such endeavours timely recognition that hepatic regeneration will ultimately not be sufficient is crucial. Liver transplantation with removal of the necrotic liver mass offers the best chance of survival. The decision to prioritise for transplantation requires a multidisciplinary team approach incorporating specialist liver transplant surgeons, hepatologist, and intensivists who can utilize established prognostic criteria along with the daily assessment of the levels of organ support to best determine which patients are likely to benefit from being listed for transplant with high priority and indeed proceeding to OLT if levels of organ support permit (Fig. 2.2) [4].\n",

These patients are then stratified by blood group and time while on the super-urgent waiting list. In most cases a donor organ should be available within 48\u201372 h. Occasionally the option of an ABO incompatible donor organ has to be considered in light of the unavailability of an ABO compatible organ weighed against the projected deterioration of the clinical condition. It is widely accepted that the currently available selection criteria are imperfect with up to 10\u201320% of patients surviving without a transplant. The option of an auxiliary transplant graft is sometimes considered as it allows native regeneration and withdrawal of immunosuppression, but due to the increased risk of early postoperative complications it necessitates careful scrutiny of appropriate potential candidates.\n",

The two most commonly used definitions concentrate on the time period from jaundice to the onset of encephalopathy [1]. This classification is important, because the hyperacute forms of ALF including acetominophen overdose and Hepatitis A are associated with mortality due to cerebral edema and kidney injury. However survival without transplantation for this group is superior to the more indolent subacute causes, including sero-negative and idiosyncratic drug reactions that are not as frequently complicated by the cerebral and renal insults, but carry a higher mortality burden compared with hyperacute causes (Table 2.1).",

In 1998 the Medicine Control Agency in the UK sought to limit the availability of \u00adparacetamol. Legislation was changed in line with World Health Organisation recommendations and data from other countries with similar restrictive policies that had lower rates of paracetamol-induced hepatoxicity. Suicidal or para-suicidal actions are usually impulsive acts in reaction to crises; therefore, it was postulated that limiting supply would result in reduced availability of paracetamol, thus reducing the quantity ingested and lowering rates of hepatoxicity. The general sale of paracetamol was restricted to 16 500 mg tablets, a total of 8 g per packet. Studies have sought to demonstrate whether these restrictions have indeed been associated with a reduction in admissions to hospital and liver units, and in the need for liver transplantation. However, both short follow up periods and a diverse range of outcomes evaluated have hampered these studies in quantifying any change with certainty. Despite this, there is a trend towards an overall reduction of paracetamol-related hepatoxicity and hospital admissions following the change in legislation [6].",

Due to a combination of the small doses absorbed and the efficacy of early antidote \u00adtherapy, only 0.6% of these cases result in hepatoxicity in the UK. Studies assessing the rate of deliberate vs. accidental POD display geographic variation. In Europe, studies have reported around 86% of POD cases were deliberate and 14% were accidental [8], while US poisons centre data have reported rates of 35% and 65%, respectively [9]. Additionally, paracetamol medications combined with narcotics have been shown to pose a potential for unintentional hepatoxicity when addiction to the narcotic within such combined analgesics leads to a gradual increase of the ingested dose [2]. There has been the suggestion that this is a significant reason for the discrepancy between the US and the UK with regard to deliberate and unintentional overdose. The assessment of the risk of developing ALF from POD, whether accidental or deliberate, is closely related to the total dose ingested, as well as the time from ingestion to presentation and treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC).",

NAC acts to augment the glutathione reserves in the body, which directly bind to toxic metabolites and protect hepatocytes in the liver from NAPQI toxicity.

In a staggered overdose the paracetamol level cannot be interpreted and one must assess the risk of hepatoxicity based on dose alone.

This exposes the liver to the potential toxicity of many drugs. In the US, hepatoxicity is the main cause for halting drug development and withdrawal from the market. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) including cases of acetominophen toxicity, is the leading cause of ALF and indication for liver transplantation. The remainder of DILI cases are idiosyncratic reaction, which occur in around 1 in 10,000 of exposed patients. However, more than 1,000 drugs and herbal remedies have been implicated in DILI and altogether comprise 10% of ALF cases [13]. Idiosyncratic DILI is a complex \u00adphenomenon, which appears to be integrally related to how cell mitochondria balance cellular injury and regeneration. Idiosyncrasy defines the unpredictable and non-dose dependant fashion with which liver injury can occur. There are nonallergic and allergic idiosyncratic DILI, the latter characterised by fever, skin reactions, eosinophilia with the formation of autoantibodies, one such example is drug-related eosinophilic syndrome (DRESS). Several risk factors for DILI have been identified and include age, female gender, concomitant diseases, and drugs. There are DILI algorithms and clinical scales that can be used to improve the consistency, accuracy of causality of adverse drug reactions [14].",

A literature review in 2005 cited 34 cases of primary and metastatic neoplastic infiltration of the liver resulting in ALF [15]. The pathophysiology of ALF in neoplastic infiltration is multifactorial. Parenchymal ischemia and infarction can be caused by diffuse tumour cell infiltration or vascular occlusion from tumour thrombi. It has also been postulated that diffuse tumour cell infiltration renders the remaining liver parenchyma highly susceptible to ischemic injury. A case series of three patients with metastatic disease \u00addemonstrated biopsy-proven hepatic ischemia, which was in the absence of any discernable episode of systemic hypotension [15, 16]. Additionally, cytokine-mediated liver injury has been implicated in lymphomatous infiltration [17]. Clinical suspicion and features suggestive of malignancy such as enlarged lymph nodes on physical examination along with computer tomography (CT) findings suggestive of an infiltrative process should prompt an attempt to obtain a biopsy for a definitive histological diagnosis. Furthermore, radiological imaging including both ultrasonography and triple phase computer tomography should not be relied on due to the poor sensitivity for metastatic and lymphomatous infiltration of the liver. The only serum markers of tumour infiltration are alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST), though elevation of these is usually below levels seen in ischemic hepatitis. Both appear to have greater sensitivity in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia. However, jaundice does not always manifest in the setting of tumour infiltration with cases of over 90% liver infiltration without jaundice in the literature. A trans-jugular liver, bone marrow aspiration, and trephine or lymph node biopsy can all prove to be invaluable tools for establishing a diagnosis. The diagnosis of malignancy is a clear contraindication for liver transplantation and establishing the diagnosis therefore crucial.",

The incidence of WD is around 1 in 30,000 and can present acutely, usually in pediatric or young female patients, or chronically in adult patients sometimes into their eighth decade of life. ALF in WD is unique in so far as there is usually some degree of preexisting liver disease at the time when ALF ensues. WD is diagnosed by measuring indices of copper metabolism, although in ALF these investigations can be misleadingly normal. Serum copper and caeruloplasmin, as an acute phase protein, can both be normal or elevated in other causes of ALF. Elevated levels of urinary copper are a good indicator of WD, but the high incidence of anuric acute kidney injury in ALF can extinguish the availability of this diagnostic tool. Ophthalmic interrogation of corneas can be useful to detect the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which together with evidence of liver disease and copper metabolism abnormalities strongly support the case for the diagnosis. Additionally, Coomb\u2019s negative hemolytic anemia and low serum cholinesterase levels can be a feature of WD [20]. The ALP/bilirubin and aspartate AST/bilirubin ratios are often significantly lower in fulminant Wilson\u2019s disease than in other categories of fulminant liver failure, but distinction between diagnostic categories on this basis is not possible [21].",

Investigations should include those for: hepatitis and atypical viral serology; autoantibodies, such as antinuclear, anti smooth muscle, anti-liver kidney microsomal, anti-soluble liver antigen, anti-mitochondrial antibodies; an illicit drugs screen, paracetamol levels; and urine and serum copper. A negative paracetamol level does not rule out paracetamol as a cause of ALF. Additionally, ultrasonography of the liver and its vasculature is important. Where possible, if the history and investigations do not suggest a viral or drug-induced insult, axial imaging with computer tomography is advisable. Patient outcomes are largely determined by the severity of the underlying liver insult and the development of organ failure and episodes of sepsis have a strong impact on mortality. Early recognition and treatment of sepsis and the prevention and support of organ dysfunction is therefore key to increasing the potential for hepatic regeneration. Finally, a timely decision regarding super-urgent liver transplantation is required when it becomes sufficiently clear that hepatic regeneration will not occur. This decision carries particular importance given that the median time from listing to transplantation is around 48 h. Consequently, 24% of patients listed will fail to proceed to transplantation with 92% of these patients dying [22]. Those that are not transplanted have a median time from listing to death of 2 days (2\u20134), with several pre-transplant factors associated with poor outcomes such as age <45 and escalating vasopressor requirement [22]. There are several other factors that should prompt discussion regarding the suitability to proceed to transplantation. These include fixed dilated pupils for greater than 2 h, necrotizing pancreatitis, severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, culture proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring more than 24 h of antimicrobial therapy before transplantation. All these conditions need to be evaluated in relation to age and the degree of associated organ failures.",

The SSC threshold for lactate is 4 mmol/L; in ALF this is unlikely to reflect sole circulatory disarray, but it should be assumed to be so until adequate volume resuscitation has been implemented. Hyperlactemia broadly reflects liver, circulatory and cellular dysfunction, although the liver does have large reserves for lactate metabolism. The normal lactate levels encountered after hepatectomy with more than 50% of the liver resected supports this [23]. However, high circulating blood lactate levels are frequently encountered in ALF where inadequate fluid resuscitation has lead to circulatory and cellular metabolism dysfunction. Overall hyperlactemia and the speed of resolution acts as an important predictor of outcome in both critical illness and ALF [24]. It is now recognised as an important prognostic variable.

The diagnosis and treatment of RAI in critical illness was first encountered in sepsis with the demonstration that low dose hydrocortisone could accelerate the reversal of shock, despite a lack of significant mortality benefit [29]. The high prevalence of RAI in ALF can be explained by factors that affect cortisol metabolism. Firstly, both ALF and sepsis often coexist and ALF represents an additional stress that can lead to RAI. Secondly, patients with ALF have low circulating cortisol levels for several reasons: the effects of low levels of HDL cholesterol that is central to cortisol production, increased conversion of cortisol to the inactive form cortisone and the negative effect of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) on hypothalamic function all contribute to the low circulating TC levels [30].",

Therefore, to improve interpretation various alternative measures or calculations have been explored to better assess FC levels. The use of salivary cortisol has been shown to correlate well with FC, although in ventilated patients this may be difficult to obtain. Alternatively, the free cortisol index (see equation below) can be calculated by measuring both CBG and TC levels, which has also been shown to correlate well with FC levels [31]. These alternative measures of FC may prove to be better methods of assessing RAI rather than relying on TC levels alone.

A significant proportion of patients will also develop a spectrum of respiratory complications. Acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS complicate up to 30% of paracetamol-induced ALF cases [33]. It affects primarily those with significant vasopressor requirements and evidence of intracranial hypertension (ICH). The mechanisms involved of ALI in ALF include the directly toxic effects of acetominophen and the pathophysiological overlap of changes involving vasoactive mediators that affect not only the brain and circulation, but also the lung with increased vascular permeability and capillary leak. This is further exacerbated by the additional fluid accumulation within extravascular compartments, due to large cumulative volumes of fluid administered to support the vasoplegic circulation. Additionally, there is a high incidence (around 51%) of cultured tracheal aspirates with gram-negative organisms in intubated ALF patients [34], which has a direct impact on the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia and ALI. Hepatic encephalopathy and ICH are also implicated in the development of ALI. The risk of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sepsis and indeed ARDS are specifically associated with aspects of ICH management. These include deep sedation, induction and maintenance of hypothermia and limited endotrachial suction, which all contribute to limited tracheo-bronchial toilet and retention of secretions. In ALF commonly encountered respiratory complication associated with both mechanical ventilation and critical illness have been described. These include pleural effusions, atelectasis, and poor compliance due to raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) or reduced \u00adthoracic compliance due to chest wall edema.",

A balanced approach is often required, though low tidal volumes (6\u20138 mL/kg) can achieve normal partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) in most cases. Increased IAP and decreased lung compliance due to chest wall edema lead to increases in pleural pressure, rendering the plateau pressure a poor measure of transpulmonary pressure. Therefore, attempts to limit plateau pressure below 30 cm water can be difficult to attain and indeed are often unnecessary. The combination of ALI/ARDS with severely elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) with intact physiological autoregulation necessitates tight control of pCO2. When all conventional measures aimed at increasing CO2 clearance have been exhausted extracorporeal CO2 clearance devices to facilitate control in pCO2 may be used. This should be a strategy of last resort due the significant potential for bleeding complications associated with cannulae insertion and limb ischemia. Such devices have been used successfully in traumatic brain injury cases and ARDS [35] and have also been employed on few occasions in ALF patients with developed ARDS post-OLT, when ICH has remained problematic (unreported).",

The adverse effect of high PEEP on ICH may be outweighed by the improvement of oxygenation and consequent improvement of cerebral blood flow. Recruitment maneuvers such as prone positioning are contraindicated due to the impact on ICH management. Hypoxemia and high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) can be reasons remove patients with ALF off the transplant waiting list. However, hypoxemia alone appears to be a nonspecific variable in the diagnosis of ALI. Furthermore, a low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio is common, but transient and not necessarily associated with poor outcomes [36]. Transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output monitors can calculate an estimated measure of lung permeability, the extravascular lung water index, which has been shown to be a useful variable in guiding management [37].",

An assessment of the recovery of ICP auto regulatory mechanisms can be achieved by evaluating ICP responses to enforced elevations in pCO2, mean arterial pressure and reductions in sedation. The return of ICP autoregulation permits a more sustained withdrawal of sedation and weaning from mandatory modes of ventilation. However, once sedation is decreased or stopped neurological problems may arise such as slow emergence from sedation or intensive care delirium. There is also a risk of both subclinical and clinical seizures likely related to ICH during ALF. Critical illness polymotorneuropathy (CIMPM) is also highly prevalent, due to the significant number of risk factors for this condition encountered in ALF, including sepsis, profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), exposure to steroids, high protein catabolism and MOF [38]. A (percutaneous) tracheostomy is often necessary to facilitate weaning from the ventilator and sedating medication.

The use of opioid-based sedation, aggressive fluid regimens causing bowel wall edema, raised IAP, and constipation all contribute to abnormalities of gut motility resulting in decreased absorption. If gut failure and poor absorption persist despite attention to constipation therapy and the use of prokinetics early intervention with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be warranted. Previous concerns about TPN-induced liver toxicity are not encountered with newer hypocalorific regimens [42]. Furthermore, there is currently no evidence suggesting that normal protein intake of approximately 1 g/kg/day worsens hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. This is important, because ALF patients are often catabolic with supranormal energy expenditure, despite significant hepatocyte loss. Furthermore there is significant protein catabolism with muscle wasting, amino acid losses, and vitamin deficiency, which all impact on immune function. This necessitates the supplementation of multiple vitamins and trace elements in patients with ALF, especially in those on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) regimen where losses are exacerbated [43, 44]. Hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered with CRRT, especially high volume regimens and requires prompt replacement. However, hypophosphatemia may also herald liver regeneration with increased hepatic ATP production and serve as a good prognostic marker [45].",

Additionally, both monocytes and macrophage have been implicated in the initiation, propagation, and resolution of acute liver injury. It appears that shortly after acute liver injury macrophages enthusiastically release chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This response is balanced by the initiation of anti-inflammatory responses accompanying the recruitment of monocytes to the site of the liver injury to initiate repair processes. Activated macrophages release TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates, and lysosomal enzymes. Bacterial products can also induce TNF-\u03b1 affecting microvascular permeability and further releases of IL-6.

The AKI staging utilizing the serum creatinine (SCr) criteria classifies increases greater than 300% from baseline as stage 3; in patients with previously normal kidney function (SCr 80\u2013120 \u03bcmol/L) this equates closely to the SCr of 300 \u03bcmol/L that is associated with poor prognosis in ALF. This is an important clinical criteria for referring to a specialist centre and listing patients for OLT (Tables 2.2 and 2.3).\n",

These vasoactive mediator-induced changes to the circulation cause heightened homeostatic responses involving the sympathetic nervous system and renin angiotensin system (RAS) culminating in arterial vasoconstriction in the kidney. The intraglomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction results in ischemic acute tubular necrosis that is now increasingly recognised as a complex interplay between endothelial dysfunction and leukocyte activation and release of cytokines causing profound intracellular oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent studies of hemodynamic changes in septic AKI suggest other microcirculatory changes, particularly renal venous congestion associated with disturbed cellular energy mechanisms independent of tissue oxygen availability [52].",

Evidence in support of this theory originates from rat models that demonstrate that NAC does not protect tubular cells [54]. Paracetamol is a phenacetin metabolite that has been implicated in proximal tubule cell apoptosis in AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Consequently, cellular mechanisms and the induction of apoptosis in renal tubular cells has been the focus of studies into paracetamol-induced nephrotoxicity. It seems likely that the mechanism for nephrotoxicity lies with endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase-mediated mechanisms that cause apoptosis [55]. Other speculated mechanisms include induction of oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Additionally, the role of prostaglandin synthetase and N-deacetylase enzymes have also been postulated to be involved [56]. Finally, it appears that glutathione, an important element in the detoxification of acetaminophen and its metabolites has paradoxically also been implicated in the formation of glutathione conjugates that are thought to be nephrotoxic.",

Numerous issues are associated with CRRT in patients with ALF, including the need for anticoagulation to extend filter life span. Despite the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia seen in ALF it has been demonstrated that CRRT circuits continue to clot as a result of losses of both pro- and anticoagulation factors [57]. Good vascular access, as well as an expanded intravascular compartment, is essential to extend filter life. Specific, yet standard maneuvers to extended filter life include the use of pre-dilution fluid replacement; high blood flows to reduce the ultrafiltration fraction, prompt attention to machine alarms, and use of prostacyclin anticoagulation. Prostacyclin has a half-life measured in seconds and represents a safe anticoagulant in ALF in the absence of hemorrhage. The use of heparin is not recommended during the initial presentation of ALF with evolving coagulopathy and citrate anticoagulation is complicated by the risk of citrate toxicity, due to the integral role of the liver in citrate metabolism. However, a case report of the safe use of a citrate-based dialysate, where heparin and regional citrate were contraindicated, demonstrating no signs of citrate toxicity intra-operatively during liver transplantation for a patient with paracetamol-induced ALF patient and AKI [58]. It is likely this was possible due to the low doses of citrate used (0.8 mmol/L; only about one-fifth of the concentration necessary to achieve anticoagulation) and the likely predominant role of muscle metabolising citrate. The role of citrate dialysate for RRT in ALF is, however, likely to be limited to short treatment periods and the intra-operative period and is not a common practice in the UK.",

The issues range from the mode, timing of initiation, indications for initiation; dose, anticoagulation use, and the perception that continuous replacement regimens are superior to intermittent regimens. There is, however, little compounding evidence available to clearly delineate any of these issues. Only the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) Replacement Therapy Study to date has endeavoured to answer and also establish some conclusions regarding the dose of ultrafiltration in AKI. No associated benefit was demonstrated with higher ultrafiltration doses of 40 mL/kg/h vs. lower rates of 25 mL/kg/h [59]. However, RRT often needs to be tailored to address the clinical fluctuations affecting fluid management and the profound metabolic disarray encountered. In ALF mortality is inextricably linked to the severity of the underlying liver insult. However, profound catabolism, hyperlactemia, SIRS, vasoplegia, and high vasopressor requirements often necessitate the use of pulse high volume hemofiltration (PHVH) at 60\u201390 mL/kg/h. PHVH has been shown in animal and clinical studies to effectively reduce vasopressor requirements, which in ALF patients can be valuable to prevent vasopressor-induced ischemic insults [60]. Although there is no proven mortality benefit, it does allow the effective management of episodes of deterioration often associated with sepsis limiting further hepatic damage.",

The half-life of factor VII is around 2 h, which implicates it as a good marker of synthetic liver function and the extent of hepatic necrosis. Factor V has itself too has been shown to be good prognostic indicator in Hepatitis B induced ALF [61]. However the assay of individual clotting factors is not routinely available. Consequently, there is continued reliance on the PT for prognostic assessment. In POD a PT of 36 s at 36 h after ingestion predicts 50% of patients will go on to develop ALF. Furthermore, a PT increasing on day 4 after ingestion and a peak PT of greater than 180 s is predictive of a 65% mortality [62].",

Importantly, the use of blood products containing clotting factors can have a significant impact on the interpretation of the PT and the assessment of prognosis, impending ALF and mortality. Blood products to correct coagulopathy should only be used when there is active bleeding or an invasive procedure beyond central and arterial line insertion, such as ICP bolt insertion or if transplantation is to be undertaken.

A retrospective analysis of patients with ALF who were medically managed between 1973 and 1985 was performed with the aim of identifying prognostically significant clinical parameters. The value of these parameters was then assessed, with the subsequent development of the King\u2019s College criteria (KCC), which have become the most widely used criteria for assessing prognosis in ALF. However, despite demonstrating high specificity for mortality without transplantation it has been widely accepted that the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the KCC are low. These criteria tend to fail to identify patients early enough in the clinical course of ALF or to predict those that will die without OLT. Furthermore, it has been reported that up to 25% of ALF cases survive without transplantation with a life expectancy of 13.4 years, which compares to 13.5 years with transplantation, though this falls to 8.1 years when adjusted for quality of life [63]. The impact of transplantation on quality of life is an important aspect of the decision-making process especially for those patients with POD, who may also have chronic psychiatric conditions predominate their lives. Ultimately, the combination of all these factors and the scarcity of donor organs have mandated an ongoing search for additional parameters that can predict prognosis earlier. Persistently elevated blood lactate has been closely associated with mortality and consequently incorporated into the KCC for paracetamol-related ALF. The variability of blood lactate level in response to aggressive circulatory, fluid, resuscitation extends the importance of this aspect of care in determining the predictive strength of this parameter [26]. The KCC have been developed for both paracetamol- and non-paracetamol-related ALF to assist decisions regarding referral to specialist centres that perform OLT and to decide whom to priority list for transplantation as outlined in Tables 2.2 and 2.3.",

In addition, severe lung injury with high PEEPs (10\u201315 cm of water) and fractional inspired oxygen >0.8 with oxygen saturations <92% represent an extreme in the setting of ALF. However toxic liver syndrome as a cause of lung injury, needs to be considered and there is possibly a benefit associated with transplantation in this setting.",

Additionally, particular attention to the optimization of the circulation with both appropriate early invasive monitoring directing aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support is the key. The early use of empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents along with strict infection control measures are necessary. Furthermore, due to the high frequency of sepsis in the absence of SIRS symptoms a low threshold for obtaining cultures and broadening antibiotic cover deteriorates is required when the clinical condition. A keen awareness of the potential for raised ICH, particularly in the young, necessitates appropriate monitoring and management, which will be discussed in detail in a separate chapter. Furthermore, in parallel with supportive measures an assessment of the clinical history and prognostic variables must be undertaken to determine, which patients fulfil national transplantation criteria. The decision to list a patient for super-urgent liver transplantation is often difficult and can be affected by age, co-morbidities, the dynamics of the clinical condition, and psychosocial factors. The clinical course for those that are not \u00adtransplanted is often precarious and associated with a high mortality. It is affected by the speed and degree of hepatic regeneration and the impact of the cumulative insults that include recurrent sepsis, persistent AKI requiring prolonged RRT, and critical illness neuropathy/myopathy resulting in extended periods of rehabilitation in those that survive. On the contrary, patients who proceed to transplantation and receive a good functioning graft often experience swift resolution of the circulatory and neurovascular disarray and have significantly improved outcomes albeit offset by the long-term impact of lifelong immunosuppression.",
