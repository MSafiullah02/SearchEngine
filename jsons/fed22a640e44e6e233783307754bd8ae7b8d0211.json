While the rate of HIV transmission is slowing, it is estimated that 2.6 million new infections occur yearly [ 1 ] . In the United States, there are approximately 1.2 million living with HIV/AIDS, with 50,000 new HIV infections and 17,000 deaths from the disease annually [ 2 ] . For those who can obtain effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV/AIDS has become a chronic disease with life expectancies over 30 years [ 3 ] . Research in the last 10 years has revealed the importance of alcohol in the HIV/ AIDS epidemic. Alcohol use, in moderate or hazardous amounts, has been associated with increased acquisition of HIV infection, progression of HIV infection, deleterious effects on HIV treatment, and acceleration in the comorbidities of HIV infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Yet alcohol remains the \"forgotten drug\" of the HIV/AIDS epidemic [ 10 ] .",

While there are few studies of adherence in developing countries, one study from India con fi rms the association of alcohol use and risk of nonadherence or discontinuation of ART medications [ 72 ] . Convincingly, there is a dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and adherence, with higher amounts of alcohol or more hazardous drinking being associated with poorer measures of adherence. Samet et al. found that the amount of alcohol consumption was the strongest predictor of adherence with highest levels of adherence being found in those abstinent from alcohol compared to moderate use or at-risk use [ 70 ] . Chander et al., studying nearly 2,000 HIVinfected persons receiving care at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, found that adherence was 22% lower in moderate alcohol users and 54% lower in hazardous alcohol users compared to no alcohol use. Adherence was further decreased by 68% with concurrent drug use [ 65 ] .",

            "text": "There may be several reasons for lower adherence in persons who use alcohol. Drinking pattern affects the likelihood of noncompliance. Braithwaite et al., studying 2,700 members of The Veterans Administration Aging Cohort Study (VACS), found that abstainers missed ART on 2% of days. Nonbinge drinkers missed medication on 4% of drinking days and post-drinking days but only on 2% of nondrinking days. Binge drinkers, in contrast, missed ART on 11% of drinking days, 5.5% of postdrinking days, and 4% on nondrinking days [ 6 ] . Therefore, while medication adherence was lower on drinking days for binge and non-binge drinkers, missing medications was increased twofold among binge drinkers on days they were either not drinking or post-drinking. This suggests that nonadherence was also due to factors not directly related to alcohol but related to characteristics common among binge drinkers [ 6 ] . Sankar et al. studied beliefs about alcohol and ART medication interactions in a group of African-American patients treated for HIV [ 71 ] . Over three quarters of those surveyed felt that \"alcohol and ART do not mix\"; one-third attributed this to alcohol making ART ineffective and another third felt that alcohol made ART more toxic. In this study, participants reported purposely skipping ART doses when they drank, with light drinkers skipping 64% of the times when they drank and moderate drinkers 55% of the times. However, heavy drinkers skipped ART only 29% of the time when they drank and reported that they felt no ill effects from drinking and taking ART [ 71 ] . Thus, medication adherence is determined by amount of alcohol intake, drinking pattern (binge or non-binge drinking), and beliefs about the safety of alcohol combined with ART. Issues of medication adherence and alcohol are further discussed in Chap. 18 and in a meta-analysis by Hendershot [ 17 ] .",

In rhesus macaques inoculated with SIV infection, SIV replication was 31-to 85-fold higher in monkeys with chronic alcohol ingestion compared to controls [ 21 ] . SIV replication persisted in the central nervous system of alcohol-fed monkeys but was undetectable in control monkeys. Poonia et al. proposed that the mechanism of alcohol's effect on SIV replication is through its effect on intestinal lymphocytes since the small intestine is one of the most lymphocyterich organs. Alcohol-fed monkeys had lower numbers of CD8 cells (before and after SIV infection) and higher numbers of CD4 cells in the small intestine after SIV infection. They suggested that the 1-2 log 10 increase in SIV replication in alcohol-fed monkeys occurs because of the increase in number of CD4 cells susceptible to SIV infection in the small intestine and reduction in CD8 cells which may control SIV replication [ 22 ] . Chronic alcohol ingestion also altered the course of HIV infection with alcohol-fed monkeys having lower CD4 cell counts, lower caloric intake, higher TNF-alpha expression, and a more rapid progression to end-stage SIV disease (mean 374 days compared to 900 days in controls) [ 23, 24 ] .",

However, two well-controlled, longitudinal studies since the introduction of combination ART have shown that alcohol is associated with HIV disease progression. Samet et al. studied alcohol use in 595 participants in the MACS cohort over 7 years [ 82 ] . Heavy alcohol use was associated with a lower mean CD4 cell count (by ~50 cells/mL) but not a decline in CD4 percentage or HIV viral load when adjusted for adherence. Baum et al. studied 231 HIV-positive persons followed for 2.5 years [ 5 ] . Frequent alcohol users of \u00b3 2 drinks/day were almost 3 times more likely to develop a CD4 count \u00a3 200 cells/mL, which is an AIDS-de fi ning event. This effect was particularly marked in alcohol users not on ART whose risk of developing a CD4 count \u00a3 200 cells/mL was nearly 8 times nondrinkers. In this study, alcohol use was associated with higher HIV viral load in those on ART but not in those without ART. These results suggest that the effect of alcohol on HIV viral load is mediated through adherence. However, the effect of alcohol in lowering absolute CD4 count rather than percentage could be in fl uenced by the splenomegaly and secondary lymphopenia seen with alcoholism and chronic viral hepatitis [ 83 ] . Moderate to heavy alcohol use has also been associated with increased HIV viral shedding in the female genital tract after controlling for plasma viral load [ 20 ] suggesting that alcohol may affect HIV transmission by physiological as well as behavioral risk factors.",

The model predicted decreased survival by >1 year in nonhazardous drinkers drinking at least once a week, 3.3 years in nonhazardous drinkers drinking daily, and up to 6.4 years in hazardous drinkers drinking daily. However, the VACS index, subsequently developed to predict decreases in life expectancy based on HIV and non-HIV characteristics, does not include a separate variable for alcohol or drug abuse beyond adjusting for severity of liver disease and coexisting HCV infection [ 85 ] .

These include brief interventions as well as more intensive behavioral, social network, and medication interventions. Brief interventions, also referred to as brief motivational interviews, are typically a single session discussing the patients' alcohol use. Studies employing this type of intervention often involve exploration of the pros and cons of a patient's alcohol use, self-assessment of the patient's alcohol consumption severity, and a more formal assessment of the patient's alcohol consumption as compared to the general population [ 150 ] . More extensive behavioral interventions have also been investigated, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivation enhancement, or 12-step programs. Each of these behavioral interventions is directly aimed at investigating personal motivation behind alcohol consumption and developing personal behavior modi fi cation strategies [ 151 ] . These interventions typically require multiple sessions. In addition to individualized plans and programs for those with increased alcohol consumption, social network and structural interventions which target larger populations and communities have also been evaluated. Social network interventions have most commonly focused on employing in fl uential community leaders to change speci fi c behaviors or promote health-conscious decisions. These studies, often referred to as Popular Opinion Leader (POL) or peer-based model interventions, may be particularly effective in communities that are dif fi cult for outside researchers to impact [ 152 ] . Alternatively, structural interventions, which may include political and legal action, may also be effective in altering individuals' behavior and environment. Lastly, medications, such as disul fi ram, naltrexone, and acamprosate, have been shown to decrease alcohol consumption via physiologic effects, including decreasing cravings or causing adverse reactions when alcohol is consumed [ 149 ] .",

A third factor to consider is the outcome that is being targeted. For example, previous trials have examined the effects of alcohol interventions on decreasing alcohol consumption, improving adherence to antiretroviral medication and/or reducing sexual risk behaviors. The combination of the type of intervention, the setting in which the intervention is implemented, the population that is being targeted, and the expected outcomes of the trial will all contribute to the success or failure of an intervention.",

For example, one study targeting MSM in the USA with alcohol use disorders combined two types of interventions (motivational interviewing and peer-group education/support strategies) and examined the effects on reducing at-risk drinking and sexual risk behaviors [ 157 ] . In this study, individuals receiving the combined intervention reported signi fi cantly lower number of days of drinking and number of heavy drinking days per 30-day period compared to control participants. Another study tested the effects of a brief theorybased behavioral HIV-alcohol risk-reduction intervention on sexual risk behaviors in men and women recruited from informal drinking establishments in a suburban township of Capetown, South Africa [ 50 ] . The authors reported signi fi cant reductions in unprotected intercourse, increased use of condoms, and less use of alcohol before sex in the intervention group compared to controls, with the largest impacts among lighter drinkers. These two studies illustrate the success of individual counseling interventions for reducing risk behaviors around alcohol consumption among persons at risk for or living with HIV.",

A study in the VA population showed that the sensitivity for health-care providers' ability to diagnose hazardous drinking was only 22% [ 163 ] . Thus far, trials of interventions to reduce hazardous drinking in populations affected by HIV have shown mixed results. The underdiagnosis of hazardous alcohol use and lack of proven, effective treatment strategies raise the question of whether there is any \"safe\" level of alcohol intake in HIV. Justice et al. examined the relationship of medical illness related to alcohol use in veterans with HIV infection [ 164 ] . For diseases associated with alcohol use (HCV infection, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, and certain infections), there was a linear relationship between alcohol intake category (none, moderate, hazardous) and the disease. This suggests that there may be no \"safe\" level of alcohol intake for HIV-infected persons [ 165 ] . More aggressive screening and treatment of alcohol-related disorders is clearly warranted to prevent HIV transmission and to improve treatment and outcomes of persons with HIV infection [ 84 ] .",
