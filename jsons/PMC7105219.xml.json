Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important pathogens. Chronic colonization of the airways with P. aeruginosa is associated with progressive and irreversible lung disease. Besides a constitutive inflammatory state, CF typically has a course of exacerbations and remissions of pulmonary complaints, suggesting that external factors influence this course. Respiratory viruses are known to cause significant morbidity in infants, elderly and the immunocompromised. In asthma up to 80% of exacerbations in children are associated with viral infections [1].",

Influenza A and B take 12\u201327%, or even up to 77% in one small study [5]. Parainfluenzavirus is found in lower frequencies, only one study showing a contribution of 43% [7]. Adenovirus is reported in 8\u201315% of all viruses. Most studies failed to detect rhinovirus, probably because the use of serology or culture. Serology is difficult due to the large number of rhinovirus subtypes and culture is relatively insensitive. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is up to eleven times more sensitive to detect rhinoviruses in children [11]. The only study using PCR demonstrated rhinoviruses in 58% of cases with respiratory complaints [10]. Other viral agents like enteroviruses, Epstein Barr virus and cytomegalovirus have been shown to play a role in CF respiratory symptoms in low frequencies. Coronavirus was reported only once with a frequency of 28% [8].",

Several studies demonstrated a deterioration of Shwachman scores [10], [12], [13], [14] or radiological scores [2], [13], [14] at long-term follow up after viral respiratory infections. The severity of deterioration was related to the frequency of viral respiratory infections [12], [13] or hospitalizations [2]. Patients with virus associated lower respiratory tract infections had more frequently pulmonary exacerbations or hospitalizations [6], [12], [14] and a higher use of antibiotics [9], [10], [13] at long-term follow-up, compared to CF patients without virus associated lower respiratory tract infections.",
