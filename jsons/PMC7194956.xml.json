As defined in the \"influenza pandemic\" plan by the ECDC, this rationalization of mask distribution and use requires:-Definition of a strategy for the development and acquisition of health products and medical devices (definition of the doctrine of use);-Verification of availability;-Preparation of the \"logistic scheme for the distribution of health products and equipment\";-Preparation of mask stocks;-Updating of protection and security plans for production and storage facilities for protective equipment and healthcare products.\n",

It is indicated for the protection of the wearer's environment, as it is intended to avoid, when the wearer exhales, the projection of secretions from the upper airways or saliva that may contain infectious agents transmissible by \"droplet\" or \"air\" routes. A surgical mask is designed for a single use only. It should be changed as soon as it becomes wet and at least every 4 hours at the most, taking into account the conditions of use and integrity. Surgical masks must bear on their packaging: the CE marking, the dated reference of standard EN 14683, and the type of mask (type I, II, IIR). This last information characterizes the performances of bacterial filtration, differential pressure and resistance pressure to splash, according to EN14683, the last being required only for IIR masks. A medical face mask with an appropriate microbial barrier can also be effective in reducing the emission of infective agents from the nose and mouth of an asymptomatic carrier or a patient with clinical symptoms.",
