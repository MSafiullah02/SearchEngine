We also included sera from MERS-CoV infected camels (2) as well as sera from MERS-CoV vaccinated camels (3) to validate the use of the assays for camel MERS-CoV diagnostics and evaluation of immune responses following vaccination (Appendix Table 1 , sample sets D1-D3). The use of human sera from the Netherlands was approved by the local medical ethical committee (MEC approval no. 2014-414) and from South Korea by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (approval no. 1506-093-681). The use of camel sera was approved as previously described (2,3)",

ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 2 ug/ml recombinant DPP4 in PBS. The plates were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS-0.5% tween-20 for 1 hr at room temp. In the meantime, 1/20 diluted sera (or further 2fold serially diluted for titer determination) were mixed with 5 ng of S1-mFc in a total volume of 100 ul blocking buffer per well and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Wells with no serum (only S1-mFc) were included in each run to calculate to maximum binding. Following 1 hr of incubation the mix was transferred to blocked plates and allowed to incubate for 1 hr further. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS/0.05% tween-20, and the amount of S1-mFc bound to the plate was determined by adding HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Dako) and incubating for 1 hr. Following washing, the signal was revealed by adding 100 ul of TMB and the reaction was stopped using sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured using Tecan. Blocking was determined as percentage reduction of the sample signal from the blank signal (no serum). A 50% reduction in signal (RBI50) in a \u22651/20 diluted sample was considered positive. Serum antibody titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in a \u226550% signal reduction.",
