            "text": "Felis margarita Loche, 1858 is a felid commonly called the sand cat. It is 1 of 6 species in the genus Felis. One of the smallest of the wild cats, Felis margarita, is adapted behaviorally and morphologically to live in desert environments. Prey includes rodents, birds, reptiles, and arthropods. This species has a wide, but disjunct distribution through northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and southwest and central Asia. F. margarita occurs at low densities throughout its range and is listed as \"Near Threatened\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources due to habitat degradation and its low and potentially declining population. F. margarita is bred in zoos in North America and Europe.",

            "text": "noMenClatural noteS. Captain Victor Loche, a naturalist, described Felis margarita from a specimen collected in the northern Sahara (Loche 1858) . This species was named in honor of General Jean Auguste Margueritte who was commandant of the French army unit stationed in Algeria in the 1850s (Loche 1858; Qumsiyeh 1996) . The holotype of F. margarita was originally in Loche's personal collection but has disappeared and is likely lost (Haltenorth 1953; Schauenberg 1974; Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska 1991) . Other names for the sand cat include sand dune cat, General Margueritte's cat (English), chat des sables (French), sandkatze (German), gato de las arenas, gato del Sahara (Spanish), qit el ramel, qit ramli, biss ramli (Arabic), gorbeh sheni (Farsi, Iran), hattul holot (Israel), sevin (Kazakh), peshaya koshka, barchannaya koshka (Russian), qareschtar, aghsheter (Tamahaq, central Sahara), and mushuk (Uzbek-Nowell and Jackson 1996) . Rosevear (1974) speculated that Loche in naming F. margarita had intended to use the correct spelling of General Margueritte's name, but a printing error occurred, causing the second \"t\" from Margueritte's name to be dropped. Rosevear (1974) believes that it is unthinkable that Loche would have insulted a high-ranking officer and friend by deliberately attaching a femine forename to an animal, which he hoped would commemorate this officer's support. Trouessart (1897 Trouessart ( , 1904 eventually recorded what he thought was Loche's original intention. However, the original spelling of the specific name margarita has been retained to avoid confusion because of its long and wide usage. Ognev (1927) described a desert cat 1st collected in the Karakum Desert of Turkmenistan, 4,800 km away from Loche's discovery, as Eremaelurus thinobius. The Transcaspian sand cat was named Felis thinobius by Pocock (1938a) and recognized as a separate species by Haltenorth (1953) and Weigel (1961) . Heptner and Dementiev (1937) argued that these sand cats belonged to F. margarita. No other evidence of the extent of the F. margarita distribution existed beyond these 2 widely separated areas until a specimen was collected in Arabia in the 1950s (Harrison 1968 ). The discovery of the sand cat in southwestern Balochistan, Pakistan, filled an important gap in the known distribution of this species (Lay et al. 1970 ). Loche's margarita and Ognev's thinobius were restudied and reclassified as subspecies of F. margarita (Heptner 1970; Hemmer 1974b; Schauenberg 1974; Wozencraft 2005; Wilson and Mittermeier 2009) . Heptner and Sludskii (1992) proposed that the forms Felis airensis and F. meinertzhageni from North Africa represented by only 1 specimen each were no more than individual variations of the nominate form, F. margarita. and Wilson and Mittermeier (2009) ",

The mean age of 1st reproduction for males was 3 years and 59 days, although 50% of the males sired their 1st litter before 2 years and 9 months. The oldest female to give birth was 13 years and 11 months and the oldest male to sire a litter was 11 years and 11 months (Breton 2013) . The shortest interval between births was 71 days, suggesting that females may come into heat 4-8 days after birth of a litter. The age-specific fecundity rate for both sexes reaches a maximum at 2-3 years of age and then begins to decline; the female fecundity rate declines more rapidly than that of the males (Breton 2013) . Herrick et al. (2005) studied aspects of the reproductive biology of F. margarita in captive cats. Ejaculates contained (mean \u00b1 SE; n = 10) 43.5 \u00b1 11.0 \u00d7 10 6 total spermatozoa, with 77.0 \u00b1 2.3% motility, 43.8 \u00b1 3.9% normal morphology, and 93.1 \u00b1 1.3% intact acrosomes.

An 8-year study in this area yielded 3 years with a higher density (2-3 cats per 100 km of survey route) and 5 years with lower density (1 per 100 km of survey route- Belousova 1993) . The distribution of F. margarita appears to be declining in areas where human activity has negatively impacted its habitat and prey base (Heptner and Sludskii 1992; Wilson and Mittermeier 2009) . The introduction of feral and domestic dogs and cats is another serious problem because of increasing competition, predation, and the potential for disease transmission. Snow cover in central Asia hampers hunting by F. margarita. For example, the severe winter conditions of 1953-1954 in the southern one-half of the Kyzylkum Desert with snow cover lasting for 3 months led to high F. margarita mortality. Following that winter, the number of F. margarita caught by fur traders declined 2-10 times. The population of F. margarita in the Chagai Desert of Baluchistan, Pakistan, was devastated by commercial collectors within a decade after their presence was discovered in the mid-1960s (Hemmer 1977; Roberts 1997) . Although Nowell and Jackson (1996) indicated F. margarita still occurred widely in this area, this species is now considered endangered in Pakistan (Mallon et al. 2011) . Heptner and Sludskii (1992) speculated that in the mid-1900s, F. margarita populations in central Asia were stable despite harvests of 100-200 pelts per year. F. margarita was thought to be common in the Karakum Desert in the mid-1960s (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . Belousova (1993) reported F. margarita being commonly sighted in the Ustyurt and Mangyshlak desert regions in western Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and frequently found in the northern Kyzylkum Desert; however, some populations were declining because of development impacts.",

These cats are capable of rapid digging to capture burrow-dwelling rodents (Schauenberg 1974) . F. margarita has also been observed leaving its den to feed on swarming locusts (Khan 1998) . F. margarita is not known to scavenge but will cover large kills with sand and return later to feed (Dragesco-Joff\u00e9 1993) . Most of the water in its diet is derived from its food. However, F. margarita will drink, if water is readily available. Unfortunately, the food habits of F. margarita are difficult to study because it covers its scats with sand obscuring the location (Hemmer 1977; Abbadi 1993) . Like other felids, F. margarita is capable of eating large amounts of food when the food is available, but under normal circumstances probably consumes about 10% of its own body weight per day (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) .",

These reptile species are diurnal foragers and likely taken by F. margarita during the day. Remains of spiny-tailed lizards (Uromastyx aegyptius) found near F. margarita burrows in the United Arab Emirates also suggest that this cat may forage diurnally more than previously thought (Cunningham 2002) . Abbadi (1991) observed F. margarita catch and eat a lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus) and a gecko (Stenodactylus) at dawn. Roberts (1997) suggests that F. margarita in the Nushki Desert, Pakistan, adapts its hunting to times when its prey are active.

Because of the prominence of Gerbillus in the Felis margarita diet, these ectoparasite species likely infest F. margarita as well. Sapozhenkov (1961) reported fleas infesting Gerbillus co-occurring on F. margarita in Turkmenistan. Five F. margarita collected near Repetek, Turkmenistan, were infested with fleas (Synosternus pallidus, Xenopsylla hirtipes, and X. gerbillii). A tick (Hyalomma asiaticum) was also found on 1 F. margarita from this area. F. margarita from the northern Kyzylkum Desert is parasitized by fleas (S. longispinus and S. pallidus), which are typically found in association with the long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus), another prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1992) .",

Captive F. margarita may give birth throughout the year, but limited records from the wild suggest that births are seasonal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . Mellen (1993) reported selected reproductive data for captive F. margarita: the duration of mounts with intromission 8.83 \u00b1 2.13 min (n = 13), length of estrus 5.25 \u00b1 0.75 days (n = 2), gestation length 66.5 \u00b1 0.5 days (n = 2), litter size 2.92 \u00b1 0.21, and male age at maturity (birth to 1st litter sired) 67.7 weeks. The typical copulatory sequence begins with the male approaching the female (Mellen 1993) . The male grasps the female by the nape and mounts using the forelegs followed by hind legs. The female responds to the nape biting by adopting a lordosis posture and moving her tail to one side. The male follows with intromission and pelvic thrusting. Mounts resulting in intromission are followed by a copulatory cry (barely audible growl) by the female. The female then throws the male off and begins rolling on her back (typically lasting 5-30 s). Mellen (1993) found that a change in relative rates of some behaviors was the most reliable indicator of estrus and reproductive activity.",

            "text": "Communication.-Felis margarita vocalizations are similar to those of F. catus. Like F. catus, F. margarita may mew, growl, spit, hiss, scream, and purr, but some of their other vocalizations are quite different (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . Their vocal repertoire includes the gurgle, a friendly, close contact call (Peters 1984) . Both sexes use intense mew calls for multiple purposes including long-distance communication, attracting mating partners, predator avoidance, and calling young (Huang et al. 2002; Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . The intense mew calls of F. margarita are short (< 0.5 s), sharp calls, and typically several are uttered in rapid succession at medium-high pitch (Peters et al. 2009 ), reminding some workers of a small dog barking (Hemmer 1974b (Hemmer , 1977 Schauenberg 1974) . Peters et al. (2009) studied acoustic parameters of 119 intense mew calls by 2 F. margarita males including duration (mean, range; 275 ms, 160-490 ms), fundamental frequency (0.36 kHz, 0.15-0.53 kHz), and dominant frequency (0.63 kHz, 0.41-0.78 kHz). The frequency spectrum for F. margarita intense mew calls is mainly restricted to below 2 kHz, the range to which their ear is adapted (Huang et al. 2002) . Peters et al. (2009) speculate that the spectral characteristics of F. margarita intense mew calls evolved to reduce call attenuation when propagating through desert habitats where vegetation is scarce or absent. Chan (2005) reported that F. margarita has lower mean acoustic thresholds (by 6-9 dB) between 0.25 and 5 kHz than other felid species that have been studied, supporting the hypothesis that F. margarita hearing is unusually sensitive.",

Social behaviors recorded for F. margarita include spitting, hissing, growl, strike, strike using paw, anogenital sniff, social sniff, follow, displace, approach, and face off for both sexes (Mellen 1993) . Males also exhibited mounting and nape biting. Females also exhibited lordosis and chase. Wemmer and Scow (1977) studied contact patterns in F. margarita. Four patterns were common: rubbing, sniffing, biting, and patting with the forepaw. Body rubbing between siblings and between siblings and adults was infrequent. Sniffing was rare but was concentrated on the head-neck area when it occurred. Biting was concentrated on the head and neck, although other parts of the body were also bitten. Patting with the forepaw was directed primarily to the head and neck (ear, cheek, neck), less frequently to the tail, and infrequently to the hind legs and anogenital region (Wemmer and Scow 1977) . Bennett and Mellen (1983) observed a pair of F. margarita in captivity. These cats devoted the greatest amount of their time to pacing and resting. Social interactions occurred infrequently. The male marked and urinated/defecated more than the female. Only one of these cats was active at a time. The female paced and moved more during estrous periods.",

Dens are shared by different individuals, but not at the same time (Abbadi 1989 (Abbadi , 1991 (Abbadi , 1993 . However, F. margarita pairs may share the same burrows during the breeding season (Schauenberg 1974) . Once a burrow is selected, F. margarita typically does not change burrows during the day. F. margarita utilizes burrows that it digs itself, burrows abandoned by other animals (e.g., red fox, Corsac fox, R\u00fcppell's fox, or porcupine-Erethizon dorsatum), or it may enlarge a gerbil or ground squirrel burrow (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . F. margarita usually burrows into the compact soil at the base of a small mound, beneath a shrub, or away from vegetation on a flat sand surface (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) . F. margarita may prefer to burrow in areas with rodent burrows, but tracks indicate that it regularly hunts over shifting sand dunes (Roberts 1997). One den in the northern Kyzylkum Desert was constructed by enlarging a gerbil burrow and was home to a female F. margarita, her 3 young, and 5 great gerbils (Heptner and Sludskii 1992) . F. m. thinobia lives in shallow burrows in sand constructed among the roots of saltbushes or Calligonum plants.

In the undisturbed areas of the Sahara Desert and in Arabia, F. margarita may also hunt prey during the daylight hours (Dragesco-Joff\u00e9 1993) .

F. catus is beginning to encroach into habitat occupied by F. margarita (Ostrowski et al. 2003) and represents a potential epidemiologic risk to F. margarita in these areas. Additionally, in central Saudi Arabia, individual F. margarita has died because it was caught in diamond mesh fences (Sher Shah and Cunningham 2008) . Conservation scientists speculate that the possible effective population size of F. margarita might be below 10,000 breeding individuals with no subpopulation having an effective size greater than 1,000 (Mallon et al. 2011) . A declining trend is hypothesized due to habitat degradation and an eroding prey base. If these perceived trends persist, or if better documentation of species status and range becomes available, F. margarita may qualify as \"Vulnerable.\" Understanding the natural history of F. margarita and documenting its distribution should be priorities (Nowell and Jackson 1996) . F. margarita is one of the most widespread cats, but one of the rarest and least well known.",
