The clinical profiles and backgrounds of all subjects were extracted from medical records. Of the 352 case patients, 52 (patient group 1 [P1]) had comorbid conditions (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart diseases, tuberculosis, asthma, and malignancy), which have been shown to be risk factors for the development of SARS [7, 8]. Of the 300 case patients without comorbid conditions, 20 were patients with severe SARS (patient group 2 [P2]), who were identified by their admissions to intensive care units or deaths, and the remaining 280 were patients with mildly symptomatic SARS (patient group 3 [P3]). By checking the medical records or by interviewing the case patients or their guardians, we determined that all case patients were genetically unrelated adults born in northern China. For the 352 patients, the male/female ratio was 1.2, and the mean age was 34.9 years (range, 15\u201377 years). A total of 392 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched healthy genetically unrelated adults born in northern China were recruited as control subjects; the male/female ratio was 1.5, and the mean age was 32.7 years (range, 17\u201368 years). Written, informed consent was obtained from all the participants or their guardians, and the study was performed with the approval of the Ethical Committee of the Chinese Human Genome Center. Genomic DNA was extracted from 5-mL peripheral blood samples using standard phenol-chloroform protocols. DNA samples were diluted to a concentration of 10 ng/\u03bcL and were distributed in 96-well plates",

AF080508.1), were designed on the basis of size and overlap of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons. The screening panel included DNA from 174 individuals randomly selected, without regard to disease status, from the total study population of 744 individuals. The primers for the target regions were designed using the Web-based software Primer3 (available at: http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/). DNA samples from the 174 individuals were amplified and purified. Then the PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit with Amplitaq DNA polymerase (ABI) and loaded onto an ABI 3730 sequencer. Polymorphism candidates were identified by the PolyPhred program (available at: http://droog.mbt.washington.edu/PolyPhred.html) and were inspected by 2 observers. Polymorphism positions and individual genotypes were confirmed by reamplifying and resequencing the polymorphism sites from the opposite strand. The primers are available on request",

The primers for PCR and sequencing and the reaction parameters were identical with those used for the polymorphism validation procedure mentioned above. Genotyping of all 744 samples was performed in a blinded manner so that the case or control status was unknown.

Formation of a triple helix in the collagenous tail is impaired by the variant B allele, and this impaired helix formation disrupts polymerization and leads to enzymatic degradation and functional deficiency of MBL [24]. The nt \u2212221 promoter variant X allele has a smaller but detectable effect on serum concentrations of functional MBL, and its interplay with structural mutations results in a more substantial decrease in the expression of MBL [25]. The individuals bearing medium- or low-expression haplotype pairs had an increased risk of developing SARS (table 2), which suggests that MBL deficiency possibly plays a role in susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection",

Various studies have shown that MBL binds to clinically relevant pathogens, including HIV-1 and influenza virus [16, 17]. Recently, it has been reported that, in chickens, MBL can take part in the neutralization of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the CoV family, before the humoral antibody response takes over [34]. The S protein of SARS-CoV, which plays an important role in infection, is also glycosylated with high mannose or hybrid oligosaccharides [35\u201337]. Thus, it is very likely that MBL can bind to the S protein of SARS-CoV and exert its role as an antivirus, although additional studies are needed to clarify this possibility",

This results in a type II error (a false-negative error). Because the unexposed individuals in the general population remain at risk for the development of SARS, the inclusion of such a control group limits the ability to obtain positive results when comparing contributions of polymorphisms in control subjects with those in case patients. Thus, from this point of view, it seems unlikely that the association between having the codon 54 variant and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection is a false-positive error (i.e., it is unlikely that there was a type I error)",

Although the highly significant association between MBL deficiency and increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection derives from a biologically based a priori hypothesis, our initial finding should be independently verified in other subpopulations of ethnic Chinese origin (e.g., Guangdong, Taiwanese, or Hong Kong Chinese) or in those of different ancestry, such as whites",

First, individuals who harbor the susceptibility genotype in the MBL gene are at high risk for developing SARS. The usefulness of general screenings to detect MBL mutations and MBL deficiency in a defense against future SARS outbreaks should be determined. Second, vaccines against SARS are expected to exert a greater influence in the future control of SARS. Our results may help in the selection of candidates for vaccination and in the confirmation of effective vaccines for high-risk groups. Third, replacement MBL therapy has been used in patients with repeated infections, and a possible beneficial effect was seen [38]. The usefulness of this intervention in SARS might merit assessment. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this study helps to explain why, in most settings, the attack rate for SARS is much lower than that for most respiratory viruses. In fact, in the present study, the frequencies of the genotype and haplotype pairs conferring protection from SARS-CoV infection were very high. For example, the frequencies of the codon 54 A/A genotype and high\u2013MBL expression haplotype pairs reached 76.8% and 74.5%, respectively (table 2)",

The AF calculated by the RR (OR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.25\u20132.39]) (table 2) combined with the frequency of the A/B and B/B genotypes (34.4%) (table 2) indicates that 20.1% (95% CI, 7.9%\u201332.3%) of the increase in the risk of developing SARS can be attributed to the variant B allele. If this association is real, then the variant B allele is associated with a relatively low fraction of SARS-CoV infection in the Chinese individuals studied here, thereby suggesting that other genes are likely to modify the susceptibility to such an infection. When many susceptibility genes are identified and gene-gene interactions among polymorphisms in these genes are taken into account, the prediction of the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection may become more accurate",
