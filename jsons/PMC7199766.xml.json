The first case was identified on December 8, 2019, and this disease was initially reported by China to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019.1,2 On March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic because of the rapidly increasing numbers of infected cases throughout countries in Europe and America, and the confirmed case numbers reached more than 125 000 cases.3",

That may partly explain why the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in teenagers is much higher than that in small children, according to data from the TCDC. In infanthood and toddlerhood, the major contacts of small children are further narrowed to their family and caregivers, and thus their COVID-19 incidence seems to be the lowest.

Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has yet to be proven, but case reports of sick neonates exist. Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling disease spread.
