Probabilistic and max-plus automata are part of the general family of weighted automata, whose semantics are maps from words to real values. Given two weighted automata, the equivalence problem asks whether their semantics are the same, and the containment problem whether one is point-wise smaller than the other one. These problems have been studied intensively and this paper will review some techniques used to show (un)decidability and state a list of open questions that still remain.",

Since probabilistic and max-plus automata compute functions from words to real values, another natural problem is to wonder whether the function computed by a given probabilistic (resp. max-plus) automaton is point-wise smaller than the function computed by another probabilistic (resp. max-plus) automaton. This is called the containment problem. These problems are highly dependant on the semiring under consideration and have originally been tackled using very different techniques for probabilistic and max-plus automata. We will however present one technique that can be used in both cases to show the undecidability of the containment problem for both max-plus and probabilistic automata which are linearly ambiguous.",

They can also be seen as weighted automata in any semiring as follows: for a given Boolean automaton B, and a semiring S, construct the weighted automaton A by giving weight 1 to transitions in B (and 0 to non-existing transitions). It is easy to see that for every word w, w is accepted by B if and only if [[plus automata are weighted automata over this semiring. Given a maxplus automaton A, it is easy to construct a min-plus automaton B by changing all the weights to their opposite to obtain [[A]] = \u2212[[B]]. Most of the results later on given for max-plus automata can thus be easily translated for minplus automata. However, when restricting the domain of the semiring to N, the translation does not work anymore and for the results which are only valid in N, one has to be more careful when translating from max-plus to min-plus and vice-versa.",
