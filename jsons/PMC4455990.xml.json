            "text": "Internet connectivity has opened the door to new techniques for disease detection worldwide1. These ideas have been applied to influenza, given its annual occurrence and the potential for pandemics and emerging infections2. Accurate and rapid surveillance of influenza and other acute respiratory infections could: reduce the costs associated with unnecessary investigations, facilitate more timely (and hence more effective) use of antiviral drugs for influenza, help prevent the secondary spread of infection, reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics and shorten hospital stays3. Over the last decade, Internet-based influenza surveillance systems have been developed and deployed nationally in Australia, the United States and Canada and 10 countries in Europe4\n,\n5\n,\n6. These systems have pioneered the ability to involve individual volunteers in public health through a participatory process; influenza and acute respiratory illness-related symptoms are collected from community members who voluntarily report their health status on a weekly basis via web and mobile apps. Data from these systems have demonstrated the potential to better understand acute respiratory illness in the population by detecting trends early and at the point of contact, piecing together real-time patterns of disease spread, identifying important subpopulations, monitoring the course of an epidemic or pandemic, and helping to target prevention and control efforts. However, none of these Internet-based systems employ molecular diagnostics to rapidly confirm the viral cause of illness, which is important because the clinical presentation of influenza is similar to illness caused by other respiratory pathogens7.",

In all of these technologies, there are common threads needing investigation, with respect to the types of specimens, both in regards to feasibility of viral detection as well as the willingness and capability of individuals to generate the sample on their own. Specimens for molecular detection of acute respiratory infections generally consist of nasopharyngeal wash and aspirate as the gold standard, however there are safety concerns for lay volunteers to collect this type of specimen at home10. Nasal swabs have been successfully used by volunteers to collect viable samples for influenza culture at home, at first for individuals whom were classified by nurses to have 'colds and flu' 11\n,\n27. Further, nasal self sampling has been used as part of population-based surveillance of respiratory virus infections and compared to contemporaneous clinical surveillance specimens and general practitioner sampling in some European cohorts 26\n,\n28. To date, none of these systems have considered other specimen types, or reported how individuals' symptoms were linked to detected infection.",

Oral specimens have been widely used to obtain genetic material for direct-to-consumer medical tests14. As well, although the literature is sparse, oral specimens have been shown to be reliable in the detection of certain respiratory pathogens. Saliva were found to be accurate and reliable in the detection of H1N1 and comparable to the nasopharyngeal swab18. Oral specimens have also been found to be effective in the detection of SARS, measles and beta-hemolytic streptococcus in pediatric patients12\n,\n13\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17. Others have found oral specimens to be inferior to nasal swabs in the detection of respiratory viruses, but still suitable in settings where obtaining a nasal swab would be impractical21. Beyond specimen type, community participation in analysis and specimen collection for flu surveillance is also unexplored. Academic and commercial entities have demonstrated19\n,\n20\n,\n21 that home sample collection is feasible from the community and at scale for genomic, microbiome and STD testing23\n,\n24, however the utility and format of what information should be communicated back to individuals, in order to be useful to impact public health behaviors is a related and open question.",

To address these needs, we developed the GoViral platform. This platform is designed to acquire community generated diagnostic samples and couple them with other contemporaneous information such as participatory syndromic reports. Thus, GoViral enables us to test: 1) the types of samples that individuals are able to and willing to generate in their own homes in a timely fashion when they have an acute respiratory infection along with and appropriate processing methods, 2) how user-generated diagnostic information corresponds to self-reported symptoms and 3) reception and use of the information by the public.

We used a convenience sample in order to rapidly recruit participants and evaluate the platform during this first season (thus anticipating participants to be skewed towards those who have access to Internet), permitting investigation via a more representative sampling during subsequent years. Enrollment was driven largely by announcements on local radio stations and word of mouth. Paid online advertisements and social media were also used as means of recruiting volunteers to the study. The study size was limited by our ability to recruit and engage participants. In order to register, volunteers signed an electronic consent form and reported their email address, name and mailing address, gender and age. Volunteers were immediately sent a kit (see section below) to keep at home. Users were instructed that if they became sick with symptoms of a cold or flu, they should perform the specimen collection and rapid test within 48 hours of experiencing symptoms. Participants who returned a kit were sent a replacement, allowing them to report a second illness (second illness was included if the specimen was provided at least 2 weeks after the initial specimen). GoViral participants were also registered for Flu Near You and reported symptoms through weekly surveys, as has been previously described6. If a participant reported any symptoms on their weekly survey, they immediately were sent an email reminder to follow the instructions in the kit and submit specimens. Instructions for submission of the kit were made available on a report page. On the report page, an individual confirms the symptoms that they have, can view video instructions (Supplementary Information) for each of the sample types and rapid test, and they record the date illness began, the numbering on their sample tubes, and test results from the rapid test. All participants who signed up with a Massachusetts mailing address were sent a kit and their symptom reports were included in the study.",

The CerTest rapid test tested for Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV, and adenovirus. For the nasal specimen, we selected a nasal swab rather than a nasopharyngeal swab because it is easier to collect for the individual, and a previous study has demonstrated that they are comparable in sensitivity when using molecular diagnostic tests13. Self-collected flocked swabs have also been found to be equivalent in cell yield compared to staff collected flocked swabs22 and respiratory cell yields were higher when using flocked nasal swabs compared to rayon swabs14. For the saliva sample, we used the Oragene Saliva collection tube which has been designed for the collection and stabilization of microbial DNA and RNA from saliva. Samples are reported to remain stable at room temperature for up to 3 weeks in the stability solution included in the tube23. The kits, along with prepaid postage were mailed to participants at the beginning of the influenza season with pre-paid return overnight postage.

Multiple initial findings are offered: diagnostic samples can be generated by the public demonstrated by the high user participation rate (half of the people who reported any symptoms at all completed the kit and sent in specimens), and initial validation of oral specimens as compared with nasal specimens can be used for the identification of upper respiratory pathogens, along with reports of greater comfort and preference for oral specimens. While we anticipate the participation rate is biased upwards based on the types of people who may have agreed to participate in the study, it indicates that while sick at home, people are willing and able to complete the specimen collection. Influenza A, RSV, Coronavirus (3 subtypes), hMPV and HRV were detected from saliva and nasal samples, with high concordance between the nasal and saliva samples measured on two different detection methods. Pairing symptom profiles with the detected viruses showed that most people who self-report the common ILI profile did not have influenza. Through our survey, we found that most individuals who became ill and returned a sample did not seek healthcare, such as going to a clinic or the hospital. Overall, saliva collection was reported to be easier than the nasal swab specimen collection. Rapid immunoassays did not show value for community use, compared to the PCR detection of community-acquired specimens. Beyond the expected lower sensitivity and specificity of the rapid tests, the specifications for these tests have been determined using nasopharyngeal swabs on children, thus the performance on specimens from adults and using nasal swabs can be attributed to this difference. The different assays, GenMark and BioFire FilmArray, demonstrated similar performance with some false negatives on both saliva and nasal specimens from each system as compared to the other. We also found that individuals would find it useful to know what pathogens were detected in other people in the community. Regarding finding out their own diagnosis, most common reasons cited for desiring this information included concern for exposure to others, especially by those who also mentioned they work in healthcare. The results presented here suggest methods for achieving these preferences, and with further studies involving more and diverse groups the power of these conclusions will increase.",

Geographically, recruitment was purposefully limited but will be expanded in the future to target under-represented groups. Although the number of samples received was consistent with the expected number of individuals who would be sick with some type of respiratory infection, this indicates that in order to increase the number of samples, a greater number of participants are required. Finally, while rapid tests were included in the kits and obtaining rapid results is an incentive for individuals to participate, the performance was not specific nor sensitive enough to warrant further use. Different rapid diagnostic tests may be experimented with in forthcoming kits, as while the majority of individuals report they would like to receive the results of their own tests within two days, which is feasible with this model, a more real-time test is optimal for decision making.",

However, linkage to symptoms has been limited in self-sampling studies, and although other studies have demonstrated that individuals can obtain a nasal swab specimen from themselves, we report here that individuals prefer saliva and initial results indicate that it can potentially provide a feasible medium for acute upper respiratory infection detection.
