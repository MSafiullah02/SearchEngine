            "text": "Participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) has declined over the last few years, with the biggest decline occurring in the paid student category while participation in the free category increased.2, 3, 4 In part, the shift in participation away from the paid toward the free category reflects the greater number of students qualifying for free and reduced-price meals during the 2007-2009 recession and slow economic recovery, as well as through the use and expansion of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). Launched after the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act,2 this provision allows a school to offer free meals to all students without collection of the meal applications normally required for free and reduced-priced meals. Under CEP, schools are reimbursed using a formula based on the percentage of students categorically eligible for free meals given their participation in other specific means-tested programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.5 Some Academy members reported in an informal information-gathering survey that CEP reduces administrative burden associated with free and reduced-price meal application management and allows for more focused time on healthy menu planning, nutrition education, and customer service.",

A recent US Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study reported a 10-cent increase in the price of a paid lunch was associated with a decline of 0.7% in the rate of paid meal NSLP participation.6 Local discretion is used to establish the paid prices and to decide whether to extend a child in the paid category a credit or meal substitution if they do not have money to pay for their meal. The estimated average cost of a paid school lunch meal in the United States is between $2.48 and $2.74 depending on grade level.7 Meal debt can add up quickly over a week, month, or school year for families with multiple school-aged children living just above the reduced-priced category income cutoff who are unable to pay the balance.8\n",

The USDA included questions about charge and alternate meal policies in a multiyear, nationally representative study12 and also issued a request for information that generated more than 460 comments.13 In their report to Congress, the USDA shared that 58% of local educational authorities incurred unpaid meal costs during school year 2010-2011 and more than 93% served a reimbursable school meal on credit or an alternate meal to children who were not certified for free or reduced-price meals and were unable to pay for a meal. The study also found nearly all local educational authorities incurred unpaid meal debt and tried to recover the costs, usually by billing the student\u2019s parents or providers. Ultimately, the USDA required school districts to establish a policy for unpaid school meal fees but did not establish any national standards for what states or districts must include in these policies.14\n",

The Academy appreciates innovation in this area but also encourages states to continue to monitor and, if needed, respond to certain instances of unintended consequences of increasing meal debt. If a school district avoids lunch shaming and provides a student an unpaid meal charge, it ultimately must manage increased unpaid meal charges. Locally, many school districts have been developing innovative strategies and partnerships to mitigate unpaid meal debt and lunch shaming, such as encouraging families to complete their school meal applications and raising funds to pay off debt. The Academy is concerned that many local solutions are temporary and thus not sustainable and not always an option for communities with limited resources.",
