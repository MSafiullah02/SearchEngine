Strategies for electrochemical detection of DNA with solid electrodes have recently been reviewed (de-los-Santos-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2004) as well as electrochemical nucleic acid biosensors (Wang, 2002, Lucarelli et al., 2004). Sensitive methods are always required for DNA quantitation, specially when PCR preamplification is avoided (Patolsky et al., 2001). Moreover, selectivity is an important requirement for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in genes, the target of tailor-made medications (McCarthy and Hilfiker, 2000) and the key for obtaining medical information about important diseases (Brookes, 1999).",

            "text": "Basically, there are three different strategies for the electrochemical detection of DNA point mutations. Apart from indicator free approaches, charge transport through double-stranded DNA can be monitored. Single-base mismatches appear to induce significant perturbations in the electronic structure of the base-pair stack. Therefore, differences in the behaviour of redox-active intercalators (Yamashita et al., 2002, Wong and Gooding, 2003, Wakai et al., 2004) can be observed. Differences in hybridization of mismatched and complementary DNA strands with immobilized probes have been shown by surface plasmon resonance (Peterson et al., 2002) and surface plasmon fluorescence spectroscopy (Tawa and Knoll, 2004) measurements, deflection of atomic force microscopy cantilevers (Hansen et al., 2001) and frequency shifts of a piezoelectric biosensor (Minunni et al., 2003). Several practical physical aspects of interfacial nucleic acid oligomer hybridization for selective biosensor design have been recently reviewed (Watterson et al., 2002). Since a mismatched duplex is not as stable as that formed by a fully paired one, differentiation between both is possible. Thus, the third strategy relies on controlling experimental variables affecting the hybridization event (stringency) at the transducer-solution interface. As they present different thermal stability, control of temperature may help on differentiation (Caruana and Heller, 1999), even though markers that interact electrostatically with DNA are used (Lapierre et al., 2003). It is also reported in the bibliography that a repulsive potential preferentially denatures mismatched DNA hybrids (Heaton et al., 2001). Initial work from our laboratory showed that the presence of a 25% of formamide in the hybridization buffer allowed a single-base mismatch detection (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2004, Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2005). The use of a concentrated hybridization buffer containing a 45% of formamide and a 5% of dextran sulfate allowed the discrimination of a single-base mismatch (Xu et al., 2001).",

A sequence of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (CoV), the causative agent of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, has been chosen as target. Because of the rate of mortality in patients, it is very important to identify SARS-CoV quickly and accurately. Sequence variations can cause viral transmission from animal to man (Ruan et al., 2003). Moreover, this virus is characterized by the rapid mutation (Li et al., 2003), including point mutations and few short deletions or insertions that have been detected in different infected individuals (He et al., 2004). Here, we describe results of a rigorous study aimed at the better comprehension of the hybridization interaction from the point of view of selectivity. Stringency conditions are carefully revised. Mismatched strands with different location and type of mutation have been tested. Influence of the length has also been studied using oligonucleotide strands longer than those usually reported in the bibliography.",

In one of the approaches, DNA hybridization is carried out under low stringent conditions. On the other hand, mismatches appear to induce perturbations in the electronic structure of the base-pair stack and therefore the behaviour of a redox-active intercalating agent could change. As in this work an enzymatic detection is used, differences in the electron transfer are not seen. Indeed, when hybridization between the 30-mer probe (1.02 \u03bcM) and both, complementary and 3-mismatched strands (4.04 nM), was performed in a 2\u00d7 SSC buffer for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, no discrimination was observed. However, when hybridization took place between the probe and a 30-mer strand with only six common bases, a differentiation was seen. The signal for the non-complementary strand (with six separate complementary points) was a 25 \u00b1 1.2% of the corresponding to the fully complementary. Although there are studies presenting evidence of stable and measurable hybridization between four-base pair complementary sequences (Hansen et al., 2001), the hybridization is generally considered thermodynamically unstable when complementarity exists over only a very short stretch (less than six nucleotides).",

When hybridization step was performed placing 20 \u03bcL of the target solution (containing complementary or three-base mismatched strand) on the sensor surface for 15, 30, 45 and 60 min in 2\u00d7 SSC buffer pH 7 with 25% formamide, an increase in the signals with time was seen as observed in Fig. 1\n. However, slower hybridization kinetic is presented by the sequence that is mismatched with respect to the probe. As the signal enhancement is much higher for the complementary strand, discrimination between both strands could be achieved with time. For 1 h, a 38 \u00b1 1.3% of decrease (comparing the signal of the mismatched strand to that of the complementary one) was obtained. Meanwhile no differentiation is seen for 15 min. Higher times were not tested for avoiding drop evaporation that would cause a decrease in the hybridization signal (Abad-Valle et al., 2005). Furthermore, a longer hybridization time does not have to suppose an increase in selectivity. A time of 30 min is employed by other authors as optimum for the best discrimination between complementary and four-base mismatched targets (Kara et al., 2004), decreasing notoriously the selectivity for higher times. In the discrimination of Helicobacter pylori sequences, when hybridization was permitted to proceed longer than 12 h at 40 \u00b0C, comparable results were obtained for the complementary and mutated sequences (Lapierre et al., 2003). Therefore, 1 h was used as hybridization time for the rest of the assays. Lower hybridization time produced less effect on the discrimination and longer time, apart from producing a decrease in both signals due to evaporation, seemed to act increasing the signal corresponding to the mismatched strand.",

Values of the signals after subtracting background were, 0.064 \u00b1 0.0071, 2.4 \u00b1 0.28 and 3.5 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcA for 3, 2 and 1m-DNA, respectively. Since the signal for the complementary strand is 26.7 \u00b1 3.0 \u03bcA, a 99.8, 91.0 and 86.9% of decrease is, respectively, observed. Although the one-base mismatch strand provides a higher signal than that with three-base mismatches, where 100% of discrimination is almost achieved, c-DNA and 1m-DNA can be discerned perfectly. In this case, only three hydrogen bonds are suppressed.",

            "text": "Selectivity seems to depend on the chemical nature of the mismatching base pair and localization along DNA strand (Ikuta et al., 1987). In the assay commented in the previous paragraph, a 1m-DNA strand with a C\u2014C mismatch located at the centre of the strand was employed. A transversion, with change of a purinic (G) by a pyrimidinic (C) base occurs. This is one of the more favourable discerning cases, taking into account that the stability for base pairs obtained from statistical simulation results. (Allawi and SantaLucia, 1997, Allawi and SantaLucia, 1998a, Allawi and SantaLucia, 1998b, Peyret et al., 1999) follows the sequence: G\u2014C > A\u2014T > G\u2014G > G\u2014T = G\u2014A > T\u2014T = A\u2014A > T\u2014C \u2265 A\u2014C \u2265 C\u2014C. In this case, G\u2014C, which is the more stable interaction, with three hydrogen bonds implied is substituted by a C\u2014C interaction, which is situated at the end of the classification. Hybridizations with other one-base mismatched strands including other type of interaction and different localization were tested. Employing the same experimental conditions as before, signals for two one-base mismatch strands, one with a T\u2014T mismatch in the centre of the strand (position 14) and the other with a C\u2014C mismatch in the 3\u2032-extreme (sequences indicated in Table 1) were recorded. They are compared in Fig. 5\nwith signals obtained for the 1m-DNA with the mismatch in position 15 (C\u2014C type) and the complementary strand. In all the cases one-base mismatch strands can be distinguished from the complementary one. Signals corresponding to the two strands with the mismatch in the centre are similar, although the T\u2014T mismatch strand gives a slightly higher signal. An A\u2014T interaction (two hydrogen bonds) is changed in this case by a T\u2014T one (transversion with change of purinic (A) by pyrimidinic (T)), with less difference in stability. Therefore, the destabilization in DNA duplex will be smaller.",

However, Tawa and Knoll (2004) studied the kinetics of DNA-DNA hybridization by surface plasmon fluorescence spectroscopy and stated that a double strand is found to be more destabilized if a mismatched base pair between the target DNA and the probe DNA is located farther away from the solid sensor surface, facing the solution. In our case, the 3\u2032extreme-mismatch (C\u2014C type) strand signal is clearly higher than centre-mismatch (C\u2014C type) strand one (Fig. 5), which means that although is also distinguished from the fully complementary, it destabilizes less the DNA duplex.",

            "text": "It has been reported that the mechanism of interfacial oligonucleotide hybridization may consist of two separate pathways: by direct diffusion of target DNA in bulk solution directly to immobilized oligonucleotides for selective binding or by non-selective adsorption of the target DNA onto the surface, followed by \u201ctwo-dimensional diffusion\u201d of adsorbed target oligonucleotides to immobilized probes for selective binding (Watterson et al., 2002). In both cases, adsorption and hybridization of smaller targets occur more rapidly than with larger targets. However, as the number of interactions increases with the length of the strands (number of nucleotides), stability is supposedly higher for longer strands. In order to study the influence of the length of the oligonucleotides on the hybridization and on the one-base mismatch differentiation, 40-mer complementary and one-base mismatch (C\u2014C centre) strands were employed as well as the 30-mer ones. The strand sequences used are reported in Table 1. The signal for complementary 40-mer is higher than that of 30-mer, as well as the corresponding mismatched 40-mer and 30-mer strands (data not shown), due to the higher number of interactions involved in the longer strand. On the other hand, the c-DNA/1m-DNA ratio is lower when 40-mer strands are employed. It seems therefore that selectivity depends on the nucleotide bases number. One-base mismatch supposes a 1/30 (3.3%) of the total bases of a 30-mer strand, meanwhile in the case of 40-mer strands it is 1/40 (2.5%). As the influence of the mismatch in the whole molecule is higher the discrimination increases.",

Signal for the first case (40\u201330) is higher than for 30\u201340 (data not shown). In the last case there is a rest of five oligonucleotides that can hinder the hybridization, which anyway takes place very close to the electrode. Meanwhile, in the 40\u201330 hybridization the interaction takes place at the centre of the 40-mer strand. 1-mismatched strands are in both cases discriminated, obtaining for similar reasons a higher signal in the case of hybridization between immobilized 40-mer and a 30-mer strand.

Although the same number of interactions are involved in 40\u201330 than in 30\u201330 hybridization, the presence of a five nucleotide spacer confers a higher mobility to the immobilized strand and favours the hybridization. This result is in agreement with that obtained for a 30\u201330 hybridization experience employing for the immobilized strand either a \u2014(CH2)3 or a \u2014(CH2)6 spacer. The extension of hybridization is slightly higher when a higher spacer (\u2014(CH2)6 instead of \u2014(CH2)3) is employed (data not shown). This is the reason why some genosensors employ in the immobilized strand a nucleotide tail that does not hybridize, with the aim of permitting mobility (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2004), although studies performed with different linker lengths demonstrated that kinetic of electron-transfer process was slower for longer linkers (Taft et al., 2003). In this case, however, the difference in the signal is not so big to justify the difference in price (the strand with a \u2014(CH2)6 spacer almost doubles the price of that with a \u2014(CH2)3 spacer). Moreover, the discrimination of 1 m (C\u2014C type in the centre) DNA is similar for both cases.",

            "text": "Mutations not only consist on the change of bases (base substitution mutations) but also deletions and insertions can occur. Deletion of a guanine base in the exon 5 of the lipoprotein lipase gene has been detected by enzymatic recognition (Wakai et al., 2004). Different phases of the SARS epidemic were related closely with genotypes at different positions with high-mutation rate (Long et al., 2004) and also few short deletions or insertions were detected (He et al., 2004). In this case, when a number of bases different from three (or a multiple) are involved, a change in the reading frame occurs. With the aim of detecting this type of mutation, biotinylated targets with deletion (29-mer) and insertion (31-mer) of one base at the central position (16th) were tested for hybridization. An illustrative scheme is depicted in Fig. 6\n. Guanine is deleted in the first strand and a thymine was introduced in the last one. Results are represented in Fig. 5, from which interesting conclusions can be obtained. Discrimination from complementary strand was always possible but the signal was higher for mutations implying an insertion (30\u201331 hybridization (Fig. 6c)) or deletion (30\u201329 hybridization (Fig. 6d)) than those with a base substitution mutation in the centre (30\u201330 hybridization (Fig. 6b)). This means that when a base substitution occurs, interactions due to 29 bases can be produced but the mismatched pair C\u2014C introduces a higher destabilization. However, when a deletion is present, a probable interaction between 29 bases occurs and the non-complementary base of the 30-mer immobilized strand (citosine) remains unpaired. For the case of the insertion, the probable interaction occurs between 30 bases and the non-complementary base corresponding to the biotinylated 31-mer strand (thymine) is supposedly unpaired. This also explains why the signal for the insertion is higher than the deletion; a higher number of interactions are involved.",

This parameter is important in real sample analysis where DNA concentration is unknown and/or the more adequate DNA concentration can not be chosen. Following the optimized procedure, different c-DNA and 1m-DNA (C\u2014C mismatch in the centre) concentrations were incubated in 2\u00d7 SSC buffer pH 7 with 50% formamide for 60 min. 30-mer target concentrations tested were 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5 nM. The results obtained are showed in Fig. 7\n. Selectivity is achieved in all the tested concentrations. Discrimination varies slightly with target concentration with percentages always superior to 40%, the highest corresponding to 1 nM. It is derived from here that clear differences can be observed between complementary and mismatched strands at a concentration as low as 10 pM, demonstrating that the methodology is not only selective but sensitive to the hybridization. Linearity is obtained for both strands between 0.01 and 1 nM, with slopes of 21.2 and 9.6 \u03bcA/nM for the complementary and mismatched strands, respectively. The detection limit, calculated as the concentration corresponding to a signal that is three times the standard deviation of the intercept, was found to be 5 and 70 pM, respectively, in the order of other found in the bibliography. Miyahara et al. (2002) reports 0.1 nM for the 20-meric mismatch detection system and Kara et al.

It is of relevant interest in the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) as well as for the study of virus mutation. The methodology described here can easily discern hybrids, both fully complementary and unpaired at room temperature. This has been demonstrated employing a sequence of SARS virus as target. After testing many stringency conditions, it was observed that carrying out the interaction between strands in a medium containing a 50% of formamide during 1 h was enough for achieving a high degree of discrimination for all the tested mutated strands.",

One mismatch is detected even if it is located at the extreme situated far from the electrode, being the attenuation of the signal lower that when the substitution occurs near the electrode surface. Hybridization studies carried out between 30-mer strands were compared with those with 40-mer oligonucleotides. The length of the strand influences the hybridization. Experiences with crossed strands revealed the importance of an oligonucleotide tail in the immobilized strand for favouring the mobility and therefore the hybridization. When an aliphatic spacer is used, the augmentation in three carbons implies an increase in the signal for both, complementary and mismatched strands. However, as the magnitude of the increase is similar, discrimination is not enhanced notoriously.",
