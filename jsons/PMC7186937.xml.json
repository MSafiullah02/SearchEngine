As of 31st March 2020, 51 ophthalmologists of all ranks (Medical Officers to Consultants) had been deployed to the SC safely. Recognising that age and co-morbidities result in less favourable outcomes in COVID-19 patients, those of age >60 years old and/or with cardiovascular risk factors [1] were excluded from deployment.",

Chest radiographs were used to detect lung changes consistent with COVID-19 [2]. These were expeditiously reported by a radiologist throughout the day. Majority of those screened received nasopharyngeal diagnostic swabs, which were performed by trained nurses.",
