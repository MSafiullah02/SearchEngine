The emergence of drug-resistant M. tb has made control of TB more difficult. The selective optimization of side activities (SOSA) approach uses old drugs for new pharmacological targets. In the present study by using SOSA approach, we have successfully identified pyrvinium pamoate (PP) which is capable of inhibiting the growth of mycobacteria, including M. tb H37Rv, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), M. tb H37Ra, and drugresistant M. tb clinical isolates in vitro from 1280 known drugs library. The MIC 99 of PP, the minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits more than 99% of M. tb H37Rv and the drug-resistant M. tb clinical isolates, ranges from 1.55 to 4.8 \u00b5g/mL. Importantly, PP could reduce the bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) in lung, spleen and liver tissues, and effectively inhibit inflammatory response in M. tb H37Rv, multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tb and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M.tb-infected mice. Our results clearly show that the PP has the potential application for treatment of TB.",

TB is the world's major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality [2] . One-third of the world's people are infected with M. tb, 8-9 million people suffering from TB each year, and approximately 1.2 million people died from TB in 2018 [2] . M. tb strains mainly infect lung, but also infect many other organs such as kidney, brain, spine, lymph nodes, causing extrapulmonary TB [3] . First-line treatments of TB consist of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA) and ethambutol (EMB) during the first 2 months, continuing with INH and RIF for another 4 months [4] . However, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) M.tb and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M.tb makes the control of TB more difficult. MDR-TB is defined as TB resistant to at least INH and RIF. XDR-TB is defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable drugs (kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin). Because of limited treatment options for MDR-TB and XDR-TB, they pose additional challenges for global TB control efforts. It is urgent to search for new drugs for treatment of TB, including MDR-TB and XDR-TB.",

            "text": "Because high cost and long approval process limits the clinical application of new anti-TB drugs, the selective optimization of side activities (SOSA) was developed as an innovative strategy to solve these problems. Using the SOSA approach, new potential pharmacological targets of old approved drugs may be identified [5, 6] . The safety and pharmacokinetic properties of these old drugs have been well evaluated in humans and animals, so the new biological activities of these approved drugs can be more rapidly and easily applied in clinical practice than new drugs. SOSA has been used in the development of new anti-malarial, antibacterial and antiviral drugs [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In the present study, we used the SOSA approach to screen out a new anti-M. tb drug, pyrvinium pamoate (PP), a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug from the MicroSource (Gaylordsville, CT) library consisting of 1280 drugs and compounds. We have identified that PP is capable of inhibiting multiple mycobacterial species (including M. tb H37Rv, H37Ra, BCG and drugresistant M. tb clinical isolates) growth in vitro and can protect mice against M. tb H37Rv, MDR M. tb and XDR M.tb infection. Murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells were purchased from China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC). To prepare murine peritoneal macrophages, thioglycolate-elicited macrophages were prepared by injecting mice with 3.5 mL of 3% sterile thioglycolate media (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) [12, 13] . After 5 days, peritoneal cells were collected by lavage. The cells were cultured overnight and non-adherent cells were removed. The adherent macrophages were collected and stained with anti-F4/80 antibody for purity analysis. F4/80 + macrophages were greater than 90% of total cells (data not shown). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL STR.",

After 4 weeks or 6 weeks of the treatment, as shown in Figure 5 (A-C), PP treatment significantly reduced the bacterial CFUs in lung, spleen and liver tissues compared with PBS control group, indicating that PP treatment inhibited M. tb H37Rv growth in vivo ( Figure 5(A-C) ). However, PP did not have a more effective antibacterial effect than RIF. PP combined with RIF treatment did not further reduce the CFUs in mice, indicating no synergic effects between PP and RIF ( Figure 5(A-C) ). Histological analysis revealed that M. tb infection caused severe pathological changes and inflammation response in lung, spleen and liver tissues in the M. tb H37Rv group. After treatment with PP, RIF and PP plus RIF, the pulmonary lesion and inflammation alleviated, especially the 6-week treatment with PP markedly and effectively reduced lesion and inflammatory in the lungs compared with the other groups ( Figure 5 (D-F), Supplemental Figure 1 ). Granulomas, inflammatory cells infiltration and thickening of bronchial alveolar wall were observed in the lungs in the PBS control group (Figure 5(D) ). Disorganization of white pulp (WP) and red pulp (RP) in spleens and hepatocyte lesion were also observed in M. tb H37Rv plus PBS control group ( Figure 5(E,F) ). In PP, RIF and PP plus RIF groups, the WP and RP were clearly evident and lymphoid hyperplasia occurred in spleens, indicating the active proliferation of immune cells after the drug treatment ( Figure 5(E) ). Compared with the PBS control group, 6-week treatment of PP and PP plus RIF ameliorated the hepatocyte swelling, indicating that PP has a potential advantage of liver protection over RIF (Supplemental Figure 1) . These results strongly demonstrated that PP treatment reduced severe pathological changes and inflammatory response, and inhibited M. tb H37Rv infection in mice. Table 2 ).",

            "text": "Studies have shown that in the last 40 years, only three new anti-TB drugs have been approved, namely Bedaquiline, Delamanid, and pretomanid worldwide [17] [18] [19] . The burden of TB and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) continues to increase globally. 9% of DR-TB TB patients will develop MDR-TB even XDR-TB [2] . Both MDR-TB and XDR-TB are dangerous medical conditions that can affect patient outcomes, particularly mortality and TB control. Limited therapeutic drug options make the treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB difficult [20] . SOSA provides an attractive strategy, by which new potential pharmacological activity of an old approved drug may be identified. Although some new anti-malarial, antibacterial and antiviral drugs have been developed by SOSA [7] [8] [9] [10] 14, [21] [22] [23] , there is rarely reports about screening and identifying anti-M.tb drugs through this approach. In the present study, we used SOSA approach to screen out a new anti-M. tb drug, PP. We identified PP had remarkable inhibitory effects on M.tb and drug-resistant M. tb in vitro and in vivo. M. smegmatis, BCG and M. tb H37Ra have a similar phenotype and characteristic to virulent M. tb. These mycobacteria have been commonly employed for screening anti-mycobacterial drugs [16, 24] . In the current study, six candidate drugs (PP, BZK, meclizine hydrochloride, suloctidil, doxorubicin and teniposide) were selected from a library of known 1280 drugs and compounds using M. smegmatis as a target for the initial rapid screening. PP and BZK out of the six candidate drugs were identified to be capable of remarkably inhibiting the growth of BCG and M.tb H37Ra in a dose-dependent manner. PP had the lower MIC 99 than BZK had, indicating that PP had the best anti-Mycobacterium effect among these drugs (Figure 2(B) and Table 2 ). Similarly, Kathryn et al used a medium-throughput assay using the Alamar Blue reagent to screen novel inhibitors of M. tb from a library of known 1514 drugs and also identified that five compounds including PP (Primaquine, Pentamide, Nialamide, PP, Thiostrepton and Isoniazid) were active against intracellular M. tb in a macrophage model of infection in vitro activity against M.tb H37Rv [25] .",

            "text": "PP is a cyanine dye and is a classical anthelminthic officially approved by the FDA in 1955 (NDA-9582) [26] . When taken orally, the dose for human commonly was 5 mg/kg/day, up to 350 mg, it is safe even at high doses, and its dose could be up to 35 mg/kg/day for 3-5 days [27, 28] . As a drug against pinworm, the main role of PP is to interfere with the respiratory system of worms, inhibit the uptake of oxygen, increase the anaerobic glycolysis of sugar and impede the absorption of glucose, which causes the parasite to die, but does not kill the eggs [24, 26, 29] . This drug has been replaced by a more effective broad-spectrum anthelmintics in United States, but it is still employed in Europe and Japan [26] . It has been reported that PP inhibited the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH) in the respiratory chain and thus play an anti-tumor effect [30, 31] . We speculated that PP inhibited the growth of M. tb by suppressing NAD+/NADH conversion within the bacteria, but this requires further experimental validation. Recently, some studies reported that PP had pharmacological activity to inhibit the growth of Bartonella henselae infection [32] and coronaviruses replication in vitro [33, 34] . PP has also been reported to have anti-tumor activity [28, [34] [35] [36] [37] . MIC values of M. tb H37Rv and M. tb 8462 are similar, however, in the murine model, PP activity against M. tb H37Rv is greater than against M. tb 8462 (Table 3 and Figure  7) , possibly due to the complexity of M. tb 8462 pathogenesis in vivo. Further study is required to explore the mechanism of PP anti-mycobacterial activity.",

Therefore, the mechanism of PP inhibiting mycobacterial growth might be different from the antimycobacterial mechanisms mediated by INH and RIF. Consequently, PP showed its strong inhibitory effects on the growth of RIF-resistant, INH-resistant and even MDR-resistant M.tb clinical isolates in vitro (Figure 4(B-D) ).",

Therefore, bacterial loads in the organs of infected mice were assessed by plating organ homogenates into medium and were determined by CFU counting (Figures 5-7) . Although the amount of PP used in a murine model (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/day) is much lower than the amount of RIF and EMB used (20 and 100 mg/kg/day respectively), PP significantly inhibited the M. tb infection in vivo compared with PBS control groups ( Figures 5-7) , strongly demonstrating that PP had antimycobacterial activity in vivo. However without evaluation of antimycobacterial activity of PP at various concentrations in vivo, it is difficult to conclude which drug had the strongest anti-TB effects and whether PP had synergic effects with RIF (or EMB). Therefore, anti-TB function of various concentrations of PP should be investigated in a murine M. tb infection model in future studies.",

Second, PP has anti-TB effects in vivo. Third, PP can also inhibit drug-resistant M. tb in vitro and in vivo.

The results showed that the MIC 99 of PP against M. tb H37Rv, M. tb 94789 and M. tb 8462 were 1.5 \u03bcg/mL, 3 \u03bcg/mL, and 0.75 \u03bcg/ mL, respectively (Supplemental",
