There are several different types of immune responses evolved qualitatively to avoid infections e.g., different subsets of T helper cells (e.g., TH1, TH2 and TH17), TFH (follicular helper T cells) [12] that secrete IL-21 (interleukin-21) and differentiates B cells to generate memory B cells [13]. In addition, memory T cells consist of distinct populations of effector memory cells and central memory cells both having distinct effector function along with homing capacity [14].",

The adaptive immune system, in turn, activates innate effector mechanisms in an antigen-specific manner. Several different subsets of functionally distinct dendritic cells are also present and it has now been proved that pattern-recognition receptors and dendritic cells determine the quality and magnitude of acquired immunity [19], [20].

Rabbit anti-Rabies virus Glycoprotein G polyclonal antibody (Catalog Number: CSB-PA14899A0Rb) induces the endocytosis of virion because this polyclonal antibody cause attachment of the virus to host cellular receptors. This fusion triggered by acidic pH of endosome leads to conformational changes in the glycoprotein trimer. This transmembrane glycoprotein is the viral attachment protein that promotes uptake of virus by infected cells, and acts as target of the host humoral immune response to infection [36], [37]. Only two individuals developed rabies out of total 7660 Filipino recipients of F (ab\u2032)2 equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG), (Favirab, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France). As per WHO guidelines none of them had given post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strictly [38], [39]. There are limited therapeutic options available against viruses therefore polyclonal serum therapy will very soon be emerged as potent and effective technique against viral infections based on several researches and clinical studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of animal-derived polyclonal antibody based treatments targeting different venoms, toxins and infections [40]. Currently, immunoglobulin therapy is targeting HPA1 (highly pathogenic avian influenza) viruses e.g., H7N9 and H5N1 are new targets for polyclonal F(ab\u2032)2 immunoglobulin therapy. In mice, in vivo proof-of-concept studies of equine polyclonal F(ab\u2032)2 to HPAI H5N1 (Highly pathogenic avian influenze-H5N1) have been found to prevent infection after an intranasal HPAI H5N1 attack [41]. According to another study, both prior (prophylaxis) or post (therapeutic) administration of four pepsin digested immunoglobulin H5N1 avian influenza equine F(ab\u2032)2 preparations exhibited cytopathic effect against H5N1 infected cultured MDCK (Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney) cells and provided protection to mice [42]. In another study, 100% survival rate was observed in influenza-infected-mice that was intravenously infused with high dose 320 \u03bcg) of anti-influenza IgG [43]. No serious adverse events were observed in phase 1 clinical trial carried out in 21\u201340 years old, 16 healthy human males who were injected with polyclonal F(ab\u2032)2 to HPAI H5N1 [44]. Likewise, many animal based studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of polyclonal antibody therapy against various neglected tropical viral diseases. Unimmunized hamsters injected with West Nile Virus-immune hamster antisera (1 h before and 24 h after a West Nile Virus challenge) were protected from life-threatening West Nile Virus infection [45]. Decrease in disease and deaths were noticed when Marburg and Ebola filoviruses challenged non-human primates were injected with Marburg and Ebola filoviruses specific polyclonal antibodies obtained from non-human primates who had survived flavoviruses exposure [46]. Likewise, similar results were obtained when Ebola infected mice, guinea pigs, and monkeys were injected with polyclonal sera acquired from Ebola immunized mice [47], [48].

Induction of somatic mutations antibody genes leads to production of more diverse, more specific and high affinity antibodies [50].ii)Therapeutic antibody development does not only target extracellular pathogens it has been reported that monoclonal antibodies are also effective against intracellular pathogens e.g., there are some intracellular viruses which can be neutralized by IgA monoclonal antibodies [51].iii)Introduction of antibodies bring about antimicrobial action using different mechanisms such as antibody directed cellular toxicity, toxin and viral neutralization, opsonization, obstruction of microbial attachment and complement activation [52].iv)Pharmacokinetics of immunoglobulin isotype IgG demonstrated it as an effective antimicrobial agent because of half life of 20 days [53] and good tissue penetration power [54]. The half life of murine monoclonal antibodies is shorter in humans and this usually triggers human antibody response. Humanized monoclonal antibodies and human-mouse chimeric antibodies are synthetic antibody preparations made up of human antibody protein sequences that maintain antigen binding region present on heterologous antibody and have longer half-lives [55].\n",

This virus is transmitted vertically, sexually and through blood. HIV infection is associated with progressive exhaustion of CD4+ T cells due to their enhanced destruction and diminished production [61]. With CD4+ T cells, HIV replication leads to cell death, syncytium formation and persistent infection thus creating reservoirs for the virus in many cells and tissues [58]. About 78 million people have suffered from HIV virus and 39 million have died since the beginning of this epidemic [62]. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing world. In 2002, the global prevalence of HIV was 31 million which was increased to 35\u00b73 million in 2012. About 1.5 million deaths were reported in 2013 but the incidence is now decreasing due to expanded access to antiretroviral therapy [61]. Since last many years patients of HIV have been treated with cART (combined antiretroviral therapy) i.e., use of several antiretroviral drugs which suppress the replication of virus but virus is not completely eradicated therefore, trends are now shifting towards practice of immune based treatments. Other limitations associated with combined antiretroviral therapy are transmission of drug resistant HIV strains, emergence of multidrug resistance and cART does not always restore normal CD4+ T cell counts [63].",

To date, RV144 is the only vaccine that has shown some degree of efficacy [67]. Modest efficacy against HIV acquisition was observed in Thai Phase III clinical trial of RV144. Antibody responses against HIV-1 gp120 envelope (Env) were observed in plasma obtained from HIV-1-uninfected individuals administered with ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) prime and AIDSVAX B/E boost. Peptide microarray analysis from six HIV-1 subtypes and group M consensus exhibited that vaccination triggered antibody responses to the V2 loop or second variable of gp120 of multiple subtypes. V2 responses were further evaluated by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance using linear and cyclic V2 loop peptides. Antibody responses against cyclic V2 at 2 weeks postimmunization were noticed in about 97% of vaccinated individuals. RV144 vaccination triggered antibodies that targeted a region of the second loop consisting of conserved epitopes. Early transmission events of HIV-1 involve second loop interactions and supports the evidence that in RV144 anti-V2 antibodies may contribute to viral inhibition [68].",

Two recombinant gp120 vaccines bivalent subtype B/E and bivalent subtype B/B were tested in phase 3 but none of these two vaccines proved efficacious [69]. Both vaccines triggered production of neutralizing and binding antibodies, but neutralizing antibodies were restricted to the strain used in the vaccine [70], the narrow neutralizing response is due to deletion and auto-reactivity of precursor B cells which induce the development of broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies [71]. Post hoc examination exhibited that individuals carrying high concentration of binding and blocking antibodies may develop considerable level of protection from acquisition [72].",

            "text": "HIV infection is associated with cytokine production. Such cytokines influence viral replication and regulate immune system thus, contribute towards the progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Several cytokines involved in immune regulation exert opposite effects, like some stimulate cellular immune function and others induce production of antibodies. AIDS is characterized by diverse disturbances and imbalances in the regulation of cytokine expression. Different cytokines affect expression and replication of HIV differently [88]. Production of T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines e.g., antiviral interferon- \u03b3, interleukin-2 (IL-2) are decreased whereas T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines e.g., interleukin-1, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, tumor necrosis factor are increased. IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IL-16, which inhibit HIV-1 replication in T cells and MDM (monocyte derived macrophages), and IL-10 and IL-13, which inhibit HIV-1 in monocyte derived macrophage act as HIV-suppressor cytokines. TNF-\u03b1, TNF-p, IL-1 and IL-6, which trigger HIV-1 replication in MDM and T cells, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, which stimulates HIV-1 in MDM and IL2, IL-7 and IL-15 which provoke HIV-1 in T cells act as HIV-inductive cytokines. IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor act as bifunctional cytokines because of both inhibitory and stimulatory impacts on HIV-1 infection [89], [90], [91]. Therefore, cytokine therapy may suggest new ways to prevent progression to AIDS. HIV-1 patients experience significant decline in CD4+ T cells but IL-2 therapy has been shown to improve CD4+ counts [92] the findings of this study were in contrast to previous studies which suggested that IL-2 had no supplementary benefits in HIV-1 patients [93]. Levy et al. have also demonstrated considerable rise in CD4 cells in HIV-1 infected individuals administered with IL-2 in combination with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Na\u00efve and memory CD4 cells count, natural killer cells, lymphocyte expression of CD25 and CD28 was higher in IL-2 group compared to controls [94]. Administration of IL-7 in HIV-1 infected individuals led to expansion of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and IL-7 receptor alpha chain CD127+. rhIL-7 amplify the numbers of na\u00efve and central memory T cells [95]. Marked decrease in the production of virus-induced interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 [96] and interferon-\u03b1 producing cells (IPCs) has been observed in HIV patients. This study suggested a direct link of interferon-\u03b1 producing cells (IPCs) with control of HIV replication [97]. Phase II/III study showed lower rate of HIV progression in 40 of 122 IFN-\u03b1 vaccine recipients [98]. Another study involving 34 patients of asymptomatic HIV infection administered with IFN-\u03b1 showed decrease in HIV load. Of the 32 study patients followed after study (range, 5\u201333 months), no patients in the IFN-\u03b1 group developed an AIDS compared with 5 patients in the placebo group [99].",

Vaccine trials in animal models has demonstrated that HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies are potent enough to suppress HIV infection [100]. VRC01 is human monoclonal antibody which targets CD4 binding site of human immunodeficiency virus gp120 [101]. Likewise, other monoclonal antibodies such as PGT121 [102], 3BNC117 [103], R1C7, A4F6, R5C4, R5F6 [104] CCR5 [103] and 10-1074 [105] have been proved effective in suppression of HIV infection in animal models. Monoclonal antibody A32 acts as a potent mediator of ADCC (antibody dependent cellular toxicity) activity and plays an important role in preventing HIV acquisition [106]. Accumulating evidences suggest that administration of monoclonal antibodies to humanized mice resulted in suppression of viral load. Likewise, injection of cocktail of HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies, as well as the single glycan-dependent monoclonal antibody PGT121 caused dramatic decline of plasma viraemia in rhesus monkey chronically infected with simian-human-immuno-deficiency virus [107]. Human monoclonal antibody F105 has successfully passed through phase I clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00001105). F105 binds with CD4 binding site of HIV-1 gp120 and neutralizes laboratory and clinical HIV isolates [108]. Recently another antibody 3BNC117 has been reported to boost up humoral immunity against HIV-1 in animals and humans [109]. Human based follow up clinical studies and the complete evaluation of therapeutic potential of these monoclonal antibodies is currently under way.",

Vaccines formulation is based on use of virus-like particles originated from L1 proteins that resemble HPV but cannot multiply due to absence of genetic material [122]. HPV vaccines are potent enough to eradicate malignant tumors and pre-existing lesions by inducing cellular immunity directed against HPV-infected cells which express early viral proteins like E6 and E7 [123].

            "text": "The development of efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine against herpes virus infections has proven complicated due to complex life cycle (latency) of herpes simplex and poorly understood mechanism of immune control at primary and recurrent stage of disease. Previous studies have described that activated innate immunity and virus-specific T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines (like gamma interferon) prevent recurrent disease. Whereas, regulatory (suppressor) T cells and Th2 cytokines (e.g., interleukin-10 [IL-10]) down regulate this immune profile thereby, allowing the establishment of recurrent disease and replication of reactivated virus. Therefore, an efficacious vaccine must stimulate Th1 immunity and be defective in Th2 cytokine production especially IL-10 [157]. Gylcoprotiens gD and gB activate CD4+ T cells and ICP27 activate CD8+ T cells [158]. These facts form the basis of development of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein-d-subunit vaccine with adjuvant alum and 3-O-deacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A which induce helper T cells Th1. The results of clinical trials phase I/II exhibited that glycoprotein D vaccine was efficacious against genital herpes in HSV-1 and HSV-2 sero-negative females whereas, not effective in men and those women who were HSV-1 sero-positive and HSV-2 sero-neagtive [159]. Another study suggested secreted glycoprotein G of HSV-2 as highly efficacious novel agent for development of prophylactic vaccine to control HSV-2 associated infections [160]. In an experiment carried out in guinea pigs, recombinant HSV-1 glycoproteins gB and gD formulated with an adjuvant were used as immunotherapeutic agents in order to control recurrent genital herpes and resulting increase in antibody titer supported the fact that gBgD immunotherapy could be effective against HSV associated genital infections [161].",
