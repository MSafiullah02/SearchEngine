Echocardiography Room -Since most echocardiography rooms are not equipped with negative ventilation, a room with a window facing outdoors is preferred in order to maintain natural ventilation, especially for confirmed or suspicious cases.(2) -During echocardiography, the door to the corridor should remain closed and the window to the outdoor area should be half-open. -It is recommended to limit the presence of the staff in the room when a suspicious/definite COVID-19 patient is undergoing echocardiography. -Large hospitals and especially, referral centers for COVID-19 patients should dedicate 1 room with 1 echocardiography machine for suspicious/definite COVID-19 patients. Note that any other machines in the specified room should be either used for COVID-19 patients or be relocated. -After each echocardiography, all equipment in direct and indirect contact with the patient, and the room should be properly disinfected as per local Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC)",
