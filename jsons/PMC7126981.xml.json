            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses are arthropod-borne, Western Hemisphere alphaviruses in the family Togaviridae (Walton and Grayson, 1988). Individual VEE virus isolates are designated as either epizootic or enzootic based on origin. Epizootic strains, isolated from sporadic equine epizootics and epidemics, multiply to high titer in non-immune equines and are transmitted indiscriminately by suitable mammalophilic or ornithophilic mosquito vectors to humans, domestic livestock, wild mammals, and birds (Sudia and Newhouse, 1975). The only interepizootic \u2018reservoirs\u2019 identified thus far have been in the form of incompletely formalin-inactivated vaccines (Kinney et al., 1992a). In contrast, enzootic strains are readily isolated in discrete geographic foci sharing common elevations, climate, and vegetation (Johnson and Martin, 1974). Elegant early field work implicated Culex (primarily subgenus Melanoconion) mosquitoes and wild rodent or marsupial hosts in enzootic transmission cycle maintenance (Chamberlain et al., 1964, Galindo et al., 1966, Grayson and Galindo, 1968).",

The more divergent enzootic strains occupy remaining antigenic classifications, and are for the most part equine benign. However, intrathecally inoculated subtype ID and IE strains cause a fulminant encephalitis in horses (Dietz et al., 1978), and recent equine outbreaks in southern Mexico with 40\u201350% case-fatality rates yielded subtype IE strains (Oberste et al., 1998).",

Initially, the majority of the nonstructural region was amplified using three overlapping sense/antisense amplimer combinations (designations include the 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide genomic position in TRD virus, standard ambiguity code is R=A/G, Y=C/T, H=A/C/T, M=A/C, D=A/G/T, K=G/T, V=A/C/G, B=C/G/T, N=A/C/G/T):Additional degenerate and virus-specific primers (sequences available on request) were designed to fill in sequence gaps. The infrequency of invariant neighboring wobble position nucleotides in the nonstructural region required synthesis of more degenerate primers than were used for the 26S mRNA region (Kinney et al., 1998). All initial priming sites in the genome were derived as internal sequences in other amplicons, and both strands of the amplified cDNA were sequenced.",

Resequencing using cDNA amplified from low-passage (equine-1/mouse-1, 1961 seed) virus that had not been plaque-purified revealed an A at this position, as is found in TC-83 and every VEE virus strain. A partial MENA virus nsP3-nsP4 coding sequence, GenBank accession no. U34978 (Oberste et al., 1996), is identical to sequence obtained using our laboratory stock of MENA virus. Conflicts with a previous partial C-terminal nsP4 coding sequence determination, ranging from one nucleotide difference in MUC virus to 11 differences in 78V-3531 virus, are likely due to sequencing methods employed (Weaver et al., 1992).",

The VEE virus nsP2 is divided (dotted line) into N- and C-terminal domains after the isoleucine residue at position 456 (numbering based on TRD virus), corresponding to the final residue in the alignment of SIN nsP2 with certain single-stranded RNA plant viral helicases (Ahlquist et al., 1985) and the region where the N-terminus of the SIN nsP2 proteinase domain was mapped using infectious clone deletion mutants (Hardy and Strauss, 1989). Comparative analysis of VEE virus sequences (see below) indicates that selection pressures are different in N- and C-terminal portions of this protein. The VEE virus N-terminal nsP3 domain ends at residue 330, a conserved aliphatic residue following an invariant tyrosine residue.

EEE and SIN genotypes (Strauss et al., 1984, Weaver et al., 1993) are added to the overall VEE virus consensus sequence to emphasize certain trends. For any particular VEE virus nsP coding sequence, the majority of nucleotide changes are silent, occurring initially at the codon wobble positions and continuing until the wobble positions are essentially saturated, as noted previously in other alphavirus sequence comparisons (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). For example, the nsP4 coding sequences of subtype IAB, IC, ID, and II strains share only 86% nucleotide identity yet are virtually identical at the deduced amino acid level. It is clear from every generated consensus sequence that individual nsPs (and protein domains) diverge at different rates. The VEE virus N-terminal nsP2 domain, for example, is much more conserved than the C-terminal nsP2 domain. This divergence is even more striking when SIN and EEE virus nsP2 sequences are included in the comparison.",

Of the more than 3000 variant nucleotide positions in the VEE virus nonstructural region alignment, 70% are in the third position, 21% in the first position, and 9% in the second position of the codon. Because multiple substitutions at the same position increase as more divergent VEE virus strain sequences are added to the alignment, codon wobble position nucleotides become misleading and contribute little more than background noise to parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis. This is manifested in inconsistent branching orders and low bootstrap values for phylogenetic trees inferred from individual or combined nsP coding sequences. Substituting R or Y for codon wobble position purines or pyrimidines is of little benefit, due to the predominance of four-codon amino acid families in VEE virus nsP sequences. Thus, the only appropriate VEE virus character sets for parsimony-based analysis are deduced amino acid sequences or codon first and second position nucleotides. Maximum parsimony analysis (Swofford, 1993) using polyprotein P1234 sequences or corresponding codon first and second position nucleotides produce the same topology as that shown in Fig. 4\n. The tree in Fig. 4 is derived from combined nonstructural and structural region codon first and second position nucleotides, with EEE virus strain 82V-2136 (Weaver et al., 1993) serving as the outgroup. This tree is well-supported by bootstrap resampling (Felsenstein, 1985), as only two partitions are present in fewer than 70% of resampled trees. An identical branching pattern is again reproduced when combined deduced nonstructural and structural region amino acid sequences are used, although bootstrap proportions in this case are somewhat lower (data not shown).",

Essential features of the alphavirus 51-nt CSE structure, for example, are confirmed or clarified by 51-nt CSE sequences reported here. Substitutions in putative stem structures of enzootic VEE virus strains represent natural experiments identical to SIN mutants constructed in vitro (Niesters and Strauss, 1990a). The requirement for strict maintenance of stem length in the second stem\u2013loop of the 51-nt CSE as demonstrated by anti-pairing changes in O\u2019Nyong-nyong virus (Levinson et al., 1990) is apparently violated by MENA virus, which could form a stem lengthened by two base pairs (Fig. 2B). An equivalent calculated free energy for the MENA virus hairpin, due to the presence of a non-canonical G-U pair within the putative helix (Tinoco et al., 1973), may indicate that overall stability, rather than absolute stem length, determines possible nucleotide changes.",

While this definition is more appropriate for purely structural RNA molecules, the alphavirus 51-nt CSE second stem is \u2018proven\u2019 and the VEE virus 20-nt palindrome stem supported by available sequences. In VEE virus, both CSEs are located in the only regions of the genome characterized by high concentrations of invariant wobble position nucleotides, and both may be part of more extensive secondary structures. The proposed involvement of the 51-nt CSE in a large 5\u2032 terminal secondary structure (Niesters and Strauss, 1990a) has been mentioned. The 20-nt palindrome is within the region (nt 735-1255) corresponding to the putative SIN packaging signal (Weiss et al., 1989). Experiments using SIN RNA transcribed from progressively truncated cDNA clones rule out the palindrome as the exclusive packaging signal (Weiss et al., 1989), but capsid binding may require a secondary structure which includes this palindrome.",

Because it would be helix-disruptive, the G-to-A mutation at nt 3 contributing to attenuation of the TC-83 strain (Fig. 2) indirectly supports a putative VEE virus 5\u2032NTR stem (Dubuisson et al., 1997). However, while the contribution of this mutation to TC-83 attenuation is well-established (Kinney et al., 1993), the contribution of this mutation to attenuation as a result of 5\u2032NTR secondary structure disruption awaits demonstration. As evidence from SIN 5\u2032NTR and 51-nt CSE mutants indicates (Niesters and Strauss, 1990a, Niesters and Strauss, 1990b), nucleotide changes can influence a secondary structure model and a viral genome disproportionately. Preservation of \u2018proximal\u2019 nucleotides in the putative SIN 5\u2032NTR stem (Niesters and Strauss, 1990b), or preservation of the SIN 51-nt CSE linear nucleotide sequence over and above preservation of amino acid sequence and stem\u2013loop free energy (Niesters and Strauss, 1990a), may be more important determinants of viral fitness than secondary structure preservation. For another member of the Togaviridae, preservation of secondary structure may not even be required. The rubella virus 51-nt CSE homolog conserves many alphavirus codon wobble position nucleotides and deduced amino acid residues despite lacking an apparent alphavirus-like secondary structure (Dominguez et al., 1990).",

Given the plasticity of alphavirus C-terminal nsP3 domain size (Strauss et al., 1988, LaStarza et al., 1994a), the infrequency of deletion events and predominance of duplication events in VEE virus C-terminal nsP3 domains is noteworthy. A TRD virus C-terminal nsP3 domain direct repeat secondary structure has been proposed (Davis et al., 1989), and related structures can be drawn for the duplications found in enzootic VEE virus strains. The mechanism for the generation of duplications may be related to the sequences themselves, as G+C content analysis or secondary structure modeling of C-terminal nsP3 coding sequences stripped of direct repeats fail to reveal sequence qualities peculiar to this region that would favor polymerase slippage or template switching.",
