            "text": "Liver disorders have been classified in the high priority areas of health care. According to an estimate by the World Health Organization, approximately 500 million people of the world are suffering from a severe form of liver disorders, that is, chronic hepatitis (Al\u2010Asmari et al., 2014). Medicine of herbal origin may serve as a feasible therapy for the prevailing liver problems because of their safety, easier availability, cost effectiveness, and environment friendliness (Izzo, Hoon\u2010Kim, Radhakrishnan, & Williamson, 2016). Medicinal plants have acquired importance in healthcare system throughout the world for their proven and effective therapeutic properties (Helmst\u00e4dter & Staiger, 2014). An estimated 80% of the world's population is relying on medicines that contain compounds of herbal origin (Ekor, 2013). The International Union for Conservation of Nature has suggested that approximately 50,000 to 80,000 flowering plants are used for medicinal purposes (Chen, Li, Ren, & Hu, 2016). Many factors regarding these medicines are important. Herbal medicines are claimed to both treat and prevent diseases, which adds to a deep belief that these treatments are safe because they are \u201cnatural and gentle\u201d and therefore, a harmless alternative to the conventional medicine. Moreover, the latter may sometimes cause disappointing results and undesirable side effects in patients (Izzo et al., 2016). In addition, the less expensive herbal products are often not subject to strict regulations and medication prescribed by a physician or other qualified practitioners (Hunter & Hegele, 2017). Although medicinal plants have been used globally, their wider usage is limited to a few countries like Japan, India, China, Pakistan, Thailand, Iran, and some African countries (Bahmani et al., 2014; Iwu, 2014; Li, 2016; Sivasankari, Anandharaj, & Gunasekaran, 2014). Other countries are also encouraging the use of plant\u2010based medicinal products in their healthcare systems. For example, Natural Health Product Regulations of Canada for the plant\u2010based product in healthcare encourages usage of modern technology and evidence\u2010based scientific support towards promoting medicinal plants and the associated products (Tomlinson & Akerele, 2015). A major concern of scientists investigating herbal treatments is that the chemical composition of the plants contributing to their biological effects is mostly undetermined (Ling et al., 2009).",

There are many herbs having ingredients that are potential sources of medicine for the treatment of liver diseases having various modes of actions and bioactivities (Babu, Bhuvaneswar, Sandeep, Ramaiah, & Rajendra, 2017; Gnanadesigan, Ravikumar, & Anand, 2017; Pereira, Barros, & Ferreira, 2016). However, several of them are well\u2010studied for their bioactive components and the mechanism of hepatoprotective activity. In the current review, we have selected some of these compounds for which elaborate detail about hepatoxicity is available in literature in the form of either in vivo studies, study into biochemical parameters and bioactive compounds. This article highlights the possible ways of inducing hepatoxicity in mice models and encompasses the mechanisms in which certain medicinally important plants perform their hepatoprotective activity. The article further aims to summarize studies conducted on the composition, pharmacology, and nature of the selected plants in the light of possible mechanism deduced from experimental trials.",

Several studies have manipulated mice models to induce hepatotoxicity and then treat those induced liver diseases using herbs and herbal products (Figure 1). This approach provides insight into how hepatitis and other liver diseases are caused. However, for many plants, their mechanism of action against hepatotoxic agents is not well\u2010documented. The common prototype applied for hepatoprotective drug screening is the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced hepatic injury (Rodrigues et al., 2016). As CCl4 have been reported for its damaging effects on the liver because on metabolism by P450, it produces free radicals (Johnston & Kroening, 1998). These free radicals cause lipid peroxidation by binding to DNA, proteins, or lipids (Yasuda, Izumi, Shimada, Kobayakawa, & Nakanishi, 1980). The degree of hepatic injury is evaluated by the higher level of biochemical parameters that is ascribed to the production of trichloromethyl free radicals which eventually causes lipids peroxidation present in cellular membrane (Chen, Yu et al., 2016). Figure 2 shows the different strategies applied for studying the in vivo effects of induced hepatotoxicity in mice models.",

The main causes of liver cirrhosis are alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic viral hepatitis (B and C). Although generally, hepatic inflammation is caused by factors such as oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA methylation (Ali et al., 2016; Lam et al., 2016).",

In rats fed with a high\u2010fat diet, flavonoids were assessed for their inhibition on steatohepatitis (also known as fatty liver disease; Jia et al., 2017). Oral administration, in a dose\u2010dependent manner, repressed the levels of total cholesterol, free fatty acid, triglyceride, and low\u2010density lipoprotein\u2010cholesterol in the liver and/or serum. Four hundred milligrams per kilogram total flavonoid content from L. coreana almost stopped the formation of steatosis. At the same time, peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor \u03b1, a protein linked with amplified SOD, and reduced malondialdehyde levels were upregulated in rat liver treated with the flavonoids from L. coreana. Flavonoid treatment for 200 and 400 mg/kg alleviated the levels of ALP, ALT, AST, \u03b3\u2010, triglyceride, \u03b3\u2010glutamyltransferase, and total cholesterol in liver and serum. On the other hand, SOD and glutathione peroxidase were increased in fat suspension steatohepatitis model of rat. Thus, L. coreana is a potent hepatoprotective herb with flavonoids as their bioactive components (Petruzziello, Marigliano, Loquercio, & Cacciapuoti, 2016).",

Furthermore, elevation of mitochondrial glutathione concentration was found to be linked with \u03b3\u2010schisandrin hepatoprotective mechanism. The increase in vitamin C concentration in the liver of test animals upon treatment with \u03b3\u2010schisandrin also validates its hepatoprotective ability. Another individual lignin, Schisandrin B was also found to counter oxidative harm to liver tissues (Thandavarayan et al., 2015; Xin et al., 2017). In one scientific study, the hepatoprotective mechanism against acetaminophen\u2010induced liver injury of six Schisandra lignans (deoxyschisandrin, Schisantherin A, Schisandrin B, Gomisin A, Schisandrin C, and schisandrin) was elucidated. The hepatoprotective ability of these lignins was found to be associated with inhibition of cytochrome\u2010mediated bioactivation (Jiang et al., 2015). Furthermore, another mechanistic study investigated the hepatoprotective effect of Schisandra polysaccharide in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease mice models. The results demonstrate potential down regulation of hepatic lipogenesis genes and LXR\u03b1/SREBP\u20101c/FAS/ACC and SREBP\u20102/HMGCR signaling pathways in the liver (Wang, Song et al., 2016).",

Furthermore, it was found that the ethanol solution extract prevented centribular hepatic necrosis and acetaminophen\u2010induced toxicity of liver. The ethanol solution extract was further found to also elevate the level of potential antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. In another study by the same group, nanoparticles formulation of C. chinensis seeds ethanol solution extract was found to be more effective in rats with acetaminophen\u2010induced hepatotoxicity (Yen, Wu, Lin, Cham, & Lin, 2008).
