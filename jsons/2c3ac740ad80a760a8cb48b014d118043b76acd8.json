Biofire Film Array (bioM\u00e9rieux), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use, is increasingly common in clinical laboratories in the United States, particularly for respiratory and enteric pathogen detection. The entire testing procedure occurs within a single instrument without a separate step for nucleic acid extraction. Only a single sample can be tested at one time, making throughput a major drawback for implementation of this technology in surveillance studies. In addition, the panels are limited to a defined set of pathogen targets and cannot be customized to allow screening for pathogens specific to a geographic region or patient population. Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) syndromic panels are commercially available multiplex real-time PCR panels amenable to surveillance applications. FTD respiratory panel 21 was recently used in a large multisite study for respiratory pathogens [4] , and diagnostic kits for a range of syndromes are available from this manufacturer. However, assay setup and analysis is complex and prone to operator error, in particular due to the open nature of the system in which the potential for cross-contamination is high.

This testing was performed to ensure no false amplification due to oligomerization of oligonucleotides, nonspecific priming events, or lack of specificity for target sequence within targeted genus, species, or strain type. Analytical sensitivity (determination of lower limit of detection) was independently determined for each assay in both singleplex and, when applicable, multiplex format by testing at least 8 replicates each of a 10-fold dilution series of specific total nucleic acid ranging from 0.1 fg/\u00b5L to 1 ng/\u00b5L.

In particular, these TACs were used to assess the impact of reduced reaction volume (25\u00d7 smaller on TAC compared to 96-well plate format used for assay development), lyophilization of oligonucleotides on microfluidic array, and performance and compatibility of differentially labeled oligonucleotide probes. Initially, triplex reactions were evaluated with probes differentially labeled at the 5\u2032 position with FAM, HEX, and Cy5, all with 3\u2032 modification with a Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) fluorescent quencher molecule. Despite successful performance in 96-well plate format, Cy5-labeled probes performed poorly on TACs; in some cases these assays were unable to be interpreted. We evaluated a newer reporter dye (ABY, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to replace Cy5. ABY-labeled probes were modified with a different quencher molecule (QSY) and exhibited superior performance compared to 5\u2032Cy5/3\u2032BHQ both in 96-well and TAC microfluidic card formats. However, ABYlabeled probes were incompatible with HEX-labeled probes in multiplex format due to emission spectral overlap of the 2 fluorophores and inadequate quenching of signal using BHQ compared to QSY. Assay performance was improved by replacing 5\u2032HEX/3\u2032BHQ probes with 5\u2032VIC/3\u2032QSY versions, eliminating spectral cross-talk for multiplex reaction formats on TAC. We also evaluated probe concentrations using the optimal probe quencher modifications, including QSY and ZEN double-quenched probes (IDT). The amplification signal was substantially improved with both 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032QSY and 5\u2032FAM/ ZEN/3\u2032IBQ probes compared to 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032BHQ probes; the intensity of FAM fluorescence was approximately 10-fold higher for QSY-quenched compared to BHQ-quenched probes (data not shown). Use of these quenchers allowed for a lower final concentration of probe to be used in multiplex reactions when using 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032QSY or 5\u2032FAM/ZEN/3\u2032IBQ, saving on cost. In addition to the evaluation in 96-well plate format, a batch of TACs was manufactured with varying permutations of probe modifications (reporters, quenchers, and reaction concentrations) to compare performance or 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032QSY, 5\u2032FAM/ ZEN/3\u2032IBQ, and 5\u2032FAM/3\u2032BHQ in both singleplex and multiplex reaction formats on the TAC microfluidic system. For most assays, 5\u2032HEX/3\u2032BHQ was replaced with 5\u2032VIC/3\u2032QSY unless the assay required an internal quencher, in which case 5\u2032HEX/ ZEN/3\u2032IBQ was used.

The dataset includes either 2 or 4 replicates per target, depending on card type, that must be interpreted to arrive at a single target interpretation for each specimen. Additionally, some pathogens may have multiple single target interpretations that must be interpreted as a group to generate a multitarget result, typically representing the subspecies or other characteristics identified below the pathogen level (Supplementary Table 1 ). While analysis and generation of final results from the .xlsx file can be done manually, the process is tedious and potentially error prone.

Validation errors result in rejection of the file with an email notification sent to the submitter with all validation errors. Once the card passes initial validation checks, the data from the card is processed by an algorithm that generates single-target replicate and multitarget interpretations and stores all replicate data and interpretations in a relational database. Single-target replicates are interpreted using the same pattern for all targets and all cards. If \u22651 positive replicate for a target exists, the interpretation is positive for that target.

One limitation of TAC is that the pathogens included in each panel are selected a priori, creating a potential bias toward identifications, although specimens are stored in a central repository and can be tested later for additional pathogens of interest or using newer test methods. The specimen types collected for testing are diverse and complex matrices requiring specialized specimen processing. We addressed this through focused development of specimen processing and nucleic acid extraction protocols, although these efforts were limited by the material available to use for validation, including clinical specimens. In the case of a few assays, we were unable to perform a comprehensive validation using clinical specimens, especially for rare pathogens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Even greater challenges exist beyond these technical and logistical issues. Aside from the technical challenges, the simple abundance of data presents an inherent challenge. The development of a custom data portal for CHAMPS has enabled management of the vast amount of data generated for each case. In some cases, nucleic acids from a large number of potential pathogens are detected, particularly in nonsterile site specimens. Attributing detected organisms to cause of death is extremely complex as detection of pathogen nucleic acid does not necessarily indicate a contribution to disease state or to death. Many potentially pathogenic organisms may be present in a long-term carriage state, especially in upper respiratory and gastrointestinal specimens, yet it is nearly impossible to distinguish this status using molecular detection methods alone. In addition, microorganisms may disseminate from the original site of infection during the time leading up to and following death. However, TAC results are a highly valuable adjunct to postmortem tissue pathology studies helping to suggest the need for special stains and immunohistochemistry testing (see Martines et al in this supplement). Further evaluation will be performed to investigate the extent of perimortem dissemination to pathogen detection and cause of death determination, including the impact of time from death to completion of the MITS procedure.

Culture-independent diagnostic tests represent the application of these advanced technologies to clinical diagnostics and disease surveillance. As CHAMPS moves forward, we will continue to pursue emerging advanced technologies for application to MITS specimen testing. Continual improvements in reagents, equipment, and analysis pipelines for targeted resequencing or metagenomics may enable more widespread use of these approaches in resource-limited settings, and CHAMPS sites are interested in pursuing their implementation. Deep sequencing analysis of specimens in which no pathogens are identified using TAC may provide a good starting point for implementation of these methods. However, next-generation sequencing methods are currently costprohibitive in many settings. Other technical barriers, such as laboratory infrastructure, equipment technical support, and reagent procurement may be restricting factors. Access to bioinformatics resources and high performance computing capacity is a major obstacle to implementation.
