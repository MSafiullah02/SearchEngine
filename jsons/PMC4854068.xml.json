Substantive reviews and guidelines identified on the subject have been referenced. Relevant data on international guidelines and the best practices were obtained and put into context for the Saudi Arabia health services.[22232425262728] These data were reviewed by SCIPV, a group of Saudi experts in the field of respiratory and infectious diseases. Consensus among the SCIPV members was followed whenever there was a lack of evidence. We graded the evidence into four categories:",

Pneumococcal serotypes causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and IPD differ between various geographical areas, and the distribution seems to be dependent on the period the studies were conducted and the use of pneumococcal vaccines in the geographical locations.[3233] To the panel knowledge, no large-scale controlled studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia on the relative importance of pneumococcal infections and the true burden of pneumococcal infections is unknown.

Another study from three hospitals in Mecca city reported that S. pneumoniae was the main isolate from age groups <10 and >40 with an incidence rate of 36.8% and 57.9, respectively.[35] In a report from a university hospital in Riyadh conducted between 2000 and 2004, 62% of pneumococcal isolates from all age groups and 83% of isolates from children aged <2 years were included in the PCV7.[36] In a recent large prospective population-based study of CAP in hospitalized adults in the USA, a pathogen was identified in 38% of patients and S. pneumoniae was the responsible pathogen in 5% of them.[2]",

Other studies between 2005 and 2010 have reported IPD in children aged <5 years with 66% and 62% resistance to penicillin and erythromycin strains, respectively.[45] Based on international experience, the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines has been shown to reduce the rate of the disease, especially those caused by drug-resistant strains due to the protective action of the vaccine against serotypes responsible for drug resistance.[46]",

The capsule is an essential virulence factor and means of evading the immune system by resisting phagocyte killing.[49] On the basis of differences in the composition of this capsule, over >90 distinct pneumococcal serotypes have been identified. In general, immunity following infection is serotype-specific, but cross-protection between related serotypes could occur. Antibodies directed to the capsule polysaccharide are highly protective and they play a central role in protection. They also form the basis for immunogenic and protective immune responses generated by current vaccines. Available pneumococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides from common serotypes that are associated with severe invasive disease. It has been noted that the distribution of serotypes that cause pneumococcal diseases varies based on many factors that include age, disease type and severity, and geographic region.[49]",

Common clinical presentations of IPD include septicemia, bacterial meningitis, lobar pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, peritonitis, cellulitis, myositis, periorbital cellulitis, and abscesses.[113653] IPD affects mainly extremes of ages: <12 months and \u226565 years. Other groups who are more likely to develop IPD are shown in Table 1. In a systemic review of literature from the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt that covered the period between 1990 and 2007, the incidence range of IPD in children aged \u22655 years was 3.4\u201353.5/100,000 population.[54] IPD presented as bacteremia in 61\u2013100% and meningitis in 3\u201325% for children aged <2 years.

This is called asymptomatic carriage where S. pneumoniae colonize the upper respiratory tract in 5\u201310% of healthy adult and 20\u201340% of healthy children.[52] Carriage usually requires frequent or prolonged close contact and crowdedness and is associated with young age, female gender, winter season, and exposure to antibiotics during the previous month.[5556] Susceptibility to infection occurs more in situ ations such as malnutrition, fatigue, or intercurrent viral infection and seasonal variation with a tendency toward peaking in the winter.[57] After colonization in the nasopharyngeal, infection of nearby sites may develop. Alternatively, infection might also be caused by direct aspiration into the bronchial tree causing pneumonia or by hematogenous invasion leading to bacteremia, meningitis, or infection of other distant organs.[52]",

Children under the age of two respond poorly to this polysaccharide vaccine. As PPSV does not stimulate immunological memory, the induced immunity may wane after about 5 years in healthy persons; therefore, PPSV23 requires periodic revaccination to maintain protective efficacy.[60] Of the isolated strains from patients with IPD that were collected in Riyadh between 2001 and 2002, the overall coverage of the serotypes included in PPSV was 84% among adults.[57] PPSV23 efficacy against IPD has been estimated to be 75% among healthy elderly \u2265 65 year.[61] It was also estimated to range between 65% and 84% in certain persons at high risk, such as those with diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary diseases, and asplenia.[62] In addition, a Cochrane review supports the recommendation to administer PPSV23 to prevent IPD in adults.[63] Of note, PPSV23 has limited efficacy in children <2 years, nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, otitis media, exacerbations of COPD, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic alcoholism.[646566]",

PCV7 was then replaced by PCV13 in 2011.[8] PCV13 is covalently linked to a nontoxic protein which renders the polysaccharide antigenic in infants and toddlers.[6869] It was approved in 2011 for the use in adult \u226550 years.[70] PCV13 contains polysaccharide from 13 common capsular types (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). The 13 serotypes account for about 91% of the pneumococcal isolates that cause serious infection in Saudi Arabia.[45] However, two recent reports from Saudi Arabia have shown the serotype coverage of PCV13 to be 81% and 87%.[7172] In the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults, PCV13 was effective in preventing vaccine-type pneumococcal among adults, bacteremic and nonbacteremic CAP, and vaccine-type IPD.[73]",
