By the end of 2017, China's HSR network had grown to 25,000 km (China Ministry of Transport, 2018) and is planned to increase to 30,000 km by 2020 (China Ministry of Transport, 2017). It is expected that the temporal and spatial changes facilitated by the HSR system (Chen, 2019) will both booster domestic tourism flows and generate significant changes in the structure of tourism flows (Yin et al., 2019). Theoretically, the compression of travel time and space induced by short-distance HSR services provides opportunities for adjoining cities to be regarded as the \u201csame city\u201d. In practice, however, adjoining cities tend to operate independently, and each can be expected to adopt strategies that will increase its competitiveness vis \u00e0 vis the other city. Understanding the current spatial relationship between adjacent cities and the impact potential impact of HSR has important implications in relation to collaboration on tourism policy development and planning.",

Empirical studies conducted in China show that there has been an increase in accessibility of all cities and regions along HSR lines (Liu and Zhang, 2018). Research has also found that regional economic disparity has decreased since the introduction of HSR (Chen and Haynes, 2017), with the exception of a number of central-Eastern cities where there is some evidence that they might gained greater accessibility benefits from HSR than other regions (Cao et al., 2013). HSR promotes wider destination choice, which can create significant changes in the spatial distribution of tourism resources (Wang et al., 2012).",

This study aims to contribute to the transport and tourism literatures by addressing this gap by assessing the impact of high-speed railway on tourism spatial structures between two adjoining metropolitan cities. We chose Beijing and Tianjin for this study based on the size of the two cities, their adjacent location, well-developed tourism infrastructure, and the length of time that HSR has been operating (Wang et al., 2018). Specifically, this study attempts to understand: a) the impact that HSR can have on the dynamics of tourism spatial interaction between Beijing and Tianjin; b) the changes in spatial structure of both international and domestic tourist flows between the city pair. In addition, we also examine how each city responded to the impacts of HSR in its tourism development and marketing policies, as evidenced by the impact of high-speed rail on tourism spatial structure.",

In general, tourism demand is negatively related to distance, i.e. the longer the distance, the smaller the demand. This is the so-called \u201cdistance-decay effect\u201d (Bull, 1991). Geographic distance is invariable, but travel time can be reduced with the introduction of new transportation technology thus stimulating tourism demand. In addition, reduced travel time enables tourists to spend more time enjoying tourism activities at a destination. Travel time thus replaces distance as a determinant of tourist demand in the gravity model, widely used to investigate interaction between spaces (Gu and Pang, 2008; Prideaux, 2000). The result is time-space compression known as the \u201ctime compression effect\u201d of HSR (Wang et al., 2018). The \u201ctime compression effect\u201d also provides destinations connected to the HSR network with the opportunity to grow the level of tourist arrivals to that destination (Zhou and Li, 2018).",

Chen and Haynes (2015) found significant positive effects of HSR on accessibility as well as economic convergence in several regions of China. Similarly, Liu and Zhang (2018) further confirmed that HSR the increased accessibility and reported a reduction of access disparity within regions but not between regions. Examining the potential HSR in the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion in the US, Yu and Fan (2018) estimate how HSR will improve the megaregional accessibility but they also predicted an increase of inequality in accessibility. In the UK, Fr\u00f6idh (2005) suggested that while the building of HSR will disrupt the country's geography, it may not provide significant overall accessibility benefits. Vickerman (2015) for example found that cross-border inter-regional HSR services such as Europe's Trans-European Transport Network initiative has failed to reduce regional disparities in accessibility or to integrate regions across national borders in many regions.",

A study by Gimpel (1993) found that France's TGV network has played an important role in changing the socio-economic and spatial patterns in the regions it services. Plassard (1991) observed that a centralizing effect occurred in France where Paris has become the center of the star-shaped TGV network. Masson and Petiot (2009) noted that after the introduction of HSR between Paris and Marseille in 2001 there was an increase in short stay travel to Marseille and as well as a change in travel by specific market sectors such as seniors and international travelers. However, the introduction of HSR does not automatically lead to increased tourist flows. The construction of a HSR line from Perpignan in southern France to Spain generated increased flows of French visitors to Spain but not of French visitors to Perpignan (Masson and Petiot, 2009), because French tourists were more attracted to Spanish cities such as Barcelona than Perpignan.",

Gravity models are often used to explain bilateral tourism movements between two geographic areas (Morley et al., 2014). Empirical support focusing on international tourism can be found in tourism flow analysis (Keum, 2010; Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008) although some inherent defects in the model are still present (Olsson, 1967). Wilson's model (Wilson, 1967, Wilson, 1970) with exponential deterrence function becomes a possible alternative. Li et al.

This pattern suggests that international tourists have a higher propensity to undertake a one-day trip to Tianjin when visiting Beijing. Domestic tourists also began concentrating back to Beijing after the opening of the HSR service and diffused to Tianjin as additional HSR services were introduced. The results indicate that the spatial structure of international tourist in relation to travel to Tianjin remain the same with or without HSR services.",

This is a new finding that has not been previously reported. In contrast, the spatial structure of international tourist has continued to move towards Tianjin with or without HSR, which is consistent with the findings by Chen and Haynes (2015) and Pagliara et al.

It is also apparent that in the post 2008 period there was a change in the intensity of competition which in turn influenced the location of tourism firms. This change highlights how the intensity of competition between connected destinations may increase because of the agglomeration effect as described by Masson and Petiot (2009) and Yan et al.
