During the time of this letter preparation, three works have just been published to explore the receptor usage of 2019-nCoV. A work by Zheng-Li Shi et al. has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 from human, Rhinolophus sinicus bat, civet, swine but not mouse mediate 2019-nCoV infection in vitro , while the detailed mechanisms are not yet determined. 4 The other two works have reported or predicted human ACE2 usage of 2019-nCoV in a similar way to SARS-CoV mainly based on the coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins. 5 , 6 Considering the fact that the S proteins mutate and gain capability to recognize host receptors among species, 7 , 8 there is still a lack of analyses on receptor usage of 2019-nCoV from the receptor perspective, which does not evolve as quickly as viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 350, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 508, "end": 509, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 673, "end": 678, "text": "5 , 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 790, "end": 795, "text": "7 , 8", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Here, we firstly performed amino acid sequence alignment of ACE2 from different species, including human, five non-human primates (gibbon, green monkey, macaque, orangutan and chimpanzee), two companion animals (cat and dog), six domestic animals (bovine, sheep, goat, swine, horse and chicken), three wild animals (ferret, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat) and two rodents (mouse and rat). The alignment by Clustal W 2.1 shows that they share a high sequence similarity except chicken (data not shown). The result suggests that 2019-nCoV of probable bat origin may not interact with chicken ACE2 and subsequently infect them, which were not considered in the following analyses. In ACE2, the regions at position 30-41, 82-84 and 353-357 are demonstrated to be involved in the interaction with SARS-CoV S protein, where the residues at positions 31, 35, 38, 82 and 353 are critical. 9 Therefore, we took a close comparison in these regions and residues. As shown in Fig. 1 , human and non-human primates share the identity sequences in the regions and residues, implying that ACE2 from non-human primates may recognize 2019-nCoV and medi-ate its infection. As a result, non-human primates may be susceptible to 2019-nCoV and serve as animal models for antiviral research or intermediate hosts for cross-species transmission. In Fig.  1 , the residues of most companion, domestic and wild animals are conserved, especially for the critical ones stated above, while certain ones are variable. For example, Lys31, Glu35, Asp/Glu38 and Lys353 are conserved, which probably form salt bridges. Interestingly, the changes at positions 31, 38 and 82 are observed. These changes suggest steric hindrance and electrostatic interference for host-virus interaction. Taking civet ACE2 as an example, the change of Lys31 to Thr31 is likely to form a hydrogen bond instead of a salt bridge. In addition, the polar side chain of Thr82 may influence the hydrophobic interaction of the original Met82. All these changes may result in a lower binding affinity. However, an additional region covering residues 90-93 has been shown to be involved in civet ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV and enhance their interaction. 10 Consequently, we can't preclude the existence of other regions to compensate for the residue changes. With most residues in human ACE2, the ones from these compaion, domestic and wild animals may be favorable for 2019-nCoV recognition, which is in consistent with the recent work by Zheng-Li Shi et al.

Importantly, the change into His353 in both mouse and rat ACE2 does not form a strong salt bridge as Lys353 does. Since the structural information for mouse and rat ACE2 is unavailable, we carried out homology modeling using human ACE2 (PDB code 2AJF) as template on online ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org ) for further analyses. In Fig. 2 A, the change into Ser82 in mouse ACE2 may interfere with the hydrophobic interaction of the original Met82.

In the 2015-2016 EI outbreaks in Pakistan, Khana et al. reported that the isolated EIV strain (A/equine/Pakistan/16) was reassorted from AIV. 9 The common characteristic for the reported cross-species transmission events of AIV to equines in China, Pakistan, and Egypt is that they occur in farming equines. 8 , 9 In the mixed farming system, equines and domestic poultry often live in close proximity. Compared with racehorses, farming equines have more opportunities to contact domestic poultry and experience long-term environmental exposure to poultry. AIV infections in poultry increase exposure risks to equines. Recently, frequent reports of cross-species transmission events of AIV to farming dogs in China and Korea also indicate the potential threat of AIV to farming animals with close contact with poultry. 10 Another problem is that the farming equines in China, Pakistan, and Egypt had no vaccination history.

At the same time, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guideline has been recently updated recommendations to monitor HBV DNA levels only in patients HBsAg-positive, but they emphasize that there is not enough data to monitoring DNA among patients HBcAbpositive or HBcAb-positive and HBsAb-positive. They remark that a reactivation should be considered if an unexplained increase in liver enzyme is present. In HIV patients, they provide the same recommendations. 11 In a recent review of the literature, the authors also recommend to perform an HBV DNA only in patients with altered ALT. 9 A meta-analysis recommended not to perform an HBV DNA test in this case due to low rate of incidence and the associated cost which needs to be considered especially in an endemic HBV areas. 7 Few data exist in HIV patients. The fact that many triple-infected patients are receiving antiretroviral therapy including (ART) nucleoside/nucleotide analogous, as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both active against HBV, suggest that HBV reactivation rate could be underestimated. In a recently published review, Chang et al., recommend to perform an HBV DNA test at baseline in triple-infected patients. If positive, an HBV-active antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started and HBV DNA needs to be monitored every 4 weeks during treatment and until week 12 after completion of treatment. However, if baseline HBV DNA is negative they match with AASLD/IDSA and EASL recommendations. 12 One of our patients has a basal serology with HBcAb-IgGpositive, both HBsAg-and HBsAb-negatives, and undetectable HBV DNA levels, prior to treatment with DAAs. Regarding HIV infection, he has an analogues-free regimen. One month after having finished treatment with DAAs, the patient consulted because of abdominal pain, nausea and jaundice. He had a total bilirubin level of 11 mg/dl, AST 1025 IU/l, ALT 642 IU/l and INR 1.30. A HBV viral load of 6,193,455 IU/mL was detected; HBsAg, HBcAb-IgM and HBeAg were positive.

In recent years, It has been reported that mismatches of A(H3N2) virus between the influenza vaccine strains and circulating strains were identified frequently, 8 and vaccine effectiveness of A(H3N2) virus declined within 4-6 months postvaccination. 9 In conclusion, we identified the heterogeneity of seasonality pattern of pre-2009 A(H1N1) or A(H3N2) virus in three epidemiological regions of China, and different environment predictors for influenza subtypes and lineages in the southernmost provinces.

CHIKV belongs to the genus Alphavirus within the Togaviridae family and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes-Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus . 2 Since the first report of CHIKV infection in humans in Tanzania, intermittent outbreaks have been documented in Africa, South America, Southern and Southeastern Asia, and the Indian Ocean Islands; thus, its outbreak has become a global public health problem. 3 To date, three evolutionary distinct CHIKV genotypes, namely West African (WA), East/Central/South African (ECSA), and Asian have been identified, based on phylogenetic analyses. 4 A novel lineage of CHIKV-the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL)-has also been reported, which descended from the ECSA genotype during an outbreak on the island of La Reunion between 2005 and 2006. 5 Recently, it has been reported that IOL of CHIKV has spread to Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. 6 In China, the first case of imported CHIKV infection was found in Yunnan in 1987. Subsequently, several sporadic cases of nonindigenous CHIKV infection have been described. In 2010, the first outbreak of CHIKV fever with 129 cases was documented in Guangdong. 7 Recently, another outbreak of Chikungunya fever was Table 1 Epidemiological information on ten febrile returning travelers infected with CHIKV in this study. In this study, nine complete genome sequences isolated from serum samples were successfully amplified and sequenced with 12 overlapping fragments, and then the sequence obtained was deposited in GenBank under accession no. MN402883-MN402892. Compared with the nucleotide sequences of the available from the NCBI database, the nine strains shared the highest 99.61-99.74% nucleotide identity with the East/Central/South African lineage strain Thail 2019 reported previously in Thailand, 2019. Further, Bayesian maximum-clade-credibility tree for full-length nucleotide sequences were constructed using the BEAST package v.1.7.3. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ten CHIKV strains clustered into the homogeneous Indian Ocean clade of the ECSA genotype ( Fig. 1 (B) ).Notably, the ten CHIKV strains isolated from serum samples possessed the mutation K211E in the E1 gene and V264A in the E2 gene; these mutations are associated with significant increase in viral infectivity in Ae. aegypti . 9 The strains also possessed G60D and I211T substitutions in the E2 gene; these mutations contribute to increased CHIKV fitness in Ae. albopictus. 9 However, the A226V mutation in the E1 gene that is related to significant increase in viral infectivity in Ae. albopictus was not observed in any of the strains. 10 In summary, we characterized ten cases of human infection caused by imported ECSA genotype CHIKV in Yunnan, China and successfully isolated nine infectious CHIKVs from the CHIKVpositive serum samples. The mutations associated with significant increase in viral infectivity for Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus were also observed in these strains. Geographically, the Yunnan province is in southeastern China and shares its border with Southeast Asian countries (Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar) that are most affected by CHIKV. With the increase of tourism and trade with Southeast Asian countries, cases of imported CHIKV infection are constantly increasing and may have the potential for re-emergence and autochthonous transmission to Yunnan. The present study highlights the urgent need for continuous molecular screening and epidemic surveillance for CHIKV and its vectors to prevent future outbreaks of CHIKV infection among the human population of Yunnan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 169, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 458, "end": 459, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 719, "end": 720, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 900, "end": 901, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1092, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1203, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1465, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2620, "end": 2621, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2767, "end": 2768, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2933, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1518, "end": 1525, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2393, "text": "Fig. 1 (B)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Dear Editor,"}, {"text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) ( U1702282 ), the Reserve Talents Project for Young and Middle-Aged Academic and Technical Leaders of Yunnan Province (2019HB012), and Youth Talent Program of Yunnan \"Ten-thousand Talents Program\" (YNWR-QNBJ-2018-054).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Financial support"}, {"text": "The authors declare no competing financial interests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Declaration of Competing Interest"}]}
