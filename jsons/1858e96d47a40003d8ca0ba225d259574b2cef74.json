In these days, many colleagues of whatever specialty are regularly employed by their hospitals to face COVID-19 emergency in Italy, Europe and worldwide. We are not plastic surgeons anymore. Many of us feel lost, unprepared and inadequate for such an emergency. Here in Bergamo, the center of the Italian epidemic, we felt small and incompetent at the beginning (1). However, we must remember that first of all we are doctors, then plastic surgeons. In these weeks we are putting our willingness at the service of our patients and colleagues.",

At the same time, the reaction of our hospital, Papa Giovanni XXIII, has been impressive too: over 400 doctors and over 900 nurses entirely dedicated to COVID-19 positive patients; 88 intensive (one of the largest Intensive Care Unit in Europe) and over 400 non-intensive care beds are set aside for those patients. This huge wave of COVID-19 positive patients, forced the hospital management to progressively and rapidly recruit, train and put on ward over 400 physicians of any discipline and 900 nurses from March 6th.",

Every single day we phone and update the relatives of those who, because of the worsening of their respiratory condition, are unable to speak and call home. We are sometimes those who communicate the death of his or her beloved but also those who bring words of hope, words of love: \"Please doctor, could you tell him that I love him so much?\". Some of these patients die without the hug of their families. A plastic surgeon is not usually used to face death because in our surgery it is not so frequent. We would say that the death of a lonely patient also takes a part of us away. It acquires a different hint, touching some inner cord, it makes you feel impotent and lost. As plastic surgeons we often take care of the psychological side of patients and, except for some tumours and traumas, the pathologies we treat -like breast reconstruction-are not fatal diseases.",

Thanks to our support, a clinical physician is able to evaluate a larger number of patients, focusing on the most critical ones. This is why we keep going on. We want to make our part, working with commitment, dedication and professionalism and assisting all our patients to the best of our in-continue-updating knowledge. We are proud to help Bergamo community to face COVID-19 emergency and trying to make the difference in our wounded city. We hope this letter will help other colleagues not to consider themselves unprepared or unready. The contribute of everyone is crucial to defeat this ongoing pandemic which has not only upset our clinical routine, but it has woken us up from our everyday life. Before COVID-19 everything was scheduled, now there are no plans and we are not sure about our priorities. Only if we behave, as long as necessary, with the awareness of being able to make a difference, we will win this terrible fight against SARS-CoV-2. Only together we will go back to hugging, kissing and loving each other.",
