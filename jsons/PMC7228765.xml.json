NPC1L1 mediates the uptake of dietary cholesterol at the surface of the intestinal epithelium (Altmann et al., 2004; Weinglass et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2011); the drug, ezetimibe (Zetia) blocks NPC1L1 and is an alternative to statins for patients with elevated plasma cholesterol (Rosenblum et al., 1998; van Heek et al., 2000; Davis et al., 2001). The related NPC1 protein functions in lysosomes to transport LDL-derived cholesterol to the cytoplasm (Pfeffer, 2019). Plasma LDL is delivered to the lysosome by endocytosis, and its cholesterol esters are cleaved by acid lipase to release free cholesterol for cellular use (Brown and Goldstein, 1986; Goldstein et al., 1975). NPC2 protein binds this released cholesterol via its iso-octyl group (Xu et al., 2007) and transfers it to the N-terminal domain of NPC1 (Kwon et al., 2009). Mutations in either NPC2 or NPC1 protein can give rise to a severe neurodegenerative disorder called Niemann Pick Type C disease, which leads to massive accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes of all tissues, and premature death (Pentchev, 2004).",

Moreover, the co-crystal structure of NPC2 bound to NPC1\u2019s second lumenal domain (Li et al., 2016b; see also Winkler et al., 2019) provides a valuable starting point for thinking about how cholesterol is likely to be transferred onto NPC1 protein.

This cavity lies at the boundary between the inner leaflet of the lysosome membrane and the lumen, an advantageous position as the cavity would be available to both receive cholesterol from NPC1\u2019s N-terminal domain and to transfer it to the adjacent membrane. Consistent with this model, Trinh et al. (2018) recently found that NPC1\u2019s N-terminal domain appears to be able to transfer cholesterol (albeit inefficiently) to an adjacent NPC1 molecule for membrane transfer.",

This height corresponds well with the dimensions of the glycocalyx that is thought to line the limiting membrane of the lysosome (Wilke et al., 2012). Given the existence of the glycocalyx, it is hard to imagine how NPC1\u2019s N-terminal domain could gain access to the lipid bilayer to deliver cholesterol to the membrane. In considering the established mechanisms of transporters for amino acids, sugars, and hydrophobic small molecules, we noted that these extremely diverse proteins undergo significant conformational changes to enable an open extracellular pocket to bind ligand and then close, thereby opening a release site on the opposite side of the protein (and membrane). This type of \u2018rocker arm\u2019 model would require movement of protein domains in relation to one another, for transport functionality. We therefore set out to test whether NPC1 functions by conformational transformations rather than via a sterol hand-off pathway restricted to the N-terminal domain. We present here data consistent with a model in which cholesterol passes directly through NPC1 and NPC1L1 proteins and can be blocked by plugging the channel at the top with a small molecule inhibitor such as ezetimibe for NPC1L1 (this study) or itraconazole for NPC1 (Long et al., 2020).",

The cholesterol-interacting peptides are located at the interface of the MLD and CTD as well as within the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane domain TM7 to TM8. This 14-residue loop composed of residues 800\u2013813 (broken line in Figure 3A) was not ordered in the high-resolution crystal structure of N-terminal domain-deleted NPC1 (PDBID: 5u74), and thus is likely mobile. We tested whether this loop is required for NPC1 function by deleting five residues (807-811) in mouse NPC1. The proper folding of this mutant was assessed by monitoring its intracellular localization in NPC1-/- HeLa cells (Figure 3B); co-localization with endogenous LAMP1 confirmed that this mutant NPC1 is correctly delivered to lysosomes.",

These residues could contribute mobility for adjacent residues or specific interaction sequences needed for cholesterol export. It is worth noting that this TM7/TM8 loop lies adjacent to a binding site for cross-linkable cholesterol (Hulce et al., 2013). We replaced residues 807\u2013811 with alanines, maintaining the length of the loop sequence. Co-localization with endogenous LAMP1 protein confirmed the proper subcellular localization of the mouse NPC1-807-811Ala mutant (Figure 3B) and similar to wild type NPC1, the 807-811Ala mutant protein fully rescued cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes of NPC1-/- transfected cells, monitored by immunofluorescence light microscopy (Figure 3C) and quantitative flow cytometry (Figure 3D). These data show that the cytoplasmic loop connecting TM7 and TM8 is indispensable for NPC1-mediated cholesterol export, and length is more important than specific amino acid sequences. These data imply that mobility of the protein helices is necessary for transport, with cytoplasmically oriented residues contributing in important ways. It is possible that this small truncation (\u0394807\u2013811) may strain the orientation of alpha helices in this region of the protein, but note that these five amino acids were among 14 residues that were not ordered in the high resolution crystal structure (PDBID: 5u74), and the truncation was designed with the goal of maintaining this structure. Nevertheless, the data do not rule out the possibility that this deletion simply favors a conformation of the protein that does not facilitate cholesterol transport.",

As an additional control, we also monitored the activity of an NPC1 protein in which only one cysteine mutation was introduced: NPC1-/- HeLa cells transfected with A521C-mouse NPC1 were fully rescued for cholesterol accumulation, monitored by light microscopy and flow cytometry (Figure 4C,D).

Conformational dynamics of wild type and the above-mentioned NPC1 protein constructs were analyzed by measuring the RMSD (root mean square deviation in \u00c5) of protein backbone atoms, as sampled during the MD trajectories (Figure 5). NPC1 dynamics were characterized by a high degree of flexibility of the linker region (residues 247\u2013266) connecting the N-terminal domain and helix 1 of the transmembrane domain, as well as a high degree of disordered secondary structure in the loops facing the cytoplasm (see Figure 1A). Notably, during our simulations, the N-terminal domain maintained its interface with the MLD and CTD and did not exhibit any large-scale hinging motion toward the transmembrane domains. The NPC1 mutant in which the MLD and CTD are locked together (A521C/K1013C) showed a similar range of motion for protein backbone atoms to that of wild type NPC1 (Figure 5). On the other hand, mutants in which the N-terminal domain was locked to the CTD (P251C/L929C) showed smaller RMS deviations relative to wild type. Locking the relatively disordered linker region of the N-terminal domain to the CTD removed a large source of protein flexibility. Similarly, the large RMSD values measured with mutant \u0394807\u2013811 stem primarily from increased disorder in the loops on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Figure 5).",

Lack of transport was not a result of differences in cell surface localization or protein levels, as we determined the localizations and amounts of all the mutant proteins using a cell surface biotinylation assay in conjunction with immunoblotting (Figure 6C and Johnson and Pfeffer, 2016).

Specifically, mutants that can lock the MLD to the CTD at the interface of these domains interfere with cholesterol transport; residues that comprise a loop at the cytoplasmic face of the transmembrane domains are needed to provide inter-domain mobility and/or an unconstrained conformation, and can be replaced with polyalanine for full function. Moreover, we have shown that ezetimibe inhibition of NPC1L1 relies on its interaction with multiple domains and depends on sequences that are predicted to contribute to domain interface interactions in the protein structure. A highly plausible model for ezetimibe inhibition would be that it functions in a manner analogous to the disulfide bond mutants: locking the domains to one another and thereby blocking cholesterol transport. By binding at the interface, ezetimibe could also plug a channel between these domains. We showed for the first time that purified NPC1L1 MLD binds bile salt micelles. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that ezetimibe blocks bile salt interaction in full-length NPC1L1, the mutagenesis experiments support the importance of interface residues for drug binding, which will have the additional consequence of blocking inter-domain dynamics.",

Determination of the structure of NPC1 revealed that the N-terminal domain cholesterol binding site is located on the opposite side of the protein to the sterol-sensing domain; this finding led to the proposal that the N-terminal domain may transfer its cholesterol to an adjacent NPC1 molecule (Li et al., 2016a). The experiments presented here do not address this possibility directly, but they demonstrate that cholesterol transport does not require full release of the N-terminal domain from the rest of the protein. Locking the polyproline linker that attaches the N-terminal domain to the rest of NPC1 protein had no impact on the ability of NPC1 to export cholesterol from lysosomes using kinetically sensitive and quantitative assays for this process. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain need not hinge away from the rest of the protein to transfer cholesterol from the N-terminal domain to other parts of the protein and/or across the membrane. Note that the portion of the linker most proximal to the NTD will nevertheless retain some flexibility, despite the presence of the additional disulfide bond (Figure 1B).",

PTCH has 12 transmembrane domains instead of 13; it also lacks the cholesterol binding N-terminal domain of NPC1 and NPC1L1. Transmembrane domains 2\u20136 comprise a sterol-sensing domain analogous to transmembrane domains 3\u20137 of NPC1. Yan and colleagues detected two sterol molecules in the PTCH structure: one in a cavity located between the two extracellular domains and the second, adjacent to the sterol-sensing domain (Gong et al., 2018). Their mutant analysis suggests that cholesterol binding causes significant conformational changes, with an untwisting of the interactions between the extracellular domains and reorientation of certain TMs. Qi et al. (2018b) found two sterol-like ligand densities in the transmembrane domain of each PTCH molecule, one in the sterol-sensing domain and the other near transmembrane domain 12. Importantly, the structural analysis is consistent with a tunnel in the PTCH protein, through which a sterol could pass.",

Important hints came initially from Cravatt and colleagues (Hulce et al., 2013), whose proteome-wide analysis of cholesterol binding proteins revealed novel cholesterol binding locations in NPC1 (Figure 3A). Our mutant protein functional analysis is consistent with the possibility that NPC1 and NPC1L1 undergo significant conformational transitions to accomplish transport of cholesterol across the membrane.",

This finding meshes well with our proposal for how ezetimibe blocks cholesterol transport by NPC1L1 at a similar location in the corresponding structure. Whether cholesterol exits this channel at the sterol-sensing domain (see also Winkler et al., 2019) or proceeds through the molecule to the other side of the bilayer is not yet clear, but our finding that constriction of the proteins' cytoplasmic domains blocks function suggests that the channel may indeed pass all the way through the transmembrane domain. Structural analysis of such mutant proteins may help to resolve this question.",

Hydrogen atoms were added using H-build from CHARMM and the N- and C-termini were capped with neutral groups CH3--CO-- and methyl acetate --NH--CO--OCH3, respectively.

Free thiols in purified NPC1 were labeled with 13C2D2-iodoacetamide (\u2018heavy\u2019). Then the disulfides were reduced and the resulting reactive cysteines were labeled with iodoacetamide lacking isotope labels (\u2018light\u2019) followed by proteolysis and LC-MS analysis. Control samples were labeled with the same reagent before and after reduction (\u2018light/reduce/light\u2019 and \u2018heavy/reduce/heavy\u2019) to identify isotope distributions in the limiting cases.
