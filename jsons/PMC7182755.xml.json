Despite increases in total intensive care unit beds over the past decade, occupancy rates in the United States are approximately 66-68%7 at any given time; some facilities reporting as high as 82.1%7. Currently, mechanical ventilation is used in approximately 33% of intensive care unit admissions7 and is projected to increase 2.3%/year8. The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is also expected to increase, especially for older adults and patients with comorbidities9. There also appear to be surges in mechanical ventilation usage due to seasonal influenza10. Previous research indicates that United States could accommodate a surge of 26,200 to 56,300 cases requiring mechanical ventilation with extensive pre-pandemic preparation11. With the surge in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerabilities to the continuity of our healthcare system is apparent. Importantly, availability of these resources varies between states and geographical areas and, as such, some areas may be more heavily impacted than others.12\n",

There are certain patient demographics that appear to be associated with a higher susceptibility to developing severe respiratory complications from COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation2, 3, 4, 5\n,\n14. These conditions included obesity, older age and smoking as well as cardiometabolic and lung disease2, 3, 4, 5. Patients with these characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions are also at higher risk for serious complications from seasonal influenza13\n,\n15\n,\n16. Of note, obesity was present in nearly one third of hospitalizations and fatal cases during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic13. However, not all patients sharing these characteristics experience similar outcomes during this pandemic or even became infected. There are also people who do not possess these characteristic who require mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admissions due to the COVID-19 pandemic17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. As such, there are other, underappreciated factors contributing to the risk for poor outcomes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic observed in admitted patients beyond the aforementioned risk factors.",

The average maximal inspiratory pressure generated by a healthy adult aged 18-29 years is 128cmH2O (116.3-139.5cmH2O) for males and 97cmH2O (88.6-105.4cmH2O) for females. By comparison, the average maximal inspiratory pressure for a healthy adult aged 70-83 years is 76.2cmH2O (66.1-86.4cmH2O) for males and 65.3cmH2O (57.8-72.7cmH2O) for females24. In healthy adults, the pressure needed for both full breaths and quiet breathing represents a small fraction of the respiratory muscles maximal pressure generating capacity24 (Table 1). The disparity between the pressure demands of breathing and peak pressure generating capacity of the respiratory musculature allows spontaneous breathing to occur with high efficiency (i.e., low energy costs and a large reserve).",

Lower diaphragm thickness even at the outset of mechanical ventilation is associated with delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation and a higher risk of complications46.

However, respiratory muscle weakness is associated with dyspnea28, and there are certain populations where respiratory muscle weakness is more likely17\n,\n48\n,\n49. Even in healthy older individuals, the maximal inspiratory pressure produced by the respiratory musculature decreases24. However, due to the normal age-related changes in lung compliance and muscle strength the threshold for respiratory muscle weakness with aging is also lower (i.e., >80 years: 42cmH2O)25. It is important to acknowledge that these age-related reductions are in reference to healthy individuals. As described earlier, in patients with multimorbidity, the risk of respiratory muscle weakness may increase or potentially compound these age related reductions in respiratory muscle performance35\n,\n38. While routinely screened measures of lung volume and flow rate are associated with respiratory muscle performance36\n,\n37, changes in respiratory muscle performance may occur independently of these values and may be detected prior to changes in lung volume36\n,\n37\n,\n49\n,\n50.",

The TIRE requires the patient to breathe in through the manometer from residual volume to total lung capacity and to sustain that breath for as long as possible53. Due to the nature of this test the TIRE provides maximal inspiratory pressure and several other measurements of respiratory muscle performance. Inspiratory duration, which is measured in seconds, represents the duration of maximal sustained inhalation (i.e., endurance)53. Sustained Maximal Inspiratory Pressure is expressed in Pressure Time Units or Joules and represents single breath work capacity53. Both the Sustained Maximal Inspiratory Pressure and the slope of its curve are emerging clinical measures across several populations54\n,\n55. The combination of these values provide a more comprehensive assessment which may identify characteristics of respiratory muscle weakness or fatiguability that may be missed when only measuring maximal inspiratory pressure55. An example of this is demonstrated in Figure 1\n; an individual with a higher maximal inspiratory pressure may conversely demonstrate a much lower capacity for producing work over time. At this time, there is only a single study that has proposed normative values for TIRE56. In addition, reliability and validity for the TIRE has only been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease54. Additional research is needed to further assess the validity and reliability of the TIRE, as well as further establish normative values for comparison in patient populations.",

Patients exhibiting the most profound baseline respiratory muscle weakness tend to receive the greatest benefit from respiratory muscle training. Those in poor health and at risk for viral infection (e.g., influenza) may demonstrate respiratory muscle weakness and thus be at increased risk of a poorer clinical trajectory if acute respiratory distress syndrome ensues. However, even in healthy individuals without dyspnea, respiratory muscle training has also been shown to provide modest benefits on exercise performance62. Conventional respiratory muscle training protocols require breathing through a device with valve set to a pressure threshold. Once enough pressure is generated, the valve opens and air flows through the device. A percentage of the maximal inspiratory pressure is used as the training load based on the type of protocol. Training protocols typically use resistive loads ranging between 30-80% of maximal inspiratory pressure. One of the unique advantages of respiratory muscle training is that it can be implemented in shorter intervals (30 breaths, 2 times/day). Training effects from respiratory muscle training have been observed for multiple protocols lasting only 4 weeks60\n,\n63\n,\n64. For patients with dyspnea and/or sedentary, these training characteristics may promote adherence and compliance to training65\n,\n66.",

Pre-operative respiratory muscle training has been shown to reduce the risk of post-operative respiratory complications67, 68, 69, 70. Mans et al demonstrated that preoperative respiratory muscle training may reduce the risk of post-operative pulmonary complications following cardiothoracic or abdominal surgery by half70. A recent study by Chen et al found that a 5-day intensive pre-operative respiratory muscle training protocol resulted in significant reductions in both pulmonary complications and length of hospitalization71. Four weeks of respiratory muscle training at 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure has been shown to reduce hospital length of stay, mortality and the risk of intubation in patients at risk for prolonged hospitalization72. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, respiratory muscle training improves weaning outcomes73 and reduce hospital length of stay74. Evidence regarding the beneficial effects of respiratory muscle training is strong and the connection between impaired respiratory muscle performance, mechanical ventilation and respiratory complications is also apparent. While the role of respiratory muscle training to mitigate the respiratory complications of viral infection in susceptible patients has yet to be investigated, currently available evidence supports further exploration of respiratory muscle training to reduce the risk of severe complications during a viral infection.",

Even with 12 weeks of respiratory muscle training, the effects gradually decline after 1 year if patients do not performance maintenance respiratory muscle training78 or participate in vigorous aerobic exercise79\n,\n80. However, since the effects of respiratory muscle training have been shown to occur even within 5 days of training71, at the first outbreak of a viral pandemic, at-risk patients could be advised to initiate an urgent prophylactic respiratory muscle training protocol. Initiating respiratory muscle training following intensive care unit admission requiring mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome could also help accelerate recovery and discharge home.",

As described in this concept paper, it appears diminished respiratory muscle performance, in conjunction with other disconcerting characteristics (e.g., obesity, chronic diseases), may contribute to the overwhelming burden imposed on healthcare systems due to viral pandemics. What is more concerning is that frequency of viral pandemics, and the prevalence of the global population at poor health associated with impaired respiratory muscle performance are potentially both at the tipping point. In nations with high economic development, poor baseline health is now, unfortunately, the norm; obesity alone is present in now 42.4% of the adult population in the United States and continues to increase81. Another troubling trend is the presence of multimorbidity in older adults82, a population that also continues to increase83.",
