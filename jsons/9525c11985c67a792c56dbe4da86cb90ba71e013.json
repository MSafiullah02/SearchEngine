Among several notions of causality, Granger causality [7] is a popular method for causal inference in time series due to its computational simplicity.

That is, given two time series x and y, considering the previous observations of y together with x improves the predictability of x if y causes x.

Unlike other information-theoretic approaches (e.g. entropy-based algorithms [16] ), we incorporate complexity of the models in the MDL-principle. Thus, it leads to a natural trade-off among model complexity and goodness-of-fit while avoiding over-fitting. Although Granger causality is well-studied, most of the algorithms are designed for homogeneous data sets where time series from a specific distribution are provided. Recently, Budhathoki et al. proposed a MDL-based algorithm designed for causal inference on binary time series [6] . Additive Noise Models (ANMs) have been proposed for either continuous [13] or discrete [12] time series. Graphical Granger approaches, which are popular due to their efficiency, mostly consider additive causal relations with a certain Gaussian assumption, e.g. TCML [1] or [2] . Despite the efficiency of homogeneous algorithms, many applications generate heterogeneous data, i.e. a mixture of various time series from different distributions. Moreover, transforming a time series to another time series with a specific distribution leads to inaccuracy. Therefore, applying an algorithm designed for homogeneous data sets on heterogeneous data does not guarantee a high performance.",

            "text": "Granger causality states that a cause (y) efficiently improves the predictability of its effect (x). There are various approaches to infer the causality depending on how to measure the predictability. Typically, any improvement in the predictability is measured in terms of variance of the error by a hypothesis testing approach [10, 14] . Moreover, graphical Granger methods are designed based on a penalized estimation of vector autoregressive (VAR) models [1, 18] . The intention in this approach is that, if y causes x it has non-zero coefficients in the VAR model corresponding to x. First, Arnold et al. [1] proposed a Lasso penalized estimation for VAR models (TCML). As an extension, Bahadori and Liu [3] proposed a semi-parametric algorithm for non-Gaussian time series. Recently, authors in [5] employed adaptive Lasso to generalize this approach to the heterogeneous cases (HGGM). As another category, probabilistic approaches interpret the predictability as the improvement in the likelihood. Among them, Kim and Brown [8] introduced a probabilistic framework (SFGC) for Granger causal inference on mixed data sets by a pairwise testing of the maximum likelihood ratio. The approach is FDR-based where the statistical power of this methods rapidly decreases with increasing the number of hypotheses. As another approach, informationtheoretic methods detect the causal direction by introducing a causal indicator. Among them, transfer entropy, shortly TEN, is designed based on Shannon's entropy [16] to infer linear and non-linear causal relations. In this approach, it is more likely that the causal direction with the lower entropy corresponds to the true causal relation. However, due to pairwise testing and its dependency on the lag variable, the computational complexity of TEN is exponential in the lag parameter. On the other hand, compression-based algorithms apply the Kolmogorov complexity and define a causal indicator based on the MDL-principle. Unlike the entropy-based approach, we incorporate the complexity of the models in the MDL-principle leading to more efficiency. Recently, Budhathoki et al. [6] proposed a MDL-based algorithm (CUTE) to infer the Granger causality among event sequences in a pairwise testing manner. This algorithm is designed only for binary time series. To the best of our knowledge, ITGH is the only algorithm in this approach which deals with discrete and continuous time series and supports the heterogeneity of data sets.",

Then, we use this information as an assumption in our greedy algorithm. To be fair, we also input the fitted distributions to other comparison methods. Moreover, for every x i , we sort x 1 , ..., x p based on their dependencies in the corresponding regression model. In fact (also inspired by [1] ), the time series with the higher dependency w.r.t. x i has the higher coefficients in the regression model. Thus, we iteratively include the time series with the higher dependency w.r.t. x i in the regression model as far as this procedure improves the compression cost of x i . Essentially, for a candidate x j we compute the description length of x i (see Definition 2) considering two models M Ci and M Ci\u222axj . If including x j pays off in terms of the compression cost, we keep including the next time series. Otherwise, the procedure terminates when no further causes exist for x i . The output of this algorithm is an adjacency matrix for the Granger causal network. ITGH is deterministic in the sense that investigating the causal relations for p time series in any random order leads to the same causal graph. The runtime complexity of ITGH in the best case is O(p 2 log(p)) + O(pc 2 n) and in the worst case is O(p 2 log(p)) + O(p 2 c 2 n) where c is d \u00d7 |C i \u222a x j |.

            "text": "What causes the climate changes? In this experiment, we investigate causal relations between the climate observations and various natural and artificial forcing factors when no ground truth is provided. The data set, provided in [9] , is publicly available. We consider the monthly measurements of 11 factors over 13 years (from 1990 to 2002) in two states in the US, i.e. Montana and Louisiana: temperature (TMP), precipitation (PRE), vapor (VAP), cloud cover (CLD), wet days (WET), frost days (FRS), green house gases including Methane (CH4), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) and solar radiation including global extraterrestrial (GLO). After fitting the distribution for any time series, we apply ITGH and other heterogeneous methods inputting the most appropriate distribution. The data providers suggested a maximum lag of 4 [9] . However, no exact information about the lag is given. Therefore, the lag is randomly set to 3 for Louisiana and 2 for Montana. Since the temperature is the most concerning factor in global warming and also for a better visualization, we focus on the factors which influence the temperature. Green house gases, specially CO2, as well as solar radiation are the most important factors in global warming. Moreover, depending on where a state is located, cold or warm region, various climate measurements influence the temperature. According to the annual average temperature of states in the US, Louisiana is located in the warm region where the CO2 concentration is also high. As Fig. 4a shows, ITGH correctly detects CO2 and the solar radiation as causal factors for temperature (confirmed by [9] ). Moreover, influencing the temperature by VAP is also plausible since Louisiana is located in the warm subtropical region. On the other side, the result of SFGC does not sound interpretable since it finds a causal relation among all the factors and the temperature, even the frost days per month. HGGM seems more efficient compared to SFGC, However, it does not find any effects caused by one of the most effective factors, i.e. CO2. Unlike Louisiana, Montana is located in the cold region. Therefore, the detected causal direction from the frost days and vapor to the temperature in Fig. 4b is reasonable (also confirmed by [9] ). However, HGGM is not able to find the relation among the frost days and the temperature. Moreover, the CO2 concentration in this state is not high. Therefore, CO2 does not influence the temperature in Montana dramatically. ITGH correctly does not consider a causal relation among CO2 and temperature while SFGC does. On the other side, HGGM is not able to find the effect of frost days, although it correctly recognizes the relation between CO2 and the temperature. ",

Following the MDL-principle, we introduced an integrative objective function applicable for time series having distributions from the exponential family. Our greedy approach leads to an effective and efficient algorithm without any assumption about the distribution of the data. One of the avenues for future work is to employ our MDL-based approach to efficiently detect the anomalies in heterogeneous data sets.",

Multivariate MDL-based Granger Causality: Let C i denote the set of all causal time series corresponding to x i together with x i itself where |C i | \u2264 p for i = 1, ..., n.

Moreover, assuming the prediction model M Ci w.r.t. x i , the parameters in this model are the regression coefficients or \u03b2 i (a vector of length p \u00d7 d) plus g i , the appropriate link function. Following a central result from the theory of MDL [15], the parameter costs to model n observations of x i w.r.t. the prediction model M Ci is approximated by DL(M Ci ) = mi 2 log n where m i denote the number of parameters in M Ci , i.e. m i = p \u00d7 d + 1. The model cost depends logarithmically on the length of time series x i . The intention behind this formulation is that for shorter time series the parameters do not need to be coded with very high precision. However, we consider time series with the same length in this paper. Altogether, for a data set D consisting of time series x 1 , ..., x p our MDLbased objective function is defined as DL(D, M ) = p i=1 DL(x i |M Ci )+DL(M Ci ) where M = {M Ci |i = 1, ..., p}.",
