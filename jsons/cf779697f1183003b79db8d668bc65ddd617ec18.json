States have also enacted, on varying timelines, shelter-in-place (SIP) or equivalent orders to further limit COVID-19 spread.

We then compared the magnitude of this change (i.e., difference-in-differences) between years. Linear regression limited to 2020 was then used to investigate effects of SIP orders, and number of incident COVID-19 cases and deaths on cirrhosis hospitalizations, adjusted for linear time trends in pre-and during-COVID periods. SIP was computed as the proportion of hospitalizations in a given week in a state with an active SIP order. To investigate changes in patient and hospital-level characteristics during the pandemic, we defined three 2020 subgroup eras: pre-COVID (before February 29 th ), early-COVID (February 29 th to March 25 th ), and late-COVID (March 26 th to April 15 th ). March 26 th was chosen because the VHA announced a COVID-19 Response Plan on March 23 rd which was widely implemented within three days. 7 Across these periods, we compared summary statistics using Chisquared or Kruskal-Wallis testing as indicated.",

We also identified important changes in hospitalizationlevel characteristics in the late-COVID era, including significant declines in academic center hospitalizations, decreased LOS, fewer hospital transfers, increased admission MELD, and more frequent discharge to home rather than facilities. These changes likely reflect initiatives to preserve inpatient resources, and guidance encouraging patients to remain home. It is also likely that patients, perhaps due to personal concerns about COVID, are avoiding hospital presentation until symptoms are severe. Importantly, our findings with cirrhosis likely parallel changes in other inpatient resource-intensive conditions such as congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and myocardial infarction. 8 These findings have significant health systems implications. There has been a clear drop-off in hospitalizations for patients who ordinarily would meet acute care criteria. It is unclear how these patients are being managed as outpatients, and given the baseline vulnerability of patients with cirrhosis, it is likely that many do not currently have adequate healthcare access. Likewise, abbreviated inpatient care may adversely impact outcomes such as short-term mortality, and changes in post-hospital disposition away from facilities may increase hospital readmissions and outpatient acuity. Finally, these data may inform anticipatory changes in resource allocation during future pandemics based on expected shifts in utilization.",
