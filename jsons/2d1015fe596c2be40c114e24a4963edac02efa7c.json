(1) It is the contemporary stage in the evolution of laboratory-based epidemiology that may have begun with the discovery in the late 1800s of ways to differentiate bacterial organisms by pure culture in artificial media. (2) Molecular epidemiology uses new molecular biology tools to address questions difficult or not possible to address by old laboratory tools. Just as statistical tools have become indispensable in epidemiological investigations and interpretations of epidemiologic data, molecular biology tools today have come to elucidate epidemiologic features of diseases that cannot be easily characterized by conventional techniques. Applied to infectious diseases, molecular biology methods have also come to challenge our traditional notions about the epidemiology of these diseases and have engendered novel opportunities for their prevention and control. This chapter will (1) review definitions commonly used in molecular epidemiology, (2) present an overview of molecular biology methods used to study infectious disease epidemiology, and (3) describe examples of the types of epidemiologic problems that can be addressed by molecular biology techniques, highlighting new concepts that emerged in the process of applying this approach to study bacterial infectious diseases.",

Correspondingly, molecular epidemiology can be defined as \"the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states, conditions, or events in specified populations that utilizes molecular biology methods\". In molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases, the word \"determinants\" is emphasized. Furthermore, as we learn more about the biology of agents of infectious diseases, it is becoming evident that disease distribution in a community of hosts may be determined not only by factors such as the distribution of contaminated vehicles, host risk characteristics, and environmental contexts in which these diseases occur, but also by a pathogen's genetic composition.",

            "text": "For example, communicable bacterial pathogens that cause diarrhea are almost always transmitted by the fecaloral route. Colonization of the intestine is an important prerequisite for these pathogens to facilitate their transmission to new hosts. Similarly, the agent of tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is transmitted by the airborne route, must cause active disease in the host's lungs to assure its transmission to new hosts. An agent of leptospirosis, Leptospira, prolongs its survival in a community of hosts by establishing carriage in a mammalian host's kidney tubules so that it can be excreted in urine to infect other hosts. Mechanisms that underlie these organisms' ability to infect a specific target organ, which determines the specific pattern of transmission, are genetically determined. Thus, the definition of molecular epidemiology can be expanded to include the following: a study of the genetic factors that determine and regulate an organism's specific mode of transmission among hosts within an environmental context.",

            "text": "Differentiating molecular epidemiology from taxonomy and phylogeny: In February 2009, a bibliographic search by PubMed using the words \"molecular epidemiology\" generated 27,822 publications that contained these words in the title or the abstract. Most of these publications dealt with A.S. Evans, P.S. Brachman (eds.), Bacterial Infections of Humans, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-09843-2 3, C Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009 the laboratory methods used to subtype microorganisms. They did not discuss the use of these techniques to characterize disease occurrence, distribution, or determinants of disease distribution. Thus, the term \"molecular epidemiology\" is often used to describe studies that should be more appropriately called \"molecular taxonomy\" or \"phylogeny\". Taxonomy is the science of classification of organisms into naturally related groups based on a factor common to each. Phylogeny is the study of lines of descent or evolutionary development of an organism. (1) Molecular epidemiology, taxonomy, and phylogeny may employ the same molecular biology laboratory techniques, but each is based on distinct principles. In taxonomy or phylogeny applied to infectious agents, the data that are generated are used to describe properties of organisms and their relationships to each other, based on an inferred model. Molecular epidemiology seeks to identify relationships between the etiologic agent of a disease (organism causing the disease), the host, and the environment in which the etiologic agent and the host reside. Both epidemiology and phylogeny as applied to infectious diseases may describe the distribution of particular genetic attributes of a pathogen over time. However, in phylogeny, the relationships of these genetic attributes over time must be guessed, since past evolutionary events cannot be empirically confirmed. That is, phylogenetic analysis seeks to infer past evolutionary events based on a model from a set of observations made with materials available in the present. Epidemiology focuses on events of the present or the recent past. It uses analytical and empirical study designs to identify factors that predict the relationship of attributes of pathogens to disease distribution in place, person, and time. It attempts to identify factors that determine disease transmission, manifestation, and progression. In molecular epidemiology, the hypotheses that are generated are testable or can be made to be testable empirically when enough study subjects are identified. Finally, epidemiology is always motivated by an opportunity or possibility for intervention and prevention. Thus, an application of a molecular biology technique to type an organism per se does not by itself constitute molecular epidemiology. However, it should be stressed that the disciplines of taxonomy and phylogeny play an important role in the discipline of molecular epidemiology, and this idea is reviewed in detail in a separate reference. (1) Terminologies introduced in this chapter are based on definitions recommended by the European Study Group on Epidemiological Markers (3) and the Molecular Typing Working Group of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. (4) Others were adapted from a reference book Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases: Principles and Practice. (1) The terminologies below are mostly used in ways to apply to prokaryotic organisms.",

For some reason, when molecular biology methods are used in an epidemiologic study, the study is described as \"molecular epidemiology\".

For example, the species Escherichia coli characterized biochemically can be further subtyped into a \"serogroup\", based on the organism's characteristic somatic antigen (O-polysaccharide). A numerical designation is assigned to an E. coli strain carrying a characteristic O-polysaccharide that induces an antibody response (e.g., O157). The same strain, if further subtyped based on its flagellar protein (H-antigen), is classified as a \"serotype\". It will then be given an O:H designation (e.g., O157:H7). The genus Salmonella is biochemically separated into species and subspecies. They are further subtyped serologically according to their O and H antigens. Unlike E. coli serotypes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (subspecies I) serotypes are given a descriptive name rather than a numerical designation, e.g., S. enterica serotype (or serovar) Typhimurium or S. enterica serotype Enteritidis. Nearly 1,500 serotypes of S. enterica subspecies I are currently recognized.

As opposed to hundreds of ways to phenotype bacteria, all genotyping tests can be grouped into a variant of just three basic analytical procedures-(a) hybridization, (b) gel electrophoresis, and (c) nucleic acid sequencing. This allows for the use of common equipment and standard reagents to analyze many different types of infectious agents. Furthermore, genotypic characterizations of pathogens facilitate standard information storage and data analyses, interpretation, and communication, which are all amenable to computer-assisted manipulations.",

These typing methods, of course, had to be developed in place of direct whole genome DNA sequence analysis, which, despite recent advances in the sequencing technology, remains cumbersome and expensive for bacterial organisms (although no longer the case with viruses). Further detailed reviews on this topic are mentioned at the end of this chapter (Suggested Reading).",

Plasmids are covalently closed circular DNA that carry genes that may encode characteristics such as antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, or other functions that provide selective advantage to the organism but are not essential for its growth or survival. In fungi or protozoas, extrachromosomal elements used for typing may include mitochondria (8) and kinetoplasts (schizodeme analysis). (9) Plasmid-based typing is an example of an electrophoresis-based strain typing procedure. It compares differences in molecular weight (MW) and the number of different plasmids a bacterium may carry. Nucleic acids and proteins are negatively charged. Plasmids, thus, can be resolved electrophoretically in an agarose gel matrix according to MW. That is, the separation of these molecules depends on their drag through the gel matrix as they migrate toward the positive charge pole. Large MW plasmids migrate more slowly in the gel matrix than low MW plasmids. Thus, depending on the number of different MW plasmids, each strain represented by a single electrophoretic lane will generate a banding pattern, a \"fingerprint\", or a profile, that can then be compared across multiple lanes ( Figure 1) .",

DNA fragments separated in an agarose gel are first transferred onto a piece of nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. The membrane is then exposed to a piece of single-stranded DNA (probe) labeled with a molecule that facilitates visual detection of a selected target DNA fragment. The probe will specifically bind (hybridize) to its complementary DNA sequence embedded in the membrane. For example, a nucleic acid sequence or probe ATCGGCGATG will hybridize to a target containing the sequence TAGC-CGCTAC. Thus, this probe-based detection of target DNA fragments is called hybridization. If the organism of interest harbors more than one copy of the target DNA sequence in different locations in the chromosome, the membrane will show multiple bands (banding pattern) in a single lane, which can be visually detected. Of course, the number of such visualizable bands will be few and will not be obscured by the other fragments in the membrane, which cannot be visualized because they do not hybridize to the probe. This allows for comparison and interpretation of the band patterns ( Figure 2B ). This method has been applied to subtype a wide variety of bacterial organisms, and is the current standard method used to type M. tuberculosis, in which the organism's repetitive DNA element or insertion element called IS6110 is used as the target for a hybridization probe (called IS6110 RFLP). (14) One limitation of this approach is that the DNA sequence selected as a target for a hybridization probe must be present in the chromosome in high copy numbers (usually >5) for the technique to be sufficiently discriminating. Clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis completely lacking or having small copy numbers of IS6110 have been found. (14) In such situations, secondary typing methods must be applied. Another drawback of the RFLP analysis followed by hybridization is that it requires a specialized reference or research laboratory to perform.",

However, electrophoresis in agarose gels of large pieces of DNA introduces two additional technical constraints. Linear pieces of DNA \u226525,000 bases (25 kilobases or kb) are difficult to resolve by the conventional agarose gel electrophoresis method. They get stuck during migration across the gel matrix. Thus, PFGE was developed in which the orientation of the electrical field across the gel is changed (pulsed) periodically.

            "text": "3.2.6. Whole-Genome Sequence Comparison. The reduced cost and ability to rapidly sequence large pieces of DNA engendered a new discipline called comparative genomics. (21, 22) With viruses, whose genomes are considerably smaller than those of bacteria, comparative genomics is already applied to directly genotype clinical isolates. That is, hundreds of genomes of viral strains belonging to one species can now be compared rapidly to each other and applied to address epidemiologic questions. For example, it was the comparative genomics analyses that enabled investigators to conclude that the agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) belonged to a group of coronaviruses. (23) With bacteria, because of the large genome, such comparisons are still not possible for a large number of strains. That is, hundreds of genomes of a single bacterial species cannot be compared because they have not been sequenced. However, new information obtained from comparison of a limited number of whole genome sequence databases is used to develop alternative genotyping methods. For example, at least eight different clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus have now undergone whole genome sequence analysis. Multiple alignment comparisons reveal several regions of difference. One such region called RD13 containing a cluster of Staphylococcus exotoxin (set) genes has been recently exploited to develop a new genotyping method called exotoxin sequence typing. (24) Whole genome sequence comparison of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, CDC1551, strain 210, and Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97 led to the identification of 212 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. (25) More recently, an analysis of these SNP markers in a global collection of 294 M. tuberculosis strains identified six phylogenetically distinct SNP cluster groups (SCGs). SCGs were strongly associated with geographic origin of these isolates. (26) 3.2.7. Microarray Comparisons. Another way to compare whole genomes is based on hybridization patterns generated from thousands of short pieces of DNA (probes) of known sequence representing the genome, arranged on a glass slide or nitrocellulose membrane, often referred to as microarray or \"gene chip\". Microarrays are a type of DNA hybridization matrix typing method described previously. The hybridization technology is not new, and the microarray technology is just a recent variant of the technology made possible by miniaturization techniques developed in the semiconductor industry. (27) (28) (29) Most microarray-based applications to infectious disease currently focus on taxonomic differentiation or diagnosis, and not on epidemiologic investigations. In one study, a whole genome DNA microarray analysis of 13 vaccine strains of M. bovis-BCG found 16 regions deleted in BCG strains relative to the sequenced M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome. (30) Kato-Maeda et al. found 25 deleted regions among 19 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates by a whole genome microarray approach. (31) Here, they reported that there was an inverse relationship between the proportion of deleted regions in these strains and the percentage of patients with cavitary disease infected with these strains. The discovery that M. tuberculosis contained such regions of deletion led some investigators to propose a genotyping scheme called \"deligotyping\". (32) In this method, clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis are compared according to differences in the regions of deletions.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests can overcome these limitations. The PCR technology is a powerful and simple molecular biology tool, which is now applied in a variety of ways to genotype microorganisms in taxonomic as well as epidemiologic studies. It should be noted that PCR is only one of several methods called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) used to make multiple copies of a target DNA or RNA of an organism or cells in vitro without culturing the organism or cells. PCR is perhaps the most frequently used NAAT and the most common method applied to subtype microorganisms.

These steps are carried out in a plastic microcentrifuge tube containing a reaction mixture of buffers, nucleotides, primers, heat-stable polymerase, and a sample DNA template. DNA when heated to a sufficiently high temperature will separate into single strands. Separation into single strands of a doublestranded DNA is called denaturation. Thus, in the first step, the sample DNA (template) is usually heated to 95-100 \u2022 C. Primers are synthetic single strands of DNA (oligonucleotides) of variable lengths designed to bind (anneal) to specific complementary target sites in a DNA template. They can be custom-made commercially. Primers bind to the target sequences when the temperature of the reaction mixture is decreased from a denaturation temperature to an annealing temperature range (\u223c40-60 \u2022 C). At about 70-75 \u2022 C (primer extension temperature), a thermostable enzyme called DNA polymerase will add nucleotides (extension) complementary to the unpaired DNA strand onto the annealed primer. In this way, a DNA segment located between the two annealed primers will be copied. This three-step cycle involves change in temperature only-denaturation, annealing, and extension temperature-which is facilitated automatically by a programmable heating device called thermocycler. Depending on the time applied to each of the steps in the cycle, the type of thermocycler used, and quality of the polymerase, a single copy of DNA can be multiplied to more than a billion copies after 30 cycles in less than 3 h. The amplified product can then be visualized in an electrophoretic gel under UV illumination after staining with ethidium bromide.",

For bacteria, if a clinical specimen is obtained from a normally sterile body site such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or deep tissue, and it is obtained in a sterile fashion, PCR assay may be performed directly on the specimen itself. The primer sequences could be designed to bind to sequences that are specific to a target organism (e.g., IS6110 of M. tuberculosis). In this way, DNA targets in an organism infecting nonsterile sites (sputum, urine, stool) could be amplified. Blood, urine, and other tissues may contain products inhibitory to PCR, but if the specimen contains a sufficiently large number of the infectious agent of interest, the desired target DNA could be amplified and detected. If a stored organism becomes contaminated with other organisms, or lose their viability, a PCR test can still amplify DNA from that organism, as long as the DNA material is intact. If the primers are highly species specific, a PCR test can distinguish the target sequences from DNA derived from contaminating organisms, thus precluding culturing the target organism from a specimen.",

Arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), also called randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), are PCR techniques that rely on arbitrarily or randomly designed sequences of primers that anneal specifically to DNA templates in a target organism. (38) (39) (40) If a set of these randomly designed primers anneal to target DNA sequences, the intervening segments that are proximal enough to these annealing sites can be amplified and generate products of different MW. Such products will display a band pattern in an electrophoresis gel for each strain. The advantage of this method is that the target nucleotide sequence does not have to be known. The primer sequences are determined empirically until a set that works is found. The final choice of the primer design is based on the generation of reproducible and interpretable band patterns. The major drawback of this test, however, is its reproducibility. Because this technique is based on random sequences of the primers, there is always a risk that contaminating DNA may get amplified. To minimize these nonspecific amplification, the following precautions are taken: (1) DNA templates should be from organisms recovered in pure culture, (2) include a sample in which no template is added (negative control), (3) standardize template DNA concentration in all samples to be tested, and (4) if possible, test all the desired samples in one batch.",

All of these procedures use the same approach, in which primers are designed to anneal to target repetitive sequences in the outward direction (outward primers) near the ends of these repetitive elements. The newly synthesized DNA strand extends away into the nonrepetitive sequences. Thus, sequences located between the elements are amplified. Because these elements are interspersed in the chromosome at different locations between species or strains, the amplified products will be of variable number and MW. The size of the amplified products will depend on the distance between the repetitive elements and the quality of the polymerase, and other PCR conditions used. Of course, longer the distance between the repetitive elements, harder it is to amplify such a region.

IS6110 has been used as a target as well as a probe for RFLP-Southern blot fingerprint analysis of M. tuberculosis strains. Ross and Dwyer reported a PCR-based method designed to amplify sequences between IS6110 elements to generate DNA fingerprint patterns. (49) Of course, for IS6110-PCR-based typing method to work, the IS element has to be present in large numbers in M. tuberculosis. Thus, methods that take advantage of other different interspersed short repetitive DNA elements present in M. tuberculosis have been developed. There are at least four such short repetitive elements used to perform PCRbased genotyping of M. tuberculosis-(1) the polymorphic GC-rich tandem repeat sequence (PGRS), (2) the major polymorphic tandem repeat (MPTR) loci, (3) the exact tandem repeat (ETR) loci, and (4) the direct repeat (DR) elements located at a single locus in M. tuberculosis complex strains (Table 1) .",

When the DRE-PCR method was compared to the standardized IS6110 RFLP analysis of M. tuberculosis strains during a TB outbreak in a prison in Havana, Cuba, the two methods identified the same clusters of TB patients who were clearly linked epidemiologically in the prison, which validated the PCR-based test for epidemiologic application.

(52) (53) (54) In M. tuberculosis,the MPTR contains 15-bp repeats with a single consensus sequence and high sequence variability between these repeats. (55, 56) Each ETR locus contains large tandem repeats with identical repeat DNA sequences and each locus has a unique repeat sequence. (53) Thus, the number of these repeat units at each MPTR or ETR locus can be predicted from the size of the PCR products, which becomes the basis for VNTR genotyping. VNTR genotyping has been applied to a variety of bacterial organisms. (57) (58) (59) A recent variant of this method applied to type M. tuberculosis is called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) VNTR, which is based on microsatellite-like sequences scattered throughout the M. tuberculosis chromosome. (60, 61) By using 12 of these MIRU loci, several investigators have demonstrated that the resolution achieved by this typing method is comparable to that of IS6110-RFLP typing method. (62) (63) (64) Another PCR-based method used to type M. tuberculosis is based on a region called direct repeat (DR) locus. This locus contains multiple copies of a repeat 36 bp sequence interspersed with unique spacer sequences which are 34-41 bp long. (55, 65) A typing method based on this variation in the spacer sequences is called spoligotyping (spacer oligotyping). (66) Oligonucleotides representing the spacers are synthetically made and covalently attached to a piece of membrane. This membrane then is used as a target for hybridization against PCR products obtained from amplification of the spacer sequences located between the DRs. PCR products used as probes are generated from the total genome of a strain of M. tuberculosis by one set of primers designed to amplify spaces between the DRs in the test strain. If the membrane contains an oligonucleotide representing a spacer sequence also present in the test strain, an amplified product will hybridize to it. This will generate a hybridization matrix, not unlike the microarray discussed earlier. Thus, unlike the previously described PCR-based typing methods, the patterns that are generated and compared are not electrophoretic fingerprints.",

One relatively new method called multilocus sequence typing (MLST) combines PCR assay with sequencing to assign a sequence type designation to a strain. Standardized MLST analysis for most bacterial organisms is based on sequencing a PCR-amplified region from each of a set of unlinked housekeeping genes. For example, with S. aureus, these genes include seven genes: arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi, and yqiL. (68, 69) Each of the amplified segments from these genes shows potential allelic variation in different S. aureus isolates. An MLST clone that is designated as a particular sequence type (ST) is defined as a strain belonging to a set of isolates with identical sequences at each of the seven loci. A methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain designated ST8 (also called PFGE type USA300) has recently been reported to cause widespread community outbreaks of severe skin and deep tissue infections in different regions of the United States. (70, 71) Because this is a sequence-based method, it is highly reproducible across different laboratories, and thus standardized protocols have been developed for several bacterial organisms.

What are the risk factors for infection and transmission in a community and how is the infection maintained in a community of hosts? How and why does a particular strain suddenly emerge to become the predominant strain in a community, and why does it disappear? How is drug-resistant infectious disease prevalence in a community affected by fluctuations in clonal distribution over time in that community? How is the prevalence of spectrum of clinical manifestations (mortality, severe disease, asymptomatic infection) of an infectious disease affected by clonal distribution of a pathogen in a community? Do unique biologic characteristics of a member of a bacterial species contribute to enhanced transmission and hence increased prevalence of that member in a community or institution? How do we use the knowledge we gain about the dynamics of disease transmission to implement effective disease control programs? How do we measure the effect and impact of the intervention made based on the knowledge acquired from the use of a particular laboratory test? Once these questions are asked, one can then decide how to collect the isolates, which collection of isolates should be genotyped, what comparison isolates (controls) should be collected, and which of the many strain typing techniques should be used.",

This is because in an outbreak, an analytical study (case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort) can be designed to implicate a source or reservoir of an infectious agent responsible for the outbreak. If a risk factor or a vehicle of an outbreak is identified, the number of cases in that outbreak attributable to that risk factor (attributable risk fraction) can be calculated. In an outbreak, this would be 100% minus the background disease prevalence for that place. Unfortunately, in places like the United States, it is estimated from surveillance reports that less than 20% of reported cases of foodborne diseases, such as salmonellosis, come from recognized outbreaks. (72) The others are reported from sporadic cases. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to identify risk or estimate attributable risk fraction for sporadic diseases. The ability to genotype bacterial isolates from sporadic disease cases provides an opportunity to identify risks and calculate attributable fractions for those risks.

Typhimurium versus other serotypes of Salmonella found recent hospitalization to be a risk factor for S. Typhimurium infection. In the study, children who came to the study clinics with diarrhea developed diarrhea at home. Children with history of recent hospitalization were previously hospitalized for illnesses such as pneumonia and acute respiratory infections that required antimicrobial drug treatment. Because it was known at that time that recent exposure to penicillins or antimicrobial agents was a risk factor for acquisition of multidrug-resistant salmonellosis, (77) the investigators were faced with the question of whether the children with S.

This is one of the major discoveries about infectious disease epidemiology made in the last 25 years by the application of molecular biology tools.

This knowledge, while helpful, does not provide a focused intervention option, and often, as we all know, such knowledge does not contribute to long-lasting effective interventions. In the example of salmonellosis in Brazil, however, further stratification of the Salmonella isolates by plasmid profile analysis identified a more specific risk factor related to the isolates themselves. The knowledge that many cases of multidrugresistant salmonellosis were occurring in specific hospitals in the city brought attention to the need to identify factors within the hospitals that contribute to Salmonella transmission. Today, nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant salmonellosis in S\u00e3o Paulo is rare.

For example, with UTI, a study can be performed to see if there is any association between a predominant clonal group of uropathogenic E. coli identified by a strain typing method and a risk factor. If so, this would provide evidence that there was indeed an outbreak. Here, the ultimate confirmation of the hypothesis will be made by showing that the removal of that risk factor leads to amelioration of the recognized problem.",

The distinction among colonization, contamination, and infection becomes blurred and is a frequent topic of discussion among hospital staff.

Thus, in hospital epidemiology, another important question is, \"do antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms predominate in hospital settings because they are selected by the use of antimicrobial agents, or do they predominate because of distinct biologic characteristics possessed by a limited number of clonal groups that happen to be drug resistant?\" Molecular epidemiologic methods are beginning to address these questions.",

One of the most intriguing observations made recently about drug-resistant bacterial hospital infections, however, is that, despite strong antimicrobial drug selection pressures, most of these infections are actually caused by a limited set of bacterial strains. Most studies found that drug-resistant strains that are isolated from hospital invasive disease sources are comprised of a limited number of strains. In New York, a 2-year survey of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) infections at a teaching hospital found 54 different PFGE subtypes among 182 isolates. One-third of these were accounted for by just two PFGE subtypes. (89) In Tennessee, a similar survey in different hospitals over a 3-year period showed that among 34 different PFGE types, one was responsible for 61% of 106 VRE isolates obtained from seven different hospitals. (90) In Tennessee, the investigators found that the introduction of the predominant PFGE types at different institutions was caused by new patients transferred to these institutions. Thus, these studies suggest that a clonal strain carried by a transfer patient, once introduced into a hospital setting, can rapidly become predominant in that hospital, and that such a mode of transmission is more important than the selective pressures of antimicrobial drugs in establishing a large number of drug-resistant nosocomial infections. Without the genotype data, such a conclusion would be difficult to make. This type of observation also helps to streamline nosocomial infection control practices. In this case, the recommendation based on the observation is to screen transfer patients for VRE before they are sent to a particular ward in the recipient hospital.",

Communities with a high prevalence of persons with HIV infection or AIDS facilitate greater likelihood of transmission of tuberculosis, just because of the greater prevalence of cases of tuberculosis. Thus, host genetic factors that have a similar effect on infection could contribute to enhanced transmission of a disease. Studies that examine host genetic factors that affect disease transmission are just beginning.

It was hypothesized that since injection drug users, who are normally a high-risk group for tuberculosis, regularly inject themselves with a variety of antigens that stimulate their macrophages to express RNI and hydrogen peroxide, such a practice will eventually select for RNI and hydrogen peroxide-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis to emerge in that risk group. If such a strain infects a non-user, it will cause a rapidly progressive disease because such a host does not carry macrophages making RNI and hydrogen peroxide, which would otherwise control the initial infection with M. tuberculosis. That is, infection/disease ratio increases when one is infected with such a strain. Thus, more people will develop rapidly progressive disease in a community where such a strain is circulating. This would explain the predominance of C strain in New York City.

Enteritidis, which when tested further for a distinct phenotype led to the identification of a gene associated with that phenotype. These types of studies should yield new understanding of how infectious disease transmission occurs and should provide novel approaches to disease control and prevention. These are just beginning to be applied in this new phase of molecular epidemiology research.",

Molecular epidemiology has begun to challenge old notions and reveal new paradigms concerning the epidemiology of infectious diseases. This chapter introduced new concepts that emerged within this discipline and a sample of its applications. The literature is vast and molecular epidemiologic methods are now a major component of most laboratorybased infectious disease epidemiologic studies. However, it is a constantly evolving discipline and should continue to provide new insights into elucidating epidemiology of infectious diseases in the future.",

Panel (A) shows M. tuberculosis DNA digested with a restriction endonuclease PvuII. Note the smear pattern in each lane, representing thousands of DNA fragments resolved by electrophoresis in an agarose gel. However, when the DNA fragments of the gel are transferred onto a piece of nylon membrane and hybridized with a probe directed at M. tuberculosis's IS6110 insertion element, only the DNA fragments that contain this element becomes visualized (B). Thus, the patterns generated in the membrane in panel B become interpretable and can be compared among strains.",
