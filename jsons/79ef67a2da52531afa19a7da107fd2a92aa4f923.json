The clarifications of the overall antibody repertoire and antigen-specific antibody repertoire are essential to provide important insights into the B-cell response and reshape new vaccines. Here, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to investigate immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) gene segment usage of swine B-cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells following PEDV vaccination. We identified the transcripts of all functional Ig V-genes in antibody repertoire. IgHV1S2, IgKV1-11, and IgLV3-4 were the most prevalent gene segments for heavy, kappa, and lambda chains, respectively, in PBL and MLN. Unlike previous studies, IgKV1, instead of IgKV2, and IgLV3, instead of IgLV8, were the prevalent Ig V-gene families for kappa and lambda light chains, respectively. We further examined the antibody repertoire of PEDV spike-specific B cells by single-cell RT-PCR. In contrast to the overall antibody repertoire, Ig V-gene segments of PEDV spike-specific B cells preferentially adopted IgHV1-4 and IgHV1-14 for heavy chain, IgKV1-11 for kappa chain, and IgLV3-3 for lambda chain. These results represent a comprehensive analysis to characterize the Ig V-gene segment usage in the overall and PEDV spike-specific antibody repertoire in PBL and MLN. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), next-generation sequencing (NGS), single-cell RT-PCR, antibody repertoire Citation: Li, R., Fu, F., Feng, L., and Liu, P.H.

            "text": "Potent humoral immunity fundamentally depends on the generation of a substantially diverse antibody repertoire. An antibody is composed of two heavy (IgH) and two light chains, where the light chain consists of either a kappa (IgK) or a lambda (IgL) chain. Each chain consists of a variable (V) region and a constant (C) region. The antibody V region is the antigen-binding site and determines the antibody specificity. The antibody V region is encoded using the following separate multigene elements: variable (V), diversity (D), and junctional (J) gene segments for heavy chain variable region (IgHV) or V-J for kappa chain variable region (IgKV) and lambda chain variable region (IgLV). Each gene segment contains multiple allele gene segments and is grouped into a different family based on sequence and structural similarity. Porcine IgHV contains one family of immunoglobin heavy variable gene segment, 4 D gene segment families, and 5 J gene segment families (Eguchi-Ogawa et al., 2010; Sun and Butler, 1996; Sun et al., 1998) . Porcine IgKV contains 5 V\u03ba families and 5 J\u03ba families (Butler et al., 2004; Schwartz et al., 2012a) . Porcine IgLV contains 7 V \u03bb families and 3 J \u03bb families (Schwartz et al., 2012b; Sun et al., 2012) . IgHV and IgLV/IgKV domains each contain four regions of relatively stable sequence, termed framework regions (FRs), and three juxtaposed spans of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), especially CDR3 of the heavy chain (HCDR3), which is the most diverse portion of the antibody molecule and is derived from DNA rearrangement of some V, the entire D, and J gene segments (Wu et al., 2015) . The V-gene segment usage of the pig pre-immune antibody repertoire was previously characterized by traditional cloning and Sanger sequencing. Previous studies by Sanger sequencing have shown that the V-gene segment usage of the porcine pre-immune antibody repertoire is highly selective Sun et al., 1998) . Four IgHV genes account for almost 80% of the antibody repertoire (Sun et al., 1998) . This pattern was also observed in IgKV and IgLV . However, the information about the total antibody repertoire and the antigen-specific antibody repertoire elicited by PEDV remains unclear. Additionally, because of the high diversity of antibodies, it is impractical to comprehensively analyze such a diverse antibody repertoire using traditional Sanger sequencing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely applied to characterize the antibody repertoire in healthy hosts or following vaccination or infection (Sattentau, 2014; Sundling et al., 2014) . The information gained by Ig-seq NGS is proving invaluable for understanding antibody responses in disease and vaccination (Sattentau, 2014) .",

Moreover, we further characterized the Ig V-gene segments in PEDV S-specific B cells from MLN through sorted single B cell PCR. The antigen-experienced antibody repertoire characterized by NGS demonstrated that IgHV1S2, IgHV1-4, and IgHV1-15 were the dominant IgHV genes; the highly selective IgKV1-11 accounted for more than 50% IgKV gene usage, and the IgLV3 and IgLV8 families constituted more than 99.99% IgLV V-gene usage. Some degree of compartmentalization in the Ig V-gene usage between PBL and MLN was observed though overall concordance. Interestingly, PEDV S-specific B cells exhibited a different antibody repertoire from the overall antibody repertoire and selectively expanded IgHV1-14, IgLV3-3. These data of the comprehensive analysis of Ig V-gene usage in the swine overall B cells and IgG-switched PEDV S-specific B cells following PEDV immunization are helpful for a comprehensive understanding of antibody immunity and may potentially serve as potential biomarkers for the efficacy of PEDV vaccines.",

            "text": "To comprehensively characterize the usage of IgHV genes, an Ig V-gene transcript library was prepared by 5\u2032 RACE PCR from cDNA and sequenced separately to reduce PCR amplification bias with NGS. We recovered more than 60,900 IgHV sequences from each sample. All members of 13 functional porcine IgHV genes were detected in both PBL and MLN, and each IgHV gene usage of the antibody repertoire ranged from 0.32% to 24.61%, indicating that all functional IgHV genes are active in the host ( Figure 1A and B). Surprisingly, IgHV1S7 and IgHV1S8, annotated as nonfunctional pseudogenes in the IGMT database, were also transcribed and ranged from 0.75% to 3.1% of IgHV gene transcript. In PBL, the highest frequency of IgHV genes was IgHV1S2 (24.61% for pig #242 and 22.34% for pig #243) followed by IgHV1-4 and IgHV1-15 in both pigs. The usage of IgHV1-6, IgHV1-8, IgHV1-10, IgHV1-11, IgHV1-12, IgHV1-14, IgHV1S5 and IgHV1S8 was more than 2%, respectively ( Figure 1A and B). For MLN, just as PBL, IgHV1S2, IgHV1-4, and IgHV1-15 were the top three dominant IgHV genes in pig #242. The frequency of IgHV1-6 and IgHV1-12 usage increased in MLN compared to PBL, especially in pig #243 MLN, in which IgHV1-6 and IgHV1-12 accounted for 15.78% and 16.55%, respectively, indicating that MLN preferentially adopts certain IgHV genes despite the overall concordance between the two compartments ( Figure 1B) . Meanwhile, we identified the transcripts from 4 IgHD families and 5 IgHJ families in both PBL and MLN, the frequency of each IgHD family and IgHJ family exhibited a highly similar pattern between PBL and MLN ( Figure 1C and D). IgHJ5 accounted for 91.10%\u00b10.73% total IgHJ usage, IgHJ3 constituted ranging from 3.88% to 6.45%, and the proportion of the other 3 IgHJ families were totally about 5% ( Figure 1D ). All of these results show that certain IgH VDJ genes are selectively adopted, though all swine heavy chain functional V genes are actively transcribed. The undermining mechanisms are potentially consequences of the antigen-selection of B cells and clonal expansion of specific B cells.",

We obtained ranging from 479,798 to 685,151 sequences of the kappa V-gene transcripts amplified from PBL or MLN by NGS. All the transcripts of 4 functional IgKV family were detectable: IgKV1, IgKV2, IgKV3, and IgKV5 (Figure 2A and B). Among the 4 detectable functional IgKV families, IgKV1 and IgKV2 accounted for more than 99.98% IgKV gene usage in both PBL and MLN ( Figure 2C ), and the rarely observed IgKV3 (IgKV3-3) and IgKV5 (IgKV5-4) only constituted 0.0011%\u00b10.0002%, and 0.0014%\u00b10.0002% of total IgKV genes usage, respectively (Figure 2A and B). The most prevalent IgKV1 accounted for 58.21%\u00b10.53% in MLN and 73.71%\u00b14.01% in PBL, demonstrating the pre-ferential usage of IgKV1 in PBL ( Figure 2C ). In the IgKV1 family, IgKV1-11 accounted for more than 50% total IgKV genes usage in MLN from both pig #242 and #243. The preferential usage of IgKV1-11 in PBL was even more evident and reached 62.70% for pig #242 and 67.82% for pig #243 (Figure 2A and B). The other IgKV1 genes, including IgKV1-9 and IgKV1-14, but not IgKV1D-11, were also detectable and ranged from 1.16% to 6.08%. All the transcripts of 7 functional IgKV2 family genes were presented in our samples. The IgKV2 family genes primarily consisted of IgKV2-6, IgKV2-8, IgKV2-10, and IgKV2-13. The usage of IgKV genes was highly concordant between PBL and MLN ( Figure 2A and B). All of these results demonstrate that the usage of IgKV gene is highly selective and is overrepresented by IgKV1-11. For IgKJ gene segments, IgKJ2 family dominated in the total IgKJ genes though all the transcripts of 5 IgKJ families were identified. IgKJ2 accounted for more than 97.81%\u00b10.20% of total IgKJ genes usage. IgKJ4 made up 1.29%\u00b10.17%, IgKJ1 and IgKJ5 accounted for only 0.57%\u00b10.15% and 0.30%\u00b10.10% of total IgKJ gene usage respectively ( Figure 2D ). Thus, the usage of porcine IgKV and IgKJ is highly selective.",

HCDR3 length in PBL and MLN in both pigs showed a similar Gaussian distribution, although minor individual variation was observed between pig #242 and pig #243 ( Figure 4A and B).

Unlike the overall IgHV gene contribution, IgHV1-4 was the most dominant IgHV gene (37.93% in pig #242 and 34.12% in pig #243) and was followed by IgHV1-14 and IgHV1S2 ( Figure 5B and E). Remarkably, IgHV1-14 was used with greater frequency in PEDV S-specific B cells than that in the total antibody repertoire ( Figure 6A ), suggesting that PEDV S-specific B cells selectively expand IgHV1-14 B cells. For IgKV, IgKV1-11, IgKV2-10, and IgKV2-13 were detected in a total of 42 IgKV clones from PEDV S-specific IgG + cells of pig #242 ( Figure 5C ). Only IgKV1-11 and IgKV2-13 were detected in a total of 31 IgKV clones of pig #243 ( Figure 5F ). Consistent with the pattern of the overall IgKV repertoire, IgKV1-11 was the most dominant gene ( Figure 6B ). For IgLV, only the predominant IgLV3 (IgLV3-3 and IgLV3-4 gene) and IgLV8 families were detected in PEDV S-specific B cells from the both pigs ( Figure  5D and G). Like the usage of IgLV8 family in the total B cell repertoire, all six IgLV8 family genes were detected in the PEDV S-specific B cells, indicating that our primers cover all IgLV alleles. In contrast to the IgLV contribution of the total B cells in MLN, the IgLV8 family outnumbered the IgLV3 family in PEDV S-specific B cells ( Figure 6C ). Additionally, HCDR3 with 9, 16 and 20 aa of PEDV S-specific antibodies totally accounted for 58.62% in pig #242 and 66.66% in pig #243, whereas HCDR3 of overall antibody repertoire with 9, 16 and 20 aa only made up 16.57% in pig #242 and 19.39% in pig #243, respectively ( Figure 6D ). In short, the PEDV S-specific B cell repertoire elicited by the PEDV vaccine engaged a similar breadth of V-genes of the total B cells, highlighting the extensive genetic diversity in the B cell response to the PEDV vaccine, but displayed a different pattern of Ig V-gene usage.",

            "text": "Characterization of the overall antibody repertoire or antigen-specific antibody repertoire is critical for the comprehensive understanding of antibody responses to infection or vaccines. No studies have comprehensively investigated the overall or antigen-specific antibody repertoire in pigs with NGS, although several studies have characterized the antibody repertoire in the different growth stages of natural or infected pigs with Sanger sequencing. NGS-based repertoire analysis is helpful to comprehensively understand the antibody responses following infection or vaccination. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the porcine Ig Vgene usage in PBL and MLN at high resolution with NGS Ig library generated by 5\u2032-RACE PCR, which offers relatively unbiased view of the antibody repertoire. Furthermore, we dissected the PEDV vaccine-induced antibody repertoire from the total antibody repertoire through sorted single-cell PCR technology combined with NGS. Previous studies have shown that the usage of 21 IgHV genes in the pre-immune repertoire in pigs is highly restricted and that 4 IgHV genes accounted for 80% of IgHV usage (Sun et al., 1998) . IgHV1-4 (denoted IgHVA in Dr. Butler's paper), IgHV1-6 (IgHVB), IgHV1S2 (IgHVB), and IgHV1S5 predominated in DNA and transcripts of IgHV genes in different fetal stages and different tissues (Eguchi-Ogawa et al., 2010; Sun et al., 1998) . Here, all 13 identified functional IgHV genes were detected in samples, high-lighting the sequencing depth of NGS. Consistent with previous studies, porcine IgHV usage is restricted that IgHV1-4 and IgHV1S2 are the two dominant IgHV genes. Unlike previous studies, IgHV1-15 was overrepresented in IgHV usage (up to 20%) in both pigs, regardless of tissue types. Relative to the usage profile of IgHV, the V-gene usage of light chains exhibited greater inconsistency with the preimmune repertoire in the previous studies. Prior studies demonstrate that only IgKV1 and IgKV2 of the total of 5 IgKV gene families in the pig genome are transcribed and that IgKV2-10 and IgKV2-1 comprise 80% of the kappa repertoire . In contrast, we identified all 4 functional IgKV family transcripts though IgKV1 and IgKV2 account for more than 99.9% of the kappa repertoire (Figure 2) , indicating the high resolution of NGS-based Ig analysis. Furthermore, unlike previous studies that IgKV2 outnumbers IgKV1 Schwartz et al., 2012a) , IgKV1 was dominantly expressed in both PBL and MLN in the present study ( Figure 2) . Remarkably, the results demonstrated that the IgKV1-11 gene was overrepresented in kappa repertoire of both PBL and MLN; the IgKV1-11 contribution was even greater in PBL and comprised up to 67.82% of the IgKV gene usage (Figure 2 ).

The results indicate that the highly selective usage of IgKV1-11 does occur and does not result from the bias of sequencing methods.",

One of the potential reasons for this variation is the method used to generate the Ig library and sequence. Compared to previous studies using gene-specific primers, we adopted 5\u2032 RACE PCR in the template preparation of the NGS Ig library, which eliminated primer bias and provided a more accurate view of the total antibody repertoire. The stark gene usage differences caused by the primer bias of PCR in the analysis of antibody repertoire and T cell receptor repertoire have been previously reported (Carlson et al., 2013; He et al., 2014) . We acquired more than 390,000 transcripts of light chains by NGS, which were 1000-10,000 folds sequences of those in previous studies. The high resolution of NGS guaranteed the identification of all active transcripts. Actually, we acquired the transcripts of all the identified functional Ig V-genes in this study. The difference in the ages of the pigs may be another reason for the variable contribution of Ig V-gene usage observed. In previous studies, the anti- Figure 5 The PEDV spike-specific B cell Ig V-gene usage is highly polyclonal. A, Ig variable genes were amplified from FCAS-sorted PEDV S-specific B cells. Anti-PEDV spike-Dylight550 (PE) and anti-swine IgG-AF488 (FITC) were used as the sorting probes. Differential usage of Ig V-gene segments in PEDV S-specific B cells from pig #242 (B-D) and pig #243 (E-G) was displayed. RT-PCR amplified IgHV, IgKV and IgLV families from sorted single PEDV S-specific B cells were analyzed with IMGT/V-Quest. Families are color coded. The size of the colored area corresponded to the frequency of Ig Vgene usage. body repertoire in fetuses or neonatal piglets primarily represents the pre-immune repertoire and diversity of \"natural antibodies\". In present study, the antibody repertoire represented the post-immune repertoire following the stimulation of multiple rounds of PEDV vaccine or even other non-pathogenic microbiota. These substantial inconsistencies may represent the selective expansion of some Vgenes from the pre-immune repertoire following repeated antigen stimulation. The selective expansion by a specific antigen was observed in the analysis of PEDV S-specific B cells. The multiple vaccination may contribute to shape the antibody repertoire.",

These results indicate that high IgHV1-14, IgKV1-11 and IgLV3-3 usage by PEDV S-reactive B cells is selectively driven by PEDV S protein antigen. The multiple vaccinations may contribute to shape the PEDV S-specific Ig V-gene selective usage of antibody repertoire because of the repeated antigen stimulation.

Characterizing the Ig repertoire in the gut like MLN will contribute to a better understanding of how Ig responses are integrated across the periphery and gut compartments. Despite the fact that PBL and MLN exhibited a high similarity in Ig V-gene usage and HCDR3 length, there was some compartmentalization between the periphery and gut, such as the skewed usage of IgKV1 in PBL and IgLV3 in MLN ( Figure 2C and 3C) . We also observed individual variation. Pig #243 showed distinct IgHV usage in PBL and MLN and preferentially used IgHV1-6 and IgHV1-12 in MLN ( Figure 1B ) as compared to pig #242. It is cautioning when we state the distribution difference of Ig usage between PBL and MLN. The bulk B population in MLN and PBL contains various B-cell types, and the number of Ig RNA transcripts per cell varies greatly between different types of B cells, e.g., the expression of Ig encoding transcripts is much higher in plasma cells than that in naive B cells. Thus, the number of sequences identified in Ig repertoires does not reliably reflect cell numbers.",
