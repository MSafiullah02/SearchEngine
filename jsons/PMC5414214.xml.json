All diagnoses were confirmed by the microscopic identification of larvae using the agar plate culture method [11] or histopathological findings. For purposes of this study, severe strongyloidiasis was defined by the presence of any of the following: 1) the identification of S. stercoralis from extra gastrointestinal specimens, 2) sepsis, 3) meningitis, 4) acute respiratory failure, or 5) respiratory tract hemorrhage. Severe cases were assigned to DS when larvae were found in any organ, other than those within the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (organs not involved in the life-cycle of S. stercoralis in humans). Other cases were assigned to HS. Medical records were reviewed to extract any relevant and related clinical features.",

In patients with HS/DS, the number of larvae in the host is continuously multiplying [12, 31].

Ivermectin is currently the gold standard for the treatment of strongyloidiasis, and ivermectin was used for all cases in our study. In fact, a systematic review showed cases treated with albendezole or thiabendazole had an increased percentage of deaths among patients than cases treated with ivermectin [9]. Seggarra-Newnham recommend that treatment for HS/DS is to administer ivermectin daily until symptoms resolve and stool tests have been negative for at least two weeks [7]. The research Group on Chemotherapy of Tropical Disease, Japan, also recommends HS/DS cases complicated with acute respiratory failure commonly use daily ivermectin until the disappearance of larvae in both sputum and stool.
