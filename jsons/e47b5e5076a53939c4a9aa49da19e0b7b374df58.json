The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas and affected 196 countries worldwide by March 25, 2020, which raised intense attention internationally (Chen et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . It is really important to find out all the factors that play a role in COVID-19 spreading in Urban. The transmission of viruses can be affected by many factors, including climate conditions (such as temperature and humidity), population density and medical care quality (Wang et al., 2020) . Therefore, understanding the relationship between the geographical features of a country and the transmission of COVID-19 is key to making the best decision to control and prevent the pandemic. In other words, the discipline of geography is playing in the fight against the virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease . Therefore, urban geography can be very helpful in that the spatial organization of the city determines the spatial pattern of the spread of the disease (Boulos and Geraghty, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .

The disease growth rates in these provinces are(161.63, 41.37, 38.43, 53.67 and 36.28,   respectively), which are significant compared to other cities with low population densities. There are also areas with the highest infection rates with high intra-provincial movement, such as Tehran, Khorasan Razavi, Isfahan, and Fars, with disease growth rates of 161.33, 24.48, 70.074 and 18.42, respectively. According to the results of this article, these provinces should prevent intra-provincial movements as much as possible and prevent the incidence of the disease to reduce the infection rate. Meanwhile, Tehran is in a more critical situation. Based on our results using the influential meteorological variables, the scenario of the impact of weather conditions on the rate COVID-19 outbreak can be put forward. In provinces where the relative humidity is low, the outbreak is higher than elsewhere. Despite, the provinces of Mazandaran and Gilan are wetland (based on the De Martonne technique) with higher infection rates. An example can explain the above result. The population density of Alborz province (from arid regions) is 465 and that of Mazandaran (from wetlands) is 138.22 which is approximately 3.3 times more than that of Mazandaran. While the infection rate is 41.37, in Mazandaran it is 53.68 (more than Alborz). Another influential parameter is the wind speed. In provinces with low wind speeds such as Mazandaran, Golestan, Tehran, and Gilan the outbreak rate is much higher. The wind speed can cause the spreading of suspended particles in the air. The particle density can have a significant role in the outbreak of the virus in cities like Tehran. Therefore, the prevention of particle density increment can be an effective way to reduce the infection rate in cities. The measurements like minimizing the use of vehicles and limitation of work hours of urban factories can be taken. According to the results, in the southeastern provinces of Iran with high solar radiation, the infection rate is lower than elsewhere. For example, Sistan and Baluchestan, Kerman, Hormozgan and Bushehr are among the provinces with high radiation and rate. Other variables such as precipitation and air temperature up to this point in the study were not significantly correlated with the COVID-19 outbreak.

Consequently, these two factors have a remarkable effect on increasing of COVID-19 outbreak.Some indicators such as Humidity and Solar radiation have an inverse relationship with infection rate however the correlations are not significant according to Pearson's method low percent of relative humidity supports the survival of viruses on the contaminated area. However, the humid area causes the coronavirus to be inactive(Chan et al., 2011). Among the meteorological variables, Wind speed has a significant and inverse relationship with the rate of COVID-19 infection rate. Therefore, in the lower speed of the wind, the infection rate is higher.
