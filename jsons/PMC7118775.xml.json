Symptoms vary depending on volume of material ingested and presence of complete or partial blockage. The most common symptoms are sudden onset of anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and lethargy, which is sometimes accompanied by stress-related diarrhea. Palpation often reveals gastric distention, GI pain, or in many cases, presence of the foreign material itself. Laboratory analysis is nonspecific, but may reflect dehydration, stress, and starvation in chronic cases. Plain radiography often reveals characteristic GI gas patterns typical of obstruction in other small animals. In some cases, definitive diagnosis is made at exploratory surgery [2].",

Helicobacter apparently does not cause disease in all ferrets, but is linked to severe lymphocytic plasmacytic inflammatory gastric lesions, diarrhea, anemia, and chronic wasting. Diarrhea can be black and tarry when Helicobacter-associated ulceration is present (\nFig. 2). Helicobacter can be difficult to completely eradicate. As reinfection is common, the organism must be eliminated from all contact animals as well [3], [4]. Gastric biopsies of ferrets that have undergone Helicobacter treatment can reveal healing ulcers, fibrosis, and other evidence of gastric damage that may explain why treatment of Helicobacter does not always result in complete resolution of clinical signs (D. Reavill and R. Schmidt, personal communication, Zoo and Exotic Pathology Service, West Sacramento, CA).",

However, a more recent study showed that lesions typical of proliferative bowel disease could be produced by coinfection of ferrets with an intracellular Desulfovirbio species and coccidia [9]. Typical symptoms include chronic diarrhea with or without blood or mucus, tenesmus, and possible rectal prolapse. Weight loss and dehydration typically follow [2].",
