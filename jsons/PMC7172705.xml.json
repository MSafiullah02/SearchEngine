Therefore, we evaluated whether there was a difference in the gene expression of IFN lambda 1\u20133 subtypes between infants with a clinical diagnosis of RSV associated acute bronchiolitis and those with HRV infection. The same analysis was also performed between RSV or HRV subtypes. In addition, to characterize the activation of type III IFNs in the airway tract of infants with RSV or HRV infections, we evaluated whether there was a coordinate activation between IFNs lambda and that of MxA and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 56, which are well known markers of type I and III IFN antiviral activity.12 Finally, to further characterize the above issues, we also assessed whether a correlation between IFN lambda 1\u20133 levels and demographic, virological and clinical parameters in RSV and HRV infected infants actually exist.",

We found a significant positive correlation between the transcript level of IFN lambda 1 and the clinical score index in infants with RSV infection (r = 0.350, p = 0.025) but not in those HRV infected (Table 3). In particular, IFN lambda 1 seems to be associated to an increase in the respiratory rate during RSV infection. Indeed, as showed in Fig. 2\n, when RSV infected infants were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the respiratory rate (<45 breaths/min, 45\u201360 breaths/min, and >60 breaths/min), there was a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.022). Specifically, infants with >60 respiratory breaths per minute showed higher gene expression of IFN lambda 1 compared with infants with <45 or 45\u201360 respiratory breaths per minute. In contrast, we failed to detect any correlation between the IFN lambda 1\u20133 gene expression levels and age, weight, number of days of hospitalization, and several immunological and biochemical parameters (numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils or platelets, and levels of glycemia, sodium, C-reactive protein and hemoglobin). In addition, no differences were detected in IFN lambda 1\u20133 gene expression for male and female and between infants with fever or without fever (data not shown). In an attempt to determine whether RSV or HRV load influences the gene expression of type III IFN, levels of RSV- or HRV-RNA were analyzed respect to the expression of IFN lambda subtypes. No significant correlations were observed between RSV or HRV load and the levels of IFN lambda 1\u20133(Table 3).",

This is particularly interesting considering that it is known that the RSV NS1 and NS2 proteins can suppress in vitro the induction of IFN lambda.33 However, whether such response reflects host reactions for counteracting the NS1/NS2 viral interference on IFN lambda induction is actually unknown. In our previous studies, we also observed a higher transcript level of ISGs as well as of most pattern recognition receptors in infants with RSV compared to those with HRV infections.26, 34 All these findings may suggest that RSV infection are generally associate to a more robust innate immune response compared to those caused by HRV. In agreement, Garcia et al. reported that concentrations of several cytokines in nasal wash tend to be higher in children with RSV than in those with HRV.35 In contrast, Jartii et al. found that children with HRV-associated wheezing episodes show increased concentrations of Th1 and Th2 cytokines compared with those with RSV.36 However they measured cytokines concentrations in serum rather than respiratory tract secretions during wheezing episodes.",

            "text": "Interestingly, this study also demonstrated that levels of IFN lambda 1 seem to be associated with severity of respiratory disease in RSV but not in HRV infected infants. This observation is not unusual for RSV pathogenesis. In fact, several studies have described severe RSV disease in children who have high levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by innate immunity in respiratory secretions.45, 46 Whether or not IFN lambda contributes to augmentation of inflammation in our RSV positive infants is currently unknown. However, in addition to their antiviral effects, type III IFNs have been shown to play a critical role in regulating the adaptive immune response by acting directly on Th1/2 polarization and cytokine production.47, 48 In particular, IFN lambda 1 has been shown to increase production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, with no concomitant increase in IL-1 or TNF, suggesting it may not directly engender local tissue destruction, but could contribute to the inflammatory process during bronchiolitis.47 A reciprocal control of IFN lambda 1 and Th2-associated cytokines seems also to exist.49 Indeed, it has been shown that there is a reciprocal regulation between IFN lambda1 and IL-4 or IL-13 which are well established Th2 cytokines associated with increased RSV disease severity.49 In addition, although type III IFNs seems to be activated during in vivo RSV infection, we observed that enhancement was not related to viral loads. Indirectly the lack of a direct effect of IFN lambdas on viral replication may reflect a more relevant role of the cross-talk between inflammatory citokines and type III IFN subtypes in determining the bronchiolitis clinical course.",

The presence of this strong inflammatory response is consistent with the observation of the presence of string respiratory rates in RSV positive infants with increased IFN lambda1 levels. On the other hand, the reduced expression of IFN lambda subtypes observed in the airway tract of HRV infected infants compared to those with RSV infection, may not be enough to activate an excessive inflammatory response affecting the clinical course of bronchiolitis. In agreement with this hypothesis, Wang Q et al. found that MDA5 deficient mice with reduced IFN lambda productions show less HRV induced airway inflammation.51 A greater number of eosinophils was also observed in HRV infected infants than in those with RSV accordingly to our previous study.52 In this regards it has been recently demonstrated that eosinophils may contribute to antiviral immunity and play a beneficial role in limiting viral respiratory lung dysfunction.53 However, it is also believed that eosinophilia is one of the atopic features that may contribute to the higher risk to develop recurrent wheezing and asthma.37\n",

Therefore it is conceivable that the presence of reduced airway IFN lambda response in HRV infected infants than in those with RSV infections could reflect the presence of a milder bronchiolititis clinical course caused by HRV compared to that associated to RSV. Indeed, Miller et al. reported that IFN lambda1 levels were higher in wheezing children infected with HRV compared with no-wheezing and increased with worsening symptoms.39 Alternatively, our data could indicate that an impaired IFN lambda production during HRV infection is present, not only in asthmatic subjects,27, 54 but also in infants with bronchiolitis which can be associated with the inability to control early virus replication and to mount an adequate Th1/Th2 immune response which in turn may impact on recurrent wheezing predisposition and an exacerbation pathogenesis.",

This analysis could allow us to deep understand the complex picture of the airway IFN lambda response as well as the intensity and the dynamic nature of the antiviral and inflammatory pathways associated to type III IFN response during pediatric lower respiratory tract infections. Unfortunately the collected material was just enough to perform the experiments shown in the present study and the above issues could not be addressed.
