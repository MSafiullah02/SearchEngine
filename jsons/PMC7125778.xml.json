On the other hand, the major impact on the cost of CAP care is determined by whether or not a patient is admitted to the hospital.3 In the United States, < 20% of all CAP patients are admitted to the hospital, but the dollars spent on these patients account for > 90% of the total cost of care for this disease, emphasizing the impact of the hospital admission decision.3 For a number of years, prognostic scoring systems have been used to define not only the predicted mortality rate of CAP, but also, by inference, the site of care, reserving hospital admission for those with a high predicted mortality rate.",

However, the PSI appeared to be more discriminating in identifying patients with a low risk of mortality, with 68% being defined by PSI to have a low risk (classes I to III), with a mortality rate of 1.4%, while 61% were defined by the CURB-65 to have a low risk (score of 0 to 1) with a mortality rate of 1.7%. However, the CURB-65 may have been more valuable at the severe disease end of the spectrum because it defined high-risk patients as those with a score of 2, 3, 4, or 5, each with a progressively increasing risk of death, while the PSI was less discriminating, defining only two groups as being severely ill. In another analysis,6 the CURB-65 score also appeared to identify, most accurately, those patients with CAP who were likely to benefit from treatment with drotrecogin alfa in the recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (or PROWESS) study. A reexamination of the data from that study demonstrated that a threshold CURB-65 score of \u2265 3 was associated with a decrease in the 28-day mortality rate in drotrecogin alfa-treated patients of 10.8% when compared to control subjects (p = 0.018) vs a decrease in mortality rate in treated patients in PSI classes IV and V of 9.7% compared to control subjects (p = 0.013).6\n",

In addition, the CURB-65 criteria correlated with the time to clinical stability, and thus a higher score was predictive of a longer duration of IV therapy and a longer length of hospital stay.

A study at a public hospital in the United States, with many indigent patients, showed that the PSI could not define the need for hospital admission if patients were homeless or acutely intoxicated, or if they did not have a stable home environment that allowed them to be discharged from the hospital while receiving oral antibiotic therapy.8 In one recent commentary,5 the suggestion was made to combine both of these prognostic scoring tools, recognizing that neither approach can stand alone. Low-risk patients (ie, PSI classes I to III or CURB-65 score of 0 to 1) can be managed at home if serious vital sign abnormalities (in the case of PSI) or comorbidities (in the case of CURB-65) are absent, and if patients do not have social factors or other illnesses that are unstable and that necessitate hospitalization. Moderate-risk patients (ie, CURB-65 score of \u2265 2 or PSI classes IV and V) probably should be admitted to the hospital, and clinical assessment should be used to separate those who need ICU care from those who are likely to become clinically stable rapidly and who would then require only a short hospital stay.",

PCT, the precursor of calcitonin, has no hormonal effects. Its value arises because serum levels are increased in severe bacterial infections, but not in viral illness. The release of PCT can be stimulated by microbial toxins (including lipopolysaccharide), cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6), and by the cell-mediated immune response. Levels can be attenuated by virus-induced cytokines (interferon-\u03b3). In a study11 of 185 patients who had PCT measured within 24 h of hospital admission for CAP, the levels correlated with PSI score (higher in classes III and V than in classes I and II) and the development of complications (higher with empyema, mechanical ventilation, and septic shock), and levels were also increased in those who died compared to those who did not. Interestingly, the levels were higher in patients with a low risk of mortality (ie, low PSI) with a bacterial etiology for CAP than in those without, but similar findings did not apply to those with more severe CAP.

Only 3% of all patients were not admitted to the hospital, making this primarily an inpatient study. With the use of PCT levels, 15% of patients had antibiotics withheld, compared to 1% of those receiving standard care. The use of PCT levels to guide therapy led to a significantly shorter duration of therapy that applied to all patients, regardless of PSI class.

Bolstered by these findings, the same investigative group collected serial PCT levels in 100 ICU CAP patients on day 1 and day 3.13 In the study, survivors had a decrease in PCT levels, while nonsurvivors had an increase by day 3. Numerous clinical parameters, were also measured, as well as serial levels of CRP, but in the multivariate predictors of mortality, the relevant factors were as follows: need for mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 9.9); presence of multilobar infiltrates (OR, 5.6); increasing PCT levels (OR, 4.5); and worsening of a multiorgan failure score.

Using data from 2002 to 2003, Doern et al14 studied 1,817 pneumococcal respiratory isolates from 44 US centers and observed that while penicillin resistance was present (34.2%), it was not occurring with an increased frequency. They found that 15.7% of isolates were intermediately sensitive and 18.5% were highly resistant to penicillin. On the other hand, macrolide resistance was increasing (although most was low-level, efflux pump-mediated), while trimethoprim-sulfa resistance was declining. Quinolone resistance rates were very low (< 1%), but 21% of the isolates had a first-step mutation (par C) that still permitted the antibiotics to be active. However, if a second mutation (gyr A) were acquired, these organisms could become quinolone-resistant, urging caution to observe trends in this type of mutation. In terms of reliable choices for suspected DRSP, quinolones remain effective, but ceftriaxone remained the most active \u03b2-lactam agent, with a 6.9% resistance rate. In clinical studies, ceftriaxone has been a reliable choice, even if DRSP is present, while, among the cephalosporins, cefuroxime is not a reliable choice since patients with bacteremia and in vitro resistance to this agent had a worse outcome than when organisms were sensitive to this agent.15\n16\n",

In the study, recent therapy with penicillin, macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfa, and quinolones (but not cephalosporins) was associated with a higher frequency of resistance to that same agent. Among all of the classes of antibiotics, the one with the greatest effect of recent therapy on subsequent resistance (ie, highest OR of an effect) was quinolones. This latter finding is consistent with case reports of lack of response to quinolones in CAP patients that documented recent quinolone therapy as a major risk factor.18 All of these data lend further support to the idea of \u201cpatient-specific antibiotic rotation\u201d in CAP, making sure that among all acceptable therapeutic alternatives the clinician takes a history of recent antibiotic use and chooses an agent that differs from what the patient had recently received.",

In the past several years, MRSA has been reported as a cause of sporadic cases of severe CAP, especially following a preceding viral infection.19 This pathogen is not the same as its nosocomial counterpart, having a different genetic makeup, different host susceptibility, and different virulence and antibiotic sensitivity. The community-acquired strain generally belongs to a single pulse-field gel electrophoresis type, the USA 300 strain. In addition, it carries the genes for the production of a necrotizing toxin, the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and it confers resistance to methicillin through the carriage of the type IV mecA gene, which is carried on the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (type IV SCCmec element).19 The cases that have been reported have been severe necrotizing pneumonias, generally in previously healthy individuals following viral infection or documented influenza illness. The pneumonia is often rapidly progressive, bilateral, and with shock, cavitation of lung parenchyma, and pleural effusion. The organism is sensitive to a wide range of antibiotics, including vancomycin, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfa, and gentamicin, with variable sensitivity to quinolones.19 The optimal therapy is yet to be defined, but one case series20 reported failure with vancomycin alone, which was overcome by either the addition of clindamycin or the use of linezolid. These findings may relate to the fact that clindamycin and linezolid can inhibit toxin production, and thus successful therapy may require both an antibacterial and an antitoxin form of treatment.",

In a study22 of 95 patients, > 65 years of age, who were admitted to the ICU from a long-term care facility with presumed aspiration pneumonia, the bacteriology of infection was studied using a protected BAL fluid sample that had been collected within 4 h of ICU admission. Aspiration was presumed to be present because patients had known risk factors such as intestinal or swallowing disorders, neurologic disease, and anatomic abnormalities that could lead to aspiration. The data demonstrated that Gram-negative pathogens were the dominant type of pathogen, and that anaerobes were present in only 11 of the 95 patients; in only 5 patients were anaerobes the only pathogens present22 (Fig 2\n). In another study of lung abscess,23 which is a disease that is commonly attributed to aspiration and anaerobic infection, 90 patients were evaluated with an \u201cuncontaminated\u201d specimen including transthoracic needle aspirate, pleural fluid, blood cultures, and specimens from a surgical sample, but not bronchoscopy samples alone. In this group, pure anaerobic infection was present in only 18 patients, and 10 others had mixed infection. However, aerobic Gram-negative pathogens were present in 37 patients, with Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from 28 patients. Thus, the level of involvement of enteric Gram-negative pathogens in these two aspiration-related illnesses is quite high and must be considered when selecting therapy.",

However, the study included only patients with mild-to-moderate illness, and patients were eligible for short-duration therapy only if their conditions had improved substantially with IV therapy by day 3. One correlate of these findings is that a hospitalized patient who becomes clinically stable with IV therapy could be safely discharged from the hospital without continued inpatient observation. A recent Medicare database study35 compared CAP patients who were not observed, and were discharged on the same day as the switch to oral therapy, to those observed for a day after the switch. There were no differences in the 14-day readmission rate and the 30-day mortality rate between the groups, emphasizing the safety of not keeping the patient in the hospital for observation after the switch from IV therapy.",

However, in a new study,37 therapy with systemic corticosteroids has been tested in patients with severe CAP, based on the idea that adverse outcomes are mediated by the inflammatory response to infection rather than by uncontrolled infection. In a small (48 patients), multicenter, randomized, blinded trial,37 therapy with a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone was compared to therapy with placebo. Although patients had severe CAP, not all of them were treated in an ICU. Steroid therapy led to significantly lower mortality, shorter length of ICU stay, and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. In addition, steroid therapy led to fewer late complications. Although the data are impressive, confirmation in a larger study is needed. Nonetheless, the findings do suggest that steroid therapy is not dangerous, even for patients with a severe infection such as CAP.",

Two recent studies41\n42 have added to the controversy. The first study41 confirmed that when therapy is provided in 4 h, mortality is reduced, but the predictors of increased time to antibiotic administration were altered mental status, absence of fever, absence of hypoxia, and increasing age. When these factors were controlled for, the timing of therapy had no impact on mortality, and thus the authors concluded that time to the administration of antibiotics is not a good quality measure. In support of these findings was another study42 that found that 22% of 86 Medicare patients with CAP presented with atypical clinical features that led to diagnostic uncertainty, which could appropriately lead to a delay in the administration of antibiotics. In an editorial accompanying these articles, the observation was made that time to the administration of antibiotics has only been demonstrated to affect mortality in patients > 65 year of age, and that the findings of these studies support the idea that 100% compliance with the standard would not necessarily mean good medical care; thus, the goal should be a lower number of patients given antibiotics within 4 h.38 The standard of antibiotic administration within 4 h is likely to change in 2007.",

While all patients admitted to the hospital may not need this testing, it may be wise to still collect blood cultures in those patients with signs of severe illness, and it is important to collect the cultures prior to antibiotic administration. Metersky et al43 studied 13,043 Medicare patients with CAP who had been admitted to the hospital to define the predictors of bacteremia. They found that certain populations (especially those who had received prior antibiotic therapy) were unlikely to have true positive culture findings; thus, a large percentage of positive results in these patients would be false-positive results and could lead to mistakes in management. The predictors of bacteremia were as follows: prior antibiotic therapy (OR, 0.5); comorbid liver disease (OR, 2.3); systolic BP < 90 mm Hg (OR, 1.7); fever < 35\u00b0C or > 40\u00b0C (OR, 1.9); pulse > 125 beats/min (OR, 1.9); BUN level of > 30 mg/dL (OR, 2.0); serum Na level of < 130 mEq/L (OR, 1.6); and WBC count of < 5,000 cells/\u03bcL or > 20,000 cells/\u03bcL (OR, 1.7). The most common pathogen found in blood cultures was pneumococcus, but 643 of 886 pathogens were contaminants. The authors suggested that patients who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have none of the severity/comorbidity risk factors listed above should not have blood cultures performed, since only 3% of patients had true-positive findings for bacteremias. Those without prior antibiotic therapy and no predictors, or those with prior antibiotic therapy and one predictor should have one blood culture performed since the incidence of true-positive results was 5%. Finally, the yield is high in those patients with two predictors (16% bacteremia) or in those with one predictor and no prior antibiotic therapy (9% bacteremia); these patients should have two blood cultures performed.",

One way to deal with this is to vaccinate all patients if there is any uncertainty about the history of vaccination, and that may be justified by the proven efficacy of the vaccine and the long-term consequences if pneumonia does develop in a patient. If this approach is used, it is reassuring to know that it is generally safe to administer repeat pneumococcal vaccinations more frequently than the recommended 5-year interval. A study44 evaluated 179 patients who had received at least three vaccinations and compared their clinical courses to those of 181 patients who had received either one or two doses. Even though 54.6% of those patients who were revaccinated received their repeat vaccinations in < 6 years, there was only one patient with an adverse reaction, which was described as tachycardia and arm redness. Thus, it appears to be safe to administer a vaccination, and although this is not to be done indiscriminately, if it is done, the benefits are likely to far outweigh any associated risks.",

The findings imply that the vaccination of a large segment of the at-risk population has a benefit for nonvaccinated patients by lowering the incidence and spread of invasive disease.45 Another database study46 evaluated the impact of prior pneumococcal vaccination on patients who had been hospitalized with CAP. Only 12% of 62,918 hospitalized CAP patients had received prior vaccinations, but this group was less likely to die from any cause, and had a lower risk of respiratory failure and other complications, as well as a reduced length of hospital stay, compared to patients who were not vaccinated.46\n",
