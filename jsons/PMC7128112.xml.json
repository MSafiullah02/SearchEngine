            "text": "Since 1983, when the baculovirus expression system (BES)\n1 was first used to express human beta interferon in insect cells [1], the BES has become a versatile and robust eukaryotic expression system for foreign protein expression. Two prototype members of the genus Alphabaculovirus\n[2] are broadly utilized in the BES as vectors to produce heterologous proteins in insect cells or silkworm larvae: namely Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and to a lesser extent Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). Either can express foreign genes under the control of highly expressed very late promoters, including polyhedrin (polh) and 10-kDa fibrous polypeptide (p10) promoters. The most commonly used lepidopteran insect cell lines are derived from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9 and Sf21) and Trichoplusia ni (Tn5, commercially known as High Five\u2122), which grow optimally at 27 \u00b0C and do not require CO2, making scale up of protein production feasible for most laboratories. Baculovirus expression of heterologous genes permits multiple post-translational modifications, like folding, oligomerization, phosphorylation, glycosylation, acylation, disulfide bond formation, proteolytic cleavage and so on, which are similar or identical to those occurring in mammalian cells. These advantages over prokaryotic expression systems make it possible to express multiple proteins simultaneously in a single infection and to obtain multimeric proteins sharing functional similarity with their natural analogs. Thus, the BES has been broadly used for the production of heterologous proteins and even the generation of virus-like particles (VLP) in laboratories [3], [4], as well as for the development of subunit vaccines, including VLP-based vaccines, in the vaccine industry [5], [6].",

VLPs are replication as well as infection incompetent, due to the absence of any infectious genetic material [7]. A close resemblance to native viruses in molecular scaffolds enables VLPs to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses even without adjuvant. VLPs have been constructed through co-expression and then self-assembly of their components in Escherichia coli (E. coli), yeasts, mammalian cells and insect cells. As a powerful eukaryotic expression system post-translationally modifying and processing the foreign proteins expressed in vitro or in vivo, the BES plays a critical role in self-assembly and release of VLPs. However, many studies have demonstrated the inability of lepidopteran cells to synthesize mammalian-type N-glycans [8], which was a limitation of the conventional BES [9]. In addition, the stoichiometry of VLP components, the self-assembly efficiency of structural proteins, and the budding process of enveloped VLPs are determined by the BES. In this article, we critically reviewed the pros and cons of using the BES to construct both enveloped and non-enveloped VLPs.",

However, the final virus stock unavoidably contains a mixture of parental and recombinant viruses, so a plaque-assay is required to purify the recombinant baculovirus [10]. An alternative approach has been developed [11] to circumvent this problem by generating a recombinant baculovirus using site-specific transposition with Tn7 to insert foreign genes into bacmid (baculovirus plasmid) propagated in E. coli. Based on the principle of site-specific transposition, a rapid and efficient BES (Bac-to-Bac\u00ae, Life Technologies) that can be used as an alternative way to generate recombinant baculoviruses was developed and is now widely used as another commercial BES. Additionally, a modified baculovirus vector harboring a mammalian promoter, known as BacMam vector, has been turned into a transient expression vector for gene delivery and high-level screening in mammalian cells [12]. The BacMam system combines the advantages of viral transient expression, ease of generation and a broad cell tropism, enabling rapid, efficient and flexible gene over-expression experiments to be performed in various mammalian cells [13].",

Due to intrinsic properties of the lipid membrane and surface glycoprotein, the generation of enveloped VLPs in insect cells is more complicated than that of non-enveloped VLPs. However, efficient budding of enveloped VLPs from insect cells has been reported from time to time [30], [31], [36], [38], [39], [45], [46]. For example, using a quadruple baculovirus recombinant, Latham and Galarza (2001) initially showed that co-expression of four structural proteins of influenza virus, the HA, neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein M1 and M2 ion channel protein, was sufficient for the self-assembly and release of VLPs from surface of insect cells. Furthermore, the VLPs closely resembled the authentic virions in size, morphology, and in the fine structure of the surface spikes [3].",

In comparison with other baculoviral promoters, both very late promoters provide abundant transcription of very late genes. The polyhedrin transcript represented approximately one-quarter of the viral polyadenylic acid-containing RNAs at 27 h post infection [53], thereby ensuring the production of the corresponding proteins in large amounts in the very late phase of infection. Furthermore, both the polh [54] and the p10 [55] genes are dispensable for the life cycle of baculoviruses. Thus, replacement of either of the gene coding sequences with that of another foreign gene in a recombinant baculovirus usually enables extensive expression of the heterologous protein, even more than 50% of the total protein in insect cells [56]. In general, the p10 promoter is more active at an earlier time post infection and reaches a lower maximum level than the polh promoter [57]. Under non-optimal conditions, the p10 promoter, however, would yield a higher level of expression than the polh promoter-driven expression [58], [59].",

Therefore, it would be possible to infer an improvement in complex glycosylation of foreign proteins required for the generation of VLPs, if the p10 promoter was used instead of the polh promoter. Genetic engineering of baculovirus facilitates both the insertion of foreign genes into these downstream promoter regions and the subsequent high level expression as well as self-assembly of heterologous proteins. A baculovirus with a certain gene present behind both promoters produced relatively more recombinant protein in host cells than those viruses driven with the polh or p10 promoters alone [59]. Nevertheless, the two promoters are activated at very late time post infection when the host machinery for post-translational modifications is no longer working properly due to gradual liquefaction of insect cells [61], [62], so the insect cells may not be able to achieve self-assembly of VLPs exactly. This may be a problem if the formation of VLPs depends on proper post-translational modifications.",

As described previously, the quadruple (pAcAB4) expression vector utilizing the polh and the p10 promoters has been constructed and commercialized, where each pair of different promoters was juxtaposed in identical orientation and the same promoters were segregated in opposite orientation. Using the quadruple vector, bluetongue virus double shelled VLPs consisting of four proteins were originally synthesized [23]. However, competition presumably occurs among promoters when different heterologous proteins are simultaneously co-expressed by one recombinant baculovirus in the same cells [64], thus inhibiting, to some extent, the protein expression and VLP production. Additionally, a novel and versatile BES, MultiBac, has been developed to allow simultaneous expression of multiple proteins in a single cell, which could be used to produce protein complexes and to recapitulate metabolic pathways [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]. The MultiBac system has been set up as an open-access platform technology at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Grenoble, France [66].",

Genetic modification based on chiA and/or cath deletions hampered the liquefaction of hosts to some extent, and thereby improved the expression of complex proteins, which has been confirmed by many research groups [71], [72], [73], [74].

In yeasts and mammalian cells, molecular mechanisms of protein folding have been identified in the ER [75], whereas in insects this issue has remained underexplored. Although heterologous protein folding in insect cells is more similar to mammalian cells than bacteria and yeasts, it is not always identical [76] and, for construction of VLPs, this may be critical. Enveloped VLPs generally contain membrane proteins, whereas expression of membrane-active proteins in infected insect cells is possibly hindered by the misfolding of polypeptides, resulting in the accumulation and/or precipitation of non-functional protein in or at the ER [77].",

Two main classes of chaperones investigated for use in the BES fall into two groups, namely those located in the ER and those in the cytosol. Calnexin, calreticulin and binding immunoglobulin protein are chaperones located in the ER where their expression has desirable effects on heterologous protein assembly; in the cytosol, Hsp70 has proven to be effective in increasing production efficiency by reducing the formation of aggregates, which would have otherwise been degraded [63]. In addition to these chaperones, a stably transformed insect cell line has been developed by engineering the folding pathway of insect cells, showing improved folding of a recombinant membrane protein. NinaA (neither inactivation nor afterpotential A) has been found to function in the ER and to directly interact with rhodopsin 1 ensuring correct folding of this membrane-bound protein in the rhabdomere of the fly [84]. Lenhard and Reil\u00e4nder (1997) transformed Sf9 cells with a gene encoding NinaA of Drosophila melanogaster, and demonstrated that the new insect cell line produced more functional, plasma membrane-localized human dopamine transporter than the old one [77]. The co-expression of chaperones and foldases may complement other approaches, such as the development of alternative insect cell lines to optimize the BES for generating high yields of VLPs.",

            "text": "Baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells has become well-established for the production of recombinant glycoproteins. Since several glycoproteins could readily be produced in many insect cell lines compared with mammalian cells [85], these insect cell lines were widely employed for glycoprotein expression [86], [87], [88]. Nevertheless, the conventional BES may not be the best tool for producing glycoproteins to generate complex VLPs especially for pharmaceutical purposes, as the insect cells-produced glycoproteins have clearly different N-glycans from those produced by mammalian cells [8], [89], [90]. Completion of N-glycans in insect and mammalian cells appears to follow a similar initial pathway but diverge at subsequent processing steps (Fig. 4\n) [89], [91]. Due to insufficient expression of multiple processing enzymes responsible for generating complex-type structures and metabolic enzymes involved in generating appropriate sugar nucleotides, N-glycans from insect cells are not usually processed to terminally sialylated complex-type structures but are generally instead modified to paucimannose structure [92]. Few studies have reported the use of O-glycosylation sites in insect cells [93], [94]. For instance, human interferon-\u03b1 2 expressed in Sf9 insect cells was O-glycosylated at the same position as the natural one [95]. However, like the N-glycosylation, the O-glycosylation potential depends on culture medium and insect cell types. One of the most predominant and consistent changes in the O-glycosylation potential of insect cells would occur, if the culture medium is altered. Such a resulting change may be attributed to the alteration of the corresponding glycosyltransferase activities with variation of culture medium constituents [96].",

For the modification of cells, a new cell line could be developed by glycoengineering insect cell lines with mammalian genes encoding protein N-glycosylation functions under the transcriptional control of constitutive promoters [9]. Okada et al. (2010) prepared and characterized Sf21 cells by transfection with a rat cDNA for \u03b21,4-N-acetylglucosa-minyltransferase III (GnT-III), showing that the GnT-III transfection has had the potential to be an effective approach in humanizing the N-glycosylation of lepidopteran insect cells [97]. For the modification of baculoviruses, a more sophisticated version of the MultiBac system was created by integrating sequences encoding Caenorhabditis elegans N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II and bovine \u03b21,4-galactosyltransferase I into the backbone of a baculovirus genome, resulting in a recombinant baculovirus designated as SweetBac. It has proven to be effective in the production of mammalianized glycoproteins in insect cells [98]. More recently, a new cell line, SfSWT-4, was generated by transforming Sf9 cells with six mammalian genes and has proven to produce sialylated glycoproteins when cultured with the sialic acid precursor, N-acetylmannosamine. Further, a daughter cell line, SfSWT-6, was isolated by super-transforming the SfSWT-4 with a human cytosine-5\u20195\u2032-monophospho-sialic acid transporter gene. The resulting SfSWT-6 cells had higher levels of cell surface sialylation and also supported higher levels of recombinant glycoprotein sialylation, particularly when cultured with low concentrations of N-acetylmannosamine [101].",

            "text": "A number of viruses consist of envelope glycoproteins, which are the primary target of protective immunity. Glycosylation generally affects protein folding, localization, solubility and antigenicity [102]. For many viruses, mutation of special glycosylation sites may be highly detrimental to the antigenicity and immunogenicity of glycoproteins [103], [104], [105], [106], [107]. Therefore, the inability to produce glycoproteins with structurally authentic mammalian N- or O-glycans, to a certain extent, limits the application of the BES for production of VLP-based vaccines. Undoubtedly, the variation of antigenic properties of VLPs is an awfully serious issue for VLP-based vaccines. Interestingly, for influenza VLPs, \u201cremoval\u201d of structurally nonessential glycans on VLPs surface glycoproteins may be a very effective and general approach for VLP-based vaccine design. Truncation of the N-glycan structures on HA can increase sialic acid binding affinities [104], and furthermore these structures are similar to those of insect cell-type N-glycans, which thereby can facilitate the uptake of influenza VLPs by antigen-presenting cells [108]. To date, enveloped influenza VLPs have been developed by biopharmaceutical companies and were demonstrated to induce protective immunity during preclinical and clinical studies [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115].",

Many studies have included amino acid sequence analysis of the N-terminus of the baculovirus-produced protein to confirm that the signal peptide cleavage site is identical to that observed in the original source [127]. However, other heterologous signal peptides may be inefficiently recognized by the protein translocation machinery in lepidopteran insect cells. The postulate has been verified by a previous study [128], revealing that secretion of plant propapain expressed in insect cells was improved by replacement of its native signal peptide with that from honeybee mellitin. Conversely, the other study has demonstrated that insect-derived signal peptides and/or prosequences could not always enhance the expression and/or secretion of foreign secretory pathway proteins in the BES, suggesting that the inability of insect cells to recognize the processing signals efficiently was probably not the major factor preventing high level production of foreign proteins [129].",

Additionally, there were several other studies [134], [135] independently to show that proteolytic processing contributed to generating VLPs in insect cells. Expression of immature precursor and subsequent proteolytic processing seem to be an effective strategy in formation of VLPs [136]. When the Flock House nodavirus (FHV) coat protein (CP) precursor (CP-alpha) alone was expressed in insect cells, virus-like precursor particle could be formed. It normally matured by proteolytic cleavage of protein alpha into polypeptide chains beta and gamma. The mature VLP was morphologically indistinguishable from authentic FHV.

To date, hundreds of cell lines from lepidopteran insects have been established. Despite use of the same BES, differences between distinct insect cell lines may cause the differences in the efficiency of VLP production. For example, VLPs of influenza subtypes H1 [110], H3 [137], H5 [138] and H9 [139] have been produced by co-expression of structural proteins in insect cells, all of which were the Sf9 cells. Nevertheless, comparison of VLP production in terms of yield and quality between Sf9 and Tn5 lines revealed dramatic differences in baculovirus background as well as in yield and density of VLPs: the Tn5 cells produced homogenous VLPs carrying more HA than their Sf9-derived counterparts and resulted in a much lower virus background of the final VLP preparation [140]. Significantly, the commercially available VLP-based vaccine, Cervarix\u2122, was also produced in the Tn5 cells [141]. Additionally, one research group demonstrated that the silkworm could produce higher levels of recombinant proteins than Sf9 cells, although the level of expression of soluble protein was higher in Sf9 cells than in the silkworm for all proteins except the membrane proteins [142]. These differences most likely reflect the great level of complexity of the biological systems in silkworms, compared with that in Sf9 cells. Despite the high-yield expression of recombinant proteins and especially membrane proteins in silkworms, it remains unclear whether the generation of VLPs in vivo is better than in vitro.",

Co-expression using polycistronic baculoviruses has been explored as a strategy to overcome the limitations inherent in the co-infection, namely the uneven distribution of individual virus infections in insect cell populations [63]. As shown in the Fig. 3, co-expression ensures that every protein necessary for the formation of VLPs is produced in a single infected cell. This principle is significant for the formation of structurally complex VLPs in the perspective of biological stoichiometry. However, polycistronic baculoviruses are often unstable and therefore it is difficult to achieve equivalent expression of different genes in one insect cell. In contrast, one advantage of the co-infection over the co-expression is that monocistronic baculoviruses can be rapidly produced if new genotypes or serotypes appear, and only one or two baculoviruses need to be replaced, reducing additional validation requirements for the formation of VLPs [145].",

The results showed that the co-expression was more efficient for production of such VLPs than the co-infection, which could be attributed to three major factors: (1) higher DNA replication rates presented by the tricistronic vector than the monocistronic vectors, (2) invariant mRNA stability for all three mRNAs, and (3) an excess of VP7 over VP6, both of which were produced by the co-expression, being more approximately equivalent to the VP7/VP6 stoichiometric ratio in the native virons [146]. Nonetheless, because the number of insect cells co-infected by all three baculoviruses could not be (or was not) measured, it was difficult to determine whether co-infection produced VLPs at a lower level. Nonetheless, another comparison [147] of the two strategies for the production of rotavirus VLPs indicated that virus DNA replication and transcription rates were appropriately 50% slower in the co-expression than in the co-infection experiments, which was contrary to the results of [146].",

Even though the probabilistic model could be used for a steady-state co-infection analysis for prediction of VLP composition, there were no models of the VLP assembly process until a kinetic and statistical-thermodynamic model was established for baculovirus infection and VLP assembly in suspended insect cells. This mathematical model could be used to characterize baculovirus infection, protein synthesis and more importantly VLP assembly in insect cells. The complete model suggested that the formation of infectious bursal disease virus VLPs was thermodynamically favorable and predicted well the baculovirus infection in individual cells or in cell population as a whole [152]. This model can potentially be used to further describe and optimize VLP formation for other virus pathogens. Despite the establishments of mathematical models for baculovirus infection for a long time, the total number of reports on application of models to optimize the production of VLPs is relatively scarce over the past decade.",

Although several reports have shown that gradient ultracentrifugation could be employed to purify rotavirus VLPs, it provided only low yield and failed to remove impurities from the final products [163]. Such a phenomenon of incomplete removal of impurities was also found in a recent experiment, whereby we tried to purify peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) VLPs from culture supernatant of Sf9 cells, which were infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing PPRV major structural proteins. However, the purified products by sucrose density gradient centrifugation have proven to be mainly mixed with recombinant baculoviruses (Fig. 5D).",

This novel method consisted of polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by a single anion exchange chromatography step, which could be completed within one day to purify norovirus VLPs produced using insect cells.

Alternatively, purified VLPs can be chemically inactivated to eliminate baculovirus infectivity [157], but this strategy may alter the antigenicity of VLPs. In addition to biophysical and biochemical separations, the use of vp80 gene-deleted baculovirus vectors has been presented as a novel strategy that would greatly simplify the downstream processing of biopharmaceuticals produced in insect cells, as it could prevent the release of progeny baculoviruses into the culture supernatant [167]. While there have not yet been any reports of VLP production using such gene-deleted baculoviruses, this new strategy would hold promise for the industrial production of VLPs in the near future.",

A large variety of VLPs have been produced using the BES, mainly owing to the high expression levels of foreign proteins and proper post-translational modifications in insect cells. The two VLP-based vaccines manufactured using the BES have been commercialized and proven to confer strong immune responses in vivo. Nonetheless, the differences in essential mechanisms between insect and mammalian cells, such as glycosylation and folding of heterologous proteins post translation, may hinder the formation of VLPs, especially structurally complicated VLPs. In addition, several manufacturing issues need to be addressed to achieve high-quality VLP upstream and downstream processing. The production of structurally complicated VLPs will benefit from improvements in downstream processes that could improve recovery yields without compromising VLP quality [168]. In conclusion, a long-term goal to accelerate the manufacturing capability of the BES for VLPs should be to revolutionize the conventional BES in order to improve protein quality (such as optimizing folding, enhancing glycosylation and preventing degradation) and to stabilize protein quantity over longer periods of time.",
