Interferon \u03b2-1b (165 residues) is modified from naturally occurring IFN-\u03b2 by deletion of the leading methionine and a single amino acid substitution (C17S).12 It is recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (IFN-\u03b2-1b; Betaferon or Betaseron). IFN-\u03b2-1a, recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, is identical to natural human interferon beta (166 residues) (IFN-\u03b2-1a; Avonex, Rebif). Although preparation and administration influence the immunogenic properties and the rate of antibody development, little is known about host factors that determine immune responses to IFN-\u03b2.13",

Avonex treatment was administered to 68 patients, and Rebif was given to 88 individuals and 86 patients received Betaferon. As expected, IFN-\u03b21a i.m.

Mean age was 39.8 yr in the first and 39.0 yr in the second group (Table 1). Average treatment duration was 57 months in the first and 52 months in the second group. The duration of the drug exposure did not differ significantly among treatment groups. All patients gave their written informed consent.

This bilateral approach was used for the initial study group as well as for the validation group. For identification of genetic variation of anti-IFN-\u03b2 formation, the continuous normalized antibody reactivities were directly compared among carriers of different alleles. In the binary-trait case-control study, patients were considered antibody positive (cases) if the anti-IFN-\u03b2 levels exceeded the 25% cutoff value. Otherwise, patients were considered antibody negative (controls). Additionally, antibody-positive patients were considered NABs positive if their MX1 mRNAs were reduced below 50% of MX1 levels of newly treated patients. The remaining antibody-positive patients who had not significantly reduced MX1 mRNA levels were considered BABs positive. For the testing of differences of location parameters for MX1 gene expression and anti-IFN-\u03b2 levels, the two-sided nonparametric Wilcoxon test was applied. p values were adjusted for multiple testing with the false-discovery rate (FDR). For identification of haplotype-specific associations with continuous (MX1 and anti-IFN-\u03b2 levels) and binomial trait types (NABS, BABs, and control subgroups), the genetic analysis package (gap) of the R Project for statistical computing was applied with score tests for association as described by 20,21. Haplotype-specific scores have been calculated with a score test for ambiguous haplotypes. The score statistics are given byU\u03b2=\u2211i=1N(yi\u2212y\u02dci)a(\u03d5)Ep(Xgi)where yi denotes the measured trait, y\u02dci a mean trait value, and a(\u03d5) a measure of variation. Ep(Xgi) denotes expectation value over the posterior distribution of the null hypothesis. The score statistics provide a measure for the covariation of a haplotype and the examined trait.21 However, this analysis has explorative character, because the results are based on the maximization of probabilities rather than a known linkage phase.",

Like IFN-\u03b2, 47 of these new biopharmaceuticals are derived from recombinant DNA technology.22 Applications range from the treatment of more prevalent rheumatic diseases (Ethanercept) to rare acquired or inherited disease with protein deficiencies (Galsulfase). It is predicted that many more therapeutic proteins will become available in the near future for an even wider range of indications.10 Despite their therapeutic potential, immunogenicity is a common problem to most, if not all, protein-based biopharmaceuticals and an important aspect of their safety. Antibodies might not only lead to the loss of drug efficacy but may also induce severe allergic reactions or neutralize the activity of endogenously produced protein.23 It has been argued that in the absence of resilient predictors of immunogenicity, patients might be put at a high risk.24 Preparation, handling, packaging, dose, frequency, and route of administration and treatment duration seem to affect immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals.25\u201327 However, the role of genetic factors in immunogenicity to protein-based therapeutics has not been addressed. In the present study we show that\u2014besides the influence of different preparations on immunogenicity\u2014genetic factors play an important role in the development of antibodies against protein therapeutics.

Although the HLA-DRB1\u22170401 or HLA-DRB1\u22170408 alleles increase the risk of developing antibodies in response to all IFN-\u03b2 formulations, it remains to be determined, in further studies and with a different study design, whether formulations with higher immunogenicity are more affected by the HLA haplotype than those with low immunogenicity.",

            "text": "These results are in line with the central role of T cells in eliciting B cell responses to protein targets: It seems that the peptide-binding motif of both alleles allows processing and binding of an IFN-\u03b2 peptide that breaks tolerance by promoting a strong T helper cell response to the IFN-\u03b2protein. This breakdown of tolerance promotes a B cell response that eventually leads to the development of an antibody production against the IFN-\u03b2 protein. It is striking that this effect critically depends on a single amino acid in the HLA-DRB1\u221704 allele sequence. The 86 G\u2192V substitution in HLA-DRB1\u221704 alleles is likely to interfere with elevated immunogenicity either by altering the binding affinity of the IFN-\u03b2 peptide because of secondary structure changes of the epitope-binding alpha helix or by affecting the presentation of the IFN-\u03b2 peptide itself. It seems that these two alleles influence the general likelihood of developing an antibody response independent of the IFN-\u03b2 preparation. Although antibody development was strongly affected by the alleles, the neutralizing activity of the antibodies was not significantly influenced by these HLA alleles. This suggests that both HLA-DRB1\u221704 alleles increase the likelihood of breaking tolerance to the protein by antibody production. Other factors, however, might determine whether the antibodies will neutralize IFN-\u03b2. One of those factors could be the intensity of an immune response to IFN-\u03b2. However, the rejection of the alternative hypothesis that the development of neutralizing antibodies is determined by HLA-DRB1\u221704 alleles might be due to insufficient test power and remains to be clarified in further studies.",

            "text": "Interestingly, HLA-DRB1\u22170401 has been associated with the development of autoantibodies against insulin. Congia et al. identified an immunodominant epitope in DRB1\u22170401 transgenic mice that would have been proteolytically destroyed under normal conditions. Additionally, this epitope was processed and presented by human DRB1\u22170401-positive Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells.28 First reports on the influence of HLA-DR4 serotypes in the development of porcine insulin antibodies date back to the early 1980s.29 The smaller glycine might endorse the binding of epitopes that contain larger amino acids in the vicinity of the substitution site or promote binding by a slight modification of the secondary structure. Although HLA-DRB1\u22170101 is similar to HLA-DRB1\u22170401 (both carry a glycine at position 86) and has analogous disease-modifying properties in MS, only HLA-DRB1\u22170401 influences antibody development to IFN-\u03b2.30,31 Although not significant in single-allele tests, the explorative haplotype analysis based on a score test for unkown linkage phase reveals a significant reduction of MX1 production in DRB1\u22170408-DQB1\u22170301 carriers. Additionally, haplotype analysis showed a significant increase of anti-IFN-\u03b2 reactivity and reduced MX1 mRNA expression in DRB1\u22171601-DQB1\u22170502 carriers, pointing to alleles other than DRB1\u22170401 and DRB1\u22170408 that might be associated with the development of binding and neutralizing antibodies. This is especially true for HLA-DRB1\u221716 alleles that also potentially increase the risk to develop antibodies against IFN-\u03b2. On the other hand, DRB1\u22171101 alleles seem to have a protective effect with respect to antibody production. It has been recently shown that trans interactions of HLA-DRB1 alleles play a significant role in the susceptibility to MS.32,33 Such trans interactions might also play a role in the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics. Hence, this study suggests that further genetic studies should be undertaken to clarify the influence of hereditary factors in immunogenicity of biotherapeutics and improve treatment decisions.",
