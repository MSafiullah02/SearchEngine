At 6 wk, approximately half of the rats (Group AL) were randomly selected to be allowed to continue to eat this diet ad libitum until killing at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo of age. The other half (Group FR) were restricted to 60% of the mean food intake of Group AL, on a per animal basis, until killing at the same ages (Fig. 1A). Food intake by AL rats was measured twice a week from the designated 25 rats of Group AL rats (total 150 rats for Group AL) throughout the study period and the amount ingested per day calculated. The food intake of AL rats was significantly increased with age (age main effect, P < 0.0001). FR rats were given their food allotment 1 h before the start of the dark phase of the light cycle.",

Other cDNA probes complementary to rat FSH\u03b2, TSH\u03b2, LH\u03b2, GH and PRL were obtained as follows: FSH\u03b2 (rat FSH pGEM 3) and TSH\u03b2 (RP21) probes were obtained from Dr. Richard A. Maurer, Oregon Health Science University (19,,20).For riboprobe synthesis, an EcoRV-PstI fragment of TSH\u03b2 clone in pBR322 (RP21) was subcloned to pBluescript II ks in our laboratory. LH\u03b2 (Sp64\u03b2rLH#1) probe was obtained from Dr. James L.

The riboprobes were synthesized from these cDNA probes with T7 RNA polymerase for FSH\u03b2 and TSH\u03b2, T3 RNA polymerase for GH and SP6 RNA polymerase for POMC, LH\u03b2 and PRL following reaction conditions specified by the vendor (Promega, Madison, WI) with 32P CTP (29.6 TBq/mmol, NEN, Boston, MA). Analyses for POMC, TSH\u03b2, FSH\u03b2, GH and PRL mRNAs were carried out by slot blot. Preliminary Northern blot analyses (24)using our riboprobes revealed single discrete positive bands for these mRNAs. Because Northern blot for LH\u03b2 mRNA revealed multiple bands, LH\u03b2 message was studied by solution hybridization and electrophoresis of the hybridized sample on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.",

These data are presented to aid interpretation of the effect of FR and age on specific mRNAs. Thus, when specific mRNAs are influenced by FR, even when normalized to total RNA abundance (e.g., POMC mRNA/\u03bcg total RNA), those changes are at least partly independent of effects of FR on the entire pool of RNA.

POMC mRNA was also not downregulated in our previous study of 3-mo-old AL and FR rats (9).One possible explanation for persistent elevation of POMC mRNA in FR rats is its relationship to the hyperadrenocortical status of FR rats (35).Although plasma concentrations of most hormones are reduced by FR (11,,36,,37)at least during early adulthood, the diurnal peak of plasma corticosterone is elevated in FR rats (12)and mice (38).Because POMC is the precursor of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates corticosterone synthesis and secretion, one might postulate that the elevation of POMC mRNA would be associated with elevated ACTH. However, diurnal plasma ACTH concentrations are not increased by FR (35).Clearly the relationship between POMC mRNA and ACTH secretion in FR rats is not straightforward. There is a drive to elevate POMC mRNA levels in FR rats that is blocked distally (i.e., at the level of translation, post-translational modification or secretion), such that circulating levels of ACTH are not concomitantly elevated. It is tempting to speculate that the unique elevation of POMC mRNA may provide a substrate reserve in FR rats for greater production of ACTH and corticosterone to better handle unusual stress, which has been postulated to play a role in the natural selection for the altered status of FR rats (39)",

            "text": "As we had seen before (9),FR suppressed GH mRNA at early ages. This report reveals that this effect is not sustained as the rats age. In our previous report, the effect was significant when the data were expressed per microgram RNA or as total amount per pituitary. In the current study, the effect was significant only when expressed as total GH mRNA content. It is noteworthy that the effect of FR on GH mRNA was much more transient than its effect on POMC and TSH mRNAs. By midlife, GH mRNA levels (per \u03bcg total AP RNA) did not differ between FR and AL rats, and by old age, levels of GH mRNA/\u03bcg RNA were higher in FR rats than in AL rats. Although complete age-course studies of circulating levels of GH have not been reported, our GH mRNA data roughly parallel and may thus explain in part the effect of FR on plasma GH. At early ages, FR reduces plasma GH levels (36,,37,,44).By contrast, in old rats, when GH levels of AL rats have fallen, FR sustains youthful pulsatility (44).It is also noteworthy that the age-related decline in GH mRNA in AL rats, which also occurred in TSH mRNA, did not occur in FR rats. Thus, FR, in addition to altering steady-state levels of hormone-encoding mRNAs in young and middle-aged rats, delays age-related changes in expression of specific pituitary mRNAs. Whether these age-retarding effects reflect actions of FR intrinsic to the pituitary or are secondary to effects of FR on aging of hypothalamic function (i.e., on hypothalamic releasing factors) is not known. This question deserves study to map more completely the action of FR on hypothalamic-pituitary-hormone action. Identifying hypothalamic or other higher centers that are central to regulating these changes is an important step in identifying the input metabolic or other types of signals that mediate this potentially important action of FR.",

However, after rats reached 12 mo of age, FR not only prevented the age-related decrease in these two messages, but actually resulted in an increase in their expression levels. Although serum gonadotropin levels have not been reported for aged FR rats, they are decreased in aging AL male F344 rats, a result that parallels our finding of a reduction in the cognate mRNAs for these hormones in AL rats. Although testosterone levels are also decreased in AL F344 rats, progesterone levels are markedly elevated (48,49,50).Gruenewald and colleagues (49)postulated that the elevated progesterone, through negative feedback at the hypothalamic-pituitary level, underlies the reduced gonadotropin levels of aged F344 rats. Elevated progesterone could also account for the suppression of gonadotropin mRNAs that we observed. Increased progesterone and reduced testosterone in AL F344 rats are believed to be consequences of the Leydig cell tumors that are common in aged F344 rats (48,,51).Because FR reduces the incidence of Leydig cell tumors (52),the absence of suppressed gonadotropin mRNAs in old FR rats may reflect reduced testicular tumorigenesis. Why gonadotropin mRNAs in old FR rats are elevated, however, rather than maintained at young values, is less apparent.",
