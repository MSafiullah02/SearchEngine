Infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus leads to the COVID-19 disease which can be fatal, especially in older patients with medical co-morbidities. The impact to the US healthcare system has been disruptive, and the way healthcare services are provided has changed drastically. Here, we present a compilation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric care in the US, in the various settings: outpatient, emergency room, inpatient units, consultation services, and the community. We further present effects seen on psychiatric physicians in the setting of new and constantly evolving protocols where adjustment and flexibility have become the norm, training of residents, leading a team of professionals with different expertise, conducting clinical research, and ethical considerations. The purpose of this paper is to provide examples of \"how to\" processes based on our current front-line experiences and research to practicing psychiatrists and mental health clinicians, inform practitioners about national guidelines affecting psychiatric care during the pandemic, and inform health care policy makers and health care systems about the challenges and continued needs of financial and administrative support for psychiatric physicians and mental health systems.",

In Italy, the head of one of the largest psychiatric services in Lombardy has described the changes to their system (Vita et al., 2020) . In the US, we have experienced the impact on access to care, quality, and the way care itself is delivered. Even legal doctrines and privacy rules have been bypassed to provide care in a totally different environment. The provision of psychiatric care has changed depending on the setting the psychiatric physician is working. To help physicians understand the many changes in delivery of care, the American Psychiatric Association has issued national COVID-19 practice guidance, summarized in Table 1 (APA Website, 2020).",

No visitor policies and suspension of group activities (Starace and Ferrara, 2020) have been utilized in some, but not all inpatient units.

Clinical research where patients consent to protocols has come to a halt. Like other medical specialties, major annual educational conferences have been canceled (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020) . Notably, the training of residents has been drastically affected, with residents being pulled away from psychiatric rotations to in some cases work in COVID positive settings as infectious disease and medicine interns would. At many institutions, didactic education, supervision, and outpatient visits are virtual. Medical students are not coming physically to rotations that are needed for practical experience and necessary for acquiring clinical knowledge.",

This has required adjustment in programming, such as learning how to utilize webcam-based services. For patients without smartphone or computer access, telephone-based encounters have become a standard of care. Faculty and residents alike have transitioned to completing the majority of outpatient care while working from home, and supervision of trainees has also been transitioned to virtual modalities. Such transitions have been largely welcomed but also challenging at times, especially when the required technology is slow to connect, malfunctions, there is a security breach and loss of confidentiality, or when providers are not familiar with certain technologies. There also are challenges for patients who are unable to access technology such as smartphones or do not have access to high speed internet. Furthermore, while many patients seem to have adapted to virtual visits and may even benefit from certain aspects, such as elimination of transportation barriers, some patients have communicated that they prefer in-person appointments.",

These patients are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic for two salient reasons. First, many substances such as tobacco or marijuana create a compromised pulmonary system, increasing susceptibility to more serious consequences of coronavirus infection. Second, patients with SUDs are more likely to be in a lower socioeconomic status, leading to poor access to care. Therefore, it is paramount to consider both the guideline changes regarding SUDs as well as the actual impact patients are facing. Many associations such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) have issued guidelines, as early as March 16, 2020. Specifically, methadone clinics are loosening restrictions and allowing methadone to be prescribed in higher quantities, and Suboxone can now be prescribed via telephone without an in-person visit (APA Website, 2020). Controlled substances can also be e-prescribed directly to pharmacies.

Many older adults are fearful of contracting the disease given the vulnerabilities unique of this demographic group. A significant portion of elderly patients are quarantined in their homes, resulting in social isolation and loneliness, which can fuel anxiety and depression. Connecting with these individuals is essential to provide treatment for acute psychiatric concerns as well as continued treatment of chronic illness. However, elderly patients may be less likely to use technology and may have greater difficulty adapting to telepsychiatry. Finding creative means to delivering care such as incorporating assistance from family members and caregivers may be especially important for this vulnerable population.",

The care of patients seeking or referred for emergent psychiatric evaluation has also been impacted by the present pandemic. Many facilities have implemented screening protocols asking the same questions (Table 2) to triage patients for risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus and to assess level of symptoms. These protocols have evolved throughout the course of the pandemic. Initially patients deemed to be at elevated risk of exposure or demonstrating symptoms of COVID-19 were referred for supplemental medical evaluation, and in appropriate cases, testing. Now, in most healthcare systems, patients referred for inpatient psychiatric admission receive rapid COVID-19 testing prior to being evaluated by the psychiatrist and then in addition can be admitted to an appropriate unit. Some patients have expressed fear of contracting coronavirus by being in an emergency room setting, adding to their sense of suffering. To reduce risks to patients and staff alike, many consults and evaluations can be conducted using telephone visits. The physician can sit outside of the room, maintaining physical distancing, and complete an interview. They also can wait for potential cases to evaluate outside of the emergency room setting. Staff also are encouraged to physically distance from the patients. To mitigate risk of infection among staff, some hospitals are transitioning to a shift work model. Other hospitals, for a myriad of reasons, have been slow to implement such a measure.",

Furthermore, there are logistical factors to consider, such as shared bathrooms and sleeping rooms. Elements to contingency planning include (Li 2020) : a) disease precautions (screening, re-screening, personal protective equipment, use of designated clothing, cleaning of surfaces, and disinfection ); b) restriction of visitors and minimization of non-essential contacts (e.g. medical students (Moszkowicz et al., 2020) ); c) physician workforce considerations (creating back-up pools, job reassignment); d) operational adjustments (creating isolation rooms in psychiatry inpatient units, tightening criteria for psychiatric admission); and e) group therapy changes (limiting number of participants, utilizing physical distancing). As reported elsewhere and from experience, it is crucially important to have organized leadership, clear communication, and involvement of all disciplines in decision making (Li 2020) .",

At various hospitals, psychiatric units have opened to provide acute inpatient care for psychiatric patients presently infected with the novel coronavirus, but not medically ill enough to be hospitalized on an infectious disease unit. Infection Control subsections have been at the forefront with respect to collaboration, design and planning for the COVID-19 units. One challenge in providing this level of care is the difficult-to-predict course of a patient's infection. While patients admitted to this unit are discussed with internal medicine colleagues and determined to be medically stable on admission, some patients develop complications and require transfer to a medical unit. This is especially important to consider in psychiatric facilities where access to emergent interventions, such as intubation, is limited and patients must be brought by ambulance to the nearest medical facility.",

The current inpatient environment in some hospitals can preclude this treatment to balance the risks of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the combination of less face to face interaction, decreased in-person programming, restricted dining to in-room meals instead of communal dining and the \"no visitors policy\" is likely contributing to a decrease in the effectiveness of a therapeutic milieu on the psychiatric ward.

These responses can stem from either events happening in one's own life (e.g., a family member being diagnosed with COVID-19 , or fear of losing a loved one), one's work environment (new protocols to follow, ever-changing and unclear guidance on personal protective equipment), or the interplay of both (being exposed to a patient with COVID-19 at work, and then having to quarantine and isolate oneself from family for 14 days). In general, the need for psychiatric treatment by psychiatrists is increasing, and they are finding work hours becoming longer, and much needed vacation time being cancelled by their places of employment in some instances. Certain phenomena are also becoming more evident as staff compare their roles to that of others on the team or in the healthcare system. For example, some nurses or physicians whose duties require them to be physically present in the hospital engender resentment toward those who work remotely.

This would include any information pertinent to a patient's medical decision-making process. If patients are, in fact, at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to psychiatric hospitalization, disclosing such information would seem critical. In addition, many psychiatric patients are admitted on 72-hour emergency commitments. This takes on new ethical meaning in the midst of the pandemic. To our knowledge, there is no literature discussing how hospitals are addressing this issue. We similarly found no evidence that patients are being informed that psychiatric hospitalization may increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19, or that patients are being included in the decision to bear that risk. As more psychiatric patients contract the virus, addressing these issues may be increasingly urgent and ethically necessary.

            "text": "At times, this crisis has required psychiatrists to weigh the importance of various ethical principles, and effectively prioritize one in favor of another. The virtualization of patient care using video conferencing platforms is one example of this dilemma. Virtual encounters support the principle of nonmaleficence by reducing risk of viral transmission while still enabling the provision of care, and therefore beneficence. However, these principles are achieved at the expense of patient privacy, as video conferencing platforms have variably robust security that does not meet the privacy standards set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). For psychiatrists, compromising patient privacy is particularly precarious given the uniquely sensitive nature of mental health information, from both a personal and legal standpoint. Fortunately, this question was addressed by Federal policy, which specifically allowed for the use of such platforms despite potential risks to patient privacy (Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). The weight of this ethical dilemma, at least, did not fall on individual providers. When policymakers cannot keep pace with the pandemic and fail to address ethical dilemmas as quickly as they are encountered, are individual physicians forced to face these challenges alone? Perhaps this is the most significant ethical burden facing physicians, and particularly psychiatrists, in the age of COVID-19: being asked to answer complex ethical questions in real-time; questions that even experienced policymakers have not yet answered.",

Psychiatric residencies are faced with coming up with creative solutions to address these key components of providing a strong training foundation in the midst of constantly changing policies, residents being pulled from rotations and being redirected to meet the needs of services, social distancing requirements, and infection precautions. These are unprecedented times that have allowed us to try new strategies to engage learners including virtual meetings and self-directed learning.

            "text": "Concerns of psychiatric physicians across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic Class Example Personal prevention What personal protective equipment (PPE) is available for me in my work setting? How does the frequent change in guidance about PPE affect my trust in the system and guidance? How effective is a surgical mask, N95 mask, face-shield or goggle, gloves, or gown to prevent infection? Given limited supply, will I be forced to prove my worthiness as essential in order to obtain these? Am I eligible to be tested for the coronavirus? Which is the best test? Personal treatment If I get infected, what treatment is available? Since there is no FDA approved treatment, how effective are experimental treatments like hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir? Will I live or die? Effects on others What if I catch the disease and spread it to my children and elderly parents? What if I bring it home from work and spread it to my roommates? If I catch the disease how will I continue caring for and/or breastfeeding my infant? Will I need to delay further childbearing due to my workplace exposures? Economic stress How will this pandemic disrupt my income? Will my patient panel change and will I be asked to work fewer or longer hours? What if I can't adjust to providing care via telehealth and that's the only option at this moment in my setting? What if I am required to be physically present as essential, and I only feel safe working remotely? Will I lose my job? Will I quit? What if I have preexisting conditions and am at high risk to die if I catch the infectionshould I quit my job altogether and risk financial stress versus work and risk exposure and death? Ethical considerations for self How do I balance the tenets of the Hippocratic oath while also working in systems that may not be optimized for prevention, with a risk that I may die? Ethical considerations toward others How do I properly provide informed consent at time of psychiatric admission around risk for COVID-19 infection while the patient is on the psychiatric unit? How can I conduct HIPPA-compliant telepsychiatry interviews from home with my family present? How do I balance providing voluntary professional services to others in need whilst I struggle to maintain afloat financially? If I am trained to be a physician, does this mean I should answer the call to front-line service and if I don't, am I guilty of not serving my profession well? Training considerations Will this pandemic affect my learning opportunities? Will I attain all competencies required for graduation? If I get quarantined or sick, will that affect my graduation date? How do I respond to policy that makes me feel unsafe? Is quitting even an option for trainees?",
