Once again it is important to talk about the timing of application. Nobody would consider intubating a patient with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 between 250 and 300, although it is precisely in this category of patient that NIV could act best as prevention to avoid a subsequent worsening. This concept is supported by Cosentini et al. (2010) who used this philosophy in the treatment of patients with pneumonia, ventilating the patients with CPAP through a helmet in the Accident and Emergency department. CPAP delivered by helmet rapidly improved oxygenation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia suffering from a moderate hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. This trial represents a proof-of-concept evaluation of the potential usefulness of CPAP in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.",

A review of the literature leads us to be very prudent concerning the use of NIV. One study always reported as a ''positive'' one was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Antonelli and colleagues, who demonstrated that an improvement in oxygenation 1 h after starting treatment could be obtained by using either traditional intubation or NIV, with the latter being associated with a significant reduction in severe complications (Antonelli et al. 1998 ). The study by Antonelli is certainly robust and well designed and has, therefore, become one of the most frequently cited works in the literature; nevertheless, due care should be taken before generalizing its results. First of all, the study is often referred to as having been carried out in patients with ARDS, whereas only about 25 % of the population studied had this syndrome; furthermore, the study was performed in a single center in a hospital in which the team was particularly experienced in and enthusiastic about NIV, limiting the certainty that the results could be reproduced in every intensive care unit. A Chinese study ) is probably the first randomized controlled trial comparing NIV versus high-concentration oxygen in patients with mild ARDS, according to the new Berlin definition (i.e., those patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio [ 200 \\ 300). A total of 21 patients were assigned to NIV and 19 to the control group. The proportion of patients requiring intubation was lower in the former group, and there was also a tendency to reduced mortality in this group.",

Of these cases just under a half had to be intubated subsequently because of a poor response to NIV.

However, once again, a series of problems related to the study should be pointed out, starting with the limited experience that most of the centers involved had with NIV and finishing with the strange results obtained in the control group in which NIV could be used as rescue therapy.

We all hope that the alarm created by these pandemics is unjustified and the day of the apocalypse will never come, but let us consider that it will. Someone is going to have to explain to us where all the hundreds, if not thousands, of patients will be treated. The number of beds in intensive therapy units would clearly be insufficient, as would the availability of the more technologically advanced ventilators; furthermore, intubation is usually performed after sedation and neuromuscular blockade, which can only be done by specialists. We will, therefore, be asked to make dramatic choices between who does or does not ''deserve'' treatment. Perhaps, after all, we should think about alternative strategies, such as NIV, for the people who are still not very seriously ill and who could even be treated outside intensive care units. This is not a completely unrealistic hypothesis because it is actually supported by some observational studies carried out in China during the outbreak of SARS. These studies demonstrated the efficacy, but above all the safety and feasibility, of NIV in this situation. In particular, one of these studies showed that of more than 100 healthcare workers who had been involved in using NIV, none had developed the disease or become positive for the coronavirus. Of course, all this was obtained by taking the right precautions such as admitting the patients to negative pressure rooms, and supplying the workers with special protective overalls and helmets. We should point out that not using these safety measures could put both the staff and patients at a real risk of infection since aerosol particles are sprayed for almost a meter during the phase of expiration of NIV.",
