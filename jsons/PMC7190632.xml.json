Establishment of infection in the new host requires viruses to adapt to the efficient use of entry receptors and circumvent innate antiviral defense mechanisms that are unique to each host species2. The elaborate mechanisms underlying such changes that govern new virus-host dynamics are not well known. Bats are speculated to be reservoirs of several emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans, and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS) in pigs3\u20136. Although bats harbor SARS- and MERS-like coronaviruses, overt signs of disease in bats that are naturally or experimentally infected are often undetectable7. In contrast, infections in spillover species, such as humans and pigs lead to diseases with high morbidity and mortality7\u201313.",

MERS-CoV belongs to the betacoronavirus lineage 2c. Multiple 2c coronaviruses, such as HKU4, HKU5 and NeoCoV have been detected in bats19,20. Coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV rapidly adapt to the species they infect.

We show for the first time that cells from an insectivorous bat, Eptesicus fuscus, can be persistently infected with MERS-CoV over a period of several months. Disrupting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated antiviral signaling pathways and inhibiting MAP kinase pathways in these cells lead to an increase in virus replication.

To determine if persistently infected bat cells had selected for mutant variants of MERS-CoV, we sequenced the genome of the virus from persistently infected bat cells that had been passaged 15 times, over 4 months. We detected point mutations in the virus polymerase, spike and matrix genes (Fig. 3a) but none of these mutations disrupted the coding sequences for these proteins (Table 1). However, we observed a 341 base pair deletion in ORF5. In addition, there was a frameshift mutation at the N-terminal end of the protein that introduced a stop codon at the 20th amino acid position (Fig. 3a and Table 1). In theory, the intact ORF5 coding sequence in the bat-adapted MERS-CoV strain would encode a putative 19 amino acid long protein. To identify when the ORF5 deletion mutant (\u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV) was selected for during the establishment of persistently infected bat cells, we sequenced ORF5 from early and late passage cells. As early as passage two, the detectable virus population in culture comprised of the ORF5 mutant. In the following portion of this article, we refer to the original human-derived virus as the MERS-CoV wildtype virus (W+) and the ORF5 deleted variant as ORF5 mutant (\u0394ORF5) MERS-CoV.",

We recovered and sequenced ORF5 coding sequences from these cells at passages 2, 3 and 4. We detected a point mutation in ORF5 as early as passage 2, which resulted in a stop codon in the coding sequence for ORF5. In theory, the stop codon would terminate the protein at the 107th amino acid. We confirmed this point mutation in ORF5 by sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells at passage 15 (Table 1). As with the previous attempt to persistently infect Efk cells with MERS-CoV, we observed point mutations in genes other than ORF5. However, unlike in ORF5, the other point mutations did not disrupt the coding sequences for other proteins (Table 1). The additional point mutations were at different sites compared to changes that were observed in the first attempt (Fig. 3a and Table 1). The possible effects of these point mutations have been summarized in Table 1. To determine if the replication kinetics of \u0394ORF5 were different from W + MERS-CoV, we infected bat and human cells with a high MOI of W+ and \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV. \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV replicated better in bat cells, whereas W + MERS-CoV replicated better in human cells (Fig. 3b).",

The co-evolution of CoVs and bats, and the advantage of long-term CoV infection, if any, have not been explored in bats. In this study, we observed \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV as the dominant strain in persistently infected bat cells in two independent experiments. To identify if infection with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV confers a survival advantage upon bat cells, we determined if persistently infected bat cells were resistant to superinfection with W + virus. To differentiate between W+ and \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV replication, we examined the levels of genomic (upE) RNA (present in both strains), and ORF5 transcripts, (detectable in W + MERS-CoV only). On re-infecting persistently infected bat cells with W + virus (MOI = 1 TCID50/cell), we did not observe an increase in upE or ORF5 RNA levels in the superinfected cells, suggesting a lack of replication of W+ and \u0394ORF5 virus at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, we observed a significant increase in upE and ORF5 transcript levels at 24- and 48-hours post infection of na\u00efve bat cells that were infected with an equal amount of W + MERS-CoV (Fig. 5a,b). Immediately following infection, ORF5 transcripts in superinfected bat cells (\u0394ORF5 + W + MERS-CoV) were significantly higher than in persistently infected bat cells (Fig. 5b), but the expression levels did not increase over time, suggesting that W + virus did not replicate and that the initial difference was due to input virus. MERS-CoV uses DPP4 as a receptor for cellular entry and both MRC5 and Efk cells contained comparable amounts of DPP4 transcripts (Fig. 5c \u2013 right panel). To determine if the persistently-infected cells were resistant to infection by W + MERS-CoV because of reduced DPP4 expression, we measured relative amounts of DPP4 transcripts in the samples described in Fig. 5a,b. Efk cells infected with W + MERS-CoV contained high levels of DPP4 transcripts, which did not decrease significantly in the 48 hrs following infection (Fig. 5c). While we could amplify DPP4 transcripts in all cells (see gel insert in Fig. 5c), in contrast to na\u00efve Efk cells infected with W + MERS-CoV, the persistently infected cells contained almost 100 fold (average \u2212 \u0394\u0394CT values of 6.1) less DPP4 transcripts. These levels did not change significantly in the 48 hrs following infection with W + MERS-CoV.",

We observed that: a) Infection of bat cells led to a long-term persistent infection. b) The viability of the cells in culture did not depend on the presence of uninfected resistant cells, as seen in some models of coronavirus persistence43. All bat cells in culture contained viral RNA and protein. c) Viral persistence was accompanied by the rapid selection of mutations in the accessory gene \u2013 ORF5, and this mutation was \u201cfixed\u201d for at least 15 passages of the culture over 4 months. While viral persistence was accompanied by mutations in other genes, none of the mutations appeared to be as drastic as the ORF5 mutations. The genomic locations of other mutations in MERS-CoV also varied between the two independent attempts at establishing persistence. d) The \u0394ORF5 mutant virus replicated more efficiently in bat cells than W + MERS-CoV, and cells infected at high MOIs by the \u0394ORF5 mutant contained higher levels of some interferon-stimulated and anti-apoptotic transcripts. e) Cells persistently infected with the \u0394ORF5 mutant were resistant to infection by W + MERS-CoV. Compared to uninfected or W + MERS-CoV-infected Efk cells, cells persistently-infected with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV expressed greatly reduced levels of DPP4 transcripts, the known receptor for W + MERS-CoV. f) Persistence was maintained by the retention of higher basal levels of cellular interferon response, as suppression of the response by down-regulating IRF3 increased virus replication.",

Due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA polymerase, the laboratory stock likely contains variants that are less successful for replication in primate cells than the W + virus. These mutants include some with alterations in the ORF5 gene that render the virus less cytolytic for bat cells. Infection of bat cells at a low MOI leads to the infection of cells by either the W+ or \u0394ORF5 mutant virus. Due to the cytolytic nature of the W + virus, cells infected by it die with the subsequent release of more W + virus. While cells infected by the less cytolytic \u0394ORF5 mutants also produce virus, they survive. \u0394ORF5 mutant virus infected cells survive because the virus induces a more robust innate antiviral response in these cells and the apoptotic processes that accompany W + virus infection are dampened (see IFI6 expression; Fig. 4b). Since infection with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV renders bat cells resistant to infection by W + virus, W + virus is eventually replaced in the culture by \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV. Persistence is maintained by elevated levels of basal innate antiviral responses in these cells and suppression of this response leads to an increase in viral replication and cell death.",

The two proteins co-localized in the ER indicating that the protein coded by ORF5 is associated with the ER (see Supplementary Fig. S4b). Given these data, we have suggested an ER-associated structure of the ORF5 protein with its carboxyl terminal portion in the cytoplasm (see supplementary Fig. S4c). Interestingly, several bat beta coronaviruses also possess an ORF5 homologue. However, the putative cytoplasmic domains of these proteins differ from those of human and camel MERS-CoV isolates at specific residues (see Supplementary Fig. S4d). While the role of MERS-CoV ORF5 in adaptation for replication in different hosts will require further investigation, based upon the reduced cytotoxicity of ORF5 deletion mutant, we hypothesize that the protein promotes ER-stress induced apoptosis. Viruses with a deleted ORF5 gene or gene specifying a deleted (or mutated) carboxyl terminus would be less likely to trigger apoptotic cell death in ER-stressed persistently infected cells.",

This phenomenon may explain the rapid selection of the mutant (\u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV) and dilution of W + virus. While we have not clearly established the molecular mechanisms that render the persistently infected cells resistant to superinfection, our results indicate that down-regulation of DPP4, the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV (Fig. 5c) in the persistently infected cells provide an explanation. While we detected DPP4 transcripts in the cells (Fig. 5c), the levels in persistently infected cells (relative to a universally expressed house-keeping gene) were about a hundred times lower than in W + MERS-CoV infected na\u00efve Efk cells.",

The mechanisms by which infected cells are rendered resistant to further infection vary, but often rely on the occlusion of receptors for the superinfecting virus. We found that the levels of DPP4 transcripts in infected cells did not decrease following infection of Efk cells with either W + or \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV (Figs. 4f and 5c). This suggests that during a normal infection at a high MOI, MERS-CoV does not down-regulate the expression of the receptor. However, a lack of bat specific immunological reagents prevented us from detecting bat DPP4 on the surface of MERS-CoV infected Efk cells, so we cannot rule out a decrease in the expression of the protein on the cell surface or occlusion by the viral spike protein.",
