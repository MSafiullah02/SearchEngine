Furthermore, CRD is the most common disease in older calves (Gardner et al., 1990, Svensson et al., 2006), and pneumonia the overall most common cause of mortality in dairy calves and replacement heifers (Agerholm et al., 1993, Svensson et al., in press). Svensson et al. (2003) and Svensson et al. (2006) reported an increased risk of CRD in calves housed in large group pens with automatic milk feeders, compared to individually housed calves. In Sweden, the use of group housing systems is increasing, especially the use of large group pens with rationalised milk feeding (Pettersson et al., 2001), and hence increased problems with CRD can be expected unless proper measures are taken. CRD was also found to be the most common indication for antibiotic drug use in Swedish calves (Ortman and Svensson, 2004).",

However, secondary bacterial infections, e.g. Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica and Haemophilus somnus are not uncommon (Radostits et al., 2000).

Firstly, a generalized linear mixed model with test result (0 = test negative; 1 = test positive) as outcome was constructed for each test and each S-Hp cut-off value, using the GLIMMIX procedure of the SAS software package, Version 9 (SAS Systems) and a logit link. Considering all different tests and eight different S-Hp cut-off values, 25 models were thus constructed. Apart from the disease status (CRDtest: 0 = no; 1 = yes), variables representing parity of the dam, breed, sex, rectal temperature, month of year, and week of age were tested for inclusion as predictors. Only sex and rectal temperature were statistically significant (P\n \u2a7d 0.05 in most cases). Sex was retained in all models, rectal temperature was retained in the model of the HP(T\u2212) and HP(T+) tests, while the remaining predictors (P\n > 0.05) were omitted. To account for herd-level clustering, herd was included in all models as a random-intercept effect. The overall model fit was good (generalized Chi-square statistic divided by its degrees of freedom 0.97\u20131.03). Based on point estimates of the regression coefficients from the models, test sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were calculated separately for each model as described by Dohoo et al. (2003).",

The areas under ROC curves (AUC) were calculated non-parametrically by summing up trapezoid segments, as a measure of the discriminative ability of each test. AUC together with Se and Sp estimates were used to choose the test with the best performance. For each test the optimal S-Hp cut-off value was determined, given equal priorities to type I and type II errors, by selecting the point on the ROC curve closest to the upper left corner of the diagram, i.e., minimizing the distance d\n = ((1 \u2212 Se)2\n + (1 \u2212 Sp)2)0.5. Predictive values for positive and negative tests were calculated from the Se and Sp estimates for a CRD prevalence between 10% and 50%.",

Similarly, Alsemgeest et al. (1994) found that S-Hp did not increase in very acute inflammatory conditions such as peracute pneumonia. In fact, they found the largest concentrations in animals with serious, often chronic inflammatory diseases. However, Eckersall et al., 2001, Horadagoda et al., 1999 reported haptoglobin to be more affected by acute than chronic conditions.

It could for instance be used as a key figure in herd health services, animal welfare programmes, or to follow up prophylactic measures to reduce CRD problems. The usefulness of individual S-Hp sampling for herd-level diagnosis will depend on the prevalence of disease and the number of calves sampled, as well as on the age of the calves at sampling in relation to the onset of the CRD. In the present study the age at sampling coincided well with the age when the calves developed the disease.",

Our results further support that S-Hp, when combined with rectal temperature may be a valuable parameter in herd-level diagnostics at least in heifers. Our data comprised only nine herds and further field studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the test.",
