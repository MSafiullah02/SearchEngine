Yolk provides much of the nutrition for the embryo during incubation directly through the circulation, whereas close to hatch and thereafter yolk also reaches the GI tract (Noy and Sklan, 1998). It has been shown that during the initial 48 h posthatch, yolk contributes to small intestinal maintenance and development. During this period, the chick must make the transition from utilizing energy in the form of lipid supplied by the yolk to utilization of exogenous carbohydrate-rich feed (Noy and Sklan, 1999).",

The timing and form of nutrients available to chicks after hatch is critical for development of intestines. Early access to feed has been shown to stimulate growth and development of the intestinal tract and also enhance posthatch uptake of yolk by the small intestines (Uni, et al., 1998; Geyra et al., 2001; Noy and Sklan, 2001; Noy et al., 2001; Potturi et al., 2005). It has also been demonstrated that supplying nutrients to the growing embryo through in ovo feeding may enhance the development of the intestinal tract. Administration of exogenous nutrients into the amniotic fluid at 17 to 18 d of incubation enhanced intestinal development of chicks by increasing the size of the villi and by increasing the intestinal capacity to digest disaccharides. These observations indicated that small intestines of in ovo-fed chicks were functionally equivalent to conventionally fed 2-d-old chicks. Body weight of those chicks was greater than controls (Tako et al., 2004). In another experiment with turkeys, it was shown that the in ovo-fed poults (injection of arginine and \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methyl-butyrate into amnion) hatched with a greater intestinal digestive and absorptive capacity than the conventional poults (Foye et al., 2007).",

The GALT activity was determined by antibody production (systemic and locally in the gut), distribution of B and T lymphocytes in the gut, expression of lymphocyte-specific genes, and distribution of B and T lymphocytes in the bursa. It was shown that, although development of GALT in the foregut (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) was only slightly and temporarily impeded by feed withholding, GALT activity in the hindgut was significantly delayed during the first 2 wk of life. Systemic and intestinal antibody responses following rectal immunization to antigen were lower, colonization of the hindgut (cecum and colon) by T and B lymphocytes was delayed, as well as the expression of T-lymphocyte specific genes in the hindgut. It was also found that the increase of B and T cell population sizes in the bursa was delayed with time.",

This process starts from a sterile gastrointestinal environment at the moment of hatching and continues toward establishing a relatively stable status as the animal ages (Richards et al., 2005; Verstegen et al., 2005). It has been shown that the composition of the microflora changes in relation to the age of the chickens, dietary factors, breed, and geographic location (Salanitro et al., 1974, 1978; Apajalahti et al., 2001; Knarreborg et al., 2002; Van der Wielen et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2003). Apajalahti et al. (2002) have shown that one day after hatch, bacterial densities in the ileum and cecum of the broiler chicks reach 108 and 1010 cells per gram of digesta, respectively. The numbers of microbes reach 109 per gram of ileal digesta and 1011 per gram of cecal digesta during the first 3 d posthatch and remain relatively stable for the following 30 d. Provision of intestinal microflora of healthy adult birds to newly hatched chicks resulted in protection against intestinal infections including different types of Salmonella and also had positive impact on growth rate (Nurmi and Rantala, 1973; Goren et al., 1984, 1988).",

The cost associated with these benefits may include competition with the host for nutrients, stimulation of rapid turnover of absorptive epithelial cells, secretion of toxic compounds, and induction of an ongoing inflammatory response in the GI tract. All these effects occur at the expense of animal production performance (Drew et al., 2003; Richards et al., 2005; Verstegen et al., 2005). As stated earlier, the intestinal microbial profile can be affected by the diet, and changes in dietary composition can alter the microbial community.

Feeding whole wheat to broiler chickens reduced the numbers of Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of the birds (Engberg et al., 2004; Bjerrum et al., 2005). Inclusion of whole wheat into the diet increased feed conversion efficiency in some studies (Plavnik et al., 2002), whereas others have not found any positive impact on feed efficiency. Svihus et al. (2004) found no significant effects of diets containing whole wheat on body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency, but results showed that nutrients were more efficiently digested and absorbed from these diets compared with diets with ground wheat. It was suggested that these improvements may result from increased pancreas and liver secretions. In another study on the effect of wheat form (ground or whole) on passage rate through the anterior GI tract, it was demonstrated that although the gizzard has a remarkably high capacity for processing diets with whole wheat, the average passage rate for a diet through the gizzard does not seem to be affected by the form of the wheat (Svihus et al., 2002).",

(2002) found no effect of feeding whole wheat on performance of birds before infection with coccidiosis or during recovery from the infection. There were significant increases in activity and size of the gizzard and pancreas in whole wheat-fed birds. This increase in gizzard size is in response to the need to do more grinding to process the whole grains before digestion in the lower parts of the GI tract. Other studies (Banfield et al., 1999; Banfield and Forbes, 2001) have also demonstrated that the inclusion of whole wheat had no significant effect on control of coccidial infections.",

Histopathology of GI tract lesions due to acute intoxication by purified T-2 toxin is characterized by hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation of the intestinal epithelium, which occur before transient shortening of villi and reduction in the mitotic activity in crypt epithelium. Necrosis also occurs in the mucosa of the proventriculus and gizzard (Hoerr et al., 1981; Hoerr, 2003). Mycotoxins can, in combination with other factors, predispose to or exacerbate outbreaks of diseases. For example, it has been shown that ochratoxin A and coccidial infections can interact to adversely affect broiler performance (Huff and Ruff, 1982).",

Intestinal mucosal damage by coccidiosis in chickens is usually considered as one of the most important predisposing factors because coccidiosis is often seen to occur just before or concurrent with outbreaks of NE in the field (Long et al., 1974; Al-Sheikhly and Al-Saieg, 1980; Baba et al., 1992a, 1997; McDevitt et al., 2006). In turkeys, this mucosal damage is usually caused by coccidiosis, ascaridiasis, or viral hemorrhagic enteritis (Gazdzinski and Julian, 1992; Norton et al., 1992; Droual et al., 1995).",

High levels of fishmeal (Truscott and Al-Sheikhly, 1977), wheat (Branton et al., 1987; Riddell and Kong, 1992; Kaldhusdal and Skjerve, 1996; Branton et al., 1997; Annett et al., 2002), barley (Kaldhusdal and Hofshagen, 1992; Riddell and Kong, 1992; Kaldhusdal and Skjerve, 1996; Annett et al., 2002), or rye (Riddell and Kong, 1992) can exacerbate outbreaks of NE. It has been shown that inclusion of high levels of fish-meal may result in the overgrowth of C. prefringens. An increase in the concentration of particular amino acids (e.g., methionine) in the lower small intestine may be a triggering factor for the overgrowth of C. perfringens and clinical NE (Drew et al., 2004). Presence of high levels of NSP in the above-mentioned cereals can increase viscosity of digetsa and decrease digesta passage rate; increased digesta retention time facilitates bacterial colonization and activity in the small intestine (Waldenstedt et al., 2000). The increased incidence of NE due to these dietary factors might be, in part, related to an increase in clostridial proliferation (Annett et al., 2002).",

Their removal from poultry diets will likely result in changes to the microbial composition of the intestinal tract, which may in turn have consequences for commercial poultry flocks (Knarreborg et al., 2002; see review by Bedford, 2000). On the contrary, there is increasing evidence concerning economical feasibility of incorporation of antibiotics into poultry diets. A group of researchers at the Johns Hopkins University have recently investigated the economic effects of removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in commercial broiler chickens (Graham et al., 2007). This economic analysis, utilizing large-scale empirical data collected by the US broiler industry, demonstrated that the use of AGP in poultry production was associated with economic losses to producers. It was concluded that the increased weight gains that resulted from AGP are not sufficient to offset the cost of the antibiotics.",

            "text": "It is unlikely that a single economically viable replacement to AGP could be implemented (Dibner and Richards, 2005). It has become increasingly clear that a multifactorial approach is needed to address the challenges specific to the on-farm situation. An effective alternative to antibiotics should have a significant and sustainable beneficial impact on animal production (e.g., feed efficiency, body weight gain) and health, be safe for both the animal and human population, be easy to apply and store, and provide a substantial return on investment (Collett, 2004). Nonantibiotic feed additives, alone or in combination, can be effective in prevention of NE (Hofacre et al., 2003). It has also been demonstrated that treating day-old broiler chickens with normal intestinal flora from a healthy adult hen was associated with delayed intestinal proliferation of C. perfringens and reduced frequencies of NE, but regulatory restrictions make it impossible to use this approach at a farm level (Kaldhusdal et al., 2001). It has been shown, however, that complex multispecies probiotics can have beneficial effects in reducing colonization of these bacteria (Schneitz, 2005; Klose et al., 2006). Maternal immunization against NE can be another alternative measure for the control of NE in broilers (Heier et al., 2001; Lovland et al., 2004). Although the European Union has banned use of AGP in poultry diets, coccidiostats are currently used in these countries. It is suggested that phasing out of coccidiostats is not realistic because it would have significant detrimental effects on poultry health and welfare (ACAF, 2007).",
