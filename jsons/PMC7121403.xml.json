In oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types, the genes E6 (binds to p53) and E7 (binds to retinoblastoma [Rb] protein) are key players in transforming cells.HPV infection causes various diseases including warts (verruca), anogenital lesions (condylomata acuminata, intraepithelial neoplasia) and cancer, epidermodysplasia verruciformis (genodermatosis), oral and laryngeal papillomas, as well as orpharyngeal and conjunctival cancer.

            "text": "\nHerpesvirues (family Herpesviridae) are DNA viruses that may cause latent or lytic infections. Reactivation of latent viruses has been implicated in a number of diseases.A major hallmark of herpes infection is the ability to infect mainly epithelial mucosal cells and/or lymphocytes. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can infect many cells types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, neuronal cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes.There are eight types of herpesvirus that may infect humans (Table 4.2). They include the Alphaherpesviruses (HSV and Varicella-Zoster virus [VZV]), Betaherpesviruses (CMV, HHV6, HHV7), and Gammaherpesviruses (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] and KSHV). EBV and KSHV are oncogenic.\n\nHerpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) have similar characteristics. Viral infection typically results in the formation of Cowdry type A and B inclusions. Both types of HSV can infect oral (e.g., cold sores) or genital mucosa. HSV-2 is normally spread sexually, which is why genital herpes is usually the result of HSV-2 infection. Infection may also cause herpes keratitis, gladiatorum (skin lesions), visceral and CNS infection, and neonatal herpes.\nVZV typically causes chickenpox (Varicella) in childhood and shingles (Zoster) in adults, which is usually severe in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Approximately 15% of patients may develop pneumonia. Infection in utero can cause congenital varicella syndrome. The cytopathic effect of VZV infection is similar to that seen with HSV.\nEBV has a tropism for epithelial cells (e.g., oral and nasopharynx) and B lymphocytes, binding to its receptor (CD21). Primary infection may cause infectious mononucleosis. Infected B-cells activate T-cells, the cause of atypical lymphocytosis in infectious mononucleosis. Latent infection in cells is characterized by the expression of latent membrane proteins (LMP) 1 and 2, EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs), and EBV-encoded RNAs [EBERs]. EBV-associated malignancies are associated with latent gene expression (Table 4.3).\n\nCMV is the largest virus to infect humans. It produces cytomegalic cells with characteristic \u201cowl\u2019s eye\u201d nuclear inclusions. Most infections are asymptomatic. However, in immunosuppressed persons CMV can be a major problem. CMV pneumonia is the most common life-threatening complication after transplantation.\nHuman herpes virus 6 and 7 (HHV6 and HHV7) both infect T cells. They cause sixth disease typically in children, where a transient skin rash on the trunk and neck follows an episode of fever.\nKaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus/Human herpesvirus-8 (KSHV/HHV8) was the eighth herpes virus to be discovered. Most viral genes are expressed in lytic infection. The five genes expressed in latent infection are key to oncogenesis, which includes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). The immunohistochemical stain LNA-1 targets LANA within the nuclei of KSHV infected cells. KSHV has an etiologic role in Kaposi sarcoma, certain lymphomas like primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman disease.\n",

Respiratory samples may show atypical reactive pneumocytes with or without background inflammation and marked fibrin exudate in cases with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections mainly in childhood. RSV belongs to the same Paramyxoviridae family as measles (Rubeola) and mumps viruses. Both RSV and measles pneumonia can cause multinucleated syncytial giant cells containing intranuclear and inconspicuous usually paranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions. Multinucleated giant cells are usually rare, but when identified may contain up to 35 nuclei.\nAdenoviruses. They were named after being first isolated from adenoid samples. There are 55 described serotypes in humans that cause respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis, pneumonia). Infection may also cause gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, and disseminated disease. Early infected cells may display small eosinophilic inclusions. With late infection, basophilic intranuclear inclusions eventually obscure the nucleus producing a characteristic \u201csmudge cell.\u201d\n",

BKV may cause nephropathy in 1\u201310% of renal transplant patients resulting in the loss of their renal allograft. Reactivation in the kidneys and urinary tract results in shedding of infected cells, virions, and/or viral proteins in the urine.

BKV may also cause ureteral stenosis in renal transplant patients and asymptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis, usually after bone marrow transplantation.\nJC virus (JCV) may infect the respiratory tract, kidneys, or brain. CNS infection can cause fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in AIDS patients.\nMerkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV). This recently discovered virus (in 2008) causes around 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas.

For example, M. kansasii are characteristically long and broad and exhibit a cross-banded or barred appearance.Acid-fast staining of morphologically similar bacteria such as Nocardia and Legionella is a possible pitfall in the cytologic diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. Other organisms known to be acid-fast positive include micrococcus species, the oocysts of cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, and sarcocystis.Mycobacteria are grouped on the basis of their appearance and rate of growth in culture (slow, intermediate, and rapidly \u00adgrowing). According to the Runyon classification there are three slow growing groups (photochromogens that develop pigments with light exposure such as M. kansasii and M. marinum, scotochromogens which become pigmented in darkness such as M. scrofulaceum, and nonchromogens such as M. avium complex [MAC]). Rapid growers include M. chelonae and M. fortuitum.For diagnostic and treatment purposes they can be classified into three main groups:\n\nM. tuberculosis complex. This includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, M. microti, BCG and M. canetti. Infection causes tuberculosis. The response to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine in some infants and immunocomprised patients may cause postvaccinial disseminated infection presenting with lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis, and hepatic granulomas.

However, this is rare and reported to be observed in older lesions of cryptococcosis where aberrant forms are frequently seen.Infection (cryptococcosis) arises mainly in immunosuppressed patients and may cause very little inflammation.\nCryptococcus neoformans causes most infections, such as meningitis and meningoencephalitis in HIV positive patients.\nCryptococcus gattii (formerly Cryptococcus neoformans var gattii), endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Australia, may cause cryptococcosis in immunocompetent individuals (Fig. 4.11).\n",

Most illness is linked to Rhizopus spp. of the Mucorales.\nZygomycetes are fungi characterized by the formation of spores (zygospores) and a vegetative mycelium. They have broad, ribbon-like, aseptate hyaline hyphae (coenocytic hyphae) with wide-angle branching. These morphological features are helpful in differentiating the zygomycetes from other fungal agents of infection that may be seen in cytologic specimens (Table 4.5).\nIn cytology samples hyphal forms may be twisted, collapsed, or wrinkled making them hard to evaluate. Moreover, in tissue sections from biopsies or cell block material, folds and creases in the section may cause the hyphae to appear as if they have septae.In respiratory samples, the zygomycetes can be distinguished from dimorphic fungi and yeasts as they do not produce a yeast phase in this anatomic site.Samples are often associated with extensive necrosis and inflammation.Their isolation in the clinical laboratory reflects either environmental contamination or clinical disease (zygomycosis). Human zygomycosis is usually an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised hosts such as patients with diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, or using immunosuppressive therapy.Infection is associated with angioinvasive disease causing thrombosis, tissue infarction, and subsequent dissemination.Disease manifestations include rhinocerebral and pulmonary disease, and infrequently cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and allergic diseases (Fig. 4.14).\n",

Therefore, in clinical samples obtained from patients the cytologist will encounter yeasts from these organisms (Table 4.6). Several such fungal species are potential pathogens.\n\nBlastomyces. The yeasts are 8\u201315 \u03bcm in size, have a double-contour refractile wall, and demonstrate broad-based budding. The most well-known species of this genus is Blastomyces \u00addermatitidis, endemic to the United States (especially the \u00adsoutheastern, south central, and midwestern states) and Canada. Infection (blastomycosis) occurs by inhalation of the fungus from its natural soil habitat. Infection may involve virtually any organ including the lungs, skin, bones, and brain (Fig. 4.15).\nCoccidioides. This fungus presents with endospores contained within thick-walled spherules that vary in size (20\u2013150 \u03bcm). Endospores measuring 3\u20135 \u03bcm may be seen scattered singly if the spherule ruptures. When free endospores occur within macrophages, they can imitate other intracellular yeasts. The causative agents of infection (coccidioidomycosis) are C. immitis and C. posadasii. These fungi are endemic in American deserts. Infection causes granulomatous and miliary disease affecting largely the lungs. In endemic regions, fungus balls may develop within lung cavities.\nParacoccidioides. These yeasts measure 5\u201330 \u03bcm in size and are round to oval. Budding is characterized by a central yeast with multiple surrounding daughter buds, that morphologically resembles a \u201cship\u2019s wheel.\u201d Infection (paracoccidioidomycosis) is caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, typically found in Brazil and elsewhere in South America. Primary infection (Valley Fever) is usually mild and self-limiting, but may progress into a systemic mycosis producing oral lesions, generalized lymphadenopathy, and miliary pulmonary lesions. Infection can also spread to bones, meninges, and the spleen.\nHistoplasma. This budding yeast is round to oval, on average 1\u20135 \u03bcm in size and observed mainly within macrophages (Fig. 4.16), but sometimes also within neutrophils. Narrow based round to oval budding may be noted, but because of their small size buds are often not seen. Intracellular yeasts are usually surrounded by a clear zone (halo). However, with cell disruption organisms may be spilled extracellularly. This fungus is usually found in bird and bat (guano) fecal material. There are a few \u00adspecies including H. capsulatum. H. capsulatum var. capsulatum are smaller (1\u20135 \u03bcm) than H. capsulatum var. duboisii which have larger sized budding yeast cells (5\u201312 \u03bcm). Although this fungus occurs worldwide, it is prevalent in certain regions (Ohio and Mississippi river valleys) of North America and in caves of southern and East Africa. Infection causes histoplasmosis which primarily affects the lungs and mediastinum, but may become \u00addisseminated presenting with hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, ocular and skin disease, as well as enlarged adrenal glands.\nSporothrix. Yeasts measure 3\u20135 \u03bcm in diameter, are round to cigar-shaped, and can show single or multiple buds. Rarely aseptate hyphae may be observed. The only active species is Sporothrix schenckii, which is the causative agent of sporotrichosis (rose-handler\u2019s disease). Initial cutaneous infections may spread via lymphatics and disseminate to joints, bones, and the central nervous system. Inhaled fungi can cause pulmonary sporotrichosis with lung nodules, cavities, fibrosis, and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nPenicillium. These fungi produce penicillin. Penicillium marneffei is the only known thermally dimorphic species. In cytology specimens, Penicillium present in the mold phase with septate and branched hyphae represent a contaminant. However, in immunosuppressed patients P. marneffei is an opportunistic infection that causes penicilliosis. There is a particularly high incidence of penicilliosis in AIDS patients from tropical Southeast Asia. Infection after inhalation spreads from the lungs to involve the hematopoietic system and skin. Yeast-like cells are present within macrophages and extracellularly. They are not true yeast cells, but rather arthroconidia. Intracellular \u201cyeasts\u201d measure 2\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter and are round to oval. Because they divide by binary fission, budding is not observed. The extracellular organisms tend to be more elongated, sometimes up to 13 \u03bcm, and can have \u201cseptae\u201d (crosswalls from binary fission).\n",

They are traditionally divided according to their means of locomotion such as amebae, flagellates, and ciliates.Their life cycle often alternates between trophozoites (feeding\u2013dividing stage) and cysts (dormant stage able to survive outside the host). Their characteristics (particularly the nuclei and cytoplasmic inclusions) help in species identification. Ingested cysts cause infection by excysting (releasing trophozoites) in the alimentary tract.\nAmebae (Sarcodina) pathogenic to humans include intestinal and free-living amebae.\n\nIntestinal amebae. Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis that may manifest with dysentery, flask-shaped colon ulcers, a colonic ameboma, and possible extraintestinal abscesses that contain anchovy paste-like material within the liver, and infrequently spleen or brain. Several of the amebae such as Entamoeba dispar are harmless and some may be relatively common, such as Entamoeba gingivalis that is usually found in the mouth. Unlike other amebae, the cytoplasm of pathogenic E. histolytica contains ingested red blood cells.\nFree-living amebae. These include Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Naegleria fowleri. Acanthamoeba cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), contact lens-associated Acanthamoeba keratitis, and skin lesions. Balamuthia also causes GAE. N. fowleri (\u201cbrain-eating\u201d ameba) is associated with rapidly fatal primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), most often seen in children swimming in fresh water ponds and rivers during which amebae enter the nasal passages and migrate to the brain via the olfactory nerve. These trophozoites can be seen in CSF specimens, but culture on nonnutrient agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli and/or a flagellation test is required for confirmation.\n\nFlagellates (Mastigophora) are organisms that have one or more flagella.\n\nGiardia. There are approximately 40 species described, but the species that infects humans is Giardia lamblia (also called G. intestinalis or G. duodenalis). This parasite is the most common cause of protozoal gastroenteritis (giardiasis). Trophozoites (9\u201321 \u03bcm long and 5\u201315 \u03bcm wide) are kite (or pear)-shaped and have two nuclei, four pairs of flagella, and two central axonemes running down their middle. Their cysts (8\u201314  \u00d7  7\u201310 \u03bcm) seen in stool specimens are oval, thick walled, and contain four nuclei and multiple curved median bodies.\nTrichomonas. There are several trichomonad species such as the intestinal Pentatrichomonas hominis which is a nonpathogenic organism. Trichomonas vaginalis is the anaerobic, flagellated protozoan that causes trichomoniasis (Fig. 4.18). Details of this sexually transmitted infection are covered in 10.1007/978-1-4614-0242-8_5. Apart from urogenital infections, T. vaginalis has also been reported to cause pneumonia, bronchitis, and oral lesions. Pulmonary trichomoniasis is usually caused by aspirated Trichomonas tenax (mouth commensal) and less often T. vaginalis infection. An association between flagellated protozoa and asthma has been reported.\nLeishmania. These parasites are acquired from the sandfly. Depending on the species, they may cause cutaneous (e.g., oriental sore), mucocutaneous (espundia or uta), or visceral (kala-azar) leishmaniasis (Table 4.7). There are two morphological forms: promastigote (with a flagellum) found in the insect host and an amastigote (without flagella) present in the human host (Fig. 4.19). Diagnostic samples may be procured from skin lesions (cutaneous or mucocutaneous) or bone marrow aspirates (visceral). The morphologic hallmark is the presence of multiple small (2\u20135 \u03bcm) intracellular amastigotes within macrophages (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Amastigotes are spherical to ovoid in shape and have both a nucleus and ovoid or rod-shaped kinetoplast. The differential diagnosis for multiple small organisms within histiocytes includes H. capsulatum (with budding and only intracellular) and toxoplasmosis (more curved and mostly extracellular).\n\n\nTrypanosoma. The major human diseases caused by trypanosomatids are African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) caused by Trypanosoma brucei and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) caused by T. cruzi. Trypomastigotes (30 \u03bcm in length) are usually found in peripheral blood. They have an undulating membrane, central nucleus, and kinetoplast at the anterior end.\n\nCiliates (Ciliophora) include the parasitic species Balantidium coli, the only member of this phylum known to be pathogenic to humans. The trophozoite is relatively large (50\u201370 \u03bcm), has a ciliated surface, and contains a kidney bean-shaped macronucleolus. The cyst form may occasionally also have cilia. Cilicytophthoria may be sometimes mistaken for these ciliated organisms.\n",

Malaria and babesiosis are not discussed further because the diagnosis and speciation of these organisms primarily requires examination of peripheral blood smears and monoclonal antibody tests.Coccidian diseases include cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium spp.), isosporiasis (I. belli), cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora cayetanensis), sarcocystis, and toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii). The microsporidia, at one time a separate group (not coccidian), are now classified with the fungi.\nCryptosporidium spp. C. parvum is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals, a major cause of protracted diarrhea in patients with AIDS. Other species that cause human disease include C. hominis. These small (8\u201315 \u03bcm) oval parasites are identified within the brush border of the intestinal epithelium, and are discussed in the chapter on gastrointestinal infections. Ultrastructural studies have shown them to be intracellular but with an extracytoplasmic localization in enterocytes. Modified acid-fast thick-walled oocysts (4\u20136 \u03bcm) may be detected in stool samples. Cryptosporidium can disseminate beyond the intestine, especially in patients with AIDS, to involve the biliary tract, stomach, lungs, middle ear, and pancreas.\nMicrosporidia include Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis (previously Septata intestinalis). Although these organisms are now considered fungi, parasitologists still maintain them in most books. In cytology specimens obtained from the small intestine, microsporidia appear as numerous small intracellular organisms within the apical portion of enterocytes. They stain well with Gram and silver stains (e.g., Warthin-Starry). Their spores (1\u20131.5 \u03bcm) may be found with a modified trichrome stain in stool samples as well as urine.\nI. belli and Sarcocystis infections very rarely have trophozoites that are detected. Their oocysts, however, may be seen when excreted in feces.\nT. gondii belongs to the genus Toxoplasma. Although infection can be acquired from the accidental ingestion of \u00adinfective oocysts from cat feces (definitive host), most infections are acquired from eating infected rare or raw meats. Disease ranges from mild flu-like illness to fatal fetal infections. Latent infection may reactivate in immunosuppressed patients. Organisms may be found in samples from the brain, heart, eye, hematopoietic system, and lungs. Specimens may contain free (extracellular) tachyzoites which are small (3\u20135 \u03bcm), curved (banana-shaped) forms (Fig. 4.20).

            "text": "\nHelminths (parasitic worms) are categorized into three groups: cestodes (tapeworms), nematodes (roundworms), and trematodes (flukes) (Table 4.8). Flukes and tapeworms belong to the phylum platyhelminthes (flatworms).\nClinical infection may be caused by adult worms, larvae, and/or eggs (Fig. 4.21). Infections are usually diagnosed by the characteristics of these different developmental stages.The host response to these parasites includes eosinophilia, acute inflammation, and sometimes granulomas.\nCestodes. These tapeworms usually parasitize humans after eating underprepared meat such as pork (Taenia solium), beef (Taenia saginata), or fish (Diphyllobothrium spp.), or food that is prepared in conditions of poor hygiene (e.g., Echinococcus spp.).\n\nTaenia. Infection with the adult tapeworms occurs following ingestion of cysticerci in rare or poorly cooked beef or pork. T. saginata (beef) infection results in small intestinal infestation of adult worms (taeniasis). T. solium (pork) infection can also cause cysticercosis, as a result of the accidental ingestion of food or drink contaminated with tapeworm eggs from the feces. Cysticercosis is characterized by cysts containing larvae located in several sites such as the brain (neurocysticercosis causes seizures), eye, as well as muscles and subcutaneous tissue (causes painful nodules). These cysts may cause eosinophilia, an inflammatory reaction and eventually they may calcify.\nEchinococcus. Infection from the accidental ingestion of food or drink contaminated with tapeworm eggs results in hydatid disease, also known as echinococcosis. The larval cysts that develop can be found in virtually any site, grow slowly, and persist for many years until they cause symptoms or are discovered incidentally. Disruption of a cyst containing highly antigenic fluid may result in anaphylactic shock, and for this reason it has been recommended that they should not be biopsied. However, on the basis of published data adverse reactions are rare. Use of a fine gauge needle by a skilled operator is important to prevent fluid leakage during aspiration. There are three different forms of echinococcosis: cystic (unilocular) echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus granulosus), alveolar (multilocular) echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus multilocularis), and polycystic echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus vogeli and rarely Echinococcus oligarthus). A hydatid cyst contains a thick outer (acellular) wall and thin inner germinal epithelium. Alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis cysts usually have multiple compartments. Hydatid cysts may contain several liters of fluid, daughter cysts, and hydatid sand (Fig. 4.22). Aspirated hydatid sand contains protoscolices (future scolices) and free hooklets. Viable protoscolices typically show a row of parallel hooklets whereas dead ones contain haphazardly attached hooklets.\n\n\nNematodes. There are several roundworms (Table 4.7), but those likely to be seen in cytology specimens are Enterobius vermicularis, Strongyloides stercoralis, and the microfilariae.\n\nE. vermicularis (pinworm, also known as the threadworm in the United Kingdom) causes intestinal infestation (enterobiasis). The adult female worm migrates out onto the perianal area at night, and once exposed to oxygen she lays her eggs. This causes perianal pruritis and possibly vaginitis. Occasionally subcutaneous perineal nodules may develop. In such cases, Pap tests may contain an adult worm and/or eggs. The worm has a characteristic pointed tail (Fig. 4.23). Their eggs are colorless, oval, thin walled, and flattened on one side,\n\nS. stercoralis. This worm causes strongyloidiasis. After penetrating the skin, infective larvae pass through the lung (Loeffler syndrome). They are then coughed or swallowed and infest the duodenum. Here new autoinfective larvae may develop (autoinfection) leading to chronic infection. In immunocompromised patients, larvae may penetrate the intestinal wall and \u00addisseminate via the bloodstream (called hyperinfection). Disseminated strongyloidiasis has a very high mortality rate. Cytology specimens including gastrointestinal and pulmonary (e.g., sputum) samples may contain larvae, either rhabditiform (noninfective) or filariform (infective) types.\nFilariae. These roundworms cause filariasis. Microfilariae that may be periodically found in the peripheral blood include Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Loa loa. W. bancrofti and B. malayi infest lymphatics leading to lymphadentitis and chronic lymphedema (elephantiasis). L. loa resides in subcutaneous tissue and the conjunctiva. Certain microfilariae such as Mansonella perstans, Onchocerca volvulus, Dracunculus medinensis, and Dirofilaria immitis are not readily found in blood smears. M. perstans inhabits body cavities such as the peritoneum and pleura (serous cavity filariasis). O. volvulus infects subcutaneous tissue forming nodules and the conjunctivae causing blindness (onchocerciasis or river blindness). D. immitis (dog heartworm) causes granulomatous nodules in the lung. Microfilariae are the diagnostic forms of infection. The presence or absence of a sheath and the pattern of nuclei in their tail are the main features used to distinguish the various species. Occult filariasis has been diagnosed by many bloody FNA procedures containing microfilariae, worms, or even eggs. Filarial morphology is best appreciated with a Giemsa stain. The background tissue response in cytology aspirates may include eosinophils, neutrophils, chronic inflammation, and even granulomas.\n\nTrematodes. The flukes are oval or worm-like helminthes that are parasites of molluscs and vertebrates. The liver flukes include Fasciola hepatica and Clonorchis sinensis that result in infestation of the bile ducts and subsequent biliary fibrosis. Infection with C. sinensis is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. Fasciolopis buskii is an intestinal fluke that infests both the bile ducts and duodenum. Paragonimus westermani, the lung fluke, causes lung infestation with pulmonitis. Also included are the schistosomes (blood flukes).\n\nSchistosomes. Infection by these trematodes causes schistosomiasis (bilharzia). There are three human schistosome pathogens: Schistosoma mansoni from Africa (Nile delta) which causes intestinal schistosomiasis, S. haematobium from Africa and the Middle East that infests the urinary bladder, and S. japonicum from China and Southeast Asia that primarily involves the liver. S. haematobium infection can lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. Microscopic identification of eggs in stool or urine specimens, as well as tissue biopsies, can provide a rapid diagnosis. The spines present on schistosome eggs help distinguish these different species. The egg of S. haematobium (oval) has a terminal spine, S. mansoni (oval) has a lateral spine, and S. japonicum (round) has a small knob-like lateral spine.\n\n",
