We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks). Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate. Results: Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens. Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios. In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable. In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk.",

Radiation oncology departments have therefore quickly developed and implemented protocols to minimize risks of COVID-19 to patients. 4, 5 While the use of the shortest possible course of radiation for patients has been advocated by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, 6 abbreviated courses of treatment may require trade-offs in cancer-control or toxicity compared to standard courses. In this study we develop a quantitative framework for incorporating COVID-19 associated risk to characterize the effects of this trade-off on patient outcomes and applied this framework to elderly patients with glioblastoma (GBM).",

We then simulated the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. We first simulated Nd in this group by drawing from a binomial distribution with M a n u s c r i p t 8 n = c and death rate p = d, and selected Nd individuals randomly from the pool of infected patients. These Nd individuals had their survival time adjusted as follows: We assumed a ~ 4week period between diagnosis and start of radiation, and added the number of fractions on treatment until infection (based on the simulations above). We added a 5-day incubation period, and simulated time from symptom onset to death as a gamma random variable with mean 18 days and shape parameter 1.0. These estimates are based on published reports of a five-day incubation period 21 ",

The predominant model for RT delivery in Europe and North America involves daily outpatient visits to a community or academic cancer center, but there is variation globally.

This pattern persists when we examine outcomes stratified by MGMT methylation status in the Nordic and CCTG/EORTC trials (Table 3) . Thus, with the exception of situations where the risk of COVID-19 is felt to be very high (mortality risk >20% with daily infection risk of >5%), hypofractionated radiation over 3 weeks with TMZ is an excellent option for elderly GBM patients with good performance status. The combination of TMZ with more hypofractionated radiation regimens (25Gy in 5 fractions or 34Gy in 10 fractions) is appealing but has not been evaluated in a prospective clinical trial.",

In high pandemic risk settings, our results suggest that TMZ alone may be an option for frail elderly MGMT methylated patients who are suitable for single modality treatment, but this modality requires further evaluation before widespread use given the immunosuppressive effects of TMZ. In MGMT unmethylated frail patients, our results suggest that a hypofractionated course of radiation can be used and should be recommended. Both 10-fraction and 15-fraction radiation alone regimens have been evaluated in randomized trials, but there is no prospective comparison of these two regimens. In higher risk pandemic settings, 34 Gy in 10 fractions is an appealing option to minimize visits required by patients. We were not able to analyze the International Atomic Energy Agency trial that evaluated a 5 fraction regimen for newly diagnosed GBM patients, 16 which delivers a lower biologic effective dose but could be an option in the setting of high risk and resource strain. In unmethylated MGMT patients, caution would be necessary in considering omission of RT in favor of TMZ, as TMZ can be immunosuppressive and has an unclear benefit in these patients.",

Early data does suggest an elevated risk of adverse events or death among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to the general population. 31 Reported toxicity data from published trials can provide estimates of risks associated with TMZ use. In the Nordic trial, a 12% rate of neutropenia and 19% rate of infection/fever was reported with TMZ versus 0% neutropenia and 7% infection/fever rate with hypofractionated RT. 11 In the CCTG/EORTC trial, rate of grade 3+ lymphopenia was 27.2% with short-course chemoradiation versus 10.3% with short course radiation alone. 12 It remains unclear how these reported hematologic toxicity rates translate to infection risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. As additional data becomes available, TMZassociated risk could be incorporated into a quantitative framework, and it may disproportionately affect chemoradiation regimens that include the risk of both exposure from daily radiation visits and increased susceptibility due to TMZ-associated immunosuppression.",
