Because most enveloped viruses require 26 glycosylation for surface protein folding and secretion, modulation of the oligosaccharide 27 to induce a reduction in infectivity became a strategy for treatment of the immune 28 deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), culminating in phase I/II clinical trials (8, 9) . The use of 29 iminosugars to misfold viral glycoprotein as a therapeutic approach has so far been 30 applied to several other viral infections including: hepatitis B and C viruses, Dengue and 31 other flaviviruses, and Ebola virus (10-12). An additional property of certain iminosugars is 32 the Glucosyltransferase inhibition activity, which is the basis for current therapy of rare 33 genetic lysosome storage diseases such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C (13).

After removal of the 3 inoculum and wash in PBS, the cells were overlaid with medium containing 1.5% CMC and 4 dilutions of drug as indicated in Figure 1A . 72 hours post-infection cells were fixed and 5 stained to reveal plaques, which were visually counted. Data are from three independent 6 experiments each in duplicate biological replicates. In parallel, cytotoxicity was assessed 7 by the Alamar blue method at the indicated dilutions of drug. The effective concentration 8 for 50% inhibition (EC 50 ) of Miglustat was 41\u00b122 \u00b5M with no apparent cyototoxicity until 1 9 mM (CC 50 > 1 mM). The plaque assay was performed in Vero E6 cells, which are standard 10 for the growth of SARS-CoV-2. However, further analysis would be better performed in 11 cells of human origin. To better characterize this hypothesis, a time-of-addition (TOA) experiment was 1 performed. Different conditions were used: pre-treatment, co-treatment and post-2 treatment. Huh7 cells were pre-treated with 200 \u00b5M Miglustat for 3h and then infected for 3 1h in the absence of drug (moi = 0.1). Afterwards, the virus was removed and the cells 4",

Host directed antiviral therapy is a strategy of inhibiting virus infection by targeting host 2 factors that are essential for viral replication (23). Currently there is a pressing need for 3 antiviral drugs for immediate use in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Miglustat is a 4 drug that is in current clinical use for the treatment of certain genetic disorders and has 5 shown to be active against a variety of viral infections, making it a suitable candidate for 6 drug repurposing towards SARS-CoV-2. In this work the activity of Miglustat against 7 SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in vitro with EC 50 in the micromolar range.

Correct folding and secretion of glycoproteins 22 is a process tightly controlled in the ER by chaperons such as Calnexin that recognize 23 specific glycosylation intermediates (25). Miglustat interferes with this process resulting in 24 the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a defect in secretion. Consistently, the Spike 25 protein of SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to bind Calnexin and disruption of this function 26 caused decrease of virus infectivity (22). 27",

Furthermore, in order to stain infected cells a protocol for 20 immunofluorescence was established. To this end, a recombinant monoclonal based on 21 SIP mouse scaffold (mSIP-3022) was generated carrying the CDR regions of the antibody 22 CR3022 reactive against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein of SARS-23CoV-1, which showed high binding affinity also for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein(17). As 24 shown in Supplementary Figure S1B, mSIP-3022 efficiently stains the Spike protein in the 25 cytoplasm of infected Vero E6 and Huh7 cells 24 hours post-infection. 26 27 Next, the efficiency of Huh7 infection was assessed in the presence of Miglustat. As 28 shown in Figure 1B and quantified in Figure 1C, Miglustat maintained the number of Huh7 29 infected cells at the level observed 24 hpi, while mock treated cells showed an increase of 30 infected cells at 48 hpi as expected form an expansion of the infection in the cell culture. 31 These data confirm the inhibitory effect of Miglustat in cells of human origin and might 32 suggest that the activity of Miglustat is at the level of the secretion of new infectious virus 33 and not at the entry/replication level. 34 35",

Spike and its receptor-binding domain are heavily 18 glycosylated and undergo folding and glycosylation through the ER before being secreted 19 and exposed on the plasma membrane. Previous data on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-20 1 indicated that both glycosylation and secretion were affected by Miglustat (21, 22). 21 Therefore we took advantage of an expression vector for SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD to 22 assess the effect of Miglustat treatment on protein release from transfected 293T cells. As 23 shown in figure 2H, the protein is highly abundant in the cell supernatant in normal 24 conditions, but, upon treatment with 200 \u00b5M Miglustat, the protein was much less 25 abundant. These data point to a role of Miglustat as an inhibitor of the proper folding and 26 release of functional Spike protein. To reinforce this observation, full-length spike was 27 transfected in 293T cells and the fully folded protein expressed on the cell surface 28",
