            "text": "Enterovirus 71 was first detected in 1969 in California and isolated from a child's feces suffering from encephalitis. 4 Enterovirus 71 infection is usually seen as children exanthema, yet it can cause neurologic diseases such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and flaccid paralysis. 5 EV71 is divided to three subgenotypes including group A containing prototype strain BrCr, group B, and group C with each categorized as B1 to B5 and C1 to C5 subgroup responsible for several outbreaks in southeast Asia, Europe, and Australia. 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] These viruses have a positive sense single-stranded RNA with an approximate length of 7400 nucleotides, consisting of four structural viral proteins 1 to 4 (VP1-VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D). 13, 14 This genome has one large open reading frame (ORF) which translates to a large polyprotein and flanks with an untranslated region (UTR) on the 5\u2032 side (750 nucleotide) and another untranslated region on the 3\u2032 side (75-100 nucleotide). 15 HFMD is mostly a mild and self-limiting disease, but it can progress to create serious neurologic diseases specially in acute infection, which in rare cases can be seen in coxsakievirus A16. 5, 16 Yet, there is not any vaccine or drug for HFMD. 17 The infection cycle of enteroviruses consists of different stages: After entering the cell and uncoating, positive sense single-stranded RNA, which has one ORF, acts as an mRNA and translates to one large polyprotein, which will be processed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). RNA synthesis occurs in the replication complex on the outer surface of membrane vesicles which have been induced by virus. 18 The new synthesis RNA, which is released from the replication complex, may enter another round of translation and replication or package through capsid proteins to produce progeny virus. Initiation of new genome strand polymerization depends on RDRP position. In this regard, for negative strand synthesis, RDRP should be close to 3\u2032 end of the positive strand, and for positive strand synthesis, RDRP should be close to 3\u2032 end of the negative strand. Because of difference in 3\u2032 end in complement strands, the replication machine recognizes two different origins of replication for initiation of positive and negative strand synthesis called OriL and OriR, respectively. 1 Numerous studies have indicated that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR of enteroviruses have an important effect on tissue tropism and pathogenesis. 19, 20 Some studies indicate that VP1 BC loop of EV71 (L97R) has an important role in viral tropism. 21 After EV71 infection, different organs are attacked by the virus causing gastrointestinal, cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic disease.",

            "text": "Interferon family is divided into three class of cytokines, including types I, II, and III, among which type I is expressed in nearly all mammalian cells, 25 which consists of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c9, \u0511, and \u043a. On the other hand, only one type has been observed in the IFN II family called IFN-\u03b3 which has an immunomodulatory effect on the immune system and antiviral activity. This kind of interferon is produced only by activating T cells or NK cells. 25 Type III interferon has three subtypes including \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03bb3 which are induced by viral infection and show antiviral activities. 26 Among these molecules, IFN \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two cytokines with a major activity in the innate immune system against viral infection. 27 After a viral infection, IFN response is induced in two stages: IFN production pathway is induced followed by IFN signaling pathway After recognition of dsRNA by TLR in the endosome, toll interlukin-1 receptor (TIR) is recruited, causing activation of another adaptor called TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF). TRIF with another protein called TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) leads to activation of two IKK-related kinases including TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and \"I kappa B kinase I\" (IKKi). These two adaptors mediate phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) and induce IFN type I expression. [32] [33] [34] [35] Viral ssRNA in endosomes is recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 and recruiting other adaptors such as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) and TRAF6, 36 resulting in the activation of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) kinase followed by phosphorylation of IRF7, where IRF7 transports to the nucleus and induces IFN type I expression. 37 Meanwhile, there are other alternative mechanisms for cytosolic nucleic acids. Two RNA helicase RIG1 and MDA5 recognize viral RNA in the cytoplasm, after which IFN promoter-stimulating factor 1 (IPS1, Cardif, MAVS, or VISA) is recruited. Then, the interaction between IPS1, TRAF3, and TBK1/IKKi leads to activation of IRF3/IRF7 and induction of IFN type I expression. 38 The IFN production pathway has been demonstrated in Figure 1 Finally, these cleavages lead to production of 11 structural and nonstructural proteins including VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. 45 2A and 3C are cysteine proteases, belonging to the chymotrypsin-related endopeptidase protease family. 46 The protein sequence alignments of 2A and 3C show only~20% similarity, but they have similar tertiary structures. Different enterovirus genotypes have shown approximately 50% to 75% sequence similarity in 2A and 3C. The tertiary structures of 2Apro reveals a six-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet barrel and a \u03b2-sheet pile packed on its side. 3Cpro has a tertiary structure consisting of the twisted \u00df-barrels packed perpendicular to each other. These domains help to create a catalytic site, which consists of histidine, aspartic acid, and cysteine in 2Apro, as well as histidine, glutamic acid, and cysteine in 3Cpro. 3C protease can attach to RNA thanks to the cysteine in the catalytic site which has nucleophile features. 46, 47 The amino acid compositions P4, P2, P1, P1\u2032, and P2\u2032 are important for specific protease cleavage. 46, 48 For 2A protease, the P1\u2032 position is very important, which is mostly glycine. After P1\u2032, P2 position is very important which is usually recognized by threonine and asparagine. It is followed by P2\u2032 which can be proline, alanine, and phenylalanine, and P4, which is mostly a position for leucine or threonine. For 3C pro , P1 and P1\u2032 positions indicate the highest conservation in the substrate sequence. The current amino acid in these positions is glutamine or glutamate for P1, as well as glycine, asparagine, or serine for P1\u2032. In addition, the most common amino acid in positions P4 and P2\u2032 is alanin and prolin, respectively. In both 2Apro and 3Cpro, the glycine amino acid in position P1\u2032 is highly conserved, but 3C is mostly identified by cleavage in the Gln/Gly amino acid pair. 48, 49 3Cpro has been considered as a good target for antiviral drugs as the enteroviral polyprotein has several cleavage sites specifically for this protease, and it has a vital role in virus maturation. Many of the inhibitors are small molecules occupying the active site of the proteases. 50 One example is pyrazole compounds which inhibit 3Cpro from different enteroviruses and coronavirus protease which is similar to 3Cpro. 51 Another example is microcyclic inhibitors against enterovirus 3Cpro, norovirus, and SARS-coronavirus protease. 52 To date, rupintrivir (AG7088) and AG7404 as its analog have entered clinical trials. [53] [54] [55] Recently, researchers have been mostly focusing on rupintrivir as it proved to be potentially effective against EV71, CAV16, and EV68. [56] [57] [58] [59] FIGURE 1 IFN production pathway and different ways that the virus disrupts this pathway. Downregulation: long line with a small line at the end; scissor shape: cleavage by protease; IF production pathway activation was indicated in two ways. Left: Activation of pathway was indicated when ssRNA or dsRNA are in the cytoplasm, in which case two adaptors (RIG1 and MDA5) recognize them, resulting in activation of IPS1 (MAVS, VISA, or cardif). IPS activates two other adaptors (IKK and TBK1) leading to phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7. Translocation of these adaptors to the nucleus causes ISRE promoter activation and IFN production. 2A protease has inhibitory effects in this pathway with cleavage of MDA5 and IPS1, but 3C protease downregulates RIG1 through interaction. Right: Activation of pathway is observed when ssRNA or dsRNA are in the endosome. In this situation, TLR3 and TLR7/8 are responsible for RNA recognition, resulting in the activation of two adaptors (TRIF and MYD88). TRIF activates other adaptors such as TRAF3, IKK, and TBK1 giving rise to the activation of IRF7 and IRF3, where translocation of these proteins to the nucleus causes IFN production. MYD88 also activates some other adaptors including IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6 leading to phosphorylation and activation of IRF7 and translocation to the nucleus. As can be seen, 3C protease affects this pathway by cleaving IRF7 and preventing its translocation to the nucleus 4 | VIRAL PROTEASES AGAINST CELLULAR PROTEINS Type I interferon is a common cytokine expressed in response to viral infections. This cytokine is the first defense line against viral infections in cells. 60 On the other hand, several viruses including influenza A, hepatitis C, dengue virus, and respiratory syncytial virus have different strategies against the host defense system resulting in infection. 61 [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] where with cleavage of this transcriptional protein, DNA-dependent transcription is impaired. 72 It was reported that 3C can enter the nucleus through its precursor 3CD which contains nuclear localization site. 73, 74 Hence, it can target the nuclear called named CstF-64, an essential factor for polyadenylation of mRNA in the nucleus, which is crucial in the maturation of mRNA. 75 Further, 3C of EV71 can cause apoptosis in epithelial, neuronal, and lymphocyte cells 10,76-78 and can interact with PIN2/TERF1-interacting telomerase inhibitor 1 (Pinx-1) which is an inhibitor of telomerase and tumor suppressor factor and induces apoptosis. 79 EV71 infection can prompt degradation of Trim 38 and also induce autophagy in host cells.",

Firstly, they suppress IFN production through inactivation of the transcription factor by target adaptors such as IRF3/IRF7, nuclear factor kappa-lightchain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) or ATF-2/C-Jun. Secondly, they suppress IFN signaling pathway activation and ISGs activation by blocking JAK-STAT signaling pathway. 84 38 Probably, 3C attaches to RIG1 and locks this protein in inactive form or interact with CARD region and inhibit RIG1-IPS1 interaction. 38 Chen et al also reported that EV71 infection causes ubiquitination inhibition of RIG1, resulting in induction of IFN and ISG expression. 89 Some studies have report that 3C can degrade RIG1 by its protease activity, 87,88 but others have not confirmed it. 38 EV71 3C can overcome IFN production through cleavage of IRF7 in TLR3 pathway. This cleavage is not sensitive to caspases, proteases, endocytosis, and autophagy, but sensitive to 3C inhibitors. Also, IRF7 has a cleavage site for 3C. These pieces of evidence approve the role of 3C in IRF7 cleavage. 37 A study has reported 3C cleave adaptor TRIF as a key factor in the IFN signaling pathway in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell but not in HT-29 cell. 27 This study demonstrates that the cell type has an important role in protein-protein interactions between the virus and host. 2A pro can also target mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and inhibit IFN production in Hela cells. 90 It can also cleave MDA5 which suppresses activation of IRF3. 90, 91 It was reported that MDA5, which is responsible for recognizing picornaviral RNA, degraded during polivirus infection 86 94 Experiments suggest that this fall in IFNR1 level is related to protease activity of 2A, since by creating a mutation in cys110 and changing it to Ala110 at the catalytic site, this process will be inactivated. 94 Some viruses inhibit activation of the Jak-stat pathway by suppressing phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Also, EV71 decreases the phosphorylation level of STAT1 and STAT2 during 12 hours after infection. 95 Liu et al indicated that infection by EV71 also blocks JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation, yet this report did not prove changes in IFNR expression level. 95 This study suggests that 2A and 3C protease do not have an important role in the inhibition of STAT phosphorylation. Possibly, interaction of two or more viral proteins inhibits IFN signaling pathway. Furthermore, EV71 could downregulate JAK1 by inhibiting nucleocytoplasmic translocation or translation of its mRNA or by other independent proteases or via lysosomal outophagy. The reason is that JAK1 mRNA does not show a reduction after EV71 infection, but its protein is reduced. 95 3C protease of EV71 can also suppress IFN signaling pathway through cleavage of IRF9 and inhibiting IFN signaling cascade. 96 it. 100,101 VP24 has been recognized as a receptor site for nuclear localization signal on KPNA, which is crucial for translocation of P-STAT1 into the nucleus, with VP24 competing with P-STAT1 for attachment to KPNA. 102 Other viruses such as SARS Cov and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) also interact with KPNA and suppress its function. 103, 104 Interestingly, KPNA degradation was seen in RD, Hela, and Vero cells, but not in human gastrointestinal epithelial cells. 97 7 | SUMMARY Enterovirus 71 is a major cause of HFMD and is an important concern following polio eradication, as it can cause flaccid paralysis. EV71 outbreak has been reported from different countries especially in Asia. 38 As with other viruses, EV71 has some weapons to fight against the and TRIF thus causing inhibition of IFN production. This cleavage FIGURE 2 IFN signaling pathway and different ways that the virus interferes with this pathway. Downregulation: the long line with a small line at the end; inhibition of phosphorylation: the long line with a black circle at the end; scissor shape: cleavage by protease; EV71: enterovirus 71 infection. Attachment of IFN type 1 to IFNR1 and IFNR2 results in phosphorylation and activation of two adaptors called JNK1 and TYK2. The phosphorylation of these two proteins causes activation of STAT1 and STAT2 adaptors which form a complex with IRF9 and KPNA1, with the complex being called ISGF3. As can be seen in this image, STAT1 has a residue (a nuclear localization signal) which is recognized by KPNA1. This attachment induces translocation of ISGF3 to the nucleus and induces ISG's promoter. 2A protease can suppress the pathway by interacting with IFNR1, and 3C protease can cleave IRF9 and inhibit formation of ISGF3. EV71 infection can also inhibit phosphorylation of JNK1, TYK2, STAT1, and STAT2 which has been suggested in some studies. One of the latest reports found new mechanisms through which EV71 infection causes downregulation of KPNA1 in a caspase 3-dependent manner and inhibits translocation of ISGF3 to nucleus happens at Q189-S190 and Q312-S313 positions, respectively. 37, 105 2A protease can also target MAVS and MDA5 and degrade them in Hella cells, culminating in inhibition of IFN production. 27 Nevertheless, some studies have reported that a number of enteroviruses including HRV1A cleave MAVS in a caspase-dependent manner. 90 As a second strategy, EV71 acts against the host innate immune system by affecting IFN signaling pathway. Lu et al reported that 2A protease causes decrement in IFNR1 level and suppresses IFN signaling pathway 6 hours following infection. 94 Nevertheless, Liu et al indicated that there is no change in the level of IFNR after EV71 infection. They also found that EV71 infection blocks JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation through downregulation of JAK1. There was no change in JAK1 mRNA levels, but reduction in the protein level was observable. 95 This study hypothesized that possibly the interaction of two or more viral proteins is responsible for that not only 2A or 3C. 3C protease of EV71 is also responsible for cleavage of IRF9, an important adaptor in the IFN signaling pathway which inhibits activation of ISRE promoter. 96 However, Wang et al suggested a new mechanism for the IFN signaling pathway suppression and rejected all of the previous mechanisms. This study suggests that EV71 does not suppress phosphorylation of STAT1 or downregulate IFNR1 and JAK1 significantly, but inhibit its translocation to the nucleus by disrupting the interaction between P-STAT1 and KPNA1 through degradation of KPNA1. 44 As mentioned earlier, IFN production happened in the HT-29 cell rather than occurring in other cells such as RD and Hella, which is in accordance with the fact that the IFN signaling pathway is active in gastric epithelial cells despite EV71 infection. Possibly, due to this event, patients do not have gastric signs or at least have mild signs. Wang et al revealed that KPNA1 degradation does not happen in gastric epithelial cells. This study proves that neither 2A nor 3C degraded KPNA1. This degradation happened through a caspase 3-dependent manner as with some other enteroviruses such as poliovirus. 44 These findings suggest that the viral protein and host protein interaction is a complex concept which is mediated by different factors such as the cell and tissue type, host immune system, and different hosts. Further evaluation of different cell types may result in new findings about the interaction between EV71 proteases and IFN signaling and production pathway. It will also be valuable to focus on the role of other viral proteins in IFN inhibition pathways. These studies suggest that viral-host protein interaction is a multifactorial concept and need further work and research to understand it more comprehensively.",

On the other hand, RIG I is sensitive to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with 5\u2032 triposphate (5\u2032ppp) and some double-stranded sequences within ssRNA molecules formed by RNAs of negative strand RNA viruses. However, some other reports suggest that RIG1 recognizes 5\u2032ppp single-stranded RNA with poly A/U motif and short dsRNAs. 38-43 After a burst of IFN type I in infected cells, it is released from cells and attached to an interferon receptor on the adjacent cells. After attachment of IFN to interferon receptor 1 (IFNR1) and interferon receptor 2 (IFNR2), two protein kinases including Janus kinase1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) are activated via phosphorylation resulting in activation and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) as well as signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) proteins. These two proteins create a heterodimer and interact with IRF9 to produce interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. The phosphorylated STAT1 interacts with karyopherin subunit alpha 1 (KPNA 1) which acts as a nuclear localization signal (NLS) receptor and recognizes STAT1 NLS which facilitates ISGF3 translocation to the nucleus and induces interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. 44 3 | 2A AND 3C PROTEASES 2A protease is translated firstly during the translation of the nonstructural region (P2) of enterovirus polyprotein.

TLR3 in infected RD cells remain unchanged, but in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell (HT-29 cells), 2-to-6 fold increase was seen in TLR3 transcription 36 hours after infection. 27 This increment is probably a result of IFN induction in these cells. Possibly because of this reason, mild gastrointestinal symptoms are seen in patients infected with EV71.

Almost all of the ISGs activated by IFN will diminish in the cells that are infected by EV71, but in CA16 infection, these ISGs remain high.
