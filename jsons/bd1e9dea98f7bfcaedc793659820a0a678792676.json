While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. We now report that patients with COVID-19 (n=96) have markedly elevated levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including Creactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=52 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (7805 \u00b1 7585, n=23) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3123 \u00b1 2990, p=0.0059). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, strongly implicating neutrophils as active perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.",

They exist mainly together as a biologically-functional heterodimer known as S100A8/A9 or calprotectin. Calprotectin is found in abundance in neutrophils, where it can account for almost two-thirds of soluble protein in the cytosol. Calprotectin may also be detected at low levels in monocytes, reactive macrophages, platelets, and squamous epithelial cells 2 . Upon neutrophil activation or death, calprotectin is released extracellularly where it has microbicidal functions (via heavy-metal chelation) and also serves as a pro-inflammatory ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 3 . Given its small size, easy diffusion between tissue and blood, and resistance to enzymatic degradation, calprotectin is a sensitive and dynamic marker of neutrophil activation anywhere in the body 4, 5 . High levels of calprotectin have been found in many types of infectious and inflammatory diseases-including sepsis, myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, and adult-onset Still's disease-where it tracks closely with disease severity [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Healthy volunteers were recruited through a posted flyer; exclusion criteria for these controls included history of a systemic autoimmune disease, active infection, and pregnancy. For preparation of control serum, blood was collected into serum separator tubes by a trained hospital phlebotomist. These serum samples were divided into small aliquots and stored at -80\u00b0C until the time of testing.Quantification of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin). Calprotectin levels were measured with the Human S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer DuoSet ELISA (DY8226-05, R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical analysis.When two groups were present, normally-distributed data were analyzed by two-sided t test and skewed data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. For three or moregroups, analysis was by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test with correction for multiple comparisons. Correlations were tested by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Data analysis was with GraphPad Prism software version 8. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. 21. McDonald B, Davis RP, Kim SJ, et al.
