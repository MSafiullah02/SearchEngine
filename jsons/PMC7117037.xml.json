Infectious respiratory droplets or droplet nuclei exhaled from inflected occupants can serve as pathogen carriers [3]. Virus-laden aerosol particles like those containing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-A influenza can be transported through indoor space (e.g., air cabins) by human respiratory activities. Additionally, the release of toxic chemicals and bio-aerosols in a laboratory threatens personnel health, and these contaminants must be identified in a timely manner. Extreme cases may involve the use of biochemical weapons or terrorist attacks (e.g., the Tokyo subway sarin attack of 1995) [4]. The mitigation of adverse effects of the transport of infectious bio-aerosols or the release of hazardous airborne particles necessitates effective approaches to indoor source localization.",

A forward model stores all potential release scenarios that are pre-simulated as a database, and then a potential indoor source can be identified by matching the pre-simulated and measured concentrations from an efficient search algorithm such as the Bayesian probability algorithm [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]] or optimization algorithm [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. By contrast, a backward model obtains source locations and other characteristics by reversely solving transport equations for indoor pollutants. The reverse simulation often involves measuring concentrations from a few locations as boundary or initial conditions. Typical approaches include the quasi-reversibility method [15,16], pseudo-reversibility method [17], regularization method [18,19] and probability-based inverse method [[20], [21], [22], [23]]. A more detailed review is given in Refs. [24,25]. In practical applications, the fixed-sensor network method must install sensors in advance, limiting the application scope of this type of method. Under most emergency conditions (e.g., accidents and intentional attacks), it is infeasible to quickly install enough sensors to identify a given source, and the sensor network can be easily damaged. In addition, this type of method depends on the computing of numerical models (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or multi-zone models) requiring the use of environmental information (e.g., building sizes, obstacles and ventilation systems).",

In principle, these three subtasks can be conducted by directly using sensor readings without solving complex transport equations. Sensors for a contaminant of interest are often used with a mobile platform using a single robot or multiple robots. Multi-robot methods are typically more efficient and robust in localizing indoor sources through particle swarm optimization (PSO) [28,29], ant colony optimization (ACO) [30] and adapted algorithms [[31], [32], [33], [34]].",

These behaviors significantly differ from those of gaseous contaminants and render particle transport more complex, potentially complicating source localization efforts [35]. Moreover, source localization is more difficult when the release rate of a particle source changes with time [36]. In addition, different indoor ventilation systems (such as the typical mixing and displacement ventilation systems) can alter contaminant dispersion features and exacerbate source localization complications [37].

Both modified algorithms can help robots follow the concentration gradient and upwind direction to quickly locate a source. However, as the velocity of each robot is confined by the respective airflow, both algorithms inhibit the search capacities of robots and increase the likelihood of robots becoming trapped within a local optimum.",

Concentration information guides robots to areas of higher concentration while airflow velocities help robots travel in the correct direction and to quickly find a source.

These assumptions were found to be applicable to indoor particle simulations by Holmberg and Li [47].",

The higher SR found for displacement ventilation may be attributed to the fact that airflows of displacement ventilation are more uniform than those of mixing ventilation (Fig. 8). As is shown in Fig. 12 (b), the localization time of each scenario (approximately 55 s) shows no obvious differences. The maximum average localization period of scenario MD is the longest (56.8 s) and only 14% longer than that of scenario DD with the shortest average localization period (49.7 s). In addition, the average localization period and standard deviation of scenario DP are slightly greater than those of scenario MP.

The maximum SR generated from both the SPSO and WUII methods for scenario DD was measured as 44% while the minimum SR values generated from these methods for scenario MP are 24% and 20%, respectively. These results indicate that the SPSO and WUII methods are not suited to practical conditions under which the release rate of a particle source changes with time. For these cases, the SPSO and WUII methods entrapped the robots within the local extremum area so that they could not successfully locate the source. In contrast, the minimum SR of the proposed IPSO method was measured as greater than 96%. Therefore, the IPSO method is more promising than the other two tested methods for applying to practical situations because the IPSO method can enhance robot search capacities by using the upwind term and guiding robots to leave the local extremum area until they find the source (Fig. 10).",

We also compared the performance of the proposed method to the performance of the standard PSO and WUII methods. The following conclusions are drawn:1)The proposed method can help robots successfully leave local extremum areas and rapidly locate time-varying particle sources in indoor environments with varying combinations of ventilation modes, release rate profiles, and source locations.2)The proposed method proved robust and efficient in locating transient particle sources under each examined scenario. The method achieved a success rate of above 96% and a localization time of approximately 55 s.
