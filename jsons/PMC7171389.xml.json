Though earlier, CoVs were only associated with a common cold, for the first time in 2002, new CoVs related to the \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2019 (SARS-CoV) discovered in the human population of China and caused the death of 10% of the total cases worldwide (Perlman & Netland, 2009; Rota et al., 2003). Recently, in December 2019, numerous patients from Wuhan, China, reported regarding symptoms like pneumonia. However, initially it was identified as novel coronavirus, namely, 2019-nCoV. Later, the World Health Organization (WHO) renamed that virus as \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u2019 (SARS-CoV2) and the diseased caused by them is known as \u2018coronavirus disease 2019\u2019 (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the WHO officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic (Ramphul & Mejias, 2020). On March 28, 2020, 614169 confirmed cases with 28239 deaths and 933 confirmed cases are reported in India with 20 deaths (https://mohfw.gov.in & WHO). Thus, there is an urgent requirement to understand the virulence mechanisms associated with these pathogens, which in turn permits the development of more effective remedies for early prevention as well as controlling future outbreaks.",

Here they sprout within the lumen and consequently conveyed outside the cell through \u2018exocytosis\u2019 within the cargo vesicles (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994; Tooze & Tooze, 1985). It is comprised of a positive-strand RNA genome of size 29.7 kb and encodes a viral replicase that is associated with the novel genome synthesis and generation of a \u2018nested set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs, encoding both structural proteins present in all CoVs: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N), and a group of proteins specific for SARS-CoV: 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b\u2019(Nieto-Torres et al., 2014). While M and S protein constitutes the major portion of the viral envelope, E proteins are reported to oligomerize and form ion channels (Venkatagopalan et al., 2015). The E protein is located along with S-spike glycoprotein (Li et al., 2020), where it played a significant role in the assembly of the viral genome (Westerbeck & Machamer, 2019).",

It start a with short hydrophilic terminal followed by large hydrophobic transmembrane domain and terminates with long hydrophilic carboxyl end. Hydrophobic region oligomerise and form an ion-conductive pore in membranes. This protein play key role in various phases of the virus\u2019 life cycle, such as envelope formation, pathogenesis, budding and assembly (Ashour et al., 2020; Schoeman & Fielding, 2019). Few studies have also suggested that the \u2018SARS-CoV E\u2019 proteins\u2019 ion channel activity is modulated via pentameric ion channel (Pervushin et al., 2009). The \u2018SARS-CoV E\u2019 protein\u2019s ion channel activity is detected in the transmembrane region of the protein (Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2004). Selectivity, as well as ion conductance associated with the E protein ion channel, are mostly modulated via the lipid membranes charge within which the pores aggregates.

Furthermore, as identifying novel drugs through laboratory approaches demands huge capital as well as investments, there is a continuous demand for screening drug molecules via high screeening computational methods that saves both money as well as times (Gupta, Donde, et al., 2019; Gupta & Vadde, 2020b; Gupta & Vadde, 2020a).

Recently, genome of the first SARS-CoV2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) has also been successfully sequenced and submitted in GenBank (Accession no. MN908947.3) (Shang et al., 2020). By considering the above information, in the present study, authors employed computational approach for identifying the best possible structure of the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein present in the PDB database to understand its structure and function as well as its behaviour towards various phytochemicals. This, in turn, may help us in identifying few phytochemicals that may inhibit the function of the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein; thereby preventing the pathogenesis associated with SARS-CoV2. In the near future, these phytochemicals may serve as a good contestants for treating diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 after further laboratory investigation.",

The NCBI protein database was utilized for downloading the human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein sequence (ID: YP_009724392.1). Multalin, a web-based tool was implemented to detect difference between \u2018SARS-CoV E\u2019 and \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein. Subseqeuntly, sequence of \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein was subjected to NCBI\u2019s utility \u2018BLASTp\u2019 (Altschul et al., 1990). Based on maximum sequence identity (81%), structure with PDB (Protein Data Bank) ID 5 \u00d7 29 is detected as the best homologous structure of human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein. As the \u2018SARS-CoV E\u2019 protein function as a homopentamer (Pervushin et al., 2009), the complete structure of 5 \u00d7 29, comprised of five chains, was employed for downstream analysis.",

As \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein resides is a transmembrane region, at first, downloaded structure of 5 \u00d7 29 was embedded in the \u2018equilibrated bilayer of DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine)\u2019 using \u2018g_membed\u2019 tool of \u2018GROMACS 5.1\u2019 (Wolf et al., 2010) using the aid of \u2018Berger lipids\u2019 derived parameters from \u2018Berger, Edholm, and Jahnig\u2019 (Berger et al., 1997).

Pressure fluctuates within \u2212311.56 bar & 338.38 bar with an average value 1.75 bar. The temperature fluctuates within 296.97 K & 303.30 K with an average value of 299.99 K. Density fluctuates within 973.57 & 991.84 kg/m3 with an average value 980.78 kg/m3. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) & root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of C\u03b1 atoms as a function of residue number and radius of gyration (Rg) as a function of simulation time (Donde et al., 2019; Gouda et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2018; Mehrnejad & Chaparzadeh, 2008; Rani & Lakshmi, 2019; Tandon et al., 2015) were employed for estimating the protein stability during the MD analysis. The average RMSD value of the protein backbone atoms is estimated to be 2.74 \u00c5 (Figure 2(a)). RMSD is found to be stable subsequently 170 ns. The value of RMSF fluctuates within 4 \u00c5 & 6.3 \u00c5 with an average value of 5.96 \u00c5. Amino acids that undergo maximum fluctuation during 200 ns MDS were VAL17, ALA22, LEU19, LEU27, PHE23, PHE26, LEU27, VAL24, VAL25, VAL29, ILE33, ALA36 and TYR42 (i.e. RMSF > 6 nm). As these residues play an important role during protein-ligand interaction, they may serve as a biomarker during the drug discovery process (Gouda et al., 2020; Gupta & Vadde, 2019a, 2020a, 2020b) (Figure 2(b)). The Rg values of the protein (Figure 2(c)), fluctuates within 5.81 \u00c5 & 5.83 \u00c5 with an average value of 5.82 \u00c5; thereby supporting its condensed architecture as well as size (Donde et al., 2019; Gupta & Vadde, 2019b).

Mean number of \u2018intra-protein\u2019 hydrogen bond & \u2018inter-hydrogen\u2019 bond formed between \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein & water is 1.98 and 1.98, respectively. \u2018Cross-correlation matrix\u2019 of the C-\u03b1 displacement revealed that all residues present within the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein experience both negative (depicted via blue shades) as well as positive correlated motions (depicted via red shades) (Figure 3(a)), which in turn support random movement of the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein. This finding is also in accordance with the \u2018free energy landscape\u2019 analysis (Figure 4(a)). Minimal energy associated with the FEL for the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein at 20 to 200 ns with difference of 20 ns are 0.20, 0.28, 0.32, 0.38, 0.41, 0.41, 0.43, 0.43, 0.45 and 0.49 kcal/mol respectively.",

In all three complexes, the temperature fluctuates within \u223c295.24 K & \u223c304.98 K with an average value of 300.00 K. Average RMSD value of the protein backbone atoms in Complex A-C is estimated to be 1.75 \u00c5, 2.16 \u00c5 and 2.56 \u00c5, respectively (Figure 2(a)). RMSD in all the three complexes is found to be stable subsequently 180 ns. The Rg values of all three complexes (Figure 2(c)) support their condensed architecture as well as size (Gupta & Vadde, 2020). Minimal energy associated with the FEL for the Complex A at 20 to 200 ns with difference of 20 ns are 0.26, 0.36, 0.25, 0.31, 0.35, 0.37, 0.40, 0.42, 0.42, 0.43, 0.44 & 0.44 kcal/mol respectively. Minimal energy associated with the FEL for the Complex B at 20 to 200 ns with difference of 20 ns are 0.26, 0.31, 0.31, 0.37, 0.38, 0.40, 0.41, 0.43, 0.45 & 0.45 kcal/mol respectively. Minimal energy associated with the FEL for the Complex C at 20 to 200 ns with difference of 20 ns are 0.26, 0.36, 0.37, 0.39, 0.40, 0.41, 0.42, 0.42, 0.44 & 0.47 kcal/mol, respectively. Result obtained from the PCA analysis suggests that the movement of Complex A < Complex B < Complex C< \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein (Figure 2(d)). This might be due to decreased potential energy and increased pressure in all the three complexes, which in turn supports that the random movement of the \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein decrease after binding with these phytochemicals (Figure 2(d)); thereby supporting that these three phytochemicals may function as drugs for treating or controlling diseases caused via SARS-CoV2 in human.",

Results obtained revealed that the human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 is a pentameric protein comprised of 35 \u03b1-helices and 40 loops. During 200 ns, \u03b1-helix and loops present in this protein experiences random movement, which in turn modulate normal ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein gets reduced; this, in turn, inhibits the function of the human \u2018SARS-CoV2 E\u2019 protein. It is pertinent to note that, this is for the first time, authors are reporting about the medicinal property of Macaflavanone E, Vibsanol B. As these three phytochemicals, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E & Vibsanol B, have passed the ADMET test and \u2018Lipinski\u2019s Rule of 5s\u2019, they may be utilized in controlling disease caused via SARS-CoV2, in near future, after further in vitro and in vivo investigations.",
