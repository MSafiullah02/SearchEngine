The thought from these guidelines is that masks do not necessarily protect healthy people from getting infected in a public setting. The official guidelines say that people should stick to frequent hand-washing and maintaining a social distance (> 6 feet).

We recommend that everyone in the healthcare setting be required to wear masks, including medical staff, support staff, research staff, patients, and visitors. We hope the officials will enforce or put this in the guidelines. According to the current evidence, COVID-19 virus is transmitted easily between people by droplets carried through sneezing and close contact through respiratory tract 13 . Recent research shows that talking to people and airborne can transmit coronavirus 14 . A very recent study published on April 3, 2020 demonstrated that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses from symptomatic individuals 15 . Moreover, presymptomatic or asymptomatic coronavirus carriers could spread the COVID-19 coronaviruses 16 . In addition, keeping social distancing (e.g., stay at least 6 feet away from other people) may not be enough when people are moving around.",

Since early March this year, there has been an exponential growth for the COVID-19 coronavirus in the US. All of the measures recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and US president are needed. The current US president's coronavirus guidelines for Americans \"15 Days to Slow The Spread\" 3 (Figure 1) were issued on March 16, 2020. The CDC's guidelines are similar to the US president's coronavirus guidelines for Americans 4 . Yet, 15 days have since passed, and we are still on an exponential growth curve with no end in sight.During this writing, President Trump announced on March 29, 2020 that the coronavirus guidelines for American \"15 Days to Slow The Spread\" (now \"30 Days to Slow The Spread\" ) would remain in place until April 30, 2020 5 . However, it is hard to say now that two more weeks of the same measures will likely effectively stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus if we do not modify the current guidelines.",
