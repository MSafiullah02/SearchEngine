Many providers have appropriately cancelled nonemergent surgical procedures and converted ambulatory in-person appointments to remote video visits or phone calls. As hospitals throughout the United States begin to fill with patients afflicted with COVID-19 and other acute illnesses, the need to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and to reduce the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission to patients and providers is critical. Likewise, it is imperative to rapidly triage, diagnose, and provide disposition for nonCOVID-19-related urgent and emergent hospital visits.",

We aim to describe these types of remote consultation, medical documentation and billing requirements, and demonstrate a process for rapid implementation. Our hope is that other consulting specialists can implement similar programs, contribute to PPE preservation, and minimize unnecessary physical exposure without compromising medical care.",

As a result, clinicians across the United States have rapidly adopted the use of video visits to replace in-person outpatient visits during the COVID-19 emergency. 4 Many of these regulatory changes are directly applicable to physician consultation in both the ED and inpatient settings. Video visits can be used to evaluate patients without a procedural need or for conditions where physical exam is not a major contributor to clinical decision making. 5 During the COVID-19 emergency, this will facilitate rapid assessment and disposition from the ED and promote essential goals: preserving PPE, limiting potential exposures and the possible spread of disease in the ED and inpatient settings. Although this method of consultation may be new for many providers, video visits have been used for years to assess patients presenting with stroke symptoms to facilitate rapid decisions on tissue plasminogen activator use. 6, 7 The appropriate documentation and consenting process for ED and inpatient video visit consultation are identical to outpatient video visit requirements. In addition to standard evaluation and management components of a consultation note, providers should document (1) consent of the patient to a video visit, (2) the location of the patient and the provider at time of the encounter, (3) the time spent for the consultation. We also encourage providers to document a statement that the visit was conducted via video to preserve PPE and limit exposures during the COVID-19 emergency. The specific CPT codes for initial and follow-up video visit consultations are provided for reference (Table 1) .",

This method of consultation allows for rapid, direct, and documented communication of recommendations from the consultant to the treating provider. 9, 10 It is important to note that the consultant must be a physician. Like video visits, the use of eConsults has typically been reserved for outpatient care; however, there are no restrictions for its application to inpatient and ED consultation. 11 There are important billing and documentation requirements for eConsults. First, the requesting provider needs to briefly obtain and document verbal consent from the patient for the use of eConsults. Second, the consulting physician should document (1) the reason for consultation, (2) findings from the medical records, (3) further evaluation and/or treatment recommendations, and (4) the time spent reviewing the record and speaking with the requesting physician (if applicable). Lastly, if upon reviewing the clinical record, the consultant determines that a formal video or in-person consultation is recommended (either immediately or as an outpatient), or if an in-person consultation occurs within 14 days, then the eConsult is no longer a billable event. The appropriate billing codes are listed in Table 1 . One important nuance is that code 99451 is used when there is no verbal report given to the requesting provider after the recommendations are documented in the eConsult note. This is more often utilized in the outpatient setting but may also be appropriate for inpatient use.",
