            "text": "A great volume of available genomic data has made possible analysis of large sets of organisms at the whole genome scale. However, given that most genomes contain millions to billion nucleotides, traditional molecular analysis methods based on multiple sequence alignment become impractical due to their high computation complexity (Vinga and Almeida, 2003). Consequently, considerable efforts have been made to seek for the alignment-free method for sequence analysis. The first, mainly based on graphical representation of the sequence, is very convenient for studying several selected cases (Liao et al., 2005, Jeffrey, 1990, Nandy, 1994, Nandy and Nandy, 1995, Nandy and Nandy, 2003, Randic and Vracko, 2000; Randic et al., 2001, Randic et al., 2003a, Randic et al., 2003b, Randic et al., 2006; Randic and Balaban, 2003, Randic, 2008, Zhang and Zhang, 1994). One of the aim of graphical representation is to identity regions of interest or the distribution of base along the sequence visually (Zhang and Zhang, 1994). The second approach, has been proposed to characterize the DNA sequence (Akhtar et al., 2007). For this purpose one has to find representative descriptors that characterize an abstract mathematical representation of the biological sequence (Dai et al., 2006, He and Wang, 2002). A commonly used numerical characterization of the sequence is to consider binary sequences that describe the position of each nucleotide (Voss, 1992). Different approaches are described in a recent review (Nandy et al., 2006).",

Any DNA sequence can be converted into a unique numerical sequence with the same length. In the representation, each number represents the distance of a nucleotide to the next occurrence of the same nucleotide. Meanwhile Nair and Mahalashmi (2005) employed discrete Fourier transformation to the inter-nucleotide distance sequence and indicated that this method has a discriminatory capability for highlighting the promoter region of gene sequence. However, Akhtar and Epps (2008) proved that it has poor accuracy in the exon prediction. Afreixo et al. (2009) developed a new method to analyze the inter-nucleotide distance sequence and extracted some interesting features of the DNA sequence. Four nucleotide inter-nucleotide distance distributions and a global distance distribution were given to each genome sequence. In each nucleotide inter-nucleotide distance distribution, only the total number of three other nucleotides was considered (Afreixo et al., 2009). In fact, we can extract more information about the genome sequence from their inter-nucleotide distance sequences.",

In case of the inter-nucleotide distance sequence about nucleotide A, the number of the nucleotide C, the number of the nucleotide G and the number of the nucleotide T would follow multinomial distribution given that inter-nucleotide distance is k. This multinomial distribution will be called the conditional multinomial distribution. The relative error vector derived from the conditional multinomial distribution then can be used as a genomic signature that identifies each species. This approach allows us to perform comparative analysis between complete genome sequences. In fact, we propose a new evolutionary information representation, complete multinomial composition vector (CMCV), by using a collection of multinomial composition vectors. These multinomial composition vectors are built on the relative error vectors of conditional multinomial distributions with k, where k is within a range. The range of k is determined to ensure that the CMCV contains the largest amount of evolutionary information hidden in the whole genomic data. We then define the evolutionary distance between two genomes based on their complete multinomial composition vectors. The proposed method is tested by phylogenetic analysis on 24 coronavirus genomes. Our results demonstrate that the new method is powerful and efficient.",

Mutations have been taking place randomly at molecular level and natural selections shape the direction of evolution. Many neutral mutations may remain and play a role of random background. One should subtract the random background from the simple counting result in order to highlight the contribution of selective evolution (Chang and Wang, 2011, Ding et al., 2010, Gao et al., 2006). In this work, we propose a new conditional multinomial distribution representation which reveals the relative difference of biological sequence from sequence generated by an independent random process to remove the random background.",

Group I and group II contain mammalian viruses, whereas group III contains only avian. Many investigations have attempted to identify the phylogenetic position of SARS-CoVs. However, this is still a controversial topic-alignment-based methods showed that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any groups and form a new group (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003); maximum likelihood tree built from a fragment of the spike protein preferred SARS-CoVs clustering with group II (Li\u00f2 and Goldman, 2004); while an information-based method, which makes use of the whole genome sequences, indicated that SARS-CoVs are close to the group I rather than from a new group (Yang et al., 2005).
