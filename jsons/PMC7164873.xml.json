A rotating shift schedule would allow exposed residents periods of self-quarantine without compromising patient care. In later phases of the pandemic, a shift schedule would allow residents infected with COVID-19 to recuperate without risking patient transmission. Indeed, many residency programs in Boston have moved toward a shift-based schedule, in which residents work for 1-2 weeks and then are rotated off for the same amount of time. Residents are discouraged from interacting with off-rotation residents to reduce the amount of resident-resident transmission.",
