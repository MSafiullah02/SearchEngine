High rates of transmissibility, primarily through airborne droplets and aerosols and international travel, have led to a worldwide pandemic. The United States (US) leads the world in the number of COVID-19 cases, and there are growing concerns regarding the potential strain on its healthcare systems due to the intensive care needed for critically ill COVID-19 patients (2). Initial reports from other countries have already highlighted the stress of COVID-19 on their intensive care units (ICU) and resources (3). A recent case series of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Seattle, Washington reported a median ICU stay of 14 days and a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 10 days (4). With emergency departments and ICUs triaging and caring for increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, there is little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a tremendous impact on available resources for the triage and treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Here, we present an overview of COVID-19, recommendations for acute stroke care and treatment, and provide an illustrative case study of stroke in a COVID-19 positive patient.",

Males are more likely to have severe symptoms and have a higher rate of mortality than females (6, 7). In a study of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 patients in China, 80% of those who died were 65 years or older (8). Patients between 60 and 69, 70 and 79, and above 80 years of age have a mortality rate of ~4, 10, and 21%, respectively (5, 9). Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU have mortality rates of ~26% (7). Furthermore, patients with co-morbidities are considered high-risk, specifically those with hypertension (10). Of 1,625 deaths in Italy, 25% of patients had one co-morbidity, 25% had two, almost half had three or more co-morbidities, and <1% of patients did not have any co-morbidities (5). Shared risk factors for stroke and severe COVID-19 include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (11\u201313). In a Chinese study of 191 patients, hypertension (OR 3.05; 1.57\u20135.92), diabetes (OR 2.85; 1.35\u20136.05), and coronary artery disease (OR 21.4; 4.6\u201398.7) were independently associated with death from COVID-19 (10). Another study revealed that those with cardiovascular disease and an elevated troponin had a mortality rate of 69% (14).",

Presence of multilobe infiltrates, lymphopenia (\u2264 0.8 \u00d7 109/L), bacterial co-infection, smoking status, age, and hypertension are scored to give estimated mortality ranges from 2% to >69% (16).",

Presenting symptoms may include fever, cough, myalgia, and/or fatigue, and less commonly nausea or vomiting, sputum production, and diarrhea (21, 22). In one study, median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 7 days, to development of dyspnea was 8 days, and to severe respiratory distress was 9 days (23). Patients with severe COVID-19 may develop severe respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, sepsis, secondary infection, coagulopathy, or acute cardiac injury at presentation or within a few days of admission (10).

Although patients with neurological symptoms are more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease, many present with neurological symptoms as the only presenting symptom of COVID-19. Anosmia is an early, common, specific, and often initial symptom of COVID-19, which may improve with resolution of illness (30). Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported in over 85% of patients with infection (31). CNS involvement has been hypothesized to occur from hematogenous spread or direct involvement of the olfactory bulb and retrograde neuronal invasion (32, 33). Case reports of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and acute myelitis in COVID-19 patients have recently been described (29, 34\u201337). COVID-19 has also been detected in CSF and long term neurological sequelae of COVID-19 remain unknown (38).",

For patients with stroke, a proinflammatory state triggered by cytokines may contribute to vascular endothelial injury or a hypercoagulable state which may result in extensive thrombosis and microvascular dysfunction (41\u201343). These hypotheses are supported by elevated D-dimers in patients with severe COVID-19, anecdotal reports of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and normal coronary arteries (44), and reports of limb ischemia (43, 45). Furthermore, use of heparin has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 (46). Lung biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 has shown small vessel hyperplasia, vessel wall thickening, luminal stenosis, occlusion, and micro-thrombosis (47).",

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) benefit from mechanical thrombectomy (MT) within 24 h from \u201clast seen normal\u201d time (49\u201355). Although the use of intravenous tPA for AIS has not been studied in patients with COVID-19, its use is imperative for eligible patients with AIS. Given the current crisis, selection of patients for MT poses new challenges and requires refinement of established protocols. Recently published recommendations from the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) recommend that MT should be performed in patients in which there is high-quality data to support benefit (56). The decision to perform MT in patients outside established guidelines should be pursued in the context of resource availability and balanced against the risks and benefits to the patient as well as the treating health-care providers.",

Patients for whom there is clinical equipoise, such as those with anterior or posterior circulation LVO and low NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale), distal occlusions, low ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score), or minimal to moderate penumbral tissue, should be managed conservatively. Patients with an ASPECTS score of 5 or less have poor functional outcomes, high rates of futile reperfusion, and should be managed conservatively in the current climate (64, 65). Patients with low NIHSS and LVO, should be monitored closely, given possible subsequent clinical deterioration from COVID-19 related hypoxia or altered hemodynamics. In cases of subsequent clinical deterioration, MT should be performed if they meet established LVO guidelines. Institutions enrolling patients with clinical equipoise for MT in randomized clinical trials should halt enrollment and provide medical management in these patients for now.",

With appropriate precautions, MT for patients younger than 80 years with LVO and suspected COVID-19 who may potentially benefit is a reasonable approach. In patients younger than 80 years with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19, use of pre-treatment thrombectomy scores such as HIAT2 (67), THRIVE (68), and PRE (69) in conjunction with COVID-19 predictors may provide important insight to guide discussions of treatment goals and expectations of long-term clinical outcome (See Figure 1 for proposed algorithm for patients with suspected LVO).",

This can be achieved by placing a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter exhausting clean air back to the air system or through a window to the atmosphere and sealing any other exhaust/return air ducts. A pressure monitor should be visible in the room to ensure a pressure differential of \u22122.5 Pa has been reached. This can be achieved by increasing the flow on the HEPA machine and should provide at least 12 air changes per hour (74).
