Nanopowders of metals can be used as antibacterial substrates (e.g., the combination of the pure nanosilver ion with fiber to create antiodor socks) [7].

For example, the strength of nanocrystalline nickel is five orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding microcrystalline nickel [18]. Interestingly, the observed strength of crystalline nanomaterials is accompanied by a loss of ductility, which can result in a limitation of their utility [19]. However, some of the nanocrystalline materials have the ability to undergo considerable elongation and plastic deformation without failing (even up to 100\u2013300%). Such machinability and superplasticity properties have been observed for ceramics (including monoliths and composites), metals (including aluminum, magnesium, iron, titanium), intermetallic elements (including iron, nickel, and titanium base), and laminates [20]. Although the atomic weight of carbon nanotubes is about one-sixth of the weight of steel, their Young\u2019s modulus and tensile strength are, respectively, five and 100 times higher than those of steel [21]. In addition, nanoparticles, because of their very small sizes and surface/interface effects such as the fundamental change in coordination, symmetry, and confinement, they may exhibit high magnetic susceptibility. A variety of nanoparticles reveal anomalous magnetic properties such as superparamagnetism. This opens new areas of potential application for them, such as data storage and ferrofluid technology [22].",

For instance, the high biocompatibility of magnetite nanocrystals (Fe3O4) makes them potentially useful as the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents [23]. One of the unique aspects of nanoparticles is their high wettability, termed by Fujishima [24] as superhydrophilicity. Depending upon the chemical composition, the surface can exhibit superhydrophilic characteristics. For example, titanium dioxide (TiO2), at sizes below a few nm, can decrease the water contact angle to 0\u00b11\u00b0 [24]. Nano-sized composites, due to the chemical composition and viscosity of the intercrystalline phase, may provide a significant increase in creep resistance. It has been demonstrated that alumina/silicon carbide composites are characterized by a minimum creep rate, three times lower than the corresponding monolith [25].",

This is not possible with the same material in a larger form [35]. Indeed, reduction of the particle\u2019s size to the nanoscale level results in a steady increase of the surface to volume ratio. As a consequence, a larger number of potentially active groups per mass unit is \u201cavailable\u201d on the surface and might interact with biological systems [35]. This is one possible explanation why nano-sized particles of a given compound are generally more toxic than the same compound in its larger form [36].",

For instance, a nanoparticle of ceramic zirconium oxide, existing in bulk form and synthesized at a temperature of 800\u00b0C can be expressed by the code \u201cZr,O,O,CER,%E\u201d [80]. Similar to the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), the international chemical identifier (InChI) might also be used directly as a descriptor of chemical composition [89]. Another possibility is to apply descriptors derived from either molecular graph (MG) or the graphs of atomic orbitals (GAO) theory [90\u201392]. In the first case, vertexes in the graph represent atoms, while edges represent covalent bonds. In the second method, vertexes refer to particular atomic orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p, etc.), while edges connect the orbitals belonging to different atoms (Figure 14-1). Based on the molecular graphs, Faulon and coworkers [93\u201396] have developed the signature molecular descriptor approach for the characterization of fullerenes and nanotubes. The signature is a vector including extended valences of atoms derived from a set of subgraphs, following the five-step algorithm:\nconstructing of a subgraph containing all atoms and bonds that are at a distance no greater than the given signature height;labeling the vertices in a canonical order;constructing a tree spanning all the edges;removing of all canonical labels that appear only one time;writing the signature by reading the tree in a depth-first order.\n\n",

Among others, they include: molecular geometry (bond lengths, valence, and torsion angles), electron distribution, ionization potential, electron affinity, surface reactivity, and band gap. When performing quantum-mechanical calculations, there are always two important assumptions to be introduced. First one is an appropriate molecular model; the second one is the appropriate level of the theory.

The situation is very common for larger crystalline nanoparticles (i.e., nanoparticles of metal oxides: TiO2, Al2O3, SnO2, ZnO, etc.) and, in such cases, a simplified model of the whole structure must first be appropriately selected. In general, there are two strategies for modeling of crystalline solids: (i) an application of the periodic boundary conditions (PBSs) and (ii) calculations based on the molecular clusters. In the first approach, calculations for a single unit cell are expanded in the three dimensions with respect to the translational symmetry by employing appropriate boundary conditions (i.e., the unit cell should be neutral and should have no dipole moment). In doing so, the model includes information on the long-range forces occurring in the crystal. However, the cell size should be large enough to also be able to model defects in the surface and to eliminate the spurious interactions between periodically repeated fragments of the lattice [100\u2013102].",

This must be performed by reaching a compromise between the number of atoms (and thus the required time of computations) and the expected accuracy (and hence level of the theory to be employed). It is worth mentioning that the molecular properties can be divided into two groups depending on how they change with increasing size of the cluster (going from molecular clusters to the bulk form). They are (i) scalable properties, varying smoothly until reaching the bulk limit and (ii) non-scalable properties, when the variation related to increasing size of the cluster is not monotonic.

Interestingly, the experimental results can be combined with numerical methods to define new descriptors.

They found out that the ionization potentials decrease, while the electron affinities increase in going from the C60 fullerenes to the closed nanodisks, capsules, and open bowl-shaped nanocarbon clusters. In similar studies performed for capped and uncapped carbon nanotubes at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory by Yumura et al. [107, 108], the authors demonstrated that the tube lengths, edge structures, and end caps play an important role in determining the band gap expressed as a difference between the energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO\u2013LUMO) and vibrational frequencies. Wang and Mezey [109] characterized electronic structures of open-ended and capped carbon nanoneedles (CNNs) at the same theory level (B3LYP/6-311G(d)) concluding that conductivity of the studied species is strictly correlated to their size. Only very long CNNs structures have band gaps sufficiently narrow to be semiconductors, while the band gaps of very short and thin structures are too large to conduct electrons. Similarly, Poater et al. [110, 111] observed that the Parr electrophilicity and electronic movement described by the chemical potential increase with increasing length of the carbon nanoneedles and very \u201cshort\u201d structures (containing four layers and less) have a HOMO\u2013LUMO gap too large to allow conductivity. Moreover, Simeon et al.

Similarly, the bulk limits of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap and the detachment energy for titanium oxide anion clusters of increasing size (increasing n) were reached already for n=7 [114, 115].",

Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to fulfill all of these principles for (Q)SARs applicable to nanomaterials. There are two main difficulties related to the development of nano-QSARs.

Thus, it is impossible to assume one common applicability domain for all nanomaterials. Each mode of toxicity and each class of nanomaterials should be studied separately. Analyzing the literature data (Section 14.3) it must be concluded that even if a class of structurally similar nanoparticles is tested with the same laboratory protocol, the number of tested compounds is often insufficient to perform comprehensive internal and external validation of a model and to calculate the appropriate measures of robustness and predictivity in QSAR. For instance, Limbach et al. [116] have proposed two rankings of cytotoxicity of seven oxide nanoparticles based on the in vitro study of human and rodent cells. The rankings were as follows: (i) Fe2O3\u2248asbestos > ZnO > CeO2\u2248ZrO2\u2248TiO2\u2248Ca3(PO4)2 and (ii) ZnO > asbestos\u2248ZrO2 > Ca3(PO4)2\u2248Fe2O3\u2248CeO2\u2248TiO2, respectively, for human (mesothelinoma) and rodent cells. In another paper by the same research group, the authors have found that for four metal nanoparticles \u2013 namely, TiO2, Fe2O3, Mn3O4, and Co3O4 \u2013 the chemical composition was the main factor determining the formation of reactive oxygen responsible for toxicity toward human lung epithelial cells [117]. Obviously, the results cannot be combined together and a data set containing five or six compounds is too small to build an appropriately validated QSAR model.",

Currently, there are only a small number of QSARs related directly to nanomaterials\u2019 activity. In 2007 Tsakovska [128] proposed the application of QSAR methodology to predict protein\u2013nanoparticle interactions. In 2008 Durdagi et al. published two papers [129, 130] presenting QSAR-based design of novel inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 aspartic protease (HIV-1 PR). In the first work [130] the authors developed a three-dimensional QSAR model with comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) method for 49 derivatives of fullerene C60. The values of R\n2 and Q\n2 for the training set (n=43) were 0.99 and 0.74, respectively. The absolute values of residuals in the validation set (n=6) ranged from 0.25 to 0.99 logarithmic units of EC\n50 (\u03bcM). The second model [129] were characterized by lower values of the statistics (n=17, R\n2=0.99 and Q\n2=0.56). However, in that case the predictions for an external set of compounds (n\ntest=3) were possible with an acceptable level of error. In addition, the authors proposed nine novel structures indicating possible inhibitor activity based on the model obtained. They concluded that steric effects play the most important role in the inhibition mechanism as well as electrostatic and H-donor/acceptor properties. However, the last two types of interactions are of lower importance. Similarly, SMILES-based optimal descriptors have been successfully applied for modeling HIV-1 PR fullerene-based inhibitors [131]. The model reported by Toropov et al.

In many cases, lack of data precludes an appropriate implementation of statistical methods, including necessary external validation of the model. The problem of the paucity of data will be solved only when a strict collaboration between the experimentalists and QSAR modelers is established. The role of the modelers in such studies should not be restricted only to rationalization of the data after completing the experimental part, but also they must be involved in the planning of the experimentation. Since the experiments on nanomaterials are usually expensive, a kind of compromise between the highest possible number of compounds for testing and the lowest number of compounds necessary for developing a reliable QSAR model should be reached. Regarding the limited amount of data and high costs of the experiments, the idea of applying novel read-across techniques enabling preliminary estimation of data (10.1007/978-1-4020-9783-6_7) [82, 133] is very promising.

On the other hand, a proper characterization of the nanomaterials structure is not possible only at the theoretical (computational) level. In such situation, experiment-based structural descriptors for nano-QSAR might be required.It is possible that the current criteria of the models\u2019quality (the five OECD rules) will have to be re-evaluated and adapted to nanomaterials. This is due to the specific properties of chemicals occurring at the \u201cnano\u201d level (i.e., electronic properties change with changing size) and the very limited number of data (problems with the \u201cclassic\u201d method of validation which is biased to small, low molecular weight molecules).Greater effort is required in the areas of grouping nanomaterials and nano-read-across. This technique might be useful especially at the initial stage of nano-QSAR studies, when the experimental data are scarce.\n",
