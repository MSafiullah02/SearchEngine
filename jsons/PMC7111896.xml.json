            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is highly contagious enteric viral disease of swine, characterized by diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration, followed by high mortality in new born piglets (50\u2013100%). The aetiological agent called Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Jung and Saif, 2015). PEDV may infect animals of all ages but older pigs usually show a milder form of the disease with lower mortality rates (Alvarez et al., 2015). PEDV has been firstly detected in the United Kingdom in 1978, and since then has spread worldwide causing significant economic losses in all main swine producing areas, including Asia and North America, (Horie et al., 2016; Lee, 2015; Song and Park, 2012; Sun et al., 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014). In Europe, PEDV spread to most countries between the 1970s and 1990s (Saif et al., 2012); then outbreaks became infrequent (Song and Park, 2012) but the virus persisted in an endemic form in the pig population at a low rate, causing sporadic cases in weaner or feeder pigs in few European countries. In Italy, PEDV re-emerged in a typical epidemic form in 2005 to 2006 (Martelli et al., 2008), but the disease progressively disappeared once more. Recently, following the 2013 epidemic in the US, single, limited or multiple PEDV outbreaks have been diagnosed in several European countries (Dastjerdi et al., 2015; EFSA, 2016; Grasland et al., 2015; Hanke et al., 2015; Hanke et al., 2017; Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018; Mesquita et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2015; Steinrigl et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2015; Toplak et al., 2016; Van der Wolf et al., 2015), including Italy (Alborali et al., 2014; Boniotti et al., 2016). The disease spread from 2015 onward, causing hundreds of cases, mainly in high-density pig production areas in the Po valley (North Italy), affecting fattening units as well as farrow-to-finish or farrow-to-weaner farms (Boniotti et al., 2018), and characterized by high variability of size and clinical disease. Based on their genome, isolates from these cases were closely related to each other (Boniotti et al., 2016). Following sequencing, they were classified as S INDEL strain, being the German isolate (Stadler et al., 2015) 99.4% identical to the OH851 strain isolated in the US in January 2014 (Wang et al., 2014). The circulating strains responsible for the outbreaks in 2014 in Italy were genetically analysed and he comparison of partial sequences of the RdRp and membrane (M) genes and the total glycoprotein spike (S1) gene showed a high nt identity with the S-INDEL strain USA/OH851/2014 from the USA (98.7%, 99.8%, 99.3\u201399.5%, respectively) and with the strains detected in Germany (100%, 100%, 99.7%).This situation was totally different from what detected from 2007 to 2012 when the PEDV strains circulating in Italy showed a high genetic variability. In particular, a novel coronavirus generated by recombination between PEDV and TGEV, called Swine Enteric Coronavirus (SeCoV), was identified (EFSA, 2016; Boniotti et al., 2016). Moreover, in May 2016 a PEDV/SeCoV recombinant strain was detected In Italy; this new strain rapidly spread since January 2017 and then overcome the S-INDEL OH851-like strain, representing nowadays over 90% of the circulating strains (Papetti et al., 2017).",

Each genogroup can be further separated into subgroups 1a and 1b, and 2a and 2b, respectively. G1a comprises the prototype PEDV strain, CV777, vaccine strains (e.g., 83P-5 cited by Colin et al., 2015) and other cell culture-adapted strains, whereas G1b includes new variants detected in China, United States and South Korea, and more recently in Europe. G2a and G2b contain global field isolates that were responsible for earlier local epidemics in Asia and recent pandemic outbreaks in North America and Asia, respectively. The US G1b variants were called S INDEL strains because of the presence of insertions and a deletion in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 gene compared to sequences of original US G2b PEDV strains (Huang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lee, 2015).",

The virus is present and excreted by infected animals for a limited period, typically less than one month (Lee, 2015), while the serological response is expected to last for a much longer period (Crawford et al., 2015).

Moreover, in order to reduce nonspecific binding, yeast extract [1%] (Biolife Italiana Srl, Milan, Italy) and mouse serum [1%] (IZSLER, Brescia, Italy) were added to the PBS for saturating sites that were still free after adsorption. Internal controls were included in each plate: the positive and negative control sera and the 100% control wells, and all were examined as double repetitions. Control (negative and positive) sera were collected respectively from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs and from animals experimentally infected with a PEDV INDEL-strain identified in Italy on 2015 (strain 10,674/2015). A volume of 50 \u03bcL of antigen (whole VERO cell culture-adapted G1a PEDV strain CV777, inactivated with \u03b2-propriolactone) optimally diluted (1:3) in the dilution buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.2 \u00b1 0.2, containing Tween 20 [0.05%], yeast extract [1%]) was added to all the samples and controls, in which 50 \u03bcL of the dilution buffer was added. At the end of a 60 \u00b1 5 min incubation at 37 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 50 \u03bcL of each sample or control-antigen mixture were transferred onto the previously coated microplate. A volume of 25 \u03bcL/well of the HRP-conjugated 4C3 MAb (10 mg/mL, 1:1000 in dilution buffer) was added, and the plates were incubated again by applying the same described conditions.

Finally, the reaction was blocked after 10 \u00b1 2 min by adding 50 \u03bcL/well of 1 M sulfuric acid (Carlo Erba Reagents Srl, Cornaredo, Milan, Italy). The optical density (OD) of the samples was read at 492 nm, using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan EX, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Farms were classified as non-exposed to PEDV based on historical data and lack of enteric signs compatible with viral diarrhoea. The observation period in each farm lasted at least four months, during which multiple faecal samples were taken and tested negative for PEDV RNA based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) described by Bertasio et al., 2016.

Collection of serum samples was performed in 17 Italian commercial pig farms between 2014 and 2015 after the PEDV outbreaks.

Thus, the ROC curves were calculated based on previous classification of the sera into positive and negative groups. The ROC curves permitted both to select the optimal cut-off values and to estimate the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. The shape and the relevant AUC values demonstrated the highly accuracy (AUC = 0.992 at the 1/4 dilution, 95% IC 0.983\u20130.997) of the competitive ELISA for anti-PEDV antibody detection, that has nearly 100% sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp).

A precise and rapid diagnosis of PEDV infection is important for the application of effective measures control viral dissemination and severity of the disease outbreaks, and thus reliable virological and serological diagnostic assays are needed. Rapid identification of PEDV and its differentiation from other enteric swine pathological agents are achieved by using virological assays, whereas serological tests provide useful information regarding past exposure to PEDV, prevalence of infection and epidemiology of the disease. The determination of PEDV-specific antibodies may also be used to evaluate sow immunity and/or presence of immunoglobulin in the colostrum, which might help to predict the level of specific protection in piglets.",

            "text": "In this investigation, a MAbs-based competitive ELISA for the detection of PEDV antibodies was developed in house and validated. Ideally, the diagnostic Sp and Se of a such test should be calculated using clearly true negative and true positive samples as defined by a combination of \u201cgold standard\u201d methods. In the present study, a ROC curve approach, considering different groups of pig sera obtained either from farms classified as PED-negative or -positive based on their history, presence of clinical signs and results of virological tests (Real-Time RT-PCR and antigenic ELISA), or from experimentally infected pigs, in which antibodies could be detected starting from 5 to 7 days post infection, was used to estimate the assay accuracy for the PEDV competitive ELISA. In particular, the diagnostic Se and Sp obtained by this validation study confirmed those obtained in a previous study (Sozzi et al. 2014), in which this competitive ELISA was evaluated by comparing it with the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). A total of 296 field serum samples taken from pigs in PEDV-exposed or unexposed Italian farms were used. Field samples were collected from finishing pig farms in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna 4 to 8 weeks after the beginning of the last wave of PED in Italy from 2005 to 2006. In those outbreaks, sequencing analysis of the S1 gene from Real-Time RT-PCR-positive faecal samples identified a G1a PEDV strain. The results obtained by the PEDV competitive ELISA presented a high correlation with those obtained by the IPMA test (i.e., a kappa score = 0.97), which indicates an almost full concordance between the two methods. According to the results obtained, to the cELISA for anti-PEDV antibody detection it could be attributed nearly 100% sensitivity (Se). However, we selected that cut-off value (60%) both easily applicable in routine activity and representing the optimal balance of Se (96.5) and Sp (97.69). The sensitivity of the test is therefore very high also in the case of infection due to the more recent PEDV strains belonging to S-INDEL group and it is likely not affected by genetic differences among circulating strains as already observed by Gerber et al. (2016) who sustained the capacity of the cELISA to correctly identified pigs infected with G1a, G1b and G2b PEDV.",
