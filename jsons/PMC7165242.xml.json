            "text": "Since December 2019, cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, new coronavirus pneumonia) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported [1]. The disease spreads rapidly and patients infected suffered from several complications [2,3]. The Technical Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Infection in Medical Institutions (First Edition) [4] points out that when medical personnel contact patients with COVID-19, they need to take protective measures such as contact isolation and airborne isolation. Intravenous infusion [5] is an important treatment method in the designated hospital for this epidemic. Nurses need to wear multiple layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) in isolation wards [6], including disposable caps, goggles, face shields, N95 masks, protective coveralls, disposable isolation gown, two layers of shoe covers, and at least two layers of latex gloves. Compared with working in general wards, their physical and mental burdens are greater [7], as such, difficulties in nursing operation increase, the time to perform the work is longer, work efficiency decreases, and patients\u2019 satisfaction decreases due to long waiting time for treatment. Process reengineering is a management idea put forward by Michael Hammer and Jame Champy of the United States. Its purpose is to improve overall work efficiency by optimizing the process. It has been applied to the management of various fields in China and other countries and has achieved good results [8,9]. Its core idea is to improve work efficiency and optimize productivity by reorganizing and optimizing the organization, composition, and operation steps in enterprise processes [10]. Its main approaches include equipment renewal, material substitution, step simplification, time sequence adjustment, etc. [10]. In process optimization and implementation, continuous improvement should be made to the process in order to obtain the best results. This theory has been applied to management by enterprises and has also achieved good results in hospital management, such as surgical management [11], ward-nursing operations [12,13], chronic-disease management [14], and others. To improve the efficiency of intravenous infusion treatment in the isolation ward, our hospital used reengineering theory to evaluate the intravenous infusion workflow, searched for the steps that could be improved, optimized the process, and achieved good results.",

Intravenous administration management is an important treatment method in hospitals, and its process optimization requires team cooperation. This research team consisted of a chief physician, a chief nurse, a head nurse of the isolation ward, an infection-control expert, and two responsible nursing-team leaders. Each step of the infusion workflow was evaluated to identify if it could be improved or not. Then, the optimized design was carried out, optimized process was formulated, nurses were organized for training, the status of process-operation was recorded, and supervision and feedback were incorporated into the process implementation.",

In 2016, China issued the Planning Outline of Healthy China 2030, which raises the improvement of nursing efficiency and service quality to the height of national strategic management [24]. In this study, the transfusion process was modified according to process reengineering theory, which improved the work efficiency. The core idea of this theory is to reorganize and optimize the organization, composition, and operation of the existing process, and to improve the overall work efficiency and increase income by means of equipment renewal, process simplification, and timing adjustment [10]. In this study, the medical-order processing and intravenous admixture were not performed in the isolation area, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) were provided to nurses, thus shortening the infusion working time and improving the overall infusion efficiency. The results showed that after optimization, the preparation time before intravenous admixture was shortened from 4.84 min to 3.50 min; the intravenous admixture time, from 4.03 min to 2.60 min; and the waiting time for each patient shortened. The possible reason was that when providing infusion treatment to patients with COVID-19, the nurses involved in the medical order processing step and intravenous admixture step after optimization did not need to wear heavy PPE; therefore, the influence on vision and hearing were reduced, and the degree of difficulty encountered was lesser than that noted previously. On the premise of ensuring the safety of patients, the overall drug preparation time was effectively shortened, patients were treated in time, and their satisfaction was also improved.",
