Up to 8 % of infants hospitalized with acute viral bronchiolitis required admission to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) owing to recurrent apnea or acute respiratory failure needing ventilatory support [5]. Currently, most PICU teams provide non-invasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) ventilation as the first-line therapy when required.",

Criteria for inclusion in the cohorts were admission in the PICU for severe acute bronchiolitis and acute respiratory failure or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related apnea events requiring ventilatory support, either in invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or nCPAP mode. Exclusion criteria included acute bronchiolitis stabilized with nasal oxygen supplementation only and patients with missing data.

The PCR viral status, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary radiologic abnormalities on chest X-ray were also included. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score was systematically calculated at both hospital and PICU admission, and was also collected. PICU stay data included measurements of maximum PCO2 and minimum SpO2/FiO2 ratio on the first day of admission. All invasive studies and access were collected, such as number of labs and chest X-rays during the PICU stay, and the need of central venous lines. Healthcare-associated pneumonia were based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) criteria and defined by new onset of fever (temperature >38.5 \u00b0C), new infiltrate(s) on chest X-ray, and positive tracheal aspirate culture when available.

Hospital admission rates in the USA and Europe are reported to be between 20 and 30 per 1,000 for children under 1 year [8\u201310]. PICU admission rates range from 4 to 15 % for healthy infants and this percentage increases accordingly with the presence of comorbidities [11]. The treatment of severe bronchiolitis is mainly supportive [12]. Invasive ventilation is still frequently used to support these infants, but it is associated with significant airway and infectious adverse events [13]. In observational studies, early use of nCPAP was associated with a significant decrease in both RR and PCO2, suggesting that nCPAP might be an effective ventilation strategy in moderate to severe bronchiolitis with a low rate of failure [14\u201320]. In addition, nCPAP failure does not seem to be associated with a worse evolution. Moreover, recent physiological studies demonstrated that severe bronchiolitis is associated with increased work of breathing, as reflected by high levels of diaphragmatic and esophageal pressure\u2013time products, and significantly improved with application of a continuous PEEP [7, 21, 22]. To our knowledge, this is the first study which clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic benefit of nCPAP in severe acute bronchiolitis. This large observational cohort study, with more than 300 cases of nCPAP, found that nCPAP is independently associated with a shorter duration of ventilatory support, PICU LOS, and hospital LOS. These findings confirm previous observational studies which showed a similar reduction in time of ventilatory support of 2\u20133 days [17, 18, 23].",

Bronchiolitis with fever has been associated with a lower risk of bacteremia (0.2 %) compared to children with a fever of unknown origin (2\u20137 %) [25]. Although antimicrobial therapy is no longer recommended for bronchiolitis, it is commonly used in hospitalized children, with a rate varying widely between 34 and 99 % [26, 27]. In addition, infants with bronchiolitis requiring invasive mechanical ventilation have high rates of bacterial co-infection varying from 21 to 26 % [28, 29] and Kneyber et al. [29] reported antibiotic usage reaching 95 % in these setting. In our series, the decrease in antibiotics use from 58 to 30 %, between the two periods, is partly due to increased physician awareness of the potential harmful effects of antibiotic selection pressure. Nevertheless, we could not exclude a relationship between increasing use of nCPAP as a standard of care and the decrease in healthcare-associated pneumonia from 24 to 10 % [26]. Similarly, in adults, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was shown to decrease significantly the rate of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia from 20 to 8 % [30]. This study highlights the fact that although there has been a change in the approach to ventilator support over time, there has also been a significant change in many aspects of the overall management of PICU patients between those two decades that can moderate the conclusion.",

In 2002, in the USA, bronchiolitis hospitalizations accounted for 21.1 % of children less than 1 year old with an annual direct medical cost of approximately $543 million. Younger age, male gender, mechanical ventilation, and co-diagnosis of pneumonia were all markers predictive of higher hospitalization cost and longer hospital LOS [31]. The use of NIV in adults with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease significantly increased between 1998 and 2008 and was associated with clinical improvement and decrease in LOS [32]. To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the economic impact of nCPAP in children. ICU admissions for severe bronchiolitis comprise only a small proportion of all bronchiolitis cases, but account for a larger proportion of all bronchiolitis-related hospitalization charges. In the USA, some authors demonstrate that bronchiolitis managed with invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with costs 6\u20139 times higher than when managed without any ventilatory support [33\u201335]. In this study, we further demonstrate that nCPAP is a cost-effective strategy with a trend to reduction of the total economic burden, mostly owing to a significant decrease in PICU and hospital LOS as actual individual costs could not be measured.",

The percentage of patients without any ventilatory support remains stable over the whole period, before the use of nCPAP and after the implementation of nCPAP as a pre-emptive ventilatory strategy in our unit (Fig. 1). This suggests that the nCPAP was not used for infants who in fact did not require any ventilatory support and allowed us to suggest that nCPAP is associated with a reduction of the total economic burden of severe bronchiolitis. We chose to analyze this effect in two different periods because, as shown in Fig. 1, invasive ventilation was exclusive before 2000 and nCPAP was predominant after 2006, whereas between 2000 and 2006 none of these support was predominant.",
