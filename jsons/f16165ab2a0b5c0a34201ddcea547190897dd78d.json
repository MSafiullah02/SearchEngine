Five aerosol characterization instruments were used to measure aerosols during 7 patient care activities: patient bathing, changing bed linens, pouring and flushing liquid waste, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, and nebulized medication administration (NMA). Each procedure was sampled 5 times. An SKC BioSampler was used for pathogen recovery. Bacterial cultures were performed on the sampling solution. Patients on contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms were selected for most activity sampling. Any patient undergoing bronchoscopy was eligible.",

For pathogens spread by contact or droplet, additional respiratory protection with a respirator is not considered necessary to protect healthcare personnel (HCP) from exposure [1] . However, concerns have been raised that some infections usually spread by contact or droplet routes could also be transmitted through aerosols generated during certain medical procedures. These concerns have been heightened during outbreaks of emerging infections such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and pandemic influenza. Some infection prevention guidelines therefore recommend that HCP use additional respiratory protection (eg, a fitted particulate respirator) when performing \"aerosol-generating procedures\" to protect themselves from exposure to infectious agents [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

No significant differences between the baseline and procedure measurements were observed for bathing, changing linens, pouring liquids into the hopper, flushing the hopper, and bronchoscopy without NMA. However, there was an increase in particle concentrations during NMA and during bronchoscopy procedures that started and ended with NMA. Bronchoscopy with NMA was associated with up to a 30 000 number/cm 3 increase in particle counts and a 1.5 mg/m 3 increase in particle mass, while NMA alone was associated with up to a 70 000 number/cm 3 increase in particle count and a 0.8 mg/m 3 increase in particle mass. However, as indicated by the error bars in Figure 1 , there was a high amount of variation in particle concentration among the NMA samples. Figure 2 presents particle number and mass concentration time-series data comparing baseline and procedure samples collected during bronchoscopy with NMA (Figure 2A and 2C) and NMA alone ( Figure 2B and 2D) . For samples collected during bronchoscopy with NMA, 2 narrow concentration peaks are observed, which correspond with the nebulized medication administration before and after the procedure. The samples collected during NMA alone demonstrate wider concentration peaks (when adjusted for the different time scales), as the nebulizer was running throughout the entire procedure, and higher particle counts but lower mass concentrations, indicative of smaller particle sizes. For the NMA alone procedures, baseline aerosol concentration levels were not reestablished until 10-20 minutes after the procedure had ended.",

This is consistent with the results presented in Figure 2 , which showed higher mass concentrations for bronchoscopy with NMA, as larger particles contribute more to mass concentration than do smaller particles. Because the nebulized particles are composed mainly of water, their sizes are largely affected by the nebulizing conditions (such as pressure and air flow rate) and time allowed for evaporation after they are emitted from the nebulizer [30] . It is therefore possible that the different particle sizes observed during the 2 types of procedures may be due to different air flow patterns in the rooms where the procedures were performed (some bronchoscopies were performed in negative pressure ventilation rooms, unlike those used for NMA). The particle size observations may also be influenced by different locations of the patient relative to air intake/outlet in the rooms, different NMA administration techniques (mask vs mouth piece), and whether albuterol was coadministered with another medication. Particle size distribution data for the other procedures evaluated in this study showed that pouring and flushing liquid waste in the hopper did produce a few aerosolized particles of approximately 1 \u03bcm (<0.5 number/cm 3 ); however, this peak was no longer discernible after 20 seconds, as particles most likely drifted, settled, or were carried away by convection. Changing linens also produced small amounts of particles of around 40 nm in size. Bathing patients produced a low concentration of 0.5-to 1.5-\u03bcm particles, possibly caused by the evaporation of chlorhexidine gluconate in the soap used for bathing. Figure 4 shows the difference between the average baseline and procedure measurements of the particle surface area that would deposit in the alveoli of the lung if inhaled. Bronchoscopy with NMA showed only a small elevation from baseline, whereas concentrations during NMA alone were much higher. No substantial elevation from baseline was observed during any of the other patient care activities that were sampled.",

The most common culture result was mixed gram-positive flora, with the most frequently isolated organisms being coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 12) and Micrococcus species (n = 6). Other organisms identified included viridans group Streptococcus, Bacillus species, Paenibacillus species, Corynebacterium species, and a non-meningitidis species of Neisseria. Twenty-five samples were collected during procedures involving patients who were on contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms (18 patients with VRE; 3 with C. difficile; 8 with MRSA; and 5 with MDROs).

The high particle concentrations are likely related to the use of a nebulizer during these procedures, and the particles are most likely aerosolized medication that escaped from the nebulizer device. This conclusion is supported by the results of a previous study, which evaluated droplet dispersion during nebulizer treatment and found an aerosol output profile consistent with nebulizer characteristics, rather than with dissemination of droplets from patients [36] . The extent of particle generation during NMA is probably related to the type of nebulizer used, treatment length, and patient characteristics, as a high amount of variability in particle concentration was observed during the different NMA sampling episodes. Although there was no significant bacterial pathogen recovery during NMA, the high concentrations of small aerosolized particles (median of 1 \u03bcm) could potentially affect HCP who administer the treatments.",
