The VGG first released vaccination guidelines for veterinarians in 2007 (Day et al. 2007) and these were updated in 2010 (Day et al. 2010). The 2010 revision was accompanied by a separate document providing information on vaccination for the owners and breeders of dogs and cats and by a series of infectious disease \u201cfact sheets\u201d designed to be used by veterinarians during an annual health check consultation (http://www.wsava.org/educational/vaccination-guidelines-group).",

The project, which was completed in late 2013, was born of the recognition that there are many unique political, educational and scientific challenges in the Asian countries that may not have been addressed specifically by the previous documents produced by the VGG. The present paper represents the final outcome from this Asian study. It summarises the key challenges faced by small companion animal veterinary practitioners in those parts of Asia studied (many of which may be extrapolated to other Asian countries) and makes a series of recommendations for future actions that might benefit the profession, pet owners and dogs and cats in these countries.",

Schultz) were joined by experts with first\u2010hand experience of the Asia\u2010Pacific region (H. Tsujimoto, R. Squires and U. Karkare). The principal aim of the project was to gather as much information concerning small companion animal practice, infectious disease and vaccination as possible, to form a firm basis for the recommendations to be made subsequently. To that end, in 2012 to 2013, the VGG undertook a series of fact\u2010finding visits to Japan (Tokyo and Osaka), India (Delhi and Mumbai), China (Beijing and Shanghai) and Thailand (Bangkok). Each of these visits was similarly structured and involved formal discussions with groups including (1) first opinion veterinary practitioners; (2) representatives of small animal veterinary associations and veterinary licensing boards; (3) veterinary academics teaching and conducting research in microbiology, immunology and companion animal medicine and the Deans of several veterinary schools; (4) government officials responsible for the assessment and licensing of small companion animal vaccines; and (5) representatives of international and national vaccine manufacturers and distributors. Given the importance of canine rabies in Asia, the VGG also met with the Deputy Director of the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in the Asia\u2010Pacific region, the Chairman of the Animal Welfare Board of India, and the founder of a major non\u2010governmental organisation undertaking a rabies control programme in Sri Lanka (the Blue Paw Trust). The formal meetings were supplemented with site visits to 12 small animal practices (of a range of size and standards) in India and China. Outwith these committee visits, during 2013, the Chair of the VGG (M. J. Day) also discussed vaccination policy with the small animal veterinary association of South Korea and spoke with practitioners during visits to Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia.",

Through these surveys, the VGG gathered information about (1) the responding practitioners, (2) veterinary practices and their diagnostic laboratory access, (3) canine and feline infectious diseases seen in the practices, and (4) canine and feline vaccines and vaccination protocols used in the practices. Responses to the surveys were excellent with data from 113 practitioners in Japan, 144 practitioners in India, 150 practitioners in China and 267 practitioners in Thailand.

At each event, the results of the local questionnaire survey were presented by a representative of a local practitioner association.

In India and China, veterinary schools are charged with providing practitioners to service the production animal industry and public health. Very little tuition related to small companion animal disease is provided and few academic staff have strong interest or expertise in small animal clinical studies. Therefore, practitioners working in this sector have largely gained their knowledge via postgraduate education. With the exception of some individuals who have worked abroad in other Asian countries or further afield, this postgraduate knowledge is largely gained from CE events provided by the veterinary associations. In Japan and Thailand, there is significantly greater development of small companion animal curricula, supported by well\u2010equipped teaching hospitals and designated academic staff; however, even in these countries, there are relatively few veterinary clinical specialists holding North American or European board certification, and the Asian Board of Veterinary Specialties, and associated speciality colleges, has only been established relatively recently. It was also notable that academics in the Japanese and Thai schools highlighted that there was less than optimal teaching of core clinical practice skills related to the client consultation and the delivery of vaccinations within that setting.",

            "text": "In the four countries visited, some common themes emerged concerning small companion animal infectious diseases. With the exception of canine rabies (which should be notified to the OIE, although it is widely recognised that gross under\u2010reporting occurs), there is little or no formal surveillance for small companion animal infectious diseases conducted by government, industry or academia. With some notable exceptions, particularly in Japan, there are very few academic staff who conduct research or publish in the area of small companion animal infectious diseases or vaccinology. This also means that practitioners in these countries have insufficient access to research\u2010led diagnostic laboratories that might help confirm diagnoses of infectious diseases in challenging, individual patients. Private diagnostic laboratories are also relatively uncommon in some countries; for example, an international group has only recently established the first veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Shanghai. In India, there are private laboratories only in Delhi and Mumbai. Many practitioners therefore rely on in\u2010practice diagnostic test kits, often manufactured in Asia, for detection of infectious agent antigen or antibody. The VGG identified few peer\u2010reviewed publications dealing with small companion animal infectious diseases and vaccinology that originated from India, China and Thailand. Some key manuscripts, brought to the attention of the VGG, are given as Appendix SELECTED KEY PAPERS HIGHLIGHTED TO THE VGG DURING MEETINGS. This situation, which is particularly acute in India and China, relates largely to two factors: (1) academics are not encouraged or supported to investigate diseases of small companion animals within institutions that have a production animal focus and (2) there are virtually no sources of research funding that might permit the investigation of small companion animal diseases.",

The disease has been eliminated in Japan and is rare in Thailand, but is still highly prevalent in India and, to a lesser extent, in China. There is a minimum estimate of 20,000 human deaths from rabies each year in India and the prevalence of disease relates to the challenges of controlling and vaccinating an estimated population of 25 million free\u2010roaming dogs in that country. The work of numerous NGOs working in various Asian countries has clearly shown that disease can be controlled where at least 70% of the free\u2010roaming dog population can be vaccinated, but this target has only been achieved in selected cities and regions. The veterinary practitioners met by the VGG in the various countries are all highly committed to the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection and many of them are actively engaged in pro\u2010bono vaccination within their own practice areas.",

In Japan and Thailand, academic teachers were also well informed about the guidelines and some had started to include the WSAVA recommendations in their teaching. However, most first opinion practitioners in India and China were unaware of the global trends for change in small companion animal vaccination practice. In all of the Asian countries visited, most practitioners continue to adhere to an annual revaccination programme in which all core and non\u2010core components are administered, often with multi\u2010component products containing numerous antigens. In part, this is reinforced by the erroneous belief that in areas of \u201chigh infectious disease pressure\u201d, individual animals may be better protected by more frequent administration of vaccines. Although practitioners understand the concept of \u201cherd immunity\u201d in the context of mass vaccination campaigns for the control of canine rabies, there is little sense that herd immunity applies also to other key infectious diseases.",

The first of these relates to the availability of vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of more than 1 year and the availability of product ranges that permit separate administration of core vaccines (no more frequently than every 3 years) and non\u2010core vaccines (annually where a risk\u2013benefit analysis deems that they are essential for the individual animal). In most Asian countries, vaccines are supplied by the major international companies and by national manufacturers. Most of the core vaccines produced by national manufacturers carry a 1\u2010year licensed DOI or lack a definitive description of DOI, as do the majority of international vaccines, despite the fact that the same international products in many other countries have a 3\u2010 or 4\u2010year licensed DOI.",

            "text": "The second major problem is that these issues are reinforced by the inflexibility of the national vaccine licensing authorities. In some countries, there appears to be a \u201cprotectionist\u201d approach whereby nationally produced products are permitted but the equivalent international vaccines are not allowed to be imported. The international suppliers have challenges in bringing their products to these countries, where licensing authorities often demand a new and country\u2010specific data package, including epidemiological evidence that a particular infectious disease exists and is of significant concern in the country. Generating such data is difficult in the absence of an appropriate research infrastructure (as discussed earlier). This situation is exemplified by the fact that there are currently no licensed feline vaccines available in India. This has necessitated individual practitioners or distributors sourcing foreign vaccine and importing it into the country. Similarly, in China, there is only one international feline core vaccine combination available on the market.",

This situation is particularly frustrating with respect to canine rabies vaccines. In many Asian countries, there is a legal requirement for annual rabies vaccination of dogs (but not cats) and this is sometimes linked to the registration of dogs. In a situation where a nationally produced vaccine with a 1\u2010year DOI is the only product available, this might be understandable; however, it is difficult to accept that international products, successfully used in triennial programmes in many other countries, must be administered annually to owned pet animals purely because of legal requirements.",

It is our belief that \u201cvaccine failure\u201d due to inappropriate storage or administration of products in the practice is common in some Asian countries and that this again reflects a lack of fundamental education in this area. In some countries, vaccines are transported long distances from the point of manufacture or importation to the veterinary practice. Most practitioners are well aware of the concept of the \u201ccold chain\u201d. However, practitioners may be too quick to blame a breakdown in the cold chain before delivery to the practice for vaccine failure and do not necessarily appreciate the monitoring measures that are put in place by the suppliers of international vaccines. The VGG has identified a number of practices related to vaccine storage and usage by practitioners, which have been highlighted in simple guidelines for correct vaccine husbandry (Table 3).",

Core vaccines are those that every dog or cat must receive as they protect the animal from prevalent diseases that may be lethal or induce significant morbidity. Non\u2010core vaccines are those that might be administered to individual animals whose geographical location or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting those particular infections. Non\u2010core vaccines are not required by every animal and should not be used where there is no evidence that the related disease exists in a country. The VGG also describes some vaccines as not recommended (where there is judged to be insufficient scientific evidence to justify their use). For individual\u2010owned pet animals in a domestic environment, the current WSAVA vaccination guidelines should be applied when quality\u2010assured MLV core vaccines are used in a practice. The VGG is unable to comment on whether nationally produced vaccines confer equivalent protection to those available internationally because of a lack of published, peer\u2010reviewed data.",

In areas of high infectious disease pressure, it is much more important to ensure that as many of the target population as possible are vaccinated (i.e. increase herd immunity) than to increase the frequency of vaccinations given to individual animals. With respect to international core MLV vaccines, key changes to current protocols would be introduction of a final puppy and kitten primary core vaccination at or after 16 weeks of age and revaccination of adult dogs and cats with MLV core vaccines no more frequently than every 3 years. The unnecessary annual use of international MLV core revaccination may be regarded as an inappropriate use of limited client financial resources that may be better applied to address other health issues in the pet. Even though the international products in most Asian countries do not carry datasheet recommendations for use in this way, it would be useful if local professional guidance permitted practitioners to use these products \u201coff label\u201d with informed client consent. This approach was used successfully for a number of years in other countries before datasheet recommendations were updated. As discussed earlier, the VGG hopes that in due course the international core MLV vaccines will have datasheet changes made in the Asian countries.",

In many countries, there is a limited range of international multi\u2010component canine vaccines incorporating both core and non\u2010core antigens, and where feline vaccines are available at all, the product range is similarly limited. Practitioners should begin to understand that while current datasheet recommendations for international MLV core vaccines recommend annual revaccination of adult animals, the same vaccines are given triennially in many other countries. Practitioners and their national associations should therefore continue to lobby industry and government regulators for changes that will bring recommendations concerning international products into line with current global standards and practices.

Again, practitioners and the national associations should be lobbying for changes that permit use of international rabies vaccines (that have a 3\u2010year licensed DOI in other countries) to individual pet animals every 3 years. In the case of mass vaccination campaigns, the VGG accepts the logic of annual revaccination of populations within which long\u2010term identification of individual vaccinated animals is impractical. In such free\u2010roaming populations, there is often high turnover of the animals, with new puppies being born and older dogs dying during the period between vaccination campaigns.

The annual health check concept is rapidly gaining popularity in many countries of the world, where it has been proven to be advantageous for the business of veterinary practice. There is no reason why this concept should not be equally well received by the affluent urban clients of Asian veterinary practitioners and the VGG would encourage the national associations to provide education in, and endorsement for, the concept. Even in a less affluent rural community, the small animal practitioner should consider aspects of nutrition and ecto\u2010 and endoparasite control at the same time as deciding on a vaccination protocol for the individual pet animal. In some parts of Asia, it has been observed that a high proportion of pups and kittens carry high parasitic burdens and that it would be a sensible approach to deal with these before vaccination, in order to achieve the greatest possible protective immune response following administration of a vaccine.",
