In order to minimize its impact, the risk factors should be quickly and accurately processed and eliminated after a public health emergency occurs, which puts higher requirements on the field detection technology.",

However, it is difficult to provide timely feedback because the transportation process and the testing process take a lot of time (Rongkard et al. 2016). Compared with conventional laboratory technology, POCT technology has the characteristics of fast detection, simple operation, and low requirements for instruments and operators, which is more suitable for application in public health events (Luppa et al. 2011). POCT technology can provide analytic results in the shortest time, providing important reference and evidence for relevant departments.",

Such methods cannot meet the need for rapid and accurate detection of pathogens in the field because of its long period and complicated operation. In addition, there are some other conventional detection methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which are faster than the gold standard method. However, these methods are also difficult to carry out in field conditions (Eriksson and Aspan 2007). The PCR method has been widely used in laboratories and hospitals. In order to detect the target gene of pathogens, it needs to extract and purify the genome in the sample first, and then detect the target gene with specific primers (Wisselink et al. 2017). The operation is complicated, and it takes 1\u20132 h to obtain the result. The colloidal gold based-immunoassay has the characteristics of low cost, simple operation, and rapid detection (within 15 min). It has been widely used as a rapid diagnostic tool, and is suitable for on-site detections. However, it is not sensitive and accurate enough, and it cannot provide quantitative result (Song et al. 2016).",

UPT-POCT technology uses UCPs as detecting labels, which has a unique up-conversion luminescence of emitting visible light (high energy) under the excitation of infrared light (low energy). This unique property makes it an excellent optic label with many advantages, such as no background interference, no quenching, and suitable for quantitative analysis. The development of UPT-POCT technology has obviously increased the sensitivity and stability of immunochromatography technology, and could complete quantitative detection with portable devices within 15 min (Hua et al. 2015).",
