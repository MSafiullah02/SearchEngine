Embryos were divided into three groups and were inoculated in the chorioallantoic sac with 0.2 mL of UNAM-97, Mass 41 IBV (positive control), or sterile PBS (negative control). Forty-eight hours later the allatoic fluid was taken and used to start a cycle of eight passages through 9d-old embryos. Seven days after the last passage, embryos were harvested and macroscopic lesions in all organs were recorded. Proventriculus and gizzard samples were obtained from all embryos and routinely processed for microscopic and ultrastructural examinations. The UNAM-97 IBV variant strain caused two macroscopic (",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by a RNA virus from the order Nidovirales (Mayo and Pringle, 1998) family Coronaviridae and genus Coronavirus. It is a highly transmissible virus. Morbidity can reach up to 100% in only 36 h. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes basically three pathologic entities. In young birds, IBV causes respiratory infection, which is often complicated with secondary bacterial infections. In adult hens, IBV causes a decrease in egg production and of internal and external egg quality. Finally, IBV causes renal damage in young and adult birds (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997) . Characteristically, frequent errors occur while the genetic information of IBV is being copied, resulting in antigenic and pathogenic variations (Steinhauer and Holland, 1986) . In the face of an outbreak, \uf6d92002 Poultry Science Association, Inc. Received for publication November 29, 2001 . Accepted for publication June 5, 2002. 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed: magdaescorcia@ yahoo.com. 1647 lesions uncommon for Mexican strains: thin-walled proventriculus and gizzard, as well as urate accumulation within an extra-embryonic peritoneal sac, leaving the body through the umbilical duct and accompanied by the yolk sac. At microscopic level, two relevant findings were observed to be produced by this variant. In the proventriculus, there was a decrease in the gland papillary branching, while the gizzard showed a significant reduction in mucosa thickness and tubular-to-proliferative-cell ratio, as well as an absence of hyaline secretion in the lumen. Electrodense material scattered in proventricular and gizzard cells was observed, with a structure consistent with that of coronaviruses. These pathological chicken embryo findings have not been reported as being caused by other IBV strains in Mexico. and given that various serotypes of the virus do not crossprotect, accurate serotype identification is essential to prevent further transmission (Muneer et al., 1988) . For many years, poultry producers have used biosecurity and vaccination as main preventive measures. During the last decade, the presence of the disease in IB-vaccinated flocks has been reported with increasing frequency in different parts of the world (Kusters et al., 1989; Gough et al., 1992; Cook, 1996; Cargill, 1998) . In Mexico, IB is one of the most common respiratory diseases. However, only the Massachusetts and Connecticut strains are officially authorized to vaccinate. Despite the use of these IBV vaccines, it is common to find IB problems in immunized chickens, causing a large economic impact. We have previously reported that IBV obtained from trachea, lung, kidney, and cecal tonsil of broiler chickens, and further characterized using the reverse transcriptase PCR and RFLP techniques, showed electrophoretic patterns different from other known IBV isolates (Escorcia et al., 2000) .",

Mucous membrane thickness was measured from lumen edge to juncture site of connective tissue with mucosal proliferative epithelial cells. 4 The tubule-forming cell layer-to-proliferative cell layer ratio was calculated. not enough information about the way these isolations emerged in Mexico, some investigators support the importance of the introduction of vaccines produced with strains from other countries (Kusters et al., 1989) . Similarly, although the use of attenuated vaccines reduces economic losses caused by IBV infection, it can also be responsible for the emergence of antigenic variants due to a recombination among vaccine and field strains (Muneer et al., 1988; Kusters et al., 1989; Keeler et al., 1998) . It would be important to perform an epidemiological study in order to know the prevalence of these strains in the Mexican Republic. Having no data regarding this, it is necessary to reinforce biosecurity measures that will allow the poultry system to restrict the shedding of this virus, and to determine whether the manufacturing of a specific vaccine against this new strain is justified. Newgeneration vaccine technology offers the possibility of using only some viral fractions instead of using the complete virus. This technology would offer the advantage of limiting virus recombination (Song et al., 1998) .",
