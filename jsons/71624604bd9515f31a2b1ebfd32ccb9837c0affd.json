Elevations of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been described in acute respiratory distress syndrome and in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy (2, 3) . Recently, a role for IL-6-driven inflammation in severe COVID-19 was suggested, as increased levels were associated with increased mortality (4) . Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-6 receptor and prevents signaling (5) , is used in inflammatory diseases and for treatment of CRS (6, 7) and has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 (8) .",

(9) reported improved inflammatory markers, oxygen requirements, and fever in 21 patients after tocilizumab treatment and concluded that it was an effective treatment in severe COVID-19. However, these patients were also treated with corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon-\u03b1, and ribavirin, making the effect of tocilizumab difficult to interpret. Further, only two patients required mechanical ventilation. Luo et al.'s (10) description of 15 patients treated with tocilizumab included a larger cohort of critically ill patients and more measured results, with 20% mortality and all remaining patients hospitalized at the time of the report.",

IL-6 testing was conducted at Mayo Clinic Laboratories (Rochester, MN) using an electrochemiluminescence assay. Baseline IL-6 values for two patients were obtained from a multi-cytokine panel (lower limit of detection [LOD] of 5.0 pg/mL); all others were from a standalone IL-6 assay (LOD 1.8 pg/ml). Disease severity was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 clinical status scale with minor modification (15). Descriptive statistics were calculated using JMP 15 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed in Prism 8 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA), and data was visualized using the tidyverse package in R 3.6.0 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).

Our cohort included higher rates of baseline hypertension (n=10/11, 91%) compared to Luo et al. (10) (n=9/15, 60%) and Xu et al. (9) (n=9/21, 43%), a majority were black/Latino (73%) and were overweight or obese (91%). We also observed substantially lower baseline IL-6 levels in our patients compared to those reported by both Xu et al. (9) and Luo et al.

Two patients in our cohort had low baseline IL-6 levels, one below the detection level, despite elevation in other markers of inflammation including CRP, raising questions about IL-6's role in the severe COVID-19 inflammatory state. Our findings demonstrate the challenge of defining CRS in the setting of COVID-19, given the lack of standardization across IL-6 assays and limited data to support IL-6 cut-offs for use of tocilizumab in patients presenting with severe infection.",
