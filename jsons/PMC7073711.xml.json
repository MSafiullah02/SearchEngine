The cause of the pneumonia cases was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, recently renamed as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease COVID-19). The first patient showing symptoms was recorded by Chinese authorities on 8 December 2019 [1]. On 9 January 2020, WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus had been isolated from one of the hospitalized persons [2], and the first death case was reported on the same day. The first case outside China was witnessed on 13 January in Thailand [3], and in the following days, several other countries also reported 2019-nCoV cases [4]. The first confirmed cases in China, but outside Hubei province, were reported on 19 January. [4]. As of 1 February, there were 14,628 confirmed cases worldwide (out of which 14,451 happened in China) with 305 total deaths [5].",

Beijing also announced the suspension of all inter-provincial bus and train services; several touristic attractions, including the Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland were closed [9].

With our baseline R0=2.6, disease control is achieved when more than 61.5% of potential transmissions are prevented.

This way, we evaluated the probability that a single infected individual is traveling from the index areas (in our case Chinese provinces other than Hubei) to a specific destination. Using a ten day interval for potential travel after exposure (just as in [15]), one can find from EpiRisk that in the January\u2013February periods, assuming usual travel volumes, there is a 1/554 probability that a single case will travel abroad and cause an exported case outside China. The dataset for relative importation risks of countries is available as well; thus, one can obtain the probability of an exported case appearing in a specific country. This probability is denoted by \u03b80, and we call it the baseline connectivity of that country with China. The baseline connectivity can be affected by other factors, such as the reduction in travel volume between the index and destination areas, exit screening in China, and the efficacy of entry screening at the destination country. Hence, we have a compound parameter, the actual connectivity \u03b8, which expresses the probability that a case in China outside Hubei will be eventually mixed into the population of the destination country. For example, the relative risk of Japan is 0.13343, meaning that 13.343% of all exportations are expected to appear in Japan. Thus, under normal circumstances, the probability that a case from China eventually ends up in Japan is 0.13343/554=2.41\u00d710\u22124 during the January\u2013February period [32]. Assuming a 20% reduction in travel volume between China and Japan, this baseline connectivity is reduced to a connectivity 0.8\u00d72.41\u00d710\u22124=1.928\u00d710\u22124. Additionally, assuming a 40% efficacy on entry screening [33], there is a 0.6 probability that an arriving case passes the screening, and the connectivity parameter is further reduced to 0.6\u00d71.928\u00d710\u22124=1.16\u00d710\u22124. If we assume interventions at the originating area, for example, exit screening with 25% efficacy, then our actual connectivity parameter is \u03b8=0.75\u00d71.16\u00d710\u22124=8.7\u00d710\u22125, which represents the probability that a case in China will eventually mix into the population in Japan. Assuming independence, this \u03b8, together with the cumulative cases C, generates a binomial distribution of importations that enter the population of a given country.",

These are incorporated into our transmission model influencing the cumulative number of cases C. The connectivity \u03b8 may be affected, for example, by exit screening at Chinese airports, entry screening at the destination airport, and a decline in travel volume, all of which decrease the probability that a case from China will enter the population of the destination country. The parameter Rloc is determined by the characteristics and the control measures of the destination country. As new measures are implemented, or there is a change in travel patterns, these parameters may change in time as well.",

            "text": "Cumulative cases and connectivity can be estimated, in general. However, to make a good assessment of the outbreak risk, it is very important to estimate Rloc in each country. In the absence of available transmission data, one may rely on the experiences from previous outbreaks, such as the detailed description in [35] of the reductions in the effective reproduction numbers for SARS due to various control measures. In this study, we used a range of Rloc values between the critical value 1 and the baseline R0=2.6. A further source of uncertainty is in the distribution of the generation time interval, since a different distribution gives a different outbreak risk even with the same Rloc. For our calculations, we used the distribution from [19] (see also [20]); a more in-depth discussion of this topic may be found in [36]. Knowing Rloc and the generation interval are needed not only to have a better quantitative risk estimation, but also for guidance as to which types of control measures may reduce the outbreak risk the most effectively.",
