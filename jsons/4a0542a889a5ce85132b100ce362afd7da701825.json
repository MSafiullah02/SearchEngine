In most cases, it is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To confirm AIP, histological confirmation is required (4). However, this likely leads to underdiagnosis of the condition, as respiratory failure is often prohibitive of lung biopsy. Our patient met the criteria for moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (5), but it was not possible to perform biopsy due to respiratory failure. Nevertheless, an extended panel of examinations did not show alternative diagnosis in a previously healthy patient, so a presumptive diagnosis of AIP was made. Moreover, secondary ARDS is often accompanied with multiorgan failure while this is seldom seen in AIP (6) . Known causes of DAD are infections, connective tissue diseases, drugs, aspiration, non-infectious complications of organ transplantation and oxygen toxicity (4).",

Clinical manifestations of COP can begin with a flu-like illness and often protracted dyspnoea, albeit there are also rapidly progressive cases. Because these symptoms are nonspecific, diagnosis is often delayed for more than 6 weeks (7). Most common chest X-ray and CT patterns of COP are multiple alveolar opacities (typical COP), solitary opacity (focal COP) and infiltrative opacities (infiltrative COP). Opacities are usually peripheral or peribronchial, patchy and asymmetric, with air bronchograms and with a tendency to migration (8) . In AIP there are typically diffuse ground-glass opacities with a mosaic pattern and alveolar consolidations. Changes are usually bibasilar, but may also involve other areas (8) . In a study of diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution CT for the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases, the diagnosis was correct in 79 % cases of COP and 65 % cases of AIP (9) . While in our case COP could not be ruled out completely, the rapid onset of the disease, radiological features and slow response to corticosteroids were more compatible with the diagnosis of AIP.",

Hemodynamic changes during exercise are thought to be the main cause -a theory supported by a documented fast resolution of oedema after the exercise (11) . On the other hand, mechanical stress or electrolyte disturbances may also play a role in some cases (10) . Strenuous exercise may influence the immune system.

Long-term survival is possible after recovery from AIP, with documented survival up to 2 to 4 years after diagnosis (4). Progression of pulmonary fibrosis was reported in most cases (4).",

There are no reports in the literature about the efficacy of this therapy in AIP.

It is also used in the treatment of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD). In CTD-ILD, MMF was associated with improvement in lung function (FVC and DLco) in patients with non-UIP HRCT pattern and with stabilisation of lung function in patients with UIP pattern (18) . Nonetheless, the efficacy of MMF needs to be confirmed in further studies. A recent small randomized placebo-controlled study that included patients with mild systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease did not confirm benefits of MMF over placebo (19) .",
