Infection control strategies aimed at preventing virus acquisition are especially important given that HSCT recipients with HPIV3 infection may experience prolonged (up to 4 months) [4, 5] or asymptomatic viral shedding [6] . Although ribavirin has been shown to be active against HPIV in vitro and in vivo, no controlled clinical trial (CCT) has established its efficacy in human HPIV disease [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . For this reason, prevention of virus acquisition and transmission remains paramount.",

All staff and visitors in these units are asked to adhere to strict hand hygiene procedures on entering the ward.

The layout of the OPC consists of a large waiting room, from which patients are directed to either a large open infusion center room or to 1 of 10 individual exam rooms. Before the study intervention, the patients were reminded by signs to practice hand hygiene, cover the mouth when coughing, and don a mask for respiratory viral symptoms; however, no organized, ongoing assessment of compliance with this practice was in place. Droplet precautions practiced in the outpatient setting before the investigation were usually limited to the patients who had obvious respiratory tract infections. Contact isolation was usually limited to patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Routine nasal swabs or washings for respiratory viral screening were not performed in patients with symptomatic respiratory illnesses before implementation of the intervention.",

All adult patients in the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) center between early August and September 30, who had signs and symptoms of URTI or LRTI in the outpatient setting, underwent detailed clinical evaluation, and samples were acquired from URT or LRT washings. Patients with LRTI with new pulmonary abnormalities on computed tomography scan underwent BAL. 2. In the OPC, patients and family members were asked to wash their hands and were screened for acute respiratory illness on entry to the OPC (see 3) . Symptomatic patients were immediately masked and placed in a private room with contact and droplet precautions, and a respiratory viral screening sample was obtained. Symptomatic family members were asked to remain in an area of the waiting room separate from the patients. 3. Detailed guidelines and scripts for phone and clinic triage were created for use by staff to question all patients, whether presenting by phone or in the clinic. Respiratory transmission information signs requesting that all patients, family members, and friends with respiratory symptoms should practice hand hygiene and don a mask immediately were posted just outside the clinic door, inside all outpatient units, and in the HSCT inpatient units. 4. Staff involved in patient care in the outpatient and inpatient settings were questioned about recent URTI or LRTI symptoms and signs. Adherence to the institutional ill-provider policy was made mandatory if any signs of URTI or LRTI were elicited. 5. Visitation by symptomatic family members was prohibited. 6. The decision whether to admit patients and treatment decisions were made by the HSCT provider team in consultation with the Infectious Diseases service. 7. Patients with documented HPIV3 were asked to adhere to strict hand hygiene policy, wear a mask for 1 month after active infection during all OPC visits, and were placed in private rooms for the same duration.",

Of the 3 patients with LRTI who were not treated with ribavirin, 1 died and 2 recovered. Finally, 1 patient was treated with ribavirin very early in the course of probable LRTI and recovered. Although not controlled, these data suggest no benefit to aerosolized ribavirin in treatment of patients with established LRTI and accentuate the critical need for interventions to prevent transmission and better therapeutic modalities. Well-designed clinical trials exploring this complicated area would be useful to help guide interventions, but this is likely unfeasible because of the relative infrequency of these events.

Prompt attention and focus on infection control interventions was associated with a rapid decrease in the number of incident cases. Policies and procedures addressing the approach to patients with respiratory viral illnesses in HSCT OPC populations should be formulated and reinforced with clinic staff to help prevent the spread of these infections. Given the possibility of asymptomatic or prolonged viral shedding of HPIV3, the paucity of documented effective treatment strategies, the high mortality, and the emergence of newly identified viral respiratory pathogens (eg, bocavirus, coronaviruses), such infection prevention policies should emphasize high vigilance and strict respiratory etiquette throughout the year. A larger prospective control study would be useful to better clarify the role of infection control practices for HPIV3 infection in HSCT recipients. ",
