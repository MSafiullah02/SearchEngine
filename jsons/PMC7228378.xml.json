Since it was first reported, a worldwide pandemic has ensued affecting more than 450 000 individuals as of March 2020. In the midst of the pandemic, epidemiological reports unveiled a disproportionate low rate of severe cases among adult females compared to adult males, 42% and 58%, respectively.\n1\n Similarly, the rate of severe cases among pre\u2010pubescent children was exceptionally low at 0.6%.\n1\n An explanation for the skewed prevalence of severe COVID\u201019 infection in adult males has yet to be elucidated.",

In addition, AR expression is low prior to pubertal maturation and may contribute to the low incidence of severe COVID\u201019 infection in children.6, 7, 8 As such, we propose that the lower rate of severe COVID\u201019 infection in female patients may be attributed to lower AR expression.9, 10\n",

SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is part of the coronavirus family of viruses including SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 and MERS\u2010CoV. Coronavirus predominantly infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung.\n11\n Previously, it was demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 cell entry depends on priming of a viral spike surface protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) present in the host.12, 13 In type II pneumocytes, TMPRSS2 expression is associated with an increase in AR expression,\n14\n specifically connecting AR expression to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, due to AR\u2010regulated TMPRSS2 gene promoter (Figure 1).\n15\n Moreover, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recognized as the attachment molecule to the viral spike surface protein, thus termed the \u201creceptor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u201d.\n16\n Interestingly, ACE2 has been shown to have reduced activity by the decrease of androgen hormones (experimental orchidectomy), possibly by decreased expression of ACE2.\n17\n\n",

In addition, analyzing ethnic variation in AR expression may predict COVID\u201019 ethnic mortality differences. Additionally, the activation of AR can be reduced by several classes of drugs including AR antagonists, androgen synthesis inhibitors, and antigonadotropins. For example, the FDA\u2010approved 5\u2010alpha reductase inhibitor finasteride demonstrated reduction of activation of AR in multiple tissues.\n10\n Other potential drugs that could be studied include: cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, chlormadinone acetate, spironolactone, medrogestone, oxendolone, osaterone, bifluranol acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, topilutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, nomegestrol acetate, promegestone, trimegestone, ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, seviteronel, aminoglutethimide, dutasteride, epristeride, alfaestradiol, and isotretinoin.
