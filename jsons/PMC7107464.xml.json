Beetles were reared in 1,000-ml wheat bran (Morrison Milling Co., Denton, TX) in plastic containers (15 by 15 by 30 cm) with screen tops and held at 30\u00b0C under a photoperiod of 8:16 (L:D) h. Additionally within each cage, a 6-cm2 sponge moistened with deionized water (dH2O) and a 0.5-cm-thick slice of a medium-sized apple were replenished twice per week, and 30 ml of fishmeal (Omega Protein, Inc., Hammond, LA) was added to the wheat bran once per week.",

To collect a sample of the resident bacteria present on the outer surface of the beetles before external disinfection (PRE-wash), each beetle was immersed in 1 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB; Difco, Sparks, MD) at room temperature. The beetle was removed and immediately subjected to one of the experimental disinfection protocols (see above). An aliquot of 0.1 ml of PRE-wash TSB was serially diluted, spread on blood agar plates (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Bacterial load, expressed as colony-forming units (CFU), was determined after an 18\u201324-h incubation. After each disinfection protocol was completed, surviving residual bacteria were sampled (POST-wash) by again immersing the beetle in 1 ml of TSB at room temperature. The beetle was removed, and an aliquot of 0.1 ml of POST-wash TSB was serially diluted, spread on blood agar plates, and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. CFU were determined after an 18\u201324-h incubation. To ensure detection of bacterial contamination below the plating threshold of 10 CFU, the remaining 0.9 ml of PRE-wash and POST-wash TSB was enriched by incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C (ENRICH). After incubation, an aliquot of 0.1 ml of TSB was spread on a blood agar plate and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The presence or absence of bacteria was recorded after 18\u201324-h incubation at 37\u00b0C. CFU data were analyzed by logistic regression and enrichment data were analyzed by exact logistic regression in PROC LOGISTIC (SAS Institute, Cary, NC; Agresti 2002).

The RiboPrinter microbial characterization system (Qualicon, Inc.) characterizes the 5, 16, and 23S rRNA and flanking regions of a bacterial sample by using specified restriction enzymes. The resulting rRNA pattern (RiboPrint pattern) was automatically characterized and identified by comparing the pattern to reference patterns in the bacterial database provided by Qualicon, Inc.

External disinfection using 95% EtOH followed by a dH2O rinse (protocol A), disinfected less than one-half of the beetles. However, allowing external surface evaporation after treatment with EtOH instead of immediately performing a dH2O rinse, significantly improved disinfection by 61% (protocol C versus A; P < 0.0001). Using 2% NaOCl/10% Tween 80 followed by a dH2O rinse (protocol D) disinfected slightly more than one-half of the beetles. Adding a 70% EtOH treatment to the protocol significantly improved disinfection by 36% (protocol E verses D; P < 0.0003). Removing the dH2O rinse completely and adding a higher strength 95% EtOH treatment, which was subsequently allowed to evaporate, also significantly improved disinfection by 40% (protocol F versus D; P < 0.002). Prior treatment of 95% EtOH with NaOCl/Tween 80 improved disinfection by 19% (protocol C versus F; P < 0.03). However, the addition of a second 95% EtOH treatment before the NaOCl/Tween 80 and 95% EtOH treatments did not significantly increase efficacy (protocol G verses F). A dH2O rinse to wet the beetle followed by 20% H2O2 (protocol H) disinfected almost all of the beetles. The substitution of a 95% EtOH, which was subsequently allowed to evaporate, before treatment with 20% H2O2 or 7.35% H2O2/0.23% peracetic acid, disinfected 100% of the beetles (protocols J and K).

M. luteus was also resistant to 70% EtOH and NaOCl washes, but it did not survive a 95% EtOH wash. Bacillus spp. and Enterobacter cloacae resisted sequential washing in dH2O and H2O2, but they were removed by sequential washing in 95% EtOH and H2O2.

However, validation of these sterilization methods was not presented. In this study, we tested the efficacy of disinfection protocols to remove culturable, aerobic bacteria from the external surface of A. diaperinus. The protocols were based on the use of three primary chemicals (EtOH, NaOCl, Tween 80, and H2O2), and the level of external disinfection was found to range from 48 to 100%. Sonication was used to assure uniformity of the agitation procedure for comparison of protocols. However, it should be noted that sonication has been reported to assist in the destruction of bacterial cells and thus could enhance the efficiency of the disinfection techniques used (Dehghani 2005).",

The reservoir competence of lesser mealworms for Salmonella and for E. coli was investigated by disinfection with dH2O followed by 70% EtOH and a second dH2O rinse (McAllister et al. 1994, 1996). Conclusions indicated that adult and larval A. diaperinus maintained a viable population of internal (homogenate) and external bacteria for a period of time sufficient to infect successive flocks of broiler chicks placed in the house. However, no data were presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the external disinfection procedure before homogenation. Our study indicates that this in an incomplete sterilization procedure. Gray et al. (1999) investigated the histerid beetle Carcinops pumilio (Erichson), measuring both surface and internal (homogenate) contamination after rinsing for 30 s in 95% EtOH followed by dH2O. These investigators concluded that bacteria were carried both externally and internally. However, no supporting data were presented to substantiate the disinfection procedure. In our study, disinfection with 95% EtOH followed by dH2O (protocol A) was only 48.52% effective. It is possible that if the surface disinfection procedures were insufficient, then bacteria harbored externally would be attributed to internal sources upon culturing of the insect homogenate.",

Commercial solutions, however, usually contain minute amounts of impurities, which can cause decomposition; therefore, stabilizers are sometimes added (Goor 1989, Hess 1995, CHEMINFO 2005). Concentrated H2O2 solutions can also react exothermically with solvents. Although H2O2 proved to be the best cleansing agent, its instability in pure form and exothermic reactivity at high concentrations made it problematic to use; therefore, we investigated a commercially available substitute. The substitute consisted of a less concentrated formulation of 7.35% H2O2 with the addition of 0.23% peracetic acid, a stabilizer, a surfactant and a corrosion inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that this formulation was as effective as 20% H2O2 treatment.",

The epicuticle consists of several layers, including a superficial wax or lipid layer of long-chain hydrocarbons and esters of fatty acids and alcohols (Chapman 1982a, Lockey 1988). This deterrent to desiccation also presumably diminishes the effectiveness of surface disinfection by H2O2 or NaOCl treatment due to its hydrophobic nature. We found that prior treatment with EtOH enhanced the efficacy H2O2 and NaOCl treatments. Because lipids are soluble in organic solvents, it is likely that EtOH treatment either diminished the waxy layer or wetted the exterior sufficiently to allow a subsequent agent improved access to the beetle surface and invaginations, and the microorganisms residing there.",

Although many of the bacterial disinfecting procedures examined cleaned >90% of the beetles, we endeavored to find a protocol that disinfected 100% of the insects. When investigating bacterial transfer, complete exoskeleton disinfection is important to discern conclusively an internal source of contamination. Several previously reported studies used protocols that purportedly disinfected the surface of beetles; however, we could find no data validating the efficacy of the described techniques. Although it is possible that the insects harbor bacterial organisms internally, insufficiently sterilized exoskeletons can contaminate subsequent homogenized specimens. Therefore, it would be unclear whether the bacteria being measured were actually being harbored internally. We found that a combination of treatment with 95% EtOH, allowed to evaporate, followed by a 20% H2O2 or 7.35% H2O2/0.23% peracetic acid wash removed all culturable, aerobic bacteria from the external surface of the adult lesser mealworms.",
