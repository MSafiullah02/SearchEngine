The Christ Hospital consensus CPG for performing TAVR during the moratorium on \"elective\" procedures include severe AS and Objective evidence for decline in LVEF However, apparent lack of consensus in professional society recommendations may prompt practice modification. After adopting a \"minimalist\" approach to TAVR 6 years ago, we maintained anesthesiologist presence during TAVR for the occasional conscience sedation (MAC) procedure requiring \"conversion\" to LMA or rarely, general anesthesia (GA). Of note, the American Society of Anesthesiologists COVID-19 FAQs document (coronavirus resources for anesthesiologists) suggests replacing MAC anesthesia for all TAVR patients (because of time delays in SARS CoV-2 testing) with planned, controlled endotracheal anesthetics. 2 This document questions: \"what should we do about MAC cases with an open airway,\" and answers: \"If dispersion of potentially contaminated exhaled gases from an open airway (e.g. MAC) is a risk, consider alternate anesthesia plans. Potential contamination of your workspace and the room should be considered. The safety of you and your colleagues is paramount.\" In this context, our anesthesiologists recommended conversion from MAC to GA for all TAVR",
