            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The disease is characterized by respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge. In young chickens severe respiratory distress may occur, while in layers respiratory distress, decrease in egg production, and loss of internal and shell quality of eggs are reported. Some strains of the virus cause severe kidney damage, urolithiasis and may be associated with high mortality. IB is a major health problem affecting the chicken industry in most countries of the world. Through the use of attenuated live as well as inactivated virus vaccines, economic losses due to this disease have been significantly reduced. However, IBV variants may continue to circulate among vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks and cause severe economic problems (reviewed by Cavanagh & Naqi, 2003).",

The genome of IBV contains an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 27.6 kb. The virion has three major virus-encoded structural proteins, namely the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The spikes of IBV are formed by post-translational cleavage into two polypeptide components, designated S1 and S2. The molecular identification of IBV is based mainly on analysis of the S1 protein gene.",

Usually, embryo mortality and dwarfing increase as the number of serial passages increases. Some field strains still caused no dwarfing on the third passage, while other methods could detect IBV using inoculated allantoic cells (reviewed by De Wit, 2000). Of the five IBV isolates in this study, they showed different adaptation to embryos. All the five IBV strains did not cause visible changes in the embryos in the first passage, and four of them caused dwarfing and death of the embryos on the second to fourth passages (Table 1). For one of the IBV isolates, LHI10, obvious changes in the inoculated embryos were observed in the 10th passage. This isolate may not grow well in chicken embryo and the virus titre may be minimal in the first several passages.",

Cumming (1962) reported an IB outbreak causing severe kidney lesion in chickens in Australia in the same year. From this time, various nephropathogenic strains of IBV have been identified throughout the world (reviewed by Meulemans & van der Berg, 1998). In China, nephropathogenic IBV strains of the Massachusetts genotype have isolated in rural chicken farms of Beijing (Li & Yang, 2001). In the present study, we isolated three IBV strains from H120-vaccinated flocks and two from non-vaccinated flocks of layer chickens that experienced nephropathogenic infection in four provinces of north China. Virulence studies showed that severe kidney lesions were observed in the dead chicks that had been inoculated with each of the five Chinese IBV isolates. It was reported that nephropathogenic IB occurred in Pennsylvania from 1997 to 2000 in commercial broiler-type and layer-type chicken flocks, with mortality as high as 20% (Ziegler et al., 2002). Similar mortality was also found in this study by inoculating 15-day-old specific pathogen free chickens with each of the five Chinese IBV isolates (Table 2). Although the results of this experiment were not a true reflection of the situation in the flocks that the five IBV strains came from, they confirmed that the five IBV isolates are nephropathogenic.",

This strikingly high identity implied a close genetic relationship and possibly indicated a common origin. Not more than 76% nucleotide and amino acid identity was shared between the five IBV isolates and three strains, Q1, T3, and J2, which were also isolated in China before 1999 (Yu et al., 2001). Isolates Q1, T3, and J2 were isolated from the proventricular tissues of infected chickens with a syndrome associated with lesions of alimentary and respiratory tracts. Unlike the IBV isolates in this study, nephropathogenic infections were not observed from chickens infected with those three IBV strains (Yu et al., 2001). In addition, nephropathogenic IBV strains that showed more than 99.1 and 97.8% nucleotide and amino acid identity with the S1 protein of standard IBV strain M41 were isolated in Beijing (Li & Yang, 2001). The S1 protein genes were also compared between the IBV strains isolated in this study and three Massachusetts-type IBV strains, M41, H52 and H120. The results showed that they had only 74 to 77% nucleotide and amino acid identity at the level of S1 protein gene and indicated that they belonged to different genotypes. On the basis of the genotype and pathogenicity, we can speculate that there were at least three different genotypes of IBV strains circulating in China.",

With the exception of the Massachusetts strain, a very interesting aspect of IBV epidemiology, as far as it is possible to know, is the presence and the spreading of the various IBV serotypes in different continents. About 20 emergent serotypes in North America did not spread to other continents. Similarly, the European, Australian, and Asiatic serotypes apparently did not spread elsewhere. In this study, the S1 protein genes of the five Chinese isolates were compared with two IBV strains, A1211 and A1171, which were isolated in Taiwan; one Japanese isolate, KB8523; three European isolates, UK/7/93, D274, and B1648; four American isolates, GA/2787/98, Connecticut, Beaudette, and Ark99. These IBV strains shared only 48 to 79% nucleotide and amino acid identity with the S1 protein of the five Chinese isolates. Obviously, they belonged to different genotypes. However, we cannot conclude that other IBV types are not present in China because the research on the matter is rather poor and it would be worthwhile to conduct more studies.",
