Despite divergent cells of origin and mechanisms of lymphomagenesis, management of PTCL has historically followed the treatment framework for aggressive B cell NHL, in part due to lack of understanding of subtype-specific disease pathogenesis, as well as difficulty of conducting dedicated prospective treatment studies. Although generally not curative with the exception of ALK+ ALCL, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) is the most commonly prescribed initial treatment for systemic PTCL. While autologous stem cell transplant may extend progression-free survival (PFS) for some patients, relapse remains common. Recent advances in the molecular and genetic bases of PTCL biology, as well as emergence of targeted therapeutic agents, have made it possible to envision personalized therapeutic progress.",

There is no characteristic immunophenotype for PTCL, NOS. T cell-associated antigens such as CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7 are variably expressed; one or more antigens such as CD5 or CD7 are frequently lost. Tumor cells can express either CD4 or CD8, with the majority expressing CD4. Clonal T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements are usually detected and mostly show alpha/beta T cell receptors (TCR beta positive). Gene expression profiles (GEPs) have identified two subgroups of PTCL, NOS, with distinct gene expression driven by the transcription factors TBX-21 or GATA-3, which promote differentiation of CD4+ T cells into TH1 and TH2 helper cells, respectively. The GATA3 subgroup was significantly associated with poor survival outcome [3, 4].",

            "text": "Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) is the second most common PTCL subtype and accounts for 24% of PTCL in the USA, with less incidence in Europe and Asia [2, 5]. There are three distinct forms of sALCL, including ALK-positive ALCL which has a peak incidence in children and young adults and is associated with translocations involving ALK gene located on chromosome 2p23, ALK-negative ALCL that typically presents in older adults, and the breast implant-associated ALK-negative sALCL. The immunophenotype of ALCL is notable for universal expression of CD30, frequent expression of TIA1, granzyme B, perforin, EMA, and low expression of CD8 and CD56. The majority of ALCL have clonally rearranged TCR genes, while roughly 10% in the null group have no rearrangement of TCR. Cytogenetic studies play a key role in ALCL diagnosis. ALK-positive ALCL most frequently has t(2;5) which fuses nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5q35 with the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23. NPM-ALK is an oncogenic tyrosine kinase which promotes signaling of JAK/STAT pathway. Less frequent variant ALK rearrangements include t(1;2) and t(2;3). In ALK-negative ALCL, recurrent chromosomal rearrangements involving the DUSP22-IRF4 locus on 6p25.3 were associated with favorable outcomes, while those involving TP53 homolog TP63 on 3q28 were associated with aggressive clinical behavior and poor outcomes [6]. Gene expression signatures of ALCL showed hyper-activation of STAT3 due to rearrangements of ALK tyrosine kinase or activating mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway.",

AITL is one of the more common PTCLs encountered in Western countries, accounting for ~ 28% PTCL in Europe, with lower incidence in North America and Asia (~ 15%) [7]. Patients typically present with advanced-stage disease and symptoms of a systemic illness such as rash, fever, and malaise. AITL can also manifest with immunologic abnormalities such as polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia or autoimmune cytopenias. The histology of AITL is characterized by a polymorphous infiltrate of immune cells with a prominent proliferation of high endothelial venules. The tumor cells express follicular T helper cell markers including CD10, CXCL13, PD-1, BCL6, and ICOS. Molecular studies show that T cell receptor genes are rearranged in 75 to 90% of cases, while immunoglobulin heavy chains may be rearranged in up to 25% due to expansion of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated immunoblastic B cell clones. Gene expression profiling demonstrates a molecular signature typical of follicular helper T cell origin [8, 9], with recurrent driver mutations in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, and RHOA, which are implicated in epigenetic regulation.",

Several clinical variants of ATLL have been described, including acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering. Peripheral blood smears from leukemia patients exhibit bizarre hyperlobated nuclei known as \u201cclover leaf\u201d or \u201cflower cells.\u201d For immunophenotype, the origin of the malignant cell in ATLL is an HTLV-I-infected memory CD4+ T lymphocyte which expresses CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD25 in most cases.

            "text": "CD30 is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family transmembrane receptor with restricted expression in activated T and B cells in normal lymphoid tissues [13]. Across PTCL subtypes, systemic ALCLs universally express CD30 in membrane and golgi patterns, while approximately 50% of non-ALCL subtypes, including PTCL, NOS, AITL, ENKTL, ATLL, EATL, and HSTL, express CD30 at variable levels. CD30 expression in PTCL suggests a CD30-mediated pathogenic mechanism for potential therapeutic targeting with brentuximab vedotin (BV), an antibody-drug conjugate that combines cytotoxic monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) with an anti-CD30 antibody [14]. The level of CD30 expression may not always be predictive of response to BV due in part to tumor heterogeneity, variation in detection and reporting of CD30 expression, and proposed secondary mechanisms of action. Single-agent BV given at 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles in 58 patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) sALCL showed overall response rate (ORR) of 86% with 57% complete response (CR) in a pivotal phase 2 study, leading to approval in the USA, EU, and Japan for R/R sALCL [15]. Responses in sALCL appear to be durable: 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 79% and 57%, respectively, in patients who achieved a CR. In patients who did not achieve a CR, the 5-year OS was 25% [15]. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) experienced by \u2265 10% of patients were neutropenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (14%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (12%). Overall, treatment was well tolerated. In non-ALCL, single-agent BV showed clinical antitumor activity in AITL and PTCL-NOS, with ORR of 41% (including 54% ORR in AITL with a median PFS of 6.7 months), although responses did not correlate with CD30 expression [16]. These results with single-agent BV paved the way for clinical development of BV-containing combinations in both relapsed and frontline settings.",

In addition to expression in most CD4+CD25+ ATLL, CCR4 is expressed in approximately 30\u201365% of PTCL tumor cells, including high expression (~ 65%) in ALK-negative ALCL, variable expression (30\u201340%) in PTCL/NOS, AITL, and transformed MF, while rarely expressed in ENKTL or ALK-positive ALCL [25]. Mogamulizumab (KW-0761) is a defucosylated, humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against CCR4 that has direct cytotoxic effect on CCR4-positive lymphoma cells via ADCC, as well as immunomodulatory potential by depletion of regulatory T cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Mogamulizumab is approved in Japan for R/R CCR4+ ATLL and CTCL and has been approved in the USA for R/R MF and Sezary syndrome. In 28 Japanese patients with CCR4+ R/R ATLL treated with mogamulizumab at 1.0 mg/kg intravenously once weekly for 8 weeks demonstrated ORR of 50% with 30% CR, and median PFS and OS of 5.2 and 13.7 months, respectively [26]. The most common AEs were hematologic events, pyrexia, and skin reactions, all of which were reversible and manageable.",

It was hypothesized that hypomethylating agents could be effective in TFH-derived PTCL given the abundance of recurrent TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH2 mutations. A retrospective French LYSA cohort study reported clinical outcome of 12 patients with R/R AITL (41% with associated myeloid neoplasms) treated with subcutaneous daily injection of 75 mg/m2 5-AZA for 7 consecutive days every 28-day cycle. The treatment appeared to be promising: ORR was 75% including 50% CR, median PFS was 15 months, and median OS was 21 months. Molecular studies revealed TET2 mutation in 100% of patients, 33% with DNMT3A mutations, 41% with RHOA mutations, and one patient with IDH2R172 mutation [38]. Currently, a global phase 3 study is ongoing to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety of oral azacitidine (CC486) to the investigator\u2019s single-agent choice of either romidepsin, bendamustine, or gemcitabine in patients with R/R AITL (NCT03593018).

            "text": "PD1 is a type I membrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is a member of the extended CD28/CTLA-4 family of immune checkpoint that guards against autoimmunity by downregulating the immune system and promoting self-tolerance [40]. PD-1 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells, and macrophages and negatively regulates immune responses broadly. PD1 binds two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In PTCL, PD-1 expression was detected in atypical T lymphoma cells in the majority of AITL (> 90%), to a lesser extent in PTCL/NOS (30\u201360%), and rarely in other subtypes [41]. In AITL, both PD1 and CXCL13, a chemokine promoting B cell migration and survival in lymph node, showed a similar expression frequency highlighting follicular helper T cells (TFH) [42], which may share additional TFH markers including CD10, BCL6, and ICOS [43]. In NKTCL, PD-L1 expression in NK/T cell lymphoma cells ranged from 56 to 93% in various studies, while PD-1 level was low [44]. In ATLL, PD-L1 amplification was shown as a strong genetic predictor in both aggressive and indolent ATLL [45]. Anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade strategy has generated mixed results in PTCL to date due to the complexity that malignant T cell lymphoma cells can express PD-1. In such instances, immune checkpoint blockade has the potential to accelerate tumor growth in tumor cells with high PD-1 expression, as proposed in murine studies [46]. ATLL patients treated with nivolumab developed rapid disease progression after 1 cycle of nivolumab treatment [47], cautioning against the use of immune checkpoint blockade in ATLL without further understanding the complex mechanism of immune evasion and activation. In other subtypes, responses have been mixed. In patients with R/R T cell lymphoma, single-agent nivolumab produced ORR of 40% [48], while PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab showed high efficacy (100% ORR, 71% CR) in a case series of 7 R/R EBV-associated NK and T cell lymphoma [49]. A phase II multicenter trial of patients with R/R PTCL who were treated with pembrolizumab was halted early after a preplanned interim futility analysis [49]. Nevertheless, several trials are ongoing to further explore the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in PTCL. Pembrolizumab is being added to romidepsin (NCT03278782) and pralatrexate (NCT03598998) in ongoing phase I/II trials in patients with R/R PTCL. Pembrolizumab is also being combined with pralatrexate and the epigenic modifier decitabine in an ongoing phase I trial (NCT03240211). The PD-1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab is being studied alone and in combination with lenalidomide in patients with R/R PTCL and CTCL (NCT03011814) as well as in combination with pralatrexate, romidepsin, and/or azacitdine (NCT03161223). The novel PD-1 monoclonal antibodies avelumab (NCT03046953) and tislelizumab (NCT03493451) are being evaluated in R/R PTCL and R/R mature NK and T cell lymphomas, respectively.",

Specifically, inhibition of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 isoforms blocks mitogenic and survival within tumor cells, disrupts interaction with the tumor microenvironment, and restores antitumor immune responses. The PI3K \u03b4/\u03b3 inhibitor duvelisib was evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation trial in 16 patients with R/R PTCL at a MTD of 75 mg twice daily on a 28-day cycle where it resulted in a 50% ORR with 3 CRs. The median PFS was 8.3 months, with activity demonstrated across a number of subtypes [56], and a phase II trial is underway (NCT03372057). Duvelasib is also being studied in combination with romidepsin and bortezomib in a parallel phase I study in patients with PTCL and CTCL. Duvelasib is given at 75 mg twice daily on days 1\u201328 on 28-day cycles with either romidepsin 10 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 (arm A) or with bortezomib 1 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 (arm B) [56, 57]. These combinations show activity with ORR and CR rates of 55% and 27% for patients with PTCL treated on arm A, and 36% and 21%, respectively, in patients treated on arm B. The median PFS and OS were 8.8 months and 9.1 months for PTCL patients on arm A and 3.5 months and 9.3 months for patients on arm B. Of note, 65% of patients treated on arm A experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) with neutropenia (18%) and elevated transaminases (15%) being the most frequent. Among patients treated on arm B, 45% experienced grade 3 or higher AEs with neutropenia (18%) occurring in more than 10% of patients. A phase IB dose-escalation study is being planned to examine the combination of romidepsin with the PI3K \u03b1/\u03b4 inhibitor copanlisib (NCT04233697).

BV-CHP was associated with higher CR rate (68% vs 56%, p = 0.0066) and superior survival. Median PFS was 48.2 months in the BV-CHP group, significantly improved compared to 20.8 months in the CHOP group. In addition, BV-CHP reduced the risk of death by 34% compared with CHOP. Adverse events, including febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy, were similar between groups. ECHELON-2 is the first randomized phase 3 study establishing the superiority of BV-CHP over CHOP in untreated PTCL, which led to FDA approval in November 2018 of BV-CHP as frontline therapy for CD30-positive PTCL. Although the ECHELON-2 study included non-ALCL cases such as PTCL-NOS, AITL, ATLL, and EATL (~ 30% enrollment, 136 total), their small sample sizes precluded sufficient power analysis.",

The EZH1/2 inhibitor DS-3201b has demonstrated in vitro anti-tumor activity in lymphoma cell lines and is being investigated in a phase I trial of patients with R/R PTCL (NCT02732275). The IDH2 inhibitor AG-221 is being studied in patients with advanced solid tumors or gliomas or R/R AITL who harbor these mutations (NCT02273739). An ongoing phase II trial is being conducted to explore the efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with R/R lymphoma, including PTCL (NCT01431209). Alternative JAK inhibitors are also being investigated including AZD4205 (NCT04105010). The dual SYK/JAK inhibitor cerdulatinib is under evaluation in a phase I/II trial in patients with R/R CLL or NHL, including PTCL (NCT01994382). The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has been approved for use in B cell lymphoma such as CLL and is now being investigated in an ongoing phase II trial in patients with BCL-2-positive TCL, including AITL and TFH origin PTCL (NCT03552692). Tipifarnib, a potent and selective inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, has been shown to modulate CXCL12 signaling pathway and has demonstrated promising preliminary results in patients with R/R AITL and CXCL12+ PTCL with ORR of 45% and a 73% clinical benefit rate [83] in a phase II trial in patients with R/R PTCL (NCT02464228). Engaging the tumor microenvironment remains an attractive approach in PTCL, and various novel strategies are under investigation. ICOS, an important member of the CD28/CTLA-4 family found on TFH cells, is being targeted with the monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 in an ongoing phase I trial in patients with PTCL follicular variant and AITL (NCT02520791).
