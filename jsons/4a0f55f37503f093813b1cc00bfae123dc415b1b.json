As of April 15, 2020, more than 1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including more than 120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The daily prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the WHO website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.

Anastassopoulou et al. (2020) studied on the estimation of the critical epidemiological parameters as well as the modelling and predicting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020).

The ARIMA model can be modified to perform the function of an ARMA model as well as a simple AR, I or MA model. AR (p) model refers to the current value of the time series linearly in terms of its previous values \u22121 , \u22122 ,.., \u2212 and the current residuals .MA (q) model refers to the current value of the time series linearly in terms of its current and previous residual series \u22121 , \u22122 ,.., \u2212 . The general formula of AR (p) and MA (q) models can be expressed in Eq. (1,2), respectively. \u03b8 are the autoregressive and moving average parameters, respectively. Y t is the observed value at time t and \u03b5 t is the value of the random shock at time t. It is assumed to be independently and identically distributed with a mean of 0 and a constant variance of \u03c3 2 . ARMA(p,q) model is composed of AR and MA models, in which the current value of the time series is defined linearly in terms of its previous values as well as current and previous residual series. The ARMA(p,q) model can be presented as given in the Eq. is a constant, \u22121 is the value of the previous random shock. The ARIMA model deals with non-stationary time series. The differenced stationary time series can be modelled as an ARMA model to perform the ARIMA model(He and Tao, 2018).2.3. Model selectionThe accuracy of a model can be tested by comparing the actual values with the predicted values. In this study, three performance criteria, namely Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were applied to test the predictive accuracy of the developed ARIMA models. They are expressed mathematically in Eqs. the observed value at time point t, is the difference between the observed and estimated values. Also, n is the number of time points. Lower RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values indicate a better fit of the data. All analyses were performed using STATGRAPHICS Centurion XVI. I software with a statistically significant level of p < 0.05.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Forecasting the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic using the ARIMA modelThe ARIMA modelling procedure is composed of four iterative steps: assessment of the model, estimation of parameters, diagnostic checking, and prediction. The first step of the ARIMA model is to control whether the time series is stationary and seasonal. A time series is considered as stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation are constant over time. The stationary of a time series observation is important as it will make it easier to get accurate estimates(Elevli et al., 2016). Timeseries plot, Autocorrelation Function (ACF), and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) graphs were constructed to check the seasonality and stationarity. The ACF graph determines whether previous values in the series are related to the following values. The PACF graph finds out the degree of correlation between a variable and a lag of the said variable that is not explained by correlation at all loworder lags(He and Tao, 2018). Estimated autocorrelations for the time series of Italy, Spain, and France are shown inFig. 2. Straight lines on the graph are two standard deviations limits and allow to detect non-zero correlations. Bars that extend beyond the lines show statistically significant autocorrelations for the COVID-19 data.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Italy, Spain, and France.
