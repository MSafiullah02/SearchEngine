A total of 12 enzymes were studied. The isoenzymes and antigens were electrophoretically separated on polyacrylamide gradient gels, and the patterns obtained were compared after appropriate staining for particular enzymes and reactivities with homologous and heterologous rabbit anti-Acanthamoeba antisera. One o f the human strains (CDC: 1283:V013) was identified as A . healyi n. sp. because o f its unique isoenzyme profiles for 11 of the 12 enzymes tested. The other human isolate was reidentified as A. culbertsoni because its isoenzyme profiles for 10 o f 12 enzymes resembled those of A. culbertsoni, Lilly A-1 strain. Since the isoenzyme profiles and the antigenic patterns of the fish isolate as well were remarkably similar to those of A. royreba, it was considered as a strain of A. royreba. Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis appears to be a powerful technique for the study of isoenzymes and antigens ofAcanthamoeba.",

During the last decade, these amebae have been isolated with increasing frequency from contact lens paraphernalia as well as from human tissue such as corneal scrapings and the central nervous system [9, 22] . Acanthamoeba can be readily recognized because of the striking morphologic characteristics of the trophozoites and cysts. Based on the size and morphologic features of cysts, Pussard & Pons [ 151 established 18 species and placed them in three groups. Group 1 now consists offour species (A. astronyxis, A. comandoni, A. echinulata, and A. tubiashi) characterized by large trophozoites and cysts (2 18 pm) [ 14, 191 . Species in groups 2 and 3 are smaller ( 5 18 pm) but can be separated from each other on the basis of cyst morphology. Group [14, 191. Although cyst characteristics make genus identification easy, differentiation to the species level is difficult. This is especially true for members of groups 2 and 3 which cannot always be identified by species on a morphologic basis alone. As a result, the most recent identification attempts have been based on both morphologic and biochemical criteria such as isoenzymes, antigens, protein profiles, and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis of DNA resolved by electrophoretic methods [2, 6, 14, 191 . Cladistic analysis of the data has also been used to elucidate the affinities of the various species of Acanthamoeba [4] .",

Unstained molecular weight standards, a 1:l mixture of high molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) and low molecular weight standards (Pharmacia) were used to calibrate relative molecular weights of the resolved bands. For immunoblots, 0.5 pl/mm of prestained protein standards (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was also used. A constant current of 7.5 mA per gel was applied during the first 20 rnin and then increased to 15 mA per gel. Voltage was allowed to float, and the wattage was limited to 25 W per gel. The power was turned off after 1 h and 30 rnin of electrophoresis, 15 rnin after the tracking dye migrated away from the gel. A constant temperature of 4\" C for enzymes and 7\" C for SDS-treated proteins was maintained during electrophoresis.",

SDS-PAGGE and silver staining of proteins extracted from whole trophozoites revealed very complex profiles, with multiple major bands ranging from 14.4 to 200 kDa for each of the 13 strains examined (Fig. 4A) . Despite the overall similarity noticed in the protein profiles of the 13 strains, members of group 1 could be easily distinguished from those of the other two groups. For example, members of groups 2 and 3 had a dense, dark staining band at about 44-46 kDa which was either absent or faint in group 1 organisms. Further, group 3 as well as A. castellanii had multiple dark staining bands in the region between 25 and 100 kDa that were either faint or not present in group 1 species. The most similar silver-stained protein profiles were those for A. palestinensis-A. pustulosa. those for A. royreba and CDC-FISH-SK in group 3 and those for A. tubiashi-A. comandoni-A. echinulata in group 1. Acanthamoeba astronyxis (group 1) and A. castellani (group 2) each presented remarkably unique profiles. A careful analysis ofthe silver-stained gel revealed that many of the strains possessed unique bands, e.g. A. healyi at 146. Immunoblot assays. Figure 4B-7 show the immunoblot patterns obtained when the separated Acanthamoeba polypeptides were reacted with rabbit antisera to A. palestinensis (Fig. 4B) , '4. culbertsoni (Fig. 5A) , A . royreba (Fig. SB) , A. healyi n. sp. (Fig. 6A) , A. astronyxis (Fig. 6B) , A. castellanii (Fig. 7A) , and A. comandoni (Fig. 7B) . Hyperimmune rabbit antisera reacted extensively with the polypeptides of each of the 13 strains studied; however, the reactivity was most prominent in the homologous extracts. Major antigens were detected between 20 and 116.5 kDa. In these homologous reactions, the staining intensity was so great that some individual bands could not be easily distinguished in the photographs (Fig. 4-7) . It is obvious from these studies that sera made against the group 3 species reacted extensively with the polypeptides of group 3 organisms, whereas they reacted moderately with those of A. castellanii (lane 8 ) and very little with the polypeptides of group 1 species. Only A. astronyxis (lane 9), among the group 1 species, appeared to react moderately with the group 3 and group 2 antisera. Conversely, sera made against group 1 species reacted prominantly with the antigens of group 1 organisms and sparsely with those of group 2 and group 3 organisms. All four species of group 1 produced a characteristic dense, dark staining band at about 30 kDa when reacted with the anti-A. astronyxis and anti-A . comandoni sera. Anti-A. castellanii serum reacted much more . AS a result, etiologic agents are being isolated with increasing frequency. Since it is not always possible to identify the infective agent to the species level by morphologic criteria alone, other nonmorphologic criteria need to be used. Isoenzyme electrophoresis is one such nonrnorphologic trait that has been used by others [3, 6, 251 . We have found that, for native proteins, high-resolution PAGGE appears to be a useful technique for The differences we observed in the separated proteins strongly support the existence of the three morphologic groups, as reported before [7, 15, 191. Further, the immunoblot profiles clearly indicate that group 1 species share only a few antigens with those of group 2 and group 3 species and hence are distinctly different from them. However, A. castellanii, a representative of group 2, shares a considerable number of antigens with those of group 3 species (Fig. 4B-6A ) but few with those of group 1 species (Fig. 6A , 7B) indicating closer relationship with the group 3 strains rather than group 1 species.",

Our more detailed study involving morphologic, enzymatic, and antigenic parameters clearly indicates that although this strain bears some morphologic resemblance to A. palestinensis, it is nevertheless very different from A. palesti-nensis and from all other species of Acanthamoeba. Hence it has been designated A. healyi, a new species. CDC:0884:V02 1, the human brain isolate that was previously identified as A. culbertsoni [23] , has been confirmed as A. cul- Fig. 6 .

Costas and Griffiths [3] also differentiated the two based on their ES and ACP profiles. Further, in reactions with the anti A. palestinensis serum in the immunoblot assay (Fig. 4B ) distinct differences were noted in the antigenic pattern of A. pustulosa from that of A. paleststinensis.
