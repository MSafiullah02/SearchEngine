            "text": "EMMPRIN is a cell\u2010surface\u2010glycosylated TM protein that belongs to the Ig superfamily. It was first discovered in a lung cancer cell line, where it stimulated the production of collagenase (MMP\u20101) in adjacent fibroblastic cells [1]; thus, it was first designated as a tumor cell\u2010derived collagenase stimulatory factor [1, 2]. Other names now include CD147, basigin, and HAb18G. Although studied most extensively in tumor biology, the role of EMMPRIN in normal cell function and other disease states has been investigated. EMMPRIN levels are up\u2010regulated and/or involved in diseases, including lung\u2010injury models, ischemic myocardial injury, atherosclerosis, cancer, SLE, GVHD, RA, MS, and pathogenic invasion, among other insults. In this review, we introduce the biochemistry of EMMPRIN, evaluate its multiple functions in T cells, and discuss its roles in immunologic disorders.",

            "text": "EMMPRIN is a 269 aa TM protein with a nonglycosylated molecular weight of \u223c27 kDa and a glycosylated molecular weight with an approximate range of 43\u201366 kDa [3]. Glycosylation patterns may vary in different organs or cell types [3, 4\u20135] and may be a reason for its multiple physiologic roles. The structure of EMMPRIN consists of a heavily glycosylated EC domain, a TM domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (\nFig. 1\n). There are 4 isoforms of EMMPRIN that differ only in its EC domain [6, 7]. The EC domain of the most prominent isoform, basigin\u20102 and here forward called EMMPRIN, is comprised of 2 Ig\u2010like loops (EC1 and EC2) held together by disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). Sequence analyses and the crystal structure of EMMPRIN demonstrated that the EC1, the more N\u2010terminal portion, structurally resembles the \u03b2\u2010strand pattern of the C region of Igs, particularly the C2\u2010set fold, a subclass that has some structural features of the V region of Igs in addition to the C region. EC2, the C\u2010terminal loop, is slightly longer and showed strong homology to the V region of Igs, thus termed as a shortened V\u2010set fold or an I\u2010set [8, 9]. EMMPRIN is unique among Igs, as its EC2 domain has a high degree of homology to the V region of Igs as well as the MHCII \u03b2 chain that contains a C region. For this reason, it is suggested that the EMMPRIN Ig domain may be a primordial form of the Ig superfamily [9, 10]. The C2\u2013V/I arrangement of the EC portion of EMMPRIN is also distinctive among Igs, as most follow a V/I\u2013C arrangement and undergo V\u2013V or I\u2013I dimerization [8]. Instead, the EC domain of EMMPRIN appears to undergo C2\u2013C2 or C2\u2013V/I dimerization based on the crystal structure [8]. As inferred, the Ig superfamily, which encompass the most diverse group of receptors known, contains domains that share evolutionary homology and are identified to be associated with functions, such as adhesion, migration, cell recognition, and T cell activation [11, 12], which EMMPRIN clearly exemplifies (as mentioned below). The complexity of EMMPRIN, in terms of its various glycosylation patterns, and types of homo/heterophilic interactions between domains all contribute to its multifunctional nature. A rare isoform also exists, expressed only in the retina, comprised of 3 Ig\u2010like loops and named basigin\u20101 [13]. Other rare and less understood variants include basigin\u20103 and \u20104, both comprising only 1 Ig\u2010like loop in which the EC domain of basigin\u20104 is slightly extended from that of basigin\u20103 [6]. Interestingly, basigin\u20103 was found to act as an inhibitor of EMMPRIN (basigin\u20102) likely by hetero\u2010oligomerization [7]. This was demonstrated in HCC cells, where in contrast to basigin\u20102, basigin\u20103 overexpression inhibited cellular proliferation, MMP induction, and invasion [7]. A highly conserved glutamic acid residue and leucine zipper are found in the TM domain and hypothesized to interact with a number of yet\u2010unidentified proteins in the plasma membrane. Although the cytoplasmic tail is short (only \u223c40 aa), this does not rule out the involvement of EMMPRIN in the initiation of various signaling pathways, even as a coreceptor. The TM and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved among species [14], thus emphasizing a critical, functional role in this region of EMMPRIN. A 22 kDa soluble form of EMMPRIN can be shed from the cell surface by MMP\u201014, cleaving off the first Ig\u2010like domain [15]. In addition, full\u2010length EMMPRIN can be released by cells via microvesicle shedding, an efficient vehicle to elicit communication between cells [16, 17]. It is reasoned that the outward budding of EMMPRIN\u2010containing microvesicles from the plasma membrane of tumor cells shortly after breaks apart, giving rise to membrane fragment\u2010associated EMMPRIN in the EC space; it is this soluble form (not the microvesicle\u2010associated form) that primarily induced MMP activities in stromal cells [16]. Since then, studies have described the involvement of EMMPRIN\u2010containing microvesicles in aspects, such as angiogenesis [18] and the migration and invasion of cancer cells [19, 20].",

            "text": "Each domain of EMMPRIN has been identified to interact with different proteins and correspond to particular functions, such that mAbs toward EMMPRIN may alter 1 function without affecting another. Importantly, N\u2010linked glycosylation of asparagine residues and homophilic interactions is significant for the function and protein interactions of EMMPRIN [3, 4, 8]; this was demonstrated when purified, deglycosylated EMMPRIN failed to induce MMP\u20101 and MMP\u20102 activity in tumor cells [5]. The EC1 domain of EMMPRIN is important in MMP induction (MMP\u20101, \u20102, \u20103, and \u20109, as well as MT1\u2010MMP and MT2\u2010MMP), oligomerization, the binding of integrins, and likely CD98 (a single TM glycoprotein involved in adhesion and amino acid transport; Fig. 1) [14, 21]. The EC2 domain has been described to bind cyclophilins (important in chemotaxis and adhesion) [14] and caveolin\u20101 (a negative regulator that binds EMMPRIN at its low glycosylated form, preventing its glycosylation and clustering at the cell surface; Fig. 1) [4]. The TM domain binds cyclophilin 60 (serving to chaperone EMMPRIN up to the cell surface) [22] and likely involves interactions with CD43 (an adhesion molecule) [23], syndecan\u20101 (a HSPG involved in adhesion) [24], and \u03b21 integrins [14] (Fig. 1). Lastly, both the TM and the cytoplasmic domain of EMMPRIN interact with MCTs [25], such as MCT1 or MCT4 (both widely expressed) or MCT3 (predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium). EMMPRIN shuttles MCTs to the plasma membrane, where it plays essential metabolic roles through the transport of monocarboxylates, such as pyruvate and lactate [2, 14] (Fig. 1). Other EMMPRIN\u2010interacting proteins include glycoprotein VI (involved in platelet rolling) [26], annexin II (implicated in cytoskeleton rearrangement) [27], shrew1 (influencing cell invasiveness) [28], and the \u03b3\u2010secretase complex (implicated in Alzheimer's disease in the production of amyloid \u03b2 peptides) [29].",

Although no gross abnormalities were observed histologically, these mice exhibited neurologic deficits associated with decreased sensitivity to irritating odors [30] and light as a result of blindness [31, 32\u201333], hypersensitivity to electric foot shock, as well as deficits in learning and memory [34]. These abnormalities appeared to correlate with the subregions of the mouse brain shown to express EMMPRIN [35]. No abnormalities were found at the BBB in the mutant mice, even though EMMPRIN is expressed on endothelial vessels in the CNS [30, 34]. Furthermore, EMMPRIN appears to be involved in early embryogenesis and reproduction, as EMMPRIN knockout mice were rarely born, and those that did survive were small, weak, and sterile, in which half died within 1 month as a result of interstitial pneumonia [36].",

Expression profiling of EMMPRIN at the transcript level showed that in humans, EMMPRIN is highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle compared with other tested organs, likely demonstrating its importance in metabolism [7]. The kidney also has high expression levels, as does the testis correlating to its involvement in spermatogenesis [7]. Of the hematopoietic cells, EMMPRIN is expressed on all leukocytes (monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes) [37], erythrocytes [38], and platelets [39]. EMMPRIN is up\u2010regulated on activated T cells and also shown recently to serve as a marker for aTregs (CD25+EMMPRIN+) versus rTreg or naive Treg (CD25+EMMPRIN\u2212) in the human system [40, 41]. Furthermore, the labeling with FoxP3, a well\u2010known intracellular Treg marker, and EMMPRIN enables the identification of 3 distinct populations: 1) EMMPRINlowFoxP3+ cells representing rTregs; 2) EMMPRINmediumFoxP3+ cells, representing Tregs that can produce cytokines (reviewed in ref. [41]), including IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u201017; and 3) EMMPRINhighFoxP3+ cells, representing aTregs that do not secrete high levels of cytokines, demonstrate highly suppressive activity, and exhibit demethylation in the Treg\u2010specific demethylated region of the FOXP3 gene, a region whose demethylation status correlates to stabilized FoxP3 expression and suppressive activity [40]. It is unknown if EMMPRIN plays a role in immune homeostasis, but it may serve as a useful marker for Treg subsets when evaluating disease progression.",

Upon entry into the thymus, the T cell precursors are classified as DN thymocytes, in which CD4+ and CD8+ surface markers are not expressed. The first stage of development can be separated into 4 DN phases, distinguished by CD25 and CD44 expression (Fig. 2A). Here, the TCR\u2010\u03b2 chain is tested for functionality, and a dramatic expansion of functional pre\u2010TCRs ensues, marking the end of the DN phase. The second stage of T cell development includes the DP thymocytes, which are positive for CD4 and CD8 surface markers, have undergone gene rearrangements for the TCR\u2010\u03b1 chain and express complete TCR:CD3 complexes. Selection processes then occur leading to the 3rd stage: positive selection of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells to yield SP thymocytes and negative selection, which causes the elimination of potential autoreactive T cells by apoptosis [43] (Fig. 2A).",

            "text": "EMMPRIN is highly expressed on the surface of all thymocytes (Fig. 2A) and shown to influence their maturation [44, 45]. Whereas all thymocytes express EMMPRIN, the mean fluorescence intensity was higher on cells that cycled more, particularly during the DN3\u2013DN4 transition, where TCR\u2010\u03b2\u2010selected cells undergo a proliferative burst [45]. The presence of an anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (clone RL73.2) halted murine thymocyte development by largely reducing levels of the DN4 (CD44\u2212CD25\u2212) stage, as well as the DP (CD4+CD8+) and CD4+ SP populations [45]. These results were corroborated by the newly generated EMMPRIN\u2010floxed mice, where EMMPRIN was conditionally ablated in T cells by use of the Lck\u2010cre promoter [46]. The conditional deletion of EMMPRIN in Lck\u2010cre\u2010expressing T cells, similar to the addition of anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibodies, resulted in a decrease in DP (CD4+CD8+; not a result of enhanced apoptosis) and CD4+ SP cells. A significant drop in thymus weight and cell number was also apparent. Although the DN phase as a whole showed no alterations in EMMPRIN\u2212/\u2212 thymocytes, the 4 DN stages were not assessed separately to analyze if there were any differences at the DN4 stage [46]. As the cycling ability of thymocytes was suggested to correlate with EMMPRIN\u2010expression levels, it is reasonable to assume that EMMPRIN plays a role in the dramatic expansion of the DN4 phase. The rapid proliferation of thymocytes likely undergoes glycolysis to meet energy demands, thus leading to the buildup of toxic intracellular lactate levels [47]. In this way, it is possible that EMMPRIN is needed as a chaperone to shuttle MCTs up to the surface to export the toxic lactate build\u2010up out of the cells. The absence of EMMPRIN would hinder this export, possibly leading to cell death or alternate metabolic pathways.",

As EMMPRIN levels are high in thymocytes (Fig. 2A), its levels in the periphery of resting T cells are low (Fig. 2B) [44] and become up\u2010regulated upon T cell activation (Fig. 2C) [44, 48, 49]. It was demonstrated that EMMPRIN negatively regulates/inhibits T cell proliferation in a MLR, where splenocytes from EMMPRIN\u2212/\u2212 animals exhibited an enhanced, proliferative response compared with wild\u2010type splenocytes when cocultured with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes [30]. A similar response was observed in anti\u2010CD3/CD28\u2010stimulated, EMMPRIN\u2212/\u2212 T cells from Lck\u2010Cre;EMMPRIN flox/flox mice, which also revealed elevated CD69 levels, an early T cell activation marker [46]. At the resting state, spleen weight and proportions of CD8 and CD4 expression levels were no different between EMMPRIN\u2212/\u2212 T cells and their controls [46]. In the human system, knockdown of EMMPRIN by use of siRNA in primary cells also increased T cell proliferation (without any changes in CD25 expression) upon activation with PHA, a surface receptor cross\u2010linker [50]. These results demonstrate EMMPRIN having a negative/inhibitory effect on T cell activation.",

            "text": "In contrast, numerous studies that use antibodies against EMMPRIN (e.g., clone MEM\u2010M6/6, 5A12, or clone 10) have shown that these antibodies suppress T cell proliferation in human PBMCs [48, 51, 52, 53\u201354]. It is suggested that anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibodies may be acting as agonists, mimicking ligand engagement [51, 52]. Interestingly, EMMPRIN\u2212/\u2212 T cells or anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibodies only altered the proliferation of T cells when stimulated with anti\u2010CD3/CD28 and not with PMA/ionomycin (a stimulant that bypasses the need for surface receptors). This implies that EMMPRIN is involved at the very early stages of T cell activation involving TCRs or costimulators [46, 51]. Minutes after TCR\u2010dependent activation, EMMPRIN aggregates to immune synapses (Fig. 2B), an area formed upon T cell activation that is densely packed with receptors and signaling molecules pivotal in initiating T cell activation. EMMPRIN colocalized with immune synapse markers, including CD4, CD8, CD48, and GM1 [51, 52], whereas the presence of anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibodies (both clone MEM\u2010M6/6 and 5A12) altered the formation of these immune synapses [51, 52]. Administration of the MEM\u2010M6/6 clone upon TCR\u2010mediated activation displaced the T cell coreceptors CD48 and CD59 from lipid rafts, leading to reduced expression of the T cell activation marker CD25 and hence, reduced T cell proliferation. Transcripts for IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201015, IL\u20104, and IL\u201010, among other cytokines (12 hours after activation), were also diminished. However, not all microdomains were affected by this antibody, as the distribution pattern of Lck did not change nor did tyrosine phosphorylation levels (5 minutes after activation), as well as IL\u20102 levels (24 hours after activation) [51]. Another EMMPRIN antibody, 5A12 clone (which docks to the EC1 domain of EMMPRIN), had similar and contrasting effects from that of the MEM\u2010M6/6 clone (which recognizes the EC2 domain) upon TCR\u2010mediated activation of human T cells. The 5A12 clone demonstrated reduced CD25 and IL\u20104 protein levels; however, the 5A12 clone also decreased tyrosine phosphorylation (2 hours after activation), EC calcium influx, and IL\u20102 protein levels, in addition to increased IFN\u2010\u03b3 protein levels (72 hours after activation) [52]. The differences in antibody responses could be a result of differences in experimental methods (e.g., the time analyzed after T cell activation) or perhaps a result of the different functional domains/epitopes of EMMPRIN that the antibodies recognize and to which they bind (\nTable 1\n). If these antibodies act as agonists, this suggests that the inhibitory effect of EMMPRIN upon TCR\u2010dependent activation works to trigger the dissociation of certain molecules from microdomains to help shut down T cell responses. The mechanism behind the involvement of EMMPRIN in T cell activation still needs to be defined clearly.",

T cell activation and proliferation require an initiation event (Signal 1, provided by TCR engagement) and a costimulatory event (Signal 2; Fig. 2B). Studies suggest that EMMPRIN expression on APCs, rather than on T cells, may be what is important in allowing for T cells to proliferate [58, 67, 68]. This was demonstrated when \u201cSignal 1\u201d provided by anti\u2010CD3 stimulation did not proliferate T cells when mixed with irradiated Signal 2\u2010supplying U937 cells, prepulsed with an anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (clone HI197). U937 cells are a human monoblastoid cell line that lacks B7 (Fig. 2B); thus, they depend on alternate costimulatory pathways to provide Signal 2 [58]. This result was confirmed by identifying EMMPRIN as one of the candidate genes involved in Chinese hamster ovary [67] or dendritic cell [68]\u2010mediated costimulation of T cells. This implicates that EMMPRIN on APCs, and not T cells, may be acting as an important costimulatory molecule for T cell activation. Yet, studies have also demonstrated proliferative inhibition by anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibodies (by use of clone 5A12 and MEM\u2010M6/6) on purified T cells, as well as PBMCs [51, 52].

The importance of CyPA\u2010EMMPRIN interactions in recruiting leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and T cells) and mediating inflammatory diseases has been demonstrated by blocking studies that use an anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (RL73.2 clone) and/or the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporine A analog in mouse models of acute lung inflammation [62], asthmatic inflammation [63], and RA (via CIA) [61].

In addition to CyPA, EMMPRIN is a receptor for CyPB [73], which induces chemotaxis of T cells in vitro comparable to RANTES [63].

In patients with T cell lymphomas, EMMPRIN was found highly expressed on peripheral blood T cells compared with healthy controls, and biopsies of skin invasions demonstrated that infiltrating T cell lymphomas were in regions of MMP\u20102+ fibroblasts [75]. Moreover, an activity\u2010blocking peptide against EMMPRIN (corresponding to the EC1 domain) inhibited the production of MMP\u20102 in an experiment by use of transformed lymphocytes (MT2) cocultured with EMMPRIN\u2010negative fibroblasts [75].

In erythrocytes, EMMPRIN appears to function as an adhesion molecule, as administration of F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (clone RL73.2) inhibited the migration of murine erythrocytes out of the spleen and into the circulation causing anemia [38]. In platelets, EMMPRIN interactions were shown to be involved in their rolling [39]. Likewise, in Jurkat cells, a T\u2010lymphoma cell line, siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of EMMPRIN reduced their adhesion to fibronectin [77]. It is noteworthy that EMMPRIN oligomerization is important in increasing the avidity of EMMPRIN interactions with other molecules and with itself for its various functional purposes (\nFig. 3A\n) [3, 5, 66, 75]. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated the interaction of EMMPRIN (likely in a lateral fashion) with \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b21 integrins but not \u03b12\u03b21 or \u03b15\u03b21 integrins in the membrane at sites of cell\u2013cell contact in cell lines [78] (Fig. 3B). CyPB, an EMMPRIN ligand, along with glycosaminoglycans, was shown to play a role in the adhesion of human PBMCs (mainly of the CD4+ CD45RO+ phenotype) to the ECM [79]. Furthermore, syndecan\u20101, a HSPG present on the cell surface of T cells, also associates with EMMPRIN (likely in the TM region) and is involved in adhesion to fibronectin via CyPB\u2010induced MAPK activation [24] (Fig. 3C). Another report identified EMMPRIN in a complex with CD98, \u03b21 integrins, and CyPB in a human promonocytic leukemia THP\u20101 cell line that mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin [81] (Fig. 3D). The binding of CyPB is thought to catalyze peptidyl\u2010prolyl cis\u2010trans isomerase activity in EMMPRIN, triggering intracellular signaling events that induce cell aggregation or integrin\u2010mediated adhesion through a PI3K\u2010protein kinase C\u03b4\u2010MAPK pathway. It is proposed that CD98 can regulate \u03b21 integrin affinity and was reported to coimmunoprecipitate with \u03b14\u03b21 integrins in PBMCs [81]. Hyaluronan\u2010CD44\u2010MCT\u2010EMMPRIN complexes were also shown to exist in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines [83] (Fig. 3G). Besides its metabolic roles, in T cells, the best established function of CD44 is its adhesive capabilities [86]. In addition, the presence of a mAb toward EMMPRIN (clone 10) on activated human PBMCs was reported to reduce \u03b14 integrin and NF\u2010\u03baB signaling, leaving Akt and MAPK signaling unaffected, and clone 10 decreased T cell adhesion to endothelial cells [66].",

In the human Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line, EMMPRIN mAbs (MEM\u2010M6/8 and/or HAb18) also induced homotypic aggregation [23, 59] and adhesion to the LFA\u20101 ligand, ICAM\u20101; this adhesion was also regulated by the presence of CD43 [23]. All 3 adhesion molecules, CD18 (representing LFA\u20101), CD43, and EMMPRIN, colocalized together at sites of cell\u2013cell contact; however, 2 distinct CD43 complexes with EMMPRIN or LFA\u20101 existed based on coimmunoprecipitation experiments [23] (Fig. 3F). CD43 is a sialoglycoprotein that is highly glycosylated containing a net negative charge; thus, it likely is able to repulse cell contacts, which is important for cell migration, but can still permit cell contacts in the first place. It is probable that CD43 interactions with EMMPRIN or LFA\u20101 may inhibit their adhesive capabilities. Moreover, it was shown recently that in the presence of an anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (HAb18), alone, in Jurkat cells or CD4+ primary cells, cell aggregation increased with time, whereas CyPA\u2010induced chemotaxis decreased; these results imply a functional trade\u2010off for EMMPRIN [59]. Interestingly, knocking down EMMPRIN in Jurkat cells by RNA interference also induced cell aggregation and decreased levels of CD98 [59]. This is surprising, as EMMPRIN and CD98 are thought to mediate adhesion. Clearly, EMMPRIN and CD98 expression levels are linked. It is speculated that EMMPRIN may inhibit cell aggregation and that the addition of an anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody may work to inhibit EMMPRIN in carrying out this particular negative role (thus acting as an antagonist instead of an agonist) [59]. Even though EMMPRIN is shown to be involved in adhesion (as demonstrated in the paragraphs above), different adhesion complexes likely exist, and treatment with EMMPRIN mAbs may cause rearrangement of these adhesion complexes.",

Although glycolysis generates energy faster than oxidative phosphorylation, it is a less efficient approach and leads to the accumulation of lactic acid byproducts. In cancer, this altered energy metabolism is known as the Warburg effect, an effect that EMMPRIN appears to regulate. As mentioned previously, EMMPRIN is an important player in alleviating the toxic build\u2010up of lactic acid in cancers by shuttling lactate transporters\u2014MCTs\u2014up to the plasma membrane [14, 25, 88]. The silencing of EMMPRIN in pancreatic or breast cancer cells inhibited MCT1 and MCT4 expression, reduced their growth, and decreased their glycolytic rate and lactate efflux [83, 89]. An MCT\u2010EMMPRIN\u2010CD98\u2010LAT1 supercomplex with a neutral amino acid transporter (ASCT2) was shown to exist in human fibrosarcoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, demonstrating importance in cellular metabolism [82] (Fig. 3E). Moreover, hyaluronan\u2010CD44\u2010MCT\u2010EMMPRIN complexes exist in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines [83] (Fig. 3G). That being said, lactate transport is also important in lymphocyte activation [47], where inhibition of MCT1 (an interacting partner of EMMPRIN) during T cell activation inhibited T cell proliferation and lactate efflux [90]. Thus, EMMPRIN may play a role in alleviating toxic lactic acid byproducts during the rapid proliferation of T cells (Fig. 2C), an area requiring investigation.",

With all of these positive roles for EMMRIN in tumor growth and biology, more and more groups are exploring and understanding the benefit of the use of anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibodies as a potential tumor therapy, including HCC (HAb18 and Licartin) [102] and head and neck cancer (CNTO 3899 clone) [103].",

            "text": "In relation to T cell biology, glycosylated EMMPRIN is highly expressed in Jurkat cells compared with normal human PBMCs [77, 104]. The silencing of EMMPRIN in Jurkat cells decreased its proliferation, migration, and adhesion to fibronectin; this emphasizes the importance of EMMPRIN in the survival and growth of cancer cells. As noted before, the absence of EMMPRIN in primary T cells led to their hyperproliferation [30, 46, 50]. The contradictory results can be explained by the proliferation of cancer cells acting through a mechanism not dependent on TCR\u2010mediated signaling events, as is the case in primary T cells. When Jurkat cells were cocultured with superantigen\u2010loaded Raji B cells, thus subjected to conjugate formation, EMMPRIN aggregated at T cell immune synapses. When Jurkat cells were also stimulated with anti\u2010CD3 antibodies to initiate TCR\u2010dependent signaling events, contrary to TCR\u2010independent mechanisms [77], EMMPRIN overexpression inhibited T cell activity, as demonstrated by NFAT inhibition (an essential transcription factor in T cell activation), whereas EMMPRIN knockdown promoted NFAT signaling activity (events umpired by the intracellular domain of EMMPRIN) [104]. The inhibitory effect of EMMPRIN on TCR\u2010mediated activation in Jurkat cells occurred downstream of the Vav1 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras\u2010related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) signaling pathway and upstream of the JNK and serine/threonine\u2010protein kinase 1 pathway; ERK signaling remained unaffected. Besides signaling, functional activities, such as proliferation, however, was not assessed [104]. This supports that TCR\u2010mediated activation brings out a regulatory/inhibitory effect of EMMPRIN at the early stages of T cell activity. However, in TCR\u2010independent activation/proliferation, as found in cancer cells (such as lymphomas) or in activated autoimmune T cells (such as in SLE), EMMPRIN (highly up\u2010regulated compared with resting primary T cells) may act in a positive or stimulatory manner for activities, such as adhesion, invasion, migration, or aiding, in the Warburg effect.",

The application of the anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (clone MEM\u2010M6/1) reduced tyrosine phosphorylation levels in anti\u2010CD3/anti\u2010CD28\u2010stimulated T cells from SLE patients, although this did not affect MMP activity [57].

A phase 1/2 clinical trial that uses ABX\u2010CBL (also known as gavilimomab), an IgM mAb that recognizes EMMPRIN, for the treatment of steroid\u2010resistant acute GVHD had shown encouraging results [109].

Plaques consist of an accumulation of inflammatory cells and subsequent production of MMPs, which may lead to plaque breakdown and surrounding cell death, thereby worsening the disease progress [119, 120, 121\u2013122]. EMMPRIN expression in patients with acute myocardial infarction was found up\u2010regulated on circulating monocytes and correlated with monocytic MT1\u2010MMP levels and MMP\u20109 plasma activity [123]. As platelets and monocytes play a pathogenic role in atherosclerosis, it was demonstrated that EMMPRIN\u2013EMMPRIN interactions in a coculture of platelets with monocytes induced the secretion of MMPs, proinflammatory (IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1), and anti\u2010inflammatory (IL\u201010) cytokines in monocytes via an NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010mediated pathway [39]. In addition, a mouse model of myocardial infarction demonstrated that EMMPRIN+/\u2212 mice, mice treated with an anti\u2010EMMPRIN antibody (RL73.2 clone), or CyPA\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a reduced infarct size compared with controls; this is likely a consequence of impaired CyPA\u2010mediated recruitment and adhesion of monocytes and neutrophils to the injured site [65]. This suggests that EMMPRIN plays a role in leukocyte recruitment and MMP induction in cardiovascular disease, and thus, the targeting of cyclophilin\u2010EMMPRIN interactions may be of a therapeutic benefit.

EMMPRIN is a single TM protein consisting of 3 N\u2010linked glycosylated sites at asparagine residues (Asn) in the EC region, a TM containing a highly conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu), and a short cytoplasmic tail. The EC region can be broken into 2 Ig\u2010like loops (EC1 and EC2), held together by disulfide bonds. Each domain of EMMPRIN interacts with different proteins, thus, having different functional capabilities. See text for details. C, C\u2010terminal; N, N\u2010terminal; S\u2010S, disulfide bond.",

It is highly expressed in thymocytes during T cell development, playing a role in the transition phase from DN3 to DN4, where a proliferative burst occurs (A). In the periphery, EMMPRIN expression levels are low and localize to the immune synapse upon TCR\u2010mediated T cell activation. TCR\u2010MHC engagement leads to the up\u2010regulation of CD40 ligand (CD40L; Signal 1), allowing for B7\u2010CD28 costimulation (Signal 2). APCs also express EMMPRIN, where it may act as an alternate costimulator to provide \u201cSignal 2\u201d for T cell activation. EMMPRIN interacts with a number of molecules regulating adhesion (see Fig. 3), which could play a role in immune synapse formation (B). Once T cells are activated, EMMPRIN levels are up\u2010regulated and involved in a number of actions (C; see text for further details). MHC, major histocompatibility complex.",

            "text": "Figure 3: EMMPRIN interactions. EMMPRIN can interact with a wide range of binding partners, such as itself forming oligomers (increasing its avidity for other interacting partners) and/or through homotypic interactions between cells, allowing for MMP induction (A). EMMPRIN interacts with \u03b21 integrins (B). EC cyclophilin (CyPA/B) may bind and isomerize EMMPRIN in an HSPG\u2010dependent fashion, likely triggering intracellular signaling events, allowing for migration and/or integrin\u2010mediated adhesion. Upon T cell activation, increased EMMPRIN oligomerization allows CyPA to bind without the need for HSPGs. CyPB associates by interacting with the heparin sulfates on syndecan\u20101 and the EC regions of EMMPRIN (C). EMMPRIN also interacts with CD98 (likely via the EC region of EMMPRIN) and \u03b21 integrins (D). Interestingly, a MCT\u2010EMMPRIN\u2010CD98\u2010LAT1\u2010ASCT2 supercomplex exists, demonstrating that CD98 is involved in regulating EMMPRIN\u2010mediated adhesion and energy metabolism (E). Competitive binding of EMMPRIN for CD43 with LFA\u20101 affects the adhesive capability of T cells (F). Lastly, a hyaluronan\u2010CD44\u2010MCT\u2010EMMPRIN supercomplex is shown, important in energy metabolism and drug resistance; in T cells, hyaluronan\u2010CD44 is important in adhesion and migration (G).",
