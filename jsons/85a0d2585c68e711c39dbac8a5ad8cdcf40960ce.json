This is exploited in sentiment analysis where machine learning models are used to predict the review score from the text of the review. Furthermore, the products costumers have purchased in the past are indicative of the products they will purchase in the future. This is what recommender systems exploit by learning models from purchase information to predict the items a customer might be interested in. The underlying structure of this problem setting is a bipartite graph, wherein customer nodes are connected to product nodes via 'review' links. This is reminiscent of knowledge bases, with 'review' links replacing relation types. We propose TransRev, an approach to the product recommendation problem that integrates ideas from recommender systems, sentiment analysis, and multi-relational learning into a joint learning objective.",

In the same year, e-commerce sales accounted for 41.6% of all retail sales growth [15] . For some entertainment products such as movies, books, and music, online retailers have long outperformed traditional in-store retailers. One of the driving forces of this success is the ability of online retailers to collect purchase histories of customers, online shopping behavior, and reviews of products for a very large number of users. This data is driving several machine learning applications in online retail, of which personalized recommendation is the most important one. With recommender systems online retailers can provide personalized product recommendations and anticipate purchasing behavior. In addition, the availability of product reviews allows users to make more informed purchasing choices and companies to analyze costumer sentiment towards their products. The latter was coined sentiment analysis and is concerned with machine learning approaches that map written text to scores. Nevertheless, even the best sentiment analysis methods cannot help in determining which new products a costumer might be interested in. The obvious reason is that costumer reviews are not available for products they have not purchased yet.",

At prediction time, these models predict product ratings based on some operation (typically the dot product) applied to the user and product representations.

Our second learning procedure aims at overcoming this limitation by leveraging ideas from embeddingbased knowledge base completion methods.

Hence, in addition to the learning objective (2), we introduce a second objective that forces the embedding of a review to be close to the difference between the item and user embeddings. This translation-based modeling assumption is followed in TransE [5] and several other knowledge base completion methods [10, 13] .

Given the user and item embeddings, and without further constraints, it allows to distinctively compute the approximate review embedding via Eq. (6). Another popular knowledge graph embedding method is DistMult [16] . In applying such modeling assumption to this problem one would obtain the approximate review embedding by solving the following optimization problem:\u0125 rev (u,i) = max h (e i \u2022 e u )h, where \u2022 is the element-wise multiplication. The solution to that problem would be any vector with infinite norm. Therefore, one should impose constraints in the norm of the embeddings to obtain a non-trivial solution. However, previous work [11] shows that such constraint harms performance. Similarly, most of the knowledge graph embedding methods would require to impose constraints in the norm of the embeddings. The translation modeling assumption of TransE facilitates the approximation of the review embedding without additional constraints, while its performance is on par with, if not better, than most of all other translation-based knowledge graph embedding methods [11] .",

In the last years, many embedding-based methods have been proposed to infer missing relations in knowledge graphs based on a function that computes a likelihood score based on the embeddings of entities and relation types. Due to its simplicity and good performance, there is a large body of work on translation-based scoring functions [5, 13] . [14] propose an approach to large-scale sequential sales prediction that embeds items into a transition space where user embeddings are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. The associated optimization problem is formulated as a sequential Bayesian ranking problem [28] . To the best of our knowledge, [14] is the first work in leveraging ideas from knowledge graph completion methods for recommender system. Whereas TransRev addresses the problem of rating prediction by incorporating review text, [14] addresses the different problem of sequential recommendation. Therefore the experimental comparison to that work is not possible. In TransRev the review embedding translates the user embedding to the product embedding. In [14] , the user embedding translates a product embedding to the embedding of the next purchased product. Moreover, TransRev gets rid of the margin-based loss (and consequently of the negative sampling) due to the joint optimization of Eqs. (2) and (4), whereas [14] is formalized as a ranking problem in a similar way to [5] . Subsequently, there has been additional work on translation-based models in recommender systems [25, 33] . However, these works cannot incorporate users' feedback other than ratings into the learning, which has been shown to boost performance [21] .",

However, such a corpus may not be available for some low-resource languages or domainspecific use cases. For TransRev's parameters were randomly initialized [12] and learned with vanilla stochastic gradient descent. A single learning iteration performs SGD with all review triples in the training data and their associated ratings. For TransRev we used a batch size of 64. We ran TransRev for a maximum of 500 epochs and validated every 10 epochs. For SVD we used the Python package Surprise 4 , and chose the learning rate and regularization term from the same range of values. Parameters for HFT were learned with L-BFGS, which was run for 2,500 learning iterations and validated every 50 iterations. For DeepCoNN the original authors' code is not available and we used a third-party implementation 5 .

To quantify that the rating predictions made by HFT and TransRev are significantly different we have computed the dependent t-test for paired samples and for all data sets where TransRev outperforms HFT. The p-value is always smaller than 0.01. It is remarkable the low performance of DeepCoNN, MPCN and T-Nets in almost all datasets. This is in line with the findings reported in very recent work [8] , where authors' analysis reveals that deep recommender models are systematically outperformed by simple heuristic recommender methods. These results only confirm the existing problem reported in [8] . We randomly selected the 4 data sets Baby, Digital Music, Office and Tools&Home Improvement from the Amazon data and evaluated different values of k for user, item and word embedding sizes. We increase k from 4 to 64 and always validate all hyperparameters, including the regularization term. Table 2 list the MSE scores. We only observe small differences in the corresponding model's performances. This observation is in line with [21] . For most of the data sets the validated weighting term \u03bb takes the value of either 0.1 or 0.25. This seems to indicate that the regression objective is more important than the modeling assumption in our task, as it directly relates to the goal of the task. The regularization term is of crucial importance to obtain good performance and largely varies across data sets, as their statistics also largely differ across data sets. Review embeddings, which are learned from word embeddings, are learned to be good predictors of user ratings. As a consequence the learned word embeddings are correlated with the ratings. To visualize the correlation between words and ratings we proceed as follows. First, we assign a score to each word that is computed by taking the average rating of the reviews that contain the word. Second, we compute a 2-dimensional representation of the words by applying t-SNE [20] to the 16-dimensional word embeddings learned by TransRev. Figure 4 depicts these 2-dimensional word embedding vectors learned for the Amazon Beauty data set. The corresponding rating scores are indicated by the color.",

This approximation is used to make a rating prediction, but it can also be used to propose a tentative review on which the user can elaborate on. This is related to a number of approaches [18, 27, 37] on explainable recommendations. We compute the Euclidean distance between the approximated review embedding\u0125 rev (u,i) and all review embeddings h rev (u,i) from the training set. We then retrieve the review text with the most similar review embedding. We investigate the quality of the tentative reviews that TransRev retrieves for the Beauty and Digital Music data sets. The example reviews listed in Table 3 show that while the overall sentiment is correct in most cases, we can also observe the following shortcomings: (a) The function f chosen in our work is invariant to word ordering and, therefore, cannot learn that bigrams such as \"not good\" have a negative meaning. (b) Despite matching the overall sentiment, the actual and retrieved review can refer to different aspects of the product (for example, \"it clumps\" and \"gives me headaches\"). Related work [37] extracts aspects from reviews by applying a number of grammatical and morphological analysis tools. These aspects are used later on to explain why the model suspects that a user might be interested in a certain product. We think this type of explanation is complementary to ours, and might inspire future work. (c) Reviews can be specific to a single product. A straightforward improvement could consist of retrieving only existing reviews for the specific product under consideration. Table 3 .
