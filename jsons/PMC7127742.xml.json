An imbalance in MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs) has been suggested as a cause of lesion initiation and progression during canine distemper virus infection (Miao et al., 2003, Gr\u00f6ters et al., 2005). Green et al. (2011), working with human CSF, demonstrated that the expression of MMPs/TIMPs in the CSF during CNS infections is determined by the etiologic agent, and that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are especially involved in inflammatory cell migration into the neuropil due to their ability to digest type-IV collagen, which is the major component of the basal membrane that involves the capillaries (Rosemberg, 2002). Further, MMPs and TIMPs, together with other classical biomarkers, have been used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementia (Bjerke et al., 2011), but biomarkers do not usually have relevance in clinical animal diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, with this study, we aimed to detect MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the CSF and in cerebellar tissue by gelatin-zymography, as well as to identify these MMPs and inflammatory cells in the cerebellum using immunohistochemistry.",

The total protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (23225, Pierce Biotechnology). The gelatinolytic activity of these samples was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gelatin zymography, according to the method previously described by Machado et al.

MMP identity and normalization between gels was achieved with a sample of canine mammary adenocarcinoma previously standardized with human recombinant MMP-2 (PF037, Calbiochem) and MMP-9 (PF038, Calbiochem).

MMP-9, MMP-14 and TIMP-1 are expressed mostly in astrocytes and in macrophages/microglia in initial lesions, while infiltrating lymphocytes as well as activated macrophages/microglia are the main source of these components in advanced distemper leukoencephalitis (Gr\u00f6ters et al., 2005). The production of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 by T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells is required for their migration across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and their subsequent invasion of the CNS compartment (Rosemberg, 2002, Stamatovic et al., 2008). By immunohistochemistry, we detected MMP-2 and MMP-9 preferentially in mononuclear cells. Nevertheless, the role of MMPs within the CNS may start prior to leukocyte infiltration. In canine inflammatory brain lesions, microglial cells expressed a variety of MMPs and TIMPs mRNAs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9; and some dogs also presented MMP-2 activity in brain-zymography (Stein et al., 2011). Further, in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TME), a virus-induced model of multiple sclerosis, after stereotaxic injection of activated MMP-3, -9, and -12 into the caudal cerebellar peduncle of adult mice, the authors noticed a focally extensive primary demyelination, before the infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as a reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes (Hansmann et al., 2012). In demyelination, MMPs also act in myelin basic protein fragmentation (Shiryaev et al., 2009).",

By zymography, there was no way of detecting a constant profile of MMPs in the CSF and the cerebellar tissue of the dogs and establishing a secure biomarker for the subacute inflammatory phase of the CDV infection; however, pro-MMP-2 was present in most of the CSF samples and pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were increased in the cerebellum. The MMPs/TIMPs imbalance may contribute to the complex mechanisms enrolled in distemper leukoencephalitis and therapies based on metalloproteinase inhibitors for dogs may be an additional aid to help in the recovery or stop the progression of the lesions in animals in the acute phase of disease.",
