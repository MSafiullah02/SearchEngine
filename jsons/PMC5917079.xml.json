A large part of the program is the field component, which exposes the residents to real-time experiences where they learn to detect and respond to diverse public health events. On graduation from the program, the residents are skilled in applied epidemiology and are highly qualified for government-level public health positions; globally, more than 80% of FETP graduates work in government and many obtain leadership positions within national health systems [1].",

The focus at that time was to improve the use of data at all levels of the Jordan Ministry of Health. From 2001 to 2004, the FETP was in its second phase as the Jordan Surveillance Project (phase II) and expanded its scope to include communicable and noncommunicable disease surveillance. Two major systems, the Mortality Surveillance System and the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, were put in place. In 2004 (phase III), the program was renamed the Jordan Applied Epidemiology Project, with an enhanced focus on surveillance systems. The current phase (phase IV) of the FETP is marked by the departure of the CDC-assigned Resident Advisor, demonstrating a sustainable and institutionalized J-FETP. As of 2007, the program became fully sustained and is being run by the Jordan Ministry of Health.",

By 2017, the program had graduated a total of 63 physicians (Figure 1), with 17 residents in training. All residents who have enrolled in the program so far have been physicians, with the exception of 2 veterinarians, who enrolled during the height of the influenza epidemic in 2007. Of the graduates, 62% (39/63) work as epidemiologists at the central or governorate level of the Jordan Ministry of Health. Jordan is one of the few countries in the region that meets the international public health standard of 1 field epidemiologist per 200,000 people, with at least one FETP graduate working in 8 of the 12 governorates. All of the remaining graduates work in the region: 16% (10/63) at the government level, 13% (8/63) as regional epidemiologic experts, and 10% (6/63) with international nongovernmental organizations. The J-FETP is currently training its 13th cohort, with 14 physicians enrolled. The Ministry of Health recently incorporated the FETP into the Community Medicine Residency Program as part of the Jordan Medical Council. As a result, the J-FETP program is now accredited as a training program for the Jordanian Board Certificate in community medicine. ",

The Ministry of Health facilities experience the burden of addressing the unique health profile of Syrian refugees and require support in optimizing their capacity. The J-FETP established a system for collecting and reporting data regarding Syrian refugee care at Ministry of Health facilities. An FETP focal point in local governorates reports data regarding refugee health care at Ministry of Health facilities to the Primary Health Care Administration. The data inform the Jordan Ministry of Health of health trends among the Syrian population such as potential disease outbreaks, access to Ministry of Health facilities by the refugee population, and the type of care provided. With this information, the Jordan Ministry of Health is able to respond to the needs of the Syrian refugee population, prevent major population health issues, and identify needs for increased health facility capacity. The Ministry of Health is also able to communicate monthly data reports to international nongovernmental organizations to enable a collaborative humanitarian response.",

J-FETP has recognized the burden of noncommunicable diseases, assessed the trend of major diseases, and addressed the concern at the national and local government levels [8]. J-FETP has led the implementation of 3 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System surveys to identify the population behaviors causing noncommunicable diseases and to assess the changes in the pattern of noncommunicable diseases. The survey was designed and conducted by J-FETP residents in 2002, 2004, and 2007. Major findings of the 2002 and 2004 surveys were published in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [9,10], and the 2007 survey findings were published in the CDC\u2019s Preventing Chronic Disease journal [11]. The survey results were accessed by public health officers to provide government and policy decision makers with evidence-based information used in the context of determining national health priorities, as well as planning, evaluating, and monitoring country health programs. In response to the survey findings, the Non-Communicable Disease Directorate was established in the Ministry of Health in 2005. The Directorate is responsible for monitoring noncommunicable disease surveillance and implementing noncommunicable disease reduction programs. The Directorate is led by a J-FETP graduate, and J-FETP residents spend a portion of their training working within the Directorate.",

After the program, each graduate went on to lead surveillance units in Gaza and the West Bank. J-FETP supported Iraq in increasing its public health capacity through enrolling 3 Iraqi physicians into the program. The 3 residents completed the program alongside their Jordanian counterparts, during which time they conducted and published investigations in Iraq on thallium poisoning (in 2008) [14] and a cholera outbreak in 2008 (F Al-lami, written communication, December 2017). J-FETP continued to offer assistance and guidance to Iraq as it established its own FETP in 2010, led by one of the Iraqi graduates of the J-FETP. Moreover, the J-FETP hosted 3 Yemeni residents. During their stay in Jordan at the Ministry of Health, Yemeni residents in turn participated in outbreak investigations in Jordan, diversifying their skills and obtaining exposure to a range of public health concerns. The Yemeni residents completed their second year in their home country, bringing their new skills and experience back to their national Ministry of Health. The residents went on to lead a major investigation of a dengue fever outbreak and presented a comprehensive report of dengue fever along the Red and Arabian seas at the EMPHNET regional conference in 2011 [15]. In addition, J-FETP also enrolled 2 Syrians as residents in the program in 2011 with a long-term plan of starting an FETP in Syria. Though the current Syrian crisis has halted efforts to establish an FETP, Jordan remains supportive of public health professionals in neighboring countries.",

The health system is widely accessed by the population, and the Ministry of Health provides 61% of all health care [16].
