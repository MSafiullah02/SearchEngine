This strategy helps address the challenge of identifying at-risk patients with sufficient lead time to either prevent the event from occurring or limit its severity. To allow for the discussion of the VRI as an early warning tool, the primary model results chosen for discussion hereafter are those representing the removal of case data within 2 hours of the deterioration event. VRI performance results were generated by performing 10-fold cross-validation (dividing the data into 10 folds, then using 9 folds to produce predicted values for the remaining fold). The 10-fold cross-validation process was repeated 10 times to reduce the variability in the reported performance results. For graphical and statistical comparisons, PEWS performance is compared with an averaged VRI ROC curve, constructed by taking the mean predicted response at the patient level across the 10 repetitions of cross-validation. We did not use a train-test split in performance assessment due to the small number of available cases.",

Matching on the very high specificity of PEWS-5 (0.99), the sensitivity of the VRI (0.25, 95% CI, 0.19\u20130.32) is significantly lower than that of PEWS-5 (0.46, 95% CI, 0.38\u20130.54) at the time of the event (Fig. 2B).
