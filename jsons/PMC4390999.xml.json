            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases have an enormous impact on human health (Marston et al., 2014). Viruses account for a significant proportion of emerging infections, and the majority have zoonotic origins, including ebolaviruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hantaviruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and influenza A viruses (Jones et al., 2008, Taylor et al., 2001). Transmission can occur directly to people from live reservoir hosts (e.g., bat shedding of Nipah virus into date palm collection vessels [Luby et al., 2006]). In other instances, exposures to novel viruses have been associated with the butchering of reservoir hosts, such as bush meat in SIV or simian foamy virus transmission (Hahn et al., 2000, Wolfe et al., 2004) and, recently, in the index case of the ebolavirus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (WHO, 2014). Alternatively, transmission can be facilitated by intermediate hosts (e.g., Nipah virus infection of pigs in Malaysia resulting in pig-to-pig and pig-to-human transmission by aerosol [Parashar et al., 2000]) or can be transferred via insect vectors, as is the case for Dengue fever and West Nile virus (Mackenzie and Jeggo, 2013). Substantial growth in size and mobility of human populations, along with environmental and climate changes, and the spread of agricultural practices promoting human-animal contact has led to an increased frequency of pathogen emergence and potential for rapid dissemination (Karesh et al., 2012). Novel viruses are being described that cause disease in humans, such as the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) associated with acute respiratory illness and renal failure (Zaki et al., 2012). Other zoonotic viruses continue to spread into new populations, as is the case for a current outbreak of Ebola virus in western Africa, where this virus was not previously documented and where it is having an unprecedented societal, economic, and public health impact (Pandey et al., 2014, WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014).",

For instance, the origins of Ebola virus, although first identified in 1976, were only recently tied to bats (Biek et al., 2006, Pigott et al., 2014). These tools are enabling initiatives to monitor viruses in wildlife populations in their natural habitat before they emerge in humans and other animals (Mokili et al., 2012, Morse et al., 2012). Ecological, epidemiological, and evolutionary processes involved in the introduction and spread of pathogens in novel host populations are the subject of intensive research (Antia et al., 2003, Holmes and Drummond, 2007, Woolhouse et al., 2012). However, there is little understanding of the within-host immunological processes underlying reservoir host-virus interactions, and this issue is rarely addressed in studies of emerging viral diseases. Yet within-host processes are ultimately critical in determining the outcome of infection, the balance between limiting infection-associated pathology and clearing the virus, and therefore the likelihood of transmission.",

            "text": "Upon cross-species jumps, viruses can result in severe or fatal disease in the novel, non-natural hosts, while these same viruses often appear to cause only mild infections in their reservoir hosts. Examples exist in which circulating viruses can be lethal in reservoir host populations, as is the case for rabies virus in bat populations. But even rabies virus mortality rates were recently estimated using epidemiological models as being much lower in their natural bat reservoir (\u223c10%) than in other mammals (Blackwood et al., 2013). As we will discuss, there have been few detailed direct studies of the pathogenesis of emerging viruses in their natural wildlife hosts, and given the notorious difficulty of measuring mortality rates in wildlife populations, some reservoir host populations could be affected to a greater degree than we currently understand. Longitudinal studies may reveal fitness costs, even when the symptoms of infection are far less pronounced than what is observed in non-natural human hosts. One documented example is simian immunodeficiency virus in chimpanzees (SIVcpz), the viral precursor of HIV-1 in humans. SIVcpz leads to detectable depletion of CD4+ T cells and is associated with shorter life spans and reduced reproductive success of wild chimpanzees (Keele et al., 2009). Although SIVcpz infection is less pathogenic in chimpanzees than HIV-1 in humans, it is not apathogenic. Whether this is related to the more recent acquisition of SIV by chimpanzees as compared to the older association of SIV with other African nonhuman primates is still unclear (Bailes et al., 2003). In contrast, SIV infection of sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys, two natural reservoir hosts of SIV, despite a high prevalence in the wild and persistent high-level viral replication, has no detectable impact on host survival or health (Keele et al., 2009, Pandrea and Apetrei, 2010, Silvestri et al., 2003). In fact, in many cases, available observations suggest that zoonotic viruses are able to persist in natural reservoir populations for significant periods of time with no overt signs of pathology.",

Here, we argue that elucidating the nature of immune responses in individual natural hosts may inform our understanding of how virus-host equilibria are established without substantially impacting host health. Furthermore, this may provide insight into the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and immunity in humans. We ask whether there are fundamental immunologic properties that govern different infection outcomes of natural reservoir species compared to non-natural human hosts while acknowledging that other aspects of host physiology, behavior, or population biology may also play fundamentally important roles. Further, we examine whether there are any immunological principles underlying the association of specific reservoir host species with multiple emerging viruses. Eventually, characterizing the host-pathogen interface in key reservoir hosts may enable us to predict which novel viruses are more likely to pose threats to human health.",

Infection outcomes may vary from resolving with only mild symptoms (e.g., simian foamy virus [Wolfe et al., 2004]) to rapid developing severe disease that is either fatal or cleared (e.g., ebolaviruses), whereas others are persistent and lead to disease only after a prolonged period (e.g., HIV). The balance between protective and pathogenic immune responses is critical (Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010). A pivotal role in this balance is played by innate immune effectors that detect the presence of viral products by pattern recognition receptors, thus initiating the host response (Iwasaki, 2012). The specific cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators produced in response to immune activation, as well as downstream adaptive responses that themselves can modulate the innate response, can skew the relative balance between aggressive responses that rapidly clear infection and responses that minimize the extent of immunopathology. Exuberant innate immune activation can also play a direct role in precipitating host organ tissue damage (Cameron et al., 2008, Kuiken et al., 2012).",

In emerging viral infections causing disease in humans in whom host responses have been studied, innate immune responses are often thought to underlie severe disease manifestations. In the acute respiratory infections with SARS CoV and influenza A, excessive innate immune activation causes local tissue damage and compromises the generation of protective adaptive immune responses (Kash et al., 2006, Peiris et al., 2010). During infection with highly pathogenic influenza A viruses, production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the site of infection contributes to the severity of the pulmonary disease and systemic complications (Kuiken et al., 2012, Peiris et al., 2010). In addition, other mediators of inflammation, including sphingosine phosphates, also play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of influenza tissue damage and disease (Oldstone and Rosen, 2014). Specific virus strains such as H5N1 and the 1918 H1N1 viruses are particularly potent in activating high-level sustained proinflammatory cytokine production following infection (Kash et al., 2006, Peiris et al., 2010). Similarly, the pathogenesis of SARS involves infection of important cell populations in the lung, along with the elicitation of high levels of a range of inflammatory mediators (Totura and Baric, 2012). Importantly, in individuals who resolve SARS CoV infections, evidence of active innate responses wane, and effective adaptive responses develop that clear the infection. By contrast, individuals with poor outcomes exhibit persistently elevated type I interferon (IFN) production, IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and chemokine production in association with impaired antiviral antibody responses (Cameron et al., 2008, Totura and Baric, 2012).",

High levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue factor lead to lymphocyte apoptosis, pathologic activation of coagulation cascades, and widespread compromise of vascular integrity that results in multiorgan failure and a septic shock-like syndrome (Martinez et al., 2012, Misasi and Sullivan, 2014, Zampieri et al., 2007).

Erosion of immunocompetence was initially thought to arise from active virus replication causing progressive depletion of CD4+ T cell populations. However, more recent evidence indicates that chronic, pleiotropic immune activation (evidenced by increased activation, proliferation, apoptosis, and dysfunction across diverse immune effector cell populations) during HIV infection is the major driver of progressive immune deficiency leading to AIDS (Moir et al., 2011). A key contributor to chronic immune activation in HIV is the ability of unrelenting virus replication to stimulate host innate immune responses and the production of type I IFNs and other proinflammatory cytokines (Miedema et al., 2013). The resulting compromised infection resistance may further amplify systemic immune activation and exacerbate its damaging effects by resulting in the expansion of the enteric virome, damaging the intestinal epithelium and leading to the translocation of intestinal bacteria, viruses, and the antigens derived from them (Brenchley et al., 2006, Handley et al., 2012).",

Given the central role of type I IFN in the direct inhibition of viral replication within cells and in the activation and execution of host innate and adaptive immune responses, it is not surprising that diverse viral gene products have been shown to specifically block the induction or the effects of the host IFN response. Ebolavirus VP35 and VP24, lassa virus NP, influenza virus NS1, SARS CoV NSP1, and ORF3b are just a few examples (Ayllon and Garcia-Sastre, 2015, Hastie et al., 2012, Totura and Baric, 2012). Viral products have also been demonstrated to intercept ISGs, other immune recognition pathways, restriction factors, or production of effector molecules (Menachery et al., 2014). Features of the virion, such as the complex structure and heavy glycosylation of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, can make them less effective targets for elicitation of neutralizing antibody responses or structurally impervious to them when they arise (Burton et al., 2005). Moreover, the viral genome itself plays a role in the rapid evasion of adaptive immune responses, with the generation of diverse viral quasispecies that is an inherent consequence of error-prone RNA replication mechanisms (Holmes and Drummond, 2007). Thus, the efficacy of the host response to infection depends on the complex interplay of beneficial activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, the potency and impact of viral strategies for immune evasion, and the deleterious consequences of protracted or misdirected immune responses.",

Further, population-level persistence of emerging pathogens in their reservoirs has primarily been investigated from an ecological perspective, and the contribution of the host response to determining population-level infection dynamics within reservoirs is unclear. Experimental studies will provide critical data to improve field ecological studies by identifying which age classes, gender, or status of individual to focus on in studying transmission events. Experimental infections will also form the basis for improving dynamic modeling of infectious diseases, which is used to assess infection risk and develop better controls to prevent spillovers (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009).

In addition, immunological effector mechanisms that substantially restrict virus replication will affect viral genetic diversity and evolution in ways that may impact the spillover probability and the strain structure present in the reservoir host population (Box 1). A greater viral diversity may increase the chances that at least a few viral variants are able to successfully establish an infection in the novel host. Thus, we speculate that viruses that have either chronically high virus levels or repeated transient high pathogen burdens in their natural hosts may be overrepresented among emerging viral pathogens in humans (Figure 1\n).",

Such a tradeoff arises if resistance and tolerance are mechanistically connected. For instance, more aggressive effector responses that result in superior pathogen replication control may also be the responses that lead to increased collateral damage. Alternatively, such a tradeoff might be observed if resistance and tolerance are energetically costly, and it is only feasible to invest resources in one of the two strategies. Moreover, attenuated immune responses may result in waning immunologic memory. For instance, anti-yellow fever virus (YFV) antibody titers following YFV vaccination declined far more rapidly post infection in sooty mangabeys, a primate reservoir for YFV, than in YFV-disease susceptible rhesus macaques and humans (Mandl et al., 2011). Whether a tradeoff between resistance and tolerance is a generalized phenomenon remains to be investigated. A study of the rate of decline in CD4+ T cells across different HIV viral load set points in humans found no relationship between resistance and tolerance, although it may be the case that such a link would only become apparent over a longer period of host-pathogen coevolution (Regoes et al., 2014).",

Given the high prevalence of seropositivity and the presence of an enormous diversity of influenza A strains present in birds (Verhagen et al., 2012), this might be an example in which reservoir hosts previously infected with one strain are only partially protected from infection with co-circulating viral strains, but this requires further investigation. In pteropid fruit bat species, infections with Hendra and Nipah viruses are likely also transient, but few experimental infection studies have been done so far and the infection incidence is currently unknown (Halpin et al., 2011, Middleton et al., 2007). These viruses have been detected at a prevalence of around 1% or less, although seroprevalence can be as high as 60% (Breed et al., 2013, Rahman et al., 2013). Given the seasonal and synchronous breeding of these bats, it is difficult to distinguish whether there are seasonal increases in incidence due to infections of susceptible juveniles whose maternal antibodies have waned (Epstein et al., 2013), or changes in bat immunity that enable reinfections or the reactivation of low-level infections (Sohayati et al., 2011).",

Mechanisms of disease tolerance (Schneider and Ayres, 2008) must have some degree of pathogen specificity to maintain immunocompetence. Innate immunity and mechanisms of recognizing viral invasion of cells are an important first line of host defense, and signals downstream of innate immune receptors play a key role in the magnitude of the immune response initiated (Iwasaki, 2012). Viruses can trigger endosomal, cell surface, or cytosolic innate immune receptors in a nucleic-acid-dependent manner (by their whole-genome, replication products or intermediates) or in a nucleic-acid-independent manner by virion glycoproteins or by more general changes associated with cellular stress (Iwasaki, 2012).

Regulatory factors are being identified that contribute to amplifying or dampening signaling pathways downstream of innate receptors and impact the type and amount of cytokines produced (Qian and Cao, 2013). In addition, the existence of genetic heterogeneity within and between populations is emerging as an important factor contributing to host variation in innate immune responses to infection and susceptibility to disease (Lee et al., 2014, Pothlichet and Quintana-Murci, 2013). In contrast, an understanding of variation in quantitative parameters, such as measures of maximum response, half-maximal effective concentration, the dose of stimuli at which a response is initiated, the kinetics of the response, and the total magnitude of the response (by measures such as area under the curve), is still lagging behind, even in humans and mice, and may well turn out to be a critical aspect in explaining differences between hosts. Ultimately, heterogeneity in qualitative and quantitative aspects of an immune response and the selection pressure exerted by specific pathogens shapes the innate immune system of a species and thus impacts responses to future encounters with novel infectious agents (Barreiro and Quintana-Murci, 2010), as well as perhaps baseline cellular states (for which the relevant measures are not always clear). Yet, species-specific differences in responses to immune stimuli are only beginning to be described (Barreiro et al., 2010, Brinkworth et al., 2012, Seok et al., 2013).",

Alternatively, inhibiting specific ISGs found to be activated in non-natural hosts but that are quiescent in natural hosts may reduce downstream detrimental proinflammatory effects in infections such as HIV without preventing the antiviral effects of other ISGs induced, rather than blocking type I IFN completely (Sandler et al., 2014, Schoggins et al., 2011).",

Thus, the absence of RIG-I, a sensor of viral RNA ligands, has been hypothesized to make chickens less resistant to influenza viruses as compared to natural bird reservoirs such as ducks (Barber et al., 2010). However, specific innate immune responses may also precipitate immunopathologic consequences. For example, the absence of TLR3 leads to a reduced production of inflammatory mediators and improved survival upon infection with phlebovirus or influenza A viruses, despite similar or increased levels of viral replication (Gowen et al., 2006, Le Goffic et al., 2006). IL-17RA knockout mice infected with influenza A virus also display lower expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reduced lung inflammation, and improved survival despite having higher levels of virus replication as compared to wild-type laboratory inbred mice (Peiris et al., 2010). In addition, studies of different inbred mouse strains that are either susceptible or resistant to influenza-associated mortality have demonstrated greater activation of genes associated with inflammatory responses in susceptible mice and have begun to define the underlying genetic determinants of divergent infection outcomes (Peiris et al., 2010). Importantly, differences in responses between natural and non-natural hosts may not simply be due to the presence or absence of specific receptors or the switching on or off of specific signaling cascades. Rather, in the context of complex immune processes and cellular interactions, even small differences in the magnitude or timing of responses can substantially alter infection outcome. The use of mathematical models and careful measurements of rates of change of key response parameters may be required to ensure that such explanations are not missed.",

Unlike humans infected with HIV, African primates do not develop the severe immune dysfunction and susceptibility to opportunistic infections that characterize AIDS. Pathogenic lentivirus infections in non-natural human or rhesus macaque hosts are associated with an elevated expression of ISGs and increased levels of immune activation, which includes increases in the activation and proliferation of T cells (Moir et al., 2011). During HIV infection, the majority of type I IFN production is likely due to the recognition of HIV by TLR7 expressed by pDCs (Beignon et al., 2005). However, in marked contrast to pathogenic HIV and SIV infections, an ISG expression signature is absent in sooty mangabeys during chronic SIV infection (Mandl et al., 2008). Further, chronically SIV-infected sooty mangabeys do not display elevations in aberrant T cell activation and its consequences (Silvestri et al., 2003). Whether the absence of chronic type I IFN production in sooty mangabeys is a result of reduced pDC activation by SIV or a function of actively suppressive mechanisms remains debated (Bosinger et al., 2013, Mandl et al., 2008). In African green monkeys, another reservoir host for SIV, a similar absence of an ISG expression signature during chronic SIV infection has been described (Jacquelin et al., 2009). In addition, SIV infection of African green monkeys is associated with an anti-inflammatory gene expression signature (Kornfeld et al., 2005). Interestingly, baseline cellular activation states, as measured by Ki67 on NK and T cells, are significantly lower in sooty mangabeys and African green monkey reservoir hosts than in the non-natural, AIDS-susceptible rhesus macaque host, though the relevance of this for immune response parameters upon infection has not yet been explored (Mandl et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The situation in hantavirus-infected rodents has some notable parallels to host-virus interactions in SIV-infected primates. Rodents infected with hantavirus do not show signs of disease or of discernable fitness costs (Easterbrook and Klein, 2008, Schountz and Prescott, 2014). As in SIV-infected AGMs, induction of regulatory T cells at later stages of hantavirus infection, while resulting in viral persistence, reduces effector T cell responses and is thought to limit immunopathology (Table 1) (Easterbrook and Klein, 2008, Schountz and Prescott, 2014. Exactly how the switch from initial immune activation to a dampened response is mediated in rodents infected with hantavirus is still unclear. Specific viral proteins may interact with rodent immune pathways to limit proinflammatory responses while at the same time preventing clearance. Alternatively, or in addition, as may be the case for African primates infected with SIV, changes in innate recognition could directly lead to reduced pathology due to the reduction in the production of inflammatory mediators or due to the induction of responses that actively suppress damaging responses. Adaptive immune responses may also play a major role in modulating innate immunity in reservoir hosts. For example, cytokines secreted by activated T cells can activate or suppress innate cells, and antigen-antibody complexes impact innate cell function via Fc receptor signaling. The induction of inhibitory receptors on T cells, such as PD-1, can directly contribute to limiting T-cell-mediated pathology while preventing viral clearance (Barber et al., 2006, Frebel et al., 2012) (Figure 2). Recent data from chronically lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected mice has highlighted that an expanded population of regulatory T cells dampens CD8+ T cell responses and that the depletion of regulatory T cells in conjunction with the blockade of PD-1 signaling substantially reduces viral load (Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2014).",

Therefore, the innate pathways important to sensing viruses with the same genomic composition or replication scheme often overlap substantially (Iwasaki, 2012). It has been hypothesized that viruses sharing cell tropism and features that result in their recognition by the same innate receptor, termed \u201cvirotypes,\u201d will trigger the same host transcriptional response (Virgin, 2014). As a consequence of this, it is possible that changes in a discrete innate pathway predispose certain reservoir hosts to asymptomatically harbor multiple viruses recognized by the same pathway if such changes increase disease tolerance to these virotypes in similar ways. Data from human studies have shown that deficiencies\u2014in particular, innate receptor signaling molecules\u2014can result in very defined and narrow susceptibilities to only a few specific pathogens (Al-Herz et al., 2014). Redundancies in immune recognition explain why reservoir host-pathogen associations might be very specific and thus not impair resistance to other pathogens. Sooty mangabeys, in addition to being reservoirs for SIV, are also natural hosts for yellow fever virus (YFV) and remain disease free upon infection. Studies of immune responses of sooty mangabeys to YFV have shown that, like for SIV, they mount reduced effector T cell responses following YFV infection compared to humans and macaques (Mandl et al., 2011). Both YFV and SIV stimulate type I IFN upon recognition by TLR7, so this raises the intriguing possibility that specific changes in TLR7 signaling in sooty mangabeys impact their adaptive immune responses to these viruses.",

            "text": "Indeed, patterns of reservoir host and viral associations have been observed, but their biological significance is unclear, given the only very recent increase in comprehensive studies of species\u2019 viromes. For instance, bats are the reservoir of several emerging infectious agents, the majority of which are single-stranded RNA viruses, such as SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, rabies, and related lyssaviruses Menangle virus, Marburg, and Ebola viruses (Table 1). Bats may also be the ancient natural host reservoirs of the flavivirus hepatitis C (Quan et al., 2013). Is this merely a result of biases in sampling and analysis, or does the coevolution of a host with one virus of a given virotype open a window to infection with others of the same virotype? Is this a result of life history traits of bats and/or a function of species-specific variations in innate immune recognition of RNA viruses between humans and bats? Some studies have suggested that bats are disproportionately responsible for viral emergence relative to species diversity, but this conclusion and the reasons for the association of bats with zoonotic viruses remain a matter of debate (Luis et al., 2013, Olival et al., 2013). Interestingly, many viruses that cause persistent infections in humans use DNA as genomic material (Virgin et al., 2009). Is this entirely a property of these viruses or a result of a coevolution of our immune response with DNA virotypes that is different in other mammalian species with a distinct history of virus encounters? Zoonotic DNA viruses that cause disease in humans certainly exist, including monkeypox and herpes B viruses. A comparative and immune-centric understanding of virus-host relationships between virotypes and species will be required to investigate such questions. As our data set on host-virus associations increases, so will our ability to discern patterns and investigate their causes.",

The immune system is embedded in the complex physiology of an organism, and as such, infections and the immune responses that they elicit trigger behavioral, autonomic, endocrine, and metabolic effects. Soluble immune mediators like IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 result in \u201csickness behavior,\u201d such as social withdrawal and decreases in food intake and motor activity in infected individuals (Dantzer et al., 2008). Specific changes in metabolism during inflammation can lead to cachexia, which is particularly well documented in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (once termed \u201cconsumption\u201d), or HIV (once termed \u201cslim disease\u201d) infections or to local changes in tissue microenvironment. In turn, metabolic processes and changes in body temperature can impact host immunity. Metabolic byproducts can recruit immune cells to sites of infection, activate innate immune cells via recognition through the pattern recognition receptors, which also sense microbial products, and initiate the resolution of inflammation (Jin et al., 2013, Kominsky et al., 2010). Nutrients, metabolites, and oxygen availability within tissues can impact immune cell effector functions and immune homeostasis (Pearce and Pearce, 2013, Sitkovsky and Lukashev, 2005).",

For instance, bats have evolved unique life history traits that may have influenced their exposure to and interaction with pathogens in ways that have led to distinct virus-host d\u00e9tentes. Bats are capable of sustained flight and have exceptionally long lifespans despite their high metabolic rates and small body size (Wilkinson and South, 2002). Consistent with the idea that changes in energy metabolism were required to meet the extraordinary cost of flight, mitochondrial and nuclear genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation have undergone positive selection in bat lineages (Shen et al., 2010). Concomitant selection pressure on DNA damage repair pathway genes to prevent negative physiological effects of high metabolic rates caused by the release of reactive oxygen species may have had as yet undefined consequences for innate immune responses to viruses (Zhang et al., 2013). Hibernation has also been associated with altered immune cell function and reduced lymphocyte trafficking, an understanding of which could be key to explaining the devastating impact of White-nose syndrome in North American bat populations (Bouma et al., 2010, Meteyer et al., 2012).",

One practical constraint has been establishing colonies of reservoir host species to enable longitudinal experiments under controlled conditions. Immunological field studies, though valuable in specific instances, can be difficult to interpret given that pathogen exposure status between sampling time points is unknown and it may not always be possible to recapture the same individuals. However, keeping reservoir host colonies can require specific animal husbandry techniques, may involve training animals to accept available food sources not eaten in the wild, and can require access to special facilities to maintain the animals (such as aviaries to harbor bats or birds) and to perform infections with viruses that are often lethal to humans. Moreover, importing reservoir hosts from their country of origin can be costly, and quarantines are required to ascertain that they are free of the zoonotic pathogens dangerous to humans. The lack of experimental studies of wildlife reservoirs is also a product of our poor understanding of the true wildlife reservoirs for a number of recently emerged viruses. However, such studies, if conducted correctly, are critical to understanding pathogenesis and the risk of exposure for humans.",

            "text": "A second technical challenge to studies of reservoir host immunity has been the establishment of viral infection models that mimic infection in the wild and that are useful for investigating pathogen kinetics and immune responses over time in a setting where the time of infection is known and other environmental parameters can be controlled (Box 1). Extensive viral passaging in vitro, especially in cells lines that, while permissive for infection, may be quite distinct from cells infected in vivo, can lead to the selection of viral variants that can no longer replicate effectively in the host of origin. Similarly, the use of clonal viruses can be problematic in recapitulating typical outcomes of natural infections should initiation of infection with diverse viral quasispecies be important. As such, the choice of viral inoculum can greatly influence the course of infection. For example, in studies of sooty mangabeys in which highly pathogenic SIV variants passaged in macaques were used, the infection was rapidly controlled, quite unlike the persistent high-level replication seen in natural infections (Kaur et al., 1998). Subsequent infection studies have used plasma samples harvested from SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (Mandl et al., 2008). In other instances, whether experimental infections of reservoir hosts recapitulate features of natural infection in the wild remains to be validated. Infections of bats with Nipah and Hendra viruses resulted in very few bats with detectable levels of viral replication, although in some instances seroconversion was seen nonetheless, and it is unclear whether this very low infection level mimics infections in the wild (Halpin et al., 2011, Middleton et al., 2007). Experimental rabies infections of bat reservoir hosts led to muscle weakness, paralysis, and reductions in body weight and were usually lethal (Turmelle et al., 2010), but it is difficult to extrapolate such studies to an understanding of the mortality rate of rabies in wild bat populations. In fact, epidemiological models of data gathered in field studies suggest that lethality upon rabies infection may be a far rarer outcome in wild bat populations than in the lab (Blackwood et al., 2013). Similarly, whereas LCMV infection of inbred mouse strains is one of the best-studied systems for viral immunity, surprisingly little is known about the immunologic and virologic characteristics of the host-virus interface in wild mouse species that are reservoir hosts for LCMV and other arenaviruses (Table 1) (Wade et al., 2002). Host genetic differences or small changes in the LCMV viral sequence can affect whether infections are chronic or acute (Ahmed et al., 1988). In addition, vertical transmission can lead to the establishment of a life-long viral carrier state with little adaptive immune responses raised. The dependence on the host-pathogen balance established on both strain and route of infection means that, without much information on this, it is currently difficult to extrapolate insights from laboratory experiments to infections of mice in the wild.",

For instance, the expression of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the host cell receptor used by MERS coronovirus, in mice using adenovirus vector-mediated transduction successfully rendered mice susceptible to infection with MERS coronavirus (Zhao et al., 2014). In the case in which mice are permissive for infection but distinct host responses lead to only mild disease, the genetic traits contributing to disease susceptibility differences can be explored using a set of well-defined recombinant inbred mouse strains, the Collaborative Cross (Churchill et al., 2004), as was recently done for Ebola virus infection (Rasmussen et al., 2014).",

Furthermore, comparative analyses can highlight genomic regions with changes of possible relevance to disease outcome upon infection and can generate hypotheses that can be tested further.

Our knowledge of innate immunity enables us to make reasonable guesses as to which types of innate receptors might be relevant to the host-pathogen interface of particular viruses. This is particularly useful when the pathogen in question requires biosafety level 4 laboratories, thus making direct infection studies challenging. Together with the methods outlined above, it is now possible to determine which genes change their expression early on in response to the administration of, for instance, defined TLR agonists targeting the specific TLRs involved in innate recognition of the virus of interest. We can characterize specific gene circuits and their temporal regulation, comparing responses to what is seen in more well-studied species in that regard. It is also possible to measure differences in basal gene expression levels, as well as quantitative changes in response to different doses of relevant stimuli to obtain measures of the dynamic range of the response, the dose at which a response is initiated, and its duration. In addition, innate immunity can be probed in cross-sectional studies of animals, which can provide information on how infection itself can modulate immune responsiveness.",

            "text": "Given the threats to human health and economic development posed by emerging viral diseases, better understanding the nature and diversity of mechanisms responsible for the ability of reservoir hosts to tolerate viral infections and facilitate transmission to other host species is critical. Studies to date have focused primarily on viral detection and diversity, rather than on illuminating the nature of the host-virus equilibrium extant in their wild animal reservoirs. Achieving the goal of a holistic approach to understanding viral emergence will require the integration of immunological studies with investigations of animal physiology and metabolism, as well as the synthesis of such studies with epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights of viral emergence. Cross-disciplinary collaborations between mechanism-targeted immunology and microbiology laboratories, veterinarians with experience in establishing colonies of wild species, and ecologists able to perform in-country field studies will be especially important in advancing our knowledge in this field. The enormous value of cross-geographical and interdisciplinary initiatives in understanding viral emergence has already been demonstrated by programs such as PREDICT, established by the U.S. Agency for International Development to detect emerging pandemic threats in partnership with local governments and scientists (Morse et al., 2012). It is also apparent in other cross-continental research teams\u2019 efforts, such as the multinational collaboration that promptly tracked the emergence and evolution of the Ebola virus variants responsible for the ongoing outbreak in West Africa (Gire et al., 2014). The development of immunological reagents, in addition to the application of recently developed methods to define host genome sequences and to characterize patterns of host gene expression following infection or other experimental intervention, will yield valuable insights into immune responses elicited by emerging viruses in their natural hosts. Such studies may identify important pathways of pathogenesis in humans by elucidating why these infections result in such distinct infection outcomes in natural hosts and may indicate novel approaches for the treatment and prevention of zoonotic infections. They may also establish whether there are fundamental immunologic reasons\u2014in addition to proposed behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary ones\u2014to explain why certain animals, including bats, primates, and rodents, are most often implicated as the reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses. Finally, studies of reservoir hosts stand to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental immunological processes contributing to host resistance and disease tolerance.",

Transmission of zoonotic viruses may be more likely in cases in which there are persistently high viral loads or repeated acute infections of reservoir hosts. Within a population of the reservoir host, repeated infections with a pathogen may occur as a result of waning immunological memory within individuals, circulation of diverse strains to which there is minimal cross-reactive immunity, or the introduction of new susceptible individuals (juveniles). To what extent and in which instances features of the immune response in reservoir hosts contribute to pathogen maintenance in a population is an important open question.",
