The viral envelope (E) protein, the principal surface protein of viral particles, plays a vital role in viral entry and fusion. In this study, two peptides derived from domain II (DII) and the stem of the TMUV envelope protein, TP1 and TP2, respectively, were tested for their antiviral activity. TP1 and TP2 inhibited TMUV infection in BHK-21 cells, and their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 14.19 mg/L and 7.64 mg/L, respectively. Viral inhibition assays in different cell lines of avian origin showed that the inhibitory effects of TP1 and TP2 are not cell type dependent. Moreover, TP2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. The two peptides inhibited antibody-mediated TMUV infection of duck peripheral blood lymphocytes.",

Among these viral proteins, the envelope (E) protein is located on the surface of mature virions and forms head-to-tail homodimers (Kuhn et al., 2002) . The E protein consists of an ectodomain (containing three domains: DI, DII and DIII) and a stem-transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the membrane. The first step in the process by which TMUV enters host cells is binding of the E protein to cellular receptors on the cell surface (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010) . To date, several cellular receptors have been identified; these include glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) on BHK-21 cells, heat shock protein A9 on DF-1 cells and heparin sulfate on both BHK-21 and duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) (Zhao et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019) . These receptors play an important role in the first step of TMUV entry and viral attachment. Subsequently, attached TMUV enters cells by the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, after which endocytic vesicles carrying the virus are delivered to endosomes (Smit et al., 2011) . Under the low-pH conditions of the endosome, the E homodimer dissociates into monomeric proteins, exposing the fusion loop in DII.",

Biotin-TP1 or biotin-TP2 at increasing concentrations increased the signals indicating binding to the TMUV that had been coated on the plates in a concentration-dependent manner, but signals from negative peptide and non-enveloped TMUV were very low (Fig 5A) . The binding between TMUV and the peptides was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig 5B) . These results verified the direct interaction between biotin-peptides and TMUV. Lok et al. (2012) reported that the inhibitory peptide DN59 could inhibit DENV by interacting with virions and inducing the release of viral genomic RNA. Here, the release of viral genomic RNA induced by the interaction between TMUV and the peptides was investigated by exposing peptide-treated virions to RNase digestion. The RNase digestion assay showed that genomic RNA released from TMUV virions co-incubated with TP1 at increasing doses was sensitive to micrococcal nuclease. Approximately 33.7% of the genomic RNA released by TMUV virions treated with 100 mg/L TP1 was degraded by RNase.",

Therefore, a virus binding inhibition assay was conducted to investigate the mechanism by which TP2 inhibited TMUV infection. The results demonstrated that treatment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with either TP1 or TP2 prevented TMUV from binding cells. Costin et al. (2010) reported that the surface of DENV particles changed from smooth to rough and that DENV particles lost their icosahedral symmetry after incubation with the peptides DN57opt and 1OAN1. This structural deformation probably interfered with cell binding. Alhoot et al. (2013) demonstrated that the inhibitory peptides DET2 and DET4 caused structural abnormalities and altered the arrangement of the viral E protein, which interfered with viral binding and entry. TP1 and TP2 are likely to interfere with viral attachment by a mechanism similar to that described above. Nevertheless, the idea that the decrease in TMUV attachment after incubation with TP1 was due to the release of the genome cannot be excluded. Thus, further research to elucidate the precise mechanism of the inhibitory effects of TP1 and TP2 is needed.",

In addition, unlike most small-molecule antiviral drugs, the nontoxicity of TP1 and TP2 also ensures the safety of these peptide inhibitors for antiviral therapy.

It is presumed that the binding of TP1 to TMUV inactivates TMUV virions and hence relieves ADE-mediated TMUV infection. In addition, TP1 and TP2 were shown to interfere with the cellular binding of TMUV. It is possible that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f these two inhibitory peptides block ADE by reducing viral binding to cells. These conjectures still require further experimental confirmation. This is the first report on peptide inhibitors of TMUV infection derived from the E protein. TP1 and TP2 exhibited effective anti-TMUV activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, TP2 cross-inhibited JEV infection in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, both peptides could block ADE in vitro. TP1 functions through a mechanism that involves release of the viral genome and interference with cellular TMUV binding, while TP2 might be an interference factor between TMUV and the cell. These findings suggest that TP1 and TP2",
