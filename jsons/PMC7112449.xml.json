However, there\nare still many real spreading processes which can not be described well by this\nassumption.32 Therefore, a contact\nprocess (CP) model with identical infectivity is proposed to study the epidemic spreading in\ncomplex networks.33 Almost all studies in\nCP are focused on dynamical processes and phase transitions,32\u201342 but the\npredictability of the model is totally overlooked. To this end, we study how the structures\nof distinct networks (i.e., homogeneous, heterogeneous, and community networks) influence\nthe variabilities of epidemic patterns in CP. Through numerical experiments, we find that\nthe community structures can remarkably influence the prevalence and its variability,\ncontrary to non-community networks (i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous networks). It is\nworth noting that it\u2019s hard for the extraordinarily large variability in a local community\nto predict the epidemic prevalence.",

By using a numerical approach in this section, we\nanalyze the variabilities of outbreaks generated by different sets of initial nodes, both\nfor random graphs and scale-free networks with the same network size and average degree.\nConsidering the fact that the results of a particular network can be generalized to any\ninstances of network model,19 the\nnumerical simulations we studied here are run in one network. In Fig. 1, we show the curves i(t) and\n\u0394[i(t)]\ncomputed for the different disease models in both RG and SFN. For SI model in Fig. 1(a), the density of infected\ni(t) in RG reaches its stationary state faster than that\nin SFN; for SIS model in Fig. 1(b), the stationary\ni(t) in RG is greater than that in SFN; for SIR model in\nFig. 1(c), RG has the higher peak prevalence. Contrary\nto the results for the case of contacting all neighbors, it is first discovered that the\nheterogeneous structure can slow down the prevalence of outbreaks in CP. Because hubs may be\ncontacted many times by their neighboring nodes at each time step, the total contact ability\n(i.e., the actual number of contacting nodes at one time step) of SFN is reduced further\naccordingly; as a result, the hub effect holds back the prevalence of diseases.\nMeaningfully, owing to the limited contact ability of CP, the infected densities starting\nfrom the initial infected nodes (seeds) with different degrees are almost the same in SFN,\nwhich is distinct from the results for the case of contacting all neighbors.19\n",

Therefore, in this section, we study the variability of CP in a very simple\ncommunity network, where two RGs are connected randomly by only one link. Obviously, this\nnetwork has a strong strength of community structure. In order to normalize the terms of\ncommunity network, we define the link as weak tie50 and call two nodes connected by this link \u201cbridgeness.\u201d51 We first investigate the time evolution\nof epidemics generated by different seeds staying away from the bridgeness, and it is\nnoted that there is only one initial seed in each realization. From Figs. 2(a)\u20132(c), we can get that the closer the seed\nto the bridgeness, the epidemic spreads much faster in the global network, and among all\ncases, the epidemic starting at the bridgeness spreads fastest. For SI model, the further\ndistance to the bridgeness such as d = 3, 4 induces two periods of the\nquickly rising trend at the beginning time t = 10, 30, respectively. If\nthe initial seed is far away from the bridgeness, the disease will be restricted in the\nfirst community for a long time till the bridgeness infected, in which almost all nodes is\ninfected. As a result, the outbreak in the second community just starts at that moment the\nprevalence in the first community get towards the end, which causes the second outbreak.\nIn the case of SIS and SIR model, the recovery mechanism reduces this phenomenon occurred;\nfor instance, there is the tiny second peak of the prevalence for d = 3,\n4 in Fig. 2(c). From the above, it is found that the\nbridgeness plays a distinctly important role in the rapid transmission of information in\nCP.",

In particular, at\nthe beginning of outbreaks, the variability for the case of d = 4 reaches\nabout 50, which is 100 times the maximum value 0.5 in the global network. Second, the\ncloser distance of the seed to bridgeness, the lower level of variability it has in the\nlocal community. In particular, the maximum variability value for the case of the\nbridgeness is only about 1, which is much less than 50 for the case of\nd = 4. Thus, the bridgeness plays a significant role in enhancing the\npredictability that the closer initial seed to the bridgeness, the more accurate the\npredictability is. Third, each curve of variabilities can be divided into four parts: the\nsudden drop stage, the relatively stable stage, the slowing-down stage, and the final\nstage of outbreaks (i.e., the exponential decay stage for SI model, the steady state stage\nfor SIS model, and the sharp increase stage for SIR model, respectively). The first stage\nis originated from the uncertain arrival time of disease, with the increase of the arrival\nrate, the variability decreases. The second stage (10 < t < 20 in\nmost cases) is induced by the interplay between the outbreak and the arrival of diseases\nin massive realizations: on one hand, the outbreaks in some realizations upgrade the\nvariability; on the other hand, the increase of the arrival rate counteracts this effect.\nAs the infection density is close to saturated, the variability will enter the\nslowing-down stage. What is noteworthy is that the minimum variability value just\ncorresponds to the peak value of prevalence for SIR model.

First, we find that the variability difference between homogeneous and\nheterogeneous networks is very narrow, although the heterogeneous structure induces a\nlighter prevalence. Second, two peaks of both the prevalence and variability are shown in\nthe community network. It is noted that in the local community, the extraordinarily large\nvariability in early stage of the outbreak makes the prediction of disease spreading hard.\nThis result is in accordance with Ref. 53 in which\nthe networks with strong community structures are of weak synchronizability, and the\namplitudes of the time series in the local communities are much larger than that in the\nglobal networks. Fortunately, the bridgeness plays a significant role in enhancing the\npredictability, the closer initial seed to the bridgeness, the more accurate the\npredictability is. This result suggests that bridgenesses may be the ideal detection\nstations in community networks. Moreover, the different reaction mechanisms of disease\nmodels can result in the distinct variabilities. Especially for the case of SIR model, the\ngreater and greater variabilities are observed at the end of the epidemics for the different\nlifetimes of the epidemics in various realizations.",
