            "text": "As the working population of the United States ages (Gonzales et al. 2015), it can be expected that a larger number of licensed social workers will remain employed beyond the age of 60. Yet we know very little about social workers\u2019 productive aging or the personal and professional issues faced by them as they grow older. The purpose of this paper is to examine the demographic and background factors, self-described behavioral and physical health problems, and workplace issues experienced by more than 800 employed licensed social workers aged 60 and over, and to determine if and how these variables differ from their younger colleagues. Many studies have indicated that social work practice, especially when workers routinely interact with clients experiencing trauma, can be very stressful emotionally and can lead to secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue, and burnout for the workers (e.g. Bride 2007; Caringi et al. 2017; Johnson et al. 2005; Pelon 2017). With this in mind, it is important to learn how older social workers, who have often been working in the field for many years, view the stresses as well as the value of their work in comparison to their younger colleagues. Such knowledge could then inform ways to support older social workers as they continue working. While there is some debate as to what defines the lower boundary of the \u201caging\u201d population, the cutoff age agreed to by the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for \u201colder or elderly persons\u201d is 60 years and over (WHO 2018, p. 1). This is also the age set by the Older Americans Act (Butler 2010) and is the cutoff age used by the researchers in this study.",

They note that definitions of productive aging differ in scope with some solely focusing on activities with economic worth, while others incorporate a broader range of behaviors. As an example of a more economically-focused conceptualization of productive aging, Caro, Bass, and Chen (as cited in Bass and Caro 2001) stated that productive aging \u201crefers to any activity by an older individual that contributes to producing goods and services, or develops the capacity to produce them (whether or not the individual is paid for this activity)\u201d (p. 39). However, Kaye et al. (2003) advocate for a definition that not only focuses on activities such as paid and volunteer work, but also includes \u201cbehaviors that are inner directed, personally meaningful, and satisfying\u201d (p. 203). A more recent definition by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2011) states that \u201cproductive aging is an approach that emphasizes the positive aspects of growing older\u201d (p. 1). The CDC\u2019s approach to productive aging focuses on the importance of organizational strategies tailored to meet the changing needs of workers across the life-span. Among the attributes of CDC\u2019s approach to productive aging is a life-span perspective that \u201cconsiders the patterns of change and transition that occur in different domains (e.g., biological/physical, cognitive, social) from the first day on the job to the last\u201d (CDC 2011, p. 1).",

(2015), \u201cthere is growing evidence that employment itself actively yields both physical and mental health benefits\u201d for older adults (pp. 45\u201346). They note that working into older age improves cognitive, social, and emotional functioning, as well as delaying the use of savings, pensions, and other benefits. However, these authors state that older workers can experience vocational challenges pertaining to physical strength and health issues, gaps in their ability to use technology, and commitment to work. Bouville et al. (2018) research in France found that older workers had higher absenteeism than younger workers, and identified factors that influenced this relationship. Hsu\u2019s (2019) study in Taiwan found that work conditions are an important determinant in workers\u2019 engagement at the workplace and their decision to continue working into later adulthood. Hsu also found that younger cohorts scored at higher levels of both interpersonal and workplace stress than the older-aged groups.",

However, while some have found a positive linear relationship between age and work satisfaction (e.g. Ng and Feldman 2010), others have shown a curvilinear relationship between these variables, with younger and older workers demonstrating greater job satisfaction than midlife workers (e.g. Hochwarter et al. 2001). Zacher and Schmitt (2016) reviewed numerous studies regarding occupational wellbeing that have demonstrated ways in which age is a moderating variable for the effects of different work factors, and ways in which work factors are moderating variables for the effects of age. For example, Besen et al. (2013) found that in a sample of over 2000 U.S. workers, the positive relationships between job satisfaction and work autonomy, skill variety, and co-worker friendships declined as the age of employees increased.",

            "text": "Research regarding older social workers appears to be extremely limited. A review of existing literature found studies examining burnout among helping professionals, with findings indicating that burnout decreases with age and years of work experience (Steel et al. 2015). However, Schwartz et al. (2007) found that this relationship held only for those working in private practice, with no differences in burnout over the years for those working in public agencies. In addition, studies have examined compassion satisfaction (CS) as it relates to the age of social workers and other helping professionals (Howard et al. 2015; Kelly et al. 2015). CS has been defined as the positive feelings one obtains from being involved in the healing process of other individuals (Kulkarni et al. 2013). Research studies indicate that the older a helping professional is, the greater their level of CS (Sacco et al. 2015). Craig and Sprang (2010) found that among a sample of social workers and psychologists specializing in trauma work, age and number of years of work experience tended to result in lower rates of burnout and compassion fatigue, and higher rates of CS, while Lawson and Myers\u2019 (2011) study of professional counselors found that younger counselors had significantly lower CS scores. Kulkarni et al. (2013) also found that the number of years of experience in the field was positively correlated with CS. The previously mentioned study by Steel et al. (2015) on burnout among mental health professionals pointed to age (specifically chronological age, not work experience) as a buffer against depersonalization and cynicism. This suggests that age can be a protective factor in the workplace, particularly among clinicians working directly with clients.",

The study had three central aims:To provide an overview of selected demographic factors, wellness factors, practice factors, and feelings about being a social worker for respondents 60 years of age and older as compared to those under age 60;To determine whether there were differences in compassion satisfaction and workplace stress between the age cohorts when stratified according to gender, race, sexual orientation, presence of mental health problems, and presence of serious physical health problems;After controlling for selected demographic, wellness, and practice factors in a multivariate analysis, to examine how age (age 60 and older vs. under age 60) affects respondents\u2019 compassion satisfaction, workplace stress, and whether or not respondents feel glad that they chose social work as a profession and feel valued as a professional in society.",

Licensing boards in 13 states responded affirmatively, and valid email addresses were obtained for 69,661 licensed social workers in those states. Half of these, 34,831, were randomly selected to take part in a 75-item online survey asking about their perceptions and feelings regarding their physical health, mental health and substance use issues, their work satisfaction and workplace stress, their perceptions of their work environment, their feelings about being a social worker, and demographic information (including the respondents\u2019 age). The 13 states included in this study represent the four federal regions as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau, including the Northeast (Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island), the South (Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and West Virginia), the Midwest (Minnesota and Ohio), and the West (New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming). Usable data were obtained from 6112 licensed social workers (representing a response rate of 28%). Five respondents were randomly selected to receive a $200 Amazon gift card as an incentive. The study\u2019s procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of the two academic institutions represented by the researchers.",

Furthermore, since the researchers wished to investigate the responses of licensed social workers who were currently employed in the profession, 580 surveys of participants who reported that they were not currently working as a social worker were eliminated from the analyses. This reduced the sample size to 4946. More specifically, the experiences of 870 licensed social workers age 60 and older were compared to those of 4076 licensed social workers under the age of 60.",

The older workers consistently reported higher levels of compassion satisfaction than the younger workers for every demographic and wellness factor. However, while the non-stratified analysis indicated that younger social workers experienced more workplace stress than their older counterparts, stratified analyses suggest that these age differences may not hold for some subsamples examined. Specifically, while younger White social workers reported higher workplace stress levels than their older counterparts, there was no significant difference between older and younger non-White social workers for this variable. Similarly, although the age difference in workplace stress was statistically significant among respondents who identified as heterosexual, this was not the case for those who identified as a sexual minority. However, this could have been due to the small sample of sexual minorities, particularly for the older social worker group. In addition, among those with current mental health problems, there was no difference in workplace stress between the older and younger groups. However, among those with no current mental health problems, the younger group reported higher workplace stress. Table 4 also indicates that older participants reported statistically significant lower levels of workplace stress than the younger participants among males, females, those who reported serious physical health problems, and those who did not report serious physical health problems.",

They also perceived their work environments and the social work profession more favorably. Although there have been a lack of studies correlating compassion satisfaction with working alliance or therapeutic outcomes, numerous studies have found that compassion satisfaction is inversely correlated with secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue and burnout among helping professionals working with clients affected by traumatic issues (e.g. Collins and Long 2003; Harr et al. 2014; Pelon 2017). Furthermore, a study of social workers by Wagaman et al. (2015) and a large study of physicians (Gleichgerrcht and Decety 2013) found that compassion satisfaction was positively correlated with the ability to empathize, indicating that older social workers may be a very valuable resource in working with clients in general, as well as in being able to handle the difficulties of working with clients in traumatic situations.

Furthermore, the response rate was only 28%. This raises the issue of the generalizability of the findings to the greater social work population. Second, in this cross-sectional study, it is not possible to determine the impact of cohort and period effects when examining the differences found between the older and younger respondents. Third, the data may reflect response bias since some participants may not have responded truthfully to stigmatizing personal questions such as those focusing on their mental health and substance misuse. Last, given the lack of literature on the topics discussed, it is difficult to compare the findings of this study to any other research on the growing population of older social workers.",

Among the aging population in the United States are licensed social workers, many of whom will remain in the workforce as they become older. The results of this study demonstrate that social workers who remain in the profession after age 60 have higher levels of compassion satisfaction and more positive attitudes towards both having chosen social work as a profession and their current work environments than their younger counterparts. However, given the lack of literature on aging social workers, more research is greatly needed. Studies should explore the differences in characteristics between the older social workers who remain in the workforce compared to those who are no longer employed, whether by choice or necessity. Studies are also needed regarding what workplace factors or changes in the work environment would allow for more social workers to continue in their productive work roles as they age. To make full use of a productive aging workforce, much more research about social workers and their workplaces needs to be performed in the future.",
