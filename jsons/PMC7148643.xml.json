Along with New York City and Los Angeles, it was one of the first cities to diagnose AIDS cases, but compared with these other cities, it experienced a much greater burden of disease because it had a markedly smaller population with a much higher concentration of gay and bisexual men. By 1983, a disease that had been unheard of just two years earlier had already affected 469 people in San Francisco and killed 182 of them. In a city of less than 750 000 inhabitants with a population of gay and bisexual men of approximately 58 000, AIDS had become the dominant issue.",

In 1977 San Francisco became the first American city to elect an openly gay Supervisor/City Councilperson to office, Harvey Milk. When he was fatally shot, along with pro-gay Mayor George Moscone, in 1978, it further galvanized the gay community. A Milk supporter and an openly gay man, Harry Britt, was appointed by then Mayor Dianne Feinstein. He won re-election in 1979. Since that time San Francisco has always had at least one openly gay member on its Board of Supervisors; at times there have been as many as three gay and lesbian members of the 11 member body.",

At first the Department\u2019s response to AIDS was primarily through the Bureau of Disease Control, where the epidemiology staff tracked the epidemic. But as the need for services and prevention intervention efforts became paramount, the San Francisco Department of Health created the AIDS Office in 1983 with eight staff members. The Department decided to create a separate AIDS Office primarily because the rest of the Department could not move fast enough to handle the tremendous needs of this emerging infection. By the time I became Director of the Office in 1992, the Office had grown to about 90 staff members and had a budget of US$43 million. When I left the Office in 1997, the budget was up to US$73 million and over 100 people worked there.",

Being told that something could not be done in the county system was seen as a challenge and not as a deterrent; achieving the bureaucratically impossible task was a rite of passage for each staff member.",

This has now become the dominant paradigm in the Department as a whole. For example, when we wanted to provide a more coordinated pre-hospital care system in San Francisco for residents calling 911, we convened a series of meetings in 1995 with Health Department paramedics, firefighters, private ambulance providers, union leaders, emergency room doctors and nurses, and citizen representatives. For many of the participants, the philosophy of inclusiveness and the methods of consensus building that we had practiced regularly at the AIDS Office for several years, were new. Committee members were surprised at the willingness of the Department to let the process choose the new configuration for pre-hospital care, and even more delighted when they found they could reach consensus, despite several years of bickering, about the best way to configure services.",

In fact, it was largely based on our success in providing supportive housing (i.e. housing with on-site supportive services such as case management, substance treatment) for people with AIDS, that our health department developed a supportive housing program for people with other medical illnesses. We have found that using a supportive housing model we have been able to take people suffering from mental illness, substance abuse, and other chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) directly from the street and place them. Because this group has high medical costs when they are homeless, we have found supportive housing programs to be extremely cost effective: a month of housing costs less than a single day in our acute care hospital. The programs have also been able to retain two-thirds of clients in housing for two years or more.",

Confidentiality concerns precluded population-based sampling. Because of the long latency period between HIV seroconversion and development of AIDS, estimated at a median of 10 years, neither AIDS reporting nor HIV antibody tests were an effective means of determining where recent infections were occurring (Rutherford, 1990). Nonetheless, these challenges led to the development of creative surveillance models. Often in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we developed a variety of surveillance tools including phone surveys, clinic-based surveys, venue-based surveys, blinded seroprevalence studies, and, in more recent years, the sensitive/less sensitive \u2018detuned\u2019 ELISA, to provide detailed data on the epidemic. We also did specialized studies to focus on small, hidden populations that were never represented in sufficient number in countywide surveys. For example, we conducted surveys of young men who have sex with men (Valleroy et al., 2000), transgendered individuals (Clements-Nolle et al., 2001), and homeless youth (Gleghorn et al., 1998). As Buehler has noted, the use of multiple surveillance methods to characterize the AIDS epidemic has informed efforts on how to maintain surveillance for emerging infections as well as chronic diseases (Buehler, 2003).",

To prevent inadvertent disclosures of HIV status and to encourage at-risk people to test for HIV, the United States and other Western countries set up anonymous testing sites. Because testing is anonymous, it cannot be reported to health departments in the way that laboratories and clinicians report other communicable diseases. Therefore, any further action depends on the willingness of the client to disclose their result.

San Francisco\u2019s gay community was able to drive the new HIV infection rate down from a high of 8000 infections per year in 1983 to 5000 new infections by 1987 (Katz, 1997). What was especially remarkable about the success of this intervention is that it was done with relatively little government funding. While the government was stupefyingly slow in recognizing and funding prevention efforts (Francis, 1992), the community came together to prevent new infections (Shilts, 1987).",

There were constant reminders of the need to stay safe from posters in windows of local stores and safe-sex brochures. Fundraisers were sponsored, and political work and lobbying efforts were carried out. Condom and Bleach man paraded through the streets at street fairs and festivals. (Interestingly, we have reused the concept recently to counter an increase in syphilis cases among men who have sex with men. We introduced the character the Healthy Penis along with his nemesis Phil the syphilis sore at the Gay Pride Parade to raise awareness of the growing number of cases.) The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (a group of men dressed in nuns\u2019 habits) dispensed safe-sex advice along with condoms.

Why should focusing on HIV/AIDS exclusively, rather than using HIV/AIDS as an opportunity to highlight the broader problems with our health system be effective? The major reason is that it is much harder to provide the resources necessary to fix the health system, so that all people suffering from life-threatening diseases (AIDS in the era prior to the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy) or chronic diseases (AIDS in the era post development of effective therapy) receive the treatment they need. For example, the Ryan White (CARE) Act pays for a number of services \u2013 case management, substance abuse, transportation and housing \u2013 that people who suffer from diseases of equal severity are not able to access. Sometimes this produces ironic discrepancies in availability of care. For example, because of the success of HIV/AIDS advocacy in producing funding through the Ryan White CARE Act as well as local and state funding sources, I can arrange a residential substance treatment bed or a methadone maintenance slot within a day for one of my injection drug-using HIV-infected patients. However, for one of my uninfected injection drug-using patients, the wait for these services is several months. The irony of course is that substance treatment could potentially prevent the uninfected person from becoming infected. This discrepancy in funding availability has been referred to as \u2018AIDS exceptionalism\u2019 and has placed AIDS programs open to being attacked as unjust or unfair to other stigmatized populations with serious disease (e.g. mentally ill people) (Casarett and Lantos, 1998).",

For example, many of the successes of HIV/AIDS activism can be attributed to the formation of ACT UP groups in several major cities in the United States and Europe. ACT UP stands for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power and was formed in New York City in 1987 by activist Larry Kramer (Valdiserri, 2003). The civil disobedience tactics of these groups \u2013 closing bridges, sit-ins at governmental offices, booing speakers so that they could not be heard \u2013 while upsetting to some, unquestionably brought attention and results. This strategy was also made more successful by having other AIDS activists participate in advisory groups in more conventional ways. Agreeing to follow the recommendations of the more \u2018moderate\u2019 elements became a way of avoiding having to deal with the more extreme part of ACT UP. The effect of this \u2018good cop/bad cop\u2019 was seen in almost every facet of the struggle against AIDS. In fact, even the very definition of AIDS was heavily influenced by activism. Activists were rightly concerned that the surveillance definition used by the CDC was too narrow, with the result that many people were dying of AIDS without being counted. As a result, the 1992 expansion of the AIDS definition included three indicator diagnoses which were thought to be particularly common among disenfranchised people with HIV: recurrent bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and cervical cancer (CDC, 1992; Buehler, 2003).",

If it was raised at all, it was usually in the context of caring for people who spoke a different language than the provider. But now we understand that language is only one part of cultural competency and health care institutions routinely assess themselves for cultural competency and seek to improve in those areas where they fall short. Part of the impetus for focusing on cultural competency is that it is a good business strategy (i.e. enables you to attract and keep customers) and it improves office morale and minimizes the risk for the employer of workplace harassment suits.",

Perhaps the most telling (and disturbing) sign is how much less visible HIV/AIDS issues are in epicenters, such as San Francisco and New York.

To date, most of the costs of AIDS drugs have been covered via a combination of federal and state funding through the Medicaid program and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). ADAP is funded through the Ryan White Care Act. In 2003, the funding for ADAP (federal and state) was US$948 million (http://www.hab.hrsa.gov/programs/factsheets/adap1.htm), up from US$204 million in 1996, the year that protease inhibitors first became available. In addition to these increases in funding, several cost-savings methods have been applied including use of a variety of pharmaceutical discount programs. Unfortunately, despite these increases in funding and cost savings measures, ADAP funding is insufficient to cover demand for medications. The result is that many states in the United States effectively ration medications to economically poor, uninsured people with HIV/AIDS by maintaining wait lists, limiting the total number of drugs a person with HIV/AIDS can receive, or restricting the formulary (not including all effective drugs on the formulary). As these restrictions increase, we could see a greater and greater disparity by income in the percentage of HIV-infected people receiving treatment and decreased survival among low-income populations due to them being less likely to receive treatment (McFarland et al., 2003).",

Instead all people with serious illness would have access to needed medications. Similarly, were the same support services available for disenfranchised populations or those who have to navigate a difficult treatment system, we would not need services only for people with HIV/AIDS.
