For this reason, different antigens appear similar to the immune system, thereby challenging the theoretical specificity postulated by the clonal selection theory. To understand this issue, it is useful to distinguish between cross-neutralization and cross-protection. In cross-neutralization, antibodies elicited by vaccination with a certain serotype neutralize other serotypes in vitro. Cross-protection means that immunization with a certain vaccine type provides clinically significant protection against infection or disease (or both) owing to another serotype, i.e., that the cross-neutralizing response has a functional impact.",

However, if we look at the phylogenetic tree that includes the various HPV types, we observe that some degree of cross-protection is possible, given the high level of homology of some viral types with vaccine types. This is the case, for instance, for HPV-31 and -35 (strictly related to HPV-16), and for HPV-45 (strictly related to HPV-18). Another example can be seen with rotavirus vaccines. The antibodies elicited by these vaccines not only protect against those circulating strains sharing the same G or P variant as that contained in the vaccine strain, but also other non-matching G and P strains (heterotypic protection). According to this, type-specific antibodies targeted at neutralizing VP7 or VP4 epitopes are not solely responsible for their protective effect. The comparable effectiveness of RV1 and RV5 reinforces this conclusion: neutralizing antibody titers induced by RV1 or RV5 consistently underestimates the protection conferred by the vaccine. Other examples of this cross-reactivity have been confirmed in humans, involving influenza virus-specific immunity, or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, among others.",

            "text": "Cross-protection was described five decades ago and later termed \n. The initial observation was that CD8+ - T cells are able to cross-recognize peptides from two distinct viruses and may play roles not only in protective immunity, but also in immunopathology (autoimmunity). According to this phenomenon, memory T cells that are specific to one pathogen can become activated during infection with an unrelated heterologous pathogen. As such, previous host exposure to unrelated infectious agents can greatly alter immune response to an infection. T cells recognize processed peptides that are presented at the cell surface in antigen-binding grooves of class I major histocompatibility class (MHC) proteins. At the same time, the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to the peptide-MHC complex. Thus, a TCR that recognizes a given MHC-presented peptide may also recognize other peptides that fit into the appropriate MHC groove, and has amino acid chains that are able to bind to TCR. This degeneration of the T-cell recognition is called when the cross-reactive peptide has similar determinants and interacts with TCR in the same manner as the original peptide. It is called alternative recognition when different determinants of the TCR are involved in recognition. A third explanation for cross-reactivity is when a given T cell expresses two different TCRs as a result of an incomplete allelic exclusion of a second TCR chain; in this way, the two distinct TCRs formed may recognize different antigens.",

However, very recently, cross-protective immunity has also been highlighted as one of the mechanisms for the unexpected beneficial effects of BCG vaccination on infections other than tuberculosis. Researchers showed that BCG vaccination induces a long-lasting, nonspecific potentiation effect of heterologous T-helper responses, Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Th17 (IL-17 and IL-22), to non-mycobacterial stimulation. Previously, other authors had demonstrated that both effector and memory CD8+ cells had the potential to secrete IFN-gamma in the absence of related antigens. According to these findings, vaccination can provide not only a heterosubtypic protection, but also heterologous protection through a cross-immunity mechanism.",

When a given proportion of the population \u2013 known as the herd immunity threshold \u2013 becomes immunized, the disease may no longer persist in this population. This threshold is defined based on the \u201cbasic reproduction number\u201d (R\n0), which represents the number of people in an unprotected population that could receive the disease from one infected individual. The more contagious the disease, the higher this number, and thus the higher the threshold to be reached to protect the community. For example, measles, an extremely contagious disease, has a threshold of 95% to ensure community protection. On the other hand, mumps, which is not as contagious, needs a threshold of 80% (\u25d8 Fig. 1.2, \u25d8 Table 1.2).\n\n",

The paradox is that for an individual, with regard to vaccination in a population, the best option is that everybody else is vaccinated and the individual is not. This way the individual is protected from infection because of the herd effect, but suffers none of the potential adverse effects of vaccination. Finally, these indirect effects may eventually be deleterious, if as a consequence of reducing the risk of infection among those susceptible, there is a displacement of the risk of infection to other age groups and/or to a more vulnerable population, as has been suggested for varicella or hepatitis A in certain scenarios.",
