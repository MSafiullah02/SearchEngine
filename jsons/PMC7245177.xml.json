The infected patients presented with pneumonia from an unknown cause, and by December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized these cases due to a potential virus. In March 2020, COVID-19 spread to 166 other countries with a declaration as a pandemic by WHO [1]. The coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a large family of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that infect both humans and animals, causing several respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and neurologic diseases [2]. The CoVs can be further divided into four major groups: alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus [3]. However, there were only six human COVs that have been identified, including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) [4]. The COVID-19 is the seventh human CoV to be identified, which has continued to spread globally.",

Infected patients < 50 years of age have a fatality risk of < 0.5%, while those > 70 years old have a fatality up to 8% [5]. However, current estimates put the cumulative fatality for COVID-19 at 5.6% (95% CI 5.4\u20135.8) for China and 15.2% (12.5\u201317.9) outside of China [6]. Globally, the fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be 5.7% (5.5\u20135.9) [6]. A recent study on the epidemiology of COVID-19 found that the daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 cases was greatest in China (1320.85 per day), followed by Republic of Korea (78.78 per day), Iran (43.11 per day), Italy (30.62 per day), Bahrain (9.5 per day), Kuwait (9 per day) and Japan (5.11 per day) [7]. Furthermore, the overall fatality rate of COVID-19 was highest in Eastern Mediterranean regions (6.7%, n = 34), followed by Asia (3.4%, n = 2861) and Europe (2.1%, n = 23%) [7]. However, these fatality data continue to changes as more cases appear in the USA and abroad.",

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is performed by the combination of history and physical examination, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) analysis and computerized tomography (CT) scan. However, the CT scans have been found to have the highest specificity for the diagnosis of COVID-19, although this may increase healthcare costs and reduces time to start treatment to individuals suspected of COVID-19 [8]. Currently, prevention of the transmission of COVID-19 remains at paramount importance. Therefore, the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) has recommended frequent hand washing, social distancing, avoiding crowds and avoidance of touching the mouth, nose and eyes to prevent the spread of COVID-19 until a vaccine or novel treatment is approved [9].",

Current evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus (or SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the beta-CoV group and shares 80% nucleotide identity at the genomic level with SARS-CoV [10]. Similar to other CoVs, COVID-19 is believed to have originated from bats and transferred to other intermediate hosts before being transmitted to humans [11]. In most cases, COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets [12]. Once an individual is infected with COVID-19, the most common symptoms are fever (98%), cough (76%), myalgia or fatigue (44%), and sometimes atypical symptoms such as sputum (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%) and diarrhea (3%) are present [2]. However, a patient can harbor a virus for a period of 2\u201314 days without any symptoms [2]. This is especially true with GI symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved [13]. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, etc.), screening these patients is essential. Therefore, pre-screening for COVID-19 should extend to asymptomatic individuals while keeping the GI manifestations in mind [9].",

Patients infected with the MERS-CoV show almost a similar frequency of GI symptoms (35%) as COVID-19 [22, 37, 38]. Specifically, the most common GI symptoms of MERS-CoV were diarrhea (22%) and vomiting (17%) [37]. Another study on MERS-CoV patients showed the presence of GI symptoms in almost 25% of patients; the study found diarrhea (26%), vomiting (21%) and abdominal pain (17%) being the most common GI symptoms [22].",

            "text": "Although no clinical studies have examined the release of the cytokine in the GI tract of COVID-19 patients. However, Th1 and Th2 cytokines cause hypocontractility and hypercontractility of inflamed intestinal smooth muscle through downregulating L-type Ca2+ channels and upregulating regulators of G protein-coupled receptors [41]. Furthermore, several cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-33, IL-36, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A all contribute to maintaining the integrity and function of the GI tract [42]. In COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm, elevations of IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were elevated [43]. Although these cases are rare, these cytokines may become elevated in mild or persistent COVID-19 cases [44]. For most COVID-19 patients, cytokines IL1-\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, FGF2, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1\u03b1, MIP1\u03b2, PDGFB, TNF\u03b1 and VEGFA were also elevated [44]. Some of these cytokines have been previously shown to be involved in GI health and disease [45\u201350]. For example, IL-2 is a potent cytokine that binds to lymphocytes and macrophages to maintain and preserve intersinal epithelium after injury from mechanical stresses, infections or viruses [45]. Similarly, IL-10 TNF\u03b1 are believed to maintain intestinal epithelium by termination of excess inflammatory responses after infections or cell death and survival mechanisms [49, 50]. The elevation of these cytokines suggest an increased protective response to COVID0-19 infection and damage to the GI tact. Further studies are needed to indemnity the cytokines elevated in COVID-19 patients and how it may influence the health of the GI and respiratory tract through chronic alterations in cytokine expression and secretion.",

Elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and aminotransferase levels have also been observed [5, 19, 51]. As it is a viral infection, patients usually have normal procalcitonin levels; however, higher procalcitonin levels have been seen in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) care [5, 19, 51]. The COVID-19 patients typically present with bilateral ground-glass opacification with or without consolidations are consistent with viral pneumonia on chest CT scans [52, 53]. Chest CT scans, together with rt-PCR testing, have a high sensitivity of 97% for detecting COVID-19 but at the expense of specificity being only 25% [54]. In patients with GI symptoms, the best test of COVID-19 diagnosis appears to be the collection and analysis of stool samples [13, 14, 17]. Given the susceptibility of the GI tract to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is also recommended to measure aminotransferase levels to evaluate the severity of the infection [9]. However, more studies of COVID-19 are needed to establish rigorous and reliable markers for evaluating GI injury.",

Each of these agents was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in preliminary in vivo and in vitro studies; however, further human clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of these agents [69, 70].

Furthermore, given the potential risk of spread of the COVID-19 via fecal\u2013oral transmission, all major American gastroenterological societies including American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) have made recommendations for managing COVID-19 in the patients both in outpatient and endoscopy settings [9, 71]. They divided those procedures into \u201cnon-urgent/postpone\u201d and \u201cnon-urgent/perform\u201d depending on the need for the endoscopy. It has been strongly advised to reschedule non-urgent endoscopic procedures such as cancer evaluations, prosthetic removals and evaluation of significant symptoms [9, 71]. Furthermore, physicians are encouraged to screen patients using telemedicine for non-emergent procedures to decrease office visits for at-risk or infected patients and provide needed care to patients who are less willing or unable to travel. Besides, telemedicine between patients allows effective triage the urgent and non-urgent procedures, thereby reducing a patient\u2019s risk of being exposed to COVID-19. Deferral of the elective procedures is likely to decrease the risk of transmission of COVID-19 as luminal contents are frequently encountered during upper and lower endoscopies. Second, all personnel involved with endoscopic procedures should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, mask, eye shield/goggles, face shields and gown) [9]. These protocols and PPE are strongly encouraged by the CDC and WHO [9]. With a shortage of medical supplies, it is also recommended that physicians extend the use or reuse of surgical masks and eye protection; however, reusing medical equipment may inadvertently increase COVID-19 transmission or exposure [9]. Further investigation is needed to determine proper protective equipment protocols for COVID-19 infections.",

Particular emphasis should be given to check the body temperature of patients arriving at the endoscopy center and avoid bringing patients older than 65 years to medical facilities unless necessary [9]. Furthermore, endoscopy units should inform patients at least 24 h before any procedure to discuss their risks of COVID-19, risks of endoscopy in viral transmission and appropriate intervention, including the postponement of the procedure.",

The biosafety level should be increased to level 3 (includes laboratories or medical facilities that work with microbes of either indigenous or exotic that cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation) for COVID-19 patients [72]. As described by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), the different biosafety levels minimize the transmission of COVID-19 and delay or \u201cflatten\u201d the outbreak curve of the infection, which prevents overwhelming the healthcare resources [73]. Therefore, the BSG recommends that endoscopic procedures only be performed in patients with acute upper GI bleeding, acute esophageal obstruction, endoscopic vacuum therapy for perforations/leaks, acute cholangitis/jaundice secondary to malignant/benign biliary obstruction, acute biliary pancreatitis, and/or cholangitis with stone and jaundice, infected pancreatic collections, urgent inpatient nutrition support and GI obstruction needing urgent decompression/stenting [73]. It is particularly important since these patients tend to have weaker immune systems and have a higher risk of infection [73].",

As more information is being gathered, understanding of the virus will most likely improve with better diagnosis, prevention and treatment options for patients exposed or experiencing symptoms from the disease. However, the GI manifestations of COVID-19 pose a continuing challenge for the prevention of the virus spread. Physicians should monitor for GI symptoms in COVID-19-infected patients and examine whether the virus continues to remain in their stools after their respiratory symptoms have resolved. This knowledge may provide greater insight into preventing further infections and long-term complications arising from the COVID-19 and might help in policy-making to prevent the community from the virus spread.",
