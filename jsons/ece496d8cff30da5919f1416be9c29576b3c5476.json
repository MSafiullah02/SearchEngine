Particularly, CXCL17 is produced along the epithelium of the airways both at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. While increased CXCL17 expression is associated with disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung/hepatic cancer, it is thought to play a protective role in pancreatic cancer, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral infections. Thus, there is emerging evidence pointing to both a harmful and protective role for CXCL17 in human health and disease, with therapeutic potential for translational applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery, characteristics and functions of CXCL17 emphasizing its clinical potential in respiratory disorders.",

            "text": "The respiratory tract plays a vital role in respiratory physiology by enabling gas exchange at the alveolar/capillary membrane. As such, the airways are in continuous contact with the airborne particulate matter, and the respiratory epithelium is colonized by several species of virus, bacteria, and fungi [1] . Nonetheless, infection and disease progression is prevented by the innate pulmonary defense mechanisms [1] . While the continuous functioning of the immune system is necessary to maintain respiratory barrier integrity against microbes, it is also regulated to prevent excessive tissue damage and inflammation. Several cytokines and chemokines shape the magnitude and quality of immune responses occurring at the lungs [2] . Specifically, chemokines regulate the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cellular composition of mucosal tissue by inducing the migration of leukocytes and other nonimmune cells expressing their cognate receptors [3] . Twenty three chemokine receptor subsets have been identified in humans and are broadly classified into atypical chemokine receptors (n=4) or the G protein-coupled chemotactic chemokine receptors (n = 19) [4, 5] . Although certain chemokine-receptor pairs are highly specific and unique (such as CXCR6/CXCL16), often several chemokine/receptor pairs can be formed, each one with variable specificity depending on the cellular targets induced to migrate [3] . Depending on the differential receptor expression and usage, as well as the potential agonism or antagonism initiated by the chemokine-receptor binding, the functions observed in vivo for chemokines acting at the same G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) might vary [6] . The binding of chemokines to their receptors triggers a chain of molecular events including the dissociation of GTP-bound G\u03b1i subunits from G\u03b2/\u03b3 heterodimers, which initiates calcium release from the endoplasmic-reticulum reservoirs and further activation of calciumdependent signaling. These events lead to the downstream initiation of JAK/STAT, mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways which eventually govern the functional responses induced by these chemokines [7, 8] .",

CXCL17 is produced along the airways both at steady state and induced under inflammatory conditions [19, 20] , suggesting a role in local J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f immune responses at the respiratory system. Current attempts to characterize the biology of CXCL17 have revealed its involvement in maintenance of homeostasis and cellular composition at different epithelial surfaces. Moreover, recent studies show that CXCL17 is involved in several human health and disease playing either a protective or pathologic role, respectively. Thus, in this review we provide an overview of the discovery, characteristics and functions of CXCL17, specifically discussing its translational potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic agent in pulmonary medicine.",

Post-translational cleavage removes a 22 amino acids sequence containing two cysteine residues from the amino-terminal domain, which result in a mature protein of 11, 418Da J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in humans and 11,164Da in mice [19 , 20 , 23] .

Despite this, it is now established that CXCL17-induced cell migration is inhibited by Pertussis toxin (PTX) which reduces the affinity of GPR35 for its agonist via ADP ribosylation of G\u03b1i/o heterotrimeric proteins and resultant uncoupling of the GPCR from the G proteins [22, 29, 30] . Furthermore, there is evidence showing that intracellular signals triggered by the attachment of CXCL17 to its receptor involves the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPKs pathways [23] . Therefore, most published studies support the fact that CXCL17 receptor is a GPCR with seven transmembrane domains such as GPR35. and is expressed in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. CXCL17 expression in healthy human tissues and cell lines showed its basal production in fetal lung samples, as well as in adult trachea, epithelium of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar cells [19, 20] . Also, its expression is detected in the stomach, small intestine and colon, specifically within the lining epithelium at the luminal surface of epithelial cells, suggesting an active process of secretion of this chemokine into the airways and intestinal lumen, respectively [19, 24] . Interestingly, the distribution of CXCL17 is almost restricted to the epithelial barriers that cover the lumen of several hollow organs and secretory conducts, in contrast with other mucosal chemokines, such as CXCL14 and CCL25, which can also be found within the solid parenchyma of different tissues at steady state [31] [32] [33] .",

Indeed, CXCL17 -/mice exhibit a slight decrease in the number of alveolar macrophages but have normal number of lung interstitial macrophages, with no differences in cellular subsets in other tissues [36] . Other cells may amplify CXCL17 signaling from the epithelium, such as endothelial cells which are also producers of CXCL17 [24] , suggesting that this chemokine facilitates the exit of APCs from the vasculature. Indeed, pretreatment of monocytes and DCs with CXC17 enhances their ability to attach to the intracellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM2, also known as CD102), an integrin binding protein relevant for leukocyte traffic across endothelium [29] .",

In fact, several human endothelial cell lines such as human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC), sephranose vascular endothelial cells (SPVEC) and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) express higher levels of CXCL17 during proliferation or tube formation [20] . HUVEC cells transfected with CXCL17 increase their expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiopoietin-2 (ang-2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and uPA receptor (uPAR) [20] . Also, treatment of THP-1 monocytes with mature CXCL17 enhances their ability to produce VEGF-A [23] . Additionally, expression of CXCL17 is co-regulated with other proangiogenic molecules as IL-8, GRO-1 and VEGF in samples from lung, breast and esophageal cancers [20] .

Currently there is a concise body of evidence suggesting that CXCL17 is an anti-inflammatory mediator in conditions such as experimental psoriasis in mice, autoimmune diseases and respiratory afflictions in humans [35, 45, 46] . Indeed, in mice with experimental psoriasis, the local administration of CXCL17 has been related to a reduced infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the skin, reduced T cell responses as well as lower local levels of IL-17A, IL-22, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IL-23, but increased expression of IL-10 and Foxp3 [45] . These changes are also associated with recruitment of myeloid-derived stem cells (MDSCs) to the sites of CXCL17 exposure, which subsequently attract T regulatory (Treg) cells in a CCL4-and CCL5-dependent way [45] . Moreover, in vitro assays have shown that the CXCL17 treatment also attenuates the LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages [23] . Finally, the genetic knockdown of CXCL17 in mice has been recently associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmunity in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), suggesting that deficiencies in CXCL17 signaling are important for the development and maintenance of auto-tolerance [35] . Collectively, these data strengthen the notion that CXCL17 has a potent anti-inflammatory role in autoimmune diseases.",

In this context, the role of CXCL17 in the immunity to infection remains under investigation. Recently, it was observed that expression of CXCL17 was highly increased in the duodenum of humans with acute cholera, but the nature of its contribution to the defense against Vibrio cholerae was undetermined [56] . Likewise, in a mouse model of HSV-1 infection, the inoculation of the virus enhanced CXCL17 production at the vaginal mucosa of mice [44] . Concurrently, mice deficient in CXCL17 were more susceptible to HSV-1, as they could not control viral replication nor virus dissemination to the dorsal ganglia.",

This hypothesis is partially supported by observations about increased expression of CXCL17 and GPR35 in breast cancer clinical samples [61] .

Formation of new blood vessels within tumors is a pivotal event that supports nutrient supply, cancer progression and better access to blood vessels enabling cancer cells to metastasize [70] . CXCL17 is coregulated with VEGF in clinical samples from individuals with cancer [20] . Secondly, fibroblast cell lines and colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1, SW620) expressing CXCL17 form tumors with increased vasculature and abundant blood supply when injected into immunodeficient mice [22] . Some of these tumors were characterized by the infiltration of CD11b + Gr-1 + cells that migrate in response to CXCL17 gradients and participate in the promotion of tumor formation and vascularization [22] . Therefore, these data suggest that CXCL17 may promote tumor Finally, CXCL17 may also modify the immune microenvironment of tumors. For instance, in tissue samples from humans with HCC and colon cancer, a high expression of CXCL17 was associated with the presence of CD68 + cells, the proportion of which correlates with survival [ 60 , 62 ] . Also, CXCL17 is a known recruiter of MDSC and Treg cells [45] , and it is already established that MDSC can synergize with Treg cells to prevent tumor immunity and promote tumor progression [71] . In contrast there is currently insufficient evidence to support a role for CXCL17mediated anti-tumoral immune responses. Interestingly, CXCL17 mediate the infiltration of immature myeloid DCs into pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous carcinomas and promotes rendering of the tumor susceptible to cytotoxic T cell mediated cytolysis [29] . Also, expression of CXCL17 is lost progressively as pancreatic tumors become more malignant [29] , supporting a protective effect during early stages of pancreatic cancer development. However, whether such an anti-tumor role for CXCL17 would extend to other cancer subtypes would be a necessary avenue for future research.",

            "text": "Recently, the participation of CXCL17 in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation responsible of type 2 asthma has been established by assessing the expression of CXCL17 in bronchial brushing samples from asthmatic patients, who showed higher transcripts of this chemokine compared to healthy controls [46] . Such increased expression was restricted to the bronchial epithelium. Furthermore, the mechanism was evaluated in vitro in a bronchial cell line, wherein overexpression of CXCL17 gene inhibited the production of CCL24, CCL26 and epithelial periostin (POSTN; all molecules involved in recruitment of eosinophils) in response to exogenous stimulation with IL-13. Also, an inverse correlation between CXCL17 transcript levels and miR-221 was observed while overregulation of miR-221 increased production of CCL24, CCL26, POSTN, as well as lung eosinophilic inflammation by suppressing CXCL17 expression [46] . This suggests an anti-inflammatory role of CXCL17 in asthma, as CCL26 and CCL24 are key players in eosinophilic recruitment, proliferation and airway remodeling in asthma [84, 85] , while miR-221 participates in airway epithelial cell injury via sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) [86] . Thus, the enhanced production of CXCL17 at respiratory epithelium in asthmatic individuals might reflect a compensatory effort to counteract inflammation of the airways which makes this chemokine a potential target for immunotherapeutic development. Nonetheless, it is also possible that CXCL17 mediates contrasting roles during different stages of asthma, but this notion should be evaluated in future investigations. Additionally, this feature of increased CXCL17 in asthmatic individuals makes it a potential diagnostic biomarker, but targeted studies validating this are yet to be conducted. Finally, findings described here should prompt clinical researchers to look for a potential role of CXCL17 in other allergic respiratory diseases such as rhinitis, as well as in pulmonary disorders caused by altered infiltration of eosinophils, as is the case of eosinophilic interstitial lung disease.",

For this, studies comparing the concentration of CXCL17 between biological samples (BAL, bronchial brushing, sputum, biopsy specimens, plasma) from humans with lung cancer and healthy controls would be needed. Next, investigations looking for correlation between levels of this chemokine and clinical parameters such as risk of mortality, recurrence after treatment and incidence of metastasis, will reveal the pro-or antitumorigenic features of CXCL17 activity in the context of lung cancer. Furthermore, animal models using knockout mice, as well as genetic manipulation of CXCL17 expression in lung cancer cell lines will reveal the underlying mechanisms including promotion of cellular proliferation, escape from apoptosis, metastasis, regulation of anti-tumoral immune responses, and support of angiogenesis. This latter mechanism may deserve particular consideration since angiogenic pathways play a remarkable role in the promotion of tumor growth in NSCLC [94] .",

Interestingly, patients with higher levels of CXCL17 exhibited a trend for decreased disease severity and better survival indicating an enhanced host response to thwart progressing infection. However, further studies deconvoluting the role of CXCL17 and influenza would be needed to fully ascertain this link (Dr. Joaquin Zuniga, unpublished data). While there is a paucity of published studies assessing the expression of CXCL17 in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV), the Influenza Research Database provides a wealth of curated data from ongoing research on the immune responses induced in response to this deadly virus. One such study assessed the significantly altered genes induced in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f vitro in Calu-3 (2B-4) human lung epithelial cells infected with the virulent wild-type icSARS-COV or the attenuated mutant strains, icSARSExoNI [mutation in exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) governing the activity of guanine-N7methyltransferase involved in infection and pathogenesis)] and icSARS dNSP16 (mutations in a 12 conserved 2'O methyltransferase which impacts immune responses and pathogenesis)",

He received his MS degree in 2017 at the National School of Biological Sciences, National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (ENCB, IPN). Then, he spent a year in Dr.Khader's lab at the Department of Molecular Microbiology at the Washington University in St. Louis, MO, where he focused his research on the role of specific chemokines (including CXCL17) to the immune responses against tuberculosis. Jos\u00e9 Alberto Chore\u00f1o-Parra has moved to the INER in Mexico City, where he is conducting clinical studies in patients with tuberculosis and influenza to obtain his PhD degree. Shyamala Thirunavukkarasu received her PhD from the University of Sydney focusing on the role of pathogen and host associated lipids in the macrophage immune responses to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infection. She completed her postdoctoral training at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center working on the gender specific role of cytochrome P450 1B1 mediated effects on steroid metabolism alterations in cardiovascular and renal diseases. She then completed a senior postdoctoral research fellowship at the Idaho Veterans Research and Education Foundation on the cell cycle/cell death programming in myoblasts in response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration during group A streptococcal infections. Her research interests involve identifying the mechanisms that contribute to host immune response to infections and metabolic diseases & disorders. She is currently a Staff Scientist at Dr. Shabaana Khader's lab at the Department of Molecular Microbiology at the Washington University in St. Louis, MO, where her research involves the identification of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f common inter-species immune correlates of inflammation and risk of TB and utilizing animal models to determine the function of genes identified as correlates of risk of disease in humans. Joaqu\u00edn Z\u00fa\u00f1iga received his PhD from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and then moved to Dr. Edmond Yunis' lab at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA, where he carried out his Post-doctoral training. Dr. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga then joined the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) in Mexico City, where he has conducted clinical research studies in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and influenza virus infection. Dr. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga participated in the initial description of the first cases of severe pneumonia caused by the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, which emerged in Mexico in 2009. Since then, Dr. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's research has focused on the study of protective immunity against this virus, as well as on the epigenetic control of immune responses occurring at the lung. Since 2017, Dr. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga is the head of the Research Department of the INER. Shabaana Khader received her PhD in Biotechnology from Madurai Kamaraj University, India where she studied host-pathogen interactions during the mycobacterial disease, leprosy. Dr. Khader then carried out her Post-doctoral training at the Trudeau Institute, NY, where she continued studying host immune responses to another globally relevant mycobacterial disease, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tuberculosis. During her stay at the Trudeau Institute, Dr. Khader demonstrated a critical role for the cytokine Interleukin-17 in vaccine-induced immunity to tuberculosis, as well as described seminal roles for IL-12 cytokines in tuberculosis. Dr. Khader then joined the University of Pittsburgh in 2007 as Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics where her lab continued to study the role of cytokines in immunity to intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis. In 2013, Dr. Khader and her research team moved to the Department of Molecular Microbiology at the Washington University in St. Louis, where she is now a tenured Professor, in the Department of Molecular Microbiology. Her lab is focused on the immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis including aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity as well as vaccine-induced immunity to tuberculosis.",

(a) CXCL17 expression is restricted to the lining epithelium of the airways and distant alveoli. (b) CXCL17 has a potent bactericidal activity over pathogenic bacterial strains, but not against commensal bacteria, suggesting a role in shaping the composition of bacterial community residing at different epithelial surfaces. In addition, CXCL17 controls the recruitment of certain subsets of myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages across the endothelium into the epithelium. (c) During mucosal infections, production of CXCL17 may increase to counteract bacterial replication by its direct antimicrobial activity, or via regulating the infiltration of myeloid cells into the infected epithelium. (d) CXCL17 also plays an anti-inflammatory role, as illustrated in the case of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 43 eosinophilic inflammation of the airways elicited by allergens in patients with type 2 asthma. In these settings, CXCL17 inhibits the production of chemokines important for the recruitment of eosinophils, such as CCL24 and CCL26.
