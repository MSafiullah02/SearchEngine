Chemokines are expressed within the CNS early following MHV infection and are important in host defense by attracting activated lymphocytes bearing the appropriate chemokine receptor which then participate in reduction in viral burden via secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and cytolytic activity (Chen et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2001a; Parra et al., 1999, Parra et al., 2000). However, viral RNA/antigen often persists and surviving mice will develop an immune-mediated demyelinating disease with similar clinical and histologic characteristics to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997, Marten et al., 2001, Templeton and Perlman, 2007, Weiner, 1973). Secretion of chemokines during chronic disease amplifies the severity of demyelination in MHV-infected mice by recruiting activated T cells and macrophages into the CNS that participate in myelin destruction (Glass et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2001b).",

            "text": "Early following MHV infection, the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10, also known as IP-10) is expressed primarily by ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia (Lane et al., 1998). CXCL10 aids in defense during acute disease by attracting antigen-specific T cells expressing the receptor CXCR3. Indeed, use of blocking antibodies specific for either CXCL10, CXCR3, or infection of CXCL10 deficient mice results in impaired T cell trafficking into the CNS of MHV-infected mice and delayed viral clearance (Dufour et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2000, Stiles et al., 2006). Moreover, CXCL10 expression is also important in enhancing innate immune responses by attracting NK cells into the CNS which aid in defense through the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 (Trifilo et al., 2004). CXCL9 (also known as MIG, monokine induced by interferon gamma) is a CXC chemokine that is closely related to CXCL10 with regards to both structure and function (Farber, 1997). Similar to CXCL10, CXCL9 is expressed by a wide variety of cell types following exposure to cytokines including IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Farber, 1997, Ho and Ivashkiv, 2006). In addition, CXCL9 expression is correlated with host defense following infection of mice with poxvirus (Mahalingam et al., 1999, Mahalingam et al., 2000), murine cytomegalovirus (Hokeness et al., 2007, Salazar-Mather et al., 2000), adenovirus (Arai et al., 2002) and transgenic mice capable of replicating hepatitis B virus (Kakimi et al., 2001a, Kakimi et al., 2001b) by attracting CXCR3-expressing T cells and NK cells to sites of viral infection and replication. With regards to MHV infection, blocking CXCL9 function by administering anti-CXCL9 antibodies to infected mice resulted in increased mortality and enhanced recovery of virus from the brain that correlated with reduced T cell infiltration (Liu et al., 2001). Together, these findings emphasize an important role for both CXCL9 and CXCL10 in orchestrating the recruitment of targeted CXCR3+lymphocytes into the CNS in response to MHV infection that aid in host defense by reducing viral burden.",

In addition, the ability of mice deficient in CXCL9 (CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice) to generate an effective host response in response to MHV infection was determined. To accomplish these goals, we infected mice in which CXCL9 expression was genetically silenced (CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice) with a recombinant MHV that expresses CXCL9 (MHV-CXCL9) from a dispensable open reading frame within the viral genome and infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 and CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice to evaluate how CXCL9 contributes to anti-viral defenses following MHV infection of the brain and liver.",

As shown in Fig. 1A, infection of wild type mice with MHV-A59 resulted in \u223c 40% survival by day 12 p.i. In contrast, MHV-A59 infection of CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in increased susceptibility with 100% of mice dead by day 5 p.i. (Fig. 1A). Similarly, RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with virus also exhibited increased susceptibility with 100% of mice dying by day 8 (Fig. 1A). Comparison of viral titers within the brains and livers of infected mice revealed similar titers at days 1 and 3 p.i. (Fig. 1B). Although there were increased viral titers within the brains, but not livers, of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 at day 5 p.i. compared to wild type mice, this difference was not significant (Fig. 1B). CXCL9 protein was detected within the brains and livers of infected wild type mice and RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice at days 1 and 3 p.i. with greater levels present in wild type mice at both times points (Fig. 1C). No CXCL9 protein was detected within tissues of infected CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate the importance of CXCL9 in host defense following MHV infection of the brain and liver. Presumably, this is the result of deficient recruitment of cells expressing the CXCL9 receptor CXCR3 e.g. T cells and NK cells into infected tissues that aid in control of viral replication. Moreover, these data highlight the importance of an adaptive immune response in controlling MHV replication, particularly within the brain, as RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice also exhibited increased mortality compared to immunocompetent wild type mice.",

            "text": "In order to assess the functional contributions of CXCL9 in host defense following MHV infection, we constructed a recombinant of MHV capable of expressing CXCL9 with the goal of instilling this virus into the CNS of either RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice or CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice and evaluating disease severity. We inserted the exogenous CXCL9 gene into a functional transcription unit in the genome of MHV-A59 in place of most of gene 4. MHV gene 4 encodes a nonstructural protein that is not essential for replication either in tissue culture or in the mouse host (Ontiveros et al., 2001, Weiss et al., 1993, Yokomori and Lai, 1991). This has been most clearly shown in the JHM strain of MHV, where targeted disruption of both transcription and translation of gene 4 was demonstrated to have no detectable effect on growth in tissue culture or virulence in the mouse CNS (Ontiveros et al., 2001). Moreover, in MHV-A59 the expression of gene 4 is abrogated by a frameshift mutation that truncates the protein after 19 codons (Weiss et al., 1993). The CXCL9-expressing recombinant of MHV was generated by targeted RNA recombination, a reverse genetic system that has been used to manipulate the 31-kb RNA genome of MHV (Koetzner et al., 1992, Masters et al., 1994). To construct recombinants, the CXCL9 ORF was first introduced into plasmid pMH54 (pMH54-CXCL9) downstream of the gene 4 transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) and replacing the first two-thirds of gene 4 (Fig. 2A). As a control, a separate pMH54 vector was generated that contained an inverted CXCL9 ORF (pMH54-cCXCL9) with several engineered stop codons to ensure that generation of a polypeptide was inhibited (Fig. 2A). Viral recombinants were generated through RNA-RNA recombination between either pCXCL9A or pCXCL9B-derived synthetic transcripts and the genome of the N gene deletion mutant Alb4 (Fig. 2B), which was selected against on the basis of its thermolability (Koetzner et al., 1992, Masters et al., 1994). Independent, plaque-purified recombinant candidates were characterized by RT-PCR analysis of viral RNA, and the integrity of the CXCL9 ORF or the control CXCL9 (cCXCL9) were ascertained by direct sequencing of purified PCR products. One CXCL9 recombinant virus (MHV-CXCL9) and a control CXCL9 (MHV-cCXCL9) were chosen for subsequent experiments in mice. Both MHV-CXCL9 and MHV-cCXCL9 formed plaques of indistinguishable size and morphology in tissue culture, and both viruses grew to high titers, producing comparable amounts of syncytia and cytopathic effect in infected cells. To directly compare the two recombinants, we separately infected monolayers with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 and determined the infectious titer of virus released at various times from 2 to 48 h p.i. This revealed that the growth kinetics of the CXCL9 recombinant and the control counterpart were indistinguishable (Fig. 2C). To ascertain whether CXCL9 was capable of being secreted by the engineered recombinant virus, supernatants from mock-infected cells or from cells infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 were analyzed by ELISA. The results shown in Fig. 2D reveal increased expression of CXCL9 protein at 12 and 24 h from MHV-CXCL9-infected cultures. No CXCL9 was detected within supernatants of cultures following infection with MHV-cCXCL9 (sensitivity of assay < 10 pg/mL).",

As shown in Fig. 3A, RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 resulted in death as early as 5 days p.i. and 100% mortality by day 9 p.i. In contrast, MHV-CXCL9-infected mice displayed 100% survival up to 14 days p.i. following infection and \u223c 20% of mice survived until 20 days p.i. Correlating with the increased mortality in mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9, there was a significant increase (p\n \u2264 0.05) in viral titers within the brains at days 3, 5, and 7 p.i. as compared to MHV-CXCL9-infected mice (Fig. 3B). In addition, viral titers were reduced within the livers of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice compared to MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice at days 3, 5, and 7 p.i. (Fig. 3C). The enhanced ability to control viral replication within both the brain and livers of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice was not the result of increased IFN-\u03b3 secretion as there were no differences in IFN-\u03b3 protein levels within the brains as determined by ELISA nor increased expression of MHC class II staining on microglia (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining supported titer data from brains and livers demonstrating that diminished survival was associated with increased viral antigen within the brain (Fig. 4A) and liver (Fig. 4B) of mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 as compared to tissues isolated from MHV-CXCL9-infected (Figs. 4C, D). Within the CNS, there were no differences in cellular tropism as viral antigen was detected within glial cells present in mice infected with MHV-CXCL9 (Fig. 4E) and MHV-cCXCL9 (Fig. 4F). Histologic examination of the livers at day 7 p.i. revealed that RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 contained numerous lesions characteristic of MHV-induced hepatitis characterized by large confluent areas of hepatocyte necrosis with varying degrees of anisonuleosis and multinucleation as well as apoptosis (Fig. 4H). In general, livers from RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-CXCL9 exhibited fewer and, in general, smaller lesions and less hepatic damage and reactive nucleomegaly (Fig. 4G).",

To determine if the decrease in mortality and viral burden reflected differences in the profile of NK cell infiltration, flow cytometric analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from the brains and livers of mice infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 was performed. The results shown in Fig. 5A reveal similar levels of NK cells infiltrating into the brains of mice infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 at all time points examined indicating that viral-derived CXCL9 did not enhance accumulation of NK cells. NK cell infiltration was increased (p\n \u2264 0.05) within livers of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice compared to MHV-cCXCL9 at day 3 p.i. and levels remained elevated by day 5 p.i., although this difference was not significant (Fig. 5A). To further evaluate whether NK cells contributed to host defense, NK cells were depleted from MHV-CXCL9-infected mice through treatment with anti-asialo GM1 antisera (Trifilo et al., 2004) that resulted in a significant reduction (p\n \u2264 0.001) in NK cells present in both brain and liver (Fig. 5B). The absence of NK cells within the livers, but not the brain, resulted in a significant (p\n \u2264 0.01) increase in viral titers supporting earlier studies indicating that NK cells are important in controlling viral replication in within the livers of MHV-infected mice (Fig. 5C) (Walsh et al., 2007).",

As shown in Fig. 6A, infection of wild type mice with MHV-cCXCL9 resulted in \u223c 80% survival of mice out to day 21 p.i. while 100% of mice infected with MHV-CXCL9 survived the infection. Correspondingly, enhanced survival in MHV-CXCL9-infected mice was associated with accelerated reduction in viral burden within both brain and liver compared to MHV-cCXCL9-infected animals (Fig. 6B). CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice (Park et al., 2002) were infected with MHV-CXCL9 to determine if CXCL9 derived from the viral genome resulted in protection from disease. As shown in Fig. 7A, i.c. inoculation with MHV-CXCL9 resulted in 100% survival out to day 21 p.i. while infection with MHV-cCXCL9 resulted in \u223c 65% survival. Correlating with survival in MHV-CXCL9-infected mice was a pronounced ability to control viral replication that coincided with accelerated reduction in viral burden within both the brain and liver when compared to mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9. Within the brains of mice infected with MHV-CXCL9, there was a significant (p\n \u2264 0.005) reduction in viral titers at days 3, 5, and 7 p.i. compared to MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice (Fig. 7B). Similarly, viral titers were significantly (p\n \u2264 0.005) reduced within the livers of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice compared to MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice at days 3 and 5 p.i. (Fig. 7B). However, it is important to emphasize that by day 12 p.i. surviving CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 were ultimately able to reduce viral titers within both the brain and livers to levels comparable with mice infected with MHV-CXCL9 (Fig. 7B). Assessment of immune cell infiltration within infected tissues revealed increased (p\n \u2264 0.005) levels of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in the brains of MHV-CXCL9-infected CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice at days 3 and 7 p.i. compared to MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice yet similar numbers of T cell susbsets were present by day 12 p.i. in mice infected with either virus (Fig. 8A). Determination of T cell numbers within the livers revealed no differences in levels of infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 at days 3, 7, and 12 p.i. (Fig. 8B). Infiltration of NK cells into the brains was reduced (p\n \u2264 0.05) in mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 compared to MHV-CXCL9-infected mice while there were no differences in NK cell infiltration within the livers of mice infected with either virus at any time point examined (Fig. 8C).",

Immunostaining for MHV in the brains of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice supported the titer data with far fewer cells staining positive for viral antigen (Fig. 9D) when compared to the brains of MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice which had extensive staining for virus (Fig. 9B). Examination of the spinal cords of surviving mice indicated overall similar severity of white matter damage in mice infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 (data not shown). Livers from mice infected with MHV-CXCL9 at day 5 p.i. exhibited small and scattered foci of periportal inflammation consisting mostly of lymphocytes and vascular congestion (Fig. 10D). In contrast, MHV-cCXCL9 infection resulted in a more pronounced and severe hepatitis with portal tracts destroyed by a combination of necrotic hepatocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (Fig. 10A). In correlation with the viral titer data, there was decreased viral antigen detected in the livers of CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-CXCL9 (Figs. 10E, F) compared to MHV-cCXCL9 (Figs. 10B, C) infection. In both experimental groups, viral antigen was present in hepatocytes encircling areas of focally necrotic regions although this was dramatically reduced within MHV-CXCL9-infected mice. In addition, MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice exhibited significantly increased (p\n \u2264 0.01) levels of serum alanine transferase (sALT) within the blood compared to MHV-CXCL9-infected mice, further supporting increased liver disease in MHV-cCXCL9-infected mice (Fig. 10G).",

            "text": "This study utilized a reverse genetics approach to insert the chemokine CXCL9 coding sequence into the genome of MHV in order to characterize how CXCL9 may influence host defense and/or disease in response to MHV infection. The results presented support and extend earlier studies demonstrating a role for CXCL9 in host defense in response to MHV infection (Liu et al., 2001). In these experiments, administration of blocking antibodies specific for CXCL9 to mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of MHV (JHMV), resulted in increased mortality that correlated with diminished T cell infiltration into the CNS and correspondingly higher viral titers. The present study demonstrated that infection of mice in which CXCL9 is genetically silenced with the A59 strain of MHV, which is capable of replicating in both brain and liver, results in rapid mortality presumably due to inability to sufficiently control viral replication in target organs. CXCL9 is expressed in both brain and liver early following MHV-A9 infection of both C57BL/6 and RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice emphasizing that this chemokine is rapidly secreted in response to infection. However, infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a similar mortality curve as infected CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice and these findings demonstrate the importance of infiltrating leukocytes in controlling MHV replication within these tissues. Our findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for CXCL9 in enhancing innate immune responses as MHV-CXCL9 infection of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in prolonged survival that correlated with reduced viral titers in both brain and liver when compared to RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9. Increased NK cell infiltration into the liver, but not the brain, was observed in MHV-CXCL9-infected mice compared to mice infected with the control MHV-cCXCL9 virus. Furthermore, depletion of NK cells from MHV-CXCL9-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in increased viral titers within the livers, but not the brains, indicating that NK cells contribute in controlling MHV replication within the liver but are dispensable in host defense within the CNS. These findings support earlier studies demonstrating an important role for NK cells in controlling MHV replication within the liver (Walsh et al., 2007, Walsh et al., 2008). These findings are also of interest as we have previously determined that i.c. infection of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice with a recombinant MHV expressing CXCL10 (MHV-CXCL10) resulted in increased survival accompanied by reduced viral titers that correlated with elevated NK cell infiltration into the CNS and IFN-\u03b3 expression (Trifilo et al., 2004). Depletion of NK cells in MHV-CXCL10-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in increased viral burden in the brain indicating that increased expression of CXCL10 within the CNS mice lacking a functional adaptive immune response conferred protection via attraction of NK cells (Trifilo et al., 2004). These findings are also supported by earlier studies by Mahalingam and colleagues (Mahalingam et al., 1999) in which infection of athymic nude mice with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either CXCL9 or CXCL10 resulted in protection from disease that was mediated by IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells. In contrast, the data presented in this study highlights functional differences with regards to CXCL9 expression and host defense within the CNS of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with MHV with regards to NK cells. Although MHV-CXCL9-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited increased survival that correlated with a reduction in viral titers within the brains, protection from CNS disease was not associated with increased NK cell infiltration or IFN-\u03b3 production and depletion of NK cells did not result in increased viral titers. Therefore, these findings argue that protection mediated by inclusion of CXCL9 into the MHV genome is separate from either attracting and/or activating NK cells and suggest alternative mechanisms to control viral replication. Whether viral-derived CXCL9 increases local type I IFN expression within the CNS that is capable of dampening MHV replication (Ireland et al., 2008) or mutes MHV receptor expression by susceptible cells which limits the spread of virus remains to be determined. Alternatively, it may also be possible that increased levels of CXCL9 may inhibit viral binding to target cells through binding to heparin sulfate on the cell surface as Chen and colleagues (Chen et al., 2006) have recently reported that CXCL10 interaction with heparin sulfate inhibits Dengue virus from binding target cells.",

            "text": "Infection of C57BL/6 mice with MHV-CXCL9 resulted in increased protection from disease that correlated with accelerated clearance of virus from both brain and liver when compared to mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 and this most likely correlates with increased T cell infiltration into target tissues in response to elevated CXCL9 production from the virus. However, surviving mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9 were eventually able to clear virus below levels of detection. In order to more accurately define mechanisms associated with CXCL9-mediated protection, CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with the recombinant viruses. Infection with MHV-CXCL9 resulted in increased survival associated with increased infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the CNS and a corresponding decrease in viral burden. These findings are consistent with earlier studies from our laboratory indicating that antibody targeting of CXCL9 following MHV infection of the CNS resulted in increased mortality as a result of decreased T cell accumulation within the CNS indicating CXCL9 can function in host defense by attracting T cells into the CNS in response to MHV infection (Liu et al., 2001). Correspondingly, increased mortality accompanied by reduced T cell infiltration into the CNS was observed in CXCL9 deficient mice infected with MHV-cCXCL9. However, it is important to emphasize that MHV-cCXCL9 infection of CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice did not result in 100% mortality while infection with wild type MHV-A59 did kill 100% of mice. At this time, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this difference are not defined as infection of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 with MHV-cCXCL9 resulted in a similar mortality curve as MHV-A59. This difference may relate to potentially reduced rate of spread/replication of MHV-cCXCL9 within infected tissues compared to MHV-A59. Nevertheless, we believe this doesn't diminish the strengths of the model system employed nor detract from the importance of CXCL9 in host defense following MHV infection. With regards to MHV-cCXCL9 infection of C57BL/6 and CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice, increased survival supports the possibility that other chemokines, notably CXCL10 and CCL5, are likely to compensate and aid in attracting virus-specific T cells into the CNS (Glass et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2001b). We do not believe that the absence of CXCL9 impairs the generation of virus-specific T cells following MHV infection as similar numbers of T cells specific for MHV are generated in either CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 or CXCL9+/+ mice in response to MHV infection (data not shown). Moreover, there were no detectable differences in the ability of leukocytes to exit the microvasculature and enter the parenchyma in CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 indicating that the absence of CXCL9 did not affects positional migration of cells following migration to the CNS. Therefore, we conclude that viral-derived CXCL9 aids in protection from MHV-induced encephalitis by attracting CXCR3-positive T cells to sites of infection. Park et al. (Park et al., 2002) have reported increased susceptibility of CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice to bacterial infections and also suggest that CXCL9 expression serves to optimize antibody production through facilitating interactions between lympocytes and antigen presenting cells within secondary lymphatic tissues. Although we did not examine MHV-specific antibody production following infection of CXCL9\u2212/\u2212 mice, we don't believe that lack of CXCL9 expression altered a protective humoral response as there was no viral recrudescence within spinal cords nor increase in mortality during later stages of disease in mice infected with MHV-which is associated with deficiencies in antibody production (Ramakrishna et al., 2002, Ramakrishna et al., 2003). Examination of spinal cords of mice infected with either MHV-CXCL9 or MHV-cCXCL9 indicate no differences in the severity of demyelination supporting earlier studies that CXCL9 expression does not significantly influence white matter damage in mice persistently infected with MHV (Liu et al., 2001b).",

Indeed, administration of blocking antibodies specific for CXCL9 to mice infected with various hepatotropic viral pathogens results in alterations in liver pathology that is associated with a modulation in leukocyte recruitment and highlight the importance of CXCL9 in attracting activated CXCR3-bearing inflammatory cells (Arai et al., 2002, Hokeness et al., 2007, Kakimi et al., 2001a, Kakimi et al., 2001b, Salazar-Mather et al., 2000). Through use of mice deficient in CXCL9, our studies support and extend these earlier observations and indicate an important role for CXCL9 in promoting a protective response following MHV infection of the liver. However, protection afforded by CXCL9 was not associated with any sustained increase in T cells or NK cells within the livers indicating that CXCL9 exerts a protective effect independent of enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells. This finding is consistent with an earlier report from our laboratory demonstrating that infection of CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice with MHV-CXCL10 results in reduced viral titers within the livers and protection from hepatitis but is not associated with increased T cell or NK cell infiltration (Walsh et al., 2007). Signaling through NKG2D has been shown to participate in control of JHMV replication within the livers yet the mechanisms e.g. enhanced cytokine secretion and/or cytolytic activity by inflammatory cells has yet to be defined (Walsh et al., 2008). The mechanisms by which both CXCL9 and CXCL10 promote a protective response in the liver following MHV infection independent of enhancing immune cell infiltration is the focus of ongoing investigations.",

In brief, pMH54 contains the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a cDNA copy of the 5\u2032-most 0.5 kb of the MHV genome fused to the 3\u2032-most 8.6 kb of the MHV genome. The MHV sequence corresponds exactly to that of wild-type MHV-A59, with the exception that it encodes silent AvrII and AseI sites [introduced into the S protein open reading frame (ORF)] and three additional nucleotides that result in the creation of an Sse8387I restriction site 12 bp downstream of the S ORF) (Kuo et al., 2000). The three nucleotide addition results in an up-regulation of subgenomic mRNA4 synthesis for reasons that are not currently understood. For construction of plasmid pMH54-CXCL9, the CXCL9 ORF was cloned from cDNA derived from mouse brain mRNA obtained from an MHV-infected mouse at day 7 post-infection (p.i.) using CXCL9-specific primers. This construct (designated WT-CXCL9-1) was cloned into Stratagene's pPCR-Script Amp SK (+) cloning vector (San Diego, CA) and served as the template for the two PCR reactions that yielded i) CXCL9-MHV [CXCL9 coding sequence (CDS)] and ii) cCXCL9-MHV (inverted CXCL9 CDS with engineered stop codons). CXCL9-MHV and cCXCL9-MHV were each ligated into the pPCR-Script cloning vector and the resulting plasmid vectors were transformed into E. coli, grown to high concentrations, and subsequently purified using Midiprep Kits (Qiagen, Valencia CA). The inserts were released from specific plasmid vectors by cutting with the Sse8387I and BspE1 restriction endonucleases and gel purified fragments subsequently ligated into the pMH54 vector resulting in generation of pMH54-CXCL9 (wild type CXCL9 construct containing CXCL9-MHV insert) and pMH54-cCXCL9 (control construct containing inverted CXCL9 CDS with stop codons) (Fig. 2A). These plasmids were transformed into E. coli and purified plasmids pMH54/CXCL9 and pMH54/cCXCL9 were linearized with PacI restriction endonuclease and served as the templates for RNA synthesis.",
