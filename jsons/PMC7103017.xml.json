ADQI methodology begins with a pre-conference comprehensive literature search and appraisal of scientific evidence to identify key themes allotted to workgroups (ESM Table 1, ESM Table 2). Consensus statements were then proposed and supported by evidence and/or consensus where evidence was limited. Consensus statements were iteratively developed and refined in response to feedback during plenary sessions involving all ADQI delegates, and final consensus statements were agreed. After the conference, the writing committee compiled the rationale for each statement based on the identified literature. Recommendations for research were formulated for all key areas. Additionally, recommendations for practice were graded using the GRADE (Gradings of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria (Fig. 1, Table 1, ESM Table 3 and ESM Table 4) [8]. A detailed description of the methods is in the electronic supplemental material (ESM).",

One study evaluating 189,561 patients with COPD found an incidence rate of hospitalization for AKI of 128/100,000 person-years with AKI rates being significantly greater among patients with acute COPD exacerbation; however, underlying COPD severity (GOLD stadium) was not an independent risk factor [12]. In community-acquired pneumonia, AKI was common and associated with increased risk of death [13]. Evidence on the association between the use of IMV and the development of AKI is stronger, although it is difficult to dissociate the effects of primary lung disease from the consequences of treatment or the associated haemodynamic failure. Overall, an incidence of AKI between 25 and 60% in mechanically ventilated patients with ARF/ARDS is observed with a consistent independent association between AKI and mortality [4, 5]. A meta-analysis across heterogeneous patient groups also demonstrated a strong association between receipt of IMV and risk of AKI with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 3.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32\u20134.28) [5]. The effects of AKI on weaning from IMV have not been studied thoroughly. In a secondary analysis of 238 patients with AKI enrolled in the SAILS study, AKI for > 7 days was associated with prolonged requirement for IMV and longer ICU stay [11]. In a single-centre retrospective cohort study of patients receiving > 48 h of IMV, AKI was associated with longer duration of IMV and prolonged weaning [10].",

This leads to increased cytokine levels (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8) in the circulation and in kidney and lung tissue [16\u201319], as well as caspase-independent pulmonary apoptosis [18]. Correspondingly, it has been shown that ischaemia\u2013reperfusion injury, but not bilateral nephrectomy, leads to changes in lung transcriptome, suggesting that mechanisms other than uraemia alone lead to lung injury [16]. Furthermore, bilateral nephrectomy leads to a significantly decreased expression in the pulmonary predominant water channel, aquaporin 5 (AQP-5), possibly contributing to acute lung injury [20]. Some animal data suggest that the detrimental effects of ischaemia\u2013reperfusion induced AKI on the lung may be averted by IL-6 mediated upregulation of IL-10 production in splenic CD4+ T cells [21]. Subsequent experiments showed that splenectomy exacerbates lung injury after AKI [22].",

In the ARDSNet study, patients allocated to low tidal volume ventilation had fewer days of AKI, defined as sCr > 177 \u03bcmol/L (20 vs. 18 days; p < 0.005) [73]. However, analysis of a large, multinational database of patients with > 24 h of IMV and normal renal function failed to identify any ventilation-associated parameters as risk factors for AKI [74]. There are limited data related to the effects of lung protective ventilation on renal function in patients without ARDS. Secondary analysis of an RCT comparing higher tidal volume (10 mL/kg) to low tidal volume ventilation (6 mL/kg) in patients without ARF/ARDS showed no differences in risk of development or worsening of AKI [75]. Spontaneous breathing during IMV appears to be favourable in terms of renal perfusion and function as demonstrated in a small prospective randomized study in 12 ICU patients with mild ARDS [76]. In 16 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, prone positioning was associated with a small increase in intra-abdominal pressure but did not adversely affect renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, filtration fraction, urine volume, sodium excretion and free water clearance [77]. Additionally, another trial including 466 patients found a (non-significant) decrease of RRT requirement for prone positioning (11.4% vs. 17.1%) [78].",

However, this finding was inconsistent [84]. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), used in ARDS and pulmonary hypertension, may be associated with AKI [49]. A systematic review concluded that treatment with a high cumulative-dose of iNO significantly increased the risk of AKI compared with controls (relative risk 1.52; 95% CI 1.14\u20132.02; p = 0.004), whereas medium and low cumulative-doses did not [86]. No trials specifically designed to mitigate the risk of AKI during IMV have been conducted. Indirect evidence from general ventilation and ARDS studies implies that some management strategies carry a greater risk to kidney function (Table 3). For instance, patients treated with propofol and dexmedetomidine have a lower risk of AKI than patients receiving longer acting sedatives [36].",

Approaches depend on local practice, training and the patient population (adult vs. paediatric). Combining CRRT into the ECMO circuit may have several benefits, as no additional vascular access is needed [117]. However, problems may arise in the combined-circuit approach. First, it is unclear what section of the ECMO circuit is best to connect the CRRT device to, or if an in-line haemofilter should be used (Fig. 4a\u2013g). When using a centrifugal ECMO pump, the CRRT device must be placed post-pump to prevent air entrapment (Fig. 4c\u2013e). However, high circuit pressure post-pump may limit the ability of the CRRT device to return blood, frequently leading to pressure alarms. An alternative approach may be to withdraw blood from the ECMO circuit post-oxygenator and return it from the CRRT device post-pump (Fig. 4d). However, risk of air embolism is increased whenever a line is connected to the circuit post-oxygenator. Furthermore, recirculation into the CRRT circuit may occur with this approach and must be considered, when prescribing CRRT dosing. Furthermore, one must consider whether CRRT circuit interruption poses any risk to the ECMO circuit. In this regard, it is unclear if and how anticoagulation should be performed during combined ECMO and CRRT treatment. The feasibility of VV-ECMO with prophylactic anticoagulation only has been proven and may lead to fewer bleeding complications [118].",

In theory, RRT helps compensate respiratory acidosis and may remove CO2 through additional filters included in the CRRT circuit [extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R)] [96, 120, 121]. While ECCO2R showed some benefit in a trial including 33 patients and may have aided application of ultraprotective ventilation among ARDS patients [122], another one was terminated due to insufficient CO2 removal (PROVAP, clincialtrials.gov: NCT03004885).
