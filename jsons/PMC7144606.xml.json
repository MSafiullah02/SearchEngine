As the unprecedented waves of COVID-19 continues to plague many nations, we can take lessons from the epicentres that experienced this brutality. Retrospectively I could not agree more that the need for intensive care unit beds and staff is dire. Volunteers from the public and retired healthcare workers have stepped up to assist the overstrained healthcare system. Not only do the numbers of the workforce need to be scaled up quickly, but the welfare of the frontline workers also needs to be maintained. Many are experiencing burn-out, fatigue, anxiety, distress, and a myriad of mental burdens [2].",

Reducing and rescheduling of less urgent outpatient appointments will help to ease the manpower strain in the hospitals, allowing them to be deployed to designated wards and facilities. Hospitals have been implementing more stringent visitor policies. While some post-surgical patients would need rehabilitation and caregiver trainings that necessitates caregivers being around, numbers of registered caregivers should be limited to a minimum. At the end of the spectrum, many had been denied visiting their kin who are nursed in the ICU due to the highly virulent nature of the contagion [5].",
