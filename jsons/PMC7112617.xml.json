For the human MHC, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles possess an extremely high amount of polymorphisms (de Bakker et al., 2006, Marsh et al., 2010). Initially, the HLAs were classified into different serotypes according to their antigenicities (Marsh et al., 2010). Recently, with the identification of numerous peptides that bind to different HLA proteins, the peptide presentation characteristics of HLAs have given rise to a new categorization. HLA molecules with similar peptide binding features are grouped into the same supertypes (Lund et al., 2004, Naugler and Liwski, 2008, Sette et al., 2003, Sidney et al., 1996). Nine major supertypes of HLA class I (HLA I) proteins have been defined based on their shared overlapping peptide-presentation repertoires in the same supertype (Doytchinova et al., 2004a, Reche and Reinherz, 2007, Sette and Sidney, 1998, Sette and Sidney, 1999b, Sidney et al., 2008). Each supertype possesses similar peptide binding motifs.",

The A2 supertype includes HLA-A*0201 to HLA-A*0207, HLA-A*6802, and HLA-A*6901, etc. These alleles are characterized by a peptide motif of small or aliphatic hydrophobic residues (e.g., Ala, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Ser, or Thr) at both position 2 and the C-terminal position (Barouch et al., 1995, del Guercio et al., 1995, Doytchinova and Flower, 2002, Fogg et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2010a, Sidney et al., 2001). To date, although most of the defined immunogenic peptide epitopes are with the HLA-A*0201-restriction, dozens of cross-allele-presented peptides have been identified within the A2 supertype (del Guercio et al., 1995, Fogg et al., 2009, Mitchell et al., 2000). The A3 supertype mostly comprises HLA-A*0301, HLA-A*1101, HLA-A*3101, HLA-A*3301, and HLA-A*6801, etc., which present peptides with similar features such as preferences for small or aliphatic residues (e.g., Ala, Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Ser, or Thr) at position 2 and positively charged residues (Arg or Lys) at the C-terminus of the peptides (Doytchinova et al., 2004b, Guan et al., 2003, Hattotuwagama et al., 2007, Sidney et al., 1996).",

            "text": "Interestingly, two relatively common HLA types, HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801, possess only five polymorphic amino acids and belong to the same serotype HLA-A68 (Fernandez-Vina et al., 1992, Marsh et al., 2010). Three of the five polymorphic amino acids locate in the F pocket of the peptide binding groove, while the other two locate in the positions which have no direct effect on peptide binding or T cell recognition (based on the previous TCR-MHC complexes). However, based on their distinct peptide binding properties, HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 can definitively be grouped into the A2 and A3 supertypes, respectively (Sidney et al., 2008). Elucidation of the molecular basis of the divergent peptide presentation characteristics of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801, which determine their different HLA supertype classification, requires detailed structural exploration (Gostick et al., 2007). Furthermore, different disease correlation of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 was reported (Conway et al., 1997, Conway et al., 1996). It is indicated that HLA-A*6802 allele within the A2 supertype is associated with reduced risk of HIV-1 infection and transmission (MacDonald et al., 2001a, MacDonald et al., 2000, MacDonald et al., 2001b, Rowland-Jones et al., 1998). The particularly efficient HIV-specific CTL responses or present epitopes restricted by particular MHC alleles such as HLA-A*6802 may act as one of the restricting elements (Chen et al., 2012, Walker and McMichael, 2011, Wu et al., 2011). However, the association of HLA-A*6801 and HIV infection still remain in debate although it is reported that the HLA-A68 serotype is associated with higher viral load in HIV (Gostick et al., 2007, Ngandu et al., 2009, Tang et al., 2002). Therefore, it is indispensable to characterize the peptide presentation of HLA-A*6802 and perform a comparative analysis with its related allele HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*0201.",

In this study, we determined the crystal structures of both HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 complexed with their typically presented peptides, respectively, two of which are HIV-specific antigenic peptides (Env199 and RT313). The structure of HLA-A*6802 complexed with self peptide TRP2-180 derived from a tumor antigen TRP2 was also determined. The binding capabilities of the peptides to HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801, together with HLA-A*0201, were characterized. Our results provide a molecular basis for the supertype differentiation between HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*6802 and offer a structural reference for understanding HIV-specific T cell immunity among populations with different HLA supertypes (Lichterfeld et al., 2006, Ojesina et al., 2006).",

The peptides were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C as freeze\u2013dried powders and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before use. The cDNA of HLA-A*6802 (residues 1\u2013274) was obtained through overlap extension PCR utilizing HLA-A*6801 as a template, which was previously constructed in our laboratory (Gao et al., 2000). The HLA complexes were prepared using in vitro refolding as previously described (Garboczi et al., 1992, Li et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2011b). Briefly, the HLA heavy chain and human \u03b22m were expressed in inclusion bodies containing in Escherichia coli and co-refolded with peptides in a 400 mM L-arginine refolding buffer. Subsequently, the HLA complexes were purified using Superdex\u00ae 75 10/300 GL gel filtration chromatography and Resource-Q anion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). Before crystallization, the final buffer was exchanged to 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl.",

Diffraction data for HLA-A*6801/RT313 were collected using an in-house X-ray source (Rigaku MicroMax007 desktop rotating anode X-ray generator with a Cu target operated at 40 kV and 30 mA) and an R-Axis IV++ imaging-plate detector at a wavelength of 1.5418 \u00c5. In each case, the crystal was first soaked in reservoir solution containing 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant for several seconds and then flash-cooled in a stream of gaseous nitrogen at 100 K. The collected intensities were subsequently processed and scaled using the DENZO program and the HKL2000 software package (HKL Research).",

As expected, the overall structures of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 display the common characteristics of other structurally determined HLA I proteins including the previously determined HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*0201 structures (Fig. 1A\u2013C) (Bjorkman et al., 1987, Guo et al., 1992, Guo et al., 1993). The extracellular region of HLA-A*6802 heavy chain folds into three different domains: a typical MHC molecule superfamily domain formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains, and an immunoglobulin like \u03b13 domain which underpins the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains together with \u03b2-microglobulin. The peptides lie along the peptide binding groove formed by two \u03b1-helices and eight \u03b2-sheets within the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains.",

            "text": "The overall structure of HLA-A*6802 is extremely similar to that of HLA-A*6801, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.784 \u00c5 when the whole molecule of HLA-A*6801/RT313 was superimposed with HLA-A*6802/Env199 (Fig. 1D up left and down left). However, the superposition of the structure of HLA-A*6802/Env199 with the previously determined HLA-A*6802/Env199 structure generated an RMSD of 1.536 \u00c5 (Fig. 1D up right and up down) (Madden et al., 1993). This is concordant with the higher identity of the amino acid sequences of HLA-A*6802 aligned to HLA-A*6801 (98.2%) than the identity between HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201 (95.6%) (Fig. 2A). Crystal packing of the molecules within these structures has not direct interactions through the HLA helices and thus does not affect the overall structures. The structural alignments of the HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*6802 with the previously determined HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*0201 structures also illuminate the similar overall structures of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 but not HLA-A*0201. This may indicate a comparable antigenicity between HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801, which gives rise to the similar serotype classification of these two alleles. Furthermore, there are six polymorphic residues between HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*6801, and HLA-A*6802 that are exposed to the solvent (Supplemental Fig. 1). The solvent-exposed amino acid may locate in the serological recognition of the HLA molecules. Four out of the six polymorphic residues are conserved between HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*6802, but different from HLA-A*0201, which may contribute to the different serological typing of HLA-A*6801/6802 and HLA-A*0201. HLA-A*6801 has been indicated to be a weak binder for CD8\u03b1\u03b1 due to a polymorphic residue V245, which has previously been observed to change the conformation of the 223\u2013229 loop region in \u03b13 domain. This conformation shift of the 223\u2013229 loop is also observed in HLA-A*6802 structure compared to HLA-A*0201 which may indicate a weak CD8\u03b1\u03b1 binding for HLA-A*6802.",

However, the residues in the middle portion of the peptide Env199 presented by HLA-A*6802, is different from the Env199 presented by HLA-A*0201 (Fig. 3A). The HLA-A*0201-presented peptide Env199 adopts a bulged conformation, with the P6 residue Asn pointing out of the groove.

We determined the structures of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 with different peptides: Env199 and RT313, respectively. We found that the main chain conformation and the orientations of residue side chains are extremely similar between the two peptide presented by HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 (Fig. 3B and C). Both the P6 residues of the two peptides (Asn for Env199, Ser for RT313) point their side chains to the \u03b11-helix (Fig. 3C). The P6-Asn of Env199 and P6-Ser of RT313 form hydrogen bonds with the residues on the \u03b11-helix, e.g. Gln70 and Thr73 which are conserved between HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 (Figs. 2A and 3D). This indicates a secondary anchor role for hydrophilic residues at the P6 position of the peptides presented by HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801. However, for HLA-A*0201, the hydrophilic residue P6-Asn of Env199 does not form any contact polymorphic residue His70 (Fig. 2A), but protrude upward (Fig. 3C and D), which is concordance with the previous conclusion that the HLA-A*0201 usually has a hydrophobic secondary anchor at P6 position to poke into the groove. The hydrophilic residue such as Asn will be repelled out of the hydrophobic C pocket of HLA-A*0201.",

Structural analysis indicated that the static electrical statuses of the HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201 F pockets are quite different from HLA-A*6801 (Fig. 4C\u2013E). HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201 bear highly hydrophobic F pockets, while HLA-A*6801 possesses a negatively charged F pocket. The F pockets of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201 are formed by nearly identical residues, which include the similar hydrophobic residue Tyr116 located exactly at the bottom of the F pocket (Fig. 4F). However, the residues composing the F pocket of HLA-A*6801 are quite different, characterized by a negatively charged Asp116 forming a tight salt bridge with the Pc anchor Lys of RT313 (Fig. 4G). Although there are only five polymorphic residues between HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 (Arnett and Parham, 1995), three of them are located in the F pocket, which leads to a divergent peptide selection of these two closely related HLA alleles within the same serotype.",

The three peptides we studied here possess the typical residues (Val, Leu, and Ile) for the P2 anchor. This identical P2 anchor preference of HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6801, and HLA-A*0201 imply a largely similar B pocket formation of the three alleles. Based on our structures of HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6801 and the previous determined HLA-A*0201/Env199, comparative analysis indicated that the similar hydrophobic residues Tyr7, Tyr9 (Phe9 for HLA-A*0201), Ala24, Val34, Val67 form the bottom of the B pocket of HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6801, and HLA-A*0201 which adopt the side chain of the P2 anchor (Fig. 5A\u2013C). However, the HLA-A*0201 has a small B pocket entrance compared to HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801. A salt bridge at the edge of B pocket of HLA-A*0201 was observed between the two polymorphic residues Glu63 and Lys66 for HLA-A*0201 (Fig. 5D). Although the polymorphism of the residues at these two positions may not impact the P2 anchor selection of HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6801, and HLA-A*0201, the exposing of the two residues to solvent may influences the TCR-docking at this region of the MHC. This may contribute to the distinct MHC-restricted TCR recognition of HLA-A*6802/HLA-A*6801, compared to HLA-A*0201. Actually, the polymorphic residues at position 63 between HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201 also contribute to the different conformation of the P1 anchoring of peptide Env199 in the two related structures (Fig. 5D). In the structure of HLA-A*0201/Env199, a hydrogen bond is formed between Glu63 of heavy chain and P1 anchor Thr of Env199. However, no hydrogen bond is observed between Gln63 and P1 anchor Thr of Env199 in the structure of HLA-A*6802/Env199 (Table 2). This also indicates a subtle impact of the micropolymorpism between HLA-A*6802/HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*0201 on their peptide presentation and T cell recognition.",

Instead, D pocket of HLA-A*6802 accommodates Phe5 of peptide TRP2-180. In contrast, the D pocket of HLA-A*0201 accommodates the P3 residues in all of the HLA-A*0201-presented peptides to the best of our knowledge (Fig. 6A).",

This illuminates the contribution of allele-specific micropolymorphisms to the unconventional P3 Tyr anchoring of HLA-A*6802 presented peptide. A previous study indicates that the peptides presented by the HLA alleles from the A2 supertype prefer aromatic amino acids such as Tyr as secondary anchors at the P3 position (Sidney et al., 2001). Herein, base on the structure of HLA-A*6802/TRP2-180, a different binding mode for the P3 Tyr anchor of HLA-A*6802 is displayed when compared to other A2 supertype members (Liu et al., 2011a). In accord with the unusual P3 Tyr anchoring, the middle portion of the peptide binding groove of HLA-A*6802/TRP2-180 is wider than HLA-A*0201 (Fig. 6C), and a larger and deeper C pocket can be observed within the groove of HLA-A*6802 (Fig. 6D and E). This may be associated with the uncommon anchoring conformation of P3 Tyr which repels the underside and flank of C pocket of HLA-A*6802 peptide binding groove.",

However, the conformations of the polymorphic residues within the peptide binding groove of HLA-A*6802, especially the F pocket, are distinct from HLA-A*6801 but similar to HLA-A*0201. This determines the A2 supertype-like peptide binding motif of HLA-A*6802 as HLA-A*0201. Interestingly, the peptide presentation strategy of HLA-A*6802, e.g. the conformations of the N terminal and the middle portion of the peptide, are more homologous to HLA-A*6801 compared to HLA-A*0201. Therefore, our comparative structural analyses of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801 together with HLA-A*0201 indicate an unusual peptide presentation feature of HLA-A*6802 (Doytchinova and Flower, 2003), which may imply a unique pathogen specific T cell recognition within HLA-A*6802+ populations (Hogan et al., 1998, Rowland-Jones et al., 1998).",

Detailed sequence and structure analyses indicated that these alleles posses the A2 supertype specific residues (as Arg97, His114, and Tyr116) in F pocket, as HLA-A*6802 (Fig. 2A). However, within the B and C pockets, these HLA-A*6802-like alleles bear residues (e.g. Gln63, Gln66, and Asn70) which are distinct from typical A2 alleles (HLA-A2 serotype alleles, such as HLA-A*0201 to HLA-A*0207). The hybrid micropolymorphism of these HLA-A*6802-like alleles may lead to a featured peptide presentation characteristic as HLA-A*6802. Therefore, based on the structural properties of the micropolymorphism and potential different peptide presentations, the A2 supertype can be divided into two groups: Group1: HLA-A*0201-like (e.g. HLA-A*0201\u20130207, etc.) and Group2: HLA-A*6802-like alleles (e.g. HLA-A*6815, HLA-A*6827, HLA-A*6828, and HLA-A*6901, etc.). These two groups can present the peptides with similar motif at P2 and Pc positions but in subtle different conformations. A recent structural study elucidated the peptide presentation features of four HLA-A*0201-like molecules: HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*0206, and HLA-A*0207(Liu et al., 2011a). Herein our structures of HLA-A*6802 provide the insights into the peptide presentation of the HLA-A*6802-like group. Peptides with similar A2 supertype restricted motif can be presented by these two groups, but in different conformations. Furthermore, the TCR restriction may also differ between these two groups due to the polymorphic residues within the solvent-exposing region of \u03b11 and \u03b12 helixes. However, experimental exploration is needed to confirm the peptide binding and the TCR recognition features of A2 supertype alleles in a broader manner.",

Mitchell et al. reported that within six naturally displayed HLA-A2.1-restricted melanoma specific CTL epitopes, four of the epitopes can also be recognized in the HLA-A*6802 context by the cross-reactive CTLs (Mitchell et al., 2000). It is also indicated that HLA A2-restricted Epstein\u2013Barr virus-specific CTLs were able to lyse EBV-infected B cells expressing different HLA A2 supertype alleles including A*0201, A*0202, A*0203, A*0204, A*0206, A*6802 and A*6901 (Khanna et al., 1998). These findings indicated that although the peptide presentation of alleles (as HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*6802) within the A2 supertype can be subtly modulated by the micropolymorphism, similar peptides can still be presented by these alleles and subsequently induce cross T cell responses in different HLA allele individuals. The existence of the cross-reactive CTLs can be comprehended through the recent concept of the promiscuity of CTL recognition established by the broadly structure determination of cross-reactive TCRs and the related MHC complexes (Borbulevych et al., 2009, Lichterfeld et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2012, Mongkolsapaya et al., 2006, Yin and Mariuzza, 2009). In addition, the similar processing and transportation of the antigenic peptides within the antigen presenting cells (APCs) within different HLA alleles is also a prerequisite for the peptide cross-allele presentation and recognition (Walker et al., 2011).",

A dramatically similar overall conformation is observed between the two peptides presented by HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*2402 (data not shown). Similar to our structure of HLA-A*6802/TRP2-180, the Lys3 residue of peptide N1 in the HLA-A*2402 structure also locates in the C pocket but not D pocket in the peptide binding groove. In HLA-A*6802/TRP2-180, Gln70 of the \u03b11-helix of HLA-A*6802 grabs Tyr3 of peptide TRP2-180 through a hydrogen bond. Interestingly, for N1 presented by HLA-A*2402, intrachain hydrogen bonds between Lys3 and Gln5 is formed which stabilizes the main chain conformation of N1. Due to the hydrogen bonds contributed by the P3 anchor in C pocket, both of peptides TRP2-180 and N1 display a bulged conformation, in which the residues in the middle portion of the peptides protrude out of the peptide binding grooves. This bulged peptide conformation within HLA-A*6802/TRP2-180 and HLA-A*2402/N1 helps to expose the amino acids in middle region of the peptide for the TCR docking in T cell recognition.",

Moreover, these findings also provide beneficial reference points for viruses and tumors specific T-cell recognition of broadly cross-allele presented peptide, but still delicately restricted by polymorphic HLA.
