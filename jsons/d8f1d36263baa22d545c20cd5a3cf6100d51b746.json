Twenty-two countries, in four different regions (South East Europe, South East Asia, North and West Africa) were involved in the project titled \"Knowledge development and transfer of best practice on biosafety, biosecurity and biorisk management\". National Experts (NEs) from each country have been trained by intensive and e-learning courses to improve learning efficacy, to raise awareness and to foster networking as well as best practice sharing within each region. Consequently, the trained NEs disseminated the knowledge in their own countries, tailoring the courses on their local needs and expectations, amplifying the educational impact of the project. Here, we review the methodologies applied to develop a sustainable education and awareness system and the training contents related to biosafety/biosecurity/biorisk management.",

Some exceptional existing cases could be considered as examples or models, but we are far from achieving the necessary levels of biosecurity related education for life sciences students to be able to generate a culture of responsibility (Mancini and Revill, 2008) . Furthermore, there is also, in general, a lack of awareness of the risk of malevolent misuse of the biological sciences as demonstrated also by Dando and Rapper who conducted 90 interactive seminars with more than 2500 life scientists in 13 different countries (Dando and Rappert, 2005) .",

Scientists often recognize the biorisks related to pathogens they are researching accidentally infecting people and animals or contaminating the environment outside the laboratories, rather than recognizing the risk of theft or intentional malicious use of bioagents for biocrime and terrorism (Gaudioso, 2006) . Moreover, in her survey of Asian life scientists, Gaudioso described how the main means to manage biorisk management in laboratories are biosafety operations manual, institutional biosafety committee, biosafety training procedures, and laboratory management plan, while biosecurity issues do not figure as predominantly in most biorisk assessment, and simple biosecurity measures are utilized to protect laboratories containing pathogens or toxins (Gaudioso, 2006) . Therefore, in this context, biosafety education for scientists working with highly pathogenic microorganism and toxins is based on WHO and CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) manuals and, in some cases, on national or institutional regulations. Biosafety training and dissemination of good practices are mostly responsibility of the institutes where the pathogens are used and, as it happens for biosecurity principles, they are very seldom integrated in future scientists education as topics discussed during university courses.",

In total, the project trained 60 National Experts, and 410 National Participants, for a total of 470 trainers trained. These 470 trainers were doctors and technicians from hospitals, research institutes and industrial facilities so as officials from different ministries such as Health, Agriculture, Environment, Defense, Science and Technology, Internal affairs, Trade and, among the authorities, from Customs and Civil Protection in a multidisciplinary perspective. During the training sessions, the different background of the experts indeed helped and fostered the exchange of ideas and lessons learned, based on their own professional experience.",
