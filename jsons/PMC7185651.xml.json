The burden of stroke is particularly heavy in Asia, where it accounts for more than half of worldwide mortality from stroke. Acute intervention for ischaemic stroke is currently the subject of intensive clinical research. Among medical treatments, aspirin1, 2 and tissue plasminogen activator3, 4, 5 have been shown to have a beneficial effect on outcome. However, the treatment effect of aspirin is small, and use of tissue plasminogen activator is limited by its narrow therapeutic window.6 Antithrombotic agents are used in acute ischaemic stroke to inhibit clot propagation, prevent re-embolisation, and facilitate clot lysis.7, 8 However, randomised controlled trials have not found unfractionated heparin to be effective in improving functional outcome.2\n",

Four patients did not receive any trial medications and thus no data were recorded: two withdrew consent and two were ineligible due to presence of exclusion criteria (figure 1\n). 246 patients who were randomised (125 LWMH, 121 aspirin) were excluded from the primary analysis according to the protocol after vascular imaging investigations did not show any LAOD (15 with vascular imaging done before randomisation, 226 patients with vascular imaging done after randomisation) or because no vascular imaging could be done (n=5). Our primary study population comprised the 353 patients with confirmed LAOD: 164 patients with vascular imaging done before randomisation and 189 patients with vascular imaging done after randomisation.

Ischaemic stroke is a heterogeneous disease with three main stroke subtypes: cardioembolic, LAOD, and small vessel disease. Because of the diversity of stroke mechanisms, the best acute treatment of individual stroke subtypes may be different. Previous acute trials of anticoagulation have not systematically targeted underlying arterial lesions.23 In patients with LAOD, atherothrombosis is a common mechanism and thus anticoagulation may be particularly useful in this stroke subtype. A previous post-hoc analysis suggested that anticoagulation may be beneficial among patients with internal carotid occlusive disease.20 Among acute stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, microemboli were detected in 30% of patients by use of transcranial doppler monitoring, and 50% of patients had multiple acute infarcts on diffusion-weighted MRI, suggesting artery-to-artery embolism was an important stroke mechanism in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis.24 Although our data did not show a definitive benefit of LMWH over aspirin, the results were compatible with an earlier study on Asian patients who were at high risk of intracranial atherosclerosis.9 Moreover, the results also suggested that LMWH might be hazardous in patients without LAOD. Future large studies of anticoagulation on acute stroke patients with LAOD should be done to clarify the role of anticoagulation in different stroke subtypes.",

The Barthel index was used in this study and is the most commonly used disability measure in acute stroke trials.25, 26 However, the Barthel index is a not sensitive measure among patients with relatively mild stroke.27 The stroke severity of our patients was relatively mild: the median Barthel index score was 100 and 71% of patients had a score of at least 85 at 6 months. Several recent studies have used a dichotomised mRS score or combined several outcome measures in a global statistical test.28 The choice of primary outcome measure may determine whether a trial is positive or negative.5 Future studies on patients with intracranial atherosclerosis may consider using a dichotomised mRS score as the primary outcome measure.",

Patients without physical impairment but who are cognitively impaired may need help for their daily functions. The difference in cognitive outcome might explain the differences in disability status, although there was no difference in the NIHSS scores (a measure of physical impairment). However, the differences could also indicate small differences in the baseline MMSE in the groups. Our data suggest that future acute stroke trials should measure cognitive function as an outcome indicator.",

The use of (predominantly) ultrasound to delineate vascular lesion also strengthens the methodology of this study. However, use of open-label trial medication might have caused bias, even though the assessors at month 6 were unaware of treatment allocation. The use of the last observation carried forward method could introduce substantial bias. In addition, the relatively small sample size could provide misleading conclusions on possible benefit or hazard. However, the effect would be small in our analysis because there were only about 2% of missing data in our study. Nevertheless, the results of this study should resurrect interest in large clinical trials on anticoagulation in acute ischaemic stroke patients with LAOD, especially intracranial disease.",
