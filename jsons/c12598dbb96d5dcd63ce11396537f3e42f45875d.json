In the last decade, the elderly appear to be at increasing risk for infections with the opportunistic fungi. There are several reasons for this enhanced risk. First, with increasing realization that older adults with cancer should not be excluded because of age from intensive chemotherapeutic treatment regimens, there are more immunosuppressed older cancer patients. Second, as evidence for the efficacy and safety of transplantation in this population has accrued, solid organ transplantation is now more common in patients over the age of 60. Third, immunosuppressive regimens, including the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, are now routine in the management of rheumatologic and dermatologic conditions often found in older adults. Fourth, and possibly the most important risk factor for older adults, is the increasing role of treatment in intensive care units with the use of life-support systems, catheters, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

            "text": "Because of the life-threatening nature of these infections, the diagnosis of a systemic opportunistic fungal infection must be made promptly. Growth in culture of opportunistic fungi is rarely difficult; cultures are usually positive within a few days. The major complicating issue is that organisms as ubiquitous in the environment as Aspergillus or Rhizopus can easily contaminate specimens. Therefore, growth in culture must be carefully assessed as to whether it truly reflects infection (13) . Confounding the diagnosis of candidiasis is the fact that Candida are normal flora in the GI and genitourinary (GU) tracts and on skin, and thus, growth from samples taken from non-sterile body sites often means only colonization. However, growth of Candida from blood or normally sterile body fluids is obviously significant. In contrast to the other opportunists, C. neoformans is neither common in the environment nor part of the normal flora, and thus growth of this organism in culture always reflects infection.",
