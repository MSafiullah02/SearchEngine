Although rabies is a major public health concern in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and is reemerging in North America as bat rabies [1], no effective treatment is currently available in rabid humans or animals showing neurological symptoms. The virus invades the central nervous system (CNS) from peripheral nerves and induces furious or paralytic clinical symptoms in the infected host. In neurons, the virus replicates slowly with or without minimal cytolysis and inflammation [2].",

Proper post-exposure vaccination and injection of rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing rabies [3], [4], but is costly and is not commonly available in many countries [5], [6]. Furthermore, the protective effects of vaccination administered through ordinary routes (SC or intramuscular) do not prevent transneural spread of the pathogen, since antibodies in the blood will neutralize viruses only before they enter neurons or the nervous system [7], [8], [9]. Thus, more effective preventive and therapeutic measures against this neurotropic virus will require strategies for blocking transmission and/or transport into and within the nervous systems.",

Previously, we demonstrated complete protection against pseudorabies virus and RV challenge in peripheral tissue through IC immunization in mice [13], [14]. Significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibody were induced in the blood of IC immunized mice as compared to SC immunized mice; however the site of neutralization and clearance of inoculated virus in IC immunized mice was not determined. Here, we inoculated a lethal dose of live RV directly into the brains of IC immunized mice to assess the protective effects of IC immunization against rabies in the CNS.",

Positive signals were detected from 3 dpi in control and SC immunized mice and increased with time. Signals were present not only in cell bodies but also in nerve processes (Fig. 4e). In IC immunized mice, virus antigen was rarely detected in the brain, which was consistent with the results of Western blot analysis (see Fig. 3). However, a few positive signals were detected in nerve cell bodies in IC immunized mice at 5 dpi (Fig. 4f). The immunohistochemical results are summarized in Table 1\n. In addition, mild lymphoid cell depletion was observed in the spleens of mice that exhibited clinical symptoms, and there were no significant changes in any of the other organs.",

RV is a typical neurotropic pathogen that is distributed worldwide [1]. Although it remains controversial whether or not RV replicates in the muscles at the site of exposure [17], [18], [19], the critical preventive measure is blocking neuroinvasion and transneural spread of the virus. We previously showed that IC immunization followed by challenge with an intramuscular inoculation of a lethal dose of RV survived without any neurological symptoms, and there was no evidence of viral replication in the spinal dorsal root ganglia neurons in these mice [14]. In the current study, we demonstrated that IC immunization induces neutralizing antibodies in the brain and prevents RV spread in the CNS.",

Ultrastructural analysis indicates that most viral budding occurs on synaptic or adjacent plasma membranes [17]. There are at least two potential mechanisms of virus neutralization that would be consistent with the results of the current study. The first involves capture of inoculated virus by neutralizing antibodies induced in the CSF by IC immunization, before viral attachment and/or invasion of neurons, resulting in a dramatic decrease in infectious titer. However, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that at least some of the injected virus was able to infect neurons in IC immunized mice (Fig. 4). The other possibility is virus spread is inhibited by the neutralizing antibodies, which would mean that budding progeny virions are trapped by neutralizing antibodies before invading adjacent neurons. Although the precise mechanism has yet to be resolved, it is also possible that a combination of these two mechanisms contributes to the suppression of virus spread. Thus, the immune responses induced by IC immunization indicate that this approach may represent an effective therapeutic measure for CNS diseases caused by neurotropic pathogens.",

            "text": "Humoral immunity plays an essential protective role during the course of RV infection. Virus neutralizing antibodies that target virus glycoprotein play a critical role in protection mediated by T helper cells [22], [23], [24], [25]. The absence of a conventional lymphatic system and the presence of a blood\u2013brain barrier and blood\u2013CSF barrier make the CNS an immunologically privileged site. Recent reports however, have shown that immunization via the brain or CSF can elicit a systemic humoral immune response, characterized by production of antigen-specific antibodies in the cervical lymph nodes, spleen, serum and CSF [10], [11], [26]. Furthermore, intrathecal immunization via the subarachnoid or IC route yields a greater antibody response in the serum and CSF than extracerebral inoculation for a variety of inert antigens, including bacterial toxin and xenogenic albumin, and greater immunogenicity of CSF-administered antigen has been observed under a wide variety of conditions irrespective of the status of the blood\u2013brain barrier (i.e. intact or disrupted blood\u2013brain barrier) [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [26], [27]. The CSF drains primarily into the blood, deep cervical lymph nodes and lymphatics located in the connective tissue sheaths of the peripheral nervous system, and partly into fluid spaces lying along the spinal nerve roots and peripheral nerves [27], [28]. Thus, CSF is in direct contact with the extracellular fluid of the CNS, including synapses. The collection of CSF from mice in the current study was technically prohibitive; therefore, we estimated antibody production in the CNS by analyzing whole brain lysate (Fig. 3). Theoretically, these antibodies could be derived from two sources, plasma influx into the CNS across the blood\u2013brain barrier, or antibody-secreting cells located within the CNS. We previously observed a marked increase in antibody titer in CSF in rabbits immunized with inactivated influenza virus via the subarachinoid [12], however we did not observed comparable changes in SC immunized rabbits, despite high antibody titers in blood serum. In additional experiments, more than 80% of mice died after intracerebral virus inoculation which were immunized with high dose vaccine by SC route (200 \u03bcl, whereas 30 \u03bcl for IC immunization), and passive serum transfer also failed to rescue the rabid mouse (data not shown), suggesting the increased antibodies in blood could not work in the nervous tissues to suppress the viral spreading. Further, histopathological findings of perivascular edema or vasculitis were never observed in the brain of IC immunized mouse. We furthermore detected antibody-secreting cells in the brains of IC immunized mice by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, but not SC immunized mice (unpublished data). These findings suggest a mechanism involving synthesis of antigen-specific antibodies within the CNS. Recent reports also support the importance of antibody production by invading B cells in the clearance of RV from the CNS [29]. In conclusion, our results strongly indicate that IC immunization induces a humoral immune response in mice that may play a role in suppressing the spread of RV in the brain.",

Virus nucleoprotein was evident in perikaryon (arrow heads in d) and nerve processes (arrows in e) in control and SC mice, respectively (7 dpi, pons). Rabies virus antigen (arrow head) was also detected in some cells in the IC mouse brain (f, 5 dpi, thalamus). Bars are 30 \u03bcm.",
