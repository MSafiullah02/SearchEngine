A French multicentre study of severe pneumococcal CAP patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) reported an overall mortality rate of 29% [1]. The high mortality of severe CAP occurs despite the fact that the majority of patients receive an early and adequate antibiotic treatment. This is probably due, in part, to an imbalanced and disproportionate local and systemic inflammatory response that contributes to impairment of gas exchange, sepsis and end-organ dysfunction.",

Four focused on severe CAP [5, 7, 12, 13] and four others [6, 9\u201311] analysed severe CAP as a subgroup. In seven of these eight meta-analyses that evaluated patients with severe CAP, mortality was significantly decreased, with odds ratios ranging from 0.21 to 0.64. The length of stay was significantly reduced in the nine meta-analyses that assessed this outcome (in one it was not searched for [6]). Time to clinical stability was reduced by about 1 day in four meta-analyses [8\u201310, 14], while this reduction was not estimated quantitatively in another one [11], and this information was not assessed in the remaining five studies. In five out of seven studies that reported the data, hyperglycemia was significantly more common in the treatment arm. Gastrointestinal bleeding was not increased by the use of corticosteroids in the six meta-analyses in which it was specifically investigated. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and findings of these meta-analyses.\n",

            "text": "Despite the benefits observed in the meta-analyses and a reasonable frequency of side effects, the use of corticosteroids in CAP is still controversial and not routine. There are pitfalls in some of the RCTs included in these meta-analyses. First, the inclusion of patients with low severity may not be informative, since these patients have a low mortality and consequently it is very difficult to demonstrate differences in important outcomes such as treatment failure and mortality. Second, while critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency was not systematically assessed in these studies [15], few limited inclusion to those with high initial degrees of systemic inflammation. According to the rationale of using steroids in CAP, a high inflammatory response is necessary to benefit from this treatment. Patients with a high inflammatory response, i.e. high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), have higher rates of treatment failure and mortality [16]. Third, the dosages, the type and the length of treatment are very different among RCTs, which makes it very difficult to establish comparisons among them. Fourth, the primary endpoints are different between studies and some of them, such as length of stay or even time to clinical stability, could be considered \u201csoft\u201d, since the former depends on other variables and the latter is driven by the persistence of fever, which in fact is downregulated by corticosteroids. Finally, it should be noted that the small sample size of some individual studies included in these meta-analyses is a limitation.",

Also, rather than using mortality as a primary endpoint, we chose treatment failure, since it is associated with higher mortality of CAP.

We recommend selecting severe CAP patients with a high inflammatory response, as measured by CRP, at similar dosage and duration as we used in our RCT [17]. Methylprednisolone, prednisone or hydrocortisone at equivalent dosage appear similarly effective. Despite the fact that we excluded patients with influenza pneumonia in our trial because of data suggesting that corticosteroids are associated with increased mortality in influenza pneumonia, this association may not be present when adequate adjustments are made for time-dependent differences, and therefore these patients probably should not be excluded from corticosteroid treatment. In the future, we may find that other biomarkers are more specific in identifying patients who most benefit from this therapy, and we may have new therapies that are more selective regarding their anti-inflammatory impact on pneumonia.",
