            "text": "Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) are a major cause of morbidity and the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than 5 years on a global scale. They represent an important health and social problem due to the associated large number of doctors\u2019 office visits, hospitalizations, work hours lost by parents, and enormous medical and socio-economic costs. A systematic review estimated that, in 2010, 11.9 million episodes of severe and 3 million episodes of very severe ALRIs resulted in hospital admissions of young children worldwide [1]. Based on pathophysiologic processes, ALRIs can be divided into bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Bronchiolitis affects the smallest branches of the bronchial tree in children < 2 years of age and most often has viral etiology, whereas pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens [2]. A wide range of different viruses can cause ALRI of varying severity [3]. Strong similarities in the clinical manifestations of different viral infections make diagnosis based on clinical parameters unreliable. The use of sensitive nucleic acid\u2013based molecular techniques in current laboratory practice allows rapid and accurate etiological diagnosis, which can help in clinical decision making and may assist in measures to prevent nosocomial transmission.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics, during which 5\u201310% of adults and 20\u201330% of children are affected [4]. Children aged under 5 years, particularly children aged < 2 years, are a major risk group for severe influenza and complications. It was estimated that, in 2008, 20 million cases of influenza-associated ALRI and 1 million cases of influenza-associated severe ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years [5]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of ALRI in infants and young children and is the most frequently identified pathogen in cases of bronchiolitis. In 2015, this virus caused 33.1 million episodes of ALRI worldwide and resulted in approximately 3.2 million hospital admissions and 59,600 in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years [6]. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is closely related to RSV in its structural, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics, with disease severity similar or less than RSV [7, 8]. Human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1 and 2 are major etiologic agents of laryngotracheobronchitis (croup); PIV-3 and to a lesser extent PIV-1 are frequently associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children [9]. The clinical spectrum of human rhinovirus (RV) infections ranges from a mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia, and a significant proportion of the infections (~1/3) are asymptomatic. Rhinoviral ALRIs in early childhood, such as RSV infections, are associated with recurrent wheezing and asthma later in life [10]. Human adenoviruses (AdV) cause a wide range of respiratory diseases of variable severity and are a particular problem in immunocompromised children [11]. The human bocaviruses (BoV) are characterized by high levels of co-infections [12].",

In 2017, surveys were made all year round. The study population comprised children aged 0\u20135 years from different regions of Bulgaria treated for ALRI (bronchiolitis or pneumonia) in primary care settings or hospitals. Written informed consent from parent/guardian was obtained before enrollment. Children were only once included in the study. The diagnosis of each patient was determined by their attending pediatric physician based on standard clinical criteria. Bronchiolitis was defined as a combination of clinical symptoms and signs occurring in children aged less than 2 years including a viral upper respiratory infection prodrome, progressing to cough, tachypnea, expiratory dyspnea, prolonged expiration, and wheezing from a distance. Pneumonia was diagnosed based on clinical manifestations and X-ray changes. Diagnostic tests that were performed included blood analyses\u2014complete blood count with differential picture and C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest X-ray and bacterial cultures of respiratory specimens were performed only in children with clinical suspicion of bacterial complication. The patients with suspected viral etiology of illness (normal or slightly elevated white cell count and CRP) were selected. Children were excluded from the study if they had the following: (a) an underlying medical conditions increasing the risk of respiratory infections, including prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, and neurological or metabolic disease such as diabetes mellitus, hemoglobinopathies, immunosuppression, malignances; (b) hospitalization for any cause within the preceding 30 days.",

The detection and typing/subtyping of influenza viruses were carried out by a real-time RT-PCR method and the SuperScript III Platinum\u00ae One-Step qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Primers and probes were provided by the International Reagent Resource (IRR, USA). All samples were first tested for the presence of influenza A and B viruses. Those that were positive for influenza A were subsequently screened for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). The genetic lineage of detected influenza B viruses was also determined by real-time RT-PCR. Amplification was performed using a Chromo 4 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) in accordance with the protocol of CDC-Atlanta [13]. The detection of RSV, hMPV, PIV 1/2/3, RV, AdV, and BoV was performed using singleplex real-time PCR assays and an AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The primers, probes, and thermocycling conditions used in the study were identical to those previously described [14, 15]. Positive and negative controls were included in each run. For influenza type A and type B viruses, positive controls were provided by IRR, USA; for other targets, AmpliRun DNA/RNA Amplification Controls (Vircell, Spain) were used. Clinical specimens were tested in a separate real-time RT-PCR reaction for the RNAase-P gene, which provided verification of RNA integrity and the absence of PCR inhibition [13]. Subgroup-specific primers and probes targeting the RSV F and N genes were used for multiplex real-time RT-PCR to distinguish RSV-A from RSV-B, respectively, as described previously [16].",

Viral infections were detected in 271 (82.6%) patients with bronchiolitis and 131 (70.1%) with pneumonia. Among the patients with bronchiolitis, there were 42 cases of dual infections and 3 cases of triple infection; among the patients with pneumonia, there were 16 and 3 dual and triple infections, respectively. The proportion of detected influenza viruses among patients with bronchiolitis was 28 out of 328 (8.5%) and 40 out of 187 (21.4%) for pneumonia. Regarding non-influenza viruses, the proportions were 243/328 (74.1%) and 91/187 (48.7%), respectively. In the cases of pneumonia, influenza viruses were detected more commonly in children aged 24\u201359 mo as compared to those under 24 mo of age, whereas non-influenza viruses more often caused pneumonia in children under 24 mo of age (p < 0.05). In a 3-year-old child who died of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected. The most common virus associated with bronchiolitis was RSV (p < 0.05), accounting for 44.5% of the cases (115 cases as a single pathogen and 31 cases as part of co-infections), followed by RV (16.5%). Among the children suffering from pneumonia, RSV was also the most prevalent virus (25.1%) (p < 0.05), followed by AdV (11.2%) hMPV and RV (9.1%). In a 2-year-old child with pleuropneumonia and ARDS, RSV-A was detected. RSV and RV were more common pathogens of bronchiolitis than pneumonia, while influenza viruses and AdV were a more frequent cause of pneumonia compared to bronchiolitis (p < 0.05). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B viruses, hMPV, and PIV were mostly detected as a single pathogen in cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, while AdV, BoV, RV, influenza A(H3N2), and RSV were frequently identified in mixed infections. In cases of bronchiolitis, AdV was more commonly found as a part of mixed infections than as a single pathogen. In 26 children treated in the ICU, 12 (46.2%) RSV, 1 (3.8%) hMPV, 2 (7.7%) PIV, 5 (19.2%) RV, and 5 (19.2%) BoV were detected.",

            "text": "In this prospective study, we evaluated the incidence of the 11 most common respiratory viruses in 0- to 5-year-old children with ALRI in Bulgaria. During the study period, viral infections were detected in 78.1% of the cases of ALRI, with the lowest positive rate in the third season (p < 0.05). In the PCR-based surveys conducted in various countries, the percentages of proven viral infections in cases of ALRI varied greatly, i.e., 83.2% in China [17], 75.2% in Spain [18], 50.3% in Brazil [19], and 36.7% in Turkey [20], due to differences in climatic and geographic conditions, the study population, and the range of respiratory agents investigated. In our population, the proportion of viral infections in the cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia was 82.6% and 70.1%, respectively. These results are in agreement with previous reports in which viral pathogens were proven in over 90% of bronchiolitis cases [21\u201323] and in 43\u201381% of pneumonia cases [24\u201328]. Not surprisingly, RSV was the most frequently detected etiologic agent of ALRI, identified in 37.5% of the cases (44.5% in patients with bronchiolitis and 25.1% in patients with pneumonia), with a predominance of RSV subgroup B during the three seasons. RSV is known as a major pathogen in pediatric ALRIs, causing 50\u201390% of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis, 5\u201340% of those for pneumonia, and 10\u201330% of those for tracheobronchitis [23, 25, 29]. Consistent with other studies, the incidence of RSV infections was highest in the youngest age groups (< 6 months), which indicates higher susceptibility of this age group to RSV infection, and decreased with increased age due to the development of immunity after repeated infections [30]. The likelihood of occurrence of RSV infection immediately after birth points to the need for the administration of a RSV vaccine during the last months of pregnancy [31]. In the past decade, RSV treatments in development have included 10 vaccines and 11 therapeutic agents in active clinical trials [32].",

            "text": "In a systematic review, Goka et al. reported that the incidence of mixed viral infections ranged from 5 to 62%, with a mean of 23% [45]. In this study, the proportion of cases with co-detections was 15.9%. The most common participants in mixed infections were AdV, BoV, A(H3N2), PIV, and RV in which the proportions of co-infections were 52.8%, 44.4%, 40.9%, 33.3%, and 28.2%, respectively. The simultaneous presence of more than one virus in the same sample is difficult to interpret. Highly sensitive PCR assays make it possible to identify very small amounts of viral nucleic acids, which are present during the incubation period or the convalescence phase. The identification of more than one virus can be explained by the prolonged shedding of virus that caused a previous infection, coincidental upper airway infection, or asymptomatic circulation of some viruses. Prolonged BoV shedding has been reported for up to 4.5 months in hospitalized children [46]. Due to the frequent detection of BoV, RV, AdV, coronaviruses, and enteroviruses in asymptomatic healthy children, their PCR results should be interpreted with caution, especially in the cases of co-detection with other potential pathogens [12]. In contrast, RSV, influenza viruses, hMPV, and PIV are substantially more frequent in patients with pneumonia than in controls, and their PCR detection is likely to be causative of disease [47\u201349]. The use of quantitative PCR with assessment of viral load could be helpful for the interpretation of multiple positive PCR results. The clinical significance of mixed infections is still unclear. There are controversial views on the relationship between multiple pathogen infections and disease severity. A few studies have reported that there is no relationship between mixed viral infections and illness severity [50], while others suggest that co-infections could be associated with a more severe disease course compared to single infections [51].",
