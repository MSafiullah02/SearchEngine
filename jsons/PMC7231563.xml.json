The median number of days between intubation and ECMO was 3 days (range, 0\u20139 days). The median PaO2/FIO2 ratio, positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP), mean airway pressure, and lung compliance before initiation of ECMO were 70 (range, 52\u2013147), 15 cmH2O (range, 10\u201318 cmH2O), 21 cmH2O (18\u201327 cmH2O), and 28 mL/cmH2O (range, 13.6\u201370 mL/cmH2O), respectively. Selected laboratory data of the patients on admission were: median serum KL\u20106 (a marker of interstitial pneumonia) was 333 U/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 460 IU/L, and procalcitonin was 0.12 ng/mL. With regard to ECMO settings, the median blood flow was 4 L/min (range, 2.5\u20135.3 L/min), the median size of the draining cannula was 24 Fr (range, 21\u201325 Fr), and the median size of the infusing cannula was 20 Fr (range, 16\u201321 Fr). For antiviral treatment, lopinavir was used for 13/14 (93%) patients. All patients received empirical antibiotics (carbapenems or third/fourth generation cephalosporins). Ciclesonide, a glucocorticoid inhaler, was used for 4/13 (31%) of the cases. The effectiveness of any of the medications cannot be assessed at this time.",
