(Ad40 and 41 candidate viruses are serologically related.) 6 other adenovirus spccics were isolated; 6 samples gave equivocal results, and 18 were negative. A genus-specific ELISA with an antihexon coat yielded positive results in 40 out of 55 samples; the test failed to identify adenovirus antigen in 10 out of 17 specimens, which were found negative by culture. All of them were negative by immunfluorescence of inoculated Chang cell cultures. Hence the failures arc probably due to insufficient amount of virus in the samples. The predominance of only two adenovirus species associated with gastroenteritis in children and thc ease of cultivating and identifying them should help to elucidate their etiological significance.",

            "text": "The use of electron microscopy (EM) has focussed attention on various viruses as possible enteric pathogens in young children. Adenoviruses are secondary in frequency only to rotaviruses in faecal excretions [Brandt et al, 19791 . Most of the adenoviruses visualized by EM cannot be cultivated in cell cultures by conventional means; these will be referred to as \"enteric adenoviruses\" (EA) in this report. Johansson et a1 [1980] were able to recognize antigenically related adenoviruses by a type-specific ELISA in eight out of nine EM-positive faecal specimens. Kidd and Madeley [I9811 passaged some of the EA in Chang's conjunctival cells with CPE; again most of them appeared to be identical by neutralization (SN) with an antiserum prepared against an enteric adenovirus strain. Hence, most of the EA appear to be related antigenically; they had been provisionally called adenovirus 38 (Ad38) candidate virus [De Jong et al, 19811 ; the number had to be changed later. It turned out, however, that these fastidious adenovirus strains represent two clusters of strains which, although serologically closely related, exhibit great differences in their DNA structure [Wadell et al, 1980, in press] . Since it is difficult to distinguish the two variants by serological methods, they are being referred to as Ad40/ 41, with the knowledge that this complex includes (at least) two viruses. Even so, if Ad40/41 can be identified in cell cultures, it is a step forward to indicate the etiological role of EA for gastroenteritis in children, which is as yet unproven.",

Chang cells are well suited for cultivating other human adenoviruses as well [Kidd et al, 19821 . Chang's conjunctival cells allow some multiplication of at least some strains, as shown by passage, by immunofluorescent cell counting (data not shown), and by inhibition experiments with BUdR [Kidd and Madeley, 19811 . Cell cultures of higher susceptibility are desirable. Possibly a better growth may be obtained in Graham 293 cells [Takiff et al, 19811 or in tertiary cynomolgus kidney cells [De Jong et al, 1981, 19821 , but certainly not in human embryonic kidney cells which are superior for the isolation of most other human adenoviruses. Ad40141 appear to undergo an abortive replication cycle in HEK cells, since they may show a CPE in them, but cannot be passaged [Gary et al, 1979, Kidd and Madeley, 19811 .",
