A score was recorded with only 36% of all respiratory samples collected and in half of these the score exceeded 2. Although the majority of all samples were taken without a logged score, NTS sampling increased 4\u2010fold following the introduction of the screening tool, with RV detection in 25% of samples without a logged score during episodes of RTI. This is comparable with viral detection from samples scoring \u22652 and may suggest that CS was performed but scores were not recorded.",

While NPA obtains the highest viral burden from the URT (21), paired NTS have a sensitivity equivalent to NPA in children (22). While this may not be the case in adults, owing to lower viral loads (23), sensitive molecular methods were used to optimize RV detection. NTS cause less pain than NPA in children (24) and adults (25, 26). NTS were used in this study because of their greater tolerability in adults (especially HSCT recipients who may have complicating factors such as mucositis), particularly as multiple specimens were collected from each patient. Additional benefits of NTS include greater ease of collection by nurses, and consequent earlier collection than with NPA, which requires additional equipment and expertise (24). RVs were detected in a greater proportion of NTS during episodes of URTI than LRTI. As URT specimens are less sensitive for RV detection than BAL during LRTI (27), it remains essential to consider BAL in the absence of a positive RV in this setting (7).",

We noted 23% of PCR\u2010positive RVs were also positive by IF. While PCR can detect 15 individual viruses and IF only 7 of these, IF was positive for only 45% of the 7 viruses positive by PCR. The superior performance of PCR for these 7 viruses is well known, with sensitivity of IF in symptomatic children of 63\u201370% (28). IF for ADV is known to be insensitive (15\u201330% in symptomatic children [28]), and 0 of 10 PCR\u2010positive samples in the current study were detected by IF. In adult HSCT recipients, the poor sensitivity of IF compared with combined IF, PCR, and viral culture in nasal wash specimens has been documented previously for influenza (1/3 samples), RSV (3/6), and PIV (2/18) (29). We have confirmed these results with a larger sample and paired NTS specimens. In addition, more than half of all positive specimens were viruses not detectable by IF kits, showing the importance of broadening the panel for RV testing. While multiplex real\u2010time PCR for 13 RVs is now available at a relatively low cost (30), its use is dependent on laboratory resources and practicalities.",

Although IF testing is potentially rapid (within a working day), it is insensitive, hence infection control measures should be maintained pending results of PCR.
