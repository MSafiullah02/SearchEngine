            "text": "Along with seasonal influenza vaccines, antivirals have played a critical role in controlling influenza virus infection and transmission. They are most important when a viral strain which cannot be neutralized by the existing vaccines emerges, as occurred during the 2009 pandemic (Miller et al., 2013). Two classes of antivirals were approved for preventing and treating influenza. The first one comprises adamantanes, including amantadine (AMT) and rimantadine. They inhibit the ion channel function of influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (M2) that is required for endosomal acidification during the virus entry step (Das, 2012, De Clercq, 2006, Pinto et al., 1992). However, despite their high efficacy, adamantanes are no longer recommended for the treatment of influenza infections due to a very high prevalence of drug resistance among the circulating seasonal influenza viruses (Belshe et al., 1989, Saito et al., 2003). For example, in Republic of Korea during 2005\u20132010, the frequency of AMT resistance of seasonal influenza A was 30% for H1N1 and 76% for H3N2, and that of pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09) was 100% (Cho et al., 2013). The second class is neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir (Das, 2012, De Clercq, 2006, Samson et al., 2013, von Itzstein, 2007). They suppress the NA activity required for cleavage of neuraminic acid moieties from cellular receptors and glycoproteins of newly synthesized influenza virions. These antivirals have been shown to be highly effective against currently circulating influenza viruses and thus are recommended for the coming influenza season. In fact, 99.6% and 100% of the 2009 H1N1 viruses were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir, respectively, for the 2012\u20132013 season (CDC, 2013). However, according to earlier surveillance studies, 100% and 99.8% of A(H1N1) viruses had reduced oseltamivir susceptibility in Japan and Republic of Korea, respectively, for the 2008\u20132009 season (Baranovich et al., 2010, Choi et al., 2011). Moreover, Leang et al. (2013) also reported that cases of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1pdm09 infections with the H275 NA mutation increased during 2011 in Australia, compared with the first year of the pandemic. This sporadic appearance of oseltamivir resistance of seasonal influenza viruses prompts a note of caution against a potential pandemic situation caused by an NA inhibitor-resistant human influenza virus with high pathogenicity and transmissibility. Thus, development of novel antiviral agents overcoming resistance issues of the first-line antiviral drugs could be worthwhile to pursue urgently. Currently, antiviral researchers are trying to develop a second generation of antivirals by designing NA inhibitors to induce a formation of a stabilized covalent intermediate of NA or by targeting other viral proteins or cellular proteins involved in virus replication (Das, 2012, Kim et al., 2013a).",

Based on the results, 15b had similar activities to 15a, which suggests that replacement of the sulfur at X with oxygen still maintain the antiviral activity. However, the antiviral activity was abolished at 15c, indicating that the non-substituted hydrogen at R1 or the linked position of the indole substituent play a significant role for the activities. When the methyl group at R2 was replaced with a phenyl group (15d), the EC50 values increased two- to threefold compared with those of 15a. Removal of 5-fluorine in the indole group (15e) led to the complete loss of antiviral activity. Interestingly, when the indole group at R3 was substituted with benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl or 2-yl without fluoride to yield 15f or 15g, respectively, both compounds were active. It additionally shows that the linked position, either 2 or 3, of the bicyclic substituents might not be a critical factor for their antiviral activity. However, the derivatives with 3-methylbenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl at R3 (15h and 15i), had a severe loss of inhibitory function, indicating that introduction of a methyl group close to the linked position of R3 is unfavorable. Taken together, these data suggest that sulfur and oxygen are acceptable at X, whereas substitution of the hydrogen at R1 with a methyl group or the methyl group at R2 with a phenyl group is not desirable for maintaining the antiviral activity of 15a. Furthermore, an optimal bicyclic substituent appeared to be 5-fluoroindole or unsubstituted benzo[b]thiophene.",

            "text": "To explore the SARs of the R3 position further, a variety of compounds were prepared with monocyclic R3 substituents 15j\u2013x (Fig. 1C and Table 2\n). The antiviral activities of 15j, which had a thiophen-3-yl substituent at R3, were improved threefold compared with those of 15a, with EC50 values of 5.0\u20136.2 \u03bcM and no toxicity in uninfected MDCK cells at 900 \u03bcM. 15j was three- to fivefold more active than its bicyclic cognate 15f, which indicates that monocyclic thiophene could be a more suitable substituent than bicyclic benzo[b]thiophene at R3. To evaluate the substitution effects in the X and R2 positions, while keeping R1 and R3 of 15j intact, 15k with an oxygen at X and 15l with a phenyl at R2 were prepared, respectively. 15k exhibited significant toxicity with a CC50 value of 19.8 \u03bcM and 15l had no antiviral activities except with the A/Hong Kong/8/68 strain. Replacement of the thiophene in 15j with a furan (15m) resulted in a three- to fivefold less active compound. 15n, an oxygen version of 15m at X, was also toxic (CC50, 61.9 \u03bcM) and inactive, as found with 15k. Other compounds with imidazoles (15o and 15p) at R3 showed no anti-influenza activity, even at 100 \u03bcM. 15q, a monocyclic R3 version of 15g, was comparable to 15j, and the EC50 values ranged from 6.8\u20137.5 \u03bcM against all three influenza viruses tested. In contrast to 15l, 15r, a phenyl R2 version of 15q, was still active with EC50 values between 15.1 and 31.7 \u03bcM, although less potent than 15q. To investigate whether modification of the thiophene ring in 15q contributed to the influenza inhibitory effect of the monocyclic compounds, an additional series of derivatives (15s\u2013w) was synthesized and their antiviral activity was tested. Addition of a methyl group at position 3 (15s) or position 5 (15t) of thiophene yielded comparable antiviral activities to those of 15q. Notably, 15s, a monocyclic R3 version of 15h, was far more active than 15h. Substitution with an ethyl group at position 5 (15u) was active but had a reduced inhibitor effect than that of 15t. However, the addition of an electron-withdrawing bromide at position 4 (15v) or 5 (15w) of thiophene decreased or nullified the antiviral effect. Table 1 shows that methylation at R1 (15c and 15i) resulted in the loss of the antiviral activities of bicyclic substituents. By contrast, a methyl group (15x) at R1 of monocyclic substituents maintained the antiviral activities like R1-unmethylated 15s. Taken together, these results suggest that the anti-influenza viral activities of 15a can be maintained by substituting the bicyclic R3 with a monocyclic thiophene or furan ring, but not with an imidazole ring. The alkyl and bromide substitutions of the thiophene-2-yl at R3 indicated that the addition of electron-donating groups on thiophene-2-yl appeared to be preferable to electron-withdrawing groups for improving the antiviral activities. In contrast to the bicyclic compounds, the introduction of sulfur at the X position in monocyclic derivatives was more desirable than oxygen for reducing the toxicity, whereas the substitution of hydrogen with a methyl group at R1 did not affect the antiviral activities. Particularly, the seven active compounds, including 15a, 15g, 15j, 15q, 15s, 15t, and 15x, showed S.I. values over 50.0 (Table 1, Table 2). However, calculation of their exact S.I. was not available, because of DMSO-derived cytotoxicity at a concentration higher than 1000 \u03bcM (containing 2% DMSO).",

This showed that EGCG reduced the overall NP signal intensity in the cells (Kim et al., 2013b). By contrast, NP distribution and intensity in cells was not affected by 15q, which was similar with that of the DMSO control. These results suggest that 15q has no effect on the virus entry. To further examine involvement of 15a and 15q in viral RNA replication, an influenza polymerase activity assay system was introduced, where an influenza virus-like RNA containing FLuc served as a reporter gene. The results clearly showed that the PR8-derived viral RNA polymerase function in Vero cells was not changed by 15a or 15q, whereas it was suppressed by the influenza viral polymerase inhibitor T-705 (Fig. 4B).

Notably, they suppressed the PR8 NA activity with IC50 values of 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas 15i, which was inactive in the CPE reduction assay (Table 1), did not (Fig. 5\nA). This finding also appeared against other viral strains, A/Hong Kong/8/68 and B/Lee/40 (data not shown). In addition, based on a previous report (Vavricka et al., 2011), in silico molecular docking analysis was performed by using 15a as a ligand for the PR8 NA protein. Conformationally, it fitted with the active site of the NA protein via interaction with amino acids R118, E222, R292 and R371 (Fig. 5B). The indole part of 15a formed cation-\u03c0 interactions with R292 and R371. And fluorine of the indole in 15a was found to be involved in a weak hydrogen bond with R118, explaining the reason for the complete loss of activities of 15e (Table 1). Notably, hydrogen at the R1 position of the core skeleton made a hydrogen bond with E227. In accordance with this observation, 15g, which has a very similar structure and antiviral activity to those of 15a, was successfully loaded at the active site of NA (data not shown). However, inactive 15i, which was methylated compounds at this position, failed to be stably loaded. It was further confirmed that 15a suppressed the function of the oseltamivir-resistant NA protein [NA (H275Y)] as efficiently as that of the wild-type NA derived from influenza H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) (Fig. 5C and D). Taken together, these data suggest that the antiviral activity of dihydrofuropyridinones is expressed by their occupying the active site within NA and thereby blocking the enzymatic activity.",

However, there was no consensus in the chemical structures between their abilities for inhibiting the perforin-induced cytolytic effect and for suppressing influenza virus replication. For example, 15f, 15g, 15q, and 15t were active, whereas 15e was inactive in both studies. In contrast, 15j and 15m exhibited antiviral activities in the present study, but none in the previous study (Lena et al., 2008). To exclude the possibility that the anti-influenza activity of the dihydrofuropyridinones was gained from their intrinsic property improving cell viability nonspecifically, we repeated the MTT-based antiviral assay against other cell lysis-inducing viruses such as HSV, FECV, CoxB, and HIV. However, the anti-influenza viral compounds 15a, 15g, and 15q failed to show antiviral function against them (data not shown), indicating that their antiviral activity is influenza virus-specific. Furthermore, our mode-of-action study and in silico docking analysis with some active compounds suggested that their antiviral effects may occur at a late stage, particularly the NA-mediated virus release step, but not at any step of the virus entry or the viral RNA replication (Fig. 4, Fig. 5).",
