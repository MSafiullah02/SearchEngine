Ang-(1-7) protects lung from injury, through reducing both inflammatory response by lowering cytokine release 8 and pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting fibrotic signaling pathways 9 . Thus, inhibition of ACE2 will increase Ang II level and decrease Ang-(1-7), promote fibrosis and inflammation and injure lung tissues (Figure 1 ). Among proposed candidate drugs, panobinostat and trichostatin-a were shown to inhibit pulmonary fibrosis 10, 11 , while geldanamycin, COL-3 and narciclasine inhibit inflammation 12-14 , to attenuate lung injury in animal model (Figure 1 ). Panobinostat is a hydroxamic acid and can act as a non-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. It was approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Panobinostat was reported to reduce pulmonary fibrosis by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis fibroblasts 10 .",

There were two lung cell lines, A549 and HCC515, that were treated with 10 \u00b5M moexipril, an inhibitor of ACE2 and ACE, a homologue of ACE2. Gene expression profiles were collected from A549 and HCC515 cells at 6 and 24 h after treatment. Upon moexipril treatment, ACE2 level decreased with time in HCC515 but increased in A549, prompting us to focus the analysis using HCC515 line, which showed the inhibition effect of moexipril. The gene expression profiles used to simulate gene expressions in lung with the inhibition of ACE2 by spike protein of (SARS)-CoV-2.
