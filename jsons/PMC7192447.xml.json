In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a case definition for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) in an attempt to standardize global surveillance of hospitalization related to influenza (flu)\u2014allowing national health authorities to interpret their data in an international context [2]. Flu is particularly difficult to surveil because its clinical presentation is often indistinguishable from other respiratory viruses [3]. With that in mind, the WHO designed the SARI criteria to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity, while also noting that the case definition is not necessarily intended to capture all cases but to describe trends over time [4].",

Only a handful of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the criteria by including both SARI-positive and SARI-negative patients, allowing them to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the criteria for detecting flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [14\u201319].

If understanding the true burden of disease is desired, a higher sensitivity is important. While the SARI case definition was initially intended for flu surveillance, several studies have since used it for surveillance of other respiratory viruses [16\u201318, 22\u201324].

Comparisons to previous studies are nuanced due to differing age stratifications, but this result is similar to the 52% sensitivity reported by the Amini (2017) study in Quebec for children <1 year; however, it is lower than the 79.2% found in that same study for its one to four-year-old age group [14]. Similarly, two studies in Kenya that reported results for participants aged two months to four years found sensitivities of 84.3% and 89.6% [15, 24]. The specificity of the criteria for detecting flu in our study (60.6%) also differs from what was found in the aforementioned studies (13.1%-29.5%). The age distribution differences likely explain these discrepancies as our cohort consists only of children under two years, and the SARI criteria were the least sensitive (15.9%) and most specific (80.5%) for detecting flu in our patients under three months, who make up 45.4% of our study population. The sensitivities and specificities of the criteria for our patients aged 3\u20135 months (72.2%, 50.4%) and 6\u201323 months (75.4%, 39.9%) are more closely aligned with the findings of the previous studies.

For children <3 months, our study showed a sensitivity of 25.2%, lower than the 55% found by Rha (2018) in South Africa [17]. However, our 74% sensitivity in the 6\u201323 months age group more closely matched their groups of 6\u201311 and 12\u201323 months with sensitivities of 77% and 81%, respectively. The latter result is also in line with the findings of Nyawanda (2016), which reported sensitivities for children <1 year at 79.4%, and one to four years at 86.2%. Our finding for the specificity of the criteria was greater than these two previous studies across all age groups but differed most from Rha for children less than three months (85% vs 54%). Similar to Rha, however, the specificity of the criteria in our study for our oldest age group (6\u201323 months, 47.7%) was nearly half that of our youngest age group (85.1%). One potential explanation for differences between our studies is the use of singleplex RT-PCR in our study versus the multiplex RT-PCR that was used in Rha, with singleplex historically being more sensitive. Given that RSV vaccines are in the pipeline, it is important to also capture all cases of RSV to determine the true burden of illness to document if the vaccine is effective at impacting disease. Thus, if the SARI definition is used for ARI surveillance studies, it will once again underestimate the burden of RSV illness, and therefore altering the inclusion criteria to include either fever and/or cough may be more accurate.",

The SARI criteria performed poorly with regards to sensitivity for the detection of any respiratory virus in children under three months. Only 22.4% of children in this age group with a respiratory virus were captured by the case definition. This increased to 64.3% in children aged 6\u201323 months. Conversely, the criteria are very specific in the youngest age group for detecting any respiratory virus compared to the oldest age group (90.6% vs. 64.3%).",

Specifically, the lower rates of fever\u2014and to a lesser extent, cough\u2014in patients <3 months who are respiratory virus-positive account for the poor sensitivity of the SARI criteria in this age group. Only 44.4% of the virus-positive patients <3 months had a reported or measured fever, compared to 75.5% of their 6\u201323 months counterparts. Consistent with what has been found in previous studies [25], removing fever from the SARI criteria greatly increased the sensitivity of detecting any respiratory virus in children <3 months, particularly for RSV, which then increased by 65.3% [18]. Notably, both the PPV and NPV for detecting RSV also increased with this change. In general, for this youngest age group, removing fever as a criterion increases sensitivity more than it decreases specificity for each virus tested, and it results in minimal changes to PPV and NPV. This result would seem to advise caution when mandating that fever must be included as a criterion for this age group.",

It is the first to report the diagnostic accuracy of the WHO SARI criteria for detecting multiple viruses, including but not limited to flu and RSV. It is also the first study of this kind in the Middle East. Our prospective study took place over three years, included very young children, and included both fever and/or respiratory criteria, which allowed us to compare SARI-positive to SARI-negative children. Our study also has a number of limitations. It only includes hospitalized children <2 years who had ARI symptoms from one large hospital in Amman, Jordan. This limits its generalizability to other locations, or to study populations that include all hospitalized patients. Additionally, the 2011 SARI criteria were developed during our study period. While our study design allowed us to capture all the necessary elements to determine which patients met SARI criteria, it involved combining together the data as opposed to a straightforward data collection tool. Part of the data used in this study also included a parental survey of symptoms\u2014introducing a source of reporting bias.",

The ultimate goal of such surveillance is \u201cto minimize the impact of the disease by providing useful information to public health authorities so they may better plan appropriate control and intervention measures, allocate health resources, and make case management recommendations\u201d [4]. However, our study found that more than half of the RVI cases would have been missed using the SARI criteria. Therefore, it is critical to know how well these criteria perform in different patient populations and geographic settings. Our study shows that use of the criteria in children <3 months significantly underestimates the burden of disease for RSV, flu, and other viruses. Therefore, removing fever as a mandatory criterion in this age group, particularly for RSV, would greatly increase sensitivity with an acceptable decrease in specificity. Overall, more studies need to be conducted in the Middle East to gather more information on this finding; however, it is advisable that policymakers are cautious when using the SARI criteria.",
