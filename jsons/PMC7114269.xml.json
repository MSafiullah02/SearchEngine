The absence of an appropriate in vitro system for their propagation and amplification has constrained studies on such viruses and has hindered vaccine development. Attempts have been made to employ fowlpox virus, adenovirus and baculovirus as delivery vectors for expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomic DNA or HCV genomic cDNA in hepatocytes, and infectious virus particles were reported to be produced in the transduced cells (Lucifora et al., 2008, Ren and Nassal, 2001, Yao et al., 2008, Yap et al., 1998).",

In addition, recombinant baculovirus has been used to amplify an adeno-associated virus vector in insect cells and recently Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV), an insect virus that infects aphids, was successfully generated in insect cells from recombinant baculovirus (Aslanidi et al., 2009, Pal et al., 2007). However, it remains an open question whether vertebrate viruses can be generated in insect cells by use of appropriate baculovirus recombinants. In this paper, we have used porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model virus to address whether infectious mammalian virus particles can be generated in insect cells from recombinant baculovirus.",

The PRRSV genome, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA approximately 15 kb in length with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyA-tail, contains at least nine open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1a and 1b encode a polyprotein that is processed co- and post-translationally to generate the mature nonstructural protein (nsp) required for virus replication. The other seven ORFs encode seven structural proteins designed glycoprotein (GP) 2, envelope (E) protein, GP3, GP4, GP5, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein, respectively (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Expression of PRRSV structural proteins, as reported for coronavirus structural proteins, requires subgenomic (sg) mRNA synthesis by a mechanism of discontinuous transcription (Pasternak et al., 2006). The only known natural host for PRRSV is the pig, and the virus has been shown to infect primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) as well as a monkey kidney epithelial cell line, MA-104, and its derivatives including MARC-145 cells.",

However, the particles of AcAPRRS were morphologically identic to baculovirus virions (Fig. 3B).

            "text": "Baculovirus vectors have previously been exploited to amplify viruses that propagate on hepatocytes, including HBV and HCV, but the baculovirus approach has not yet been applied to the amplification of viruses that lack appropriate cell lines for in vitro propagation (Lucifora et al., 2008, Yao et al., 2008). We report that infection of insect sf9 cells with the recombinant baculovirus AcAPRRS led to the synthesis of PRRSV proteins and the culture supernatant contained particles that were morphologically indistinguishable from PRRSV virions. These findings demonstrated that the PRRSV genomic cDNA contained within AcAPRRS was transcribed for protein synthesis and PRRSV RNA was actively packaged into virus particles. The recombinant baculovirus approach could therefore provide a general method for propagating viruses, notably RNA viruses, for which no appropriate in vitro culture system is as yet available.",

            "text": "In the present study, the titers of PRRSV particles produced from baculovirus-infected insect cells were relatively modest (\u223c103.3\n TCID50/ml). This may be due to the fact that the genomic cDNA is inserted downstream of two promoters, the polyhedrin promoter and the CMV promoter. Transcription initiation at the CMV promoter was thought to generate intact genomic PRRSV RNA, but the CMV promoter is only poorly active in insect cells (He et al., 2008). Further experiments will be required to address whether direct linkage of PRRSV genomic sequences to a strong promoter sequence active in insect cells would significantly increase virus titers.",

Baculovirus is generally considered to be a safe vector. Transduction of mammalian cells appears to take place efficiently but there are no manifest adverse effects and the baculovirus genome is not transcribed and is unable to replicate (Kost and Condreay, 2002, Tjia et al., 1983). Baculovirus can transduce diverse mammalian cell types and has been exploited as a vector for gene therapy and for DNA vaccine delivery (Kost and Condreay, 2002, Tani et al., 2003). It was previously reported that baculovirus expressing the E2 glycoprotein of HCV under the control of the CMV immediate-early promoter\u2013enhancer elicited specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following intramuscular inoculation of mice (Facciabene et al., 2004). In this study, we have demonstrated that a recombinant baculovirus carrying PRRSV genomic cDNA was able to generate infectious PRRSV following transduction of mammalian cells that are themselves refractory to infection with PRRSV in vitro. This approach may therefore provide an alternative route for vaccine development, particularly if combined with the expression of genomic cDNA derived from an attenuated virus strain. It is possible that direct inoculation of such a recombinant baculovirus into animals or humans could generate infectious vaccine virus in vivo and thereby induce effective anti-viral immunity. Because baculovirus can be cultured on insect cells in the absence of serum, this avoids the potential risks of contamination associated with the use of animal products.",
