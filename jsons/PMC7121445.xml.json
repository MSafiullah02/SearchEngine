Although a broad variety of differential diagnoses must be considered, ranging from infectious or inflammatory etiology to traumatic or neoplastic processes, the vast majority of these symptoms derive from either a viral or bacterial source. The physician must narrow the differential, decide which clinical and laboratory data may be helpful, select the most appropriate management plan for the patient's symptoms and disease process, and prevent further complications. This chapter reviews the most common causes of pharyngitis, relevant available clinical information, appropriate laboratory tests, recommended treatment guidelines, possible complications, and general strategies for evaluating patients with acute pharyngitis.",

EBV is also associated with posterior cervical lymph adenopathy, splenomegaly, and a classic maculopa-pular rash that develops if patients receive penicillin-derived antibiotics. A patient presenting with primary HIV may complain of sore throat as well as several other flu-like symptoms, but they are likely to have HIV risk factors in their history (e.g., unprotected intercourse, multiple sexual partners, previous blood transfusion, and intravenous drug use).",

The clinical significance of an A. haemolyticum infection remains uncertain. Reported cases of Corynebacterium diphtheriae are very rare because of childhood vaccinations, but patients with this variety of pharyngitis will frequently complain of hoarseness and stridor caused by circulation of the diphtheria exotoxin, and may also experience cervical adenitis and edema. The defining characteristic of this bacteria is the development of a firmly adherent, gray, inflammatory pseudomembrane across the oropharynx.

Trauma or throat strain caused by overuse (shouting, for example) should be elicited via the patient's history of symptom onset. Neoplastic processes can be more subtle, but may have accompanying weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, or dysphagia. An abscess would likely cause higher fevers, more discomfort, and persistent symptoms despite typical first-line antibiotic treatment. Airway compromise, hoarseness, or neck swelling may accompany abscesses depending on their location. Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 3 years of age, and is defined by a number of well-documented features, including pharyngeal erythema, strawberry tongue, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, fever, cervical lymphaden-opathy, cracked red lips, and erythema and swelling of the hands and feet with desquamation of periungual regions several days after symptom onset.",

Nonsuppurative complications are reflective of streptococcal toxins, streptolysins, and inflammatory processes involving antibodies targeted at the bacteria.
