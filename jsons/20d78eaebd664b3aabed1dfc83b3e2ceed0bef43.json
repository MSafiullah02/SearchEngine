NEC occurs in 2-5% of all preterm infants although the majority of cases develop in infants less than 36 weeks of gestational age. It has been noted that infants born at earlier gestational age, develop NEC at a later chronological age. The average age of onset of disease is 20.2 days for infants born less than 30 weeks of gestation whereas disease onset is reduced to 13.8 days for infants born at 31-33 weeks and 5.4 days for infants born after 34 weeks of gestation.",

As such, the intrinsic function of this epithelial layer is to protect the host. The mucosal defence system can be divided into two categories: non-immunologic and immunologic defence mechanisms. Non-immunologic mechanisms include peristalsis, gastric acidity, prote-olytic enzyme activity, mucin production and semipermeable intestinal barrier function provided by tight junctions between the epithelial cells lining the gut. Peristalsis is the progressive wave of contraction and relaxation of the intestine. In full-term infants and adults, migrating motor complexes propagate these waves along the intestine. In humans migrating complexes are not present until approximately 34 weeks of gestation, which may contribute to intestinal stasis in premature infants, thereby altering the microbial ecosystem. Gastric acidity is thought to be a fi rst line defence against bacterial passage into the proximal intestine. The premature human infant's gastric pH is initially high and then decreases towards mature levels with increasing age and ultimately reaching a pH < 4. Permeability is an important factor in the ability of bacteria to translocate, causing systemic infection, and the premature infant intestine is more permeable in the fi rst 2 days of life. Mucus production provides a protective viscoelastic layer to the epithelial intestinal lining. In humans, mucus production and composition changes with age, and increases in response to bacterial challenge.",

A variety of bacterial and viral pathogens have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC including Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridia, coagulase negative Staphylococcus and several viral species (Table 44 .1). Despite the fact that no single organism appears to be responsible for NEC the importance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of disease should not be discounted. It is known that NEC does not develop in animal models kept in sterile environments. At birth the intestine is devoid of bacterial fl ora, but is rapidly colonized by bacteria from the rectovaginal fl ora of the mother, and bacteria from the surrounding environment. Additionally, colonization by commensal bacteria is required for the normal development and maturation of the newborn intestine. Bacterial-host cross talk has been shown to modulate gut vascular development, and promote immune system development. Abnormal intestinal colonization patterns of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit may further increase susceptibility to NEC.",

A prospective multicenter study of preterm infants found almost a tenfold increase in the incidence of NEC in formulafed infants as compared with those who were fed breast-milk. The positive effects of breast milk are likely due to a variety of potential anti-microbial products including immunoglobulins, oligosaccharides, lactoferrin and glycoproteins with anti-adhesive capacity for bacteria, and cytokines present in breast milk.

Elevated plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 have been found in infants with NEC, and local upregulation of IL-1, IL-8 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) has been demonstrated in the intestine of infants with NEC. Nitric oxide plays a paradoxical role in the pathogenesis of NEC. Constitutive low-level production of NO enhances mucosal blood fl ow, and promotes local vascular health. However, sustained overproduction of NO due to upregulation of iNOS leads to intestinal damage. The pathologic effects of NO are postulated to be due to the strong oxidant effects of peroxynitrate (ONOO -) resulting in enterocyte cell death, and impaired mucosal healing. ONOOcauses enterocyte cell death and impairs mucosal healing. The up-regulation of NO has been demonstrated in areas of intestinal epithelial injury in human infants with NEC.

            "text": "At birth, the intestine lacks bacterial fl ora, and with time becomes colonized with a variety of bacterial species. As previously mentioned, the microbial fl ora in the premature hospitalized patient is different from that of a healthy full-term infant. Typically, full-term infants have a predominance of favourable grampositive organisms including Lactobacilli and Bifi dobacteria, whereas premature infants are largely colonized by Enterococcus and gram negative organisms. The administration of exogenous probiotics may protect against NEC by altering the intestinal ecosystem from colonization by potentially harmful microfl ora to a more favourable or benefi cial environment. Clinical trials investigating the potential benefi t of probiotics have produced mixed results. A randomised prospective study by Bin-num et al found an absolute risk reduction of 12% in the incidence of NEC, and a decline in disease severity after daily feeding supplementation with probiotics. In a prospective study by Lin et al the overall patient mortality was lower after probiotic administration, with a lower incidence of NEC following probiotic therapy (1.1% vs. 5.3%). However, a similarly designed study revealed no benefi t. Currently the role of probiotic therapy remains an area of investigation.",

            "text": "Despite appropriate and timely medical management, over a third of patients with NEC require surgical intervention. In infants with a birth weight greater than 1,500 g laporotomy with resection of affected intestine is the preferred approach. In some cases the intestine is necrotic in only a single segment; while in others, the disease pattern is more complex involving multiple segments with intervening areas of questionable viability, or the entire extent of the small and large bowel (Fig. 44.2) . The standard of care is to remove all necrotic areas, taking great care to preserve any bowel that appears viable. After resecting the necrotic regions, an area of viable intestine is used to create an ostomy with or without a mucus fi stula. There are occasional reports of resection of isolated perforation with primary reanastomosis of the remaining intestine, however this is not a widely accepted approach. In patients who are found to have multiple areas of questionable intestinal viability, a \"secondlook\" procedure may be planned to revaluate the bowel in 24-36 h prior to the formation of an enterostomy. In the past, if at the time of surgery many segments of intestine were found to be involved, the creation of multiple stomas was typically practiced. However, this strategy may result in the sacrifi ce of potentially viable intestine, hence some surgeons advocate the \"patch, drain and wait\" approach. In this case each perforation is sutured closed, penrose drains are placed and parenteral support is continued. In cases of pan-necrosis surgical therapy is often associated with extremely poor outcomes and intervention may be foregone.",

Laparotomy with intestinal resection in very-low-birth weight infants is associated with a very high morbidity and mortality, and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Ein et al in 1977 reported a series of extremely low birth weight patients treated with a peritoneal-drainage procedure. They reported that three survived, two of which did not require a subsequent operation. It was postulated that peritoneal drainage allowed a release of intra-abdominal pressure, drainage of infection, and time for further medical optimisation and stabilisation. Despite remaining somewhat controversial, this approach was adopted for years by many surgeons as both a temporising measure and a defi nitive therapeutic approach to Bell stage III disease in extremely low birth weight patients. Moss et al. published a multiinstitutional, randomised, controlled trial in 2006, comparing primary peritoneal drainage with laparotomy and bowel resection in infants less than 1,500 g. They found no statistical difference in survival, dependence on parenteral nutrition or length of hospital stay. Hence, while peritoneal drainage may have an important role in the surgical management of extremely low birth weight infants, careful individual assessment of each patient and consultation between medical and surgical personnel is required for determining an optimal treatment strategy.",

However, some patients who initially appear to respond well to medical management develop gastric residuals associated with abdominal distension and bilious emesis upon resuming enteral feedings. This scenario is suggestive of the presence of intestinal strictures, which form in areas of partial intestinal necrosis or ischemia with healing, causing tissue contraction and scarring. The most commonly affected site is at the junction of the descending and sigmoid colon. Radiographic imaging may confi rm bowel obstruction, with a transition zone and airfl uid levels. If a stricture is suspected a contrast enema (or an upper gastrointestinal study) should be performed to assess intestinal patency. If a stricture is demonstrated, surgical resection is indicated at this time. Intestinal strictures develop in approximately one third of patients with a history of NEC.",
