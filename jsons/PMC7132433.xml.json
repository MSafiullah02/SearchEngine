He described the appearance of a new disease on some English swine farms, characterized by acute watery diarrhea in feeder pigs, fatteners and sows while suckling pigs were not affected. The syndrome was called TOO, standing for \u201cThe Other One\u201d or also \u201cTGE2\u201d and both these denominations referred to its clinical similarity to TGE, a common cause of viral diarrhea in pigs in Europe at that time. An important difference with TGE was, however, that neonatal pigs were not affected. Since these denominations were considered unsatisfactory from a scientific point of view, the name of the new syndrome was quickly changed to \u201cEpidemic Diarrhea-ED\u201d.",

Suckling piglets were not affected but pigs of 10 weeks and older and also adults showed an acute diarrhea lasting one week. The outbreak lasted 3\u20134 weeks on the farm. During the autumn of 1971 and also the following winter, several new outbreaks were reported. A clinical diagnosis and possibility for differentiation from TGE was thus based on the high morbidity in fatteners and adult animals in the absence of disease in neonatal and freshly weaned pigs. In most of these diarrheal cases, TGEV was excluded by laboratory examination. The fact that ED was observed on farms with a recent history of a TGE outbreak, and thus in TGEV immune animals, increased the conviction that TGEV was not involved. During 1972, ED spread rapidly between pig farms, particulary fattening herds. Mortality was rare and the effect of an outbreak was estimated at about 2 weeks feed cost.",

This new disease now resembled TGE more closely than ED did, but TGEV was again excluded using direct immunofluorescence on intestines and applying established serological techniques available for detection of anti-TGEV antibodies. Now, a differentiation with TGE on a clinical basis only became difficult, often impossible. This new syndrome was called ED2 to differentiate it from the 1971 ED1 where no baby pigs were involved. ED2 was economically much more important than ED1.",

Soon after the isolation of this new coronavirus, extensive pathogenesis studies were performed in colostrum deprived pigs with one of the Belgian isolates, designated coronavirus CV777, (isolated in month 7 of 1977) which became the prototype strain for PEDV in Europe (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980, Debouck et al., 1981).

Experience gathered from research with TGEV helped much in the approach to study this new enteric disease. Lack of success to cultivate the virus in cell cultures forced to produce clean virus stocks by oral inoculation of colostrum deprived pigs, performing surgery 18 h later and rinsing the in vivo produced virus from the lumen of the infected small intestines during 12 h while keeping the pig in the incubator (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980). Such \u201cclean\u201d pig adapted virus stocks served for experimental pig inoculation experiments and to produce an hyperimmune serum for the preparation of a conjugate for an immunofluorescence (IF) conjugate to detect the virus in tissues. Serological tests were developed to detect antibodies by ELISA (Callebaut et al., 1982) and to study possible relationship with other coronaviruses by immuno-electron microscopy (Pensaert et al., 1981). Genome analysis of the PED isolate(s) was not available at that time.",

A crucial question was whether or not the ED1 agent and ED2/PEDV were related or whether ED2/PEDV was totally new. Infectious material containing the ED1 agent from earlier outbreaks was not available. A retrospective serological survey was carried out on sow sera that had been collected in slaughterhouses in Belgium starting in 1969 and thus prior to the emergence of ED1 in 1972 on the European continent. Antibodies to PEDV were not found in sera collected in 1969 but were present in 7% of the sows collected in 1971, in 42% of the sows in 1975 and in 32% of the sows in 1980. These results indicated that the coronavirus PED had been responsible for first ED1 outbreaks, for the ED2 outbreaks and thus it can be accepted that PEDV emerged in 1971 but later widened its host tropism from growing and adult swine towards neonatal pigs. This finding was interesting from an evolutionary point of view.",

But even after the emergence of ED2/PEDV, some outbreaks on breeding-finishing farms still did not involve neonatal pigs. While it was assumed that both ED1 and PEDV were co-circulating in the swine population, it is also possible that some farms had experienced an earlier ED1 infection and that immune sows protected their offspring against PEDV by lactogenic immunity while groups of fattening pigs had become susceptible. It must, however, be mentioned that cross-protection between ED1 and PEDV has never been studied. Also, after a first epidemic phase of the new PEDV, the virus often persisted on breeding-finishing farms in weaned and feeder pigs (endemic PED). The sow population was immune, protecting its offspring, while feeder pigs became susceptible after loosing their maternal protection. The highly variable and mixed clinical picture was, at that time, ascribed to the possible co-circulation of the original ED1 agent and its presumed variant PEDV in the population.

It is interesting to mention that, similar to PEDV, several of the other alphacoronaviruses, including the human 229E, TGEV, PRCV, CCoV, FECV and FIPV use the cellular receptor aminopeptidase N (APN) for virus entry into cells in their host (Weiss and Navas-Martin., 2005) and this seems to be a common evolutionary characteristic. Still, the genetic and antigenic diversity between PEDV and the other alphacoronaviruses is very largeAlso, no cross-reactivity has been reported between PEDV and the coronaviruses belonging to the beta, gamma or delta genera.The genomic data presented above and the use of the same cellular receptor suggest a common origin of some of some of these alphacoronaviruses.

CV777 virus infection in the villous enterocytes in neonatal pigs caused rapid cell desquamation throughout the small intestine within 24\u201336 h after inoculation which was somewhat slower than observed with TGEV. Still, the villous atrophy induced by PEDV was so abrupt and extensive that rapid and severe dehydration occurred leading to death in neonatal pigs. Due to this similarity in pathogenesis with TGEV, much of the scientific knowledge acquired on TGE diagnosis, \u2212immunity, \u2212prevention could be almost invariably applied to PED. An apparent difference with TGEV, probably of minor importance from a clinical point of view, was that epithelial cells on colonic villi were also infected but desquamation was not observed. Still now, it is a question if this colonic site of replication contributes to disease severity. PED diarrhea in fatteners and sows is often accompanied by an apparent belly ache, a clinical sign not seen with TGE, and the question arises if the colon infection may contribute to this clinical manifestation.",

            "text": "A point of debate in the PEDV evolution, particularly since its occurrence in Asia and its emergence the USA, is the arising of PEDV genetic variants influencing virulence. The history in Europe, here presented, allows to assume that ED2/PEDV was a variant of ED1 which had acquired tropism for intestinal enterocytes in neonatal pigs. This new tropism expanded and increased the virus virulence since a vulnerable age became affected and piglets mortality became an important economic aspect of the disease. Currently, two major PEDV variants are described in the USA upon routine genome analyses of USA isolates. The first, also called \u201coriginal US PEDV \u201d, appears to be \u201chighly virulent\u201d while the second, the so called S-INDEL strains, standing for INsertions and DELetions in the S gene of the virus, are associated with mild(er) clinical outbreaks. Similar genotypic variants have been detected in Asia, the S-INDELs already before 2010 and the highly virulent since 2010. When adopting this genomic identification, it appears that CV777 is classified as a S-INDEL isolate apparently belonging to a different cluster compared to the US INDELs (Carvajal et al., 2015). Considering the pathogenesis and virulence of the European prototype strain CV777 of the seventies as evaluated by the sites and degree of replication and the degree of villous atrophy, no real difference exists with the more recent highly virulent (original US PEDV) isolates from the USA. For example, the pig adapted C777 when experimentally inoculated in neonatal piglets, caused villous atrophy with villous length reduction from the normal value of 700\u2013900 \u03bcm to as low as 200\u2013300 \u03bcm throughout the small intestine and within 6\u201336 h after the start of the diarrhea (Debouck et al., 1981, Coussement et al., 1982).",

The severity of clinical signs and the mortality of the pigs varied between the 4 liters (from 0% to 75%). Severe clinical signs were observed in 2 of the 4 litters. Two of the 4 sows developed diarrhea. It was observed that, despite similar background of sows and environment in this experiment, the severity of disease was rather variable.

In the same experiment mentioned above (Chun-Ming et al., 2015), one litter was also inoculated with an original US PEDV strain of high virulence. It was concluded that virulence of the S-INDEL isolate was generally lower based on the longer incubation period, the shorter duration of diarrhea, more limited regions of virus infection, overall lower pig mortality (18% vs 55% for \u201coriginal\u201d) and some other additional parameters.",

The result of a PED outbreak will be much more difficult to predict, to evaluate and to define since, next to possible virulence differences of the isolates and next to variation among litters in suckling pigs, many additional factors play a role in determining the clinical outcome of the infection. They include immune status of sows, dose of virus exposure on the farm, herd size and pig farming management and others, all of which may be interacting in a different way. Moreover, the procedures applied for intentional infection (feed back) of the sow population to speed up the induction of immunity to be passively transfered to the litter could be considered as a potential cause of worsening of the clinical status of the suckling pigs. In fact, that practice can also be a source of other pathogens for gilts/sows and/or for newborn piglets. It is thus possible that, particularly in a fully susceptible pig population and even with PEDV strains of similar virulence, the mortality rates and losses are much higher in some continents or regions or farms with extensive and highly industrialised pig farming.

PEDV outbreaks in the late seventies and early eighties occurred both on breeding and fattening swine farms. Acute outbreaks with neonatal pig mortality were encountered in the breeding-fattening farms which became infected for the first time. PEDV often became endemic. In farrowing-finishing farms, successive groups of pigs became infected upon weaning and after losing their lactogenic protection from their immune mothers, so that the virus could persist. Whether the virus persisted or not after the original outbreak was somewhat unpredictable, as it could also disappear from the farm. The farm size (number of sows) and its structure (number of units) played a role. Also PED persistence regularly occurred in fattening farms using the system of continuous introduction of feeder pigs originating from numerous and different breeders. A typical case of persistent diarrhea caused by PEDV lasting 10 months on a breeding-finishing farm was described in the Netherlands (Pijpers et al.,1993) and this was a feature regularly observed in Europe in the eighties. Recent experience in the USA (2013\u20132015), has shown that management practices adopted in the epidemic phase of the infection can turn PED to a endemic/enzootic and long lasting form (Jung and Saif, 2015).",

It occurred between May 2005 and June 2006 in an area densely populated with pigs. The outbreak started with four cases occurring in fattening farms from May to July. No clinical cases were detected during August and September. In October, two new cases appeared: the first in a fattening unit and the second in the nursery of a three-site production unit. The disease spread during the winter of 2005\u20132006, affecting more than 60 farms including fattening units as well as farrow-to-finish or farrow-to-weaner farms. Some PEDV positive farms were still detected between mid-2006 and the end of 2007, but the disease progressively disappeared (Sozzi et al., 2014). From 2008\u20132014, only sporadic outbreaks were observed in grower and finisher herds (EFSA, 2014). This epidemic in Italy in 2006\u20132007 inclined us to forecast a new episode of PED epidemics in Europe but it did not occur.",

When sequenced, they were classified as S-INDEL strains, and the German isolate showed 99.4% identity to the OH851 strain isolated in the USA in January 2014 (Vlasova et al., 2014). The size and clinical disease in these outbreaks were very variable. The outbreak involved in Belgium: 1 fattening farm (no mortality), in France: 1 farrow to finish farm (mortality 12% in pigs at one week and 25% at weaning), in Germany: 4 farms (2 fattening with 1.5% and 2% mortality, 2 breeding with 70% and no mortality, respectively) and in Portugal where it started in one farm (with pig mortality, but not further defined) and where the virus spread to 43 other pig farms during a period of 3 months. From these data, it can be seen that, again, there was much and unexplained variation in PED clinical disease and outcome. Except for the possibility of the outbreak in Ukraine, it is very doubtful that the other European isolates have anything to do with those involved in the US epidemic. Similar focal cases must have occurred in Europe before the US outbreak but were, most likely, neither recognized nor diagnosed nor reported as PED. S-INDEL strains have been present in Europe as CV777 appears to be the earliest known representative (Carvajal et al., 2015).",

As previously explained, once an outbreak has occurred on a breeding farm, PEDV virus could persist easily when successive litters of pigs, after losing their lactogenic protection at weaning, become a susceptible target for infection. In fact, persistence for a virus such as PEDV would be almost as a \u201cnatural\u201d feature similar to the endemic character observed with other porcine enzootic enteric viruses such as swine rotaviruses, swine enteroviruses and others. TGEV cannot serve as an example here because, in Europe, it has largely been eliminated from the swine population due to the emergence, in the early eighties, of the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is a TGEV deletion mutant which has acquired respiratory tropism and shows an epidemiological advantage of rapid aerogenic spreading while causing a protective immunity to TGEV. Endemic PRCV has thus \u201creplaced\u201d TGEV in Europe.",

Could it be that the virus has a non swine ancestor which has temporarily become adapted to swine but which is not really swine-borne? Such evolution would not be unique for animal coronaviruses. Could it be that the virus can maintain itself in the population only when present at a sufficient high dose allowing it to continue the infection chain but once reaching a low level quantity,e.g on a farm basis, is not longer able to do so? The waning of PEDV has apparently not occurred in parts of Asia within its 2\u20133 decennia of presence on that continent to the same degree as it did in Europe, and it will be intriguing to closely follow the epidemiological course and evolution of PEDV in the USA, once the epidemic phase has passed.",
