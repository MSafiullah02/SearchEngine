Its plus-strand RNA genome consists of 27,553 nucleotides and a poly-A tail. At variance with typical group 1 coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 has an additional 179-amino acid residue domain in the Sprotein and only one open reading frame (ORF) instead of two between the S and the E gene. 1 Very recently, it was found that the HCoV-NL63 spike-protein binds to the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) but not to CD13 as other group I coronaviruses. 2 The genome of all known coronaviruses contains two ORFs that encode nonstructural proteins, and these are followed by the genes encoding the four structural proteins. Nonstructural proteins play an essential role in the replication and transcription of the virus genome as well as in polyprotein processing. Elucidating their structures and functions will pave the way for anticoronaviral drug discovery. 3,4",

Expression was induced at OD 660nm = 0.4 by adding 1 mM IPTG. For test expression of the generated constructs, cells were harvested by centrifugation after 6 hours of incubation either at 37\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.
