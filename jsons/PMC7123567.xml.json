Some diseases, such as measles, sleeping sickness, and bubonic plague, emerged in prehistoric or ancient times (Babbott and Gordon 1954; Hays 2005; Steverding 2008), whereas others, such as Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and SARS, emerged more recently (World Health Organization 1978; Chua et al. 2000; Guan et al. 2003). The trend of EID emergence is accelerating: over 300 distinct emerging disease events have been recorded in the last six decades and more than 35 new infectious diseases have emerged in humans since 1980 (Lederberg et al. 2003; Jones et al. 2008).",

Although many zoonotic pathogen spillovers arise in domestic animals, including livestock, the majority (71.8 %) of zoonotic EIDs arise from wildlife species (Jones et al. 2008). In many developing countries, domesticated animals live in close proximity to wildlife. This facilitates the movement of pathogens between them and to humans through interactions with sylvatic disease cycles or through two-step wildlife-to-domestic animal-to-human emergences. Examples include rabies infections, which move between wildlife and domestic dogs, with recurring spillovers to humans; and the Henipah viruses, in which Pteropus flying foxes are the reservoir host and domestic pigs or horses are amplifier hosts from which spillovers to humans have been documented (Childs et al. 2007; Daszak et al. 2007). Not surprisingly, the most devastating pandemics in human history, the Black Death, Spanish influenza, and HIV/AIDS, were all caused by zoonoses from wildlife (Morens et al. 2008).",

Most pathogens infecting animals fail to make the jump into humans, but 33 % of zoonotic pathogens (~286 out of 868 zoonotic pathogen species studied) that have spilled over are known to be transmissible between humans (Taylor et al. 2001).

Although additional research on the relationship between habitat degradation and EIDs is needed, Gottdenker et al. (2014) reviewed 305 studies incorporating a broad variety of diseases and found that the most common land use change types related to zoonotic disease transmission were deforestation, habitat fragmentation, agricultural development, irrigation, and urbanization. Functionally, the mechanisms influencing disease spillover include disruption of food web structures, changes in host\u2013pathogen interactions, and mixing of pathogen gene pools resulting in increased pathogen genetic diversity (Jones et al. 2013). Many studies have shown that habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss correspond to an increase in disease and pathogen abundance and diversity within a host species (Allan et al. 2003; Gillespie et al. 2005; Keesing et al. 2006; Salzer et al. 2007; Cottontail et al. 2009; Young et al. 2014). Specifically, the emergence or re-emergence of many zoonotic diseases including yellow fever, Lyme disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Nipah virus encephalitis, influenza, rabies, malaria, and human African trypanosomiasis have been linked to anthropogenic habitat changes (Jones et al. 2013).",

Pathogen spillover from bushmeat can occur through consumption; however, the main risks are associated with exposure to body fluids and feces during handling and butchering (Kilonzo et al. 2014; Paige et al. 2014). Historically, when a spillover occurred, the likelihood of an epidemic was limited because hunter-gatherer tribes were generally small and widely dispersed, hampering disease transmission between groups of people. Once agricultural expansion occurred, human population densities increased, and people became better connected, diseases could spread more easily. As a result, transmissions of infectious diseases from animals to humans have led to devastating outcomes across the globe (LeBreton et al. 2006). EIDs cause hundreds of thousands of deaths annually (Bogich et al. 2012). Some outbreaks have spread across large regions and became pandemics, costing the global economy tens of billions of dollars (e.g., SARS, H5N1, the 2014\u20132015 West African Ebola outbreak) and bringing entire nations to the brink of economic collapse.",

The recent Ebola outbreaks have highlighted the potential role of bushmeat as a source of pathogens, but a comprehensive review of the different pathogens that may emerge from wildlife through bushmeat-related activities is lacking. Although we are in no way suggesting that this issue is more important than other pressing health crises in sub-Saharan Africa (such as malaria prevention/treatment and improving healthcare infrastructure), we argue that a better assessment of the public health threats associated with this human-wildlife interaction is warranted and necessary to improve management of future disease outbreaks.",

Bushmeat is an important source of animal protein in many West and Central African countries, with up to 90 % of total animal protein consumption coming from wild animals (Fa et al. 2003). Overall, the contribution of bushmeat to protein and food security is generally lower in urban than rural areas and is highest among remote rural communities (Brashares et al. 2011). For example, the relative importance of bushmeat in the diet of rural Gabonese households ranged from 13 % of total household consumption value in a village near a town to 25 % in a remote community (Starkey 2004). Similarly, for rural Equatorial Guinea, Allebone-Webb (2008) showed that bushmeat consumption contributed 43 % to total protein consumption in a village with poor transport links, but only 18 % in a village with good connections. In remote Cameroonian communities with very few opportunities for purchasing alternative protein sources, bushmeat comprised 80\u201398 % of animal protein consumption (Muchaal and Ngandjui 1999). In rural communities with relatively good market access and low levels of bushmeat consumption, the importance of bushmeat for food has been shown to increase seasonally during the agricultural lean season (e.g. the planting season between harvests) when farming households receive little income (Dei 1989, de Merode et al. 2004, Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al. 2013b) and during the dry season when fish is not available (Poulsen et al. 2009). Bushmeat is also an important source of nutrients, especially among children. Evidence from rural Madagascar shows that removing bushmeat consumption would result in a 29 % increase in the number of children suffering from anemia and triple the cases of anemia among children in the poorest households (Golden et al. 2011).",

In rural Gabon, hunting accounts for up to 72 % of household incomes, with the proportion rising in poorer, more remote communities (Starkey 2004). Hunters are also more likely to sell large animals and keep small animals for their own consumption, because the latter fetch a lower price per animal and may be less marketable (van Vliet and Nasi 2008). Finally, households facing income shortages during the agricultural lean season and requiring cash income to pay for urgent expenditures, such as hospital bills, are more likely to sell bushmeat than keep it for own consumption (de Merode et al. 2004).",

            "text": "The sale of bushmeat historically occurred at a local level, but with increased transportation routes and globalization, the bushmeat trade is expanding to supply urban and international demand. In the past, novel pathogens entering the rural communities may not have spread beyond the community, but this is no longer the case as remote rural areas are connected to urban areas, and increased global trade networks and air travel increases the risk of disease transmission worldwide (Brashares et al. 2011). This expanding trade network links hunters to consumers, and with many people along this commodity chain coming into contact with bushmeat, the opportunity for disease spillover can occur at many points. For example, the commodity chain supplying bushmeat to an urban market in Ghana includes hunters, wholesalers, market traders, restaurant owners, and consumers (Mendelson et al. 2003). The bushmeat commodity chain supplying an urban market in Democratic Republic of the Congo is comprised of hunters, porters who carry the meat to the road, the bicycle traders who transport the meat into town, and the market-stall owners who sell the bushmeat to consumers (de Merode and Cowlishaw 2006). A recent study from Ghana estimates that a minimum of 128,000 bats are sold each year through a commodity chain that stretches up to 400 km and involves multiple vendors (Kamins et al. 2011a). In Zambia, Mozambique, and Malawi, well-developed and complex rural-urban trade supply networks link rural hunters to urban consumers who are willing to pay high prices for bushmeat (Barnett 1997). Understanding commodity chains is important, as pathogens likely remain viable for some period after an animal is killed. For example, Prescott et al. (2015) demonstrated that Ebola virus remains viable on monkey carcasses for at least seven days, with viral RNA detectable for 10 weeks.",

            "text": "However, it is important to recognize that our understanding of the scale of bushmeat harvest is limited by the availability of information and hence current regional harvest estimates might underestimate actual harvest volumes. Despite substantial effort in recent years, our knowledge is still site-specific and data are lacking from many regions. Most surveys have been restricted to relatively small areas or market catchments from which national estimates were extrapolated. Research efforts have focused on Central Africa with some data available for 60 % of countries compared to 30 % of West African countries (Taylor et al. 2015). A large number of sites with detailed bushmeat data are concentrated in the Cross-Sanaga region of Nigeria and Cameroon, where Fa et al. (2006) collected market data at 86 sites, hence presenting a geographical bias in our understanding of bushmeat harvest. Furthermore, the majority of available data samples (79.3 % and 53.6 %, in West and Central Africa, respectively) identified by Taylor et al. (2015) come from market surveys with poorly defined catchment areas, compared to offtake and consumption surveys. Strong variation between individual estimates highlights the problems with extrapolation of survey data to national or regional levels and the effects of sampling strategies (hunter versus market surveys), timing of survey (open season versus lean season), survey location, and extrapolation methods. Individual figures should therefore be treated with caution, but the overall message remains: bushmeat is harvested at an enormous scale exposing those involved in the bushmeat commodity chain to zoonotic diseases.",

For example, after the construction of 140 km of logging roads in northern Congo, the average time for a hunting trip was reduced from 12 to 2 hours (Wilkie et al. 2001). Development of rural businesses, such as timber companies, attracts workers and their families to remote locations, increasing bushmeat demand, especially when no hunting regulations are in place and alternative protein sources are not provided (Auzel and Wilkie 2000; Bennett and Gumal 2001; Poulsen et al. 2009). The effect of logging company presence on hunting pressure was documented in Gabon where ape populations decreased 50 % between 1983 and 2000 as a result of hunting (Walsh et al. 2003). In addition, agricultural expansion and mining have exerted a strong force in changing the African landscape and influencing human migration patterns (Norris et al. 2010). Due to increased access, people are brought into closer contact with wildlife, which facilitates accessibility to bushmeat hunting and makes transportation of bushmeat from rural to urban areas easier and more cost-effective (Wolfe et al. 2005a).",

They are the most abundant form of life on earth; many viruses are recognized as important disease-causing agents, and they are subject to frequent mutation and thus evolution. The advent of modern molecular techniqueshas advanced our understanding of viral diversity and pathogenesis in both animal and human hosts. For example, in relation to bushmeat, it is now clear that many virus variants are present in hunted nonhuman primate species, which have received most of the research attention, and that these variants have crossed between nonhuman primates and humans on multiple occasions (Peeters and Delaporte 2012; Table 24.1). Bats and rodentsare also major zoonotic virus carriers (Meerburg et al. 2009; Baker et al. 2013); other taxonomic groups are less studied, at least in sub-Saharan Africa. Several sub-Saharan African viruses of importance are vector-borne, including Rift Valley Fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. While one presumes that this would make them unlikely to spread via bushmeat-related activities, the possibility remains that animal handling could present a risk (Magwedere et al. 2012). However, no significant links between vector-borne viruses and bushmeat hunting have been made, and we will not include a discussion of these viruses here.",

While the origin of HIV was long obscured, Human HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have evolved from strains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (Hahn et al. 2000; Lemey et al. 2003; Van Heuverswyn and Peeters 2007; Sharp and Hahn 2010; Peeters and Delaporte 2012; Peeters et al. 2013; Kazanji et al. 2015). Evidence suggests that SIV crossed over to humans by blood contact when hunters had an exposed open wound or injured themselves during the butchering of nonhuman primates (Hahn et al. 2000; Wolfe et al. 2004a, b; Karesh and Noble 2009). The closest relatives of HIV-1 found among nonhuman primates are SIVcpz and SIVgor, from common chimpanzees and western gorillas in west central Africa (Gao et al. 1999; Sharp et al. 2005; Keele et al. 2006; Van Heuverswyn et al. 2006, 2007; Takehisa et al. 2009) and at least four separate spillovers have occurred (Peeters et al. 2013). HIV-2 is derived from SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) in West Africa (Apetrei et al. 2005; Hirsch et al. 1989; Gao et al. 1992; Ayouba et al. 2013), where high viral genetic diversity exists and where transmission is believed to have occurred at least eight times.",

They documented low overall prevalence of SIV (only 2.93 % of carcasses), with the lowest prevalence found among the most common species in the market. However, they did find SIVvariants in about 70 % of the tested primate species. In total, serological evidence of SIV infection has been documented for at least 40 different primate species (Aghokeng et al. 2010; Li\u00e9geois et al. 2011, 2012). Cross-species transmission of strains and co-infection with more than one strain have been documented, sometimes followed by genetic recombination (Hahn et al. 2000; Bibollet-Ruche et al. 2004; Aghokeng et al. 2007; Gogarten et al. 2014), a recipe for future spillovers into humans (Locatelli and Peeters 2012).",

Like the other retroviruses discussed above (HIV and HTLV), SFV is genetically diverse and relatively host species-specific. In Cameroon, Wolfe et al.

These pathogens are periodically emerging viruses, typically from single spillover events, which cause hemorrhagic fevers (reviewed by Olival and Hayman 2014; Rougeron et al. 2015 (but note that Rougeron\u2019s listing for a single case of SUDV in Sudan in 2011 is erroneous)). The 2014\u20132015 West Africa outbreak of EBOV is still ongoing at the time of this writing (Labouba and Leroy 2015). While the zoonotic source of this outbreak is unknown, three initial outbreaks of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1976 to 1979 involved victims who were reported to have handled western gorilla or common chimpanzee carcasses or to have had physical contact with people who touched the animals (Leroy et al. 2004a, b). Similarly, Marburgvirus was first identified in laboratory workers who had dissected imported grivet (Chlorocebus aethiops) (Martini et al. 1968; Siegert et al. 1968). Both western gorillas and common chimpanzees have suffered significant mortality from filovirus outbreaks (Walsh et al. 2003; Leroy et al. 2004a, b; Bermejo et al. 2006; Rizkalla et al. 2007) and antibodies to EBOV were documented in several other primate species by Leroy et al. (2004b). The single case of TAFV occurred in an ethnologist likely infected while performing a necropsy of a dead common chimpanzee following a rash of common chimpanzee deaths in the Tai National Park in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Le Guenno et al. 1995; Wyers et al. 1999). Beyond primates, other incidental hosts in the wild are possible, as was demonstrated for duikers (Cephalophus spp.) (Leroy et al. 2004a; Rouquet et al. 2005). As reviewed by Weingartl et al. (2013), both dogs (naturally) and pigs (at least experimentally) can also be infected. During the 2001\u20132002 EBOV outbreak in Gabon, Allela et al. (2005) found over 30 % seroprevalence in dogs living in villages with EBOV human and animal cases. Those dogs appeared to be asymptomatic and were presumed to be exposed by scavenging wild animals.",

            "text": "Although incidental hosts likely play important roles in the ecology of these viruses, especially when moribund or dead animals are consumed, strong evidence suggests that bats are thenatural reservoir hosts for at least Marburgvirus and EBOV. For Marburgvirus, the cave dwelling and densely packed Egyptian rousette fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is now well-documented as areservoir host (Towner et al. 2009; Amman et al. 2012), but antibodies against the virus and/or the presence of viral RNA have been found in several other species (see Table 24.1). The strong association of Marburgvirus with the Egyptian rousette makes sense in light of the outbreaks of this virus in people visiting tourist caves or working in mines (Adjemian et al. 2011; Timen et al. 2009; Towner et al. 2009; Amman et al. 2012). The picture for EBOV is less clear, but evidence of infection has been found in at least eight sub-Saharan bat species (Pourrut et al. 2007, 2009; Hayman et al. 2010, 2012; Table 24.1). Of the ten bat species listed in Table 24.1 for Marburgvirus and EBOV, seven are fruit bats, which are relatively larger and more visible, and thus targets of bushmeat hunters. That said, bushmeat hunting of these bats is not ubiquitous throughout their range and cannot solely explain filovirus spillovers. Mari Sa\u00e9z et al. (2015) unconvincingly suggested the non-fruit bat, Mops condylurus, might have been the source of the 2014\u20132015 West African Ebola outbreak. Pourrut et al. (2009) found evidence of antibodies against ZEBOV in this species, but there is no real evidence that this free-tailed bat played a role in the 2014\u20132015 outbreak.

However, recent studies have identified Henipavirus and Henipa-like viruses in sub-Saharan African fruit bats, which are a phylogenetically distinct clade of pteropodid bats that do not overlap distributionally with any Pteropus species. Documentation of Henipavirus and related RNA (Drexler et al. 2009; Muleya et al. 2014; Baker et al. 2012) and anti-Henipavirus antibodies (Hayman et al. 2008; Pernet et al. 2014) in the African straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) clearly show that this deadly and diverse viral group is present in sub-Saharan Africa. This bat species is a frequent target of hunters and a significant protein source where it is found (Kamins et al. 2011b). Weiss et al. (2012) documented the presence of this group of viruses in these bats found live in bushmeat markets. Strong evidence of spillover to humans was documented by Pernet et al. (2014) who found antibodies against HNVs in human samples from Cameroon. These seropositive human samples were found almost exclusively in individuals who reported butchering these bats. This bat is also a long-distance migrator with significant panmixia across the continent, which could facilitate viral transmission between bats (Peel et al. 2013).",

(2012) found that the Henipavirus lineage originated in Africa and identified bats as the likely origin of this large family of viruses. A precautionary tale from sub-Saharan Africa comes from the recent discovery and naming of the Sosuga virus from a wildlife researcher who became very ill after handling and dissecting hundreds of bats and rodents in Uganda and South Sudan (Albari\u00f1o et al. 2014). This virus is most closely related to Tuhoko virus 3, a rubula-like virus recently isolated from the Leschenault\u2019s Rousette fruit bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) in southern China. Amman et al. (2015) subsequently found Sosuga virus in R. aegyptiacus captured from multiple locations in Uganda; the researcher infected by this virus handled this species extensively in her studies.",

            "text": "\nRabies and Other Lyssaviruses: Rabies is\ntheoldest known zoonotic EID, recorded as early as the twenty-third century BC (Steele and Fernandez 1991). An estimated 25,000 people die in Africa each year from rabies (Dodet et al. 2015), some portion of which may be from exposure that occurs in bushmeat-related activities, although most human cases can be attributed to domestic dogs. Rabies virus (RABV) is in the Lyssavirus genus. It is joined in Africa by at least five additional species: Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), and the newly proposed Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV). These viruses have bat(s) astheir reservoir host (Banyard et al. 2014) with two exceptions. The Mokola virus is found in shrews (Crocidura spp.), rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi; Saluzzo et al. 1984), and companion animals (Delmas et al. 2008; Kgaladi et al. 2013). The Ikoma virus has thus far only been documented in African civets (Civettictis civetta; Table 24.1, Marston et al. 2012). A variety of wildlife species can be secondary hosts of rabies (e.g., in Botswana, see Moagabo et al. 2009) and rabies has been documented to occur in a number of nonhuman primate species, including those encountered in the bushmeat trade (Gautret et al. 2014). Lyssaviruses are found worldwide, but the greatest genetic diversity is in Africa and Lagos bat virus may be more than one species (Delmas et al. 2008; Markotter et al. 2008; Kuzmin et al. 2010a). While most human cases are due to rabies virus, Duvenhage virus has been documented in human fatalities associated with bat scratches that likely transmitted the virus (van Thiel et al. 2009; Paweska et al. 2006). Mokolo virus has been detected in two human cases without mortality (Kgaladi et al. 2013).",

The first case of human monkeypox was identified in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with subsequent outbreaks in Liberia, Sierra Leone, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (reviewed by Reynolds et al. 2010; Rimoin et al. 2010). Recent MPX increases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere have been attributed to cessation of the human smallpox vaccine, which conferred some immunity to other pox viruses (Rimoin et al. 2010). Human and nonhuman primate infections are suspected to result from wildlife exposure such as would occur in bushmeat-related activities; infected species include squirrels (e.g., Thomas\u2019s rope squirrel, Funisciurus anerythrus; Khodakevich et al. 1986; African ground squirrels; Xerus sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010), dormice (Graphiurus sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010), and giant pouched rats (Cricetomys sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010). The outbreak that occurred in the USA in 2007 after exposure to rodents in the illegal pet trade also linked human monkeypox to rope squirrels, dormice, and pouched rats (Hutson et al. 2007). While dormice are small and not likely to be the target of hunting, the diurnal and highly visible squirrels and the\ngiant pouched rats are routinely hunted (Taylor et al. 2015), making the spillover to humans highly plausible.",

(2008) list 54.3 % of EID events asbeing caused by bacteria and there is good evidence to suggest that bacterial pathogens have the potential to be just as important as viruses when it comes to those that may spillover due to bushmeat-related activities, but in this capacity they have received far less attention (Cantas and Suer 2014). Transmission pathways for bacterial pathogens can occur through direct exposure to body fluids or feces, but they can also possibly be transferred indirectly through exposure to disease vectors such as fleas and ticks when handling animals. In a rare survey of bacterial pathogens that might spillover via bushmeat-related activities, Bachand et al. (2012) sampled muscle from 128 bushmeat carcasses from multiple species at markets in Gabon for the presence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella. While they only recorded the presence of Salmonella, the potential for contamination and thus spillover of enteric pathogens from carcass handling remains high, especially in the days after purchase when pathogens continue to replicate. Bacteria in the genus Leptospira are endemic sub-Saharan African pathogens that have a high risk of spillover during bushmeat-related activities as they are shed in urine. Jobbins and Alexander (2015) documented their widespread presence in wild mammals, birds, and reptiles, highlighting the role that wildlife may play in leptospirosis. The bushmeat interface may also play a role in human cases of anthrax, caused by Bacillis anthracis, which is largely a disease of grazing herbivorous mammals, but to which common chimpanzees are also susceptible (Leendertz et al. 2004). If bushmeat includes not only the hunting of apparently healthy animals but also sick animals or salvage of contaminated carcasses, the risk of human outbreaks increases (Hang\u2019ombe et al. 2012).",

However, especially for bacteria with flea or tick as vectors, as opposed to mosquitoes for example, one can envision that animal handling could present a risk. The most frightening among the vector-borne bacterial pathogens is plague, caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis and transmitted through the infected fleas of rodents. Africa remains an endemicregion of importance for this pathogen (World Health Organization 2005; Davis et al. 2006). Fleas and ticks are also responsible for transmitting rickettsial pathogens, such as Rickettsia africae, which causes African tick-bite fever ( ATBF) . Mediannikov et al. (2012) collected ticks from duikers and a pangolin that were living in close proximity to humans in Guinea and found R. africae in 10 % of ticks collected from the tree pangolin (Manis tricuspis), suggesting the potential for spillover with the close handling of these animals.

Humans engaging in bushmeat-related activities are likely exposed to these pathogens via exposure to fecal material in which eggs are shed, from transcutaneous exposure to infectious larvae, or from consumption of uncooked meat (McCarthy and Moore 2000). Several studies have examined the prevalence of helminths in animals from bushmeat markets and found high rates of multiple species. For example, Adejinmi and Emikpe (2011) collected fecal samples from greater cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus) and bush duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia) in bushmeat markets in Nigeria and documented high prevalence rates (83.3 % and 53.8 %, respectively) of helminth ova in feces as well as larvae from fecal cultures. Likewise, Magwedere et al. (2012) and Mukaratirwa et al. (2013) reviewed the evidence for Trichinella infection in humans, livestock, and wildlife in sub-Saharan Africa and noted that bush-pigs (Potamochoerus spp.) and desert warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) are a source for human infection. As is the case with many other pathogens, humans and nonhuman primates share susceptibility to many parasitic helminth species (Pedersen et al. 2005; Pourrut et al. 2011). Pourrut et al. (2011) sampled gastrointestinal parasites from 78 wild monkeys of 9 species collected from bushmeat markets in Cameroon and documented high helminth loads, including species known to infect humans. Gillespie et al. (2010) had similar findings from common chimpanzee fecal samples. Overall, the available evidence suggests that spillover of many of these pathogens during bushmeat-related activities is likely.",

The risk of protozoan spillover from bushmeat-related activities is similar to that for helminths and bacteria in that exposure to feces, bodily fluids, and even potentially to meat could transmit disease to a permissive human host (Pourrut et al. 2011). A number of protozoans are important pathogens with zoonotic potential (Taylor et al. 2001). Perhaps the best example are the amoebozoa, which cause diarrheal disease and which are documented in a variety of animals, including bushmeat species such as nonhuman primates (Gillespie et al. 2010; Pourrut et al. 2011). Gillespie et al. (2010) documented the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica and the ciliated protozoan Balantidium coli in common chimpanzees; both are human pathogens (although the direction of spillover is uncertain, as common chimpanzees and other primates may have obtained this parasite from humans). Indeed, Lilly et al. (2002) documented both protozoans in common chimpanzees, western gorillas, agile mangabeys, and humans living in the same region in Central African Republic. A number of other nonhuman primates have had documented E. histolytica infections as well (see Table 24.1). Other protozoan examples include Toxoplasma gondii, which causes the disease toxoplasmosis, but could not be detected during a recent, albeit small scale, survey of bushmeat (Prang\u00e9 et al. 2009) and water/foodborne parasites such as Giardia. Recent studies have documented Giardia in a variety of species that exist in the bushmeat trade, including western gorilla and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) (Hogan et al. 2014).",

            "text": "The risk of disease spillover from bushmeat to hunters is highest during butchering and especially if no precautions are taken. Whether hunters take precautions may depend on their knowledge and perception of disease risk. There is increasing evidence that the perception of and knowledge about zoonotic diseases is generally low but varies strongly between sites. A survey among rural bushmeat hunters and traders in Sierra Leone showed that 24 % reported knowledge of disease transmission from animals to humans (Subramanian 2012). Similarly, 23 % of rural\u2013urban hunters and traders in Ghana perceived a disease risk from a bat-bushmeat activity, with significantly more respondents associating risk with bat consumption than bat preparation or hunting (Kamins et al. 2014). Individuals who participate in butchering wild animals typically associate less risk to meat preparation and consumption than those who do not participate in butchering (Kamins et al. 2014) (Fig. 24.2). LeBreton et al. (2006) found that hunters and butchers who perceived personal risks were significantly less likely to butcher wild animals, but that risk perception was not associated with hunting and eating bushmeat. Thirty-three percent of bushmeat consumers in a Ghanaian market were not aware that zoonotic diseases could be transmitted from bushmeat to humans. Those who were aware gave Ebola (48 %) and anthrax (16 %) as examples of zoonotic diseases (Kuukyi et al. 2014). In contrast, a large-scale survey among rural Central African population showed that the majority (74 %) of respondents perceived contact with bushmeat blood or body fluids as dangerous (LeBreton et al. 2006). Unfortunately, studies in this field can be challenging, as reported perceptions may differ from actual or \u2018revealed\u2019 behaviors and beliefs (Wilkie 2006).\n",

(2006) found that only 4 % of hunters and 2 % of people reporting butchering indicated that they took precautions against contact with animal blood and fluids while hunting and butchering. Furthermore, the few that took precautions may not have protected themselves adequately, as the most common response was \u201cgenerally being careful.\u201d This was followed by \u201cwashing hands,\u201d and the least number of participants reporting \u201cavoiding contact with blood, draining blood from carcasses and wearing suitable clothing.\u201d Paige et al. (2014) examined human\u2013animal interactions in western Uganda and found that nearly 20 % of participants reported either being injured by an animal or having contact with a primate. The most commonly reported animal injuries were bites (72.9 %) and scratches (23.2 %). In a separate study, it was also shown that although Ghanaian hunters generally handle live bats, they do not typically use protective measures such as gloves, and thereby come into contact with blood through scratches and bites (Kamins et al. 2014). Given the lack of awareness and precautionary measures taken among people who come into contact with bushmeat, the opportunity for new zoonotic pathogens to spillover into humans remains high (LeBreton et al. 2006). This is especially true, since the current rate of hunting wild animals will likely continue\u2014at least until domestic animal production increases and cansupport the protein needs of the local people.",

To enhance the effectiveness of prevention campaigns, it is particularly important to reinforce the potential for infections during hunting and butchering as this may be overlooked by some hunters (LeBreton et al. 2006). Because the risk perception of hunters and those engaging in butchering wild animals has a negative association with the level of participation in meat preparation and consumption (Kamins et al. 2014), this may reduce current levels of pathogen exposure and transmission, if not by discouraging individuals to participate in preparation and consumption, then by encouraging those individuals to more proactively consider safety and preventative measures.",

When asked about what would change their behavior, participants responded; becoming ill from zoonotic disease followed by alternative livelihoods and stricter laws. Because awareness is not directly related to behavior, Monroe and Willcox (2006) suggest that campaigns should not rely on the threat of infection to change behavior, but should rather use community leaders to change cultural norms associated with hunting and educate people involved in butchering about best practices of how toprotect themselves.",

This could help detect, define, and control local human emergence while it is still locally confined and before it has a chance to spread globally. Improved detection and surveillance will lead to a better prioritization of public health efforts. One of the most effective strategies in terms of early detection of an emergent pathogenic threat would be to focus surveillance efforts among people who are highly exposed to at-risk animals and on the animal populations to which they are exposed (LeBreton et al. 2012). Bushmeat hunters would be an important target group, as they are in contact with bodily fluids from animals and are at risk for transmission and infection from novel pathogens.",

In order to track and provide data for EIDs, this effort coordinates the collection of filter-paper blood samples from both hunted animals and people who hunt and butcher wild animals. Early results have shown that this type of surveillance can assist in early detection of new diseases by offering insight into pathogen origin. It would also help describe the spillover dynamics of new or existing diseases. Such data are valuable for developing a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the processes that drive disease emergence and prevent spillovers from spreading in early stages of an outbreak. Contextualizing the relative or actual risks of spillovers would be vital for the preferential allocation of resources to high-risk regions or humans who perform high-risk activities (Daszak et al. 2007). As part of these efforts, improved knowledge of how anthropogenic environmental changes and sociological or demographic factors affect the risk of disease emergence will likely be a cost-effective and sustainablemechanism to reduce or control disease spillover risks (Daszak et al. 2007).",

Accordingly, the challenge should be addressed in a holistic manner, by integrating multiple efforts to achieve common objectives. Although much progress has been made not only in addressing the problems concerning bushmeat harvest and zoonotic disease spillover, there is much work to be done. Research that would pave the way for future efforts would include the quantification of social response to environmental policy change (e.g., in the context of harvest restriction), development of a more representative picture of bushmeat consumption in Africa, a broader exploration of the many classes of pathogens within wildlife, and more thorough understanding and quantification of the dynamics behind spillover events and the risks to humans. Such efforts could facilitate the development of policy and infrastructure that would help curb the dependency on bushmeat, reduce risks associated with bushmeat harvest, and help understand in what circumstances zoonotic disease spillover events occur.",

Such an effort might consist of surveying rural bushmeat-harvesting populations across Africa and using the resulting data to contextualize priorities and goals in a way that could help standardize education approaches. While some locations in Africa have had extensive research in the scope and impact of bushmeat harvest, much of Africa has been neglected in those efforts. A more developed understanding of the location, scale, and structure of bushmeat harvest throughout the continent would help researchers and policy-makers prioritize efforts related to disease surveillance, education, or aid. The study of zoonotic spillover events related to viruses, while not completely developed, has received far more attention than the related fields of spillover from bacterial or other non-virus pathogens. There is significant interest in pursuing these lines, as they represent an underdeveloped bodyof knowledge that could have significant impacts related to human health and disease ecology.",
