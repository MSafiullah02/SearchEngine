            "text": "Newcastle disease (ND) is a devastating global infectious disease that predominates in the poultry industry and results in severe economic losses by causing acute morbidity, reducing egg production, and significant mortality [1]. ND can infect 250 bird species via natural or experimental routes [2]. Wild migratory waterfowl, especially aquatic birds, can act as a reservoir host for most of the viruses that possess the pandemic potential and are known to be actively transmitted to other avian species. With the passage of time, it has gained serious attention with the viral evolution and re-emergence in the Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-infected susceptible birds [3\u20136]. To date, very few studies have been conducted to elucidate the NDV-mediated pathogenesis in birds, especially in the chickens. So, it is of great concern to regularly undermine and update the latest knowledge about NDV-induced immune responses in chicken. Specifically, the patterns of disease progression and the outcome significantly vary on viral strain and subtype. Therefore, the virulent NDV strain may cause severe lesions or even death in an infected chicken. Compared with chickens, ducks often show intermittent, prolonged NDV shedding [7]. Additionally, it has also been revealed that a strong humoral response is generated against NDV in chickens. Though previous studies have demonstrated that NDV replication occurs in respiratory system and lymphoid organs of chickens, there are still loop holes in viral-mediated immune escape [7]. In the present study, we aimed to explore the NDV-mediated immune response in vital organs of chickens.",

            "text": "Similar to its mammalian orthologue, chIFN-\u03b3 is a 16.8-kDa cytokine composed of 169 amino acids (aa), a 19-aa signaling segment, and a 145-aa backbone [14]. Sensitive to heat (65\u00b0C) and low pH, chIFN-\u03b3 is secreted by immune cells (i.e. NK cells and T lymphocytes) [15] and is considered to be the major macrophage activator in Aves [9,16,17]. Previous studies have revealed that chIFN-\u03b3 can halt viral replication, enhance activation of both MHC-I and MHC-II molecules, and assist in antigen presentation and processing as well as removal of intracellular pathogens [18\u201322]. Moreover, chIFN-\u03b3 activates T-helper I-type immune responses [23]. IFN-\u03b3 and its adjuvant characteristics have potential antiviral activity against avian viral pathogens such as avian influenza virus (AIV), NDV, and Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV), respectively [24\u201326]. Surprisingly, IFN-\u03b3 also facilitates the production of nitric oxide that is a significant marker of viral inhibition [27]. Identification of IFN-\u03b3 in other avian species including pigeon, duck, quail, guinea fowl, goose, pheasant, and turkey illustrates its role as a natural constituent of the innate immune system in Aves [19,28\u201330]. Like other chicken cytokines, the chIFN-\u03b3 signaling cascade is not clearly understood; however, it is thought to be similar to mammalian cytokines in that it also utilizes the classical Janus kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway [31,32].",

Moreover, the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-\u03b3 as a vaccine adjuvant has been demonstrated [33]. However, enhanced protection and a boost in avian immune response were also observed in chickens. Administration of chIFN-\u03b3 along with fowlpox and DNA vaccines resulted in elevated antibody titer, improved cellular responses, and protection against NDV challenge in chickens and turkeys [25,34,35]. Similarly, chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) do not have the key receptors required for type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) [36]. Therefore, we explored the potential of IFN-\u03b3 to act against NDV in CEFs, in vitro. There is limited data on the nature and dynamics of immune responses induced by chIFN-\u03b3 that establishes an antiviral state that can then be used to guide the development of more reliable and advanced therapeutics in poultry, with the aim of preventing respiratory viral infection, replication, and shedding. To date, most of the commercially available IFN-\u03b3 preparations are produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli. Standardization of expression conditions and a lack of glycosylation render these IFN-\u03b3 preparations more protease-resistant compared with the glycosylated forms that have a shorter half-life in the blood. Endotoxin contamination, inclusion body formation, and complex protein purification from E. coli increase production costs of E. coli-derived IFN-\u03b3 [37,38].",

CEFs were produced from 9- to 11-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) at the Biotechnology Research Institute Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Beijing, China) as previously described [39]. Nine-day-old SPF ECEs were acquired from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and maintained at 37\u00b0C. Briefly, CEFs were cultured in Media 199 (M199) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Carlsbad, USA), an antibiotic cocktail of 1% penicillin and streptomycin (P/S; Gibco) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. Similarly, the B. mori-derived cell line (Bm5) was cultured in TC100 culture media (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% FBS at 27\u00b0C as previously described [40]. For co-transfection, Bm5 cells were grown overnight with FBS-supplemented TC100 media to achieve 90% confluency (i.e. 1 \u00d7 106 cells per well) in a 6-well plate. TC100 media was used for washes to completely remove the FBS. A cocktail of transfection and co-transfection mixture was poured in it. Fresh FBS was added to the cell culture media 4\u20136 h post-transfection. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 was used to infect Bm5 cells over 1\u20132 h in order to perform viral amplification and expression. Velogenic NDV strain F48E9 (chicken-origin NDV, genotype IX) was prepared in 10-day-old SPF ECEs and maintained in our laboratory. Briefly, the virus was proliferated in 9- to 11-day-old SPF ECEs, titrated with Hemagglutination assay (HA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

Briefly, the chIFN-\u03b3 gene was inserted into a plasmid containing a Pph promoter and ORF1629+ and then co-transfected with reBmBac into Bm5 cells. Similarly, the recombinant virus containing the chIFN-\u03b3 gene was acquired 5 days after co-transfection. Likewise, chIFN-\u03bb was harvested 100\u2013120 h post pupae infection.

The chIFN-\u03b3 treatment significantly inhibited NDV replication in CEFs in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Table S2). Next, to analyze the stages of NDV infection and the extent of viral inhibition by chIFN-\u03b3 treatment, we collected supernatant at different hours post-infection (hpi). Intriguingly, we observed that pre-treatment with chIFN-\u03b3 at a concentration of 4.19 \u00d7 103 IU/ml significantly reduced the viral replication in CEFs at a regular interval (12, 24, and 36 hpi) (Fig. 2).

The significant differences in gene abundance were documented and illustrated as hierarchical clustering (Fig. 4A). Briefly, the transcripts demonstrated significant differences in the treatment groups compared with the control group. Heat map analysis presented a visual comparison of the transcripts. In the NDV-treated group, significant gene upregulation occurred. A similar pattern was observed in chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs, but at a lower level. However, a remarkable change was seen in chIFN-\u03b3 + NDV-treated CEFs, where a significant cohort of genes was distinctly upregulated. Fascinatingly, a significant number of genes overlapped in the three treatment groups (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we used qPCR quantification to validate the pattern of expression for DEGs. The qRT-PCR results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrated that the most crucial ISGs, including viperin, MyD88, STAT1, Mx, and PKR tested in this study, are significantly upregulated. Moreover, the expressions of IL1B and JAK2 were greater in the treated group than those in the control group (adjusted P-values >0.05), which is also consistent with the findings of the RNA-seq data. Collectively, these findings strongly supported the antiviral role of ISGs in the IFN-mediated immune response. DEGs were further characterized on the basis of their abundance and fold change (Supplementary Table S1).",

Similarly, the novel gene 00372 was designated as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-related protein 1-like isoform and the novel gene 00577 as paramyosin-like, while partial and novel gene 00372 is similar to PPRC1. The protein encoded by gene 00372 is identical to PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that is broadly involved in the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis via interaction with respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) in response to proliferative signals. It is believed that alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants [51].

The cellular components included MHC protein complex, MHC class II protein complex, and membrane-related dynamics. The enriched terms associated with molecular functions were chemokine and cytokine activity, cytokine receptor binding, regulatory region DNA binding, and regulatory region nucleic acid binding (Fig. 7B). In NDV-treated CEFs, the significantly enriched GO terms in biological processes were mainly linked to regulatory processes related to nucleic acids and proteins, as well as gene expression. Among the molecular functions, cytokine activity, cytokine receptor binding, transcription factor activity, and sequence-specific DNA binding were the most significantly enriched GO terms (Fig. 7A). GO analysis of NDV + chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs showed that among biological processes, regulatory processes related to biosynthesis, metabolism, and nucleic acid synthesis were highly enriched. Similarly, chemokine activity, organic cyclic compound binding, heterocyclic compound binding, and catalytic activity were the most significantly enriched GO terms in molecular functions (Fig. 7C). Some of the highly significant biological processes observed in the NDV + chIFN-\u03b3 vs NDV treatment groups include immune responses, immune system processes, cytokine activity, chemokine activity, chemokine receptor binding, cytokine receptor binding, MHC protein complex, MHC class II protein complex, and antigen processing and presentation (Fig. 7D). In short, this analysis showed that distinct biological processes were enriched in all treatment groups, suggesting that diverse biological processes are initiated in response to NDV, IFN-\u03b3, and NDV + IFN-\u03b3 treatment.

            "text": "A large amount of ISGs are induced by chIFN-\u03b3, which changes the traditional view that primary CEFs are optimally responsive to IFN-\u03b3 [56]. In fact, a previous study found that chIFN-\u03b3 had antiviral activity against MDV [30]. It has been suggested that chIFN-\u03b3 treatment elicits a broad set of antiviral ISGs, especially in the viperin gene (RSAD2), a potent antiviral gene that is expressed in response to viral pathogens [57]. Additionally, overexpression of RSAD2 in IFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs further confirmed the induction of ISGs following chIFN-\u03b3 treatment in vitro. Furthermore, studies have also shown that in chicken IFNs, cell-type specificity is unusual and distinct from mammalian IFNs in receptor\u2013ligand interactions. It has recently been shown that chIFN-\u03b3 induces ISGs and sustains a potent antiviral environment in host cells [58]. Interestingly, all three types of chicken IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) are upregulated in response to NDV infection [53]. However, upon infection with velogenic NDV, IFN-\u03b3 is significantly upgraded in the bursa of Fabricius, while expression of IFN-\u03b3 does not markedly reduce the proliferation and replication of NDV in vitro [26,59]. Here, GO and KEGG analyses revealed overlaying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Mx, one of the most significant ISGs in host\u2013pathogen interactions, is mainly responsible for creating a barrier against different bacterial and viral pathogens [60]. The upregulation of Mx expression in response to chIFN-\u03b3 treatment is characteristic for all ISGs and confirms ISG expression in vivo.",

It has also been reported that changes in cell membrane fluidity are due to IFITM whereby it either generates curvature in the membrane or interferes with the cholesterol homeostasis within the host cells [61]. We observed that the upregulation of IFITM-1 in chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs further increased the sequential expression of ISGs post-IFN treatment.

Similarly, it has been observed that this IFN has a direct impact on the maturation and differentiation of lymphoid cells, the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and the regulation of immunoglobulin production by B cells [62]. It has been established that IFN-\u03b3 treatment initiates a complex downstream signaling cascade in a cell that results in the production of signal transducers, especially STAT1, tumor suppressor gene (IRF-1), IL-12, CXCL10, chemoattractants including (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4) and ISGs [62,63]. Fascinatingly, the same phenomenon was observed in IFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs, where significant upregulation of STAT1, IRF-1, and other associated genes was reported. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed distinct biological features in all treatment groups. In order to replicate in the host cells, viruses need to breach the immune and metabolic processes of the host cells [38]. We found this to be the case when we observed significant variations in cellular metabolic processes (i.e. 1281 genes upregulated and 1033 genes downregulated) in NDV-treated CEFs. However, in response to IFN-\u03b3 treatment, the most highly significant GO terms were mainly associated with immunity. Interestingly, in NDV + IFN-\u03b3-treated cells, a significant number of DEGs were found to enrich in both metabolic and immune processes. Moreover, co-treatment of chIFN-\u03b3 and NDV synergistically upregulated ISG expression compared with only NDV treatment. Upregulation of crucial biological processes, key immune responses, and metabolic processes in this context requires further investigation. Nonetheless, our findings revealed the fundamental cellular and molecular basis involved in chIFN-\u03b3-mediated immune response.",

MDA5 mimics the function of RIG-1, which is absent in Aves, by recognizing both long and short dsRNA. Therefore, communication between the laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and MDA5 induces a potent antiviral response in chickens [65]. Significant upregulation of MDA5 in response to chIFN-\u03b3 treatment suggested that chIFN-\u03b3 stimulates PRRs that in turn elicit an antiviral environment against RNA viruses (e.g. AIV, NDV, etc.). Additionally, as type-1 transmembrane proteins, TLRs are highly conserved [66]. Compared with a human genome that contains TLR1 to TLR10, the chicken genome contains single genes of TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, two genes of TLR2 isoforms (chTLR2 type I and II), and two TLR1/TLR6/TLR10 orthologues [67]. Interestingly, as the chicken genome is devoid of TLR8 (non-functional) and TLR9, only TLR3 and TLR7 are crucial in RNA viral recognition and sensing [68]. Overexpression and upregulation of TLR7 in response to chIFN-\u03b3 further changes the role of chIFN-\u03b3 in the avian innate immune response in primary cells. Considerable upregulation of TLRs post-chIFN-\u03b3 treatment in CEFs further increases the expression of ISGs in a temporal fashion. Additional comprehensive research is necessary to evaluate chIFN-\u03b3 as an alternative, effective, and unique therapy for the poultry industry.",

Surprisingly, the upregulation of IFIT5, STAT1, Mx1, RSAD2, IL15, ZC3HAV1, and IRF8 further suggested that a common pattern of ISGs expression occurred in both IFN-\u03b1- and IFN-\u03b3-mediated immune response in CEFs. Additionally, the upregulation of potent ISGs, including RSAD2 (viperin), IFIT5, and Mx1, demonstrated that an antiviral environment has been generated in the IFN-treated cells, which could stop the propagation of viral pathogen. Similarly, upregulation of identical chemokines, cytokines, and transcription modulators strongly suggested that patterns of gene expression are in common between IFN-\u03b1- and IFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs. Although this study primarily focused on IFN-\u03b3, a more precise and comprehensive study including a broad set of chicken IFNs can now be possible to elucidate the IFN-mediated immune response in chicken cells. More work is required to understand the innate immune signaling cascade associated with type II IFNs. Here, we identified some uncharacterized genes that are involved in avian immunity. Furthermore, in vitro CEF treatment with chIFN-\u03b3 resulted in a rapid surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine gene expression is widely used as a landmark of immune signaling due to its crucial role in immune signaling. We identified some previously described genes including chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1; ENSGALT00000003670) [69]. Chemokines are essential cytokines that are critical for avian immune responses where they govern the transportation of myeloid and lymphoid cells to the target organs [70]. CCL1 is secreted by monocytes and plays an essential role in the activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes [71]. Likewise, CCL20 is involved in eliciting early immune responses by recruiting lymphoid cells [72]. Similarly, upregulation of CCL1, CCL4, and CCL5 in CEFs suggested that they play fundamental roles in innate immunity in chickens.",

However, in previously performed studies, a significant expression of type I IFNs (INF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) was observed against NDV infection [53,54]. Surprisingly, in our experimental settings, we were unable to observe this response. This may be due to multiple reasons, including the use of different viral genotypes, the origin and source of virus, and the type of cells used to determine the NDV-mediated pathogenesis in different bird species [53]. Collectively, based on our experimental findings, we can postulate that the temporal induction of IFNs in response to NDV infection in CEFs is dependent on certain factors, including viral genotype, viral source, cell type, mode of infection, and time points of NDV infection in cells. CEFs are an invaluable tool for investigating the interactions between avian viral pathogens and immune-related genes. Since viral infection can be controlled in a cell culture system, specific changes in molecular and cellular architecture can be observed and characterized. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits influenza virus replication [73,74]. Different research groups have tried to investigate the antiviral role of IFNs, but none have managed to elucidate the chIFN-\u03b3-induced antiviral response against NDV infection in CEFs. In this work, in order to evaluate the immune state elicited by chIFN-\u03b3 in CEFs, the released NDV viral particles were counted in culture medium with and without chIFN-\u03b3 treatment. A reduction in viral load indicated that chIFN-\u03b3 actively reduced the NDV viral population. Significantly, published reports showed that ISGs have antiviral activities against NDV infection [9]. These results suggested that stimulation of the innate immune response prior to NDV infection inhibits viral propagation and the release of viral progeny. These findings provided a better insight into the innate immune responses triggered by deadly viral pathogens.",

All the genes observed in this study govern protein interactions and are directly associated with avian immunity. However, additional investigation and validation of a cohort of immune-associated genes are required to understand the avian immune response against invading viral pathogens. An extensive and inclusive study involving a broad range of genes related to immunity and several IFNs that compare and connect the unified function is required to provide a comprehensive understanding of the innate immune response cascade. Additional investigations using animal models to evaluate whether related arrays of immune response exist in chicken against chIFN-\u03b3 are also significant and will further provide a deeper insight into immune signaling in Aves.",
