Now, one major focus is to further explore its potential in vivo, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies. From the mechanism, it becomes clear that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a pivotal role in triggering RNAi. Thus, the efficient delivery of target gene-specific siRNAs is one major challenge in the establishment of therapeutic RNAi. Numerous studies, based on different modes of administration and various siRNA formulations and/or modifications, have already accumulated promising results. This applies to various animal models covering viral infections, cancer and multiple other diseases. Continuing efforts will lead to the development of efficient and \"double-specific\" drugs, comprising of siRNAs with high target gene specificity and of nanoparticles enhancing siRNA delivery and target organ specificity.",

It soon became clear that RNAi represents a particularly efficient and-at least in vitro-easy-to-use method for the knockdown of the expression of a selected target gene. Consequently, RNAi is now a wellestablished method for high-throughput analyses as well as for functional studies in vitro, including mammalian cells.",

Additionally, the infection of an organism can lead to the introduction and expression of foreign genes. While the inhibition of the activity of (aberrant) gene products, e.g., through small molecule inhibitors or inhibitory antibodies is one major focus in therapy, much attention has now shifted to an earlier step, i.e., the initial knockdown of the specific gene of interest through RNAi. However, for the in vivo application of RNAi in mammals as a therapeutic approach for reversing a pathological condition as well as for the study of particular gene functions, sophisticated strategies for the induction of RNAi are needed.",

            "text": "RNAi is a naturally occurring, sequence-specific mechanism for gene silencing. Its discovery in the nematode C. elegans (Fire et al. 1998 ) was awarded the 2006 Nobel prize for physiology or medicine. However, soon it became obvious that RNAi, although somewhat more complicated, also exists in higher organisms including mammals. RNAi relies on an intracellular multistep process, which can roughly be divided into the initiation phase (see below) and the subsequent effector phase. In the effector phase ( Fig. 1,  left) , which represents the actual RNAi mechanism, small, 21-23 bp double stranded RNA molecules (small interfering RNAs, siRNAs), are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC; Hammond et al. 2000) . Upon adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent unwinding of the double-stranded siRNA molecule through an RNA helicase activity into a single-stranded, so-called guidance RNA (Nykanen et al. 2001) , the now activated RISC (RISC*) binds to its target mRNA molecule (Martinez et al. 2002; Nykanen et al. 2001 ). This process is mediated through the sequence-specific hybridization of the guidance RNA to the mRNA target site and brings RISC into close proximity to its target mRNA molecule, which is then cleaved by the RISC nuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago 2) and rapidly degraded due to its now unprotected ends (Liu et al. 2004; Rand et al. 2004; Rivas et al. 2005 ). Since RISC is recovered for subsequent rounds, this represents a catalytical process leading to the selective reduction in specific mRNA molecules and thus resulting in decreased expression of the targeted gene. The mechanism also demonstrates the pivotal role of siRNA molecules in initiating RNAi and established the delivery of siRNA molecules as sufficient for RNAi induction (Elbashir et al. 2001a, b) .",

            "text": "In a natural, experimental or therapeutical setting, siRNAs can be directly or as precursor molecules introduced into a target cell through different strategies (Fig. 1, upper part) . This includes viral or nonviral delivery of DNAs, which are transcribed into long, double-stranded RNA molecules. In the so-called initiation phase, these dsRNAs are cleaved into siRNAs by the multiprotein complex \"Dicer\", which con-tains an N-terminal helicase domain, an RNA-binding socalled Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille (PAZ) domain, two RNAse III domains and a double-stranded RNA binding domain (Bernstein et al. 2001; Collins and Cheng 2005) . Commercially available systems explore this mechanism by providing DNA vector constructs coding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs): The double-stranded region of the shRNA is formed through hairpin formation and intramolecular hybridization and is recognized by Dicer, leading to the formation of siRNAs homologous to the target gene of interest. Alternatively, shRNA molecules can be directly introduced into the cell. However, one major disadvantage of long double-stranded RNA molecules, either directly introduced or intracellularly transcribed, is the induction of a cellular immune response through activation of the interferon system. The direct delivery of siRNA molecules into the target cell strategy largely avoids this problem, although some interferon-stimulating sequences are known as well. Furthermore, it does not require the action of Dicer (Bridge et al. 2003; Hornung et al. 2005; Sledz et al. 2003) .",

            "text": "Systematic studies on targeting efficacies have shown that optimal siRNAs can be deduced according to certain selection rules. This includes an optimal length of 19-25 bp and a guanine-cytosine content between 30 and 52%, symmetric two nucleotide 3\u2032 overhangs as well as specific nucleotides at certain positions (see, e.g., Dykxhoorn and Lieberman 2006 for review). Based on these already established criteria, several computer-based algorithms allow the identification of optimal siRNA sequences for any given gene of interest. One example is the siRNA Design Software (SDS) by the University of Hong Kong which combines algorithms from different companies and is accessible through the internet (http://i.cs.hku.hk/~sirna/ software/sirna.php). Nevertheless, any presumably optimal siRNA still requires extensive testing. This refers to a high targeting efficacy, which is, among others, also determined by variations in the accessibility of the target mRNA at different positions, as well as to the absence of any unwanted side effects. In fact, nonspecific silencing of genes due to only partial sequence homology has been described (Jackson et al. 2003) . Furthermore, in vivo some siRNA sequences, as well as longer dsRNA molecules, have been shown to activate the innate immune system leading to nonspecific effects due to the stimulation of inflammatory responses (Heil et al. 2004; Judge et al. 2005; Sioud 2005; Sledz et al. 2003) . This phenomenon seems to depend on the presence of GU-rich sequences as well as on the formulation and amount of siRNAs (Heidel et al. 2004; Ma et al. 2005; Sioud and Sorensen 2003) , and these aspects need to be considered for any therapeutic siRNA application in vivo.",

Several proof-of-principle studies have shown the delivery of fluorophor-labeled siRNA molecules into various organs (see, e.g., Bradley et al. 2005a, b; Pirollo et al. 2006; Sioud and Sorensen 2003) . Beyond that, the specific in vivo knockdown of artificially introduced reporter genes like GFP or luciferase, or various endogenous target genes, has been described.

Target molecules usually represent genes that have been shown previously to be relevant or rate-limiting for tumor growth, including growth factors and receptors as well as antiapoptotic or downstream signal transduction proteins in tumor cells. Typically, these studies involve subcutaneous or orthotopic xenografts of different tumor entities in mice, and employ various strategies for local or systemic administration of a wide variety of siRNA formulations (see below). In some cases, the antiangiogenic effect after siRNA delivery to tumor endothelial cells, rather than an inhibitory effect on tumor cells, was explored (Santel et al. 2006a, b) , or simultaneous targeting of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis both contributed to the antitumorigenic effects observed (Grzelinski et al. 2006 ). Additionally, in some studies the blockage of cancer metastasis, e.g., to the lung, liver or bone has been achieved. Taking into consideration that a large number of cancer patients die from metastases rather than the primary tumor, this represents another very relevant approach in cancer therapy.",

This includes ALN-RSV01 (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals) for targeting the human RSV after viral infection, which is the first example of an antivirus siRNA-based therapeutic in a phase I clinical study. Other companies aiming at the development of RNAi therapeutics for viral diseases include Nastech/Galenea, which are expected to start clinical trials in 2007. Benitec, in collaboration with City of Hope in Duarte, California, has developed a multi-RNA therapeutic for treatment of AIDS lymphoma. Furthermore, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was treated with Sirna-027 (Sirna Therapeutics) targeting the VEGF receptor VEGFR1 (Shen et al. 2006) , and resulted in stabilization or even improvement of visual acuity (Whelan 2005) . A 24month phase II study to evaluate multiple doses of Sirna-027 (also termed AGN211745) in the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization associated with AMD is currently recruiting patients. Targeting the ligand (VEGF) rather than its receptor, Cand5 (Acuity Pharmaceuticals) has been employed for treatment of the same disease, and in the so-called C.A.R.E\u2122 trial showed no adverse effects related to the drug. Cand5, which is now named Bevasiranib, was the first siRNA to enter both phase I and II clinical trials. Recently, SR Pharma plc announced the start of a phase I clinical trial with RTP-801i, an siRNA therapeutic licensed from its subsidiary Atugen AG that targets a gene product involved in the progression of AMD. The same company has most recently announced that the FDA has approved an investigational new drug (IND) application for a second siRNA therapeutic, AKIi-5 being developed for the treatment of acute kidney injury. AKIi-5 is expected to reduce the frequency of postsurgery acute kidney injury in high-risk patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery. Finally, after successful completion of experiments demonstrating its therapeutic efficacy in animal models of pancreatic cancer, Atu027 is scheduled to enter human clinical trials in 2007. In addition, several other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies are pursuing collaborative or internal projects for the development of drugs based on RNAi (see, e.g., Behlke 2006 for review).",

On the other hand, successful siRNAbased gene targeting relies on several preconditions: protection of the rather instable siRNA molecules from nucleolytic degradation by serum nucleases, efficient cellular uptake and subsequent intracellular release into the cytoplasm, as well as the absence of intracellular immune responses, in vivo toxicity or rapid elimination in liver or kidney.",

Bearing in mind that intracellular immune responses have been shown to be concentration-dependent, this may increase the risk of nonspecific effects in addition to other side effects and cost considerations. When siRNAs are administered locally, lower doses are sufficient since nonspecific delivery to other organs as well as renal or hepatic elimination are reduced. This approach, however, is invasive and limited to tissues that are sufficiently accessible. With regard to systemic application, several studies rely on the hydrodynamic transfection of siRNAs, i.e., the rapid (\u223c20 s) high-pressure injection of large volumes (up to 2 ml) of siRNA-containing solution. Hydrodynamic injection has led to the efficient induction of RNAi in liver as well as in kidney, lung, pancreas, and spleen and is probably due to the transient enhancement of membrane-permeability. However, in animals, side effects have been observed (Zhang et al. 2004a, b) , and in man, this method is not applicable at all.",

This siRNA complexation results in the complete protection against degradation in the presence of serum or RNase A and allows the efficient cellular uptake of the PEI/siRNA complexes through endocytosis. For any siRNA formulation, the release from endosomes is critical for siRNA delivery. In the case of PEI, the so-called \"proton-sponge effect\" postulates improved transgene delivery by cationic complexes, which contain H + -buffering polyamines, based on enhanced endosomal Cl \u2212 accumulation and subsequent osmotic swelling and lysis (Behr 1997; Boussif et al. 1995) . This effect may also apply for PEI-mediated siRNA delivery into the cytoplasm.

Likewise, intrathecal delivery of PEI-complexed specific siRNAs led to successful PTN targeting and tumor inhibition in an ortotopic glioblastoma mouse model (Grzelinski et al. 2006) , or to the knockdown of the Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit protein NR2B in a rat model (Tan et al. 2005) . PEI complexation of siRNAs has also been employed in antiviral therapy studies (Ge et al. 2004; Geisbert et al. 2006) . Furthermore, PEI/ siRNA complexes are a good example for the introduction of chemical modifications to enhance tissue specificity and in vivo biocompatibility, to reduce immunogenicity and toxicity and to increase siRNA delivery through improved endocytosis and intracellular siRNA release. This includes full deacetylation of PEI (Thomas et al. 2005) , the introduction of novel low molecular weight PEIs (Werth et al. 2006) , and the coupling of PEI to other macromolecules like polyethylene glycol (PEG), either alone (Mao et al. 2006) or in combination with a ligand for tissuespecific targeting (RGD peptide for the recognition of tumor vasculature; Schiffelers et al. 2004 ).",
