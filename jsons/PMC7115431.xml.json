Global attention was soon focused on the situation because of the increasing number of new cases and the high rate of death associated with the infections [2]. As of February 23, 2017, a total of 1220 human infections with the virus, including 494 deaths, have been reported from mainland China during the former four epidemics [3]. Current evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, but small clusters of infected cases involving healthcare workers have been observed previously [4]. Phylogenetic analyses have suggested there is a possible pandemic threat from new reassortment of influenza A (H7N9) virus, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and protective measures against epidemic spread [5].",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, pandemic influenza vaccination was first provided to priority populations (e.g., older adults, public servants in key positions, students, teachers and people with chronic diseases) and then other persons in Beijing, and it was proven to be an effective strategy in controlling epidemics [11]. Our previous study showed the vaccination coverage rate was relatively low within the general adult population of Beijing, and the perceptions of not expecting to contract influenza was the predominant barrier to influenza vaccination [12]. Although Beijing has only reported 37 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H7N9) and 11 deaths as of August 2017, a potential threat of H7N9 pandemic has always been in Beijing. Therefore, preventive measures, including pandemic vaccination policy, should be prepared for possible H7N9 pandemic. Understanding the willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine and its main related factors may enable policy makers to take measures for future vaccination coverage improvement. Although several surveys have been conducted in Southern China [13], [14], [15], only one of these studied a general population while the other two focused on food producers or live poultry traders. Considering the diverse epidemic strength [16], income levels and healthcare access across China, public willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine may vary by region. In the present study, we conducted a large population-based cross-sectional survey to estimate residents\u2019 willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine and to identify its associated possible factors in the general adult population of Beijing at the end of the second epidemic wave.",

Weighted analysis was conducted to calculate the standardized proportion of people who would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, accounting for age and living area (urban or suburban) in Beijing population, as reported in the 2010 Census of Beijing [17]. Descriptive analyses were initially performed to generate frequency distributions of the survey variables. Differences among the subgroups were tested by Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test. Logistic regression models were then performed to examine the factors associated with residents\u2019 willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Demographic characteristics of participants and residents\u2019 perceptions regarding H7N9 were included as the independent variables. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the variables were calculated. All the statistical tests were two-sided, with p value <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS Version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, New York, United States).",

Unlike the unforgettable experience of SARS in 2003, the emergence of H7N9 had not caused public panic yet; a previous study also showed this result [22]. In addition, a study in China showed that the experience of H1N1 pandemic in 2009 did not also result huge in society [23]. This may be explained by the great progress in the mechanism for emergency responses to emerging infectious diseases after the SARS outbreak in China.

Our estimate during the epidemic of H7N9 was also consistent with some findings from a systematic review during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [25] (56.1% in the United Kingdom [26], 64% in the United States [27] and 54.7% in Australia [28]).

Second, the current study did not include 'I do not know' option, which could also lead to information bias. Nevertheless, a large proportion of the participants who had not heard of H7N9 and thus more likely to report 'I do not know' option were not included in the analysis of willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. In addition, during the survey, very few participants asked the interviewers whether there was an 'I do not know' option. Thus, we believed that the participants who might otherwise have chosen 'I do not know' accounted for only a small proportion, if any, of the total participants. Third, because the households but not individuals were selected at random in this study, the statistical effect of this further clustering would be to increase design effect and result in inappropriately narrow confidence intervals. Fourth, the rates for uptake willingness may differ from season to season because of changing conditions such as mortality rates and epidemic strength, which suggests the need for continued monitoring in Beijing. Finally, the findings of this study are representative at the level of Beijing, perhaps Northern China, but considering the diverse epidemic strength, income levels and healthcare access across regions, our observations might not be generalized well to other countries or regions.",

Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine in the future, and a large proportion of them had doubts about the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness and were not concerned about disease risk, which were the factors affecting residents\u2019 willingness to accept H7N9 vaccination. Therefore, health education programs targeted at increasing public perceptions towards disease risk and vaccine\u2019s effectiveness are warranted to improve the willingness of vaccination for potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness.",
