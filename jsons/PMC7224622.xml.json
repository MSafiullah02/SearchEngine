With the unpredictable nature of the pandemic to come, we set dual clinical goals of caring for current patients as well as being prepared to care for a possible wave of COVID patients. We reorganized the schedules of the residents in our program to prioritize the consolidation of services with the minimum number of providers to care for current in-patients, general surgery consults, and to staff the trauma and acute care surgery services, which have seen an increase in volume. Adjustments to these schedules were made on the basis of daily service and hospital census reports, number of new consults, and operative volume. This required creating additional leadership positions within our residency program to include a chief resident dedicated to data monitoring with input from the program director.",

This served multiple purposes. The \u201cweek off\u201d allows for a significant portion of the workforce to be outside the hospital and able to practice physical distancing. If residents were exposed while in the hospital, the week off would allow time for manifestation of symptoms. Finally, it would allow for a large \u201creserve pool,\u201d should staffing requirements change. Subspecialty fellows who had completed a general surgery residency program and were board-certified/eligible, were incorporated within the call system and have additionally been credentialed, as appropriate, to serve as Clinical Associates in General Surgery if our institution requires escalation to a Stage 3 Pandemic Emergency Status in the future.",

Later, we transitioned to performing only cases that were determined to be medically necessary and time-sensitive using published guidelines and a novel case triage system based on procedural factors, patient factors, and consideration for outcomes should we pursue nonoperative treatment.",

With this in mind, we sought to emphasize the need for physical, but not social distancing. Our residents have found solace in regularly scheduled video conferencing and \u201ccheck-ins\u201d with each other and our faculty members, which has allowed us to maintain our usual social networks, share accomplishments large and small, and address fears and concerns. The resident \u201creserve force\u201d and attending faculty (and their families) have further taken the opportunity to care for the inpatient team. The norm has become frequent check-ins, the provision of food, and a listening ear. Our program has been further supported by our GME Department with weekend meals, care packages (including thermometers, toiletries, toilet papers, and so on), and complementary access to hotel rooms, use of car services, and child care.",

We further limited all resident shifts to 12 hours, eliminating 24-hour calls. This served multiple purposes. Residents have been able to achieve more regular sleep-wake cycle and maintain a higher level of alertness in an environment that requires attention to detail for sustained adequate personal protection and minimizing self-exposure.",

We have been heartened to find no shortage of willing residents, with most longing for involvement and volunteer opportunities. As seen in many hospitals across the country, we have plans to employ a dedicated procedure team staffed with surgical residents and attendings, the enthusiasm for which has been palpable. With the assistance of our GME leadership and centralized hospital incident command center, we have made contingency redeployment plans for faculty, trainees, and advanced practice providers for possible future escalation to a ACGME Stage 3 Pandemic Emergency Status.",

Questions surrounding potential rationing of care and moral distress have been omnipresent and serve as a point of anxiety going forward. To this end, the Department of Surgery has relied upon its longstanding culture of integrating the institution's center for clinical medical ethics with a bi-weekly, open invitation ethics forum via videoconferencing. This has functioned as an outlet for individual clinicians and residents to engage with our medical ethics faculty, discuss practical issues, as well as address theoretic concerns that may arise. Discussion topics have included strategies for mitigating moral distress and future moral injury, rationing of care, an inside look at the Italian COVID experience, and muzzling of concerns from health care workers.",

From the first days when it became apparent that we would see changes in our daily routine, our department Chair instituted a regular update policy, detailing changes to anticipate. Departmental and program leaders, as well as top hospital administrators, representatives from hospital epidemiology, and psychology have made themselves available and regularly attended resident videoconferences. In doing so, a culture of information and availability has been established and is being further built upon as we progress further into the crisis. When concerns arise, as they inevitably do, all within the residency program have felt agency to have a voice and to be heard. This is a time to promote togetherness and the value of communication, uniting residents, attendings, and hospital leadership. Our residents have been empowered to participate in work on multidisciplinary teams to establish a novel COVID-specific informed consent process, management of massive transfusion protocols in trauma surgery, and stewardship of personal protective equipment.",
