Methods: Case records of the children with CF who had a pulmonary exacerbation with documented acute respiratory viral infection between October 2013 and December 2014 (Group I) and an equal number of controls (Group II) with pulmonary exacerbation in absence of acute respiratory viral infection were reviewed. Outcome measures: The two groups were compared for the following outcomes over a period of 12-18 months: bacterial colonization, antibiotics usage, pulmonary exacerbations, numbers of outpatient visits, hospitalization and oxygen therapy and spirometric parameters. Results: In total, 46 children [23 each with viral infection (Group I) and without viral infection (Group II)] of age 7-264 months were enrolled; baseline clinical status and pulmonary function tests were comparable. Mean (SD) follow-up duration in those who had viral infection and who had no viral infection was 15.7 (7.1) and 17.5 (5.4) months, respectively.

Rhinovirus has been reported as major viral pathogen in CF with detection rates reaching up to 87% from samples collected both during exacerbations and routine visits [12] . In our cohort too, rhinovirus was the most commonly detected (60.7%) virus. In a prospective multi-birth cohort study by Armstrong et al.

A temporal link was proposed between viral infections and new pseudomonas infection [14] [15] [16] . There are currently limited data available to determine the effects of viral infection on the CF lung microbiota. In vitro studies have shown that RSV and influenza virus increase the adherence of pseudomonas to human airway [10, 17] . It was also shown that RSV promotes growth of pseudomonas biofilms through modulation of the immune response and pathogen iron metabolism [18] , while rhinovirus promotes the free movement of Pseudomonas from biofilms [19] . In contrast to what was believed, a recent study on dynamic interaction between respiratory viruses and the lung microbiota in children recently reported that viral infection had no impact on bacterial diversity [20] . In our cohort, three children in each group were found to have new Pseudomonas infection in follow-up, which suggests that viral infection may not be the only factor involved in colonization of Pseudomonas in airway epithelium of CF children. Viral infections in CF patients are associated with decline in pulmonary function. The majority of studies had shown declining trend of FEV1 and FVC in long-term follow-up in those CF patients who had virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection [7, 21, 22] . Some studies like that by Ramsey et al. [8] showed no effect on pulmonary function tests (Vital Capacity (VC) or Residual volume (RV)/Total Lung Capacity (TLC)) in the follow-up of children with CF after viral infection. A recent review on clinical impact of respiratory viruses in CF suggests that high burden of viral respiratory infection in children with CF is likely to be linked with progression of CF lung disease [23] . In our cohort, both the groups had shown decrement of lung function tests over the follow-up period with more decrement in Group 1, though statistically not significant.

In our cohort, 87.5% of mortality was constituted by Group I who had viral infection. This can be attributed to the severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization in this group of children. In total, 6 of 18 (33.3%) children who required hospitalization in Group I (CF with viral respiratory infection) died by the end of follow-up period. In a predictive model, CF patients who required hospitalization more than twice a year were 3.5 times more likely to die within 2 years [24] . In a similar survival prediction model comprising data from 5820 CF patients selected from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, each acute pulmonary exacerbation within the first year of follow-up increased the risk of death by 1.5 times in the following 4 years [25] . In a prospective cohort study conducted on 446 adult CF patients, more than two exacerbations per year had a greater risk of lung transplant or death during the study than those with less than one exacerbation per year (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.05) [26] . All of our patients had at least moderate pancreatic insufficiency as suggested by presence of history of frequent, foul-smelling and oily stools. We also note that our patients were malnourished at baseline in both the groups along with low FEV1, which might have contributed to the high mortality in part. Supportive care apart from antibiotics during pulmonary exacerbation plays an important role in the care of CF patients. In our clinic, we do advise and demonstrate regarding chest physiotherapy, inhalation therapy such as hypertonic saline (3% saline) and daily enzyme replacement therapy. However, we do not routinely use DNAse, potentiators or correctors because of cost constraints.
