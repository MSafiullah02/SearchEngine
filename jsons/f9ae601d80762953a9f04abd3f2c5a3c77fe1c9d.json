In clinical studies, however, standard DNA injection alone generally induces low levels of transgene-specific immunity when compared to other vaccine approaches. In order to boost the immunogenicity of this platform, next-generation DNA vaccines require additional techniques such as the administration of electroporation. This new method involves the generation of a brief electric field in tissue around a local injection site that results in the transient poration, or permeabilization, of the cellular membranes. As a result, antigen-specific immune responses are greatly enhanced and are likely due to increased DNA uptake and antigen expression. Thus, electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination represents a promising new strategy for the elicitation of strong immune responses directed against the expressed antigen(s) and not the vector, and ongoing studies are currently underway to optimize the working parameters of this technique. Here, we review the uses of this technology in conjunction with vaccination and suggest future directions for its further exploration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The discouraging results from the recent human HIV trial performed by Merck and collaborators, named \"STEP,\" raises serious questions about current vaccine approaches using replicationdefective viral vectors [1] . This study was an international phase II \"test of concept\" trial in uninfected volunteers at high risk for acquiring HIV infection which showed that vaccination using a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 vector was ineffective at preventing virus infection and even increased the rate of transmission in individuals exhibiting prior immunity to the viral vector. While this vaccine was safe and immunogenic in both humans and nonhuman primates, eliciting long-lasting and multifunctional CD8 + T cell responses that were partially protective in rhesus macaques, the discovery that the vaccine could possibly heighten HIV infection was both unexpected and alarming, resulting in the immediate discontinuation of vaccinations as recommended by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board for STEP. Since preexisting immunity against a vaccine vector may compromise its efficacy in humans, future vaccine approaches should aim to utilize vectors that exhibit minimal or no reactivity in immunocompetent vaccines. DNA vaccination consists of the administration of genetic material encoding a desired antigen that when expressed in the vaccine, is capable of eliciting an immune response. Compared with other approaches, the advantages of DNA vaccination are many [2] ; no infectious agents are involved and vaccines are unable to revert into virulent form like live vaccines. They can prime both cytotoxic [3] and humoral responses [4] , and DNA vectors are easily manipulated, can be tested rapidly, produced at high yield in bacteria, and are readily isolated. They are also more temperaturestable than conventional vaccines, easily stored and transported, and do not require a cold chain. Furthermore, DNA vaccines could potentially induce immunity in newborns in situations that usually neutralize conventional vaccines via the presence of high levels of maternal antibodies [5] . The introduction of exogenous DNA into cells or tissue can be achieved using DNA conjugates [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , virus-derived vectors [11] , or naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) [12] . Naked pDNA shows variable and low transfection efficacy when administered by conventional means, such as needle injection or topical application. However, several strategies aimed to improve pDNA vaccine immunogenicity have been developed, including codon optimization [13] , mRNA optimization [14] , addition of leader sequences [15] , and construction of consensus immunogens [16] . While these strategies help to boost the overall immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine, they may not be applicable to all antigens. Recently, electroporation, or electropermeabilization, has gained great interest in multiple research areas including gene therapy and vaccinology [17] . Although the precise mechanism of action has not yet been well defined, it is hypothesized that cell membranes in host tissue receiving electroporation, normally impermeable to charged molecules, form pores or functionally equivalent structural changes upon application of an external electric field which facilitate the influx of macromolecules. Thus, higher transfection efficacy of naked pDNA as a result of electroporation is thought to be the major contributor to the increased immunogenicity of electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination. In addition, it has been shown that electroporation increases vaccine potency by activating antigenpresenting cells (APCs) via danger signals and local inflammation [18] and by recruiting immune cells to the site of DNA administration [19, 20] . Furthermore, direct transfection of APCs could also be facilitated by electroporation. Currently, intensive investigation is focused upon utilizing electroporation of muscle and skin as an effective method for DNA vaccine delivery to small and large animals, and in humans. The safety and feasibility of electroporation in humans has recently been demonstrated, but not finally proven [21] . Thus, the paramount question for DNA vaccines at this time is whether a sufficient level of efficacy can be reached with the present methodology, or if further improvements or breakthroughs in vaccine design and/or electroporation delivery will be necessary.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 211, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1476, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1619, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1645, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2092, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2190, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2191, "end": 2194, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2198, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2202, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2236, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2271, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2543, "end": 2547, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2568, "end": 2572, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2608, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2652, "end": 2656, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2936, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3647, "end": 3651, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3717, "end": 3721, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3722, "end": 3725, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4113, "end": 4117, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In 1990, the first transgene expression detected in skeletal muscle after injection of naked mRNA or pDNA raised the possibility of using this method for certain gene therapies and DNA vaccinations [22] .

Enhanced immune responses to electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination have been observed both in small and large animals such as mice [26] , pigs [27] , and monkeys [28] . Widera et al. [26] demonstrated in mice that upon electroporative treatment, the delivery of a weakly immunogenic hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (Hbs Ag) DNA vaccine resulted in an increased humoral immune response, characterized by rapid onset and higher titers of anti-Hbs Ag antibodies. In addition, the authors observed in the same study that the potency of an HIV gag pDNA vaccine was increased as shown by the lower dosage of DNA required to induce higher antigen-specific antibody levels and increased CD8 + T cell responses. Similarly, in a study carried out with a bovine herpes virus-1 truncated glycoprotein D DNA vaccine, Tsang et al. [29] showed that the onset of the primary humoral response was earlier in the group treated with DNA followed by electroporation, and that this group produced higher antibody levels than those in the group receiving i.m. DNA immunization or a recombinant protein vaccine only; similar results were obtained earlier with [94, 95] an otherwise inert microparticulate adjuvant [30] . Interestingly, the efficiency of transfection by electroporation was not increased by doubling the dose of DNA administered; however, the duration of the antigen-specific antibody response was increased at a higher rate in comparison to the immunization with the same dose of plasmid without electroporation. Moreover, electroporation increased the degree of consistency among the individuals in the DNA-plus-electroporation group as seen in the 5 weeks of follow-up. Finally, a high correlation between the duration of the primary immune response and the magnitude of the secondary antibody response was observed, implying that electroporation could represent an effective approach to elicit a longer memory antibody response. Capone et al. [31] have demonstrated that gene electrotransfer efficiently increased the cellular immune response both in mice and rhesus macaques vaccinated with a plasmid encoding a nonstructural region of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In particular, they showed by ex vivo interferon (IFN)-g ELISPOT assay that electroporation in mice induced a fivefold more potent T cell response than DNA administration alone, and that the elicited response was directed against all six of the antigen pools spanning the HCV NS3-NS5B region. To assess whether electroporation treatment elicited similar responses in a nonhuman primate model, they immunized rhesus macaques three times with the vaccine and collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells at periodic intervals to test the T cell effector function. The immune responses observed in the electroporation-treated group showed a faster kinetic, with all the animals responding after the second challenge and reaching a peak after the third. Moreover, all animals treated with electroporation showed both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses, in comparison to the naked DNA group which showed a weaker CD8 + response and no CD4 + response. Finally, gene electrotransferimmunized macaques maintained anti-HCV effector T cells for the entire observation period of 6 months, indicating that the gene electrotransfer efficiently elicited a strong memory T cell response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 273, "end": 277, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 285, "end": 289, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 304, "end": 308, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 325, "end": 329, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 967, "end": 971, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[94,", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1295, "text": "95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1345, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2090, "end": 2094, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 134, "text": "Table 18", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Electroporation and Plasmid DNA Vaccine Immunogenicity"}, {"text": "DNA vaccination in association with electroporation represents an effective strategy to elicit strong, broad, and long-lasting B and T cell responses. Although muscle is the most common target for DNA vaccine immunizations [32] , the presence of APCs in both the skin layers makes it an attractive target for nucleic acid vaccination, since direct transfection of APCs may be important for T cell priming upon skin DNA immunization [33] (Fig. 18.2) . In a murine model using a viral [34] have demonstrated that a single intradermal (i.d.) injection (without electroporation) of naked DNA encoding the influenza nucleoprotein gene is sufficient to induce production of antigen-specific antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes that persist for at least 68 weeks and are protective against a lethal challenge with a heterologous strain of influenza virus. Furthermore, immune responses to i.d. DNA vaccination have been recorded to be significantly enhanced by in vivo electroporation [35] ; analysis of the antibody response to an Hbs Ag-encoding plasmid delivered i.d. upon electroporation in mice has revealed a strong enhancement of the T h 1 response, which is mainly characterized by a strong cell-mediated response, compared to that elicited by protein immunization, which showed an exclusively T h 2 pattern, characterized by a dominant humoral responses. Also, in a nonhuman primate model study carried out in rhesus macaques [36] , the i.d.-plus-electroporation group developed 50% more IFN-g-producing cells and twice more memory T cells than the group not treated with electroporation. Higher antibody responses were recorded in the i.d.-plus-electroporation group when compared to the i.m.-plus-electroporation group.

Local inflammation was previously proposed to augment immune responses in studies where pDNA was coinjected with bupivicaine-HCl [39] [40] [41] . The localized tissue damage induced by the electric field is thought to recruit CD3 + cells, increasing the number of infiltrating immune cells at the injection site [42] . Indeed, electroporation caused the activation of proinflammatory signals including the expression of chemokines such as MIP-1a, MIP-1b, MIP-1g, IP-10, MCP-2, and XCL1 [18] . Liu et al. [20] characterized the extent and nature of the cellular infiltrates at the site of electroporative vaccine delivery in mice and found both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells localized in the perivascular spaces and throughout the muscle tissue. In particular, they observed a significant increase in B cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and a dramatic increase in macrophages and dendritic cells compared to vaccination alone. No difference, however, was recorded among cell populations of blood, spleen, and draining lymph nodes of the mice treated with or without electroporation, suggesting that only local factors are involved in the augmentation of immune responses following electroporation. Also, these authors observed that cell infiltrates were transient and resolved within 2 weeks.

Many adjuvants are ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs), like monophosphoryl lipid A and CpG DNA [44, 45] , while some conventional adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide and incomplete Freud's adjuvant are free of TLR ligands [46] . Therefore, these examples demonstrate that multiple innate immune recognition and signaling pathways are required for adjuvants to function [44] . In the case of DNA vaccines, it has been controversial as to the main vaccine component contributing most to the induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses; while CpG motifs expressed within the plasmid backbone can stimulate innate immunity through TLR 9, the induction of adaptive immune responses were unaffected in the absence of this innate receptor [47, 48] . However, it has recently been shown that the doublestranded structure of DNA, independently of CpG sequences, possesses immunomodulatory effects when administered intracellularly [44] , which can trigger TLR-independent, TANK-binding kinase I (TBK1)-and INF regulatory factor 3-dependent innate activation of both immune and nonimmune cells to produce type I INFs and their inducible genes [49, 50] . Recently, Ishii et al. [51] have reported that the enhancement of DNA vaccine immunogenicity achieved by electroporation may be due to increased transfection rates resulting from this technique, which better contributes to local inflammation by activating cells to produce IFN through the TBK1-dependent signaling pathway. These data suggest that TBK1 is a key signaling molecule for DNA vaccination immunogenicity by regulating innate immune signaling, which is critical for the induction of adaptive immune responses, and that the enhanced immunogenicity of pDNA by electroporation may be a result of more pDNA interacting with intracellular TBK1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 146, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 253, "end": 256, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 377, "end": 381, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 524, "end": 528, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 898, "end": 902, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 903, "end": 906, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1303, "text": "[49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1307, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1337, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Electroporation-Mediated Local Inflammation"}, {"text": "In accordance with this hypothesis, Peng et al.

Proper design of pulses and electrodes will maximize the effectiveness of a given DNA vaccine and minimize unwanted side effects, such as long-lasting histological changes, pain, and muscle contractions. Further discussion of electroporation parameters and equipment can be found in Chaps. 4 and 5.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 522, "text": "Fig. 18.3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Electrical Parameters and Electroporation Equipment"}, {"text": "Skin is a potentially interesting target tissue for DNA vaccines because of its natural role in the immune defense of the body and its ready accessibility.

Since complications may arise due to the use of viral-based vectors, such as preexisting immunity regulating vaccine effectiveness and the possibility of reversion into virulence that may decrease vaccine efficacy or safety, alternative approaches should be explored for future vaccine approaches. DNA vaccination appears an even more attractive candidate for future vaccines since it is safe, immunogenic, and does not stimulate vector-specific immunity. Extensive literature supports the hypothesis that electroporation represents a valid approach to vaccine administration in that it increases the consistency and potency of vaccination, inducing higher levels of both antibody-mediated and cytotoxic T cell responses. In this way, electroporation may help augment translocation of exogenous DNA into the nucleus. Furthermore, it has been proven to be effective in enhancing immune responses to antigens regardless of the degree of transgene expression achieved. Recent evidence suggests that innate immune recognition of the adjuvant component of vaccines and the danger signals provided by the method of vaccination may be important in determining the magnitude of the resultant immune response. Electroporation may enhance local inflammation at the site of immunization by facilitating the transfection of greater amounts of pDNA, which may be more readily available to interact with intracellular signaling proteins that trigger the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and their . Needle-type electrodes consist of a variable number of (primarily) stainless steel needles arranged in different configurations. Picture depicts a 5-needle array firing rotating chord patterns, a 4-needle array fired in opposing pairs, crossing or triangular patterns, and a 2-needle array firing pin to pin inducible genes. While electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination is currently the topic of intensive research, more theoretical studies and practical trials are required to optimize the delivery of the vaccine into the target tissue, and the electrical parameters facilitating DNA uptake while calibrating local tissue damage and reducing pain associated with vaccine delivery through electroporation.", "cite_spans":
