Most cases are in China, but 1174 cases have also been reported in 25 other countries, with 9 deaths and a case fatality rate of 0.8%. All 3 viruses are zoonotic, their origin attributed to bats, with an intermediary step to other mammals (civet cats in SARS, camels in MERS and, it seems, pangolins in COVID-19)4. The new virus has probably emerged due to coexistence in the intermediate host of a bat coronavirus and a human one, capable of infecting man and being transmitted from person to person. There are 4 other coronaviruses that can cause the common cold.",
