            "text": "When an antibiotic interferes with the growth of bacteria, it does so by undermining the integrity of the cell wall or by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis or common metabolic pathways. The effect is termed either bactericidal or bacteriostatic. These broad categorizations may not apply for a given agent against all organisms, however.14 Bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria, generally by inhibiting cell wall synthesis or by interrupting a key metabolic function of the organism. Agents of this type include the penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, daptomycin, rifampin, and metronidazole. Bacteriostatic agents inhibit bacterial growth, do not interfere with cell wall synthesis, and rely on host defenses to eliminate bacteria. Agents of this type include the macrolides, tetracyclines, sulfa drugs, chloramphenicol, linezolid, and clindamycin. The use of specific agents is dictated by the susceptibility of the causative organism, at a given location, to individual antibiotics. However, when neutropenia is present, or if there is accompanying endocarditis or meningitis, the use of a bactericidal agent is preferred. Thus, for most patients with pneumonia, it is not essential to choose a bactericidal agent. One additional consideration is that certain organisms can produce toxins, and antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis (linezolid, clindamycin) may have an advantage in toxin-mediated illnesses, such as those caused by certain strains of S. aureus, when compared with cell wall\u2013active bactericidal antibiotics.15\n",

            "text": "The antimicrobial activity of a specific agent is often described by the terms minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC refers to the minimum concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of 90% of a standard sized inoculum, leading to no visible growth in a broth culture. At this concentration, not all the bacteria have necessarily been killed. MBC refers to the minimum concentration needed to cause a 3-logarithmic decrease (99.9% killing) in the size of the standard inoculum; generally, all pathogenic bacteria are killed at this concentration. The MIC is used to define the sensitivity of a pathogen to a specific antibiotic, under the assumption that the concentration required for killing (the MIC) can be reached in the serum in vivo. However, these terms must be interpreted cautiously in patients with pneumonia because the MIC data do not consider the penetration of an agent into lung tissues and sites of infection. Thus, if an agent achieves infection site concentrations that exceed serum concentrations, the efficacy may be better than predicted by the MIC data. Concerns about antimicrobial resistance have led to the emergence of a newer term, the mutant prevention concentration (MPC).16 The MPC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that prevents bacterial colony formation from a culture containing greater than 1010 bacteria. At lower than MPC concentrations, spontaneous mutants can persist and be enriched among the organisms that remain during therapy. The clinical relevance of this concept is still uncertain.",

For this reason, these agents have been studied for delivery through the aerosol route. Local administration of antimicrobials has been used in the therapy of bronchiectasis, especially in the setting of cystic fibrosis, and in the treatment of VAP. Direct delivery of antibiotics is usually achieved by nebulization. This approach achieves high intrapulmonary concentrations, and it may do so without substantial systemic absorption. Thus, the risk of systemic toxicity is reduced. The use of this approach in mechanically ventilated patients is somewhat anecdotal, and not carefully studied, but it has been proposed for patients with either infectious tracheobronchitis or VAP.19,\n20 Both infections can involve highly resistant gram-negative bacteria, and the local delivery of antibiotics may effectively treat some pathogens that cannot be eradicated by systemic therapy.",

When aerosol therapy is used in mechanically ventilated patients, it must be carefully synchronized with the ventilator cycle, and the optimal delivery device is not yet defined. In an animal model, investigators found that by using an ultrasonic nebulizer placed in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the Y-connector, up to 40% of the administered dose could be retained in the lung; the tissue concentrations achieved were 10 times higher than possible with comparable doses given systemically, and systemic absorption was minimal.22,\n23 To optimize delivery, inspiratory time may need to be as high as 50% of the ventilatory cycle, and routine humidification should be stopped during antibiotic administration. In ventilated patients, the ventilator may need to be set with a tidal volume of 8 to 10 mL/kg, with no humidification system in use during the use of the ultrasonic nebulizer, which should be set to deliver 8 L/minute.",

With once-daily aminoglycoside dosing, the patient achieves a high peak concentration (maximal killing) and a low trough concentration (minimal nephrotoxicity); this regimen relies on the postantibiotic effect (PAE) to maintain the efficacy of the antibiotic after the serum (or lung) concentrations fall to less than the MIC of the target organism. If an antibiotic has a PAE, it is capable of suppressing bacterial growth even after its concentration falls to less than the MIC of the target organism. In clinical practice, the use of once-daily aminoglycoside dosing has had variable benefits in both efficacy and toxicity.26 Most of the agents that kill in a concentration-dependent fashion have a prolonged PAE, whereas agents with little or no PAE against gram-negative bacteria are generally also agents that kill in a time-dependent fashion, hence they are given several times daily.",

For patients not at risk for P. aeruginosa, therapy should be with a selected \u03b2-lactam combined with either a macrolide or a quinolone.6,\n27 Recommended \u03b2-lactams include ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ampicillin-sulbactam. Ceftriaxone can be given from 1 g daily to 2 mg twice daily; the latter is recommended for severe pneumococcal infection, especially with associated meningitis. All patients require the addition of either a macrolide or a quinolone for possible atypical pathogen (Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, or C. pneumoniae) infection, either as the sole cause or as part of a mixed infection. Some studies, including those involving severe CAP, have shown that the addition of this type of coverage is associated with a lower mortality rate than when other regimens are used.30, 31, 32 The recommended macrolide is intravenous azithromycin (500 mg/day for 7 to 10 days) because it is better tolerated than erythromycin. The recommended quinolone is moxifloxacin (400 mg/day), regardless of renal function or levofloxacin (750 mg/day), for patients with normal renal function. In patients with abnormal renal function, levofloxacin doses should be adjusted, after using the same initial starting dose for all patients. In addition, several retrospective studies of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia demonstrated that dual therapy including a \u03b2-lactam combined with a macrolide or a quinolone is associated with improved outcome, compared with single-agent \u03b2-lactam therapy.33,\n34 For the penicillin-allergic patient, therapy should be with an antipneumococcal quinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) in addition to aztreonam.",

In addition, more cultures and diagnostic testing are needed to rule out infection with an unusual pathogen (fungus), another diagnosis (inflammatory lung disease), or another site of infection or pneumonia complication (central line infection, empyema, antibiotic-induced colitis). When a patient is not responding to initial therapy, a change in antibiotics, combined with an aggressive diagnostic reevaluation, should be carried out no later than day 3.",
