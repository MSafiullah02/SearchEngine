            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) act as cross-species viruses and have the potential to spread rapidly into new host species and cause epidemic diseases. Despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), there are currently no drugs available for their treatment; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are urgently needed. To search for effective inhibitory agents, we performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of a 2,000-compound library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds using the established genetically engineered human CoV OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strain expressing Renilla luciferase (rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc) and validated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro. We screened 56 hits from the HTS data and validated 36 compounds in vitro using wild-type HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, we identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. Additionally, we found that emetine blocked MERS-CoV entry according to pseudovirus entry assays and that lycorine protected BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This represents the first demonstration of in vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor the effect of lycorine on the spread and distribution of HCoV-OC43 in a mouse model. These results offer critical information supporting the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Currently, there is no approved therapy to treat coronavirus infection; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed. Based on our high-throughput screening assay using a compound library, we identified seven compounds with broad-spectrum efficacy against the replication of four CoVs in vitro. Additionally, one compound (lycorine) was found to protect BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting novel CoV infections in the future.",

Lycorine, an active alkaloid from the common folk medicine Lycoris radiata (Amaryllidaceae) has been investigated for its multifunctional biological effects, including anticancer, antimalarial, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Lycorine showed potent anti-CoV activity, with EC 50 values ranging from 0.15 M to 1.63 M. Moreover, the selective index (SI) of lycorine for HCoV-OC43 was calculated at 29.13, indicating its potent (Fig. 2E) . Mycophenolate mofetil, a derivative of mycophenolic acid, showed an antiviral effect on the four CoVs similar to that of mycophenolic acid, suggesting that the two drugs might harbor similar core structures and antiviral mechanisms ( Fig. 2C and E) . Moreover, phenazopyridine, a widely used urinary analgesic, also displayed strong broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity for the first time, especially against MHV-A59 (EC 50 of 0.77 M and SI of \u03fe25.97) (Fig. 2D ). Pyrvinium pamoate is an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug and a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling, suggested to occur through direct activation of protein kinase CK1\u2423 (24) . Pyrvinium pamoate inhibited the replication of all CoVs and displayed low toxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ], \u03fe19 M) (Fig. 2F ). Finally, monensin sodium, previously shown to inhibit the formation of gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), inhibited all CoVs at low EC 50 values and displayed low toxicity (Fig. 2G ). Although the specific antiviral mechanisms of these seven inhibitors against CoVs are unknown, they showed potential as new antivirals for the treatment of infections caused by a range of CoVs. Validation of anti-CoV activity. We verified the antiviral activity of the seven inhibitors against HCoV-OC43 by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A , all seven inhibitors significantly suppressed HCoV-OC43 replication, compared with that of the control (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), and with a \u03fe90% inhibitory effect for most compounds, except for monensin sodium. Additionally, we observed inhibitory activity when the cells were treated with the inhibitors after viral infection, resulting in significantly reduced levels of HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein (Fig. 3B ). Although the inhibitory effect of mycophenolic acid differed according to IFA and Western blot results, the seven inhibitors clearly suppressed HCoV-OC43 replication.",

Inhibition of this step can block viral propagation at an early stage of infection, thereby minimizing the chance for the virus to evolve and acquire drug resistance. Therefore, we tested the effect of the seven screened inhibitors on CoV entry using a pseudotype virus with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) backbone but expressing the spike protein of MERS-CoV in order to generate dose-response curves. Measurement of the inhibition percentage showed that only emetine was an entry inhibitor that blocked MERS-CoV S-mediated infection, with luciferase activity reduced 50-fold compared with that of the control and an EC 50 value of 0.16 M (Fig. 4) .",

Moreover, this model was convenient based on the lack of need for three biological facilities, in contrast to experiments involving SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Therefore, we used this model to evaluate the in vivo antiviral activity of the seven inhibitors. Intracerebral or intranasal inoculation of HCoV-OC43 results in acute-onset severe neurological illness and causes death, with high levels of viral replication in the brain (titer, \u03fe10 6 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]/ml) at 3 to 5 days after infection (26) (27) (28) (29) . Briefly, female BALB/c mice (12 days old) were inoculated via the intranasal route with 100 TCID 50 of HCoV-OC43-WT and treated with the seven inhibitors for 14 days, and their survival was monitored for up to 20 days. The inhibitor doses and regimens were selected based on acute-toxicity assessments. Emetine was used at 5 mg/kg, and chloroquine was used as the positive control, which showed antiviral activity at 30 mg/kg. All mice in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-DMSO-treated group died within 6 days after HCoV-OC43-WT challenge (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, 83.3% of mice in the lycorine-treated group were still alive at 20 days postinoculation (P \u03fd 0.001), similar to the survival rate of the chloroquine-treated group (Fig. 5A) . Additionally, viral loads in the brain and spinal cord were under the limit of detection in the lycorine-treated group (Fig. 5B) , and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of mouse brain coronal sections showed that HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein was present only in the PBS-DMSO-treated group, not in the lycorine-treated group (Fig. 5C) .",

Indeed, no specific antiviral agent or vaccine is currently available for human or zoonotic CoV infections, despite the extensive research efforts triggered by the SARS outbreak (30) (31) (32) . Several FDA-approved drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, mycophenolic acid, and ribavirin) inhibit the entry and/or replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or other human CoVs in multiple cell lines; however, their antiviral efficacy in vivo remains unknown (16, (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . To date, few small molecules have demonstrated anti-CoV activity in animal models of CoV infection (17, 38, 39) , and most of the available anti-CoV drugs that target structural proteins might not be effective against other CoVs. For example, the human monoclonal antibodies and antiviral peptides that block virus-host cell binding typically have a limited breadth of protection due to the antigenic diversity in the CoV spike glycoprotein (40, 41) . It is worth mentioning that combining antiviral peptides with beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) (40) or combination therapy with different humanized or human monoclonal antibodies targeting non-crossresistant epitopes (42) can enhance antiviral therapeutic effects. There are also several reports of the enhanced therapeutic effects of combinations of other antiviral agents for the treatment of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that the combined use of different antiviral agents might be synergistic in their treatment of CoV infection.",

In our experiment, we focused on screening hits with higher potency and, therefore, so established the inhibition threshold at 70%. Furthermore, we identified several effective hits with a high degree of cytotoxicity under 10 M in our primary screening, which was why the cytotoxicity value was set to 80%. Finally, we identified 36 compounds exhibiting anti-HCoV-OC43 activity from a library of compounds, two of which (chloroquine and loperamide) were previously reported as exhibiting broadspectrum anti-CoV activity. Nine compounds (phenazopyridine, lycorine, pyrvinium pamoate, monensin sodium, cetylpyridinium chloride, oligomycin, loperamide, harmine, and conessine) have not previously been demonstrated as exhibiting antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, thereby offering new therapeutic possibilities for this severe CoV. Furthermore, seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) showed inhib- mice \u03fe20 days after intranasal inoculation of HCoV-OC43, followed by treatment with the indicated inhibitors (n \u03ed 6/group). Inhibitor doses and regimens were selected based on their acute toxicity (emetine was used at 5 mg/kg, chloroquine was used at 30 mg/kg, and the other inhibitors were used at 15 mg/kg). (B) Viral loads in the mouse brain and spinal cord treated with lycorine. Twelve-day-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated via the intranasal route with 100 TCID 50 HCoV-OC43-WT and treated with lycorine or DMSO control for 3 days. At 72 h postinfection, viral loads in the mouse brain and spinal cord were determined by qRT-PCR. Data represent the mean \u03ee standard deviation (error bars) of the results of three independent experiments. (C) IHC analyses of brain tissue from mice treated with lycorine. Twelve-day-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated via the intranasal route with 100 TCID 50 HCoV-OC43-WT and treated with lycorine or DMSO control for 3 days. Mouse brain coronal sections were stained for HCoV-OC43 N (green) and nuclei (blue). itory activity against multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations (EC 50 values ranging from 0.12 to 3.81 M). Among these, lycorine is an alkaloid isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants and reportedly exhibits anticancer, antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and emetic activities (43) (44) (45) . Lycorine inhibits the replication of poliomyelitis virus, herpes simplex virus 1, Bunyamwera virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV in vitro, although the mechanism remains to be elucidated (46) (47) (48) (49) . Liu et al. (50) demonstrated the ability of lycorine to reduce the mortality of human enterovirus 71-infected mice by inhibiting viral replication. Furthermore, Guo et al. (51) evaluated a total of 32 lycorine derivatives, demonstrating that 1-acetyllycorine suppressed enterovirus 71 and hepatitis C virus replication in various cells. Moreover, drug resistance analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine targeted a phenylalanine (F76) in the viral proteases. Lycorine also exhibits strong activities against influenza A virus H5H1 in vitro and delays the export of nucleoprotein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during replication (52) . However, the potential mechanism of lycorine against CoVs requires further exploration, and its potential selection for drug-resistant strains must be assessed. We found no reports concerning whether its use in combination enhances the antiviral efficacy of lycorine. Additionally, emetine is a drug used mainly as both an antiprotozoal and an emetic (53) , with a number of groups recently reporting new antiviral roles for emetine. Emetine is reportedly a potent inhibitor that suppresses the replication of several RNA viruses (dengue virus and HIV) without generating drug-resistant variant viruses (54) (55) (56) . We noted that emetine inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication by disrupting the HCMV-induced interaction between p53 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (57). Moreover, a recent study revealed emetine as an inhibitory modulator of rabies virus axonal transport via a mechanism independent of protein synthesis inhibition (58) . Furthermore, Yang et al. (59) demonstrated that emetine inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) replication via inhibition of ZIKV NS5 polymerase activity and disruption of lysosomal function. In the present study, our preliminary result indicated that emetine inhibited MERS-CoV entry. Interestingly, the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid and its derivative mycophenolate mofetil, which suppress MERS-CoV replication (33) , also inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication (EC 50 values of 1.95 and 1.58 M, respectively). However, a previous study showed that MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets treated with mycophenolate mofetil had more severe forms of disease and higher lung viral loads than did untreated animals, and renal transplant recipients on maintenance mycophenolate mofetil therapy reportedly developed severe or fatal MERS (60) . Therefore, these two inhibitors are unlikely to be useful against CoV infections. Monensin sodium, which affects IBV and MHV-A59 assembly (61, 62) , was also identified as an inhibitor of other CoVs (MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCov-NL63) in this study.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of BLI to evaluate the effects of antiviral agents on CoV replication and dissemination in vivo without the need for sacrificing animals to quantify viral titers and establish the complete pattern of virus dissemination in the central nervous system. However, most of the data and conclusions concerning the antiviral effects of the inhibitors were derived only from one cell line and should be tested in different CoV replication cell lines in order to exclude the influence of host cell factors, especially for MERS-CoV, for which there are a larger number of susceptible cell lines (e.g., Huh 7 or Calu3/2B4 cells). Therefore, further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to determine the potential antiviral mechanisms associated with the seven compounds, as well as their clinical efficacy. Additionally, the efficacy of lycorineinterferon combinations should be explored in animal models.",
