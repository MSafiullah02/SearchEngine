            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi complex prior to exocytosis. The small CoV envelope (E) protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which require residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E in a recombinant virus background results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (WT) IBV-infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with an increased Golgi luminal pH. Infection with IBV or expression of IBV E induces neutralization of Golgi pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cell factors, protecting IBV S from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus-induced alteration in the microenvironment of the secretory pathway. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV E protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics exist. Understanding the role of the CoV E protein in virus assembly and release is thus an important prerequisite for potential vaccines as well as in identifying novel antiviral therapeutics.",

The structure and function of the Golgi complex depend upon an acidic pH gradient that decreases from the lumen of the cis-Golgi to the lumen of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This pH gradient is produced by a balance maintained by proton influx into the lumen of the Golgi complex, proton leak, and counterion conductance (4) . Pharmacological and other manipulations of the pH gradient that result in neutralization of the lumen have all been shown to cause slow trafficking of cargo through the Golgi complex as well as alteration in Golgi morphology (4) (5) (6) (7) . A class of small viral membrane proteins with ion channel activity, called viroporins (8) , has been shown to have dramatic effects on the secretory pathway, similar to those elicited by pharmacological manipulation of luminal pH. Several well-studied members of this viroporin family of proteins include the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 protein, and the CoV envelope (E) protein. These representative viroporins demonstrate several common functional features despite differences in viral assembly and budding locations. It has been suggested that the role of M2 in the secretory pathway is to neutralize luminal pH to protect the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein of influenza from premature activation (9) (10) (11) . Overexpression of M2 causes secretory pathway disruption where the rate of intracellular trafficking is slowed and Golgi morphology is altered (5) . HCV p7 is also thought to play a protective role by allowing egress of viral structural proteins through the secretory pathway. HCV lacking active p7 can be partially rescued by both pharmacological neutralization of the luminal spaces by bafilomycin A1 and in trans expression of IAV M2 (12, 13) . Similar to M2, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus E protein elicits multiple secretory pathway disruption phenotypes when overexpressed in mammalian cells (14) .",

Replacing the HD of IBV E with a heterologous sequence of the same length does not impair Golgi targeting or interaction with IBV M during assembly (16, 17) but would be expected to impair ion channel function. One-step growth curves revealed that IBV EG3 grew to a titer 10-fold lower than that of wild-type (WT) IBV in infected Vero cells. At late times postinfection, the majority of infectious virus resides in the supernatant surrounding WT IBV-infected cells, while the majority of infectious IBV EG3 is intracellular (15) . Vero cells infected with IBV EG3 accumulate more IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane than WT IBV-infected cells, and this accumulation of IBV S leads to increases in the size and rate of formation of virus-induced syncytia (15) . Highly purified virions from IBV EG3-infected cells lack a full complement of spikes, and most S is cleaved near the virion envelope, likely explaining the reduced infectivity of released particles (14) . A buildup of vacuole-like compartments containing virions as well as other aberrant material in IBV EG3-infected cells may explain the damage to S (14, 15) .",

Two residues in the HD of SARS-CoV E, N15 and V25, have been shown to promote viral fitness during infection (19, 20) . Mutation of N15 or V25 abolishes ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E in artificial membranes (19, 20) . We previously reported that the E protein of IBV expressed in mammalian cells is found in two pools by velocity gradient analysis: a low-molecularweight (LMW) pool and a high-molecular-weight (HMW) pool (21) . The LMW pool represents IBV E in a monomeric state, while the HMW pool correlates with a homooligomer of IBV E. When mutations corresponding to the conserved HD residues of SARS-CoV E that inhibit ion channel activity are made in IBV E (T16A and A26F), the HD mutants segregate primarily into one oligomeric pool or the other. The E T16A mutant is primarily in the HMW pool, while the E A26F mutant is primarily in the LMW pool. The presence of the LMW pool of IBV E, the predominant and likely monomeric form found when E A26F is present, correlates with the secretory pathway disruption associated with the WT IBV E protein (21) . This was surprising in that it suggested an E ion-channelindependent role for IBV E associated with manipulation of the secretory pathway. It was recently reported that that these HD mutants abolish ion channel activity of IBV E in artificial membranes, and virus titers are reduced by a log in the supernatant of infected cells, suggesting a defect in virion release (22) . Our data on the IBV EG3 corroborate data from that study (15) .",

The S protein of the mutant virus with an HD replacement in the E protein (IBV EG3) is subject to further proteolysis near the junction of the protein with the viral envelope, resulting in a C-terminal fragment that we term the \"stub\" (Fig. 1A) (14) . To compare the processing of the S protein in virions from cells infected with WT IBV and IBV EG3, supernatants from cells infected for 18 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 were clarified, and virions were enriched by spinning through a 20% sucrose cushion. The pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes S1 (3C7B8) (25) and a polyclonal antibody raised to the C terminus of S that detects S2 fragments, including the stub (26) . As shown in Fig. 1B and C, EG3 virions have significantly less S1 than do WT virions, with an increased fraction of a fragment that runs at about 65 kDa. EG3 virions also have reduced S2 and increased S2= and stub compared to WT virions. We previously reported that nearly all of the S in purified EG3 virions was cleaved to the stub (14) . We believe that the additional cleavage in the purified virus occurred during isolation, as multiple steps (including two sucrose gradients) were performed in the absence of protease inhibitors, unlike the enrichment procedure described here. These results suggest that IBV EG3 encounters cellular proteases more readily than WT virus or that the S protein undergoes a conformational change that is more conducive to processing during trafficking of virions.",

            "text": "IBV induces an increase in Golgi luminal pH during infection. One possible explanation for the aberrant processing of S in IBV EG3-infected cells is that the microenvironment of the secretory pathway is altered when the E viroporin activity is normal (15, 18, 21) but is unaltered in IBV EG3-infected cells. Given that the effects of IBV E overexpression on the Golgi complex are similar to those in cells where the luminal pH is neutralized (4, 6, 7), we measured the luminal pH of the Golgi complex in IBV-infected Vero cells. We used flow cytometric analysis of a ratiometric pHluorin molecule targeted to the Golgi lumen with a reporter consisting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) pHluorin molecule fused to the membrane-targeting sequence of the trans-Golgi network-resident protein TGN38 (6) . We chose to use the trans-Golgi network pHluorin molecule because the TGN is the most acidic compartment of the Golgi complex, and thus, any alteration in pH would likely be most detectable in this compartment. We generated a clonal Vero cell line that stably expressed pHluorin-TGN38 ( Fig. 2A) . The generation of this cell line allowed us to ensure that all infected cells were expressing pHluorin-TGN38. The cells were treated with cycloheximide for 60 min to chase newly synthesized TGN38-pHluorin from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To generate a pH calibration curve, uninfected cells were subjected to treatment with buffers ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.5 in the presence of the ionophores monensin and nigericin prior to flow analysis. The emission ratios of the biphasic pH-sensitive pHluorin at these known pH values can then be used to construct a standard curve (Fig.  2B ) and predict the Golgi luminal pH in cells infected with IBV in buffer at physiological pH and lacking ionophores (Fig. 2C) . Infection resulted in a robust increase in the Golgi luminal pH (Fig. 2D and E) . Pellets were electrophoresed on NuPAGE 4-to-12% gradient gels and after transfer to PVDF membranes were probed with mouse anti-S1 and rabbit anti-S2, followed by IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG and IRDye 680CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG. The left panel is a merge of the 800-nm and 680-nm wavelengths of the Li-Cor image showing that S1 and S2 essentially comigrate on these gradient gels. The middle and right panels show the signal for the S1-specific mouse monoclonal 3C7B8 and the rabbit anti-S C terminus antibodies (Ab), respectively. The cleavage products are indicated, as are the positions of the molecular weight markers (in kilodaltons).

            "text": "The increase in Golgi pH correlates with the LMW pool of IBV E. To determine the role of IBV E oligomerization and, by inference, viroporin activity in the alteration of Golgi luminal pH, we analyzed two HD point mutants of IBV E that segregate into different oligomeric states. Our previous findings suggest that IBV E A26F is found predominantly in the LMW, likely monomeric, form and that IBV E T16A is found predominantly in the HMW, higher-order oligomer (21) . In addition, we analyzed the EG3 mutant of IBV E, with a complete HD replacement. Both IBV E T16A and IBV EG3 had trans-Golgi pH measurements similar to those of the IBV M membrane protein control (pH 6.95 and pH 6.87, respectively), while IBV E A26F elicited a pH increase similar to that of the wild-type IBV E protein (pH 7.18) (Fig. 4A ). This suggested that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the luminal pH increase of the Golgi complex in addition to the secretory pathway disruption demonstrated in our previous work (15, 18, 21) . The same experiment was performed with a medial-Golgi-tagged pHluorin, GnT1 (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I)-pHluorin, to assess if the alteration in pH was specific to the TGN. Here, a standard curve was generated from cells expressing GnT2-pHlorin alone. Expression of either IBV E or IBV E A26F elicited a robust pH increase (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, IBV E T16A increased the pH significantly although not as robustly as IBV E and IBV E A26F . We found that the pH of the trans-Golgi network (measured with pHluorin-TGN38) was higher than that of the medial-Golgi (measured with GnT1-pHluorin). This was unexpected and is addressed in Discussion. We previously reported that the T16A mutant was not completely inactive in Golgi disruption (21) , and the better dynamic range of the medial-Golgi pHluorin is likely the reason why we were able to measure a significant increase at the medial-Golgi but not in the TGN. Altogether, the results in transfected cells implicate the monomeric form of IBV E in neutralization of the Golgi lumen during infection and transfection. Attempts to rescue IBV EG3 by manipulation of Golgi pH. Despite intense efforts, we were unable to conclusively determine whether an increase in Golgi pH could rescue the deficiencies of IBV EG3. We used two different methods to neutralize acidic compartments: drugs (bafilomycin A1, monensin, or ammonium chloride) and overexpression of influenza A virus M2, a pH-activated proton channel. However, the drugs inhibited exocytosis at all concentrations used (during short or long infections), including release of virus. For IAV M2 transfection, we were unable to obtain a high percentage of transfected cells that were subsequently infected with IBV EG3. In several experiments where the percentage of transfected and infected cells was greater than 40%, we obtained 40% to 75% increases in the release of infectious IBV EG3, but most experiments failed to show a reasonable overlap of transfection and infection and rescue of IBV EG3 infectivity (data not shown). Additionally, attempts to make stable lines expressing M2 and pHluorin-TGN38 did not yield lines expressing M2 at a level high enough to alter Golgi luminal pH. We thus turned to another approach to assess the role of neutralization of the Golgi membrane by IBV E.",

We predicted that neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E during infection protects the IBV S protein from premature proteolysis at the normal acidic pH of the trans-Golgi network. We also predicted that processing and trafficking of IBV S in the presence of a protein that can alter pH (i.e., IBV E or IAV M2) would be similar, while one deficient in this (IBV EG3 or E T16A ) would produce premature cleavage and more IBV S at the surface of cells. To test these predictions, we first demonstrated that when transiently overexpressed in Vero cells, IAV M2 neutralized the trans-Golgi network in our pHluorin/flow cytometry assay in the absence of the M2 inhibitor amantadine but not in the presence of 5 M amantadine, as expected ( Fig. 5A and B ) (5, (9) (10) (11) . With proof of principle established for M2 pH alteration during transfection, cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding IBV S and IBV E, or IBV EG3, with or without the IAV M2 protein. Surface biotinylation was performed, and the level of IBV S at the cell surface after streptavidin pulldown was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C ). As predicted, there was a significant increase in the total amount of IBV S at the surface of EG3-expressing cells compared to cells expressing WT IBV E. Notably, the presence of M2 in EG3-expressing cells reduced the amount IBV S at the surface of cells compared to cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 5D ). We also measured the total amounts of cleaved IBV S species (S2, S2=, and stub) in transfected cell lysates (without surface biotinylation). We analyzed only S2 fragments, since most of the S in transfected cells is S0, and the S1-specific monoclonal antibody signal was too weak to detect S1 and smaller fragments in this assay. The levels of S2 and stub in EG3-expressing cells were significantly reduced when M2 was coexpressed, with an increase in S0 similar to levels in WT E-expressing cells (Fig. 6A and B) . Importantly, aberrant processing of IBV S in cells cotransfected with the empty vector or IBV E T16A could be abrogated by expression of IAV M2 (Fig. 6C and D) . On the other hand, the presence of M2 had no effect on IBV S processing in cells expressing WT IBV E or IBV E A26F , and cells expressing these IBV E constructs always had less S2 and undetectable levels of the stub. These results suggest that neutralizing Golgi luminal pH could indeed reduce trafficking of IBV S to the plasma membrane and protect it from premature cleavage.",

The cycling of pHluorin-TGN38 is likely to be the predominant reason for a higher-than-expected TGN pH, since the medial-Golgi pHluorin reported a pH of \u03f36.4 (Fig. 4B) . We believe that the consistent shift in the Golgi pH in cells expressing IBV E is more important than the actual baseline pH value that we observed with pHlorin-TGN38. Previously, the TGN38-pHluorin construct was used to demonstrate that CHO cells lacking the counterion channel Golgi pH regulator (GPHR) had a 0.4-pH-unit increase (6) , which substantiates the magnitude of the observed pH increase in this study.",

Our analysis of the HD mutants of IBV E demonstrated that neutralization of the TGN induced by overexpression of wild-type IBV E correlates with the presence of the LMW, likely monomeric, pool of IBV E, which is the predominant form of the protein observed in cells expressing the IBV E A26F mutant (Fig.  4) . The IBV E A26F mutant elicited a pH shift slightly higher than the increase observed with the WT IBV E protein. However, the IBV E T16A or IBV EG3 HD mutant did not cause a statistically significant pH shift in the trans-Golgi lumen. We previously showed that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with secretory pathway disruption (21) , including Golgi disassembly and slow trafficking of model cargo proteins, observed when the wild-type IBV E protein is expressed (15, 18) . We hypothesized that the Golgi disruption was likely occurring in an IBV E ion-channel-independent manner (21) . This study corroborates our hypothesis and suggests that the monomeric form of IBV E causes Golgi disruption via alteration of Golgi luminal pH through a mechanism involving interaction with a host protein. This interpretation is strengthened by evidence demonstrating that neither the IBV E T16A nor the IBV E A26F mutant has ion channel activity in artificial membranes (22) , suggesting that any remaining HMW, oligomeric IBV E that may be present when IBV E A26F is expressed is not likely eliciting secretory pathway disruption or pH neutralization via IBV E ion channel activity. However, To et al. recently reported that mutation of IBV E at T16 but not A26 prevents oligomerization of IBV E, the opposite of our findings (22) . The difference in these results is likely due to different modes of protein expression and the downstream assays used to evaluate oligomerization. In our studies, we expressed the HD mutants in mammalian cells and evaluated oligomerization via velocity sucrose gradient analysis followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of gradient fractions of interest (21) . To et al. bacterially expressed these proteins and then analyzed them via native PAGE after purifying and resolubilizing the samples (22) .",

This change in conformation may also release the S1 subunits from the S2 subunits of the CoV S trimer (29) . A possible detrimental consequence of the normal acidic Golgi pH for the virus could be that the S protein is subject to a conformational change and premature, and possibly excessive, proteolytic processing, resulting in the release of the S1 subunit prior to receptor binding. This would result in noninfectious or impaired virions. Indeed, the level of S1 in EG3 virions is lower than in WT virions, compared to the level of total S2 (Fig. 1B) . Our data also indicate that when IBV S is expressed in cells alone or in the presence of EG3 or IBV E T16A , the levels of IBV S cleavage species are increased significantly compared to those of IBV S in the presence of IBV E, IBV E A26F , or IAV M2, lending support to the hypothesis that the neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E protects IBV S from premature cleavage (Fig. 6) . Additionally, when overexpressed in cells with EG3, S is present to a greater extent at the cell surface than when expressed with WT E (Fig. 5D) , corroborating previous data observed during IBV EG3 infection (15) .",

Addi-tionally, the SARS-CoV 3a protein has been shown to induce Golgi fragmentation as an antagonist of the Arf1 GTPase involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex (38) . Further study of these SARS-CoV viroporins outside the complicated context of infection, especially their ability to induce pH changes in the lumen of the secretory pathway, will inform our studies on the IBV E protein.",

While other viral viroporins (e.g., IAV M2 and HCV p7) have been shown to alter the luminal microenvironment, IBV E appears to do so by a mechanism that does not involve its ion channel activity. Whether the role of the putative IBV E-interacting protein(s) is pH maintenance, vesicle formation, membrane architecture, protein glycosylation, or any number of jobs performed by constituents of the secretory pathway, interaction of the protein(s) or lipid(s) with the large amount of IBV E known to reside at the ERGIC could disrupt the pH directly or indirectly by interfering with normal secretion or architecture of the Golgi complex. In summary, studies addressing CoV E protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, and the development of tools to evaluate ion channel activity in vivo, will go a long way in elucidating the precise mechanisms of the multifunctional family of viroporin proteins.",

Total DNA for each transfection was adjusted to 2 g with the empty vector. Cells were lysed in 100 l of a detergent solution (as described above) at 21 to 24 h posttransfection. Approximately 15% of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and blotted as described above. IBV S2 fragments were detected with anti-S CT . Equivalent samples were run on a separate gel to detect IBV E (rabbit anti-IBV E) and IAV M2 (mouse anti-M2).",
