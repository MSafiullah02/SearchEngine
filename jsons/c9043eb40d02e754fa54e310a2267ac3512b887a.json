The emergence of new artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies gives rise to innovations that could relieve them of this burden. In this paper, we present a pipeline structure for building dialogue summarization systems. Our pipeline summarizes a consultation of a patient with a care provider and automatically generates a report compliant with medical formats. Four pipeline components are used to generate a report based on audio input. The outputs of each component are analyzed to determine the most important challenges and issues. The current proof-of-concept, which was applied to eight doctor-to-patient sessions concerning ear infection, shows that automatic dialogue summarization and reporting is achievable, but requires improvements to increase completeness.",

However, several concerns were identified, both from the perspective of patients and doctors. In case of the former, patients expressed worries about the doctor potentially getting distracted by the computer during the appointment. The latter mentioned not being able to tend to the patient while interacting with the computer at the same time. In addition, it is reported that doctors spent an estimated 32% of the appointment interacting with the computer (based on an average of six studies). In three studies, patients were found to stop talking whenever the doctor was typing [2] . Another issue is the potential loss of emotional and/or psychosocial elements. Non-verbal communication (e.g., eye contact) is important for sharing emotions between patient and physician and such information may be overlooked if the physician is interacting with the EMR [22] . In summary, challenges arise when medical staff needs to interact with the EMR during direct patient care.",

            "text": "In the healthcare domain, various attempts have been made to automatically generate documents concerned with patient data. Firstly, speech recognition is a prominent approach to reducing time spent on reporting in healthcare, as studies frequently make use of dictating after a consultation [1] . In the Netherlands, however, a mere 1% of medical staff makes use of speech recognition. Reasons for the lack of adoption are, reportedly, interference with doctors' normal way of working, lack of support by hospitals and financial limitations [17] . Secondly, Klann & Szolovits delivered a proof-of-concept framework that captures the dialogue during a doctor-patient meeting. Their approach covers the entire dialogue, rather than a report of the consultation [14] . More recently, Chiu et al. developed and tested a system that transcribes conversations between doctors and patients. Their best model resulted in a word error rate of 18.3% [9] . Again, this system delivers a medical transcription, rather than an EMR update or a report. Finally, the BabyTalk project utilizes a prototype that generates summaries in text, using physiological signals and events performed by medical staff as input. While the prototype proved to be able to generate proper summaries of clinical data, the texts provided by human experts were still superior [21] .",

In their study, NLP uses human language notes as input and returns a structured version of these notes for the EMR. Then, the EMR data feeds ML algorithms. The summarization pipeline aims to combine the two rather than execute them sequentially: both NLP and ML are used to enrich the data stored in the EMR. Without taking precautions, neural networks may overlook rare outcomes, due to the under-representation of these outcomes in training data [26] . Another possible disadvantage of using (deep) neural networks is that they often lack transparency, which limits their use in the healthcare domain [15] .",

A common problem refers to non-trivial sentence fragments such as compound nouns and phrasal verbs. For example, a phrasal verb such as 'to search for' it not easy to map to a triple; take the sentence 'I was searching my cupboard for my pills' could result either in a triple I, search, Cupboard or in a triple I, searchF or, P ills . Furthermore, coreference resolution is a well-known issue [19] , which refers to how pronouns can be linked to the noun they refer to. The use of pronouns such as 'it' or 'which' are common in medical consultations. Conflicting statements are also a hard to tackle; consider the following dialogue: suppose your finger hurts' -in this case, only the doctor's statement should be considered for triplification, but it is hard to reliably do so. The quality of triple matching could also be affected by several threats. One of them is the incompleteness of the ontology. The building and population of the ontology is a component described in [18] that only needs to be done during the development phase of the system and could involve some threats to the triple matching component. If this ontology is incomplete or has been populated for a very specific medical specialization, some concepts could be missing, and therefore the triple matching process could discard relevant information. Also, some relevant information to be included in the final report could be discarded if it belongs to a non-medical domain and it is not included in the ontology or it is not mentioned in the clinical guidelines. For instance, some experience lived by the patient, which could look like an anecdote to omit in the report, but maybe it is the precursor of the disease. Another threat to be taken into account is the way of measuring some values. For example, pain can be measured from 1 to 10, or from soft to strong, or from light to hard, etc. Despite these different categories, 1, soft and light are representing the same level of pain and this could cause errors in the categorization if this is not taken into account during the matching process. Also, some information can be repeated by the care provider or the patient, even using synonyms. This redundancy should be detected while doing the matching to avoid redundancy in the generated report.",

Once this categorization is done, the Natural Language Generation process starts. During this process, the relevant triples are ordered (text planning), each triple is converted into a standalone sentence (lexicalization) and some of these sentences are merged into longer ones (aggregation) [18] .

Secondly, precision and recall were calculated. Thirdly, the number of false positives was determined, by counting items that were included in the generated report and items that are incorrectly included (i.e., partial items).

This part is in essence 'the patient's side of the story' and may also include previously used medication. Challenge 2: The location of the item in the transcription can help mitigate these errors, by separating the Subjective and the Plan. In addition, the tense of verbs can be used, since they distinguish past medications from future ones.",

Challenge 3: Increasing the number of relevant items requires improving the quality of the triples. A small portion of the items (14.2%) could only be located implicitly: they can be inferred from the transcript, but are not explicitly mentioned. An example of an implicit item is an explanation or recommendation given by the care provider to the patient. The GP does not announce that they will explain something, but this can be observed when reading the text. Another example is that the GP may state they will perform some medical action on the patient tomorrow, which means that the patient will return for another appointment, but this second appointment is not made explicit. Challenge 4: Conversation analysis techniques can be utilized to extract implicit information from transcripts.",

Examples of observations are: (1) whether the eardrum is visible; this is part of the clinical guideline for ear infection, but the doctor makes no utterance about it, (2) if the ear canal is red, which only sometimes is mentioned out loud. Decisions made by the GP mostly refer to the diagnosis and plan. Based on the observations, they conclude a diagnosis which may or may not be communicated to the patient explicitly. Furthermore, the plan is discussed with the patient, but not in full detail. For instance, the GP will explain the patient receives ear drops, but does not specify how many of these drops they should use per day, while this is included in the report. The system, however, does allow the GP to add, modify or remove text in the report if necessary. Finally, it is hard to ascribe gestures to the GP or the patient (see T6 in Sect. 4). Oftentimes, patient mention \"I don't hear anything on this side\" or \"do you want to see the other ear as well \", in combination with pointing the GP is able to tell which ear they are referring to, but based on text alone the system cannot distinguish between left and right. Challenge 5: Video input can be used to enhance text that includes a gesture by disambiguating the antecedent to reference pronouns such as \"this\".",

Furthermore, the golden standards were written by a single GP; since medical students/professionals do not receive any formal training on writing reports using the SOEP format, other care providers might write slightly different reports. Papineni et al. referred to these situations as 'stylistic variations' [20] . Finally, some items in the golden standards are not mentioned explicitly and, thus, may not end up in the output of the triple extraction. To ensure that implicitly discussed relevant information is also extracted by the system, conversation analysis techniques are needed. For instance, when the patient and GP agree on a course of action, this is not contained in one sentence and can only be inferred from the dialogue between both [24] .",
