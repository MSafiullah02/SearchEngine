Respiratory mechanics are the expression of lung function trough measures of pressure and flow. When positive pressure is applied to the respiratory system, advance analysis of respiratory mechanics can discriminate the different elements of WOB according to equation of motion: resistive component (the resistance to displacement of a determined gas flow), elastic component (elastic opposition to a determined change of volume) and a threshold load. The threshold load refers to the amount of work required to commence inspiratory flow and it is determined by autoPEEP [10\u201312]. Interpretation of these data can help to tailor MV parameters to match the pathophysiology of the disease according to which component is predominantly compromised. For example, contemporary MV strategies for severe asthma totally differ from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

More recent studies found the same alteration in CRS, most of the time attributed to significant air trapping and lung hyperinflation [14]. We were able to describe the threshold component in our patients, and autoPEEP was not clinically relevant, a finding comparable to that in previous studies [13, 14]. Threshold or autoPEEP is a minor contributor to the total working pressure [15].

            "text": "Conflicting data exist with regard to the resistive airway component during severe bronchiolitis. Krieger et al. found that there were not clinical significant differences between inspiration and expiration in infants during bronchiolitis; even more, the latter was shortened. In that study measured KTI:KTE ratio in children with bronchiolitis was higher than normal subjects (mean 1:1.1). They stated that this finding could be explained by Otis\u2019 theory of the equality of time constants (which are the product of compliance and resistance) in a system with different airway\u2019s caliber (unequally obstructed due to varying values of resistance), and flow is rapid in such a system, measured value of resistance would be the one of the larger airways [13]. It is important to realize that respiratory system mechanics measurements in patients under controlled positive pressure MV can be altered by the way the parameters are set. For instance, high ventilatory settings can elevate PIP, without PPL changes [15]. A clinical study in 82 pediatric patients with bronchiolitis showed PIP oscillations between 25 and 45 cmH2O when children were ventilated with moderate to high VT (10\u201315 ml\u00b7kg\u22121) [17]. An augmented VT can also require longer expiratory times to allow the passive expiration, increasing the risk of air trapping and decreasing compliance due to hyperinflation. One of the strengths of our study is that MV settings were standardized and compatible with current standard of care: VT and PPL were limited and low QI were applied. This could have caused the low resistance to expiratory flow observed in our cohort. Normal values of RawE for this specific age group are scarce, but our patients\u2019 RawE was lower than data from premature newborns without significant respiratory disease on spontaneous breathing [18]. Another consideration is the instrumentation used to measure the resistance in our study. When it is measured in a Y\u2013piece, the resistive component of instrumental airway is included. De la Cruz et al. described in 21 patients that under these conditions the peak inspiratory pressure needed to ventilate the infant\u2019s lungs is overestimated compared with actual airway pressure. It would be difficult to correct this overestimation since measurements with a tracheal catheter would be really challenging (or even contraindicated) in small infants [19].",

            "text": "An interesting finding was the inverse correlation between CRS and RawE. As previously reported in patients with ARDS, this observation shows that lungs with lower CRS had higher elastic recoil [20]. This finding is concordant with our results, showing that during severe bronchiolitis the elastic component of working pressure is predominant, similar to ARDS pathophysiology. Hammer et al. described that ten out of 37 patients with severe bronchiolitis fulfilled the AECC criteria for ARDS [21, 22]. It is important to note that these infants had consolidation or infiltrates on 4 quadrants on the chest x-ray with a Murray\u2019s lung injury score greater than 2.7. In our view, this group of RSV-induced ARDS is different from the cases we are describing. We excluded patients with more than 2 quadrants of infiltrates on chest x-ray (or obvious x-ray patterns of ARDS), and also all the measurements were done within 1 h after intubation. Hammer et al., don\u2019t describe ventilatory parameters and timing of measurements. Because it was done more than 20 years ago, pre-low VT era and contemporary care of acute respiratory failure, it is difficult to compare both case series. Surprisingly the duration of MV was greater than 14 days, compared to ours that was close to 5 days. We have to acknowledge that current PALICC consensus [23] definition includes a wide group conditions and pathologies under the brand ARDS, so some of our cases might be in the gray area of that ARDS definition, even when chest x-ray was not compatible with ARDS. On the other hand, bronchiolitis is a very heterogeneous condition including a wide spectrum of diseases. In our study, we aimed to describe a relatively homogenous group of ventilated infants with severe bronchiolitis with ad-hoc contemporary care.",

Reference values for healthy children in this age group has not been specifically reported and we did not include a control group, so comparisons and increments of the different components are only estimates. As previously commented, due to small size of patients we did not measure pleural pressure, so we could not determine the contribution of the chest to CRS. A single set of measurements, very close to intubation, was done, because we did not want to use long term or multiple doses of neuromuscular blockade. Also, patients were on controlled MV without respiratory muscle activity, can influence in the low Inspiratory resistance and measured autoPEEP, because patient efforts may increase the lung volume, facilitating hyperinflation [25], being frequent the coexistence between intrinsic PEEP and active expiration. Finally, we have to acknowledge that setting of MV parameters can directly modify the component of the equation of motion (i.e. QI, RR, I:E ratio), but we tried to standardize the ventilatory setting during measurements.",
