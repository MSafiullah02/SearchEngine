Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic collection of CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult. To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.",

This is especially important, since the most frequent known etiology of community acquired pneumonia is bacterial infection in general [5] .

Especially, Wang et al [6] proposed an open source deep convolutional neural network platform called COVID-Net that is tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest radiography images. They claimed that COVID-Net can achieve good sensitivity for COVID-19 cases with 80% sensitivity. Inspired by this early success, in this paper we aim to further investigate deep convolutional neural network and evaluate its feasibility for COVID-19 diagnosis. Unfortunately, under the current public health emergency, it is difficult to collect large set of well-curated data for training neural networks. Therefore, one of the main focuses of this paper is to develop a neural network architecture that is suitable for training with limited training data set, which can still produce radiologically interpretable results. Since most frequently observed distribution patterns of COVID-19 in CXR are bilateral involvement, peripheral distribution and ground-glass opacification (GGO) [13] , a properly designed neural network should reflect such radiological findings.",

This findings lead us to propose a novel patch-based deep neural network architecture with random patch cropping, from which the final classification result are obtained by majority voting from inference results at multiple patch locations. One of the important advantages of the proposed method is that due to the patch training the network complexity is relative small and multiple patches in each image can be used to augment training data set, so that even with the limited data set the neural network can be trained efficiently without overfitting. By combining with our novel preprocessing step to normalize the data heterogeneities and bias, we demonstrate that the proposed network architecture provides better sensitivity and interpretability, compared to the existing COVID-Net [6] with the same data set.",

Therefore, the segmentation mask from Fig.  1 (a) are upsampled to match the 1024 \u00d7 1024 image size. To avoid cropping the patch from the empty area of the masked image, the centers of patches were randomly selected within the lung areas. During the inference, K-number of patches were randomly acquired for each image to represent the entire attribute of the whole image. The number K was chosen to sufficiently cover all lung pixels multiple times. Then, each patch was fed into the network to generate network output, and among K network output the final decision was made based on majority voting, i.e. the most frequently declared class were regarded as final output as depicted in Fig. 1(b) . In this experiments, the number of random patches K was set to 100, which means that 100 patches were generated randomly from one whole image for majority voting.",

Although we believe our categorization into normal, bacterial, TB, and viral+COVID-19 cases is more correlated with the radiological findings and practically useful in clinical environment [18] , we conducted this additional comparison experiments with the data set in Table IV to demonstrate that our algorithm provides competitive performance compared to COVID-Net in the same experiment set-up.

Cardiothoracic Ratio (CTR) is a widely used marker to diagnosis cardiomegaly [25] , [26] . We hypothesized that if cardiothoracic boundary become blurred by rounded opacities or consolidation in COVID-19 CXR [2]- [4] , distinct off-average CTR value can be utilized as an abnormality alarm. Statistical analysis for the potential biomarkers was performed using MATLAB 2015a (Mathworks, Natick). Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used to evaluate the normal distribution of marker candidates. For non-normally distributed variables, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare segmentation performance with identical data size, and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare COVID-19 marker candidates to those of other classes with different data sizes. Statistical significance (SS) levels were indicated as asterisks; * for p <0.05, ** for p <0.01 and *** for p <0.001.",

To evaluate segmentation performance on cross-database, we tested either original or preprocessed images of the NLM dataset as inputs. The result shows that our universal preprocessing step for data normalization contributes to the processing of cross-database with statistically significant improvement on segmentation accuracy (Jaccard similarity coefficients from 0.932 to 0.943, p < 0.001).

Lung contour of each class showed differentiable features and showed mild tendency. In normal and tuberculosis cases (the first and the second row of Fig. 3, respectively) , overall lung and heart contour were wellsegmented. In the bacterial case, however, the segmented lung area was deformed due to wide spread opacity of bacterial pneumonia as shown in the third row of Fig. 3 , and both the right cardiac and thoracic borders were lost. In overall bacterial infection cases, similar findings were occasionally observed which caused degraded segmentation performance. This suggests that abnormal morphology of the segmentation masks may be a useful biomarker to differentiate the severe infections. In the fourth row of Fig. 3 , viral infection caused bilateral consolidations [29] , thus partial deformation of lung area was observed. In the COVID-19 case of the fifth row of Fig. 3 , despite the bi-basal infiltrations [30] , lung area was fully segmented. In overall cases of the viral and the COVID-19 classes, lung areas were either normally or partiallyimcompletely segmented, so morphological features of the segmentation masks may not be sufficiently discriminatory markers for viral and COVID-19 classes. Based on these morphological findings in segmented lung area, we further investigated other potential COVID-19 biomarkers.",

However, care should be taken, since not only the locally concentrated multiple opacities can cause uneven intensity distribution throughout entire lung area, but also different texture distribution within CXR may cause the similar intensity variations. For example, multi-focally distributed consolidation from COVID-19 could make the intensity variance differentiating factor from other classes, but also bacterial pneumonia generates opacity as well, whose feature may lead to the similar intensity distributions as results of different characteristics of opacity spreading pattern.",

As shown in Fig. 5(a) , the inter-patch intensity distribution of the unified COVID-19 and viral class showed distict lower intensity values (p <0.001 for all) to other classes and highly intensity-variant characteristics which can be represented as the large error bar. This result is in accordance with the result of lung area intensity and intensity variance ( Fig. 4(a), (b) ). Intra-patch intensity distribution, however, showed no difference compared to the normal class (p >0.05). From these intra-and inter-patch intensity distribution results, we can infer that intra-patch variance, which represents local texture information, was not crucially informative, whereas the globally distributed multi-focal intensity change may be an important discriminating feature for COVID-19 diagnosis, which is strongly correlated with the radiological findings.",

The proposed local patch-based approach showed consistently better performance than global approach in all metrics. In particular, as depicted in Table XI , our method showed the sensitivity of 92.5% for COVID-19 and viruses, which was acceptable performance as a screening method, considering the fact that the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis by X-ray image is known to be 69% even for clinical experts and that the current gold standard, RT-PCR, has sensitivity of 91% [4] . Moreover, compared to the global approach, the sensitivity of other classes are significantly high, which confirms the efficacy of our method. E. Interpretability using saliency map Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 illustrate the examples of visualization of saliency map. As shown in Fig. 7(a) , the existing Grad- CAM method for global approach showed the limitation that it only focuses on the broad main lesion so that it cannot properly differentiate multifocal lesions within the image. On the other hand, with the probabilistic Grad-CAM, multifocal GGOs and consolidations were visualized effectively by our local patch-based approach as shown in Fig. 7(c) , which was in consistent with the findings reported by clinical experts. In particular, when we compute the probabilistic Grad-CAM for the COVID-19 class using patient images from various classes (i.e., normal, bacterial, TB, and COVID-19), a noticeable activation map was observed only in the COVID-19 patient data set, whereas almost no activations were observed in patients with other diseases and conditions as shown in Fig. 8 . These results strongly support our claim that the probabilistic Grad-CAM saliency map from our local patch-based approach is more intuitive and interpretable compared to the existing methods.",

As COVID-19 is spreading rapidly and surpassing the capacity of medical system in many countries, it is necessary to make reasonable decision to distribute the limited resources based on the 'triage', which determine the needs and urgency for each patient. In general, the most common cause of community acquired pneumonia is bacterial infection [5] . Specifically, most studies reported that S. pneumoniae is the most frequent causative strain (15 \u2212 42%), after which H. influenza (11 \u2212 12%) and viral pneumonia follow as the second and the third most common causes of pneumonia, respectively [5] . In addition, depending on the geological region, substantial proportion of pneumonia may be diagnosed as tuberculosis (up to 10%) [5] . Summing these up, the proportion of bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis is suspected to be still large even in this pandemic situation of COVID-19. In this respect, the disease such as bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis as well as normal condition can be excluded primarily, to preserve limited medical resources such as RT-PCR or CT only for those who suspected to be infected with COVID-19.",

Fig. 10 shows the curves for accuracy and F1 score of (a) the global approach and (b) the proposed local patchbased approach for each epoch. Note that both approaches use the same number of weight parameters. Still, thanks to the increasing training data set from the random patch cropping across all image area, our local patch-based algorithm did not showed any sign of overfitting even with the small numbers of training data, while the global approach showed significant overfitting problem.

We investigated the effects of our preprocessing step on cross-database generalization by investigating the COVID-19 dataset, which poses the most severe intra-dataset heterogeneity. As shown in Fig. 11(b) , each original CXRs of the COVID-19 class showed highly-varying intensity characteristics among each segmented anatomies. Thanks to our preprocessing step, the mean pixel intensity distribution between lung and heart regions of the preprocessed COVID-19 dataset (see Fig. 11 (c)) became similar to the normal class in Fig. 11(a) . The problem of heterogeneity can be also mitigated as shown in the intensity histograms (see Fig. 11 (d)-(f)). The results confirmed that the original COVID-19 data could be well preprocessed to have comparable intensity distribution to that of well-curated normal data. F. Segmentation network analysis 1) Comparison with U-Net: Recall that we chose FC-DenseNet103 as a backbone segmentation network architecture thanks to its higher segmentation performance with smaller number of parameters (9.4 M) [31] . To demonstrate the effectiveness of CXR segmentation by the FC-Densenet103, we trained U-Net [32] under identical training conditions and compared the results. There was no significant difference between the networks result. We further analyzed the effect of the different segmentation methods on classification performance. The proposed segmentation method with the FC-DenseNet103 resulted consistently better classification performance in all metrics than the U-Net. When compared with the FC-DenseNet67, which has smaller number of parameters (3.5 M) [15] , the performance improvement by our method is significant. Given the better trade-off between the complexity versus performance, we adopted FC-DenseNet103 as our segmentation network. 2) Effect of trainset size: To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed segmentation network with limited training dataset, we performed the ablation study by reducing training dataset size. Lung segmentation performance was evaluated on the cross-database NLM(MC) dataset. For the preprocessed NLM(MC) dataset, Jaccard similarity coefficients remain stable until 50% of trainset was used for training as shown in Table XV ; however, in the original NLM(MC) dataset without preprocessing step, segmentation performance decreased steeply as the size of trainsets decreased. This results support that proposed segmentation network endures limited training dataset size by matching intensity distribution of cross-database CXRs thanks to our preprocessing step. 3) Segmentation effects on marker analysis and classification: The proposed segmentation network was trained with normal subject set that have segmentation mask as shown Table V , XV, and showed comparable performance with the state-of-the-art for the normal subjects. However, when CXR images with severe consolidation are used, segmentation performance degradation is unavoidable, since such images have been never observed during the training.",

Our investigation showed that the under-segmentations are only outliers that are observed in some patient data set (7 of 54 bacterials cases (13%,), 2 of 57 cases for TB (3.5%), and 5 of 200 cases for COVID-19 and viral pneumonia (2.5%)), whereas no under segmentation were observed from 191 healthy subjects.",

With a separately trained neural network using only binary masks, it was possible to distinguish between normal and abnormal images with 86.9% sensitivity. This confirms that the morphology of the segmentation mask is a discriminatory biomarker between normal and the patient groups. Then, we conducted additional experiments to evaluate how classification performance is affected by excluding or including under-segmentation cases. Although the differences in other labels were not significant, the overall sensitivity for bacterial were better when the under-segmented subjects were excluded. Therefore, the under-segmentation still has some effects on the classification between the diseases.",

The results in Table XVI clearly confirmed that despite the under-segmented outliers the use of segmentation mask significantly improved the classification performance on the whole. This suggests that there are rooms to improve the performance of the proposed method, if the segmentation network could be further trained using patient cases with correct segmentation labels. G. Classification network analysis 1) Effect of patch size on the performance: To evaluate the effect of the patch size on the performance of the classification algorithm, we tested various patch sizes, such as 112 \u00d7 112, and 448\u00d7448. Using half-sized (112\u00d7112) patches, the results were worse as shown in Table XVII . With double-sized (448\u00d7 448) patches, the results were not better than those with patch size of 224 \u00d7 224, as depicted in Table XVII . In summary, there seems to be a clear drawback in reducing the patch size, and there was also no benefit with increasing the patch size. Therefore, we chose the value in between. 2) Effects of trainset size: We analyzed the effect of dataset size in terms of classification performance, since we aimed to develop the method that has the advantage of maintaining robustness even when only limited data are available. The classification performances with decreasing dataset sizes are provided in Fig. 12 . The global approach using whole image, which is similar to most classification methods, showed prominent decrease in accuracy with decreasing dataset size, but the proposed local patch-based method showed less compromised performance, showing the robustness to the reduced dataset size as shown in Fig. 12(a) . These results were more prominent when comparing them by relative scale as shown in Fig. 12(b) . ",

Once the neural network was trained, the final decision was made based on the majority voting from multiple patches at random locations within lungs. We also proposed a novel probabilistic Grad-CAM saliency map that is tailored to the local patch-based approach. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed network was trained stably with small data set, provided comparative results with the SOTA method, and generated interpretable saliency maps that are strongly correlated with the radiological findings.",
