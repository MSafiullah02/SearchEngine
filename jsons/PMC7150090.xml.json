The first two categories are represented, respectively, by the classic oral (Sabin) and injectable (Salk) poliovirus vaccines. During their initial development, it was quickly appreciated that the live-attenuated immunogen confers durable immunity against wild-type poliovirus replication in vaccinated individuals (i.e., sterilizing immunity). In contrast, the inactivated immunogen generally provides more transient protection and primarily serves to prevent the spread of poliovirus to the central nervous system, as opposed to fully preventing viral replication in the gut. These patterns are recapitulated in the responses elicited by other vaccines. For example, live-attenuated immunogens, such as measles and smallpox vaccines, provide long-term sterilizing immunity, while killed pathogen vaccines induce more transient responses that require periodic boosting.1 The differences can be at least partially attributed to the fact that live immunogens display a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that engage innate antimicrobial sensors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs).2 This contrasts with replication-incompetent immunogens, which lack these innate \u201cdanger\u201d signals and therefore induce a diminished, delayed, and less durable immune response.",

A familiar example is the tetanus toxoid vaccine, which requires periodic boosting to maintain protective levels of tetanus toxin-neutralizing antibodies. In the current review, we focus on a new class of more immunogenic subunit vaccines in which the immunogen of interest is organized into a multivalent array that resembles the surface of geometrically rigid virions. The resulting immunogens, termed \u201cvirus-like particles\u201d (VLPs), are typically composed of recombinant virion structural proteins that self-assemble into nanoparticles in the absence of viral genomic DNA or RNA. It is now well established that properly assembled VLPs can induce potent, diverse, and durable serum antibody responses that are comparable to responses against live or live-attenuated pathogens. The remarkable potency of rigidly multivalent subunit immunogens has been most comprehensively documented in studies of current commercial VLP-based vaccines against human papillomaviruses (HPVs).3., 4. An emerging view is that at least some types of VLP immunogens, including current HPV vaccines, fall into a special class of subunit vaccine that can show the same potency and durability as live-attenuated immunogens. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that VLP immunogens can even be potent enough to overcome the self-tolerance of human B cells, allowing the induction of auto-antibody responses of therapeutic interest.5., 6.\n",

For example, the commercial hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, which is comprised of VLPs assembled from the HBV surface (S) envelope protein, induces relatively poor antibody titers that decline over time.7 It may be that the S protein is arrayed in a relatively mobile and flexible way and thus fails to qualify as a geometrically rigid multivalent structure. Similar flexibility issues might explain why emerging VLP-based vaccines against Dengue virus appear not to have elicited stable high-titer neutralizing antibody responses in clinical trials.8\n",

Smaller (<500 nm) virions can passively traffic through lymphatic system and can also be directly taken up by immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Either pathway efficiently brings antigens to the lymph nodes, where adaptive immune responses can be induced. In the setting of the lymph node, successfully transported virions are taken up by specialized macrophages in the subcapsular sinus of the draining lymph node. Virions are then transferred to follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) where they are directly presented to B cells. Durable attachment to FDCs can be enhanced by decoration of the presented antigen with low affinity IgM antibodies or complement components.9 When antigen-specific surface immunoglobulins (Igs) on the B cell (B cell receptors (BCRs)) recognize the antigen, these BCRs form microclusters to promote a signaling cascade that activates the B cell. The recognized antigen can then be endocytosed and processed for presentation on an MHC class II protein, which in turn recruits the help of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.\n",

In fact, some of the few host protein complexes with 50\u2013100 \u00c5 spacing are immune gene products, such as IgM antibodies, complement component C1q, and collectins like the mannose binding lectin. Repetitive spacing can thus be seen as a type of PAMP that B cells have evolved to specifically detect via engagement of cell surface BCRs. Strong B cell responses can be elicited by other types of PAMP signals through engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or by persistent interaction with FDCs through IgM or C1q. However, the Bachmann-Zinkernagel effect operates independently of conventional adjuvant signaling. Instead, epitope spacing and rigidity appear to be the primary variable in triggering this effect.11 There is some indirect evidence that multivalent immunogens trigger a special type of signaling separate from adjuvant effects. This comes from the observation that it is extremely difficult or perhaps impossible to generate hybridomas from mice immunized with rigid virus-like particles under dosing schedules typically used for production of monoclonal antibodies.12., 4., 13.\n",

The extraordinary success of the current rigid multivalent VLP vaccines against HPV has confirmed its relevance to human populations. Participants in early trials of HPV vaccines who received only one dose of the vaccine demonstrated high titer neutralizing antibody responses that plateaued for at least six years after vaccination (Fig. 4.1\n).16., 17. Booster doses of the HPV vaccine cause only incremental increases in antibody titers. This type of response stands in dramatic contrast to more conventional immunogens, such as traditional tetanus toxoid vaccines, where booster doses trigger major, albeit temporary, rises in neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 4.2\n).18 A possible interpretation is that a given B cell\u2019s initial contact with the VLP immunogen triggers a differentiation pathway\u2014presumably mediated by IgD BCRs\u2014that predisposes the cell to expand and differentiate into a set of long-lived plasma cells that reside in the bone marrow without necessarily passing through a durable memory B cell phenotype.",

Rhinoviruses collectively cause 70% of mild upper respiratory infections in humans. Although there are at least 100 known rhinovirus serotypes, it may eventually be possible to construct a panel of recombinant rhinovirus VLPs for inclusion of a multi-VLP vaccine analogous to the nine-serotype HPV VLP vaccine. Based on the assumption that a multi-VLP rhinovirus vaccine immunogen would, like HPV VLP vaccines, elicit at least some degree of cross-neutralization of rhinovirus serotypes not contained in the vaccine, this approach could theoretically offer broad protection against the common cold. The project could serve to pave the way for the development of VLP-based vaccines against viruses in the Picornaviridae family, including emerging pathogens such as EV68, which has been associated with flaccid paralysis.\n",

Structural studies of dengue virions and VLPs indicate that E can exist in a range of highly distinct conformations. A major conformational shift is triggered by proteolysis of the PrM by the cellular protease furin. Structure-guided design and engineering of more complete proteolysis of recombinant dengue VLPs might result in more rigid display of a uniformly \u201cmature\u201d herringbone configuration of E proteins, thereby more effectively triggering the Backmann-Zinkernagel effect. The initial work that revealed the Bachmann-Zinkernagel effect relied on use of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) model system. Like other members of the viral family Rhabdoviridae, the surface envelope glycoprotein (G) of VSV is not icosahedrally ordered. VSV G is, however, arrayed at very high density on the bullet-shaped surface of the virion. This suggests that strict geometric rigidity is not necessarily required to trigger the Bachmann-Zinkernagel effect and that other forms of extremely high-density polyvalency can suffice.",

            "text": "Viral capsids were the first and now the most widely used nanoparticle scaffolds for displaying antigens of interest in a rigid multivalent array. In one of its earliest uses in 1987, VLPs assembled from the core protein of hepatitis B virus (HBcAg) were able to display an exogeneous foot-and-mouse disease virus (FMDV) epitope.30 The ~27 nm HBcAg particles were able to elicit FMDV-specific immune responses in animals at a substantially higher magnitude compared to responses elicited by a nonnanoparticulate \u03b2-galactosidase scaffold or free peptide epitope alone. Since then, as structural biology and biochemical techniques have continued to mature, other viral capsids and proteins have been utilized to display various epitopes and protein antigens.6 One advantage of using viral capsids, such as HBcAg or bacteriophage-derived capsid proteins, is that the VLP can be produced in high-yield bacterial expression systems that are easily scalable for vaccine manufacturing. Typically, the extension of genes or insertion of exogeneous target antigen is limited in these platforms by either size, shape, orientation of the antigen, or a combination of these factors. Thus, it is often difficult to display larger antigens, such an entire viral envelope protein. For example, the HBcAg is a versatile platform to present some relatively large proteins but proper nanoparticle assembly is disrupted if the N- and C-termini of the antigen of interest are too distant from one another. This problem has been partially resolved by introducing enzymatic cleavage sites near the HBcAg-insertion site, thereby releasing one terminus of the insert and relaxing the core protein scaffold to allow particle assembly.31\n",

Multiple VLP systems have used this technology to conjugate exogeneous antigens on to the surface of particles. The method is especially powerful if the antigen of interest requires a specific tertiary or quaternary structure, disulfide bond formation or glycosylation or other posttranslational modifications to elicit the desired immune response. Conjugation of the antigen to an acceptor scaffold allows separate expression of the scaffold and the antigen in heterologous expression and purification systems. The efficiency of chemical conjugation varies for different systems as the distribution, occupancy and orientation of the antigen on the scaffold surface can be difficult to control. These factors can be partly manipulated by conjugation conditions (i.e., concentration of antigen and scaffold) or genetic design (restricting the number of reactive residues on both scaffold and antigen). Recently, an alternative conjugation technique has been described on the P22 bacteriophage capsid system, in which an adaptor protein called Dec (decoration protein) is used to link the target antigen to the particle scaffold.32 The Dec protein assembles into trimers so that it can, in principle, be attached to trimeric proteins such as influenza HA, HIV-1 envelope, Ebola virus glycoprotein, RSV fusion protein or coronavirus spike proteins. Another recent study reports use of the Streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin binding protein-based SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for predictable covalent linkage of antigens.33 One of the earliest but now well-established systems made use of chemical conjugation of biotin to an HPV VLP scaffold surface, thereby allowing tetrameric streptavidin to serve as a \u201cbridge\u201d to display a biotinylated protein antigen.11\n",

Both types of antigen-nanoparticles elicited similar magnitudes of humoral response to the EBV antigen, suggesting that nanoparticle size did not significantly affect immunogenicity in this context.29\nThe encapsulin platform has also been engineered to encapsidate proteins in the lumen of the nanoparticle by attaching a specific signal sequence on the encapsidated proteins.35 This accentuates the potential for creating nanoparticulate vaccine immunogens that deliver encapsidated adjuvant molecules, such as co-stimulatory molecules or TLR agonists. These proteinaceous nanoparticles can be made in mammalian cells by simply introducing a secretion signal sequence. The secreted subunit protein (and fused antigen) can spontaneously self-assemble into nanoparticles in the milieu of the ER lumen and be purified as nanoparticles from culture supernatant by straightforward chromatography techniques. An advantage of this approach is that the fused antigen of interest can fold properly and acquire a natural pattern of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is known to be critical for proper folding of many viral envelope proteins. Many additional classes of nanoparticles remain to be explored as vaccine antigen display scaffolds. Some examples of unexplored areas in this discipline include bacterial microcompartment complexes as scaffolds36 and vertebrate immune system components that recognize multivalent antigens. The latter may include complement component C1q, IgM, mannose binding protein (MBP) or related highly oligomeric lectins. These vertebrate-derived scaffolds might have the advantage of persisting on FDCs or other immune cells that have specific receptors for C1q, IgM, or MBP.",
