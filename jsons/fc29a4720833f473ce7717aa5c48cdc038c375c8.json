Previously, on the 14 th of February, the first COVID-19 autopsy in Spain had been performed in the Hospital Arnau de Vilanova-Lliria, Valencia; however, the virological diagnosis had been made subsequent to the post-mortem examination (1). On March 13 th a state of emergency was declared in Spain and the Ministry of Health recommended that autopsies should only be performed under conditions that fulfilled security measures and that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should be obligatory. Due to the initial difficult situation in the majority of hospitals, no autopsies of COVID-19 patients were carried out during March or the beginning of April. Not only was there a shortage of PPE, many autopsy rooms were being used as morgues. However, the situation improved and by mid-April clinicians began requesting autopsy studies. We describe the implementation of a COVID-19 Autopsy program in the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal University Hospital in Madrid and the results of the first autopsy. As the main target organ in severe COVID-19 disease is the lung, we also reviewed the reports published to date of lung pathology in these patients.",

An ad-hoc medical committee (COVID-19 Committee) selected autopsies from possible cases and the coordinator of the committee requested the post-mortem. The number of autopsies, when possible, should be limited to 1 or 2 per day. The autopsy room ventilation was adapted ( Fig. 1 A and B) in order to guarantee more than 12 air changes per hour and confirm negative pressure in the room. In addition, the aspiration system of the autopsy table was checked. Air was expelled from the autopsy room to the exterior through a High Efficiency Particulate Air filter. Appropriate PPE were obtained (Table 1) , according to the recommendations of the hospital Occupational Risk Prevention Service (Fig. 1C) . The personnel involved in the autopsy procedure attended a special two-hour course given by the Preventive Medicine Service.",

He suffered a pulmonary thromboembolism and died after 25 days in Intensive Care. His next of kin authorized the necropsy. Autopsy procedure workflow Two clear areas were delimited inside the autopsy room, a dirty area containing the dissection table and a clean area ( Figure 1A ). Personnel entered via the clean area and left via the dirty area. The corpse was brought in through the dirty area. All personnel dressed in an adjacent room and entered the autopsy room fully clad in PPE (figure 1B). The autopsy was performed by two pathologists with the assistance of one technician. A pathology resident, working in the clean area, was in charge of collecting samples and also helped to disrobe participating personnel after the procedure.",

Microscopically, samples from two different areas of each lobe were studied. Airspaces were reduced due to an increase in the interstitial connective tissue. Histological changes varied, in the best-preserved areas, which represented about 10% of the parenchyma studied, there was minimal septal thickening with capillary congestion, occasional mononuclear inflammatory infiltration and evident alveolar cell desquamation. AE1/AE3 and CD68 immunostaining demonstrated that most desquamated cells were epithelial, although some macrophages were also present. Pneumocytes were hyperplastic and showed cytopathic-like changes, such as multinucleation, prominent nucleolus and granular cytoplasm ( Fig. 2A) . In addition to previous described changes, approximately 10% of the lung parenchyma analysed showed hyaline membranes, indicating the exudative stage of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (Fig. 2A) . The most extensive pattern of lung lesions was consistent with DAD in proliferative (organizing) (70%) and fibrotic (10%) stages. There was intense septal thickening with abundant reactive fibroblasts (Fig 2B  and C) . Interstitial inflammatory infiltrates were scarce and mainly composed of CD8+ lymphocytes with inconspicuous neutrophils. There were abundant thrombi in both medium-and small-sized blood vessels, which were observed in all 10 histological sections analysed. Thrombi in all locations showed CD61 expression indicating their platelet composition (Fig. 2D) . Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies did not reveal the presence of any further infectious pathogen. Some Von Kossa positive calcium deposits were found in both alveolar spaces and septum.",

As high-risk autopsies are not frequently performed in most Pathology Departments in Spain, training in the use of specific PPE is highly recommended previous to carrying out this type of autopsy.

A summary of the major clinicopathological findings are presented in Table 2 . In some cases, the authors describe pneumonic changes similar to those we observed in less affected areas of the lung in our patient. In this phase, the presence of cells with cytopathic changes was evident. In most previously reported cases, the lesions were consistent with DAD in the exudative and, less frequently, the proliferative/organizing phase. Our case showed all the spectrum of DAD from the early exudative phase to extensive fibrosis, suggesting a continuous viral effect on the lung throughout the clinical course of the disease. One previous, brief report found acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia as the main feature in four out of five biopsies. In a preliminary analysis of 10 autopsies performed in our hospital (in preparation), two patients showed this type of lesion, which had been previously reported in 30% of autopsies from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to SARS-CoV infection (18, 19) . Whether or not this is a specific lesion of a pattern of tissue organization in the context of DAD, or its possible clinical relevance, remain to be seen. Another frequent finding in previous reports was the presence of vascular thrombi in blood vessels of different size. The only reports in which this finding is not observed were those based on the study of biopsies, where sampling is more limited. It is controversial whether COVID-19 patients present a higher hypercoagulability status than other critical conditions, which could explain these findings. However, it should be noted that vascular thrombosis is an integral component of DAD and we did not observe vascular thrombosis elsewhere.",
