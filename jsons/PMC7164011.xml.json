These glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST)\u2010fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cell strain for overexpression. The results demonstrated that 15 single\u2010, one triple\u2010, ND(\u03941\u20105) and LHD(\u0394293\u2010306) were well expressed and soluble while the CD(\u0394278\u2010306); LR(276\u2013290/2G) and LR(276\u2013290/4G) were not expressable. The cells carrying these three constructs grew much slower, indicating that the mutant proteins with the loop deleted might be toxic to cells, probably due to severe aggregation or amyloid formation. The expressed GST\u2010fusion proteins were purified by using the glutathione Sepharose affinity column and the pure mutated 3CL proteases were further obtained by in\u2010gel thrombin\u2010cleavage followed by FPLC gel\u2010filtration purification. The SDS/PAGE gel and MALDI\u2010TOF mass checking indicated that all recombinant proteins purified by this procedure were homogenous and intact (data not shown).",

Figure 1 presents the enzymatic activity profiles for the wild\u2010type and 18 mutated proteases in the assay buffer without NaCl. Based on this, the mutated proteases could be divided into four groups. The first group includes Glu288A, Asp289A, Glu290A, Arg298A, Gln299A, ND and LCD which showed dramatic losses of activities and retained < 10% of the wild\u2010type proteolytic activity. The second group contains Asn214Ala, Leu282Ala and Cys300Ala which had significant activity decreases but still preserve > 30% of the wild\u2010type activity while the third group consists of Thr280Ala, Gly283Ala and Ser301Ala which had no significant activity differences from the wild\u2010type protease. Very interestingly, the replacement of residues Ser284, Thr285, Ile286 or Phe291 by Ala gave rise to the mutated proteases with enzymatic activities higher than that of the wild\u2010type. Therefore, we constructed a triple\u2010mutant with three\u2010neighbouring residues Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 all mutated to Ala and strikingly this led to a \u2018super\u2010active\u2019 SARS 3C\u2010like protease (SARS 3CLp) which possessed a 3.7\u2010fold enhanced activity. As such, we placed Ser284Ala, Thr285Ala, Ile286A, Phe291 and the super\u2010active mutants together as the fourth group.",

As shown in Fig. 2, the super\u2010active mutant had an apparent molecular mass almost identical to that of the wild\u2010type protease. However, the apparent molecular masses of the mutated proteases in the first group were, on average, \u2248 22 kDa smaller than that of the wild\u2010type (56.3 kDa). This observation strongly suggested that these residues play an important role in the enzyme dimerization. Here it is particularly interesting to note that Asn214Ala which still retained \u2248 30% of the wild\u2010type proteolytic activity had a small apparent molecular mass (32.6 kDa), indicating that Asn214Ala had a dominant tendency to form a monomer. Therefore, at least four regions of the SARS 3CLp might be significantly associated with enzyme dimerization: (1) the N\u2010terminal residues 1\u20135 as previously identified [21, 22]; (2) the residue Asn214; (3) the region around residues Glu288\u2010Asp289\u2010Glu290 which had a close contact with the N\u2010terminus [21, 22]; and (4) the C\u2010terminal last helix region around residues Arg298\u2013Gln299. Moreover, introduction of higher concentrations of NaCl statistically had no disrupting effect on enzyme dimerization (data not shown), indicating that the reduced activities in the presence of NaCl (Fig. 1) were not due to the disruption of dimerization.",

As indicated in Fig. 4A\u2013D, similar to the wild\u2010type protease, all mutants gave rise to several NMR resonance peaks at a very upfield region (\u22121.1 to 0.5 p.p.m), indicating that they may own well\u2010packed tertiary structures. A detailed examination of the NMR spectra revealed that the mutants in the first group plus Asn214Ala had spectra with sharper resonance peaks than the wild\u2010type protease, consistent with the observation that these mutants had significantly smaller average relative molecular mass than the wild\u2010type because the NMR resonance peak width is size\u2010dependent and a larger protein will give rise to broader NMR peaks due to the short T2 (transverse relaxation time) [23, 24]. Interestingly, regardless of the DLS relative molecular mass, all mutant proteases gave rise to one but not two sets of upfield resonance peaks similar to the wild\u2010type, indicating that the monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium is a fast exchange process on the NMR time scale [23, 24].",

As seen in Fig. 5A, the HSQC spectrum of the wild\u2010type protease are very broad and only a small portion of resonance peaks are visible, consistent with our previous report [19]. This is mostly due to the very large relative molecular mass for the wild\u2010type protease in a dimmer\u2010dominant state. Interestingly, the STI/A mutant had a HSQC spectrum (Fig. 5B) very similar to that of the wild\u2010type, indicating that both STI/A and wild\u2010type proteases shared similar structural and dimerization properties. On the other hand, Arg298Ala and ND mutants which were shown by DLS to have a monomer\u2010like relative molecular mass (Fig. 2) had very\u2010dispersed HSQC spectra with many resonance peaks detectable (Figs 5C and E). This observation indicates that the two mutants were in monomer\u2010dominant states which were also well\u2010structured [25, 26, 27]. When our manuscript was under a previous review, a paper was published in which both ND and LHD mutants were demonstrated to have a great tendency to form a monomer by analytic ultracentrifuge analysis [28]. Interestingly, although here the LHD mutant also had a well\u2010dispersed HSQC spectrum (Fig. 5D), the visible HSQC resonance peaks were less than those of Arg298Ala and ND mutants. Therefore, in the current case, it appears that the HSQC line\u2010width was modulated both by the average relative molecular mass resulting from fast intermolecular monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium as well as by intramolecular conformational exchanges. It is very likely that although the LHD mutant had a dominant tendency to form a monomer [28], the deletion of the last helix may provoke \u00b5s\u2013ms conformational exchanges to some degree which caused some HSQC peaks too broad to be clearly distinguished from the noise signals. However, if the HSQC spectral level was lowered, it could be found that most HSQC peaks of the ND, Glu288Ala, Glu290Ala, Arg298Ala, Gln299Ala, LHD and STI/A are almost superimposable to those of the wild\u2010type protease, as exemplified by Fig. 5F in which the HSQC spectra of the Arg298Ala and wild\u2010type proteases were superimposed at a lower spectral level. These results, together with CD spectra, indicated that very likely \u2212 over the well\u2010packed regions such as chymotrypsin\u2010fold and the C\u2010terminal extra domain \u2212 no dramatic change occurred for the secondary structures and tertiary structures upon mutation or deletion. However, certainly the mutation and deletion resulted in minor structural changes as well as conformational exchanges on the \u00b5s\u2013ms time scale to different degrees which consequently made some HSQC too broad to be detected, as we recently discovered on the CHABII molecule [25, 26].",

By a protein dissection approach, we first demonstrated the critical role of the extra domain in both dimerization and activity of the SARS 3CLp [19]. Because dimerization was extensively considered to be essential for enzymatic activity [20], more investigations have been directed towards understanding the dimerization\u2013activity relationship of the SARS 3CLp [22, 28, 37]. Recently the role of the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal residues in dimerization has been assessed by analytic ultracentrifugation analysis [28]. Strikingly, in this report [28], two mutated proteases exactly corresponding to our ND and LHD mutants were both demonstrated by analytic ultracentrifuge analysis to have a great tendency to form a monomer.",

More strikingly, our study has revealed that the mutant Asn214Ala still retained \u2248 30% activity although it had a tendency similar to ND and LHD to form a monomer (according to our results to the monomer\u2013dimer distribution study of ND and LHD mutants) [28]. This result implies that the relationship between dimerization and activity might be very complex and needs to be carefully addressed in the future. If the residues critical for dimerization were mapped back to the dimeric structure of the SARS 3CLp, a very interesting picture is observed. As seen in Fig. 6A, the dimerization regions are clustered together to form a tertiary packing core in the middle of the dimeric enzyme. In fact in the core region, only two direct intermonomer contacts exist, namely between Glu290 of one protomer and Arg4 of another. Indeed, the importance of the Arg4\u2013Glu290 interaction in dimerization has been reported previously [22]. The role of the identified residues other than Arg4 and Glu290 in dimerization might be in maintaining the correct side\u2010chain conformations of the residues Glu290 and Arg4 by interacting with them. Indeed, within the same protomer, Asn214 has close contacts with Phe3 and Gln299 while Glu288 closely contacts to Lys5. Alternatively, some newly identified residues might contribute to dimerization by interacting with other nonextra\u2010domain residues which are not explored in the present study. It is also of note that although the dimerization interface appears relatively large, a single\u2010mutation in particular on Asn214, Glu288, Asp289, Arg298 or Gln299 is sufficient to significantly disrupt enzyme dimerization.",

Based on this observation, a super\u2010active mutant with a 3.7\u2010fold enhancement of proteolytic activity was engineered by mutating three residues Ser284\u2013Thr285\u2013Ile286 to Ala. As judged from the DLS results and NMR HSQC spectra, the triple\u2010mutant has structural and dimerization properties similar to those of the wild\u2010type protease. This observation strongly implies that in addition to dimerization, the extra domain might have other mechanisms for regulating the catalytic machinery.

This raises a very interesting question as to how these regions can achieve regulation of the catalytic machinery which is far away. Possibly, the slight but long\u2010range alterations of structure and dynamics of the enzyme, as well as enzyme\u2013solvent interactions upon mutation could account for the observed regulatory effects. As seen in Fig. 6A and B the majority of the dimerization residues plus Phe291, Ser284\u2013Thr285\u2013Ile286 are clustered together to form a molecular channel passing through the middle region of the enzyme. Owing to its molecular\u2010scale size, we thus call it a nano\u2010channel which has a diameter of \u224812 \u00c5 and a surface area of \u2248 360 \u00c52, with the up\u2010wall length of \u2248 18 \u00c5 and bottom\u2010wall length of \u2248 7 \u00c5. The upper wall of the channel appears to have connectivity to the inner cavities while the two ends of the channel are also further connected to the surface cavities of the enzyme molecule which eventually lead to the active\u2010site pockets. Interestingly Ala mutations of the residues Ser284\u2013Thr285\u2013Ile286 which significantly enhanced catalytic activity would remove the bottom wall of the channel. Based on this, we thus speculate that this channel might serve as a regulator sitting in the central region of the enzyme, and play a role in relaying the regulatory effect from the extra domain to the catalytic machinery. Certainly, the future determination of the high\u2010resolution structures of the mutant proteases such as ND, Arg298Ala, Asn214 and super\u2010active mutant STI/A may shed light on the molecular mechanism as to why dimerization is critical for the activity of the wild\u2010type protease as well as to why Ala mutations of Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity.",

Thus, we selected one deposited crystallographic structure of the SARS 3CLp (PDB code: 1Q2W) as a template, and subsequently added hydrogen atoms to the structure using graphic software yasara (http://www.yasara.org). A TCL/TK script was prepared to calculate the distances between the residues of the extra\u2010domain and those on another protomer. Consequently a total of 15 residues were listed out including Asn214, Thr280, Leu282, Gly283, S284, Thr285, Ile286, Glu288, Asp289, Glu290, Phe291, Arg298, Gln299, Cys300 and Ser301. Since a closer examination of the 3D structures including 1Q2W and other [21] revealed that both N\u2010 and C\u2010termini had a large number of contacts with the 15 selected residues, we generated three N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal deletion constructs, namely ND(\u03941\u20105) with N\u2010terminal residues 1\u20135 deleted; LHD(\u0394293\u2010306) with the last helix (residues 293\u2013306) deleted; CD(\u0394278\u2010306) with the C\u2010terminal residues 278\u2013306 deleted. Moreover, the examination also indicated extensive contacts between the loop regions (residues 276\u2013290) on the two protomers, we also made two loop\u2010replacement constructs, with the loop residues 276\u2013290 replaced by two Gly residues for LR(276\u2013290/2G) and by four Gly residues for LR(276\u2013290/4G).",
