The most common pathogens causing influenza in humans are type A influenza viruses (seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1 and H3N2) and type B influenza viruses. Conventional treatments against the disease include two classes of antivirals: M2 ion channel blockers adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir and laninamivir) (Ison, 2011; Lee and Yen, 2012) . These two categories are designed to target viral proteins, thereby interfering with the virus' infection mechanisms. However, the emergence of new influenza viral strains carrying drug resistant mutations that can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals pre-sents a major clinical challenge. Most circulating influenza A viruses show resistance to adamantanes (Ison, 2011; Jackson et al., 2011; Lee and Yen, 2012; Moscona, 2009) , and intrinsic resistance to the compound has also been observed in Influenza B (Ison, 2011) . In addition, beginning with the 2007-2008 influenza season, circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses possessing the oseltamivir resistance mutation (His275Tyr) have been observed (Lackenby et al., 2008) . Since the first reported case of pandemic H1N1 in 2009, oseltamivir-resistant variant strains have also been identified (Baz et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2009; Speers et al., 2010; Storms et al., 2012) .

By including an old v-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, as a control in two key functional assays, a similar cellular mechanism of action between diphyllin and bafilomycin A1 was observed. A wide variety of structurally inhibitors have been discovered, including benzolactone enamides salicylihalamide, lobatamide A and B, apicularen, indolyls, oximidine, macrolactone archazolid, lobatamide C, cruentaren, diphyllin and recently reported synthetic compounds, such as FR202126 and SB 242784 (Huss and Wieczorek, 2009; Niikura, 2006; Perez-Sayans et al., 2009 ). Many of these v-ATPase inhibitors have been previously evaluated for their antiviral activity against influenza viruses (Guinea and Carrasco, 1995; Muller et al., 2011; Ochiai et al., 1995) , rhinoviruses (Suzuki et al., 2001) , and dengue viruses (Duan et al., 2008) . Even though some of the classical v-ATPase inhibitors exhibited potent inhibitory effect against influenza viruses, the high toxicity of these compounds made them unsuitable for clinical applications (Drose and Altendorf, 1997; Niikura, 2006) . In Muller's study (2011) , for instance, bafilomycin A1 showed limited therapeutic efficacy in vivo despite significant viral inhibition in vitro. Implicated to have an unselective action mechanism, bafilomycin A1 exhibited high toxicity and inflicted liver and spleen damages at a 350 ng/kg. In contrast, a structurally distinctive saliphenylhalamide, demonstrated effective in vivo antiviral effect in mice and was well tolerated at a dose of 7 mg/kg. The improved antiviral effect/toxicity profile of saliphenylhalamide was attributed to a more selective v-ATPase inhibiting mechanism and highlights a major factor for consideration in therapeutic applications of v-ATPase inhibitors. Regarding diphyllin in the present study, compound safety has been demonstrated in a previous report (Shen et al., 2011) , in which daily treatment in mice at a dose of 20 mg/kg was tolerated for 10 days without significant signs of toxicity. Structurally, both saliphenylhalamide and diphyllin fall into the class of benzolactones. It should be noted, however, that saliphenylhalamide is a lactone of salicylic acid, and diphyllin is a lactone of naphthoic acid, and saliphenylhalamide contains a macrocyclic N-acyl enamine functional group that has been shown to be required for potent v-ATPase activity (Lebreton et al., 2008) , whereas diphyllin has no such functional group. Owing to the multiple isoforms of v-ATPase expressed in a tissuespecific manner (Toei et al., 2010) , the therapeutic usefulness of v-ATPase inhibitors relies on the selectivity in the inhibition (Niikura, 2006) . Although the tissue or isoforms specific inhibition of diphyllin has yet been determined, diphyllin in this study demonstrates a safe therapeutic window in two types of mammalian cell lines with IC 50 values against viruses in the nanomolar range (38-632 nM), and the cellular cytotoxicity in the micromolar range (3-24 lM), suggesting a potential role for further in vivo studies.

The combinatorial effect of diphyllin was also studied by combining a commercially available NA inhibitor (oseltamivir) or an M2 ion channel blocker (amantadine) with diphyllin. The combination of diphyllin and amantadine showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on both the virus expression and the CPE protection. Given that amantadine functions by inhibiting a proton-pump on viral antigens (Ciampor et al., 1992) , thereby regulating vesicular pH in an analogous fashion to diphyllin, the cooperativity between amantadine and diphyllin is presumably due to a more complete inhibition of endosomal acidification that occurred when the two drugs were combined. On the other hand, since diphyllin takes effect at an early stage of the replication cycle (virus fusion/uncoating) while oseltamivir takes effect at a later stage of the replication cycle (release of virons from infected cells), combining these two drugs was hypothesized to result in a synergistic action. As expected, viral protein expression and HA titer were significantly reduced when combinations of these two drugs were given as compared to single-drug treatments. Enhanced activity of oseltamivir on CPE protection was also observed in combination with diphyllin. It was reported that cell-based assays had less advantages than the direct enzymatic measurement of NA for monitoring susceptibility to the NA inhibitors (Tisdale, 2000) . In our experimental setting, however, we aimed to compare the combinatorial effect of diphyllin with the NA inhibitor, rather than to measure the susceptibility of viruses to certain NA inhibitors. Moreover, due to the different sensitivity of assay methods utilized in this study, the doses of compound combinations were pre-optimized to reflect a dynamic range that demonstrated appreciable interactions between the different compounds.
