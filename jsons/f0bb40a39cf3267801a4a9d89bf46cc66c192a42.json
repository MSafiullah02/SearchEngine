            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common chronic demyelinating disease of unknown etiology, which leads to the development of irreversible disability [Noseworthy et al., 2000] . Genetic, immunological, and environmental factors, such as viruses, have been considered for many decades as possible etiologic agents of MS. Many laboratories have searched, over the years, for a unique virus responsible for MS. More recently, this search has shifted toward ubiquitous viruses that might trigger the onset of the disease in individuals predisposed genetically. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a T cell lymphotropic herpesvirus with high seroprevalence in healthy adults, and it has been reported to infect also cells from the nervous system [Clark, 2000] . More importantly, the presence of HHV-6 was demonstrated recently in the plaques of MS tissue [Challoner et al., 1995] . After this initial observation, several other reports have been published both in favor or against the association between HHV-6 and multiple sclerosis [Soldan et al., 1997 Ablashi et al., 1998; Coates and Bell, 1998; Fillet et al., 1998; Jacobson et al., 1998; Mayne et al., 1998; Enbom et al., 1999; Akhyani et al., 2000; Knox et al., 2000] .",

It has been suggested that molecular mimicry between microbial and self-antigens could be an underlying triggering event that leads to the activation of autoreactive T cells in MS as in other autoimmune diseases [Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995] . This hypothesis has been proposed in the case of infection by human coronavirus, which has been shown to activate T cells cross-reacting with myelin basic protein in MS patients [Talbot et al., 1996] . Similarly, following infection with another ubiquitous virus, HHV-6, myelin basic protein-reactive T cells could be generated, based on epitope similarity between cellular and viral antigens [Steinman and Oldstone, 1997; Gautam et al., 1998 ]. This point has yet to be addressed experimentally. Therefore, virus-myelin cross-reactive T cells were sought in HHV-6 seropositive MS patients, and whether these cells were expressed preferentially compared to healthy seropositive controls.",

Following HHV-6 stimulation, patients and controls gave rise to T cell lines at the same rate (68%, as calculated from data in Table II ). Following Myelin Basic Protein stimulation, a higher, but again similar percentage of patients and controls responded to the stimulus (81 and 80%). To compare the degree of cross-reactivity to viral antigens and myelin in MS patients and healthy controls, all T cell lines established following stimulation with either antigen were challenged against the cross-reacting antigen. The results shown in Table II can be summarized as follows: (1) cross-reacting T cell lines were generated more frequently from MS patients (45 out of 124, 36.2%) than from controls (27 out of 104, 25.9%). Parallel conclusions were drawn in an earlier report from experiments using human Coronavirus 229E [Talbot et al., 1996] . The preferential occurrence of cross-reacting T cell lines in MS may be explained partially by the sustained T-cell mediated responsiveness found in the disease [Noseworthy et al., 2000] . (2) Within the MS group, cross-reacting T cell lines were generated more easily following Myelin Basic Protein stimulation (40 vs. 33%), whereas the viral extract was a better stimulus in controls (29 vs. 21%). (3) MS patients and controls differ significantly in giving rise to cross-reacting cell lines following Myelin Basic Protein stimulation (40 vs. 21%, P < 0.05).",

            "text": "The finding that cross-reacting T cell lines are recruited more easily following stimulation with myelin basic protein in MS than in controls, can be explained by the specific relevance that this antigen plays in the disease. The recent observation on the encephalitogenic activity of other myelin proteins such as the myelinassociated glycoprotein and the oligondendrocytespecific glycoprotein [Morris-Downes et al., 2002] supports further the relevance of these proteins and suggests additional studies. Moreover, the observation that T cells cross-reacting with HHV-6 and Myelin Basic Protein can be found in both MS patients and healthy controls is in agreement with the accepted notion that cross-reactivity between microbial and self antigens is a frequent event [Van Noort et al., 2000] . The difference in cross-reactivity between patients and controls is not as high as that found by other researchers for human coronavirus and Myelin Basic Protein [Talbot et al., 1996] , implying the need to study more patients and controls, but it could still indicate that a second ubiquitous human virus may contribute to the activation of autoreactive T cells directed against myelin components in MS. However, the question of whether there is a causative relationship between microbial infections and autoimmune responses to myelin antigens has yet to be solved. Molecular mimicry is one of the most attractive mechanistic hypothesis and our data, although consistent with this hypothesis, showing no differences in the percentage of crossreactivity between patients and controls, do not support molecular mimicry as being the major mechanism responsible for the onset of MS.",
