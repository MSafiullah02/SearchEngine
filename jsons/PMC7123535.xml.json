Here comes the example of Hannibal (from Carthago), leading the ships of Prussia I, king of Bithynia (West Turkey) in a battle of year 184 B.C. against Eumene II (Attalides, Pergamon); he won that naval battle because he managed to throw canisters full of reptiles at the enemy ships, causing terror and uncoordinated reactions leading to his victory. He therefore used fear as a weapon: snakes were not even harmful (not poisonous), but big was the surprise and reactions were out of control!(d)In recent history, we can see that First World War (also named the war of Chemistry) contributed to the development and use of Nervine gases, chemical weapons banned everywhere but still existing in some countries. The Second World War (also named the war of Physics) led to the development and use of the atomic bomb.\n",

The basic question is: when will the new pandemic strike? Sometimes soon, as international experts say. The so called \u201cAvian flu\u201d came close to that, but sometime in the future new mutations may emerge with the potential of being much worse.",
