It provides good respiratory support in the moderately ill patient in the earlier stages of the disease.19 These patients can still breath well on their own but remain significantly hypoxic despite conventional treatment. The helmet can be fitted at this stage. It provides a significant increase in inspired oxygen with up to 10 cm H20 CPAP through adaption with a traditional CPAP machine or wall oxygen regulated by a simple device. It further enables patient self-proning to improve oxygenation, which limits the need for multiple personnel to perform this in the intubated patient The helmet allows for a safe means of containing droplet and aerosolization of virus particles by the use of a heat moisture exchange (HME) filter on the inspiratory and expiratory limb of the helmet. The comfort of the helmet also limits the need for sedation and subsequent inotropic support when compared to endotracheal intubation. With the use of the helmet, the need for rapid early intubation can often safely be delayed while a patient is observed carefully for any improvement in disease or deterioration in their condition. This may enable endotracheal intubation to be avoided in a subset of patients.",

            "text": "Previous data supports the use of helmet CPAP as a safe and effective evidence-based approach to respiratory failure. An independent metanalysis, inclusive of four randomized clinical trials in Italy, found helmet CPAP to be a beneficial mode of respiratory support when used for the correct indication. Helmet CPAP significantly increased the PaO2/FiO2 [weighted mean difference (WMD)=73.40, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 43.92 to 102.87, p<0.00001], and decreased arterial carbon dioxide levels (WMD=-1.92, 95% CI: -3.21 to -0.63, p=0.003), intubation rate [relative risk (RR)=0.21, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.40, p<0.00001], and in-hospital mortality rate (RR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.50, p=0.0004) in 4 studies that included 377 patients.29 Due to the diverse clinical diagnoses and variations in the timing of blood gas analysis in the studies, the authors recommended further large randomized controlled trials to test the outcome of the CPAP helmet for hARF more rigorously.24\n,\n30, 31, 32, 33 A single center randomized clinical trial of 83 patients with ARDS requiring NIV was conducted in the medical ICU at the University of Chicago between October 3, 2012, through September 21, 2015. Patients were randomized to receive CPAP via helmet or a face mask. The trial was terminated early because the helmet arm was found to be superior. The intubation rate was 61.5% (n = 24) for the face mask group and 18.2% (n = 8) for the helmet group (absolute difference, -43.3%; 95% CI, -62.4% to -24.3%; P < .001). The number of ventilator-free days was also significantly higher in the helmet group (28 vs 12.5, P < .001). At 90 days, 15 patients (34.1%) in the helmet group died compared with 22 patients (56.4%) in the face mask group (absolute difference, -22.3%; 95% CI, -43.3 to -1.4; P = .02). Adverse events included 3 interface-related skin ulcers for each group (ie, 7.6% in the face mask group had nose ulcers and 6.8% in the helmet group had neck ulcers).25 A further systematic review in 2016 that included 11 studies involving 621 patients, found that the overall hospital mortality was 17.53 % in the helmet NIV group versus 30.67 % in the control group. Use of the helmet CPAP was associated with lower hospital mortality (OR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.69, p=0.0005), intubation rate (OR 0.32, 95 % CI 0.21 to 0.47, P<0.00001), and complications (OR 0.6, 95 % CI 0.4 to 0.92, P=0.02). In contrast, there was no significant difference in gas exchange and ICU stay (P >0.05). Subgroup analysis found the helmet reduced mortality mainly in hARF patients (P<0.05) and a lower intubation rate was shown. Additionally, the effect of the helmet on PaCO2 was influenced by type of ARF and ventilation mode (P <0.00001).29 The authors in this study concluded that NIV with a helmet was associated with reduced hospital mortality and endotracheal intubation requirement. The helmet was as effective as the mask in gas exchange with no additional advantage. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more robust evidence.29\n",

If observed, the patient should undergo endotracheal intubation because any increased work of breathing and the generation of excessive negative intrathoracic pressure to move air has been shown to cause a self-inflicted lung injury (SILI).14\n,\n35 Determining patient breathing effort during progression of respiratory disease is not always easy. To more precisely quantify patient breathing work effort, esophageal manometry although not commonly used, may be needed in these patients to measure the generation of changes in intrathoracic pressure .34 Esophageal pressure changes of 5 to 10 cmH2O may be well tolerated. However, if an esophageal pressure change greater than 15 cmH2O is generated, the risk of self-inflicted lung injury (SILI) is increased and endotracheal intubation should be performed promptly.14 If endotracheal intubation is delayed in this situation, and a further sudden clinical deterioration occurs, it can be associated with hypoxemia, cardiovascular collapse and an emergent endotracheal intubation may be required, which puts the HCW team at risk during the MAGP.6\n,\n7\n,\n36 Naturally it is not practical to monitor respiratory effort with manometry in a pandemic situation.",

            "text": "The first helmet prototypes were developed in 1991 by Maurizio Borsari. One of the problems with CPAP helmets available in other parts of the world is that they are not all FDA approved and most U.S. physicians are unfamiliar with the helmet. (Figure 1\n) However, the concept and fitting of the mask is relatively simple. Patients typically can sit up or lie down on some pillows. It is likely that the CPAP helmet NIV, is best used in the early phase of the disease or during recovery after extubation. The CPAP helmet consists of a transparent plastic hood that surrounds the patient's head. The helmet does not have any pressure points on the face, thereby reducing patient discomfort and improving device tolerance without the risk of skin necrosis.25 The helmet allows the patient to see, read, talk, and interact more easily than other NIV respiratory devices. It is available in various sizes that can fit small children and adults.23 It has a soft latex free collar constructed of silicon-polyvinyl chloride that creates a pneumatic seal around the patient's neck. The presence of two or more inlet and outlet ports enable connections of standard respiratory inspiratory and expiratory limb tubing. A high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter is placed on the expiratory limb of the circuit to minimize exhaled aerosolized viral particles.8 Additionally, there is a distal variable CPAP valve. The extra ports allow a sealed site for the insertion of a naso-gastric tube, or the administration of a nebulizer. This port also enables the patient to drink from a straw. A monitor controls the gas flow in the helmet (n= 30-60 liters to prevent rebreathing and CO2 retention), temperature and FiO2. The presence of a zip in the helmet allows easy access if needed. The noise level in the CPAP helmet is equal 100 dB which can be reduced with a HME filter on the helmet gas inspiratory limb.38 Helmet CPAP requires a fairly cooperative patient with an intact neuromuscular system but tolerance appears to be excellent especially in those patients who feel claustrophobic with a tight fitting CPAP face mask. Armpit straps can be replaced with a counterweight system that results in better patient comfort and humidification can be added to the system.8 Occasionally, it may be necessary to reduce anxiety with the administration of very light sedation.",
