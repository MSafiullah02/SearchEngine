Sepsis in neonatal foals is a common sequela of failure of passive transfer and, in addition to development of SIRS, may be characterised by bacteraemia, pneumonia, enterocolitis, omphalophlebitis, meningoencephalitis or arthritis. Sepsis in mature horses is most commonly observed secondary to gastrointestinal lesions that result in disrupted mucosa and bacterial translocation into circulation (endotoxaemia). Pleuropneumonia and metritis may also cause sepsis in mature horses. Diagnosis of sepsis is based on SIRS criteria as well as suspected or confirmed infection. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of microbial culture and the subjectivity of sepsis scoring, many sepsis biomarkers are being studied for their usefulness in diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis in horses. Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach that includes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitation and pressure support, and treatment for inflammation, endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition of sepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for a successful outcome. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome may occur in severe cases of sepsis, with common manifestations including laminitis and coagulopathies. Although prognosis for septic mature horses depends highly on the primary disease process, the overall survival rate in septic neonatal foals ranges from 26 to 86%, with most studies indicating a survival rate of 45-60%. bs_bs_banner EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION 99 Equine vet.",

            "text": "Despite substantial advances in medical management, sepsis continues to represent a leading cause of illness and death in horses (Hoffman et al. 1992; Cohen et al. 1994; Werners et al. 2005; Peek et al. 2006) . The body's systemic inflammatory response to microbial invasion can lead to rapid deterioration despite pathogen control, which presents a challenge to equine practitioners. Several terms have been used to describe sepsis and its sequela. The American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine published a consensus report of definitions in 1992 adopted by veterinary specialists in order to provide accuracy and consistency among practitioners (Bone et al. 1992) . The term systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is used to describe systemic inflammation that may be caused by infectious agents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.) or noninfectious causes (e.g. trauma, burns, toxins, acidosis, etc.) . When SIRS is the result of infection, it is termed sepsis. The most common infectious agents associated with sepsis are bacteria. If bacteria are present in the blood, the term bacteraemia is used. Although it has been suggested that septicaemia be eliminated from current usage because it does not adequately describe the spectrum of organisms that may invade the blood, it is defined as bacterial infection in the blood in conjunction with SIRS. A frequent complication of SIRS is the development of organ system dysfunction which is called multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The term severe sepsis is defined as sepsis associated with hypoperfusion, hypotension or organ dysfunction. If a patient with severe sepsis is hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation, the term septic shock is used. Finally, a syndrome of immunosuppression that may result secondary to SIRS is compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) and may lead to leucocyte anergy and increased susceptibility to infection.",

            "text": "Endotoxaemia, defined as the presence of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) within the blood, is a common finding in bacteraemic neonatal foals and is a common sequela of equine gastrointestinal disease, pleuropneumonia and metritis (King and Gerring 1988; Steverink et al. 1994; Ryu et al. 2004; Vinogradov et al. 2008; Hilton and Pusterla 2009; Lopes et al. 2010; Senior et al. 2011) . By definition, dead Gram-negative bacteria or fragmented LPS in the blood is not considered 'infection,' but given the similar proinflammatory response, endotoxaemia is considered a subset of sepsis. Horses are exquisitely sensitive to the presence of endotoxin in the blood. Once in the blood stream, LPS may bind circulating LPS-binding protein (LBP), which as a complex then binds the CD14 molecule on monocytic cells. The resulting complex activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and LPS is transferred to myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD2) (Werners and Bryant 2012) . Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including LPS, may be recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) other than TLR4, with each recognising specific ligands (Werners and Bryant 2012) . Activation of PRRs by PAMPs triggers intracellular signalling which results in increased transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines include tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), interleukins (IL)1, IL6, IL8 and IL12 (Pernerstorfer et al. 1999) . Experimental intravenous (i.v.) administration of LPS to horses increases gene expression of IL1, IL6 and IL8 and TNF\u03b1, and also increases the concentration of IL6 and TNF\u03b1 proteins in the circulation (MacKay et al. 1991; MacKay and Lester 1992; Nieto et al. 2009 ). In addition, gene expression of TLR4 and MD2 in equine peripheral WBC has been shown to increase following endotoxin stimulation (Fossum et al. 2012) .",

In one study, a diagnosis of SIRS was associated with increased pulmonary infiltrates in the caudodorsal lung fields of affected foals, which may have reflected vascular leakage in regions of increased blood flow (Stewart et al. 1987; Bedenice et al. 2003) . In a retrospective evaluation of 65 foals with sepsis, 19% had clinical evidence of pneumonia (Gayle et al. 1998) . It is important to note that in many septic foals, respiratory rate and lung auscultation are normal despite pulmonary involvement. Several studies have documented a higher incidence of respiratory disease detected at necropsy compared to ante mortem findings in septic foals (Koterba et al. 1984; Raisis et al. 1996a ).",

Endotoxaemia can occur secondary to infectious enterocolitis or strangulating gastrointestinal lesions that lead to peritonitis. (Schott et al. 2001; Ernst et al. 2004) . Equine coronavirus is a newly emerging infectious disease in the United States that causes anorexia, lethargy, fever and, occasionally, diarrhoea. Although the mortality rate is low in affected adult horses, deterioration of clinical signs may be associated with gastrointestinal translocation of bacteria and subsequent sepsis (Pusterla et al. 2013) . Equine duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ) is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine that often results in severe endotoxaemia-associated SIRS (Davis et al. 2003) . Distinguishing DPJ from a surgical small intestinal lesion can be challenging, as strangulating obstructive lesions can cause similar clinical signs including SIRS secondary to endotoxaemia, gastric reflux and colic. In a prospective study, 14% of horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions requiring resection and anastomosis were bacteraemic, although this percentage may have been falsely low given the poor sensitivity of blood culture (Hurcombe et al. 2012 ).",

            "text": "Although these parameters are nonspecific, the SIRS criteria do not apply when other noninflammatory causes of these clinical signs are present, such as pain, heat stress or chemotherapy (Bone et al. 1992) . However, definitive diagnosis of bacterial sepsis is obtained through microbial culture. Unfortunately, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility results are usually not available until more than 48 h after admission and consequently, empirical treatment is often instituted prior to diagnosis. Early antimicrobial treatment, although warranted in suspect cases, may impede the sensitivity of culture as a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition, false negative blood culture results may be due to low numbers of circulating bacteria or a relatively low volume of blood for culture and varying blood culture systems may yield inconsistent results (Wilson and Madigan 1989) . A weighted sepsis scoring system is currently used as a diagnostic tool for sepsis in neonatal foals, but demonstrates a relatively low sensitivity and specificity (Brewer and Koterba 1988; Corley and Furr 2003) . Although clinicopathological findings such as leucopenia, neutropenia with a degenerative left shift and neutrophil toxicity have been associated with sepsis in horses, lack of test specificity limits their usefulness in contributing to a diagnosis of sepsis (Hurcombe et al. 2008 ). However, with regard to predicting survival, white blood cell (WBC) counts (>6.0 \u00d7 10 9 /l) and neutrophil counts (>4.0 \u00d7 10 9 /l) are significantly associated with increased odds of survival in septic foals (Gayle et al. 1998) . Elevated plasma fibrinogen has been associated with in utero infection and is associated with nonsurvival, but is also a nonspecific indicator of inflammation (Koterba et al. 1984) . Hyperfibrinogenaemia was observed in 89% of neonatal foals with confirmed meningoencephalitis (Viu et al. 2012) . Increased blood L-lactate concentration and persistence of hyperlactataemia are associated with nonsurvival in horses with systemic illness, but a clear association with bacteraemia is lacking (Castagnetti et al. 2010) . Evaluation of blood L-lactate concentration at a single time point is a poor predictor of sepsis (Borchers et al. 2012) , but is consistently elevated in foals with meningoencephalitis (Viu et al. 2012) . Cytokine profiles in septic horses have varied widely among studies and are not currently utilised for diagnosis or prognostication of equine sepsis in neonatal foals (Pusterla et al. 2006; Gold et al. 2007; Burton et al. 2009; Castagnetti et al. 2012) .",

Serum amyloid A has been advocated as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis of equine neonatal sepsis, but periparturient events may influence SAA concentrations (Chavatte et al. 1992; Stoneham et al. 2001; Duggan 2008; Paltrinieri et al. 2008) . Initial studies in neonatal foals suggest that quantification of SAA can differentiate infectious from noninfectious illness (Chavatte et al. 1992; Stoneham et al. 2001) . Concentrations of SAA have been shown to be increased in adult horses with bacterial pneumonia, influenza and septic arthritis (Hulten et al. 1999; Hulten and Demmers 2002; Jacobsen et al. 2006) . In one study, clinically abnormal adult horses demonstrated a 20.5-fold increase in median SAA compared to a relatively low (<2-fold) increase in median WBC count and median plasma fibrinogen concentration (Belgrave et al. 2013) . Increased concentrations of SAA have been documented in mares with experimentallyinduced endometritis, with serum concentrations correlating well with endometrial SAA expression (Christoffersen et al. 2010; Coutinho da Silva et al. 2013) .",

In mature horses (and occasionally in neonatal foals), the presence of SIRS in addition to isolation of bacteria from a local infection are used to diagnose sepsis. Due to the insensitivity of microbial culture, the presence of SIRS and a strong suspicion of infection may justify a diagnosis of sepsis.",

            "text": "Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach that includes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitation and blood pressure support, and treatment for inflammation, endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition of sepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for a successful outcome. Initially, a broad-spectrum bactericidal approach should be based on prediction of likely organisms (given the hospital or region's recent history) and should not be delayed pending microbial culture results if there is a high suspicion of sepsis. Based on several antimicrobial sensitivity studies in foals with bacteraemia, the current recommendation for empirical treatment of suspected neonatal foal sepsis is a combination of an aminoglycoside (amikacin: 21-25 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v. q. 24 h; gentamicin: 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v. q. 24 h) with penicillin G (sodium/potassium: 22,000-44,000 iu/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h; procaine: 22,000-44,000 iu/kg bwt i.m. q. 12 h), ampicillin sodium (15-50 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v. q. 6-8 h), or a thirdgeneration cephalosporin (ceftiofur: 2-5 mg/kg bwt i.m. or i.v., q. 6-12 h) (Wilson and Madigan 1989; Marsh and Palmer 2001; Sanchez 2005; Theelen et al. 2014a) . Targeted therapy should be implemented based on sensitivity results typically available 4-7 days after submission. Aminoglycosides should be avoided in foals with hypovolaemia or nephropathy and fluoroquinolones (e.g. enrofloxacin: 5-7 mg/kg per os or i.v. q. 24 h) should be reserved for those cases with resistance to other antimicrobials given the risk of arthropathy (Davenport et al. 2001) . Appropriate antimicrobial treatment of sepsis in mature horses is based on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility in cases of pleuropneumonia and metritis, while oxytetracycline (6.6-15 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12-24 h) is considered the treatment of choice for horses suspected of having equine neorickettsiosis (Bertin et al. 2013) . Horses with antimicrobial-associated colitis or salmonellosis are typically not treated with antimicrobials, but this may be necessary in severe cases in order to prevent bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteraemia.",

Although it may not be appropriate to classify the hoof as an 'organ,' it is reasonable to include laminitis in the MODS criteria given that widespread inflammation and coagulation disorders that lead to MODS in patients with sepsis/septic shock also lead to laminitis in carbohydrate and black walnut-associated laminitis (Parsons et al. 2007; Visser and Pollitt 2011; Kwon et al. 2013 ). Similar to SIRS criteria, MODS criteria have not been validated in the horse. Extrapolation from human medicine (with the exception of laminitis) defines MODS as dysfunction of 2 or more of the following systems: laminitis, haemostatic, neurological, renal, respiratory, intestinal, haemodynamic and hepatic (Bone et al. 1992) . Laminitis and haemostatic dysfunction (coagulopathies) will be discussed further.",

In a retrospective study comparing 73 hospitalised horses that developed laminitis with 146 that did not, the diagnosis of endotoxaemia was found to be the only factor significantly associated with laminitis (Parsons et al. 2007) . Although hypoxia and laminar microthrombi formation are suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology of endotoxin-mediated laminitis, several attempts to induce laminitis by experimental infusion of LPS have not been successful (Turek et al. 1985; Ward et al. 1987; MacKay et al. 1991; MacKay and Lester 1992; Tadros and Frank 2012) . Laminitis may also be induced by hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia (insulin resistance) (de Laat et al. 2012; Knowles et al. 2012) . In a retrospective analysis of 44 horses diagnosed with equine neorickettsiosis, laminitis was present in 38% of horses, 88% of which were affected in all 4 feet (Bertin et al. 2013) . Prophylactic treatment with digital hypothermia has been shown to decrease the incidence of laminitis in \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd 104",

Systemic inflammation associated with sepsis can cause widespread damage to the endothelium, which promotes coagulation. This hypercoagulable state can lead to microthrombi formation, ischaemia and MODS (Taylor et al. 2001) . As coagulation factors are consumed, the patient enters a hypocoagulable phase characterised by excessive bleeding (Epstein 2014) . In human patients with sepsis, administration of heparin is recommended for those patients in a hypercoagulable state (Zimmerman 2004) . Heparin has been shown to decrease the incidence of laminitis and increase survival in adult horses with hypercoagulable DIC, but heparin may increase bleeding in the hypocoagulable state; thus, its use in sepsis is controversial as these states may not be easily decipherable (Welch et al. 1992; Cohen et al. 1994) . Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; dalteparin) has reportedly fewer side effects than unfractionated heparin in horses, with the recommended dosage of 50 iu/kg bwt q. 24 h SC (Feige et al. 2003) . The incidence of DIC in septic foals can reach up to 50% and is associated with nonsurvival (Armengou et al. 2008; Bentz et al. 2009 ). Neonatal foals require a higher dosage of LMWH than adults to achieve anticoagulant activity blood levels and dosing at 100 iu/kg bwt q. 24 h subcutaneously appeared safe in a clinical study (Armengou et al. 2010) . Hyperimmune equine plasma containing coagulation factors may be beneficial in treating or preventing the hypocoagulable state of DIC (Welch et al. 1992) . In both neonatal and mature horses, treatment of the underlying disease is the most important therapy for DIC.",

            "text": "Since sepsis is a common, 'stand alone' diagnosis in neonatal foals, several studies have documented outcome. Survival rates in septic neonatal foals are highly variable, with reported short-term survival rates from 10 to 70% (Baker et al. 1986; Hoffman et al. 1992; Raisis et al. 1996b; Gayle et al. 1998; Stewart et al. 2002; Slack et al. 2005; Peek et al. 2006; Corley et al. 2007 ). However, outcome has improved significantly over time, which is likely due to early detection and treatment of at risk foals. In general, it is appropriate to quote a prognosis for short-term survival of approximately 50-60%, but individual factors will greatly influence the outcome. Foals with Gram-negative or mixed organism infections are more likely to die than foals with Gram-positive infection (Barton et al. 1998; Corley et al. 2007) . Odds of survival also decrease if septic arthritis is present, or if band neutrophils or serum creatinine concentration are significantly elevated (Sanchez et al. 2008) . Neonatal foals with confirmed meningoencephalitis have a poor prognosis, with one study reporting an 11% survival rate despite aggressive treatment (Viu et al. 2012) . There are few studies regarding long-term outcome in septic foals. One study reported that Thoroughbred foals with previous neonatal bacteraemia had significantly fewer racing wins and total earnings than siblings with no history of bacteraemia (Sanchez et al. 2008) . A second study reported that the development of septic arthritis in Thoroughbred racehorses significantly decreased the likelihood that the horse would successfully race (Steel et al. 1999) . Survival rates in mature horses with sepsis vary considerably with the primary disease process and are not always due to sepsis itself. Thus, it is difficult to prognosticate as no studies have been done to evaluate a large population of adult horses with the inclusion criteria of strictly SIRS or sepsis, regardless of the primary disease.",

Sepsis continues to represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal and mature horses. Although the word 'sepsis' has traditionally been used to describe bacteraemia and SIRS in neonatal foals, it is important to recognise that sepsis also occurs in mature horses, most commonly due to infectious enterocolitis, pleuropneumonia and metritis. Diagnosis of sepsis is difficult since SIRS criteria are nonspecific and microbial isolation and culture techniques are insensitive. Serum biomarkers are currently being investigated for their potential role in diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis. Successful treatment relies on rapid intervention, particularly with antimicrobial drugs to treat the primary disease, as well as hemodynamic support. The survival rate of septic neonatal foals ranges from approximately 30 to 85%, while outcome in mature horses with sepsis depends on the primary infection, severity of disease and complication rate.",
