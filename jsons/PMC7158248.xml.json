Histologic and immunohistochemistry studies defined a pattern of cutaneous and pulmonary pathology involving microvascular injury and thrombosis, consistent with activation of the alternative pathway (AP) and lectin pathway (LP) of complement. Co-localization of SARS-CoV-2-specific spike glycoproteins with complement components in the lung and skin was also documented. Our studies suggest that at least a subset of severe COVID-19 infection involves a catastrophic, complement-mediated thrombotic microvascular injury syndrome with sustained activation of the AP and LP cascades. Potential mechanisms of complement activation, including involvement of positive feedback loops with the coagulation system, are discussed in the context of hypothesis-generating studies providing the foundation for potential therapeutic intervention.",

Identification of C5b-9, C3d, or C4d within any epithelial basement membrane zone, elastic fibers, or the elastic lamina of vessels was considered nonspecific staining. IHC was performed using C3d (Cell Marque, Rocklin CA, 403A-78), C4d (Alpco, Salem NH, BI-RC4d), C5b-9 (Agilent, Santa Clara CA, M077701-5), and MASP2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, HPA029313) antibodies on paraffin embedded sections using a modified Leica protocol. Heat mediated antigen retrieval with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH = 9, epitope retrieval solution 2) was performed for 20 min, followed by incubation with each antibody for 15 min. Details have been described by one of the authors, including documentation of the involvement of many of these complement components in pathologic processes linked to complement activation in both dermal and lung tissues.12, 13, 14, 15 Staining for SARS-CoV-2 spike (catalogue #3525) and envelope (catalogue #3531) proteins (Prosci, Poway, CA) was optimized with cells from nasopharyngeal preparations obtained from individuals known to be positive or negative for the virus before being employed in the current studies. It involves use of horseradish peroxidase conjugate (ENZO, catalogue #ADI-950-113-0100) and an HRP-conjugated compact polymer system, with DAB as chromogen. Hematoxylin and eosin counterstain was used and mounted with Leica Micromount.",

He had severe hypoxemia and a blood pressure of 180/100. His international normalized ratio (INR) was mildly elevated at 1.2, with a partial thromboplastic time (PTT) within the normal range (23.0-37.0), and normal platelet count (178 \u00d7 109/L). Chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral airspace opacities most prominent in the peri-hilar distribution. After discussion with his family, he was placed on comfort measures and died a few hours after presentation. A limited autopsy was performed. Grossly, the lungs had a congested and hemorrhagic appearance. Light microscopic examination revealed a severe organizing hemorrhagic pneumonitis (Fig. 1\nA), including significant fibrin deposition within septal capillary lumens and walls accompanied by endothelial cell necrosis, consistent with a thrombotic necrotizing capillary injury syndrome (Fig. 1B). The pattern of septal capillary injury ranged from a pauci-inflammatory pattern (Fig. 1C) to one characterized by permeation of the inter-alveolar septa by neutrophils amidst the damaged capillaries, along with intra-alveolar neutrophils (Fig. 1D). No viral cytopathic changes were observed. Hyaline membranes reflective of DAD were not observed. In addition, and in contrast to preliminary reports of COVID-19 lung pathology,8\n,\n9 type II pneumocyte hyperplasia was not appreciated (Fig. 1A-D). The brunt of the lung injury was restricted to septal capillaries, without pneumocyte involvement.",

He was febrile, tachypneic, severely hypoxemic, and required emergent endotracheal intubation. He had a serum creatinine of 2.4. Chest x-ray showed bilateral airspace opacities. Sedatives and neuromuscular blockade were used to enforce a lung protective low-stretch strategy. His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation, shock, and progressive renal failure. His INR and PTT were within normal limits. On the 4th day of mechanical ventilation the patient developed thrombocytopenia (platelets 148 \u00d7 109/L) and severe hypercapnia, with a dramatic increase in the estimated pulmonary dead space fraction, and expired the following day. A limited autopsy demonstrated a pattern of lung injury that mirrored Case 1. Grossly, the lungs had a hemorrhagic and congested appearance. Microscopically, the lungs showed extensive hemorrhagic pneumonitis. The inter-alveolar septa were congested, with luminal and mural fibrin deposition within septal capillaries. Focal intra-alveolar collections of neutrophils and monocytes were seen. Viral cytopathic changes were not appreciated. Due to vascular compromise, there was concomitant striking red cell extravasation found within the alveolar spaces, along with intra-alveolar fibrin deposition. Unlike Case 1, there was some focal hyaline membrane formation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia in areas of hemorrhagic pneumonitis (Fig. 3\nA-D). However, unlike Case 1, this patient had been on ventilator support for one week, which can itself lead to some DAD, and yet, as in Case 1, the dominant pattern was septal capillary injury, not DAD.",

Albeit preliminary pathology studies of lungs from COVID-19 cases described DAD with edema, hyaline membranes, and inflammation, followed by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, features characteristic of typical ARDS,8\n,\n9 the pulmonary abnormalities in our patients appear largely restricted to the alveolar capillaries, i.e., more of a thrombotic microvascular injury with few signs of viral cytopathic or fibroproliferative changes.

It was present, but pauci-inflammatory. SARS-CoV-infected wild-type mice also had higher levels of neutrophils in the lung than their C3\u2212/- counterparts.7 Tissue neutrophilia may be attributable to the neutrophil chemoattractant properties of complement. Both neutrophils and complement are key sentinels of innate immunity and also modulate thrombogenic pathways, the latter thought related to C5a receptor/tissue factor cross-talk mediated by neutrophils.24 Neutrophilia in human SARS-CoV patients is associated with a poor outcome and could be an index of the extent of complement activation.7\n,\n25 Peripheral neutrophilia is not a significant observation in limited series of COVID-19 patients from China26 or the U.AS.,27 although there are insufficient numbers to assess its correlation with severity of disease. We have observed an increase in peripheral blood neutrophil vacuolization and granule content in our patients, consistent with an activated state, even if absolute numbers are not elevated.",

Indeed, we found deposition of AP and LP components in normal-appearing skin in 3 cases, not only in biopsies of retiform cutaneous lesions from those patients.

For example, one might have anticipated thrombocytopenia in the context of a systemic microvascular thrombosis in our cases. Although mild thrombocytopenia (100-150 \u00d7 109/L) has been recorded in 20% of COVID-19 patients,26 such values were seen in only 2 of our 5 patients, nor were platelets a prominent component of the fibrin microthrombi seen histologically. It is possible that infection-related thrombocytosis was mitigated by the development of severe vasculopathy. However, there is also precedent for such platelet values in an atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS)-type of microangiopathy. Platelet counts may be in the normal range despite severe thrombotic disease.29 Second, there appears to have been a delay of 5-9 days in most, if not all, of our patients between the onset of typical respiratory symptoms, including a non-productive cough, myalgias, fatigue, fever, and mild dyspnea, and a catastrophic change in respiratory status. This may reflect an evolution of immune processes\u2014anti-viral IgM levels would expect to emerge at this point\u2014or perhaps the fact that the complement cascade is a threshold pathway. When activated to a great extent it may exceed the capacity of complement regulatory proteins, both soluble and normally present in abundance on the microvasculature.29 That raises the issue of why only a subset of SARS-CoV2-infected patients develops such severe disease with features atypical for ARDS. The age range was wide among our cases, as was the degree of pre-existing immune suppression. But there are a variety of complement regulatory factor polymorphisms or mutations21 as well as coagulation pathway mutations which could promote susceptibility to enhanced complement activation and thrombosis in a given individual that should be investigated.",

Multiple studies have documented a role for the AP in microvascular injury,30 as characterized by C5b-9 deposition,13\n,\n31 but the lectin pathway has not been similarly investigated. Support for the involvement of the LP in COVID-19 comes from the discovery that MBL binds to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein.32 A complex of MBL with MASP-2 is the first step in LP activation, and part of a positive feedback loop leading to sustained AP activation, with inflammation and concurrent activation of the coagulation cascade.33\n,\n34 Although documented experimentally for SARS-CoV, this binding is speculative in terms of SARS-CoV-2, as certain sites on its glycoprotein spikes are mutated compared to SARS-CoV.35 However, glycosylation sites for high-mannose structures with the potential to similarly engage MBL, and thus activate MASP2, have been identified for SARS-CoV-2.35 Our data showing co-localization of products linked to activation of the AP (C5b-9) and LP (C4d) with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins are consistent with this hypothesis.",

First, MBL and ficolins bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns present on injured cells, enabling complex formation with MASP2.36 In addition, all three ARDS-linked coronaviruses use ACE2 as an entry point to cells.6 Angiotensin I and angiotensin II have been associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, and ACE2 is involved in their deactivation.37 If overwhelming coronavirus infection, with binding to ACE2 on epithelial targets not only in the lung but in other tissues expressing these proteins, including the kidney, intestines, and brain, were to interfere with ACE2 activity, the resulting increases in angiotensin II could lead to reactive oxygen species formation and interference with anti-oxidant and vasodilatory signals such as NOX2 and eNOS, with further complement activation. This has been demonstrated in a rat model of angiotensin II over-expression linked to other disorders.38 The potential loss of auto-vasoconstriction and regulation of lung blood flow through injured vascular segments would also lead to increased shunting and severe hypoxemia.
