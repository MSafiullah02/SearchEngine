Bacteria such as pathogenic serovars of Salmonella and Vibrio cholerae are responsible for severe diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera, and Escherichia coli serves as an important indicator organism for fecal contaminations. Today, more than 250 serotypes of E. coli are known ranging from harmless gut commensals to severe pathogens [1], such as the virulent enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli. Furthermore, viral infections can be spread via drinking water contaminations and highly infectious diseases are for example hepatitis A, poliomyelitis caused by the poliovirus or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which is caused by the coronavirus.",

In contrast to polymeric filter materials, ceramics feature outstanding positive properties because they are usually bio-inert, do not undergo swelling, are chemically and thermally stable, and withstand high mechanical stress enabling the cleaning and reuse of the filter after heat or acid/base treatment for decontamination [10], [11]. These excellent properties result in an increased membrane service life compensating the higher costs of ceramics in comparison to polymeric materials.",

These clustered bacterial communities are attached to the membrane surface and protect themselves against environmental influences. Bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to form complex macroscopic structures that increase their resistance against e.g. toxic chemicals and antimicrobial agents. The removal of biofilms from the membrane surface is challenging and results in both cost- and time-intensive membrane regeneration procedures. Therefore, the reduction of the initial physical attraction of bacteria to the membrane surface, which can be attributed to a reversible attachment [1], plays a key role in inhibiting the formation of biofilms and several antibacterial surfaces have already been proposed [12], [13]. Especially, immobilized nanosilver can act as an efficient antibacterial agent by killing retained bacteria directly on the membrane surface.",

Pore sizes of the capillary membrane of less than 0.2 \u03bcm and high open porosities of 51% enable the retention of bacterial cells during filtration [30]. Generated by direct reduction of silver nitrate on the membrane surface, immobilized Agnano display a bactericidal surface that kills filtrated bacteria directly on the membrane surface. Filtration experiments were performed by applying intracapillary feeding with bacterial suspensions and bacterial retention after different filtration times was determined using microbiological methods. The viability of retained bacteria was analyzed to evaluate the bactericidal action of immobilized Agnano and silver leaching during filtration was determined to consider eco-toxicological requirements.",

The obtained AAS results were comparable to the results derived from counting: total Agnano loadings increased with the number of immersions featuring 0.048 \u00b1 0.001 ng silver/mm2 specific surface area for 1 immersion, 0.123 \u00b1 0.004 ng silver/mm2 of capillary specific surface area for 3 immersions and 0.176 \u00b1 0.040 ng silver/mm2 of capillary specific surface area for 5 immersions (Fig. 4A). It is noticeable that the calculated amount of bioactive silver based on pixel-generated data of 20 ng per 1 mm2 geometric surface area was significantly higher than the total amount of silver of 0.18 ng per 1 mm2 specific surface area that was measured via AAS. The discrepancy of the results can be explained by the different reference membrane areas that were applied. Results from the counting method must be referred to the geometric surface area, since only Agnano on the outer membrane of the capillaries were considered for the counting. Fig. 4B and C clearly display that Agnano penetrated to a large extent into the pores of the capillary membrane. For that reason, for the determination of total silver loadings via AAS, the specific surface area determined via nitrogen-adsorption was considered as a reference leading to significantly lower values. Simultaneously, the deep penetration of Agnano into the pores displays an advantage by enhancing the accessible interaction surface of bactericidal Agnano and filtrated bacteria.",

This biofilm leads to pore blocking which is followed by an increase of the transmembrane pressure and operating time leading to lower filtration efficiencies.

AAS measurements revealed that the silver release was highest at the beginning of the filtration on each individual day. After the first burst release after 30 min of filtration on the first day where 400 \u00b1 3 \u03bcg/L of silver was released, silver leaching progressively decreased reaching values of 34 \u00b1 0 \u03bcg/L already after 60 min of filtration and only 21 \u00b1 17 \u03bcg/L at the last measurement after 420 min of filtration (Fig. 7\n).
