It has been proposed that lymphopenia is a feature of severe COVID-19 cases and may serve as a poor prognostic factor. Contributing factors likely include direct infection of lymphocytes and cytokine storm (5) It therefore seems prudent to utilize caution and consider avoiding medications which have the potential to further impact white blood cell production, particularly lymphocytes. By contrast, clinicians might determine that it is acceptable from a safety standpoint to continue psychotropics which have only been associated with agranulocytosis and neutropenia, assuming the patient does not have a secondary bacterial infection. Several psychotropics have been implicated in hematological adverse effects, including leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. The most commonly implicated psychotropics include carbamazepine and clozapine, but there is a class effect FDA warning on all first and secondary generation antipsychotics for the potential association with leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis as well as a number of published case reports. Carbamazepine is more likely to be associated with an early transient leukopenia, but has also been associated with agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia (6).",

            "text": "While the leukopenia and lymphopenia observed in COVID-19 patients may be less of a concern for clozapine prescribers in the setting of a normal neutrophil count, clozapine deserves unique mention given several potential challenges associated with its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges have been recently reviewed along with recommendations for management in a consensus statement by Siskind and colleagues (7). Patients on clozapine may have difficulty accessing routine absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitoring and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released guidance allowing healthcare providers to use medical judgment to delay laboratory testing for drugs subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) (8). While there is no data yet available on COVID-19 in patients on clozapine, it has been suggested that clozapine is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia and its complications. Explanations include aspiration, sialorrhea, sedation, and poorly understood effects on the immune system (7,9). Patients should be educated on symptoms of pneumonia and urgently evaluated by a clinician if symptoms of infection emerge. Complicating the picture further, elevation of clozapine levels has been observed with multiple acute viral and bacterial infections. This may in part be related to effects of systemic infection and inflammation on CYP450 enzymes (10). Clinicians should closely monitor clozapine levels and consider reducing the dose by up to a half in patients with fever and other signs of infection.",

These factors may impact the decision to prescribe psychotropics that have been associated with platelet dysfunction and increased bleeding risk (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and valproic acid).

Proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include derangement of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) signal pathways, cytokine storm and myocarditis. Additionally, several medications being utilized off-label in the management of COVID-19 (azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir) have been reported to prolong the QT interval.

Although the data are often difficult to interpret due to confounding factors, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants and the SSRI citalopram, appear to be the agents of most concern. It is difficult to stratify antipsychotic medications by QT prolongation risk. Of the typical antipsychotics, thioridazine causes the greatest QT prolongation, although IV haloperidol has also been implicated. The greatest risk among the atypicals appears to be related to ziprasidone and possibly iloperidone. Aripiprazole and possibly lurasidone have been associated with the lowest risk based on available data (15).",

If QT-prolonging medications are used in a patient with a QTc>500ms or other significant risk factors, ECGs should be monitored frequently (daily in high risk cases), potassium and magnesium should be repleted, cardiology involvement should be considered, and every attempt made to reduce risk factors (15).

The etiology of the liver injury is not known and hypotheses include viral infection, drug-induced liver injury, and systemic inflammation due to cytokine storm or hypoxia (16). Lab abnormalities observed include elevated AST, ALT and bilirubin (17). Liver function tests should be monitored and, if abnormal, consideration given to avoiding psychotropics that can also cause hepatic injury or making dose adjustments if heavily dependent on hepatic metabolism. Since most psychotropics are lipid soluble and require hepatic metabolism prior to clearance, clinicians should review the package insert to determine if a dose adjustment is needed. Additionally, many psychotropics (valproate, carbamazepine, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and second-generation antipsychotics) have been associated with mild hepatoxicity that manifests with modest, transient increases in liver enzymes. Only a few, are thought to have a high risk of causing serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including chlorpromazine, carbamazepine, valproate, duloxetine and nefazodone (18,19).

Additionally, psychiatrists should be aware of any renal impairment and make necessary dose adjustments as per the manufacturer\u2019s prescribing information. Psychotropics highly dependent on renal excretion include lithium, gabapentin, topiramate, pregabalin and paliperidone. Many other psychotropics have renally excreted active metabolites.

A recent paper from Wuhan (22) reports neurologic symptoms in 36.4% of COVID-19 patients, falling into 3 categories: 1) Central nervous system symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and seizure); 2) Peripheral nervous system symptoms (impairment in taste, vision and smell, neuropathic pain) and 3) Skeletal muscular injury. It is not known whether these neurologic syndromes are a direct effect of the virus entering the central nervous system or an indirect response to the cytokine storm that patients are experiencing. A specific prevalence rate of delirium was not reported but is presumed to be very high and to contribute to poor adherence with care and other safety concerns. Certainly, for patients with severe COVID-19 infections, there are many other potential etiologies of delirium, including organ failure, hypoxia, sepsis, medication effects, and electrolyte/metabolic abnormalities. Observational studies have in fact reported high rates of benzodiazepine use for sedation in ventilator-dependent COVID-19 patients (23). Environmental factors such as isolation from family members and difficulty mobilizing patients also contribute (24).",

            "text": "While there are no absolute contraindications to use of psychotropics in COVID-19 patients, psychiatrists must be mindful of potential adverse effects and conduct a thoughtful risk-benefit analysis as part of their clinical decision-making process. For example, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin have the potential for QT prolongation, which can be problematic in patients with tenuous cardiac status. Generally, psychiatrists might avoid antipsychotic medications in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. However, in our experience, hyperactive delirium in COVID-19 patients is highly prevalent and manifests with severe agitation that can be difficult to treat and leads to dangerous behaviors such as removing oxygen or assaulting staff. While there is limited evidence to support the use of any interventions in the management of agitation in COVID-19 associated delirium, most CL psychiatrists consider antipsychotics such as haloperidol the gold standard for managing agitation in delirious patients. In these situations, the CL psychiatrist should assist the medical team in reasoning through the cardiac risks of using an antipsychotic balanced against effective management of the agitation. Use of an antipsychotic with cardiology involvement and frequent EKG monitoring or telemetry may be deemed acceptable. Alternatives such as alpha-2 agonists (dexmedetomidine and clonidine) or anti-epileptics (valproic acid) should be considered if the individual patient\u2019s cardiac risk is determined to be high and/or if the antipsychotic is clinically ineffective. Melatonin has been proposed for addressing consciousness and sleep-wake cycle disturbances in delirious COVID-19 patients, especially given its potential for anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects (83). With the exception of patients who chronically use alcohol or benzodiazepines and may be at risk for withdrawal, benzodiazepines should be avoided if possible and considered only as a last resort for highly agitated delirious patients for whom other treatments are unavailable or ineffective. Early delirium screening and non-pharmacological strategies to prevent or treat delirium such as frequent orientation and early mobilization should be employed if practically feasible (24).",

For these patients, psychiatrists should consider whether the benefit of a low dose benzodiazepine outweighs the potential risk of respiratory depression. Use of benzodiazepines may be reasonable in patients with adequate oxygen saturation and absence of confusion or a depressed sensorium. Depending on the individual patient\u2019s circumstances and symptoms, alternative medications such as gabapentin, buspirone, hydroxyzine, a low dose atypical antipsychotic, or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) may be appropriate.
