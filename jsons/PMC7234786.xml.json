Rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cornerstone of all efforts to stem its advancement. Molecular detection via RT-PCR can result in falsely negative results due to the low viral loads in a sample. Serological methods are being developed and have proven to be a useful supplementary approach in confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection.2 The US Food and Drug Administration has issued numerous Emergency Use Authorisations, including serological tests; however, the potential for cross-reactivity with antibodies present in the sera of patients with other diseases remains largely unknown. Cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with antibodies against other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, has been shown.3 In addition, cross-reactivity has been observed from autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with autoimmune disease when testing for SARS-CoV,4 which shares high sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2. As such, we wanted to determine whether autoantibodies interfere with detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",

The samples were collected from Jan 1, 2016, to June 30, 2019, which predates the COVID-19 pandemic. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies was done with colloidal gold-labelled kits supplied by Innovita Biotechnology Co, Tangshan, China. The nitrocellulose filter of these colloidal gold-labelled assays are coated with two antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (N protein and S protein). The overall testing sensitivity was 89% (352/397) and specificity was 91% (116/128).",
