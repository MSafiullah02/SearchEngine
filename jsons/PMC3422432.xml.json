            "text": "Type I interferons (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) are critical innate cytokines that limit viral replication and dissemination prior to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. In addition to inducing an antiviral state, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 exert numerous other functions including induction of apoptosis, mobilizing innate cells, and regulating adaptive immune responses (Barton,2008; Borden et al.,2007; Stetson and Medzhitov,2006; Vilcek,2006). As these pleiotropic effects can be detrimental if left unregulated, the innate antiviral response has to be controlled to minimize cell injury and maintain cellular homeostatic functions. Although an early IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 response contributes to viral control and disease outcome, its precise regulation is especially critical in the central nervous system (CNS), where the health of nonrenewable neurons as well as resident glia is vital for the maintenance of host physiological function. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production and signaling is thus tightly regulated by both the basal and inducible expression of numerous factors involved in the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway.",

            "text": "During viral infections the ability to induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is determined by activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) following interaction with pathogen associated molecular patterns, which typically constitute viral RNA or DNA structures. PRRs comprise members of the Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) family and the cytosolic helicase sensors, retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene 1 (RIG\u2010I), and melanoma differentiation\u2010associated antigen 5 (MDA5) (Kawai and Akira,2009; Mogensen,2009). PRR recognition of viral RNA triggers the activation and nuclear localization of interferon regulatory factors (IRF) IRF3 and IRF7 leading to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction. By binding to its receptor, secreted IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 initiates a signaling cascade leading to transcription of a variety of interferon stimulated genes (ISG). ISG encode both direct antiviral factors as well as PRR and signal transduction components, such as IRF7 and STAT1 (Borden et al.,2007). This amplification loop thus elevates the ability of cells to induce and respond to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. In general IRF7 is considered the master switch in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction following various viral infections due to its role in amplifying IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Honda and Taniguchi,2006). Because the pattern as well as levels of PRR, IRF, and IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor expression and activation varies with each cell type, initial IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction and amplification can be very distinct depending on the cell types infected (Colonna,2007; Stewart et al.,2005). Furthermore, due to the potency of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in inhibiting viral replication, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway, either at the induction or signaling level (Levy and Garcia\u2010Sastre,2001; Sen,2001). Microglia and astrocytes are primary sentinels within the CNS parenchyma responding to stimuli triggered by either microbial infection or degenerative events (Dong and Benveniste,2001; Hanisch,2002; Paul et al.,2007). This function is partially attributed to basal expression of a vast array of PRRs (Bsibsi et al.,2002; Carty and Bowie,2011; Hanke and Kielian,2011; Okun et al.,2009; van Noort and Bsibsi,2009). Irf3 mRNA, and to a lesser extent Irf7 mRNA, are constitutively expressed in the CNS. While Irf7 expression is highly inducible, Irf3 transcripts remain constant following infection (Ousman et al.,2005). However, their relative expression in different cell types has not been extensively explored. Consistent with PRR activation, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons all induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 (Paul et al.,2007). However, the vast majority of information on CNS innate responsiveness is derived from primary glia and neuronal cultures established from neonates and may not reflect responsiveness of fully differentiated cells. Distinct from in vitro studies, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production in vivo is highly restricted as indicated by the small proportion (<5%) of infected neurons with detectable IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Delhaye et al.,2006). Furthermore, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 inducible Irf7 transcripts mapped closely to sites of viral RNA (Ousman et al.,2005), supporting highly focal IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 responses. Overall however, little is known about responsiveness of distinct CNS cell types to viral infections in vivo. Specifically oligodendroglia appear to express a limited TLR repertoire at basal levels compared with microglia (Hanke and Kielian,2011; Okun et al.,2009; Paul et al.,2007). They also do not appear to contribute to extensive proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Cannella and Raine,2004).",

            "text": "Infection with the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (JHMV), belonging to the positive strand RNA coronavirus family, was used to better characterize the ability of oligodendroglia to mount innate antiviral immune responses in vivo based on its prominent infection and persistence in oligodendroglia (Bergmann et al.,2006). In adult mice, JHMV infection causes an acute encephalomyelitis, which resolves into a persistent infection of the spinal cord associated with demyelination. In addition to oligodendroglia, JHMV also infects microglia and infiltrating macrophages during acute infection; however, neuronal and astrocyte infection is sparse (Ireland et al.,2008, 2009). Coronaviruses are poor inducers of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in numerous cell types due to their 5\u2032RNA structures mimicking self RNA (Daffis et al.,2010; Zust et al.,2011). However, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is induced in microglia, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Cervantes\u2010Barragan et al.,2007; Roth\u2010Cross et al.,2008). Importantly, a protective effect of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in vivo was highlighted by uncontrolled MHV replication in mice deficient in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling (Cervantes\u2010Barragan et al.,2007; Ireland et al.,2008). Furthermore, protection following peripheral MHV infection is associated with TLR7 dependent IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Cervantes\u2010Barragan et al.,2007). The na\u00efve CNS is devoid of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Serafini et al.,2000), implicating infected glia as primary candidates contributing to protective IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production following CNS infection. This is supported by MDA5 mediated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production in infected microglia (Roth\u2010Cross et al.,2008).",

Both glia populations were isolated directly from the CNS to monitor changes in mRNA expression. These results are the first to imply an inherent paucity in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 transcription by oligodendroglia, coincident with limited expression of PRR and signaling molecules downstream of PRR activation. The dependence of oligodendroglia on IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 from other cellular sources to induce an antiviral state in vivo highlight the potent monitoring functions of microglia and suggest a mechanism to preserve oligodendroglial homeostatic functions.",

Following centrifugation at 400g for 7 min, cells were resuspended in 30% Percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and concentrated by centrifugation for 30 min at 800g at 4\u00b0C onto a 1 mL 70% Percoll cushion.

            "text": "Induction of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 by murine coronaviruses is mediated via TLR7 in pDC and via MDA5 in microglia/monocytes (Cervantes\u2010Barragan et al.,2007; Roth\u2010Cross et al.,2008). Furthermore, both MDA5 and RIG\u20101 act as PRR in an oligodendroglia cell line (Li et al.,2010). However, the expression of these viral sensors in oligodendroglia in the adult CNS is unknown. To analyze their capacity to initiate innate responses, oligodendroglia and microglia were isolated from spinal cords of uninfected PLP\u2010GFP mice by FACS based on their respective CD45\u2212 GFP+ and CD45lo/int F4/80+ phenotypes (Malone et al.,2008). Spinal cords were used as donor tissue based on higher oligodendroglia yields compared with brains. The potential of mature oligodendroglia to recognize viral RNA in comparison to microglia was assessed by comparing basal transcript levels of genes encoding the viral RNA sensors MDA5, RIG\u2010I, TLR3, and TLR7 (Kawai and Akira,2007). Whereas transcription of all four PRR was readily detected in microglia, Mda5, Rig\u2010I, and Tlr3 transcripts were significantly reduced and Tlr7 was below detection in oligodendroglia (Fig. 1A). Basal levels of PRR mRNAs are low in the resting CNS relative to lymphoid tissue, with the exception of Tlr3 (McKimmie et al.,2005). Nevertheless, PRR are rapidly upregulated during viral encephalitis initiated by Semliki Forest virus, Rabies virus, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (McKimmie et al.,2005; Sharma and Maheshwari,2009). However, the relative contribution of infiltrating leukocytes versus resident CNS cells was not directly assessed. Microglia and oligodendroglia were therefore isolated from JHMV infected mice to evaluate upregulation of PRRs during the course of infection. Microglia upregulated Mda5, Rig\u2010I, Tlr3, and Tlr7 transcripts two\u2010 to fivefold over basal levels, with peak expression at Days 3\u20135 postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 1B). Relative to the modest fold increase in microglia, Mda5 and Rig\u2010I transcripts were vastly increased in oligodendroglia. Rig\u2010I expression reached levels similar to microglia by Day 3 p.i. amounting to an \u223c70 fold increase over na\u00efve levels (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, Mda5 mRNA levels in oligodendroglia remained overall lower compared with microglia. Similarly, mRNAs encoding the endosomal PRR TLR3 and TLR7 were also induced in oligodendroglia, but absolute levels remained low and peak expression was delayed relative to microglia. Induction of Mda5 and Rig\u2010I in oligodendroglia, as well as all RNA sensing PRR in microglia, correlated with induction of Ifn\u03b14 and Ifn\u03b2 mRNA in the CNS following JHMV infection (Ireland et al.,2008; Malone et al.,2008). To evaluate additional contributions of Type II (IFN\u03b3) and Type III (IFN\u03bb) IFN, which also induce ISG, the RNA expression kinetics of all three IFN families were assessed in spinal cords (Fig. 2). Confirming previous results (Malone et al.,2008) Ifn\u03b14 and Ifn\u03b2 mRNA were increased at Day 3 and peaked at Day 5 p.i. Although there are three Type III IFN\u03bb family members, IFN\u03bb1 is a pseudogene in mice; therefore primers were used to detect IFN\u03bb2/3. IFN\u03bb was minimally induced, yet with similar kinetics as IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, confirming very low expression and function in the CNS following heterologous infections, including a closely related MHV strain (Sommereyns et al.,2008). IFN\u03b3 mRNA was not upregulated until Day 5 p.i., and increased substantially by Day 7 p.i. As both IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 signaling target many overlapping ISG, a contribution of early IFN\u03b3 to increased PRR expression could thus not be excluded.",

Although basal Mda5 and Rig\u2010I mRNA levels were diminished by eight\u2010 to ninefold in microglia from na\u00efve IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 relative to Wt mice, they were only slightly reduced in oligodendroglia (Fig. 3). These results are reminiscent of previous observations that PRR expression in neurons is controlled by basal IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling (Shrestha et al.,2003). Importantly, the absence of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling abrogated upregulation of Mda5 and Rig\u2010I transcripts in both microglia and oligodendroglia following JHMV infection (Fig. 3). Early induction of Mda5 and Rig\u2010I, both classified as ISG, thus demonstrated that oligodendroglia respond to exogenous IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in vivo, similar to microglia. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 thus enhances the potential to recognize invading RNA viruses, thereby facilitating early innate responses.",

Furthermore, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in response to coronavirus infection has been demonstrated in microglia in vitro and in vivo (Roth\u2010Cross et al.,2008) as well as in an oligodendroglial cell line (Li et al.,2010). Given the distinct basal and inducible levels of Mda5 transcripts in mature CNS derived glial populations, the contribution of infected oligodendroglia and microglia to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction was assessed in vivo by comparing Ifn\u03b2 and Ifn\u03b14 mRNA relative to viral replication in each population. Viral loads were monitored by measuring viral mRNA encoding the N protein, the most abundant viral RNA in infected cells (Skinner and Siddell,1983). Viral\u2010N transcripts prevailed in microglia at Day 3 p.i., but decreased by Days 5 and 7 p.i. (Fig. 4). By contrast, although viral mRNA was near detection levels at Day 3 p.i. in oligodendroglia, the levels increased \u223c20 fold relative to microglia by Day 5 p.i. Despite subsiding by Day 7 p.i., viral mRNA levels remained significantly elevated relative to microglia. These results not only assured that infected cells were recovered by the isolation procedure, but clearly indicated that virus predominated in microglia early, but subsequently prevailed in oligodendroglia. Concomitant with infection, sparse but detectable basal levels of Ifn\u03b2 and Ifna4 transcripts increased in microglia (Fig. 4). Ifn\u03b2 levels were sustained through Day 5 p.i., while Ifn\u03b14 levels were only transiently upregulated. The contribution of infiltrating infected monocyte\u2010derived macrophages (Ireland et al.,2009) to Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 induction was also assessed. Viral RNA loads in macrophages were <50% of those in microglia and declined with similar kinetics; Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 transcripts reflected the magnitude of viral RNA transcripts similar to microglia (data not shown). By contrast, neither Ifn\u03b14 nor Ifn\u03b2 mRNA were detected in oligodendroglia from na\u00efve or infected mice (Fig. 4), despite higher viral RNA loads as well as elevated Mda5 and Rig\u2010I mRNA by Day 5 p.i.

PRR signaling requires several mediators including the inducible kinase IKK\u03b5 (also known as Ikbke or Ikki) and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. While IRF3 is constitutively expressed, IRF7 is induced by IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and amplifies IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Honda and Taniguchi,2006; Honda et al.,2005). Therefore to investigate the potential for PRR signaling, oligodendroglia were examined for expression of mRNAs encoding IKK\u03b5, IRF3, and IRF7. All three mRNAs were regulated in a cell type\u2010specific manner (Fig. 5). Microglia from na\u00efve mice expressed higher basal Ikk\u03b5 transcripts compared with oligodendroglia, which were modestly, but progressively upregulated throughout Day 7 p.i. (Fig. 5). By contrast, Ikk\u03b5 induction was not detected in oligodendroglia until Day 7 p.i., at which time levels reached those in microglia. Irf3 mRNA was readily detected at basal levels in both microglia and oligodendroglia from na\u00efve mice, but tended to decline following infection (Fig. 5). Lastly, Irf7 transcripts were sparse in both microglia and oligodendroglia derived from naive mice (Fig. 5), consistent with lower basal CNS expression relative to Irf3 (Ousman et al.,2005). However, in contrast to the increase of Irf7 mRNA detected in microglia by Day 3 p.i., induction was more modest and occurred delayed in oligodendroglia following infection (Fig. 5). As the Irf7 gene is an ISG, its upregulation in microglia was consistent with IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 upregulation. By contrast, the delayed response in oligodendroglia implied more selective ISG induction and/or distinct IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor signaling thresholds.",

However, optimal induction was delayed and absolute levels were not as robust as in microglia. These results suggested that oligodendroglia is exposed to limiting amounts of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in the microenvironment, or that they are intrinsically more limited than microglia in IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 responsiveness. While the first possibility is difficult to address in vivo, the second may reflect reduced expression of the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) or downstream signaling components. We therefore assessed regulation of transcripts encoding the IFNAR, as well as STAT1 and IRF9, which act downstream of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 binds a common receptor complex consisting of two transmembrane proteins, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. As IFNAR2 exists as a soluble (IFNAR2a) and transmembrane (IFNAR2c) and isoform generated by alternative splicing (Domanski et al.,1995), we examined basal expression patterns of IFNAR1, and both IFNAR2 isoforms in microglia and oligodendroglia. Basal mRNA levels of the Ifnar1 chain were approximately twofold higher in microglia compared with oligodendroglia. However, transcripts encoding both the soluble as well as the transmembrane form of Ifnar2 were more than fivefold higher in microglia compared with oligodendroglia (Fig. 6A), suggesting more limited responsiveness of oligodendroglia to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. Stat1 and Irf9 levels were also elevated in microglia compared with oligodendroglia derived from na\u00efve mice (Fig. 6B). STAT1 is inducible by both IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3, while IRF9 is constitutively expressed in most non CNS cell types (Borden et al.,2007). Consistent with a response to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, Stat1 mRNA indeed increased \u223c10 fold by Day 3 p.i. and remained elevated until Day 7 p.i. in microglia (Fig. 6B). By contrast, a reduced capacity of oligodendroglia to respond to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 was supported by the modest upregulation of Stat1 transcripts at Days 3 and 5 p.i. The prominent increase of Stat1 at Day 7 p.i. suggested IFN\u03b3 mediated upregulation. Irf9 transcripts were only upregulated twofold in microglia by Day 3 p.i. and subsequently declined to or below basal levels (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, despite lower basal levels and apparent constitutive expression, Irf9 transcripts in oligodendroglia rapidly increased by \u223c15 fold at Day 3 p.i. and remained stable to Day 7 p.i. Although activation and nuclear localization of STAT1 and IRF9 remains to be evaluated, the overall limited basal levels of Ifnar1 and Ifnar2, as well as basal and inducible levels of Stat1 and Irf9 transcripts in oligodendroglia during JHMV infection, support an inherent paucity in ISG transcriptional activation.",

            "text": "The notion of limited ISG transcriptional activation in oligodendroglia was further supported by analysis of a subset of ISG encoding factors with antiviral activity. Basal levels of transcripts encoding protein kinase R (Pkr), and the OAS/RNaseL pathway (Oas2), known to modulate translational activity, were all elevated in microglia derived from na\u00efve mice relative to oligodendroglia (Fig. 7). Transcripts encoding adenosine deaminase specific for mRNA (Adar1), which limits viral replication via introduction of mRNA mutations (Bass,1997), were also more abundant in microglia (Fig. 7). By contrast, Ifit2 RNA was expressed at similar levels in both cell types derived from na\u00efve mice. Importantly, in microglia all transcripts, particularly Oas2 and Ifit2 RNA, were rapidly increased to peak levels by Day 3 p.i. and declined thereafter. With the exception of Oas2, induction was also evident at Day 3 p.i. in oligodendroglia, but increases were most prominent by Day 7 p.i.; nevertheless, they never reached the peak absolute values observed in microglia (Fig. 7). These data demonstrate that oligodendroglia not only express lower steady state levels of ISGs, but also upregulate transcription with delayed kinetics relative to microglia in response to virus infection. Furthermore, delayed ISG expression in oligodendroglia indicated a more prominent responsiveness to IFN\u03b3 than IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. Overall the data clearly suggest that oligodendroglia require paracrine IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signals to induce ISG during gliatropic coronavirus infection.",

Poly I:C is a strong agonist of both TLR3 and the RIG\u2010like receptors RIG\u2010I/MDA5 (Alexopoulou et al.,2001; Kato et al.,2006). Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 upregulation was initially tested in total tissue to characterize the time course of poly I:C induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 responses in the CNS. Ifn\u03b2 expression was maximal at 2 h and Ifn\u03b14 mRNA was elevated between 2 and 12 h post poly I:C inoculation (Fig. 8). By contrast, peak induction of the ISGs Ifit1 and Ifit2 was delayed until 12 h (Fig. 8). Cell type\u2010specific gene analysis of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and ISG after intracerebral poly I:C injection was thus performed in purified microglia and oligodendroglia at 4 h as an intermediate timepoint for optimal Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 expression and at 12 h. In microglia Ifna4 and Ifn\u03b2 transcripts were clearly induced by 4 h and expression of Ifn\u03b2 was sustained until 12\u2010h postinoculation (Fig. 9). Importantly, the 30\u201340 fold higher levels than those induced by viral infection (see Fig. 4), were consistent with the low viral loads in the microglia population. Importantly however, Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA remained near detection thresholds in oligodendroglia (Fig. 9). Mda5 and Rig\u2010I levels were also increased more robustly in both cell populations after poly I:C injection relative to virus infection (Fig. 9). Furthermore, similar to the trend observed during infection, Rig\u2010I transcripts were significantly increased over Mda5 transcripts in oligodendroglia. Nevertheless, Ikk\u03b5 and Irf7 transcripts were elevated in both microglia and oligodendroglia at 4 and 12 h after poly I:C (Fig. 9) relative to viral infection (Fig. 5). While limiting IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 levels thus clearly contributed to suboptimal ISG induction in both glial populations following infection, the mechanisms underlying the paucity of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction specifically in oligodendroglia remain elusive. Representative of antiviral ISG expression, Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNA were also increased in microglia at 4 h, but subsided by 12 h post poly I:C administration. By contrast, Ifit1 and Ifit2 induced in oligodendroglia at 4 h were lower than in microglia, but were sustained at 12 h (Fig. 9). Even under these conditions of infection independent in vivo stimulation, oligodendroglia exhibited tentative and delayed ISG induction. These results were further supported by isolating microglia and oligodendroglia from na\u00efve adult mice and stimulating each population ex vivo with poly I:C in the presence of FuGENE to trigger intracellular PRR activation (Supp. Info. Fig. 2). FuGENE dramatically increased transcription of Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 in microglia 8 h post poly I:C stimulation. However, under similar conditions, Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA remained below detection in oligodendroglia. Similarly, induction of Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNA was increased greater than threefold in microglia treated with both poly I:C and FuGENE, compared with poly I:C alone, supporting enhanced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 mediated induction. By contrast, although Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNA induction was detectable in treated oligodendroglia, overall levels were significantly reduced, supporting an inherently low, if any capacity to induce Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA. Overall our results support the notion that in vivo oligodendroglia are not only intrinsically impaired in inducing IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to RNA stimuli, but also in responsiveness to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 suggesting an overall dampened capacity for innate responses.",

While PRR expression and activation in microglia and astrocytes has been extensively explored in vitro (Butchi et al.,2010; Carpentier et al.,2008; Jin et al.,2011; So and Kim,2009), expression of PRR and associated signaling components in glia in vivo are poorly defined, especially in oligodendroglia. In this study we compared the capacity of oligodendroglia relative to microglia to mount IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 mediated innate immune responses. Glial specific responses were monitored within the context of the CNS following intracerebral infection of adult mice with gliatropic JHMV or injection of poly I:C. Microglia were prominent inducers of Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA following infection, consistent with IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in primary microglia as well as bone marrow derived macrophages infected with a heterologous MHV (Roth\u2010Cross et al., 2008). However, the inability of oligodendroglia to induce Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA, despite their high load of viral RNA, contrasted with in vitro studies demonstrating MDA5 and RIG\u2010I dependent IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in the infected N20.1 oligodendroglia cell line (Li et al.,2010). This discrepancy likely reflects differences in expression and/or induction of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway components, rather than distinct viral loads, as even poly I:C did not induce Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 in oligodendroglia in vivo or ex vivo.",

            "text": "The restricted ability of coronaviruses to induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 was recently attributed to the O\u2010methylated cap structure of the viral RNA, making it difficult for the host to distinguish viral from self mRNA (Daffis et al.,2010; Zust et al.,2011). However, in contrast to cultured fibroblasts, bone marrow\u2010derived dendritic cells, astrocytes, and neurons, the ability of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, macrophages/microglia, and an oligodendroglia cell line to induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 via TLR7, MDA5 and MDA5/RIG\u2010I dependent pathways (Cervantes\u2010Barragan et al.,2007; Li et al.,2010; Roth\u2010Cross et al.,2008; Zhou and Perlman,2007) suggests sufficient PRR activation by viral RNA structures to mediate protective responses in select cell types. Our data indicate that cell type\u2010specific basal expression, as well as inducible components in the innate signaling pathway constitute critical signaling thresholds determining IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction. In the adult CNS oligodendroglia differed significantly from microglia in reduced basal transcript levels of viral RNA sensing PRRs and Ikk\u03b5. However, basal Irf3 transcripts were only reduced by \u223c50%, and Irf7 transcripts were barely detectable in either cell population, consistent with higher basal Irf3 than Irf7 levels observed in whole na\u00efve brains (Ousman et al.,2005). Reduced basal PRR levels in oligodendroglia were reminiscent of sparsely expressed PRRs in primary neurons (Carpentier et al.,2008), and supported the superior initiation of Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 responses by microglia. This concept is consistent with the inability of primary cultured neurons and astrocytes to induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 expression following MHV infection (Roth\u2010Cross et al.,2008). It remains to be confirmed whether other CNS infections involving oligodendroglia reveal a similarly muted pattern of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction and responsiveness. However, most RNA viruses are neuronotropic, with only some variants of Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus displaying tropism for oligodendroglia in mouse strains susceptible to persistent infection (Brahic et al.,2005). However, during the acute CNS infection, this virus primarily infects neurons and oligodendroglia and is only infected during the persistent stage, making direct comparisons difficult.",

            "text": "Optimal IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction requires amplification through IFNAR to elevate PRRs and IRF7 (Honda and Taniguchi,2006; Honda et al.,2005; Malmgaard et al.,2002). However, in contrast to Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 induction, IFNAR signaling was intact in oligodendroglia. Although IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 protein was below detection in cell\u2010free supernatants derived from the JHMV infected CNS by ELISA (data not shown), IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 sufficed to upregulate the ISGs Mda5, Rig\u2010I, Stat1, Irf7, Pkr, Ifit2, and Adar1 in oligodendroglia. The ability of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 to induce ISGs was consistent with basal expression of IFNAR chains, as well as basal and inducible levels of Stat1 and Irf9 transcripts. Although induction above basal levels was greater in oligodendroglia than microglia for some genes, peak absolute mRNA levels were in general lower compared with those reached in microglia, as exemplified by Stat1 and Irf7 mRNA. Furthermore, peak expression for many genes did not correlate with maximal Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA levels, but rather with peak IFN\u03b3 mRNA and protein at Day 7 p.i. (Phares et al.,2011). The distinct pattern of ISG expression in oligodendroglia compared with microglia may further reside in low IKK\u03b5. In addition to mediating PRR signaling, IKK\u03b5 influences ISG induction through participation in JAK/STAT mediated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling (Pham and Tenoever,2010; Tenoever et al.,2007). Although not as severe as the complete abrogation of ISG induction in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice, IKK\u03b5\u2212/\u2212 mice lack induction of \u223c30% of ISGs, including Adar1 (Durbin et al.,1996; Tenoever et al.,2007). The biological consequences are demonstrated by impaired clearance of influenza virus infection by IKK\u03b5\u2212/\u2212 mice, despite similar expression of IL2, IL6, IL12, IFN\u03b3, and RANTES as well as induction of antiviral antibody (Tenoever et al.,2007). The paucity of Ikk\u03b5 mRNA and modest, if any, increase of Irf7 mRNA in oligodendroglia, despite abundant viral and Mda5 mRNA upregulation, may partially explain the absence of Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 expression and more selective and delayed ISG induction during infection. However, even the strong IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 response elicited in microglia by poly I:C did not overcome the inability of oligodendroglia to induce Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2, despite the overall higher increases in Ikk\u03b5 and Irf7 transcripts relative to those induced by infection. These results suggest additional restrictions intrinsic to oligodendroglia in the initiation of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production. Furthermore, limited ISG expression by oligodendroglia following infection can partially be attributed to overall low IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction by JHMV, as upregulation of the prominently IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 dependent Ifit1 and Ifit2 mRNAs was enhanced in both microglia and oligodendroglia following poly I:C administration relative to infection. These results suggest that the ability of oligodendroglia to respond to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is dependent on the overall availability of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in the local environment.",

            "text": "The results thus indicate a reliance of oligodendroglia on external production of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 to induce an antiviral state. This concept is consistent with data indicating that microglia are a dominant source of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 within the CNS during JHMV induced encephalomyelitis (Roth\u2010Cross et al., 2008). The biological relevance of suboptimal IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 responses is clearly evident from differential viral control in both cell types. A direct response to infection by microglia is supported by the correlation between peak viral and Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA. Furthermore, the early decline in viral RNA, prior to infiltration of T cells, indicates autocrine IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 contributes to the rapid control of virus in this cell type. By contrast, although oligodendroglia were initially infected to a lesser extent than microglia, viral RNA increased over 2 logs between Days 3 and 5 p.i., coincident with no Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 and tentative induction of antiviral ISGs. These data indicate that oligodendroglia rely largely on T cell effector function, prominently IFN\u03b3, for viral control (Parra et al.,2010). Oligodendroglia are indeed highly responsive to IFN\u03b3 as indicated by upregulation of Class I MHC molecules and associated antigen processing components during peak IFN\u03b3, but not IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 induction during JHMV infection (Malone et al.,2008). Moreover, specific blockade of IFN\u03b3 receptor signaling on oligodendroglia prolongs JHMV infection in this cell type (Gonzalez et al.,2005, 2006; Parra et al.,2010). Whether early events favoring robust infection of oligodendroglia prior to emergence of T cells, contribute to ultimate persistence of JHMV in oligodendroglia, remains to be elucidated.",

Limited innate antiviral activity may predispose oligodendroglia to be potent responders to IFN\u03b3 (Gonzalez et al.,2005; Popko and Baerwald,1999). While there is no evidence supporting toxicity of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 (Akwa et al.,1998), more restricted induction of antiviral mediators, especially those also affecting host cell translation, may circumvent apoptosis and guarantee maintenance of critical myelin housekeeping functions and survival. Our findings also contradict the hypothesis suggesting that virus initiated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by oligodendroglia drives inflammatory responses during viral\u2010induced demyelinating disease (Lipton et al.,2007). The low abundance of PRR at basal levels rather provide a mechanism underlying the apparent paucity of oligodendroglia to express cytokines during multiple sclerosis or other CNS inflammatory conditions (Cannella and Raine,2004; Zeis et al.,2008). Our data thus support the notion that oligodendroglia are defensive players under inflammatory conditions.",
