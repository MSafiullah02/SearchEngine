On the other hand, Mounier-Kuhn Syndrome (MKS,or tracheobronchomegaly), is a clinical disorder extremely rare with idiopathic etiology,which distinguished by abnormal dilatation of the trachea and main bronchi due to atrophy or lack of elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells. MKS is regularly related to recurrent lower respiratory infection. Therefore, this point is substantial for recognizing MKS, as the primary identification because it can lead to superior management and prevention of complications [7] [8] [9] [10] . To our knowledge this is the first case reporting ARDS,COVID19 and Mounier-Kuhn syndrome in Iran",

The diameter of trachea measures 39 mm, the right main bronchus 30 mm and the left main bronchus 26 mm. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) and bronchiectasis in the mid and lower zone of both lungs, with small air cysts in the lower zone of the right lung due to early stage ARDS in COVID-19 pneumonia can be noted. Figure 2 : Four axial CT scan show ill--defined bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and bronchial dilatation within areas of GGO bilaterally and a small air cyst in the right middle lung lobe, suggestive of an early stage ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia subsequently confirmed by PCR test.",
