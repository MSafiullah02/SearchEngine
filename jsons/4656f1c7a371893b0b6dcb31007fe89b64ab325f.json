            "text": "David G. Brownstein Section of Comparative Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven Human beings differ widely in their responses to virus infections. Viruses may induce barely discernible symptoms in some patients and severe, life-threatening illness in others. These differences reflect both the complex, intimate, and multifaceted nature of virus-host interactions and the variables that can influence these interactions. Viruses elicit a complex temporal sequence of stringently regulated innate and adaptive immune responses. These responses are essential for recovery, but they also contribute to disease symptoms. Optimal innate and adaptive immune responses are therefore balanced at a narrow interface between ineffectual and overly aggressive. Variables of age, gender, health and immune status, and genetic background influence the availability and form of the host metabolites on which viruses depend; these variables also influence the magnitude and effectiveness of the ensuing host response.",

            "text": "It is well recognized that null mutations of human genes that are essential for innate or adaptive immune responses render homozygotes susceptible to diseases caused by a wide spectrum of viruses. Little is known, however, about the role that more subtle and ubiquitous human gene polymorphisms play in virus-disease resistance. Recent highly publicized reports that individuals who are homozygous for mutant alleles of the CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR-5) are HIV-1 resistant has stimulated interest in this area of human genetics (Dean et al. 1996; Samson et al. 1996) . CCR-5 is a coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1. The mutant allele that renders homozygotes refractory to HIV-1 infection carries a 32-bp deletion in an extracellular domain and thereby generates a nonfunctional receptor. This allele is present in \u223c11% of Caucasian populations; \u223c1% of the population is therefore homozygous and highly (but not absolutely) resistant to HIV-1 infection. Many other genetic variations that affect viral receptors are likely to influence susceptibility to other viruses.",

It encodes a type I interferon-inducible nuclear protein that affords specific protection against influenza viruses. Only three mouse strains, A2G, SL/NiA and T9, express the antiviral form of protein; other mouse strains have deletions in the Mx1 gene that result in truncated proteins that are devoid of antiviral activity (Staeheli et al. 1988) . MxA is the human homologue of Mx1 (Staeheli et al. 1985) . Like Mx1, MxA is induced by type I interferon and inhibits influenza-virus replication. Virus specificity for MxA is somewhat broader than virus specificity for Mx1 in that it encompasses vesicular stomatitis virus and measles virus; and, unlike Mx1, MxA is a cytoplasmic protein (Pavlovic et al. 1995) . Although the mechanisms of virus inhibition by Mx proteins have not been determined, they appear to involve GTP binding, GTPase activity, and leucine zippers. Variants of human Mx proteins have not been described, but, given the dramatic impact of the Mx1 polymorphism on influenza-virus resistance in mice, functional polymorphisms of human Mx proteins could markedly influence resistance to several important viruses.",

Quantitative binding studies, to compare alleles of genes that encode known viral receptors, may be necessary if alleles are shown to code for functional receptors. Comparatively small differences in the affinities of receptors encoded by different alleles can have dramatic consequences on the course of virus infections in individuals. In the case of the Bgp1 gene, the 10-100-fold difference in the affinity of the Bgp1 a and Bgp b gene products for MHV translates, after nine replication cycles, into a 10 9 -fold difference in virus titers in the major target organs.",

            "text": "Although rodent and human NK cells use different classes of inhibitory class I-specific receptors, downstream signaling events are similar. Both inhibitory rodent Ly49 receptors and human KIRs have cytoplasmic tails that contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibiting motifs that transduce inhibitory signals by recruiting and activating cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (Burshtyn et al. 1996) . Also, KIRs, like Ly49 in rodents, do not undergo somatic rearrangement but are highly complex gene clusters. At least seven genes encode p58 receptors, and p70 receptors are products of a similar number of genes (Moretta et al. 1997) . Activating p58related receptors, named \"p50,\" are also encoded by genes in this region of chromosome 19. Because of the presence of both activatory receptors and inhibitory receptors with HLA-class I or other specificity, the KIR gene family appears to be a candidate region for virusresistance genes in humans.",

The specificity of these genes for particular viruses may depend on whether Cmv1 and Rmp1 influence resistance by encoding receptors that bind only virus homologues of class I molecules. If receptors encoded by one or both genes bind host ligands, then a wider spectrum of viruses may be influenced by them.",

They provide the probes to detect functional homologues of resistance genes that are shared by rodent and primate lineages. They delineate novel genetic mechanisms of resistance, such as functional but less sticky virus receptors. They also highlight specific genetically complex and polymorphic components of the innate immune system as sources of variation in human responses to viruses. Other benefits are likely to emerge as more mouse virus-resistance genes are identified and characterized. Clearly, not all details of virus-restriction pathways are conserved, but even where differences exist, functional similarities may be enough to guide genetic studies of human resistance to viruses.",
