            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV\u20102) is an important pathogen for domestic dogs and wildlife worldwide. CPV\u20102, a non\u2010envelop, single\u2010stranded DNA virus, belongs to the family Parvoviridae. CPV\u20102 causes acute haemorrhagic enteritis and myocarditis in dogs with high morbidity and frequent mortality (ranging 10%\u201390%). In 1977, it was first reported that CPV\u20102 arose from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) with at least six coding nucleotide differences in the VP2 gene. CPV\u20102 can be further grouped into three antigenic variants, including CPV\u20102a, CPV\u20102b and CPV\u20102c, based on unique amino acid residues at the positions 297 and 426 of VP2 (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b were reported in 1979 and 1984, with unique amino acid residues as 426N and 426D, respectively. Both CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b variants are distributed worldwide and infect both dogs and cats but exhibit low pathogenicity in cats (Clegg et al., 2012). In 1990, CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b were replaced by two new variants of CPV\u20102a (CPV\u20102a\u2010297A) and CPV\u20102b (CPV\u20102b\u2010297A), with one unique amino acid substitution, S297A (Decaro et al., 2009). In 2000, CPV\u20102c was first reported in Italy with one substitution at the VP2 gene (D426E) (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). Recently, CPV\u20102c has been circulating predominantly in Europe and the Americas (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2012). CPV\u20102c has also been reported in Asia, including cases in China, India, Taiwan and Vietnam (Chiang, Wu, Chiou, Chang, & Lin, 2016; Nakamura et al., 2004; Nandi, Chidri, Kumar, & Chauhan, 2010; Zhao et al., 2016). It has also been reported that CPV\u20102c can cause severe diseases in cats (Miranda, Parrish, & Thompson, 2014; Nakamura et al., 2001). In Thailand, CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b have been reported as major variants circulating in dogs (Phromnoi, Sirinarumitr, & Sirinarumitr, 2010), while CPV\u20102c has never been reported in the country. In this study, CPV\u20102c was detected in domestic dogs and cats during a viral enteric disease surveillance. This study is the first to report and characterize an emergence of Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c in domestic dogs and cats in Thailand.",

The surveillance was carried out in four provinces of Thailand under the animal use and care protocol # 1731074. Rectal swab samples were mainly collected from dogs and cats with acute haemorrhagic or watery diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and dehydration. During 20 months of surveillance, 507 rectal swab samples were collected from dogs (n = 444) and cats (n = 63) of young age (<1 year), adult (1\u20135 years) and older (>5 years) with vaccination history records. Of 444 canine samples, 366 samples from sick dogs and 78 from healthy dogs were collected. Of 63 feline samples, 60 samples from sick cats and three from healthy animals were collected. All samples were subjected to parvovirus identification by PCR specific to the VP2 gene, as previously described (Buonavoglia et al., 2001).",

The viral DNA was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used. PCR assay for parvovirus identification was conducted as previously described (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). The oligonucleotide primers specific to the VP2 gene were Hfor: 5\u2032\u2010CAGGTGATGAATTGCTACA\u20103\u2032 and Hrev: 5\u2032\u2010CATTTGGATAAACTGGTG GT\u20103\u2032, located at positions 3556\u20133575 and 4166\u20134185 of CPV\u20102, respectively. In brief, PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl comprising 1 \u03bcl of DNA, 0.8 \u03bcM of each forward and reverse primer, 1\u00d7 TopTaq Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1\u00d7 CoralLoad, and distilled water. The PCR condition was set as initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 3 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 45 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The expected size of parvovirus positive amplified product was 611 bp. Identification of CPV2 antigenic variants was performed by using PCR\u2010RFLP to differentiate CPV\u20102c and CPV\u20102a/CPV\u20102b variants. The PCR product size was 583 bp of the coding capsid protein VP2. Then, the PCR product was digested with enzyme Mbo II (New England Biolabs, USA) that selectively recognizes the restriction site \u201cGAAGA\u201d (nucleotide 4062\u20134066 of the VP2 encoding gene). The CPV\u20102c was digested into two fragments of 500 bp and 83 bp (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). The negative samples from CPV\u20102c PCR\u2010RFLP assay were detected for CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b variants with specific primers (CPV\u20102abF/CPV\u20102abR and CPV\u20102bF/CPV\u20102bR) generating the product size of 681 bp and 427 bp, respectively (Pereira, Leal, & Durigon, 2007; Pereira, Monezi, Mehnert, D'Angelo, & Durigon, 2000) (Table S1). Concurrently, the CPV\u20102a/CPV\u20102b samples were confirmed by sequencing of the flanking region at amino acid position 426 to identify CPV\u20102a or CPV\u20102b variants.",

The criteria for selecting these 34 viruses for genetic characterization were based on epidemiological and demographic data, such as age of dog, date of isolation, breed and vaccination history. The selection criteria for the two viruses for whole genome sequencing were based on the representatives of CPV\u20102c from dogs (CU\u201024) and cats (CU\u201021). Parvovirus genome sequencing was conducted by using oligonucleotide primer sets previously described or new primer sets designed using the Primer 3 plus program (Table S1) (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Koressaar & Remm, 2007; Untergasser et al., 2012).

In brief, the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acids of Thai\u2010CPV\u20102 and FPV were aligned with those of vaccine and reference strains of CPV2\u2010a, CPV\u20102b, CPV\u20102c, CPV\u20102a\u2010297A, CPV\u20102b\u2010297A from the USA (CPV\u201013/1981, CPV\u2010411b/1998, OH20219/2015), Japan (Y1), China (SC\u201002/2011), India (KolkataD5/2014), Indonesia (HCM14/2013), Italy (288\u201001/2001, 1\u201099/1999), Vietnam (HCM7/2013) and Thailand (KU14/2008). Genetic analysis for CPV\u20102 antigenic typing (VP2 at positions 297 and 426) and important amino acid determinants (VP2 at positions 300, 305, 321, 323, 324, 370, 371, 375) was conducted by the alignment of VP2 by using MEGA v6.06 and MegAlign software v.5.03 (DNASTAR Inc.). For the phylogenetic analysis, the partial VP2 gene sequences of Thai\u2010CPV\u20102 and FPV were analysed with those of reference viruses. Vaccine and reference viruses, including CPV\u20102\u2010vaccine strains (n = 3), CPV\u20102 (n = 2), CPV\u20102a (n = 3), CPV\u20102b (n = 3), CPV\u20102c (n = 14), CPV\u20102a\u2010297A (n = 11), CPV\u20102b\u2010297A (n = 7), FPV vaccine (n = 3), FPV\u2010G1 (n = 9), FPV\u2010G2 (n = 1) and FPV\u2010G3 (n = 3), were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree of partial VP2 gene was constructed by BEAST 1.8 with the Bayesian Markov\u2010Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) algorithm. A strict clock model with coalescent constant population and HKY with gamma 4 substitution were used as model parameters (Drummond, Suchard, Xie, & Rambaut, 2012). The Bayesian MCMC chain lengths were 10,000,000 generations, with sampling every 10,000 generations. The tree iteration was discharged with 10% of the chains as burn\u2010in pattern by using a tree annotator, and the resulting MCC tree was drawn with FigTree software (v1.4.2) (Molecular evolution, phylogenetics and epidemiology, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK) (Figure 1). To determine the selective pressure on the partial VP2 (nucleotide positions 817\u20131314, amino acid positions 274\u2013428), the ratio of non\u2010synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions was estimated using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME) within the HyPhy software package (Murrell et al., 2012). The significance levels were set at p = 0.1. The values dN/dS > 1, dN/dS = 1 and dN/dS < 1 were used to define positive selection, neutral mutations, and negative selection, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was also constructed by using maximum\u2010likelihood with bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replications using the MEGA v.6.06 program (Tamura, Dudley, Nei, & Kumar, 2007) (Figure S1).",

For FPV, the viruses were subjected to VP2 gene sequencing (n = 11). The nucleotide sequences of the parvoviruses were submitted to the GenBank database under accession no. MH711880\u2013MH711913 (Table 3). Pairwise comparisons of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Thai viruses were performed against those of vaccine and reference strains. Our results showed that the whole genomes of two Thai\u2010CPV\u20102 (Dog/CU\u201024 and Cat/CU\u201021) had 99.90% nucleotide identity to each other and the highest nucleotide identities to Vietnam CPV\u20102c (99.60% at WG, 99.90% at VP2) (Table S3).

Similarly, Thai\u2010CPV\u20102c contained unique amino acids at positions 297A and 426E, which were observed in reference CPV\u20102c. It is important to note that unique amino acid substitutions at positions Y324I and Q370R were only observed in the Asian strain CPV\u20102c (VietNam\u2010HCM7, Chinese\u2010YZ\u20108, BJ14\u20109, Taiwan\u2010C104 and Indonesia\u2010HCM), including Thai\u2010CPV\u20102c, but were not observed in American and European CPV2\u2010c (Table 4 and Figure 2).",

The infected animals showed clinical signs of acute haemorrhagic or watery diarrhoea. In this study, the positivity of CPV\u20102 in dogs was 29.95% and that of FPV in cats was 58.73%, which were high in non\u2010vaccinated animals. This study also showed that CPV\u20102 was predominantly detected in dogs of young age (<1 year). These results were similar to the previous report of CPV\u20102 in puppies in Thailand (Sakulwira, Vanapongtipagorn, Theamboonlers, Oraveerakul, & Poovorawan, 2003). It is important to note that CPV\u20102c could also be isolated from cats. Similar observations were also reported in other studies (Miranda et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2001). One FPV infection in a dog was observed, as also seen in a previous study of FPV infection in sick dogs in Pakistan in 2018 (Ahmed et al., 2018).",

Similar studies reported Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c in China and Taiwan (Chiang et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2013). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Thai\u2010CPV\u20102c is closely related to Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c, including VietNam\u2010HCM7, Chinese\u2010YZ\u20108, BJ14\u20109, Taiwan\u2010C104 and Indonesia\u2010HCM. These viruses were in separate subclusters from North American and European CPV\u20102c. Our analysis suggested that the estimated time of the most recent common ancestor of Thai\u2010CPV\u20102c subclusters was 2004 (Figure 1). The substitution rate of parvovirus in this study was in agreement with other studies (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20132.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year) (Hoelzer, Shackelton, Parrish, & Holmes, 2008; Pereira et al., 2007; Shackelton, Parrish, Truyen, & Holmes, 2005). Moreover, our data indicated that parvovirus (which is DNA virus) has high genomic substitution rate similar to other RNA viruses at approximately 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year (Duffy, Shackelton, & Holmes, 2008). Whole genome analysis indicated that Thai\u2010CPVs are closely related to Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c with unique amino acids at position 297A, 370R and 426E of VP2, suggesting predominant Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c in the country. It is also noted that unique amino acid substitutions at positions Y324I and Q370R were only observed in Asian strains of CPV\u20102c. These unique amino acids (370R) might relate to receptor\u2010binding properties, suggesting species preference. Recent observations have also been reported in China and Taiwan (Chiang et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2013).",

CPV\u20102c is an emerging variant in the country and the Southeast Asia region. These findings will stimulate concern regarding whether currently used canine parvovirus vaccines will provide full protection against the new variant, Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c. In summary, our results demonstrated the emergence of the new variant Asian\u2010CPV\u20102c in dogs and cats in Thailand. Since cats can be infected with CPV\u20102c, dogs can also be infected with FPV. Thus, veterinary practitioners should focus more attention on both CPV and FPV infections, especially interspecies transmission. In Thailand, the surveillance of CPV and FPV should be further conducted on a larger scale to determine the dynamics of predominant variants and their distributions. This information will aid early diagnosis and the development of future strategies for domestic animal vaccination.",
