However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc.",

As of February 17, 2020, the confirmed COVID-19 case in Wuhan city, nationwide of China, and world globally reached to 37152, 70635, and 71429 respectively [4, 5] . In the patients with COVID-19, some special population should be paid special attention to. Epidemiological survey shows that COVID-19 patients with underlined conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the elderly are not only susceptible, but also often more serious. These patients are at higher risk of admission to intensive care or death [6, 7] . In addition, the profound impact inflicted by COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns has also been noticed [8, 9] . However, as far as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease patients, especially uremic HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the large population size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD treatment in 61 centers in Wuhan city.), the high aggregation and mobility of HD center population, and the low immune function of uremic patients [10] , the situation of HD patients under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored.",

The high mortality is obviously related to the epidemic situation. However, it was found that no one patient died of pneumonia directly after tracing the causes of death of 7 patients. The main causes of death were cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications or hyperkalemia, which was presumed due to the reduction of dialysis times for fear of contracting the virus. It should be noted that although HD patients are highly susceptible to COVID-19, the infection for them is likely less severe or fatal. Actually, none of the 37 infected patients in our center has been admitted to ICU due to severe pneumonia. Some infected patients even have no obvious clinical symptoms. These suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic emerging, measures of prevention and protection certainly should be taken to avoid infection, but the sufficient dialysis remains the key issue for patients to survive the epidemic.",

Cellular immune profiling and cytokines measurement To explore the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the cellular immune profile and the cytokines production, we successfully recruited 19 COVID-19 contracted HD patients and 19 non-COVID-19 HD patients in further blood sample collection under their permission and cooperation. 30 Healthy volunteers were simultaneously enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were isolated from the blood sample from the participants. Isolated PBMCs were stained with a BD multitest IMK Kit (Cat340503, BD Biosciences) for analyzing the frequency and cell number of total T, CD4 + T\uff0cCD8 + T, B and NK in healthy controls and patients. After being stained, the cells were measured by flow cytometry on an LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed using the FolwJo software (TreeStar).

Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [11]. In brief, the suspect case of COVID-19 is defined as the one has the epidemiological history or clinical presentations of fever, respiratory symptoms, or decreased white blood cells or lymphocytes count. The clinical diagnosed case is recognized when the suspect case displays the imaging features of pneumonia. The confirmed case is identified if the suspected cases or clinical diagnosed case is positive in pathogenic test. According to the guidance of the government, all patients were transferred to the corresponding designated hospitals for treatment after infection and disease assessment and classification. We followed up all patients and examined some patients with their consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (V1.0 / 2020-01-30).
