They are the most common type of nasal mass and are smooth and gelatinous structures that are attached to the mucosal membrane by a thin stalk or pedicle.1 The frequency of observing nasal polyps is approximately 1\u20134 per cent, and the condition is 2\u20134 times more widespread in men than women.2,3 Although many theories have been suggested with regard to their aetiopathogenesis, no firm conclusion has as yet been reached. However, it is believed that allergic, infectious, mechanical, immunological and biochemical factors play a role.3 Histopathologically, mucosal swelling induced by inflammation is caused by basal membrane thickening, atypical gland formation, goblet cell hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration and subepithelial oedema.4",

The EBV is very rare in nasal polyps whereas it is diagnosed in 88 per cent of patients with normal nasopharyngeal mucus; therefore, the contribution of the EBV to the aetiology of nasal polyps has not been taken into consideration among other possibilities.14 In a study conducted in Canada in patients with nasal polyps, in situ hybridisation was used to identify EBV from DNA, but no EBV was identified.15 Most probably, the difference observed in EBV positivity was due to the geographical differences of the study cases and the various techniques used in the studies.
