            "text": "Vitamin D may be protective against acute respiratory infections and atopic illnesses, but studies have been conflicting 1, 2. One likely reason is the vast variability in measurement of vitamin D (based on interview about dietary intake vs. actual measurement of 25\u2010hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD] concentrations) and major differences in study populations (age, confirmation of atopy status, use of vitamin D supplements, and latitude of study region). The recommended minimum level of serum 25OHD varies from 50 to 75 nmol/l 2, 3. In Finland, all young children are instructed to have vitamin D supplement of 10 \u03bcg (400 IU) per day. Despite the recommendations, the 25OHD levels in serum have been deficient (<50 nmol/l) in up to 21\u201331% of Finnish children 1, 2, 4. In other Westernized populations, 10\u201317% of the children have been reported to have 25OHD levels <50 nmol/l 2. However, data remain scarce on the 25OHD levels in high\u2010risk children susceptible to viral infections and asthma development, such as young wheezing children 1. To investigate this issue, we analyzed serum 25OHD levels in a cohort of first\u2010time wheezing children that were well characterized for virus etiology and atopy status.",

Wheezing refers to expiratory breathing difficulty with high pitch sound during expiration. Eczema was defined as atopic eczema when IgE sensitization was present. The need for hospitalization was decided by an on\u2010duty physician outside of the study team. The illness severity score is a summed score for the degree of dyspnea (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), type of breathing (0 = normal, 1 = use of stomach muscles, 2 = use of intercostal muscles, 3 = nasal flaring), severity of auscultatory findings (0 = none, 1 = expiratory, 2 = inspiratory and expiratory, 3 = audible without stethoscope) an assessment of expiratory:inspiratory time (0 = 1:2, 1 = 1:1, 2 = 2:1, 3 = 3:1). The children were discharged from the hospital when the respiratory symptom score was <3, and there was no more wheezing. Parents filled a diary of respiratory symptoms (cough, breathing difficulty, noisy breathing, symptoms during sleep, use of bronchodilators) for 2 weeks after hospital discharge.

Despite that all participating families, at the 4\u2010year follow\u2010up visit (n = 77), reported having given vitamin D supplement during early life, a strong inverse association was seen in our study as well as in earlier studies 6, 7. We speculate that the supplement use becomes more irregular after early childhood. On the contrary, the incidence of atopic sensitization increased with age. One might expect an association between 25OHD and atopy (or other atopic characteristics) in these kinds of circumstances 2, but we did not find it in age\u2010adjusted analysis. A recent case\u2013control study by Stenberg et al. 6 reported an association between vitamin D insufficiency and wheezing in young children, but they did not find an association between vitamin D status and atopy\u2010related factors. A few studies of young children without wheezing, or of older children, have reported an inverse association between the 25OHD level and atopic dermatitis or severity of atopic dermatitis 2, 7, 8. The differences between our finding and these other studies may be explained by the adequate mean 25OHD concentration in our study population (86 nmol/l). In the other studies, the mean levels of serum 25OHD were much lower than in our study \u2013 for example, 29 nmol/l 8 and 48 nmol/l 7.",

We did not find a connection between 25OHD and specific respiratory virus infection, not even for sensitive markers of rhinovirus load, virus coinfection or prolonged shedding of bocavirus (based on combined PCR and serology diagnostics) in wheezing children. Urashima et al. 10 studied the effect of vitamin D intake on susceptibility to influenza A infections in Japanese school children and reported an inverse effect. However, they did not measure serum 25OHD levels. A population\u2010based study of Science et al. 9 reported that low serum 25OHD levels are associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infections. Compared to our study, the median levels of serum 25OHD were again lower in this study (62 nmol/l), which may explain the significant associations.",
