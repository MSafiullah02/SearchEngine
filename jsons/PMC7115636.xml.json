First isolated in 1940, influenza B virus diverged into two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata, in the late 1970s with similar clinical [2] but different phylodynamic properties [3]. Although infections in pigs and seals were observed, there is no known animal reservoir for influenza B [4]. Thus, while influenza A infections can be zoonotic, influenza B virus only circulates in the human population. The narrow host range and slower evolution [5] are thought to be the main contributing factors to the less frequent occurrence of influenza B epidemics [6].",

The major antigenic regions are the 120-loop, 150-loop, 160-loop, and 190-helix [13] and are located on the HA1 subunit which forms the globular head domain. It is responsible for recognition and binding of sialic acids on the surface of the target cells. The HA2 subunit is the main component of the HA stalk. Although some antibody cross reactivity is observed [14], [15], vaccine efficiency between the two lineages might be reduced in seasons in which the formulation of the trivalent influenza vaccine does not match the circulating strain due to antigenic differences [16], [17]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that vaccine effectiveness is already waning within a season thus reducing immunological protection even if the vaccine contained the matching strain in the previous season [18].",

Cases of seasons 2015/16 and 2016/17 were combined (i.e. 2015\u20132017) and compared to 2017/18. The two groups differed in the age distribution (p < 0.001; Fig. 2\n). Patients of the season 2017/18 were older than patients of 2015\u20132017. The median age was 56 and 10 years, respectively. However, when considering the pediatric (patients 17 and younger) and adult (patients 18 and older) populations separately, median age and age range did not differ between groups 2015\u20132017 and 2017/18. Therefore, a further analysis was done to compare the clinical features of the influenza B infections of the pediatric and adult patients with regard to the seasons and between the two age groups (Table 2\n). For the pediatric patients there were no significant differences between season 2017/18 and 2015\u20132017 except for the combined rate of comorbidities and risk factors for a severe course of the influenza. However, this could not be attributed to a single analyzed factor. When looking at the adult population, there were no significant differences between season 2017/18 and the previous seasons except for a higher proportion of female patients and a lower proportion of viral coinfections in 2017/18. Most differences were noted between the age groups. 32.3% of the adult patients were vaccinated, mostly with the trivalent vaccine, whereas 95.5% of the pediatric patients were unvaccinated. The rate of comorbidities was significantly higher in the adult population. Furthermore, the clinical course of the disease was more severe in the adult population as higher rates of ICU admissions, invasive ventilation, and fatal outcomes were observed.",

In Germany, it was the largest season in terms of case numbers since the establishment of the nationwide surveillance system in 2001 [11]. Large scale epidemics or pandemics are usually caused by influenza A. This is attributed mostly to the broader host range and faster rate of evolution of influenza A [6]. Influenza B infections usually occur with a temporal delay towards the end of an influenza A-dominated season [23]. The exceptional impact of influenza B infections in 2017/18 with regard to public health was therefore surprising. However, seasons with a high proportion of influenza B infections occur infrequently. Specifically, in Germany, the mild seasons of 2001/2 and 2005/6 and the severe season of 2015/16 have been dominated by influenza B with a share of up to 78% of all influenza cases. The high severity of the season 2017/18 with an overall estimate of 9 million excess consultations in Germany [11] may be attributed to several factors.",

Both the attack rate and the relative illness ratio of influenza B are highest for children and decrease with age [24], [25]. However, the major difference that was seen for the season 2017/18 was the higher proportion of adult patients. The age-subgroups themselves, being pediatric patients and adult patients, were not different in their clinical characteristics between 2017/18 and the two previous seasons. However, the adult population that was seen had a high proportion of comorbidities and risk factors that might have contributed to a severe outcome of the influenza disease, as it is known for example for cardiac insufficiency [26], additionally to age itself [2], [27], [28]. A shift towards the adult population thus increases the impact on the public health system and may explain the severity of this season with a high number of excess consultations. An interpretation of the presented clinical data, however, needs to be done with caution as there may be a bias towards severe disease courses in a hospital setting. A fatality rate of 11.2% of the adult population of this study can thus not be transferred to the general population.",

When looking at the influenza B component of the broadly used trivalent influenza vaccine there was a switch from B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata-lineage) to B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (Victoria-lineage) in the season 2016/17, effectively causing a mismatch in each of the three studied seasons. In 2017/18 the only strain that was not immunologically covered by recent epidemics or the current vaccine composition was the influenza B Yamagata-lineage.

The majority of the vaccinated patients were adults. However, a major improvement to influenza disease burden may only be accomplished by extending vaccine recommendations to younger age groups that are immunologically more na\u00efve and thus more susceptible to infections [36], [25]. WHO recommendations for the use of tetravalent vaccines that contain two influenza B strains (Yamagata and Victoria) in addition to the two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) should be implemented in national vaccination guidelines as it was done in Germany as a result of the severity of the 2017/18 influenza season.",
