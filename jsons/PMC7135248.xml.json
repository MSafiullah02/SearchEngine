This proportion is similar to those in a previous influenza survey in Germany2 and a study on attendance during a hypothetical outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in New York City.3 Plans often account for workers' absence, be it due to illness, attending to relatives, or transport difficulties.
