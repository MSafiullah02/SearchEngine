Analytical microarrays are typically used to profile a complex mixture of proteins in order to measure binding affinities, specificities, and protein expression levels of the proteins in the mixture. In this technique, a library of antibodies, aptamers, or affibodies is arrayed on a glass microscope slide. The array is then probed with a protein solution. Antibody microarrays are the most common analytical microarray (Bertone and Snyder, 2005).",

There are two major recombinational cloning strategies that are used to create libraries of open reading frames (ORFs) in expression vectors (Phizicky et al., 2003). The first makes use of recombination in yeast. Open reading frames of interest are amplified such that they all contain common 5\u2032 and different common 3\u2032 ends. The ORFs are mixed with a linearized vector that contains ends identical to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the amplified ORFs. The mixture is then transformed into yeast where gap-mediated recombination occurs (Phizicky et al., 2003). The first yeast proteome collection was produced in this fashion (Zhu et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The other major cloning strategy makes use of the Gateway recombinational cloning system (Phizicky et al., 2003). The Gateway system takes advantage of the integration and excision properties of phage \u03bb in E. coli. \u03bb phage integrates into its hosts DNA by recombination between the \u03bb att P site and the host att B site. The recombination results in DNA with ends called att L and att R. Upon excision of the \u03bb phage, recombination between att L and att R results in the original att P and att B sites. The Gateway system takes advantage of these unique properties of \u03bb phage to create an expression vector with the ORF of interest via a two-step recombination reaction. First, components of \u03bb integration are mixed with the amplified ORF that contains two different directional att B sites. This mixture is then combined, in vitro, with a vector that contains corresponding att P sites. Recombination occurs and the resulting vector then contains two different att L sites. This vector is then combined with an expression vector that contains appropriate att R sites. Recombination occurs in vitro, and the ORF of interest is then in a useful expression vector. The Gateway system is quite flexible as it allows for easy shuttling of ORFs between different expression vectors. The Gateway system has been used to create ORF collections for genes from yeast (Gelperin et al., 2005), C. elegans (Reboul et al., 2003), and humans (Rual et al., 2004b).",

After expressing and purifying the proteins in a high-throughput fashion in budding yeast, the proteins were spotted onto glass slides (Zhu et al., 2001). Protein signals on the chips were quantified by probing the GST-HisX6 tags with anti-GST antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies.

Human ORFeome collections and microarrays have also been generated by Invitrogen. These ORFeomes are helpful in improving the annotation of genomes, and because they were created using Gateway technology, they exist in a flexible format that allows for the high-throughput expression of proteins in a number of different experimental systems.",

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Arg5,6 associates with specific nuclear and mitochondrial loci in vivo. Gel shift assays revealed that Arg5,6 binds to specific DNA fragments in vitro, and a common binding motif was found. Real time PCR experiments with Arg5,6 indicated that it may have a role in regulating gene expression.

Specifically, they created protein microarrays containing most of the human Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. These binding domains are known to interact with different epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), which themselves are involved in a wide variety of cellular responses. The activated receptors become phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues, which then become the sites for the SH2 and PTB domain binding. The human binding domain microarray of 159 proteins was probed with 66 fluorescently labeled peptides representing the binding sites of the epidermal growth factor receptors. The microarrays were probed with eight concentrations of each peptide, and the resulting fluorescence data was used to calculate dissociation constants to determine the binding affinities of the peptide-binding domain interactions. The accuracy of a sample of the dissociation constants calculations was confirmed with surface plasmon resonance experiments. From their experimental data, they constructed a quantitative EGFR interaction map. Their data not only confirmed previously known interactions, but also showed novel biophysical interactions of SHT2 and PTB domains with the epidermal growth factor receptor network. With their quantitative data, they found that different receptor tyrosine kinases differ in their level of selectivity when overexpressed, which they suggest may be a clue as to why some receptors have more oncogenic potential than others.",
