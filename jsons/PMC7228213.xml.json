About 80% of laboratory\u2010confirmed cases were mild and moderate cases in adults, including those with or without pneumonia, 13.8% of patients were severe illness, and 6.1% of patients were a critical illness.\n7\n Children infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were mostly mild cases and few severe cases have been reported.\n8\n Given that children are in a special immune state, we need to be alert to the occurrence of severe cases. In this study, we collected three children cases diagnosed with COVID\u201019 from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin. The clinical characteristics of these children were analyzed and reported to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of children during the epidemic of COVID\u201019.",

As Case 1 combined with supportive tonsillitis, ceftriaxone anti\u2010infection was used. Case 2 was given ribavirin antivirus treatment. All three cases were given interferon atomization, vitamin C, and oral Chinese medicine treatment.
