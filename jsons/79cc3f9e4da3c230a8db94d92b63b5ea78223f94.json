Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death. Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear. We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO. Of note, this is a \"living document,\" which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges. ASAIO Journal XXX; XX:00-00.",

[2] [3] [4] Of viral species, respiratory viruses, in particular, have periodically presented with widespread distribution of virus resulting in pandemics, with often overwhelming morbidity and mortality. 3, 5 We presently face such a situation with the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus. [6] [7] [8] The major viral pandemics of the last century, including those involving 1918 H1N1 and 2009 H1N1 influenza and 2003 SARS-CoV and 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV coronavirus, predominantly manifested as respiratory system illnesses with possible secondary cardiovascular and other end-organ system effects. 9 Although many patients develop a mild to moderate illness, a significant subset of patients develop severe progressive respiratory and occasionally cardiac failure, refractory to conventional therapies, including advanced ventilator management strategies. For these patients, the only plausible treatment strategy is artificial lung or circulatory support. From the initial clinical experience in China and in Italy, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection, also termed coronavirus disease 2019, that is COVID-19, has a disease natural history that results in severe respiratory and circulatory compromise for a significant portion of those infected. It is the specific goal of the present paper to provide a resource document to the clinical community regarding evolving best practice strategies for advanced pulmonary and cardiac support in patients with severe progressive COVID-19. Overall, the philosophy of the present paper is to be a living document-one gathering best practice information of the moment, which will be rapidly and continuously updated as improved strategies emerge. We first provide a brief background on the biology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, evolving modes of diagnosis, and valuable laboratory parameters to follow. We provide evolving information on medical therapies. We then focus on management of the severely compromised patient warranting artificial lung or circulatory support. Recommendations are offered for patient selection and details of appropriate therapeutic pulmonary or cardiac support.",

Moreover, if or when mutations have occurred in SARS-CoV-2, it is unknown whether these may have occurred within nonhuman animal reservoirs, or following human transfer. Recent studies, however, now point to pangolin species as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs. 14 SARS-CoV-2 is a single (+) stranded RNA virus whose replication is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 15 However, genomic single-stranded RNA also has messenger RNA function, such that it may be translated on ribosomes into a peptide sequence. Similar to the original SARS virus, also a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of binding cell surfacebound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is richly expressed on pneumocytes, as well as endothelial cells. 11, 16 This interaction facilitates viral intracellular entry. In addition, the viral spike protein has a polybasic cleavage site at a location between the spike subunits, which may be proteolytically cleaved; this is thought to enhance viral entry and infectivity. 17, 18 ",

However, clinical manifestations may be quite variable. Fever is a near-universal finding. However, although dyspnea is a common finding both in intensive care unit (ICU)-hospitalized as well as non-ICUhospitalized patients, it is unsurprisingly significantly and substantially more common in ICU patients. In addition, constitutional symptoms such as anorexia are more common in ICU patients. 22 Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of varying severity is the norm in ICU patients. A median P a O 2 /F I O 2 ratio of <150 was identified in ICU-hospitalized patients, and ratios were worse in non-survivors in comparison to survivors. 23 The documented incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was \u224820%. Biochemical evidence of myocardial injury was present in \u224815% of patients; further, overt shock was evident in <10% of patients. 24 As expected, ARDS and shock were more common in ICU-hospitalized patients. Systemic arterial blood pressure did not appear to relate to survival; however, inotrope/vasoconstrictor usage was substantially higher in ICU-hospitalized and non-survivor patients. 25 Moreover, the hemodynamic profiles of shock in these patients are unclear. Finally, as is common in other etiologies of shock and respiratory failure, dysfunction of other end-organs, such as the kidney and the liver, was found to be more common and more severe in ICU-hospitalized and non-survivor patient groups. In particular, acute kidney injury and its severity were highly correlated with poorer outcomes.",

They were experienced with the SARS epidemic and applied that experience early in the spread of the disease. Likewise, the medical sophistication of Italy appears underappreciated in the lay press. The Italian setup mostly focused on large hospitals with ICU preparedness, lacking a comprehensive plan on community medicine and small healthcare institutions. 29 Indeed, the first patient was diagnosed in a small city, Codogno. Following this, a \"Red Zone,\" with total limitation of social mobility, was instituted for containment of infectious spread. The case was particularly challenging since this patient was a young healthy athlete without any medical or epidemiological (travel to China or contact) risk factors. The first case immediately prompted the development of a task force for managing and limiting the outbreak on a Regional level. 30 The United States is early in its experience with COVID-19, but has per capita fatality rates that are, along with Germany, the lowest of those countries afflicted with a large burden of infected patients. The early German public health experience with COVID-19 is particularly noteworthy for the lowest mortality outcomes within the group of infected patients, but the reasons for this are unclear at this time. Unpublished communications suggest that this may be due, at least in part, to a younger COVID-19-infected population.",

To this end, a basic diagnostic algorithm for \"fever clinics,\" given the high sensitivity of fever as a sign of COVID-19, has been developed. 31 High-fidelity, sensitive, specific, and predictive diagnostic strategies are needed. It should be noted that current Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations reiterate that \"clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness\" as appropriate. Conversely, COVID testing should be employed for those with a high index of suspicion and for those at increased risk. 32 A hierarchy of \"priorities of testing\" is provided by the CDC. Current diagnostic strategies include obtaining samples for viral testing from the upper (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash) or lower (induced sputum, endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage) respiratory tract samples for via nucleic acid amplification tests, such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; as well as for bacterial or fungal cultures as is appropriate. 33, 34 Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 may be made via follow on nucleic acid sequencing, via detection of the specific N, E, S, and RdRP viral genes. For in-hospital patients, we recommend sending two specimens on two different days to ensure adequate specimen collection. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealing ground-glass opacities or consolidation consistent with the disease increases the clinical suspicion of disease. 19, 20 Basic monitoring includes pulse oximetry and telemetry for stable patients outside the intensive care unit, and more invasive monitoring with systemic arterial and central venous/pulmonary arterial (PA) catheters in the intensive care unit. Of note, for inpatients, continued viral detection and shedding has been reported which may also be monitored via blood and stool sampling. 35, 36 A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram (see following) can be performed if the patient presents with systemic arterial hypotension or overt shock. PA catheter placement may be useful in patients with shock as well (see following). We do not recommend routine endomyocardial biopsies, due to risks of cardiac structural injury (iatrogenic ventricular septal defect, right ventricular [RV] free wall rupture and cardiac tamponade, and tricuspid valve injury with regurgitation). In patients who have evidence of focal/regional cardiac injury, via electrocardiography or echocardiography, diagnostic left-sided cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography is reasonable.",

Although this has been currently universally recommended given absence of strong data for any other drugs, there is currently no randomized-controlled trial that has proven its efficacy. 41 With respect to therapies that are not directly antiviral, corticosteroids have been studied in a subset of patients from Wuhan with positive results (HR 0.38, CI, 0.20-072), in a retrospective study cohort of 201 patients. 42 Further prospective randomizedcontrolled trials are needed to study this further.

[50] [51] [52] Mechanical ventilation: noninvasive and invasive. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (MV) strategies, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), may be appropriate for short durations in patients with hypoxemia suboptimally treated by high-flow supplemental O 2 systems alone. As either a noninvasive or invasive mode of MV, CPAP increases basal (throughout the respiratory cycle, and thus evident even at end-expiration, the invasive analog being positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) intra-alveolar pressure, and thus, lung volume. Globally, this may manifest as an improvement from lower-normal to higher lung volumes in the setting of normal overall lung compliance, or in the setting of low overall lung compliance, from lower-to normal-higher lung volumes. MV recruits under-or non-ventilated alveoli that are otherwise yet perfused, and thus improves O 2 transfer of blood flowing past these alveoli, and the overall V/Q ratio. BiPAP, which is analogous to pressure-support invasive MV, provides CPAP plus additional input airway pressure during inspiration. This not only increases mean alveolar pressure and volume, but does so by augmenting the inspiratory flow rate, and for a fixed inspiratory time, the tidal volume. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a reasonable initial strategy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, provided that hypoxemia is not profound, and the anticipated duration of NIV support is not long. The issue with NIV is the need for patient cooperation. There is current concern that CPAP and BIPAP modes may potentiate aerosolization of the respiratory viral particles. Some institutional guidelines limit high-flow nasal cannula to <30 L/min, and avoid NIV, due to risk of staff infection, and further suggest that early intubation should be attempted. 53 The timing of such transition from NIV to invasive MV presently remains patient specific.",

Factors in these considerations include severity of gas exchange derangement, individual patient comorbidities, anticipated survivability of the COVID-19 infection, and availability of resources, all must be considered in determination of MV allocation to an individual patient.

Regarding the preliminary experience with COVID-19 which highlighted the discrepancy between gas exchange and lung mechanics (severe hypoxemia with normal compliance) some relevant physiologic and clinical points are noteworthy. First, several groups have (unpublished data) suggested that COVID-19 is associated with microvascular thrombosis in several tissue beds: pulmonary, coronary, and renal. Indeed, high D-dimer is associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19, which is indicative of microthrombosis in these arterial/arteriolar/capillary beds. 26 This may a contributory mechanism with respect to why severe hypoxemia is observed in the setting of normal or high lung compliance, since capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium both may be involved. In addition to hypoxemia, pulmonary vascular microthrombi, when severe, may also contribute to shock. 59 Second, because of refractory hypoxemia, most clinicians increase PEEP. However, high PEEP may result in alveolar overdistension in the setting of normal or high compliance. High PEEP also can augment pulmonary vascular impedance (creation of West Zone 1 lung; although if this incidentally happened to occur in unventilated lung zones and pulmonary blood flow were better redistributed to betterventilated lung zones, this might ameliorate hypoxemia), and reduce systemic venous return, both of which reduce RV stroke volume and cardiac output (CO). Conversely, decreased oscillatory lung loading via low tidal volume and distending pressure \"lung-protective\" ventilation may cause or exacerbate hypercapnia, permissive or otherwise.",

If invasive MV fails, a decision needs to be made quickly as to whether extracorporeal gas exchange is appropriate. Since COVID-19-associated respiratory failure is hypoxemic in nature, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is almost certainly the most appropriate extracorporeal strategy (in contrast to extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal). The decision to utilize ECMO, similar to that for MV above, relates to (1) anticipated benefit (failure of MV to achieve adequate oxygenation, or requirement of traumatic MV settings in order to achieve adequate oxygenation) in the background of organ systems not directly supported or treated by ECMO, (2) risks (most notably, local cannulation-related complications, and active or biochemical coagulopathy), and (3) ECMO supply availability and other institutional infrastructure, and (4) practitioner expertise. In the case of COVID-19, in particular, but in ECMO deployment in general as well, dysfunction of organ systems other than those that are ECMO-supported (e.g., hematological/immune, renal, hepatic) decreases the anticipated benefit and may even increase the risks of therapy. 60,61 ECMO support has well-recognized local cannulation site vascular risks-that is, both ischemic and bleeding.

            "text": "With respect to recently published literature, ECMO utilization in the setting of COVID-19 respiratory failure has been associated with poor outcomes (hospital survival well below 50%), although the number of cases has been too small to draw definitive conclusions. Most patients reported in the population from China died. 62 More recent data available to us, as yet unpublished, seem more encouraging, although we do not have data on survival to hospital discharge. Overall, we believe that in a high mortality scenario such COVID-19, ECMO would not significantly impact on the global outcome figures, rather should be discussed on a patient-specific individual basis. Our suggestion is that the decision to implement ECMO should follow a clear failure of invasive MV, paralytic agents, and prone positioning; however, this assessment should be rapid. The latter of these is to avoid dysfunction or failure of other organ systems, and we further recommend that in light of the pandemic status of COVID-19 and the generalized poorer outcomes of ECMO support when other organ system dysfunction occurs, that ECMO implementation generally should be restricted to those with isolated single organ system (pulmonary) dysfunction who are invasively mechanically ventilated \u22647 days. Each institution's experience and resources differ, as do the local and regional epidemiology of COVID-19; consequently, ECMO implementation in the setting of renal or hepatic failure must be assessed on a case-by-case basis (further discussion regarding institution in the setting of cardiac failure follows later in this document). We also mention emerging early experience to combine ECMO with means of modulating or removing cytokines, as yet a further extension of modalities for the sickest of patients with cytokine storm and severe cardiopulmonary compromise. 63 We now turn to the specific \"tactical\" aspects of ECMO, focusing on cannulation approaches, since the cannulation approach is one of the few important variables that can be not only controlled, but altered to optimize gas exchange. We initially focus on \"right-sided\" ECMO used for pulmonary support, that is, ECMO in which the right side of the circulation is exclusively accessed (the most common form of which is veno-venous [V-V] ECMO). Tables 1 and 2 provide a summary. Central versus peripheral. Central cannulation, that is, of the great vessels and generally via an open surgical approach, has the advantage of providing large cannula, with low resistance and high maximal volumetric flow rates. However, it is invasive and has greater periprocedural (not necessarily longer-term, though) bleeding risks. Moreover, central cannulation requires cardiothoracic surgeons to perform it. Peripheral cannulation generally cannot achieve the fluid mechanics of central cannulation. However, peripheral cannulation is most commonly percutaneous and has lower periprocedural bleeding risks. Finally, practitioners of a variety of specialties can be trained to perform peripheral cannulation procedures-i.e. cardiothoracic surgeons, interventional cardiologists, critical care anesthesiologists, and ICU physicians. Although central cannulation is hemodynamically advantageous (with respect to higher flow rates; hemodynamic support is not relevant in pure V-V ECMO), in light of its invasiveness, bleeding risks, and specialized training required, it is more reasonable to propose peripheral cannulation as the initial approach of choice for COVID-19-related respiratory failure. Percutaneous: single versus two cannula. For right-sided ECMO, either single cannula (dual-lumen) or dual cannula approaches exist. Advantages of the single cannula approach include reduced risks of local bleeding complications and the potential to ambulate. In the case of right atrial/ventricular inflow and pulmonary arterial outflow, lesser degrees of recirculation are present. This latter single cannula approach also provides RV mechanical circulatory support (MCS) (see below). However, overall volumetric flow rates may be lower, and image guidance during cannulation is necessary. In contrast, the two-cannula approach requires two venous cannulation sites and typically precludes the ability to ambulate. Moreover, recirculation is common, although it may occur with the single cannula approach if both inflow and outflow are in the systemic venous compartment. However, higher flow rates are achievable with the two-cannula approach, and image guidance-which often is not present under emergent circumstances-usually is not needed. The lack of need for image guidance means that unlike the single cannula approach, cannulation using the two-cannula technique does not require operating room or catheterization laboratory environments, and potential COVID-19 exposure of these vital spaces and their ancillary staff. Thus, we suggest that the two-cannula technique should be preferred for most institutions and circumstances. Bi-femoral approaches are particularly advantageous in terms of rapidity of deployment, avoidance of cannulating surgeons and physicians being positioned near the patient's oropharynx and endotracheal tube, and ease of subsequent prone positioning. However, under the current circumstances, we recommend each team use whatever cannulation technique is most familiar and comfortable, to minimize complications.",

Based upon the existing data, it is unclear whether shock occurs in a subset of hospitalized COVID-19infected patients with respiratory failure, or whether it may occur independent of respiratory failure. Unpublished communications to us suggest that shock occurs in a small but noteworthy (due to their dire clinical status) subset of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring at least mechanical ventilation. Because outcomes are clearly poorer when more organ systems are dysfunctional, we suggest that MCS ought to be highly selectively implemented in COVID-19-infected patients. Yet, some patients, particularly those who are relatively younger, with fewer underlying comorbid conditions and good overall short-and long-term life expectancy, may be appropriate candidates for MCS. Given the range of clinical profiles in patients with COVID-19, we recommend early adoption of an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating advanced heart failure specialists, a lesson learned from ongoing efforts in the arena of complex cardiogenic shock. 68, 69 The immediate discussion is restricted to the left-sided circulation because decision-making here is even more complex. It is first important to determine whether left-sided cardiac dysfunction is present. In patients with shock, echocardiography (see following discussion) is particularly useful, and pulmonary arterial catheters are helpful as well, both for blood flow measurements as well blood gas measurements from different circulatory compartments. Underlying congenital or acquired structural or coronary arterial disease is assumed to be absent for the purposes of this discussion. If the systemic arterial blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <60 mmHg) is decreased, or high doses of inotropic and vasoactive agents are required to achieve a normal-range systemic arterial blood pressure, then echocardiography should be undertaken. If the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) is at least moderately reduced (LVEF <40%), this is clearly abnormal, and in the acute setting, with a non-dilated LV and normal-range LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), stroke volume would be substantially reduced. In addition, invasive hemodynamic monitoring assessments, such as those provided by pulmonary arterial catheters, often are helpful in discerning whether intrinsic LV dysfunction is present (LV stroke work may be calculated; see discussion below).",

Regardless of whether systemic arterial hypotension is thought to be cardiogenic with LV failure, distributive, or mixed, the LVEF generally is a useful index to use in order to determine whether MCS is reasonable. If LVEF is high or even normal in the setting of systemic arterial hypotension, and the LVEDV and heart rate are normal, then the CO is normal or elevated, and MCS would have to be able (with native output) exceed that in order to have a hemodynamic benefit. In contrast, if the LVEF is low, then for a normal LVEDV and heart rate, the CO is reduced despite optimal LV preload, and MCS may be reasonable. If the LVEF is reduced, and high doses of inotropes are required to treat systemic arterial hypotension, MCS for the LV may be appropriate in highly selected COVID-19 patients. However, with rare exception, shock with a normal LVEF (predominantly distributive) should not be treated with MCS, unless volumetric flow rates well in excess of the native CO can be achieved.",

As stated earlier, PRSW or stroke work index 70 is the gold-standard index for the assessment of LV systolic function, being superior to systolic ventricular elastance measures. 69, 71 Determination of PRSW requires a range of LVEDVs to be studied, but for a given LVEDV, a particular SW may be used as an isolated data point. LV power (CPO) is the closest clinical correlate to SW (being LV work per unit time) and is clinically calculated as MAP multiplied by CO. 71 This is analogous to electrical power, which for a simple circuit with a single battery and resistor is equal to current (flow) multiplied by voltage (pressure difference), or the square of the current (flow) multiplied by resistance (systemic vascular resistance). An important caveat in using CPO is that it is not a per beat assessment, in that heart rate is incorporated. Tachycardia commonly observed in the majority of shock may limit decreases in CPO, even when per LV dysfunction is evident on a per beat basis.",

The relative advantages of central versus peripheral cannulation have been discussed above. However, unlike right-sided ECMO, systemic arterial cannulation is employed. Ischemic extremity complications are far more common with peripheral arterial cannulation than central cannulation, which reduces the relative advantages of central cannulation. Perhaps more importantly, lower extremity arterial cannulation may result in differential hypoxemia when hypoxemic respiratory failure is present, wherein the LV ejects hypoxemic pulmonary venous return into the aortic root/coronary arteries/proximal aortic arch, whereas the lower body is perfused with normoxemic or hyperoxemic postgas exchanger blood flow. Consequently, decision-making with respect to central versus peripheral cannulation for V-A ECMO is more complex than for V-V ECMO alone. Hybrid V-V/V-A ECMO approaches may be reasonable under such circumstances. However, hybrid configurations are more complex and resource-intensive, typically requiring continuous bedside attendance by a perfusionist or ECMO specialist. Short-term paracorporeal left ventricular assist devices with either central or peripheral cannulation; short-term cathetermounted left ventricular assist devices (Impella). The principal advantages of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) over V-A ECMO in shock are direct LV unloading, and more homogeneous distribution of blood flow through the systemic arterial circulation. Direct (inflow cannula within the left side of the heart, and particularly the LV) LV unloading is more effective in reduction of LVEDV, 71 and consequently, LV diastolic and systolic pressures (reduction of systolic pressures being a manifestation of the Frank-Starling mechanism); this may be advantageous relative to indirect (inflow cannula proximal to/ upstream of the left side of the heart) unloading (e.g., via V-A ECMO) vis-\u00e0-vis greater reduction of pathologic load-induced signals and resultant mechanotransduction.",

[75] [76] [77] Even when LV distension does occur, drainage through a rightsided PA vent catheter 78 can decompress the LV, which runs counter to the aforementioned modeling studies. What is less controversial and clearer, based upon a review of physiologic concepts and the literature regarding LV distension in V-A ECMO, is that MCS approaches which employ left-sided circuit inflow (\"direct\" unloading) generally are more effective in achieving LV unloading than those which employ right-sided circuit inflow. 71 Consequently, in some patients, LVAD-based approaches may be superior to V-A ECMO.",

            "text": "In addition, when gas exchangers are used in concert, this \"modular\" approach permits isolated treatment (as well as de-escalation) of cardiac and pulmonary failure. However, these approaches are more technically demanding and require a high level of practitioner and institutional expertise. As is the case for V-A ECMO, we recommend that only highly selected patients with COVID-19 be considered for short-term LVAD support. Because the Impella catheter-mounted micro-axial VADs are substantially different from other pump mechanisms insofar as the pump mechanisms themselves are intracorporeal and miniaturized, we briefly mention two salient features. First, percutaneous transfemoral placement may be performed at the bedside under echocardiographic guidance, rather in than in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. In pandemic conditions, this may be useful. Second, placement via an axillary artery approach, using the newest iteration of introducer sheaths and securing devices, results in secure pump position, which may facilitate safer prone positioning. With further reference to the range of Impella devices, a wide range of delivered volumetric flow rates may be achieved. The original Impella 2.5 device generally may not provide adequate flow for the severely compromised shock patient for which robust LV MCS is required. The Impella CP device is better with a peak flow of 4.3 L/m. The Impella 5.0 and 5.5 devices, each of which may be introduced via side-grafts on the axillary artery, are capable of providing flows of 5.0 and 5.5 L/m, respectively, that is, levels of flow close to those achievable with surgically implanted LVADs, all via a minimally invasive platform. Finally, secure pump positioning achieved with devices inserted via axillary artery side-grafts has the advantage of longer-term MCS, in patients with slow recovery of LV function. Experience with Impella in combination with ECMO, that is, \"ECPELLA,\" to enhance unloading and boost support is just beginning to emerge in severly compromised COVID patients. 79 Right ventricular support. Respiratory failure commonly causes an increase in the pulmonary vascular impedance, increasing RV afterload. In some cases, this can occur to such an extent (\"afterload mismatch\") that even in the setting of normal intrinsic RV contractility, the RVEF and output may decrease substantially (cor pulmonale). In such patients in the acute setting, attempting to treat the underlying etiology of impaired gas exchange using V-V ECMO alone may not be sufficient. This is because V-V ECMO recirculation is exacerbated by reduced RVEF and tricuspid regurgitation. In cases of cor pulmonale with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, we suggest that strategies to support the RV are appropriate. For patients who may require proning, percutaneous RVADs using femoro-femoral approaches, can be used with an oxygenator. The single cannula (e.g., Protek Duo) approach to this offers the advantages of peripheral cannulation via one site, and with minimal recirculation. Central approaches may be reasonable in patients in whom high-flow rates cannot be achieved. If high-flow rates are thought not to be achievable with a single cannula approach, then V-V ECMO plus a device such as the Impella RP may be reasonable. 80 ",

We emphasize that V-V ECMO is NOT an alternative to mechanical ventilation or proning.

V-V ECMO should only be considered when mechanical ventilation is failing. Further, from a resource utilization and relative risk perspective, moving to ECMO is a resource-intensive and resource-consuming procedure that should be utilized with careful consideration. To date, survival on ECMO for cardiorespiratory failure is highly variable in COVID patients and significantly less than the previously reported 40% at most centers. 84 How to approach therapeutic futility for termination? During times of limited resources observing no lung or cardiac recovery after 14 days on ECMO can largely be considered futile, and the patient can be returned to conventional management. Of course, individual patient decisions must be guided by the overall consensus related to a given patient, in a given clinical context, by the treatment team involved. Of note, the \"SAVE\"-Survival After Veno-Arterial ECMO, scoring system has been developed by ELSO and the Department of Intensive Care at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, to provide estimates of survival for adults undergoing V-A ECMO. 85 However, we caution that this was developed based solely on consideration of patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. As of this writing, no data exists as to its translatable utility in compromised COVID patients on ECMO.
