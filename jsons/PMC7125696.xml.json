These guidelines, which outline specific strategies for prevention and control of influenza in acute care facilities, supplement CDC's 2008 infection control recommendations (4). Despite these strategic references, at least 48 cases of influenza A (H1N1) strain have been reported among health care personnel since the initial outbreak, indicating that compliance with the CDC's recommendations may be lower than desired (5). Although there is limited and controversial evidence regarding the effectiveness of either surgical or N95 masks in reducing transmission of the influenza virus, studies of occupational exposures during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak suggest that the wearing of either surgical or N95 masks might be protective in the health care setting (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). A recent study on the use of surgical masks compared to N95 masks by nurses in Canada demonstrated similar rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (11). Influenza infection control is particularly important in the emergency department (ED) because both index cases and more severe cases are expected to present to the ED, and the phenomenon of ED crowding continues to increase at an alarming rate across the United States (12).",

EMR systems have been successfully used for improving adherence to clinical guidelines such as pressure ulcer prevention, decreasing adverse drug reactions, and monitoring of infectious diseases, as well as compliance with pneumonia guidelines (13, 14).
