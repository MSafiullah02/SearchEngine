The threat of terrorism has many faces and violence can arise from all ideological extremes. The authors present the theoretical model and current empirical validation of the Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol (TRAP-18), a structured professional judgment instrument for those engaged in risk assessment of persons of concern for acts of terrorist violence. It can be used independently of a particular ideology. The TRAP-18 consists of 8 proximal warning behaviors and 10 distal characteristics, and has been designed to help prioritize the imminency of risk in specific cases, and therefore determine the intensity of monitoring and active management a case requires. Research has demonstrated excellent interrater reliability, and promising content, criterion, discriminant, and predictive validity. More research is in progress. The TRAP-18 is currently used by counterterrorism experts in North America and Europe. It offers a useful approach for professionals who may be assessing and treating individuals of national security concern. Zusammenfassung Terrorismus, insbesondere durch sog. Einzelt\u00e4ter, gilt sowohl in Nordamerika als auch in Europa als wesentliche Bedrohung der nationalen Sicherheit. Die Bedrohung durch Terrorismus hat viele Gesichter, und Gewalt kann aus allen extremen Ideologien entstehen. Die Autoren stellen in diesem Beitrag den theoretischen Hintergrund und die aktuellen empirischen Erkenntnisse zum Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol (TRAP-18) vor. Der TRAP-18 folgt dem Ansatz der strukturierten, professionellen Risikobeurteilung und ist zur Einsch\u00e4tzung von Personen geeignet, die f\u00fcr m\u00f6gliche terroristische Gewaltakte infrage kommen. Dabei kann das Instrument unabh\u00e4ngig von einer bestimmten Ideologie angewendet werden. Der TRAP-18 besteht aus 8 proximalen und 10 distalen Faktoren. Er wurde entwickelt, um den Anwender in konkreten F\u00e4llen bei der Priorisierung eines sich abzeichnenden Risikos zu unterst\u00fctzen und dadurch die Intensit\u00e4t des Monitorings und aktiven Managements in einem Fall festzulegen.

The challenge starts with the insight that a legally or scientifically accepted definition of terrorism that serves as a gold standard is missing (Leygraf 2014) . But ideologies which drive such acts of violence toward noncombatant civilians share two common characteristics (Meloy 2017) . First, they are acts of targeted violence, that is, intended and purposeful events which are virtually always the culmination of a pathway toward violence. These actions are not impulsive and typically not a reaction to an imminent threat, which define most violence among individuals (Meloy 2006) . Second, as Nedopil (2014) has noted, not only is a target selected but also an audience. The terrorist hopes that society will respond with insecurity, fear and a growing mistrust toward each other.

Nonetheless, lone actors are inspired and radicalized by writings and postings of likeminded individuals and charismatic leaders through virtual and face-to face contact.

A.A. seemed to have had ties and support from IS (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Justiz und Verbraucherschutz 2017).

Bouhana et al. (2018) addressed the extent to which risk assessment tools and processes should be tailored to a specific ideology.

Prevention is attainable if the focus is upon fact-based behaviors of concern, and threat management is employed to mitigate such behaviors . Threat assessment and violence risk assessment are similar but do also emphasize different aspects. Threat assessment and management focuses upon the identification, assessment, and management of a POC in real time-with close attention paid to the target and the situation-while the traditional task of \"violence risk assessment\" is the determination of relative risk in an individual at a particular point in time by determining the base rate of violence for the group within which he or she belongs.

Since a structured approach and typology of such warning behaviors was missing in the threat assessment literature, they were organized and operationalized after intensive research on targeted or intended violence, discussions with colleagues, and the casework experience of the original authors. The 8 warning behaviors capture behavioral or psychological patterns which constitute change and may evidence accelerating risk (Meloy et al. ). They contain dynamic rather than static factors, since the former typically offer more substantial contributions to the assessment and management of short-term violence which is usually the focus of threat assessment (Douglas and Skeem 2005) .

They were significantly more fixated, creative and innovative, and failed to have a sexually intimate pair bond; and were significantly less likely to have displayed pathway warning behavior that was discovered beforehand and be dependent on a virtual community of likeminded individuals. Effect sizes were small to medium (\u03a6 = 0.19-0.32). Detectable pathway behavior was evident in 72% of the successful and in 93% of the thwarted group. Whether this last difference was based on luck, stealth, or inadequate intelligence gathering is not clear. The significantly more prevalent fixation warning behavior in the successful attackers describes an intensity of pursuit and preoccupation with the subject, often accompanied by social deterioration in love and work and the tendency to socially withdraw. A history of failed sexual pair bonding in general-like in the group of successful attackers-also lowers the risk of an intimate becoming familiar with one's activities and disrupting the operation. On the other hand, a failure to establish long lasting relationships could intensify fixation on a subject or a person as a substitute for real relationships. Less dependence on the virtual community means a lessened chance of having one's postings or social media communication picked up by a third party or discovered by authorities.

The investigation is still ongoing and final conclusions are not warranted, but at the point of this writing there is no evidence of a directly communicated threat beforehand. To be clear, a directly communicated threat should always be seriously assessed; but the lack of such a threat in any case should not be mistaken as an \"all clear sign.\" Monahan and Steadman (1996) first introduced a weather analogy to violence risk assessment which appears in the context of the TRAP-18 to be a useful metaphor: The presence of a cluster of TRAP-18 distal characteristics, along with the absence of all proximal warning behaviors, indicate there may be storm clouds on the horizon. It is still uncertain if a storm will form, but a \"Watch\" needs to be initiated. In the world of threat assessment, this means that the case should be monitored and reviewed on a regular basis. Monitoring should be done contemporaneously in both virtual and terrestrial worlds. The case does not yet warrant more commitment of active management resources. The presence of any one proximal warning behavior, on the other hand, means the storm may be in one's backyard. A \"Warning\" needs to be initiated. In the world of threat assessment, this means active management: face-to-face interview with the POC and/or collateral interviews with family or peers; review of records (e.g., military, criminal, residence, police incidents, employment); social media monitoring; civil commitment, release, and discharge planning; safety plan development for school, work, home and the community at large; and obtaining signed consents to communicate with the POC's mental health professional to monitor progress .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 846, "end": 873, "text": "Monahan and Steadman (1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current state of the science on the TRAP-18"}, {"text": "As practitioners, we are the first to acknowledge that any given case is far more complex than empirical results or analogies might suggest.

Further research is warranted and potential weaknesses of the TRAP-18 (e.g., lack of protective factors) need to be taken into account, but the results so far seem promising. There are other instruments used to assess risk of terrorist violence, including the ERG 22+ (Extremism Risk Guidelines; Lloyd and Dean 2015) and the VERA (Violent Extremism Risk Assessment; Pressman 2009). Multimethod approaches are best for the assessment of terrorism risk, and other instruments that correlate with violence risk, such as the HCR-20 V3 (Historical-Clinical-Risk; Douglas et al. 2013 ) and the PCL-R (Hare 2003) are also recommended.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 886, "end": 905, "text": "Douglas et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 922, "end": 933, "text": "(Hare 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and further directions"}, {"text": "The application of instruments is only the first step.
