Enough to put you off your gnocci, perhaps, but plenty of scope for health improvement messages, which may well be applicable to many other countries. So an evaluation of an English initiative designed to make every contact with a health worker count towards healthier living, is welcomed, although it is clear that much more effort is needed to enable such initiatives to be effective on an industrial scale, if we are ever to achieve that elusive \u2018fully engaged\u2019 scenario for our populations. Whilst keen to promote equity and to remove discrimination, we are often guilty by neglect: a paper in this issue that explores access to public toilets reminds readers of the needs of people with disabilities, some of which would be missed without the participation of the potential users themselves. A review article about folic acid intake and a possible link with pancreatic cancer sets out clearly the evidence, some of which is conflicting, to date. And we make no apology for including another paper that reports on the Wenchuan earthquake, this one attempting to identify the determinants of post-traumatic stress disorder, which may have relevance to the handling of many other major traumatic events around the globe.\n",
