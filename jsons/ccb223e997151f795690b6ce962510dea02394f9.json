The updated results in section 3.2 showcase the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S., while 18 more clusters were detected using the updated daily case data. Notably, Manhattan became the epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S., with a staggering 25% of the confirmed cases across the country.

First, there are many counties that were included in the clusters that did not contain any reported cases of COVID-19; however, this is due to the scanning process (an artifact of the statistic) and is circumvented by reporting the relative risk for the locations that belong to each cluster. Second, the case data only include confirmed cases and it is important to highlight that suspected and probable cases are not considered due to unavailability and uncertainty. Therefore, the true magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and will not be known for some time. Third, more local-level surveillance and studies are required to understand the transmission dynamics of the current and future emerging clusters; as SaTScan is an exploratory statistic. Fourth, COVID-19 is more severe for the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions. Future studies can implement case/control cluster techniques with death and case counts (e.g. space-time Bernoulli models), while simultaneously adjusting for age and other relevant covariates. It is also possible to adjust for younger age groups to examine if mitigation guidelines have been successful in any way. Finally, this study utilized COVID-19 case data up until March 27th, 2020.

COVID-19 and general infectious disease surveillance can benefit from our prospective approach by monitoring outbreaks as they happen as new data becomes available. We emphasize the importance of focusing surveillance on emerging and active clusters during epidemics, essentially dismissing previous clusters that do not threaten public health that would appear in a retrospective analysis. Furthermore, data sharing and availability is crucial and allows a variety of researchers to contribute to our knowledge of COVID-19 and epidemiology, in general.
