First reported in China at the end of 2019, this outbreak rapidly spread throughout the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In the absence of approved therapies or vaccines to prevent or treat this infection, its rapid dissemination has overwhelmed public healthcare systems worldwide, causing severe economic and social distress. The previous high mortality outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012 illustrate that the emergence of novel viruses is not an isolated occurrence. However, the former outbreaks differed substantively from COVID-19, which can be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals. Currently, the primary tool to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 is social distancing, and an effective antiviral pharmacologic agent would be an important clinical and public health tool.",

Host survival is dependent upon key factors including cellular mechanisms of innate antiviral immune response, intended to counter virus replication until virus-specific lymphocytes can eliminate the infection. Therefore, the development of therapeutic intervention strategies that augment these intrinsic, early broad-spectrum antiviral mechanisms is desirable. Although the biology, life cycle, and pathogenesis of different viruses are widely divergent, IFNs activate protective mechanisms aimed at both virus control and elimination. Administration of IFNs can be used for prophylaxis as well as early therapy, predicated on the principle of supplementing to compensate for insufficient IFN production or activity that might be actively blocked by the virus.",

            "text": "For decades, type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) have been explored as mediators of rapid, innate antiviral protection. In 2003, a novel group of three cytokines, now known as type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs), was discovered that act independently of type I IFNs to establish antiviral resistance in cells (Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2003) . An additional member of this family (IFN-\u03bb4) was discovered in 2013 (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . Most of the information on the function of IFN-\u03bbs has been generated using mouse models and thus has to be critically evaluated in relation to human disease (Ye et al., 2019) . The distinctive actions of type I and type III IFNs are achieved through the engagement of separate nonoverlapping heteromeric receptor complexes: IFNAR complex (with IFNAR1/IFNAR2 subunits) for all type I IFNs and IFNL complex (with IFNLR1/IL10R2 subunits) for all type III IFNs ( Fig. 1) . Signaling pathways and sets of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) induced by these IFNs are remarkably similar but not redundant (Crotta et al., 2013; Galani et al., 2017) . IFNAR is expressed on all cells, while IFNLR, limited by IFNLR1 expression, is restricted to epithelial cells and a subset of immune cells, including neutrophils. Due to these specific expression patterns, type I IFNs provide a systemic response, and IFN\u03bbs guard epithelial surfaces (Broggi et al., 2020; Fig. 1) .",

In mice, IFN-\u03bb was found to be more effective than IFN-\u03b1 in preventing and treating influenza virus infection, with no increase in inflammation and tissue damage as compared with IFN-\u03b1 (Davidson et al., 2016; Galani et al., 2017) . IFN-\u03bb was also more potent than IFN-\u03b1 in restricting viral dissemination from nasal epithelium to the upper respiratory tract (Klinkhammer et al., 2018) . Clinical trials of IFN-\u03bb for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection documented fewer and milder side effects, but equal efficacy, when compared with IFN\u03b1-based therapies (Muir et al., 2014) .

            "text": "With no time to spare for new pharmaceutical developments, the race is on for the repurposing of existing drugs. A compelling case can be made for IFN-\u03bb-based therapeutics. Pegylated IFN-\u03bb1 (peg-IFN-\u03bb1) is the only IFN-\u03bb currently available as a therapeutic agent. In vitro, treatment with IFN-\u03bb showed potency against a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV. The main function of IFN-\u03bb is to prevent viral infection by establishing an antiviral state and, if infected, to slow viral replication and dissemination. In contrast to IFNAR, the IFNLR is largely absent on resting immune cells in humans and mice (with the notable exception of neutrophils [Blazek et al., 2015; Broggi et al., 2017; Espinosa et al., 2017] and human B cells [Goel et al., 2020] ), allowing to avoid or minimize systemic inflammation caused by treatment with type I IFNs (Broggi et al., 2020;  Fig. 1 ). Severe lung inflammation and tissue damage are hallmarks of COVID-19, significantly contributing to mortality from this infection (Mehta et al., 2020) ; thus, enhancement of inflammation and cytokine storm must be avoided. However, it remains to be elucidated whether IFNLR can be up-regulated upon stimulation or in a highly inflamed environment, increasing the risk of possible adverse effects of IFN-\u03bb on human cells (Espinosa et al., 2017; Goel et al., 2020) . The absence of pro-inflammatory effects in the lungs (Davidson et al., 2016; Forero et al., 2019; Galani et al., 2017) is one of the most important arguments for the specific advantage of IFN-\u03bb over type I IFNs as a treatment option for COVID-19. However, it is very important to establish if immune cells are responsive to IFN-\u03bb in COVID-19, as Figure 1 . Potential benefits of using type III IFNs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex, IFNAR, which is comprised of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits. IFNAR activation induces expression of ISGs and triggers pro-inflammatory responses via the recruitment and activation of immune cells. This promotes an antiviral state in the host, but as IFNAR is expressed on all cells, the administration of type I IFN can have serious systemic side effects. In contrast, type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb1-4) signal through a distinct receptor complex, IFNLR, which consists of IL10R2 and IFNLR1 subunits. IFNLR1 expression is restricted to epithelial cells and a subset of immune cells, including neutrophils. Therefore, type III IFN administration as a prophylactic treatment or at an early stage of COVID-19 would result in ISG expression and antiviral response localized to epithelial cells, reducing side effects and inflammation associated with the systemic action of type I IFNs.",
