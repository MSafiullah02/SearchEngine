On January 21, 2020, the first imported novel coronavirus pneumonia case was confirmed in Sichuan province. In contrast, on January 16, the hospital already initiated the preparation for epidemic prevention and control, including an emergency plan, organization of expert groups for medical treatment, epidemic monitoring, screening and triage, remote consultation, personnel training, personal protective equipment (PPE) reserves, and other detailed arrangements such as isolation wards extension, workflow, and patient path design. At the same time, based on our previous experience, a fever screening and triage station was set up at the emergency department (ED). All these rapid reactions benefit from the emergency response mechanism formed in disaster in the past dozen years, such as the SARS outbreak in 2003, the bird flu outbreak in 2009, and the three tremendous earthquakes in 2008, 2012, and 2017. Moreover, in 2018, the China International Emergency Medical Team (Sichuan), mainly established by our hospital, has been certified as an Emergency Medical Team by the World Health Organization.3 In other words, the whole hospital was preparing for a potential emergency in an orderly and routine way. At that period, most people stayed in the peace and the happiness of the approaching Lunar Chinese New Year.",

To solve the problem of material shortage in a short period, a strict PPEs management plan was implemented. A four-level risk classification and PPEs practice guidance were established in strict accordance with the protection guideline and some research recommendations.5,6 PPE resources rationing was induced in the epidemic prevention and control areas (fever clinic, triage area), as well as the regular working areas. Without any exceptional condition, a surgical mask was dispensed every 4 h, while only one N95 mask would be provided per shift in high-risk areas.",

After completing a self-evaluation questionnaire containing disease symptoms and epidemiological history, patients can receive a free online evaluation and response from doctors within 6 h. Publicity information was released through social media, and the public was advised to reduce unnecessary hospital visits. The platform received approximately 500 online visits every day, and it helped reduce unnecessary runs on medical resources. On the first day of the outpatient service resume, the number of visits was less than 2000, which was down 90% percent from the same period last year, and the number of visits to fever clinics remained stable at approximately 100 cases per day. Therefore, the decrease in population density in the hospital helped to reduce the pressure of epidemic prevention and control significantly.",
