            "text": "Cattle are highly susceptible to congestive right heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension is synonymous with an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), a product of steady-state vascular resistance. The most commonly recognized cause of pulmonary hypertension in cattle is hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and remodeling associated with high-altitude exposure. Respiratory disease, however, may also lead to increased mPAP by predisposing affected individuals to alveolar hypoxia (Holt and Callan, 2007) and, in severe cases, reducing pulmonary vascular capacity through fibrosis and obliteration of pulmonary vessels. Feedlot cattle treated for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) were three times more likely to die of congestive right heart failure than cattle that did not require treatment (Neary et al., 2016a). It has also been determined that cattle with the greatest mPAP as suckling calves typically have the greatest mPAP through the confined feeding phase (Neary et al., 2015); consequently, interventions that reduce mPAP in the cow\u2013calf phase may have beneficial carryover health effects as cattle enter the next phase of production.",

These calves were a result of a fresh in vitro and conventional embryo transfer program that was transferred into commercial black-hided dams. All recipients were second-calf heifers. Calving took place on a dormant pasture containing WW-B.Dahl Old World Bluestem (Bothriochloa bladhii) and Bermuda (Cynodon dactylon) grasses. Cows were monitored every 3 h for signs of calving difficulty and assistance provided as necessary. Once all cows had calved, the cow\u2013calf pairs were moved to corn stalks until March 30, 2017. Cows were transported to a dry-lot setting for 7 d, so calves could be processed and resorted prior to being placed on nonirrigated wheat pasture. Cows were rotated to multiple wheat pastures as forage availability dictated. In general, conditions were fairly dry during the pre-weaning, foraging phase.",

Blood was collected in 10 mL glass tubes containing the anticoagulant EDTA. The tubes were inverted five times before storage in an insulated container cooled with ice packs. Flexible, saline-filled polyethylene catheter tubing (1.3 m length and external and internal diameters of 17 and 12 mm, respectively) was then fed through the needle and into the jugular vein. A pressure transducer (TranStar DPT, Smiths Medical ASD, Inc., Dublin, OH) connected the catheter and oscilloscope (BM5Vet, Bionet America, Inc. Tustin, CA). The change in the pressure waveform that occurred as the catheter tip was advanced through the right atrium, right ventricle, and finally into the pulmonary artery was monitored on the oscilloscope. The jugular vein, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery have distinct pressure waveforms. Blood samples were shipped overnight in an insulated container lined with icepacks and a complete blood count performed the next day (West Texas A & M Diagnostic Laboratory, Amarillo, TX). Plasma protein was assessed by refractometry. Plasma fibrinogen was estimated by using an established rapid heat precipitation micromethod (Millar et al., 1971).

Two backwards step-wise linear regression models that screened phenotypic and blood leukogram variables for association with the outcome variable mPAP were performed. Variables were screened for a univariable association with mPAP. Those that had a probability of a type 1 error of 0.20 or less were included in the full regression model. The phenotypic variables included treatment for respiratory disease, weaning weight (calculated with a 4% shrink), sex (bull or heifer), and age. Multiple BRD treatments were not accounted for in the analyses due to the small number of calves that this involved. The blood leukogram variables included concentrations of leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes), erythrocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, plasma protein, and fibrinogen, and the ratio of neutrophils-to-lymphocytes. The marginal means were calculated and plotted with the observed values against mPAP.

Perhaps, the greatest environmental difference is that the calves in our study were managed in a confinement or dry-lot system rather than a traditional pasture-based system. Research conducted at the same facility on the previous year\u2019s calf crop reported that confinement was deleterious to calf health (Burson, 2017). Although the calves in our study appeared healthy when mPAP was measured, the possibility that subclinical disease or long-term sequela of a prior infection contributed to an increase in mPAP cannot be ruled out.",

A recent evaluation of mPAP obtained from over 2,400 bulls at an altitude of 2,255 m reported that Red Angus bulls had the second greatest mPAP among the 10 different beef breeds and breed-crosses studied (Crawford et al., 2017). This may be partly attributable to the relatively greater frequency of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 2A (HIF2A) isoform in the Red Angus breed (Heaton et al., 2016), which has been associated with increased risk for pulmonary hypertension in Angus cattle (Newman et al., 2015). Red Angus and Angus cattle had the second and fifth greatest frequencies of the HIF2A isoform associated with pulmonary hypertension among the 46 breeds evaluated (Heaton et al., 2016).",

Under normoxic conditions, HIF proteins are degraded, but under hypoxic conditions HIF proteins are protected from degradation and have numerous downstream effects. Missense mutations of EPAS1 affecting the oxygen-dependent degradation domain cause a gain-of-function. There has been speculation that HIF proteins may be responsible for hematopoietic stem cell activation, from which monocytes are derived (Florentin and Dutta, 2017). If so, the positive association between blood monocyte concentration and mPAP may be attributable to EPAS1 variants within the calves tested.",

In one study, patients with primary pulmonary hypertension had impaired fibrinolytic activity (Welsh et al., 1996). In another study of human subjects exposed to high altitude, plasma fibrinogen and fibrinolytic activity increased regardless of whether or not an individual developed pulmonary hypertension; however, individuals with pulmonary hypertension had a significantly greater concentration of other pro-coagulant variables such as platelet adhesiveness, and clotting factors V and VIII (Singh and Chohan, 1972). This suggests that an increase in fibrinogen per se does not predispose to pulmonary thrombi but is facilitated by the presence of other pro-coagulant factors that were not measured in our study. The lower fibrinogen in calves with the greatest mPAP may be attributable to activated coagulation pathways within the pulmonary vasculature and, consequently, the consumption of fibrinogen.",
