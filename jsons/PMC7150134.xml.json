            "text": "Adenoviruses (Ad) are a large family of nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. At least 47 serotypes of human adenovirus have been isolated, as well as related animal viruses including avian, canine, and bovine types. In humans, the most common serotypes generally cause mild, self-limiting infections of the respiratory tract or gut (Horwitz, 1996). Adenovirus has served as an important model system for studying many aspects of molecular biology, and a large body of knowledge has accumulated that allows it to be readily manipulated in the laboratory (for an extensive review of Ad biology, see Shenk, 1996). Many features of this viral system, including the ability to infect a wide variety of nondividing cells, a large capacity for insertion of DNA, ease of production and stability of the viral particles, and the high viral titers that can be produced, make Ad-based vectors especially useful in gene transfer. Vectors based on several Ad serotypes have been used for gene expression work both in vitro and in vivo.\n",

            "text": "The adenoviral particle consists of an icosahedral protein capsid encasing a double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 36 kb (see Fig. 1\n). The most abundant viral protein is hexon, which makes up most of the outer shell of the virus (van Oostrum and Burnett, 1985). At each vertex is a complex composed of the penton base and fiber proteins, both of which interact with cellular receptors during the process of virus infection (Philipson et al., 1968; Bergelson et al., 1997; Tomko et al., 1997; Wickham et al., 1993). Several minor viral proteins also contribute to the capsid and may play roles in capsid assembly and in viral chromosome packaging. Ad DNA is packaged in a complex with several viral proteins (Mirza and Weber, 1982), and each end of the chromosome is covalently attached to a single molecule of terminal protein (TP) (Rekosh et al., 1977). TP acts as a primer for DNA synthesis (Van der Vliet, 1995) and also serves to anchor the viral chromosome to the nuclear matrix (Schaack et al., 1990).",

The most important regulator of viral growth is the immediate-early E1a protein, a promiscuous transcriptional activator that interacts with many cellular transcription factors (reviewed by Jones, 1995). E1a both activates further viral gene expression and modifies host cell regulation to drive the cell into S phase, which ensures that sufficient precursors for viral DNA and protein will be available. Deletion of the E1a gene blocks most viral gene expression as well as DNA synthesis and therefore renders Ad replication defective. Infection by E1-deleted Ad vectors often does not cause cytotoxic effects or grossly perturb the underlying cell biology; indeed, such vectors have been approved for administration to human subjects in many gene therapy protocols. These vectors are therefore useful in studies of protein function in intact cells, and most recombinant Ads now in use are E1 deleted.",

Instead, these proteins are involved in evading the host antiviral immune response. E3 encodes a 19-kDa glycoprotein that downregulates the transport of major histocompatibility complex I molecules to the surface of an infected cell and reduces the inflammatory response generated against the vector (Ginsberg et al., 1989). Other E3 products block tumor necrosis factor-induced lysis or apoptosis of infected cells (see Wold, 1993; Tollefson, 1998). Because the E3 ORF can be deleted without affecting viability, a foreign gene can be substituted into this region and expressed under control of the E3 promoter.",

Late in infection, host cell protein synthesis is shut off due to inhibition of eIF-4E, a cellular translation initiation factor (Zhang et al., 1994). The presence of the TPL confers eIF-4E independence and ensures that the viral mRNAs are translated preferentially (Dolph et al., 1988, 1990).

A property of nondefective vectors that may be useful in some situations is their ability to shut off host cell macromolecular synthesis. This effectively enriches the expression of a recombinant protein regulated by late viral transcriptional and translational elements.",

As it is possible for cells to be infected simultaneously with two different adenoviruses, defective mutants can be grown by coinfection with a nondefective helper that trans complements the missing function. Pure stocks of defective vectors can also be propagated by growth in cell lines that provide the missing viral function(s). The first such cell line, 293, was constructed by the transformation of human embryonic kidney cells with sheared Ad5 DNA and contains an integrated copy of the E1 region (Graham et al., 1977). This allows growth of viral mutants in which the E1a region has been replaced by foreign sequences. Complementation by 293 cells is very efficient and allows growth of El-deleted adenoviruses to near wild-type levels. A subline of 293, which was adapted for growth in suspension culture, has been described (Graham, 1987). This should be of use in producing large quantities of recombinant protein in high-density cultures.",

These vectors are propagated by coinfection with a helper virus and have very high capacities to accept DNA inserts. In one example of this \u201cempty\u201d vector strategy, the Cre/Lox recombinase system was used to remove the packaging signals from the helper virus chromosome during vector growth, rendering it unpackageable (Parks et al., 1996). However, so far there are no such vectors that are truly helper independent, and it is currently impossible to remove all the helper virus from a preparation of vector. This may be a disadvantage, depending on the intended application of the vector. As helper viruses themselves are usually replication defective, their presence at low levels may not be an issue for in vitro experiments. It also appears that the minimum allowable size of DNA for efficient packaging is about 27 kb, as shorter chromosomes are not propagated stably (Parks and Graham, 1997).",

This leads to an antivector immune response and contributes to the short-term gene expression seen in most gene therapy experiments to date (Yang et al., 1994, 1995). This has prompted the development of vector systems deleted for additional viral genes such as E4 or the E2a DNA-binding protein, which are expected to be less immunogenic and safer in vivo (Wang et al., 1995; Brough et al., 1996; Yeh et al., 1996; Krougliak and Graham, 1995; Zhou et al., 1996; Brough et al., 1996; Gorziglia et al., 1996).

Generally, DNA isolated from virions is digested with a restriction enzyme that removes the left end of the chromosome, including the viral packaging signals. This renders the large DNA fragment noninfectious. The unique ClaI site located at 2.6 m.u. is commonly used for this purpose (Fig. 3A). Undigested viral DNA and the smaller DNA fragments are often removed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The large fragment is ligated in vitro to a DNA fragment containing the left end of the chromosome and containing the desired modifications (Stow, 1981). If the viral DNA contained in this fragment has a deletion of the E1a region, the resulting recombinant Ad will be a replication-defective E1 mutant. Inclusion of unique restriction sites in the left end-containing plasmid (generally in the place of the E1a gene) simplifies insertion of a cDNA. The ligation products are then transfected into host cells to regenerate infectious virus (Fig. 3A).",

An essentially complete but unpackageable viral genome is cloned into one plasmid, such as pJM17or pBHG10. A construct such as pJM17 is noninfectious due to the insertion of plasmid sequences into the viral region, rendering it too large to package into viral particles (McGrory et al., 1988). Deletion of the viral packaging sequences from plasmids such as pBHG10, as shown in Fig. 3C, prevents replication of the nonrecombinant plasmid (Bett et al., 1994). A second plasmid contains the left end of the viral chromosome, including an intact packaging sequence. The E1a region is generally deleted from this second plasmid (p\u0394E1Sp1A in Fig. 3C) and replaced by a linker with one or more unique restriction sites. The presence of unique cloning sites, and the smaller size of this second plasmid, greatly simplifies the process of inserting a gene of interest into the viral backbone. Another unique restriction site has been engineered into the E3 deletion of pBHG10, which allows insertion of foreign sequence here as well. After cloning of the desired sequences into either or both plasmids, they are cotransfected into a packaging cell line such as 293. Only after recombination takes place between the two plasmids will a packageable viral chromosome be generated.",

Most of the Ad genome is contained in the cosmid pAdex1, which has been modified to contain a unique restriction site for the insertion of a foreign sequence in place of the viral E1 region. Cosmid DNA is transfected into host cells along with an adenovirus DNA\u2013TP complex that has been digested by a restriction enzyme that cuts the viral backbone many times. Fragmentation of the viral backbone reduces background due to the carryover of donor virus or to religation of its fragments. Homologous recombination between the pAdex cosmid and the terminal fragments of the donor viral DNA regenerates a full-length chromosome that has a molecule of TP covalently attached at each end.

The majority of virions produced remain associated with the cell, allowing concentration by pelleting infected cells prior to spontaneous lysis. A simple freeze-thaw lysis of infected cells is then performed, followed by banding of virus on CsCl gradients (Graham and Prevec, 1995; Everitt et al., 1977). For some uses, such as infection of cells in vitro to produce a stock of recombinant protein, CsCl purification may be unnecessary. Purified virus is dialyzed into buffer containing 10% glycerol and is quite stable for long-term storage at \u221270 \u00b0C (Graham and Prevec, 1995). Storing the purified virus in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 0.9% NaCl, and 10% glycerol has been found to improve stability. Titers of a standard El-deleted adenovirus in excess of 1011 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml can be obtained readily by this method. Chromatographic methods for virus isolation have been developed that may further simplify production and scaleup (Huyghe et al., 1995).",

For a detailed study of several methods for Ad quantitation and of factors that affect results, see Mittereder et al. (1996). The number of virus particles in solution is often determined by absorbance at 280 nm or by a standard protein assay (1 \u03bcg of Ad2 proteins corresponds to 4 \u00d7 109 viral particles). An HPLC-based method for quantifying Ad particles has also been described (Shabram et al., 1997). However, measuring the virus particle number does not provide information about the biological activity of a preparation, and infectious titers are generally reported in PFU. Plaque assays are straightforward to carry out, but require from 10 to 14 days from start to finish, depending on the rate of growth of an individual virus. A more rapid assay is the measurement of fluorescent focus units (FFU) (Thiel and Smith, 1967). Results of the FFU assay are available 1 to 2 days after infection of cells. Because of their high level of synthesis, viral structural proteins are good targets for immunostaining of infected cells. The authors have used polyclonal antibodies raised against either penton base or fiber to measure FFU.",

HBsAg levels produced by infected A549 cells reached levels of almost 4 \u03bcg/106 cells in these experiments. Saito et al. (1985) also created a nondefective vector by inserting the HBsAg gene (this time driven by the HBV promoter) between E4 and the ITR of Ad5.

A genomic fragment of SIV containing the overlapping env and rev genes was inserted into the E3 region of Ad5 (Cheng et al., 1992), and proper splicing of the mRNA to produce both SIV proteins was observed. The presence of the rev gene upregulated env protein production in this context as well, indicating that a complex foreign transcript incorporated into an Ad vector can be spliced into two different functional mRNAs that produce appropriately interacting proteins.",

Biologically active interleukin (IL)-6 was expressed using a recombinant Ad that also contained the HBsAg gene (Lindley et al., 1994). A CMV-driven human IL-2 gene was inserted into the E1 region of an Ad5 vector, and expression was evaluated in several human cell lines (Addison et al., 1995). Secretion of IL-2 was measured at 25\u2013110 ng/106 cells over a period of several days. The recombinant protein was active, as measured by the ability to stimulate growth of an IL-2-dependent cell line. Smith and co-workers (1996) inserted the genes for secretable ciliary neurotrophic factor (sCNTF) or for neurotrophin-3 into replication-defective Ad and reported that both viruses allowed secretion of their respective proteins into the medium at concentrations sufficient to promote neuronal survival in vitro. Other growth factors that have been expressed using Ad vectors include fibroblast growth factor-4 (HST-1/FGF-4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Konishi et al., 1996; M\u00fchlhauser et al., 1995).",

Intraperitoneal administration of an Ad vector containing the gene encoding HST-1/FGF-4 to mice stimulated platelet production (Sakamoto et al., 1994).

An Ad recombinant was used to express human CD4 on the surface of a number of CD4-negative cell lines (Yasukawa et al., 1997).

This removes most E3 coding sequences but leaves the E3 promoter intact, which allows it to direct expression of the transgene. A number of studies using such substitutions have reported that transgene expression was largely E3 driven, even when the inserted DNA contained its own promoter sequences (Both et al., 1993; Schneider et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1988). Expression of genes inserted into the E3 region of a nondefective vector may also be affected by late viral promoters, probably the MLP, late in infection (Dewar et al., 1989; Morin et al., 1987).

Transcription of a reporter gene in infected cells could be induced by the addition of retinoids, both in culture and in vivo (Hayashi et al., 1994). The mouse metallothionine promoter also retained its zinc-inducible expression in an Ad context (Yajima et al., 1996). Varley et al.

Cells infected with either virus were found to express high levels of luciferase in response to the cytokines present in conditioned culture medium. In vivo studies demonstrated that luciferase expression was upregulated in tissues of mice infected with these vectors and challenged with inflammatory agents such as lipopolysaccharide toxins or turpentine (Varley et al., 1995).",

Some cell types (most notably many hematopoietic cells) are difficult to infect using Ad. This is largely due to these cells lacking expression of either the CAR protein, which serves as the fiber receptor (Bergelson et al., 1997; Tomko et al., 1997), or integrins appropriate for the internalization of virus (Wickham et al., 1993). For example, in human airway organ culture, regenerating cells were found to be much more infectible than normal cells (Dupuit et al., 1995). Another study showed that immature cells in the airway were much more susceptible to infection by Ad and that these cells expressed higher levels of the integrins needed for virus internalization (Goldman and Wilson, 1995). In skeletal muscle, the infectibility of different cell populations has also been shown to correlate with \u03b1v integrin expression (Acsadi et al., 1994). Huang and colleagues have demonstrated that lymphoid cells can be infected efficiently if they are treated with growth factors that upregulate the synthesis of \u03b1v integrins (Huang et al., 1995) and that there is an alternate pathway of infection using \u03b1m integrins in at least some lymphoid cell types (Huang et al., 1996).",
