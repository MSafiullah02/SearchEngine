            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory/neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which both genetic and environmental factors cooperate in the chronic activation of immune cells to produce oligodendrocyte and neuron damage. Epidemiological studies have identified several environmental risk factors in MS, such as exposure to certain viruses and smoking or even lack of exposure to sunlight with a subsequent reduced vitamin D production. These factors are associated with the susceptibility in developing MS but they could also influence the disease course. However, no single risk factor per se appears to be responsible for the development of the disease, but a multifactorial interplay is most likely. Because of this complex interplay, it is quite difficult to define the real impact of each single factor and in this respect the only way to proceed is to design large enough studies with high-quality data.1., 2. However, what is certainly even less known is the way in which these external factors are able to induce and sustain the internal pathology process of the disease. In this chapter we try to provide an overview of the most relevant environmental factors and how they may affect the immune response in MS.",

            "text": "Though the etiology of MS remains as yet unknown,3 its pathogenesis has been quite extensively investigated and mostly clarified since it is widely accepted that activated peripheral immune cells enter the CNS to produce the pathology.4 The initial dysfunction can also occur within the CNS and it can include mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons or oligodendrocytes, axonal energy insufficiency, or even damage to other neural organelles such as peroxisomes.5 In such a case, whichever the initial injury, the leakage of CNS antigens into draining lymph nodes activates T cells that address and enter the CNS, inducing inflammation, demyelination, and oligodendrocyte loss as well as axonal/neuronal injury and loss. Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells are needed to activate T cells. The APCs, either from the periphery or from the CNS, migrate to lymph nodes, carrying the antigen (a short segment of the pathogen) bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC class I for CD8+ and II for CD4+ commitment) on their cell surface. In the lymph nodes, the antigen is presented to na\u00efve T cells through a T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing the antigen/MHC combination. This trimolecular complex (MHC/antigen/TCR) constitutes a first signal, but a second signal, mediated by costimulatory molecules (eg, B7 on APCs and CD28 on T cells) is needed for full activation of the T cells, their proliferation, and subsequent differentiation into effector cells. CD4+ T cells are crucial in MS as they can differentiate into proinflammatory T helper (Th) 1 or 17 subsets, antiinflammatory Th2 cells, or into cells with regulatory/antiinflammatory properties (Tregs), depending on the microenvironment and cytokine milieu.6 In MS patients there is a tendency to generate either Th1 or Th17 subsets, which in addition to being proinflammatory7 may have neurotoxic effects,8 whereas the regulatory/antiinflammatory Th2 and Tregs subsets are reported to be deficient in MS.9\n",

They then cross the endothelial cell barrier by means of the proteolytic activity of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), first migrating across the endothelial basement membrane and then the parenchymal basement membrane or glia limitans, and finally they enter the CNS parenchyma. As a matter of fact MMPs have been reported to be upregulated in MS.16 Upon entering the CNS parenchyma, T cells are reactivated through repeated antigen presentation by APCs such as microglia, macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells. Activated immune cell subsets, as well as inflammation and demyelination, also induce neuronal injury and loss by producing free radicals, glutamate, and other excitotoxins, proteases, and cytokines.8., 17.\n",

            "text": "DNA methylation23 consists of the addition of a methyl group to the carbon-5 of a cytosine residue in DNA through the intervention of enzymes called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication and localizes to the DNA replication fork, where it methylates nascent DNA strands at the same locations as in the template strand.24 DNMT3a and DNMT3b intervene in the de novo methylation of unmethylated and hemimethylated sites in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, respectively.24., 25. Especially in mammals, DNA methylation usually occurs at CpG sites (where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide) that can be found with up to several hundred dinucleotide repeats, therefore called CpG islands and mostly found in gene promoter regions. The methylation or hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions has been reported to block the expression of the associated gene.26 DNA methylation is the best investigated physiological epigenetic mechanism so far.27\n",

            "text": "Mainly in mammalian cells, histone proteins interact with DNA to form chromatin, the packaged form of DNA. Histones are octamers consisting of two copies of each of the four histone proteins: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Each histone octamer has 146 bp of the DNA strand wrapped around it to shape one nucleosome, the basic unit of the chromatin. Histone proteins can be modified23 by posttranslational changes such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and citrullination. Since these histone modifications produce changes to the structure of chromatin they may affect the accessibility of the DNA strand to transcriptional enzymes, therefore inducing either activation or repression of genes associated with the modified histone.28 Acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, is currently the most investigated and hence the most clarified histone modification. Acetylation of histones generally results in the upregulation of transcriptional activity of the associated gene, whereas deacetylation of histones contributes to transcriptional silencing.29\n",

If both pools differentiate into Th1 or Th17 proinflammatory subsets, these can become reactivated within the CNS to promote pathology. In fact, T-cell lines isolated from MS patients demonstrate cross-reactivity between MBP and coronavirus58 or Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)59 antigens. Furthermore, a significant degree of crystal structural similarity has been shown between the DRB5\u22170101-EBV peptide complex and the DRB1\u22171501-MBP peptide complex at the cell surface for TCR recognition.60 Further immunological evidence in the association of EBV with MS has been provided. The follicular-like structures under the meninges include B cells that are infected with EBV in many patients.61 MS patients have antibodies that cross-react between MBP and EBV, a possible additional mechanism by which anti-EBV antibodies may disrupt myelin.62 Furthermore, EBV-reactive CD8+ T cells that are restricted by HLA-B7, a common allele in MS, are dysregulated in MS63 and the CD8+ T-cell deficiency in MS impairs the capacity to control EBV infection with the result that EBV-infected B cells accumulate in the CNS where they produce pathogenic autoantibodies and provide survival signals to autoreactive T cells.64\n",

Patients with a clinically isolated syndrome have an increased risk of conversion to clinically definite MS in smokers compared to nonsmokers.67 MS smokers have more gadolinium-enhancing lesions, a greater T2-lesion load, and more brain atrophy than nonsmokers,68 as well as a quicker increase in T2-lesion volume and brain atrophy in an average follow-up period of time.69 As far as the disease progression is concerned, the data are quite discordant since smoking is in some cases reported not to be associated with the risk of SP or with that of reaching Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 4.0 or 6.070; in others it is reported to be associated with a greater risk of SP course69., 71. or even with an increase in EDSS scores during two years of follow-up.72 In conclusion, smoking may have more influence in the early disease course than in the late disease stages of MS.",

As far as MS is concerned, the potential relevance of vitamin D-induced histone modification is suggested by a study showing that binding of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to the vitamin D receptor leads to suppression of transcription of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17, via recruitment of histone deacetylase 2 to the IL17A promoter region.102\n",

Nevertheless, it remains unclear how and when these agents may become detrimental. Since the microbiota has an impact on the host\u2019s immune system,105 it is likely to shift the balance between protective and pathogenic immune responses.
