            "text": "Acute bronchiolitis (AB) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in nursing infants, and of hospital admission in infants under one year of age. 1, 2 The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent causal microorganism, though many others can also cause the disorder, with different degrees of severity. 3---5 Acute bronchiolitis is characterized as the first episode of breathing difficulty in nursing infants under 24 months of age, preceded by an upper airway infection, and commonly occurring in an epidemic period. 6 Consensus is lacking regarding the clinical definition of acute bronchiolitis in children. 7, 8 Studies on the admission rates attributable to the disorder are scarce, though it has been reported that 2---3% of all patients with acute bronchiolitis require hospital admission, and of these, 3---11% require admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) ---though this figure reaches 50% in populations with associated risk factors. 9, 10 Few therapeutic measures of established efficacy in application to acute bronchiolitis are available. Many studies have described great variability in patient management. 11, 12 Treatment is merely supportive, and the adoption of a conservative management approach seems adequate in most children, particularly in the youngest patients. The fact that most cases evolve favorably over time, independently of the chosen treatment option, probably explains why we still use certain drugs with no demonstrated clinical benefits, based on professional or institutional preferences. 13---17 Bronchiolitis generates an important problem, since most drug treatments have been shown to be of little help, and the current guides recommend that drug treatment be restricted in most cases. As a result, there is widespread variability in reference to both over-and under-treatment. Evaluation of adherence to the international recommendations is very important. In this respect, bronchiolitis constitutes a challenge for the general management of each patient, specific treatment, and ventilatory support.",

The increase in adrenaline use during the second time period cannot be attributed to increased patient severity, since the scores of the different scales did not differ significantly, though there was a tendency toward increased NIV use and a lesser application of invasive mechanical ventilation (albeit without statistically significant differences). One of our hypotheses is that more adrenaline was used due to the increased use of NIV (since inhaled adrenaline is not employed in intubated patients), though it cannot be discarded that administration of this drug rescues more patients that avoid the need for intubation. More extensive studies are needed in order to confirm this.",

Nevertheless, the observed rate is similar to that reported in other studies conducted in the PICU setting. 13, 33 A recent study by Shein et al. justifies antibiotic treatment in the first two days of intubation among patients with severe bronchiolitis, on the grounds that it reduces the mean duration of stay. 34 In our study, on comparing the two time periods, we observed a clear decrease in the indication of antibiotic treatment, together with a reduction in the duration of such treatment. This was probably due not only to the change in bronchiolitis management protocol in line with the recommendations of the AAP, but also to implementation of the antibiotic treatment optimization program in the PICU in the course of the second half of the year 2014. The adoption of these programs seeks to improve the clinical outcomes and ensure minimum toxicity, with a decrease in the development of resistances. 35 In the case of severe bronchiolitis, the high antibiotic treatment rates observed both in our study and in the literature in general probably require the adoption of strategies for the early suspension of such treatment, as well as de-escalation measures. Accordingly, there is a clear need for diagnostic tools referred to invasive bacterial infection, since the signs and symptoms are very unspecific and difficult to distinguish from those of the viral condition. 36 The use of biomarkers such as procalcitonin could help discriminate between the systemic inflammatory response generated by the viral infection and bacterial overinfection ---thus allowing individualization of the indication and duration of antibiotic treatment. 37 In our series, the patients in the second period that received antibiotic treatment during fewer days did not experience clinical worsening and did not require longer PICU stays; early de-escalation therefore seems to be a safe practice.",
