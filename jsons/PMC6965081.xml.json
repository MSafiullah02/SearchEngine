Inactivated influenza vaccines without adjuvant are poorly immunogenic in young children2, who are at high risk for influenza-associated complications3\u20135. To improve the efficacy, a two-dose schedule (separated by a >4-week interval) is currently recommended for children younger than 9 years in the United States6,7. Nevertheless, the need for the second dose is cumbersome for parents8,9. Moreover, even after two-dose vaccination, the proportion of young children with a \u22651:40 hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titer reaches only 70% for A/H1N1, 60% for A/H3N2, and <40% for B for children who are seronegative at baseline2.

MF59 is an optimized oil-in-water formulation using biodegradable squalene and two nontoxic nonionic surfactants, Tween 80 and Span 8521. MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines were first licensed for the elderly in 199721.

To identify the source of heterogeneity, we performed meta-regression, which showed that this high between-trial heterogeneity was nearly all explained by the large variations in seroprotection rate in the non-adjuvanted arm (ranging from 4 to 100% across the trials). A high seroprotection rate in non-adjuvanted vaccines (probably the result of a high proportion of participants with a priming effect from previous exposure to natural influenza infections or influenza vaccination) poses a constraint on the numerical value of seroprotection RR. For example, with a 100% rate in the non-adjuvanted arm, the maximal possible RR between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups would be only 1.0 (100% versus 100%). However, with a 4% rate in the non-adjuvanted arm, the maximal possible numerical value of RR would increase to 25 (100% versus 4%). By focusing on the trials with participants who were influenza vaccine naive and showing a poor serological response to non-adjuvanted vaccines, our meta-analysis was able to show that oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines consistently had a significantly superior efficacy and a significantly superior seroprotection rate, especially for A/H1N1 and A/H3N2.",

Because flu-like symptoms in young children may be caused by other virus such as respiratory syncytial virus, an age-based approach would be desirable. The all-naive group (Fig. 2) and the poor response group (Figs. 3,  5, and  7), for whom adjuvanted vaccines are significantly superior to the non-adjuvanted counterparts, are mostly comprised of young children aged <3 years, while the non-naive group and the moderate/good response groups (for whom adjuvant and non-adjuvanted vaccines are similar) included many children aged 3 years or more. Therefore, oil-in-water-adjuvanted influenza vaccine may be most appropriate for the first seasonal influenza vaccination for young children <3 years old. On the other hand, for older children or children who had prior influenza vaccination, there might be no advantage to using oil-in-water-adjuvanted influenza vaccines to replace less expensive non-adjuvanted vaccines for annual influenza vaccination.",

The CHMP criteria were based on correlations between HI titer and infection rate observed in challenge studies conducted in healthy adults using attenuated influenza virus43. For seasonal influenza vaccines, a >2.5-fold increase in the geometric mean titer, a >40% seroconversion rate/significant increase, or a >70% seroprotection rate was required for licensing43. The applicability of these criteria to young children has not been established43. Based on these criteria and given their recognized limitations, our meta-analysis showed that a single-dose oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccine might suffice for providing protection against A/H1N1 (pooled data for seroprotection rate: 88.7%) and A/H3N2 (pooled data for seroprotection rate: 87.7%). However, to provide protection against B, the second dose would be necessary because the seroprotection rate reached only 36.2% after the first dose.",

Narcolepsy incidences following other adjuvanted H1N1pdm09-monovalent vaccines were also investigated in Canada (where a different AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, ArepanrixTM from GlaxoSmithKline, was used)51,52, South Korea (where MF59-adjuvanted vaccine Greenflu-S plusTM was used; the MF59 was from Novartis)53, and Taiwan (where MF59-adjuvanted vaccine FocetriaTM from Novartis was used)54. Most of these investigations did not find an increase in narcolepsy incidence, except for that in Quebec, Canada, where a possible small increase (one per million vaccine doses) was reported (although \u201ca confounding effect of influenza infection cannot be ruled out\u201d52). In Taiwan, a three-fold increase in narcolepsy incidence occurred before the start of H1N1 vaccination, and influenza-like illness during 2009 H1N1 pandemic period was a strong risk factor (case\u2013control matched odds ratio: 2.72; P = 0.0137, by conditional logistic regression) for the onset of narcolepsy in children54. In China (where no adjuvanted H1N1pdm09-monovalent vaccines were used), narcolepsy incidence increased by 3-fold following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, but the majority (>90%) of Chinese narcolepsy cases had no influenza vaccination history55. Antibodies to nucleoproteins of inactivated influenza virus in PandemrixTM, which cross-react with human hypocretin receptor 2, may trigger the immune-mediated pathogenesis of narcolepsy56. The other two AS03- or MF59-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines, ArepanrixTM and FocetriaTM, contain a much lower amount of viral nucleoproteins than that in Pandemrix56,57, and were not associated with a detectable increase in risk of narcolepsy48\u201350,56\u201359. However, it remains unknown whether removal of viral nucleoprotein from adjuvanted influenza vaccines, through a better purification process during manufacturing, would eliminate the risk of narcolepsy.",
