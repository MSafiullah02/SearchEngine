The RVP assay comprises a multiplex real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by a multiplex target\u2010specific primer extension step 16, 17.

In addition to the RVP assay, all BAL specimens from HSCT recipients with suspected pneumonia are evaluated by the following microbiologic studies: bacterial Gram stain and culture, fungal Calcofluor potassium hydroxide stain and culture, acid\u2010fast bacillus stain and culture, Legionella culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii direct fluorescent\u2010antibody testing, and respiratory virus culture including cytomegalovirus, influenza, PIV, RSV, and adenovirus.",

Notably, in multivariate analyses, the presence of 1 or more additional respiratory pathogens remained independently associated with pneumonia. Furthermore, among all 25 episodes of proven HRV pneumonia, 60% demonstrated bacterial, fungal, or viral co\u2010infection. These findings are consistent with previous reports of HSCT recipients with pneumonia and HRV detection in BAL fluid that have also identified bacterial or fungal co\u2010infection in the majority of cases 15, 20. Among immunocompetent adults and children, HRVs have been detected in up to 17% of episodes of community\u2010acquired pneumonia using PCR 21, 22, often with concomitant bacterial infection. Several potential mechanisms through which HRV increases susceptibility to bacterial infection have been demonstrated in vitro. For example, HRVs stimulate Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion to human tracheal epithelial cells via increases in platelet\u2010activating factor\u2010receptors 23, promote S. aureus internalization into non\u2010fully permissive cultured pneumocytes 24, and disrupt epithelial cell barrier function by dissociation of zona\u2010occludens 1 from the tight junction complex, thereby facilitating transmigration of bacteria 25. Therefore, HRVs may be similar to influenza in predisposing to bacterial superinfection. Other mechanisms by which influenza increases susceptibility to bacterial infection, including airway epithelial damage, surface receptor changes, and altered neutrophil function, warrant further study in models of HRV infection.",

This is notable because all patients were tested for a panel of 10 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR during each HRV infection, and therefore, the likelihood of missed cases of viral co\u2010infection was low. Our findings are consistent with those of Greer et al. 26, who showed a statistically significant reduction in viral co\u2010detection compared with other respiratory viruses, perhaps because of mediation of interferon\u2010stimulating genes, thus inducing a protective antiviral state.",

For example, in patients with asthma, impaired innate and adaptive immune responses, including deficient interferon production 29, 33 and augmented T\u2010helper (Th)2 or impaired Th1 or Interleukin\u201010 immunity 27, have been implicated in increased bronchial inflammation and hyperreactivity.

These findings included a striking necrotizing bronchitis including ciliocytophthoria of bronchial epithelial cells 34 and an effaced nuclear chromatin amidst bronchial epithelial cells, although without unequivocal intranuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions. Similar nuclear changes were not seen within the alveolar pneumocytes. In the few reported cases of HRV LRTI with human histology, HRV is capable of causing both interstitial and alveolar processes. In these reports, pathologic findings included bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia 14, interstitial pneumonitis 20, acute and chronic inflammation with fibrinopurulent alveolar debris 35, and hyperplasia and desquamation of alveolar cells 36.

First, as our data are observational and rely on clinical specimens, some patients with HRV\u2010associated acute respiratory illness may have been missed if they were not tested for HRV. Missed cases of HRV\u2010associated acute respiratory illness would be more likely to occur with mild URI than pneumonia, because most HSCT recipients with pneumonia are hospitalized and undergo thorough microbiologic evaluation. Therefore, we cannot infer the relative frequency with which HRV causes pneumonia compared to URI in the HSCT population. Concern may be raised that HRV detection in the lower airways reflects colonization rather than infection. However, the same argument could be made for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A, PIV3 and RSV, which are known to cause both URI and LRTI. Several studies have demonstrated HRV replication in primary human airway epithelial cells 37, 38. Moreover, the ability of HRVs to replicate in bronchial epithelium after experimental upper airway infection of healthy human volunteers has been demonstrated using in situ hybridization 2. Another limitation is that molecular testing was not routinely performed for certain viral (coronavirus, PIV4, and human bocavirus) and atypical pathogens (Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia) during the study period, potentially missing additional cases of HRV co\u2010infection.",

This conclusion is also consistent with 2 recent studies in which 100% of clinical specimens (n = 164) positive for HRV/HEV by RVP were subsequently confirmed positive for HRV and negative for HEV upon further molecular testing 39, 40.",

Knowledge that certain strains and species of HRV are associated with severe respiratory infection in patients with hematologic malignancy may aid in risk stratification of patients with HRV URI before transplantation and improve infection control practices in hospitalized patients.
