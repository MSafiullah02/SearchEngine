Since the transmission of H5N1 avian influenza from birds to humans in 1997, virologists and public health officials alike anticipated global human spread of this virus. More recently, however, pandemic spread of a novel H1N1 influenza virus arose from an unpredicted source; precursors of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus have been circulating among pigs for over a decade [1, 2]. Additional reassortment events have led to the current pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus. Features observed in past pandemics, including atypical seasonality and shifting of the burden of disease to younger populations, are evident during the influenza pandemic of 2009.",

Recent events in influenza virus research have contributed to this progress [3]. These include the development of plasmid-based reverse genetics systems [4, 5], the generation of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [6], improved access to biosafety level 3 facilities, the establishment of international influenza virus sequence databases, and bioinformatics [7, 8]. Advances have also led to the production of FDA-approved antivirals for influenza, and a heightened understanding of host\u2013virus interactions resulted in the exploration of novel therapies including immunodulatory approaches [9]. New vaccine technologies such as the use of live-attenuated vaccines [10\u201313] and the development of novel vaccine production methods, including cell culture-based approaches, are the benefits of scientific progress. Continued acceleration of influenza virus research has direct implications for the development of improved vaccines, infection control, and clinical management during pandemic and interpandemic periods.",

These types differ in various aspects, the most important of which include antigenicity, host range, pathogenicity, transmission, and seasonality. Standard nomenclature for human influenza viruses includes type, geographic location of isolation, isolate number, and year of isolation. For example, an influenza A virus isolated in Panama in 1999 would be referred to as A/Panama/2002/1999. Subtypes of influenza A viruses are described by hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) designations. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been described.",

Clinical disease includes systemic and respiratory manifestations, and rarely may be complicated by central nervous system involvement, toxic shock, or multiorgan system failure [14, 15]. Circulating strains of influenza A viruses are targets for annual vaccination to mitigate morbidity and mortality imparted by these viruses. In addition to infecting humans, influenza A viruses circulate in other mammals, including swine and horses. Waterfowl harbor several lineages of influenza A viruses and serve as a reservoir. Transmission among wild and domestic fowl and mammalian species is an important characteristic of influenza A, enabling viral reassortment and emergence of novel subtypes in susceptible human populations.",

Re-emergence of the Victoria lineage after a decade of absence was associated with an outbreak during the 2001\u20132002 influenza season, affecting healthy but immunologically naive children [20].

            "text": "In humans, influenza viruses are transmitted by the respiratory route. Host cellular receptors consist of oligosaccharides residing on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells. Specificity of binding is imparted by the linkage of the penultimate galactose (Gal) to N-acetylsialic acid (SA). \u03b12,6 linkage (SA\u03b12,6Gal) is distributed in the human respiratory tract and is associated with binding to human influenza virus HA. In contrast, avian hosts including waterfowl and domestic poultry harbor sialic acid with \u03b12,3 linkage (SA\u03b12,3Gal) which is distributed in the gastrointestinal tract, reflecting the fecal-oral mode of transmission of avian influenza strains in these species [23]. Specificity of viral HA binding is imparted by the receptor-binding pocket on the surface of the HA molecule (Fig.2). The HA is a rod-shaped trimer anchored in the virion\u2019s envelope and contains three primary ligand-binding sites on a globular head [24, 25]. Specificity of binding has been linked to certain amino acid residues in the HA receptor-binding domain. In H3 subtypes, amino acid 226 is one such residue, where the presence of leucine allows binding of SA\u03b12,6Gal, whereas the presence of glutamine at this position permits binding of SA\u03b12,3Gal. Amino acid changes in the HA of other subtypes, such as H1 viruses (including the H1N1 virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic), have been associated with adaptations in receptor-binding specificity, translating into a switch in host specificity with disastrous consequences [26, 27]. Specifically, changes at amino acid position 225 impart the ability of A/New York/1/18 to bind both avian and human host influenza virus receptors [26]. Strains of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses retain amino acids (aspartic acids) at positions 190 and 225 of the HA consistent with human sialic acid receptor-binding specificity, although conflicting data exist regarding binding specificity for these viruses. One approach utilizing carbohydrate microarrays suggests that dual (human and avian) sialic acid receptor binding occurs [28]; data obtained using a different approach, namely biotinylated \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-sialylated glycans, suggest currently circulating pandemic viruses preferentially bind human sialic acid receptors with \u03b12-6 linkage [29]. The importance of these amino acid residues to respiratory droplet transmission has recently been described using the ferret transmission model. H1N1 viruses containing aspartic acids at residues 190 and 225 were capable of aerosol transmission. This contrasted with H1N1 viruses with glutamic acid and glycine at residues 190 and 225, respectively (consistent with avian sialic acid receptor-binding specificity), which did not transmit through the air [30]. Furthermore, other changes in the HA (and NA) of an avian H9N2 after adaptation in the ferret conferred a more efficient respiratory transmission phenotype [31].\n",

Endocytosis is a multistep process consisting of surface receptor-mediated binding, internalization, and intracellular trafficking. Clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent internalization via caveolae and caveolae-independent endocytosis have been demonstrated [33, 34]. An initial acidification step in early endosomes is followed by trafficking to low-pH late endosomes, a process mediated by members of the Rab host protein family. Fusion of influenza virus to the endosome is triggered by low pH conditions and mediated by the fusion peptide of HA2 after cleavage of HA, creating a pore in the endosome through fusion of viral and endosomal membranes (Fig.3) [3].\n",

RNA segments are coated by NP through nonspecific interactions between the arginine-rich positively charged NP and the negatively charged RNA phosphate backbone [3]. The viral polymerase complex consists of tightly associated PB1, PB2, and PA and associates with NP-coated RNA without disrupting this interaction [39]. PB1 is an endonuclease involved in both replication and transcription and binds the promoter region of RNA segments [40]. It functions as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and catalyzes RNA chain elongation. Interaction with PA is required for this function and viral replication [41]. PB2 binds both NP and PB1 via separate binding sites [42]. Initiation of transcription is reliant on PB2, which binds the cap on host pre-mRNA, and this cap serves as a primer for transcription [43, 44]. In addition, interactions between PB2 and host proteins may be species specific and potentially plays a role in restricting host range [45]. PA is a component of the polymerase heterotrimer, is cotransported into the nucleus with PB1, and is thus important in the formation of this complex [46, 47].",

The NA functions as a sialidase and cleaves sialic acids from the host cell and viral glycoproteins to minimize viral aggregation at the cell surface [71]. Balance between the HA and NA is thus required for optimal receptor binding and destruction [64, 72].

Influenza A viruses exhibit an evolutionary pattern, which is complex and consists of antigenic drift and shift. Drift occurs on an annual basis and has been attributed to low fidelity of the RNA polymerase and subsequent selection from immune pressure exerted by the host [74]. This results in antigenic diversity of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins and is one of the major challenges to vaccine production, requiring annual changes to vaccine components. The HA1 domain contains several epitopes and is the most dynamic as a consequence, demonstrating clusters of antigenic variance over time [75]. Antigenic shift results after a viral reassortment event where exchange of one or more of the viral segments with that of another strain may result in a novel serotype, potentially diversifying the host range of the virus. It is in this setting that pandemic strains have emerged in immunologically na\u00efve populations in the past, including the H2N2 (with new HA, NA, and PB1 segment) subtype in 1957 and the H3N2 influenza virus (with new HA and PB1 segments) which caused a pandemic in 1968 (Fig.4).\n",

Lack of transmission among humans remains a barrier to pandemic spread of these viruses. The H5N1 subtype isolated from avian species has undergone genetic reassortment, and several genotypes exist. Genotypes Z and V are largely responsible for outbreaks of highly pathogenic influenza viruses (HPAI) in domestic birds in Southeast Asia beginning in 2003 [77]. H5N1 viruses may also be divided into clades based on the genomic analysis of the HA genes, and clade 2 is further divided into subclades; up to ten clades have been identified in avian species, four of which have infected humans [79, 80]. Less than 1% divergence from avian isolates has been reported in viruses isolated from humans in Asia [7].",

The presence of several cocirculating clades in the human population has been described, accounting for reassortment. This can result in limited vaccine effectiveness, as seen with A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus during the 2003\u20132004 season [8]. Genetic evolution appears to be a relatively gradual process; however, antigenic changes in the HA1 domain tend to cluster [75]. Ongoing changes of the H3 hemagglutinin in the human population result from selective pressure exerted by the host immune system. In contrast, the H3 lineage in birds has remained relatively stable [82]. The rate of change of the H3 subtype is greater when compared with H1 viruses and influenza B, with estimated nucleotide changes per site per year of 0.0037 for H3, 0.0018 for H1, and 0.0013 for influenza B [83]. As greater numbers of influenza virus genome sequences become available and we gain insight into antigenic patterns of change, this knowledge may be applied to annual vaccine development. Prediction of future influenza sequences could lead to more timely development of effective vaccines [84] though modeling methods have yet to be validated.",

Although chicken and duck influenza viruses preferentially bind \u03b12,3Gal-linked SA, viruses from chickens had greater affinity for SA where the third sugar moiety was a \u03b2(1-4)GlcNAc-containing synthetic sialylglycopolymer. Duck viruses preferred \u03b2(1-3)GalNAc sugar moieties in the third position [104]. Distribution of influenza virus receptors reflects the sites of replication. In chickens and waterfowl, SA with \u03b12,3Gal linkage is found in the upper respiratory tract and intestines. Some species demonstrate the ability to support replication of both human and avian influenza viruses. The respiratory tract and intestines of quail contain both \u03b12,3Gal- and \u03b12,6Gal-linked terminal sialic acids [105]. In swine, oligosaccharides with both types of linkages may be found and suggest this species serves as a mixing vessel where human, avian, and swine influenza viruses can reassort [106, 107].",

            "text": "Few human histopathological studies of uncomplicated influenza exist. Pathological findings from postmortem examination of 47 fatal pediatric influenza A cases included major airway congestion (90%), inflammation (73%), and necrosis (50%) [112]. Lower airway pathology included hyaline membranes (67%), interstitial cellular infiltrates (67%), and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Secondary pneumonia, intraalveolar hemorrhage, and viral pneumonitis were noted in a quarter of cases [112]. Fulminant DAD with acute alveolar hemorrhage and necrosis followed by paucicellular fibrosis and hyaline membrane formation is observed in H5N1-infected human lungs [124]. Extrapulmonary pathology includes reactive hemophagocytosis in the hilar lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, and spleen [125]; white matter demyelination [124] and cerebral necrosis [101]; and acute tubular necrosis of the kidneys [113]. Despite the presence of diarrhea and H5N1 virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, no pathological lesions have been described in the bowel [101, 114]. Immune dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS and reactive hemophagocytosis. Elevated levels of neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage chemoattractants (IL-8, IP-10, MIG, and MCP-1) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3) are observed in H5N1-infected humans [95]. In addition, increased levels of IL-2 (in a human case) [113] and RANTES (in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells) [126] have also been reported. Contribution of proinflammatory mediators to lung pathology has also been demonstrated using Toll-like receptor 3 knockout mice infected with mouse-adapted WSN influenza A virus. These mice demonstrated enhanced survival despite higher virus replication and lower levels of RANTES, IL-6, and IL-12p40/p70 compared with wild-type mice [127].",

A single-gene reassortant containing the PB2 from A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1, which is fatal in mice) in the background of A/Hong Kong/486/97 (H5N1, causing mild respiratory infection in mice) demonstrated a lethal phenotype in this animal model [133]. In addition, reassortants containing polymerase complex genes from A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1), a nonlethal virus, in the background of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus isolated from a fatal human case were attenuated in an animal model [134]. When a single point mutation K627E in the PB2 gene was generated in A/Vietnam/1203/04 [134] and in A/Hong Kong/483/97 [133], virulence was reduced in mice, although in other studies this substitution did not reduce virulence substantially [135]. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for virulence have yet to be completely elucidated. Enhanced replication of viruses retaining a lysine at position 627 in PB2 at the lower temperatures of the upper respiratory tract (33\u00b0C) [136] may be responsible for robust transmission in mammals [137]. This theory is supported by recent work demonstrating that replacement of the lysine at position 627 with glutamic acid (avian consensus sequence) abrogates aerosol transmission of a 1918 influenza A virus [30]. Currently circulating strains of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus have a glutamine in PB2 at position 627. This may account for reduced efficiency of aerosol transmission of this virus in ferrets, compared with a seasonal H1N1 virus [29].",

Enhanced cleavage of the HA by ubiquitous host proteases is made possible by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site, contributing to the virulence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [146, 147]. Replacement of the polybasic cleavage site in a high pathogenicity H5N1 virus from Hong Kong (HK483) with an amino acid sequence typical of low pathogenicity viruses resulted in attenuation [133].

It is widely accepted that influenza virus is transmitted by the respiratory route in humans, though the contribution of small particle aerosols relative to large respiratory droplets is unknown. In addition, the role of fomites is questionable. Until recently, ferrets have served as the only animal model for the study of influenza virus transmission. A novel mammalian model using the guinea pig has recently been developed to overcome the limitations of the ferret model. Guinea pigs are highly susceptible to infection with an unadapted human H3N3 (A/Panama/2002/1999, or Pan99) influenza virus, with a 50% infectious dose of 5 PFU, and this virus grows to high titers in the upper respiratory tract and to moderate titers in the lungs. Transmission of Pan99 by direct contact and aerosol in this system is 100% (Fig.6) [153]; however, transmission efficiency may vary among influenza virus subtypes [154]. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity also appear to play a substantial role [155, 156]. Control of influenza virus spread during interpandemic and pandemic periods through vaccination [157] and physical means will be paramount to abrogating person-to-person transmission and is crucial where viruses are resistant to currently available antivirals.\n",
