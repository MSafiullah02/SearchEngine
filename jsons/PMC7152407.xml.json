In addition, certain habits such as cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse are also quite common in those with severe CAP, and cigarette smoking has been identified as a risk factor for bacteremic pneumococcal infection.15 Other common illnesses in those with CAP include malignancy and neurologic illness (including seizures). Milder forms of pneumonia may be more severe on presentation if patients have not received antibiotic therapy prior to hospital admission. In addition, genetic differences in the immune response may predispose certain individuals to more severe forms of infection and adverse outcomes and may be reflected by a family history of severe pneumonia or adverse outcomes from infection.16\nBox 43-1Risk Factors for Developing Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia\nAdvanced age (older than 65)Comorbid illnessChronic respiratory illness (including COPD), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, neurologic illness, renal insufficiency, malignancyCigarette smoking (risk for pneumococcal bacteremia)Alcohol abuseAbsence of antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalizationFailure to contain infection to its initial site of entryImmune suppressionGenetic polymorphisms in the immune response\n",

This tool is good for predicting mortality, but it heavily weights age and comorbidity and does not account for the social needs of patients, so it may not help to define the optimal site of care for a given patient. The CURB-65 approach assesses the presence of confusion, elevated BUN, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, low blood pressure (either systolic <90 mm Hg or diastolic <60 mm Hg), and whether the patient is at least 65 years old. If 3 of these 5 criteria are present, the predicted mortality rate is greater than 20%.22, 23\n",

            "text": "Prognostic scoring systems have been used to define the need for ICU admission, with the suggestion that ICU care be considered for those in PSI classes IV and V or those with a CURB-65 score of 3 or higher.8, 23 This may not always be effective because up to 37% of those admitted to the ICU are in PSI classes I to III, and risk for death (which PSI can measure) is not always the same as need for intensive care.8 Conversely, patients in higher PSI classes do not always need ICU care if they fall into these high-mortality-risk groups because of advanced age and comorbid illness, in the absence of physiologic findings of severe pneumonia. Neither of the current prognostic scoring systems is ideal by itself for defining the need for ICU care, and both can be regarded only as providing decision support information that must be supplemented by clinical assessment and judgment. In addition, the two scoring approaches should be viewed as being complementary to one another.24 For example, in one recent study that compared the PSI with the CURB-65, both were good for predicting mortality and in identifying low-mortality-risk patients. However, the CURB-65 appeared to be more discriminating in defining mortality risk in the severely ill.23 In another study, Ewig and colleagues25 examined the 10 criteria in the 1993 American Thoracic Society guidelines to define severe CAP. They found that need for ICU was defined by the presence of two of three minor criteria (systolic BP <90, multilobar disease, Pao\n2/FIO2 ratio <250) or one of two major criteria (need for mechanical ventilation or septic shock).25 On the basis of these observations, the 2001 ATS guidelines for CAP recommend that severe CAP could be defined on the basis of the presence of these features.1\n",

This leads to delays in initiating timely therapy and further increases the risk of dying.20 Older patients from nursing homes who present with pneumonia are now included in a separate category, HCAP (discussed earlier).",

These data, as well as information from Fagon and colleagues43 and Trouillet and colleagues,44 emphasize the important role of prior antibiotics in enhancing mortality, an outcome that is likely the result of secondary infection by more virulent pathogens. As a result, antibiotic use has two pivotal roles in prognosticating outcome from NP: outcome is improved if the correct therapy is chosen, but if this therapy is followed by superinfection, then mortality is much more likely, generally because these infections involve difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant organisms.",

This may occur because the patient has an inadequate immune response, often as the result of underlying comorbid illness; because of anatomic abnormalities (endobronchial obstruction, bronchiectasis); or because of therapy-induced dysfunction of the immune system (corticosteroids, endotracheal intubation).2, 45, 46 In addition, genetic variations in the immune response make some patients prone to overwhelming infection because of an inadequate response and others prone to acute lung injury because of an excessive immune response.16 In fact, the failure to localize the immune response to the respiratory site of initial infection may explain why some patients develop acute lung injury and sepsis because the inflammatory response extends to the entire lung and systemic circulation.47 Pneumonia can even occur in patients who have an adequate immune system, if the host defense system is overwhelmed by a large inoculum of bacteria (massive aspiration) or by a particularly virulent organism to which the patient has no preexisting immunity or to which the patient has an inability to form an adequate immune response. With this paradigm in mind, it is easy to understand why previously healthy individuals develop infection with virulent pathogens such as viruses (influenza), Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, for chronically ill patients, it is possible for them to be infected not by these virulent organisms but also by organisms that are not highly virulent. Because of host defense impairments, organisms that commonly colonize these patients can cause infection as a result of immune responses that are inadequate. These organisms include enteric gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and fungi (Aspergillus and Candida spp.).",

Other routes of entry include inhalation, which applies primarily to viruses, Legionella pneumophila and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; hematogenous dissemination from extrapulmonary sites of infection (right-sided endocarditis); and direct extension from contiguous sites of infection. In critically ill hospitalized patients, bacteria can also enter the lung from a colonized stomach (spreading retrograde to the oropharynx, followed by aspiration), a colonized or infected maxillary sinus, and colonization of dental plaque, or they can enter the lung directly via the endotracheal tube (from the hands of staff members).

Because condensate colonization occurs in 80% of tubings within 24 hours, it does not appear that frequent ventilator circuit changes are useful or even able to reduce the risk of pneumonia; in one study, tubing changes every 24 hours (rather than every 48 hours) served as a risk factor for pneumonia.55 Although most patients have ventilator tubing changed every 48 hours, several studies have shown no increased risk of infection if tubing is never changed or changed infrequently.56, 57 The use of heat moisture exchangers may be one way to avoid this problem, but they have had an inconsistent effect on preventing VAP. In addition, frequent changes of heat moisture exchangers (i.e., every 24 hours) have not been shown to have an impact on the incidence of VAP, and heat moisture exchangers should be changed no more frequently than every 48 hours.58\n",

Six criteria are scored on a scale from 0 to 2 for each, and pneumonia is diagnosed with a total score of at least 6 (out of a maximum of 12).62 The criteria are (1) fever, (2) purulence of sputum, (3) white blood cell count, (4) oxygenation, (5) degree of radiographic abnormality, and (6) the presence of pathogens in the sputum. Many studies have documented that VAP is diagnosed more often clinically than can be confirmed microbiologically, and the diagnosis is further obscured by the fact that most mechanically ventilated patients are colonized by enteric gram-negative bacteria. Thus the finding of potential pathogens in the sputum has no diagnostic value. In addition, some patients can have purulent sputum and fever, without a new infiltrate, and be diagnosed with purulent tracheobronchitis, an infectious complication of mechanical ventilation that may also require antibiotic therapy but is not pneumonia.2\n",

Recently, a toxin-producing strain of MRSA has been described to cause CAP in patients after influenza and other viral infections.

When quantitative cultures are collected, some investigators have defined the presence of pneumonia by the growth of bacteria at a concentration above a predefined threshold concentration.4, 5 Although the results can guide therapy decisions, most clinicians use antibiotic therapy, regardless of quantitative culture data, in patients who have clinical signs of sepsis and suspected pneumonia. Regardless of whether quantitative cultures are used, all patients with suspected NP should have a lower respiratory tract culture collected prior to the start of antibiotic therapy. If this is not a quantitative culture, then a sputum or tracheal aspirate should be obtained and the findings reported \u201csemiquantitatively\u201d as light, moderate, or heavy growth of bacteria.2, 5 Unfortunately, a negative culture is difficult to interpret if the patient has had initiation or change in antibiotic therapy in the preceding 72 hours.

The rationale for this approach was to provide broad antimicrobial coverage, prevent the emergence of resistance during therapy, and potentially provide synergistic activity if a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic was combined with an aminoglycoside (for P. aeruginosa pneumonia). However, only with bacteremic P. aeruginosa pneumonia has combination therapy (generally with an aminoglycoside and a \u03b2-lactam) been shown to be superior to monotherapy.81, 82 One practical problem to this approach is the aminoglycosides themselves, a class of antibiotics with a narrow therapeutic-to-toxic ratio, and a high incidence of nephrotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients. When these drugs are used, it is important to use enough antibiotic to achieve high peak serum levels to optimize efficacy but to also avoid elevated trough levels, which correlate with toxicity. When peak serum levels have been monitored, levels of more than 7 \u03bcg/mL for gentamicin and tobramycin and more than 28 \u03bcg/mL for amikacin have been associated with more favorable outcomes.83\n",

An analysis of the use of activated protein C for patients with septic shock demonstrated that 35% of the patients in the pivotal clinical trial had underlying CAP and that activated protein C was most effective for those CAP patients with an APACHE II score of greater than 25, a PSI class of IV or V, and a CURB-65 score of at least 2. Patients with pneumococcal infection and inadequate therapy also benefited, although the benefit was minimal in those treated with adequate therapy.94 In addition to their value in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency, corticosteroids may be helpful in severe CAP because of their immunomodulating effect. One randomized controlled trial of 48 patients compared hydrocortisone infusion (240 mg/day) with placebo and found that steroid therapy reduced mortality, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.95 These findings require other studies to confirm the benefit of this adjunctive therapy.",

If the patient is at risk for a second ICU-acquired infection (and most are), it may be prudent to use an aminoglycoside for the first episode of infection, reserving the quinolone for any subsequent infection, because of concern about quinolone induction of MDR, which could limit subsequent therapy options.102 If the patient is suspected of having MRSA because of a tracheal aspirate Gram stain showing gram-positive organisms or because of other risk factors, a third drug should be added.

If P. aeruginosa is present, combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and aminoglycoside should continue for 5 days, after which the patient can be switched to monotherapy with an agent to which the organism is sensitive.2 When de-escalation has been used, meaning either the switch to a more narrow spectrum regimen, the use of fewer drugs, or both, mortality in VAP has been reduced, compared with when patients do not have de-escalation.37, 38, 80 Many unrealized opportunities exist for using this approach in patients with P. aeruginosa infection and sensitive pathogens and in those with a good clinical response and negative respiratory tract cultures.80\n",

As a result, it may be possible to overcome the problems of poor lung penetration of certain agents (aminoglycosides) and provide the high levels of antibiotics that are necessary to kill certain resistant organisms. Locally administered antibiotics are rarely absorbed, and systemic toxicity is minimized. Despite these theoretical advantages, many efficacy questions remain to be answered by clinical trials.

Even for the patient who is recovering from CAP, immunization while in the hospital is appropriate to prevent future episodes of infection. The evaluation of all patients for vaccination need and the provision of information about smoking cessation are now performance standards used to evaluate the hospital care of CAP patients. If there is uncertainty about whether the patient has recently been vaccinated, it is probably best to give a pneumococcal vaccination because repeat administration, even more often than recommended, is not generally associated with an adverse reaction.106 Hospital-based immunization is recommended. One study found that among 1633 patients with pneumonia treated in the hospital, 62% had been hospitalized in the preceding 4 years.107 In addition, 80% of these patients had a high-risk condition that would have qualified them to receive pneumococcal vaccine.

In addition, any tube inserted into the stomach or trachea should be inserted through the mouth and not the nose, whenever possible, to avoid obstructing the nasal sinuses and prevent nosocomial sinusitis, which can lead to NP.110 A specially adapted endotracheal tube that allows for continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions may interrupt the oropharyngeal to tracheal transfer of bacteria and reduce the incidence of pneumonia.112 Because endotracheal intubation is a risk for pneumonia, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be used whenever possible. This approach is associated with a lower pneumonia risk than traditional mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic systemic or topical antibiotics have no specific role, but some data suggest that patients with coma caused by stroke or head trauma and those who may have aspirated during an emergent intubation may benefit from a 24-hour course of systemic antibiotics.113 \u201cSelective digestive decontamination,\u201d which includes systemic and topical intestinal antibiotics, remains controversial as a method to reduce the incidence of pneumonia.

Typically the crude mortality rate of this infection is 50%, with even higher rates seen in patients who are mechanically ventilated. Of all patients who die with NP, from one third to one half of these deaths are the direct result of infection termed \u201cattributable mortality.\u201d\u25aaA good, simple predictor of a poor outcome from CAP is the presence of at least 3 of the CURB-65 indicators: confusion, admission blood urea nitrogen greater than 19.6 mg/dL, low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure lower than 60 mm Hg), a respiratory rate higher than 30 breaths per minute, and age of at least 65.\u25aaThe most important risk factor for mortality in patients with VAP is inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Other risk factors for mortality include respiratory failure, coma on admission, bilateral radiographic abnormalities, and infection with resistant organisms.\u25aaA number of common therapeutic interventions increase the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia and should be chosen carefully. These include endotracheal intubation, corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunosuppressives, total parenteral nutrition, and certain strategies for feeding enterally and providing prophylaxis for intestinal bleeding.\u25aaThe most common pathogen for CAP is pneumococcus, with Legionella pneumophila and other atypical pathogens being a major concern in patients with severe CAP.\u25aaEnteric gram-negative bacteria are the most common pathogens causing NP, but MDR pathogens including gram-negatives and Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) can also occur, particularly when the patient has been in the hospital for at least 5 days and has received antibiotic therapy before the onset of pneumonia.\u25aa\nNP is often treated after making a clinical diagnosis, but this clinical approach is overly sensitive, and some patients who satisfy a clinical definition of pneumonia will have other disease processes.\u25aaInvasive diagnostic methods can be used to quantify the bacteriology of NP patients but may not always identify all patients with pneumonia, particularly in the presence of prior antibiotic therapy. Methodologic questions make these tools controversial in patient management, and it is uncertain if they favorably alter patient outcome.\u25aaEach ICU has its own unique bacteriology, and this information should be considered when choosing empiric therapy of NP.\u25aaIn choosing an antibiotic for a patient with severe pneumonia, take a history of recent antibiotic use and avoid using any agent prescribed in the past 3 months for a patient with CAP and any agent prescribed in the past 2 weeks for a patient with VAP.\u25aaAlthough initial empiric antibiotic therapy of severe pneumonia is necessarily broad-spectrum, efforts should be made to re-evaluate clinical response and microbiologic data to narrow the spectrum of therapy and the number of drugs. This can usually be done after 3 days, and patients with a good clinical response can have the duration of therapy reduced to 7 to 10 days.\u25aaIf the patient has not improved after 3 days of therapy, it is necessary to determine if there is another disease process other than pneumonia or if the infection is caused by a drug-resistant or unsuspected pathogen.\u25aaIn treating patients with severe pneumonia it is important to use the correct dose of the correct antibiotic. Using too low a dose can be a factor leading to poor outcome.\u25aaCAP can be prevented by the use of vaccines, particularly in hospital-based programs. The most widely used strategy for NP prevention is the use of \u201cventilator bundles,\u201d which may be valuable if carefully applied, but the impact of each individual component is unknown.\n\n",
