Breed classification can be divided by size or fur type. The size classification is more helpful to the practicing veterinarian and can be divided into small breeds, less than 2 kg (e.g., Netherland dwarfs, lion head, mini-lop, and Dutch breeds); medium breeds, 2 to 5 kg (e.g., Rex, English, Angora, and Belgium hares), and large to giant breeds, more than 5 kg (e.g., New Zealand whites, English lops, British Giants, and Flemish Giants). The American Rabbit Breeders Association publishes information on the different breeds and various standards, and is an excellent resource for veterinarians (http://www.arba.net/).",

Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. Unlike dogs and cats, rabbits lack footpads; instead, their feet are covered with thick coarse fur that protects the plantar and palmar surfaces of the feet. Because they lack footpads, rabbits should be provided soft padded areas within their enclosures. Rabbits have nonretractable claws, making declawing an inappropriate procedure. Certain breeds of female rabbits have a dewlap, which is analogous to a second chin. Female rabbits may pluck fur from the dewlap during the breeding season to build a nest. Male and female rabbits may have three types of scent glands, including a single chin gland, paired inguinal glands, and paired anal glands. The glands are used to mark the rabbit's territory.",

With the lateral positioning of their eyes and their large corneas, rabbits have an overlapping field of vision of 190 degrees.3 Although rabbits are visually acute within this region, they cannot visualize items below the horizon, including the area below their nose. Instead, rabbits use their highly sensitive vibrissae and lips as tactile structures to distinguish food items. Rabbits possess good night vision and some color vision. Rabbits have functional third eyelids that partially close with sleep or while under anesthesia.5 A harderian gland is found at the base of the third eyelid. If this gland prolapses, then it may present as a mass under the third eyelid. Surgical intervention is recommended to replace the gland. Tear drainage from the eyes occurs via the nasolacrimal gland. There is a single lacrimal punctum located in the craniomedial aspect of the lower eyelid. The punctum empties into a cuniculus, leading to a lacrimal sac and continuing to the base of the maxillary incisor. At this point, the duct sharply changes direction, runs along the incisor root, and emerges in the nasal cavity in the ventromedial aspect of the alar fold.2 Blockage of this duct is common in captive rabbits. Affected animals may have unilateral or bilateral epiphora. Rabbits have a large retrobulbar orbital venous plexus. When an enucleation is performed, this venous plexus must be ligated to minimize hemorrhage.",

In the dwarf breeds, sexual maturity occurs earlier than in larger breeds. The reproductive life of a rabbit is approximately 4 years.1 Rabbits are induced ovulators. Their receptivity periods last approximately 14 to 16 days, followed by 1 to 2 days of nonreceptivity.2 When females are ready to ovulate, they become restless, rub their chins, and assume a lordosis-like posture. Gestation lasts 31 to 32 days, and litters average 4 to 10 kits. As gestation or pseudopregnancy reaches the last 3 to 4 days, does initiate nesting behavior and line their nests with hair from the hip and dewlap.3 During this period, does consume less food, which can cause an increased risk for pregnancy toxemia. Parturition usually occurs in the early morning and lasts less than 30 minutes. Kits generally only suckle 1 or 2 times a day and are not usually seen with the doe, especially in the wild. Weaning occurs at approximately 4-6 weeks of age.",

The kidneys are generally covered in fat and can be palpated on the physical examination. The urinary bladder is located in the ventral body cavity, and it is ventral to the colon. Rabbits, like rodents, have a unique system for calcium metabolism. Serum calcium is reflective of dietary calcium, and the urinary system is the primary site of calcium and magnesium excretion. Rabbits that consume a high calcium diet will often have thick and creamy urine due to the formation of calcium carbonate precipitate. On average, rabbits produce 30 to 35 ml of urine daily. Rabbit urine may be straw-colored, yellow, or red. It is not uncommon for rabbit urine to have a turbid appearance. When a rabbit presents with \u201cred\u201d urine, it is important to differentiate whether the urine has blood or porphyrins. Porphyrins can be produced as a result of the ingestion of various vegetables, such as beet root, cabbage, broccoli, and dandelions, or as a result of stress.2\n",

Due to the positioning and well-developed nature of the cardiac sphincter, rabbits are unable to vomit.8 Adult rabbits have a gastric pH of 1.5 to 2.2, whereas suckling rabbits have a higher pH of 5.0 to 6.5. The higher gastric pH in neonates is necessary for bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract. This elevated pH also makes suckling rabbits more susceptible to gastrointestinal disease. Dietary absences, especially during weaning, should be gradual, and foods high in sugars and starch should be avoided. Rabbits have a large cecum that acts as an anaerobic fermentation vat. The cecum has a complex and delicate population of microbes. The most common organisms found in the rabbit cecum are the Gram-positive Bacillus spp. In the cecum, fiber is broken down and separated. Rabbits are highly susceptible to antibiotic-induced enterotoxemia, especially when there is Clostridium spiriforme contamination in the environment. The rabbit's gastrointestinal tract is designed to eliminate fiber from the gut rapidly, in the form of hard feces, and digest the nonfiber portion of the diet, creating caecotrophs, which are reingested at a later time. Cecotrophs are covered with a thin mucus, which protects the volatile fatty acids, vitamins, and amino acids from the low pH of the stomach. Cecotrophs differ from feces in that they are soft, moist, usually stuck together, and are eaten directly from the anus.8 The gastrointestinal transit time in rabbits is approximately 20 hours. Rabbits offered a diet deficient in fiber usually have increased gastrointestinal transit times.",

Because rabbits have a well-developed muscular system and thin cortical bone, they are subject to vertebral and long bone fractures if restrained incorrectly. Because most skeletal injuries associated with incorrect restraint occur in the lumbar vertebrae, it is important to firmly restrain the hindlegs. Rabbits should be handled in a manner similar to cats; place one hand on under the forelimbs, and use the other hand to hold the rear legs against the body. Always place the rabbit onto a nonslip surface to ensure that it has good footing. To restrain the animal, lightly scruff the animal and support its dorsum with the same arm. The opposite arm is used to support the body and rear legs (Figure 14-1\n). It can be helpful to tuck the head of the rabbit into the crook of one's elbow to decrease the rabbit's vision, which can decrease the stress on the animal. Placing a rabbit in dorsal recumbency evokes an immobility response, which can be helpful during simple procedures. However, this response is performed by prey species under stressful or threatening conditions and may not be welcomed by all rabbits (Figure 14-2\n). The immobility response is characterized by a lack of spontaneous movement and a failure to respond to external stimuli. This restraint technique should only be used in those cases where chemical sedation is not desired.2 A towel or blanket is usually necessary during the physical examination to cover the stainless steel exam table and to minimize slipping or kicking, which can lead to injury. In addition, a towel may be used to wrap the rabbit into a \u201cbunny burrito\u201d (Figure 14-3\n). The bunny burrito can be used to hold a rabbit for transport or to facilitate the examination of the head. Cat bags can also be used to restrain rabbits. In addition to using these techniques for examination, they can also be used to administer medication, collect blood samples, or perform nail trims.",

To examine the incisors, gently lift the lips for inspection. Be sure buccal surfaces are smooth (no horizontal ridges are present) and proper occlusion is met with mandibular incisors slightly caudal to the maxillary ones. A common noninvasive technique for examining the cheek teeth, which can be performed during every examination, is inserting an otoscope or vaginal speculum gently into the diasterna. Position the instrument caudally to visualize molars and premolars from both buccal and lingual surfaces (Figure 14-4\n). This technique does not provide the most thorough examination; however, it is relatively stress-free to the rabbit. If the rabbit is too stressed or uncooperative or a more thorough examination is necessary, lightly sedate the animal with an injectable sedative, or use isoflurane to get a better view. Once sedated, use a mouth speculum, mouth gag, or an endoscope to examine the molars (Figure 14-5\n). The most common locations for molar lesions are on the lingual surface of the mandibular cheek teeth and the buccal aspect of the maxillary teeth. The gingiva surrounding the molars should be at the level of the crowns except for the first mandibular cheek teeth in which the cranial aspect of the crowns will be more exposed. In addition to examining the teeth for overgrowth and malocclusion, it is important to inspect the oral mucosa and tongue for ulcerations and lacerations that may occur as a result of sharp points on teeth. The cheeks and jaws should be palpated for any swellings (e.g., abscesses) and the chin and dewlap examined for signs of drooling or slobbering. Abnormalities may be indicative of dental disease.",

Generally, this site can only be used to collect small blood samples. This vein can also be used to place a catheter; however, catheterization can lead to vascular necrosis, thrombosis, and sloughing of the ear and should be avoided in breeds with small ears (e.g., dwarf breeds). The lateral saphenous vein is suitable for small- to moderate-sized blood samples (Figure 14-6\n).

For systemic parasitologic disease, serologic testing or histopathology is required. E. cuniculi, a microsporidian, is generally diagnosed antemortem via serology or postmortem via histopathology. E. cuniculi is shed in the urine and may also be diagnosed from direct visualization in a urine sample, but this is not analytically sensitive. Eimeria steidae, a hepatic coccidian, can be diagnosed antemortem via a fecal direct smear or postmortem via histopathology.",

The interpretation of a single titer should be done cautiously. If a rabbit has a single positive titer, it suggests that the animal has been exposed to the infectious disease. To confirm that the animal has a current infection, a paired sample would need to be collected 2 to 3 weeks later. A two- to fourfold rise in the titer should be observed before concluding an animal is actively infected. However, in cases where the animal's first titer was already significantly elevated, a similarly high second titer may be used to confirm infection. If the titer is negative, then the animal may not have been exposed to the disease, or the result may have been a false negative. False negative results can occur during a peracute disease when a titer has not developed or when the immunoglobulin being measured (e.g., IgM or IgG) either has not been developed or has already passed.

Unfortunately, this microflora is extremely sensitive to several groups of orally administered antibiotics, including clindamycin, lincomycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalosporin, penicillin, and erythromycin.2 These antibiotics can lead to alterations in the microflora, resulting in fluctuations in the intestinal pH, an increase in volatile fatty acids, and proliferation of Clostridium spiriforme. The endotoxemia produced by this organism is responsible for the peracute death of rabbits. If there is no environmental exposure to endotoxin-forming bacteria, this condition will not occur. In general, oral antibiotics are also more likely to cause diarrhea than are parenterally administered antibiotics. Trimethoprim sulfa and enrofloxacin are considered two of the safest oral antibiotics and can be administered orally over extended periods of time. In comparison with oral penicillin, injectable penicillin can be used to treat disease with minimal risk of dysbiosis. Many veterinarians prescribe probiotics to minimize the risk for dysbiosis. Probiotics are comprised of bacteria considered to represent indigenous microflora. These anaerobic microbes are thought to compete for colonization sites within the intestines with pathogens, alter the microflora environment (e.g., pH fluctuations), and produce their own natural \u201cantibiotics\u201d to kill pathogenic bacteria. The true value of these products remains controversial; however, they do not appear to cause disease. Treatment for antibiotic dysbiosis is primarily focused on the provision of supportive care. Fluids should be given to correct losses associated with diarrhea. Calories should be provided to ensure gut motility. Offending antibiotics must be discontinued.

Both of the myxoma strains can cause lethal disease in the European rabbit.3, 16 Although rare, this virus has been found to cause high mortality in domestic rabbits from Oregon and California.19 This virus is transmitted via mosquitoes and fleas. The clinical signs associated with myxomatosis in natural hosts include swelling of the eyelids, face, head and testes/scrotum, the production of a milky ocular discharge, 1-cm mucoid cutaneous nodules, pyrexia, lethargy, depression, and anorexia. Infected domestic rabbits may become lethargic, pyrexic, anorectic, and develop skin hemorrhages and seizures.4 Death usually occurs within 14 days of clinical onset. Although the exact mechanism leading to the animal's demise is not well understood, it has been suggested that it is due to the proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria secondary to the immunosuppression caused by the virus. No effective therapy is known, and euthanasia is recommended.15 Cross-immunity can be achieved using a live, attenuated, Shope fibroma virus vaccine.

Sporulated oocysts represent the infectious stage.

E. cuniculi is shed transiently and can live for 4 weeks at room temperature. Clinical signs can vary depending upon the organ or system affected and the severity and duration of the disease. This protozoan affects primarily the kidneys, eyes, and neurologic system. Most infected rabbits present for vestibular disease. Clinical signs may include head tilt, hemiparesis, an inability to right itself, tumbling/rolling, seizures, ataxia, and paralysis (Figure 14-10\n). When E. cuniculi affects the neurologic system, the prognosis for recovery is grave. In some cases, rabbits show a reduction in vestibular signs but require life-long treatment. Without treatment, the quality of life is usually poor, and euthanasia is recommended. When the kidneys are affected, clinical signs may be absent because renal function is not usually altered. Cataracts and uveitis are common sequelae to ocular infections (Figure 14-11\n). Phacoemulsification is the treatment of choice for E. cuniculi\u2013induced cataracts. Without treatment, the lens can rupture and induce a phacoelastic uveitis. Diagnosing E. cuniculi antemortem is usually done from the physical examination, hematology, and serology. Serology is generally only used to rule out E. cuniculi infection; however, a positive titer does not conclusively rule in disease. Albendazole, fenbendazole, or oxibendazole is generally used to minimize the inflammatory response associated with the infection.4 Antibiotics that penetrate the blood-brain barrier (e.g., chloramphenicol) can be used to combat opportunistic infections. Diazepam can be used to control seizures. Although some corticosteroids have been used for treating E. cuniculi, they can cause immunosuppression and should be used with caution. The steroid's primary benefit is to increase the uptake of the respective antiparasitics. Life-long treatment is required to minimize the clinical signs associated with the disease.23\n",

            "text": "Hairballs, or trichobezoars, are most common in rabbits fed diets with inadequate fiber. Stress, barbering, and nest building have also been associated with the formation of trichobezoars. Anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea, small dry feces or an absence of feces, hair loss, and a palpable firm mass in the cranial abdomen are common findings in affected rabbits. A thorough history, physical examination, and survey radiographs (\u00b1 contrast) are generally required to make a diagnosis. Endoscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis. A history of anorexia in combination with a soft tissue density in the stomach is highly suggestive of gastric trichobezoars (Figure 14-13\n). Positive or negative contrast radiography can be used to help outline a trichobezoar. In most cases, medically managing a trichobezoar yields a higher treatment success than does surgery. However, there are cases where surgical intervention is the only method that can be used to treat a trichobezoar. Treatment should focus on rehydrating the gastric contents through fluid administration and providing motility stimulants, analgesics, antibiotics, and nutritional support. Fresh greens and hay should be offered to animals that are still eating. Rabbits that are anorectic should be force-fed a critical care diet (Oxbow Pet Products, Murdock, NE) to prevent hepatic lipidosis. Fresh pineapple juice contains the enzyme bromelain, and this enzyme is thought to have ceratolytic properties (5-10 ml BID).7 Papaya and prozyme may also be used to assist in the digestion of the trichobezoar. Metoclopramide or cisapride can be used to stimulate gastric motility; however, this should not be used if impaction is suspected. A broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as enrofloxacin or trimethoprim sulfa, is generally used to limit the overgrowth of bacterial pathogens. Analgesics, such as buprenorphine, flunixin meglumine, metacam, or carprofen, can be used to minimize the pain associated with the alterations in gastrointestinal motility. Without treatment, trichobezoars can lead to malnutrition and death or gastric rupture causing fatal peritonitis.26 If the ingested material is synthetic (e.g., carpeting), surgery is usually required. The prognosis for cases going to surgery is generally considered guarded to grave; however, if the animal is stabilized before the procedure, then the likelihood for success is higher.",

There are a number of suspected etiologies attributed to the development of abnormal tooth wear, including genetics, anatomy, and nutrition. Feeding rabbits a pelleted diet can actually alter the natural movements associated with mastication by reducing the lateral, and increasing the vertical, jaw action.7 The most common sites to find dental pathology (e.g., sharp points) are the lingual side of the mandibular teeth and the buccal surface of the maxillary teeth. Correcting these abnormalities is generally sufficient to get the rabbit eating again. With sedation, these sharp points can be floated or drilled down to appropriate length and angle to allow for a more natural bite (Figure 14-15\n). When evaluating the teeth of a rabbit, it is important to take radiographs to evaluate the tooth roots for any pathology (e.g., abscesses) (Figure 14-16\n). For chronic incisor overgrowth, removal is recommended. For cheek teeth abnormalities, removal of nondiseased teeth that oppose missing teeth or normal teeth left behind after the conspecific tooth is removed is not recommended unless essential, because they can be difficult to remove and possibly result in the fracture of an attached bone.",

The most common sites for metastasis include the liver, lungs, mammary glands, brain, and bones. Rabbits with uterine adenocarcinoma can present with a range of clinical signs, including hematuria, vaginal discharge, decreased fertility, increased kit mortality, depression, anorexia, dyspnea, and cystic mammary glands. A diagnosis can be made from a thorough history (e.g., age, intact), physical examination, CBC, chemistry panel, whole body radiographs, and ultrasound. It is often possible to palpate an enlarged uterus in rabbits with uterine adenocarcinoma. The neoplastic organ will palpate as a tubular structure in the caudoventral abdomen. An increased soft tissue density in the same area may be seen radiographically. Thoracic radiographs should be taken to assess the patient for metastasis. If metastasis to the lungs has occurred, then the prognosis is grave. If metastasis has not occurred, then an ovariohysterectomy is recommended. During the surgical procedure, the abdomen should be inspected for localized metastasis. Any suspect tissues should be biopsied.4\n",

Discomfort caused by tooth malocclusion can lead to drooling, and the chronic wetness associated with the drooling predisposes the animal to bacterial dermatitis. Skin fold pyoderma is a common problem in obese animals; the sites most commonly affected are the dewlap, perianal, and genital areas. Treatment for those conditions requires aggressive wound debridement. Fur from the affected area should be clipped to provide adequate exposure. The wound should be cleaned with a topical disinfectant (e.g., Betadine or chlorhexidine). To control bacterial infections, we recommend using a hyperosmotic solution (e.g., 50% dextrose). The wound should be liberally irrigated with the 50% dextrose solution. After 1 to 2 minutes, the wound should be irrigated with isotonic saline to remove the dextrose. Extended contact with the dextrose can dry out the healing tissue. The procedure should be repeated at least three times, twice daily. In addition to this topical treatment, obese animals should be placed on a calorie-restrictive diet. This is best achieved by reducing the amount of pellets and providing (ad libitum) grass hay (e.g., timothy hay). Surgery may be required to remove excess skin folds.

            "text": "Dermal abscesses are a common presentation in rabbits and can occur anywhere on the body. Abscesses in rabbits are generally more caseous in nature than in other mammals. The thick, caseous nature of rabbit abscesses limits their drainage, and the use of standard Penrose drains is usually futile. Treating abscesses with (only) systemic antibiotics is ineffective, as the nucleus of the abscess in unaffected by the treatment. To effectively treat rabbit abscesses, the entire abscess (including the capsule) must be removed. In cases where the abscess and capsule are removed, the prognosis is good; however, in most cases the capsule is inherently attached to vital organs or bone and is difficult to remove. When it is impossible to extract the entire capsule, as much of the capsule should be removed as possible to avoid contact between caseous material and unaffected tissue. Culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing of the purulent material or capsule is recommended. Abscesses that cannot be completely removed should be left open for daily cleansing and debridement. When choosing a topical antibiotic therapy, be sure to select antibiotics that will not induce bacterial dysbiosis when the rabbit grooms itself. Penicillin (80,000 IU/kg) or ampicillin (20 mg/kg), although not to be given orally because of the potential for dysbiosis, can be used parenterally to treat local skin abscesses. In our experience, the application of honey to the abscess as a hyperosmotic has produced moderate success. The honey, in addition to acting as an antimicrobial, encourages a rabbit to groom or lick at the area and promotes drainage.2 The honey also acidifies the area and promotes healing. Systemic oral antimicrobials and analgesics should also be considered when treating rabbit abscesses.29 Antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads can also be used to manage rabbit abscesses. Heat-stable antibiotics must be used to make PMMA beads. Amikacin 1.25 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, cefazolin 2 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, cephalothin 2 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, gentamicin 1 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, or tobramycin 1 g/20 g methylmethacrylate are all appropriate for PMMA beads.30 Treating abscesses in rabbits can be frustrating and may require multiple procedures. In some cases, treatment is not successful, and amputation may be the only option. Owners should always be made aware of their pet's prognosis before treatment is initiated. Systemic antibiotics are appropriate for generalized abscesses. Antimicrobial treatment is ideally based on culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. While testing is pending, abscesses can be treated with benzathine/penicillin G procaine (40,000 IU/kg SC SID \u00d7 14 days, then q48h \u00d7 2 weeks); enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO BID); or metronidazole (30 mg/kg PO BID).30, 35 The use of trime thoprim sulfa-dimethoxine should be avoided when there is caseous material present because the antibiotic is inactivated by pus.",

Rabbits housed on an inappropriate flooring surface alter their weight distribution and bear the brunt of their weight on their metatarsus and hock instead of on the claws and plantar surface of the feet.2 This shift in weight leads to the medical displacement of the superficial flexor tendon, which can exacerbate the condition.2 Treatment is aimed at relieving the pressure on the affected area. A nonabrasive, dry surface should be provided. Providing an affected animal time during the day on a grass lawn or deep bed of hay is helpful. A thick foam rubber pad, towels, or newspaper substrate can also be used to minimize the likelihood of exacerbating this disease. Skin wounds can be managed using the technique described previously. Surgical skin glue can be used to protect the wounds. A padded splint can be used to alleviate any pressure on the lesions. Opportunistic infection should be managed with appropriate antibiotics. Analgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, opioids) should be used to alleviate discomfort. Underlying problems, such as obesity and inappropriate substrate, should be corrected.

Otitis externa is a common problem, and it is most often associated with a parasitic or bacterial predisposition. Parasitic infections were described previously (see Parasitic Disease).32 Lop breeds are predisposed to developing bacterial otitis because of the flexion of the cartilage at the base of their ears. Rabbits with otitis externa may present for shaking, pruritus, erythematous pinna, malodor, and possible auricular discharge. Because otitis externa can be painful, care should be taken when manipulating the ears; we prefer to treat affected rabbits with systemic antibiotics and antiinflammatories rather than treating the ears topically. Bacterial cultures should be collected before treatment. Otitis externa can advance to otitis media or otitis interna. Otitis interna should be ruled out in rabbits with a head tilt. Radiographs and/or CT scans can be used to assess the tympanic bullae. In severe otitis cases, a permanent osteotomy may be required.32 The most common causes of conjunctivitis in rabbits are bacterial infections (e.g., Pasteurella), trauma, and entropion. When evaluating rabbit eyes, the approach to the examination should be similar to that for other mammals. Unless trauma has been acknowledged in the history, a thorough work-up should be pursued, including a cytologic scraping and bacterial culture. For confirmed bacterial infections, topical antibiotics can be used. Treatment regimens may require three to four doses daily. Application of topical antibiotics three to four times a day in addition to removing the initial cause of conjunctivitis is recommended. Entropion is a common presentation in large breed and obese rabbits, and surgical resection is necessary for resolution.21\n",

Clinical signs can vary, but generally include difficulty with prehension of food, anorexia, cachexia, dacryocystitis, abnormal facial swelling, and excessive salivation. Incisor malocclusion has been attributed to congenital factors, such as mandibular prognathism, and is seen at an increased rate in rabbits less than 1.5 kg or certain breeds (e.g., Netherland dwarf rabbits).2 Animals that suffer traumatic injuries to the jaws are also more susceptible to developing tooth malocclusion. Abnormal incisor growth can lead to the blockage of the nasolacrimal duct, resulting in epiphora. Incisor malocclusion can also lead to molar malocclusion, causing further dental complications. Trimming incisors is the primary method for correcting malocclusion, and this can be done using a high-speed Dremel tool (Dremel, Racine, WI) or dental drill (Figure 14-19\n). Incisors grow at a rate of 3 mm per week when the opposing incisor is present and 1 mm per day when there is no tooth opposition. Therefore, trimming should be done at approximately 3-week intervals when there is a malocclusion or no opposing incisor. Toenail clippers have been recommended for trimming incisors; we do not recommend this, as toenail clippers have been associated with tooth fracture. Where there is severe malocclusion, complete incisor extraction is recommended. This is a relatively easy procedure; however, it does require patience. Aggressive, rough manipulation of the teeth can lead to tooth fracture and, again, pain and discomfort. (This procedure is discussed in detail in Surgery.) If the entire root and germinal tissue are not removed, the teeth can regenerate, requiring additional surgery.",

Coronal overgrowth (due to incisor overgrowth or poor occlusion) requires not only that the spikes be removed but also that the crowns be reduced and the angulation be corrected for ideal occlusion. Maxillary cheek teeth and all but the first mandibular cheek teeth can be reduced to the level of the gingiva; however, this is not always necessary. In some cases, removing the points is sufficient. The gingiva naturally exposes the cranial aspect of the first mandibular cheek tooth. Ideally, when trimming or floating the cheek teeth, the procedure should be done with power equipment (e.g., flat fissure bur) to ensure rapid tooth removal without damaging the surrounding tissue. The use of rasps or clippers can create friction and rock the teeth, causing periapical and periodontal damage. For this reason, these tools are not recommended or should be used with extreme caution. Extraction of the cheek teeth is much more complicated than removal of the incisor and more traumatic to the rabbit. (Crossley DA, personal communication) When several extractions are required, it is best to perform multiple procedures to minimize the pain and discomfort to the animal. For example, extracting the teeth on one side of the jaw will allow the animal to still use the opposite side to process its food. (Cheek tooth extraction is discussed in detail in Surgery.)",

Rabbits with URTD are often anorectic, as they cannot smell or locate their food. Serous to purulent nasal discharge is common. Epiphora is also a common finding. Many rabbits with clinical disease have snuffles. This is a generic term used to describe clinical signs, but it is attributed primarily to pasteurellosis. It is important to recognize that snuffles is nonspecific and may be associated with any of the previously mentioned causes. Rabbits with URTD often have \u201cwet\u201d forelegs as a result of the chronic nasal discharge. In severe cases of URTD, when a rabbit cannot move air through its nasal passages, it becomes dyspneic and breathes with an open mouth. Hematologic testing (e.g., CBC), culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing, radiographs, and endoscopy may be required to diagnose a specific cause of URTD.

Primary lung neoplasia can occur, but it is not common. Rabbits are more likely to develop secondary metastasis. Rabbits with pneumonia may present in either an acute or chronic disease state. Rabbits with acute pneumonia are often acutely depressed, lethargic, and anorectic. The rabbits may or may not have audible respiratory sounds (e.g., wheezing, crackling). On physical examination, the rabbit may be febrile, have nasal discharge, and have auscultable respiratory wheezing or crackling. With chronic pneumonic presentations, the rabbit may appear clinically normal (e.g., walking pneumonia) but may have abnormal lung sounds. Beyond the physical examination, a CBC, survey radiographs, tracheal wash with cytologic examination and culture and antibiotic sensitivity profile, and endoscopic examination can be used to diagnose the pneumonic condition and establish a prognosis.

When rabbits stop eating, physiologic changes can occur in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., mucosal atrophy) that alter the gastrointestinal permeability. From this, a cascade of events can occur (e.g., reduced motility, decreased water absorption, pH alterations, microbial flora changes) that lead the animal into a life-threatening situation. The first step in managing these cases should be to restimulate the gastrointestinal tract, and the second step is to diagnose the cause of the anorexia. Providing nutritional support is the best method for restimulating the gastrointestinal tract. Motility modifiers can also be used, but these should be given only when there is no concern for a gastric or small intestine foreign body (e.g., trichobezoar).",

Blind intubation using a 2.0 to 2.5 outside diameter (OD) endotracheal tube can be done, but it can be associated with laryngeal trauma.9 To perform the procedure, the head should be elevated and neck stretched. The endotracheal tube should be gently lowered into the trachea. This technique requires patience and skill. Practicing this technique on recently expired rabbits is one way of obtaining experience with this procedure. Our preferred method for intubating rabbits is via an endoscope.39 A 2.7-mm rigid endoscope can be used to directly visualize the larynx and ensure passage of the tube into the trachea.

The ovary and uterine horns should be gently grasped and elevated from the body cavity. Rabbits have two separate uterine horns, each with its own cervix (Figure 14-21\n). Each uterine horn should be ligated just cranial to its cervix. A circumferential and transfixation suture can be used to ligate the uterine horn.
