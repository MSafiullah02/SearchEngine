The hypothesis is based in part on the abundant epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence of an association of infectious agents with autoimmune disease and observed cross-reactivity of immune reagents with host 'self' antigens and microbial determinants. For our purpose, molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the molecules' linear amino acid sequences or their conformational fits may be shared, even though their origins are as separate as, for example, a virus and a normal host-self determinant. An immune response against the determinant shared by the host and virus can evoke a tissue-specific immune response that is presumably capable of eliciting cell and tissue destruction. The probable mechanism is generation of cytotoxic cross-reactive effector lymphocytes or antibodies that recognize specific determinants on target cells. The induction of cross-reactivity does not require a replicating agent, and immune-mediated injury can occur after the immunogen has been removed-a hit-and-run event. Hence, the viral or microbial infection that initiates the autoimmune phenomenon may not be present by the time overt disease develops. By a complementary mechanism, the microbe can induce cellular injury and release self antigens, which generate immune responses that cross-react with additional but genetically distinct self antigens. In both scenarios, analysis of the T cells or antibodies specifically engaged in the autoimmune response and disease provides a fingerprint for uncovering the initiating infectious agent.-Oldstone, M.

In addition to a genetic link and, in several instances, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 2 disease association (1) (2) (3) , other factors (including environmental ones) must be involved. For example, there is strong clinical/epidemiological evidence that monozygotic twins show a striking discordance for several autoimmune diseases like insulin-dependent diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and HLA-B27-associated ankylosing spondylitis (4) (5) (6) . In addition, when the antibody or T cell receptor associated with disease has been available for structural analysis, primarily somatic mutations, suggesting an antigen-driven process rather than germline mutations, have been found (7, 8) . Other evidence comes from observations that human viral infections are often associated with autoimmune responses (reviewed in ref 9) . Hence, newly formed autoimmune responses or those already present are enhanced after infection by a wide variety of human DNA and RNA viruses. In addition, experimental acute and persistent infections with either DNA or RNA viruses have induced, accelerated, or enhanced autoimmune responses and caused autoimmune disease. Perhaps the best-known instance occurs during evaluation of the New Zealand mouse model (10) . In this system of genetically defined mice that spontaneously develop autoimmune disease, persistent infection with a DNA virus like polyoma or an RNA virus like lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus speeds up the time when antibodies to DNA, red blood cells, and other autoantigens appear. Thus, the kinetics and severity of the resulting autoimmune disease are dramatically accelerated. More germane is the NZW mouse, which normally does not develop autoimmune response or disease but contains the necessary gene(s) to develop the anti-DNA and other autoimmune responses and disease and does so after viral infection. Others have reported epidemiologic and serologic correlations between viral infections and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) (11, 12) , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (13, 14) , bacterial infections, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (15) . For example, coxsackie B virus Figure 1 . Illustration of the molecular mimicry concept along with associated guidelines. The sharing of a linear amino acid sequence or a conformation fit between a microbe and a host 'self' determinant is the initial stage of molecular mimicry. Autoimmunity may occur if the host immune response against the microbe cross-reacts with the host's 'self' sequence and if the host sequence comprises a biologically important domain, i.e., the encephalitogenic site of a myelin protein incriminated in CNS or demyelinating disease, the component of the acetylcholine receptor important for synapse formation, or the hypervariable region of MHC molecule (HLA B27) associated with disease. and rubella virus have been linked with IDDM; in a few instances, coxsackie B virus has been directly isolated from pancreatic tissues of individuals with acute IDDM (14, 16) . Inoculation of the isolated virus into mice produced diabetes, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates (16) . Several viruses have been associated with MS (17) (18) (19) (20) , and there is abundant epidemiologic evidence of a close association of viral infection with exacerbations of this demyelinating disease (11, 12, 20) . Robust epidemiologic evidence correlates the occurrence of certain bacterial infections such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella, and Yersinia with the initial onset of acute Reiter's syndrome, followed by AS in HLA B27 / individuals (15, 21) . Last, there are transgenic models in which mice expressing an autoimmune gene and/or its T cell recognition (TCR)/antibodies required to develop autoimmune disease do not do so unless there is an environmental switch, i.e., movement from a pathogen-free animal facility to a standard vivarium (22, 23) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 163, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 482, "end": 485, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 486, "end": 489, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 490, "end": 493, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 728, "end": 731, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 732, "end": 734, "text": "8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 868, "end": 870, "text": "9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1288, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2052, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2056, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2106, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2110, "text": "14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2171, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3061, "text": "(14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3062, "end": 3065, "text": "16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3168, "end": 3172, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3220, "end": 3224, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3225, "end": 3229, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3230, "end": 3234, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3235, "end": 3239, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3378, "end": 3382, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3383, "end": 3386, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3387, "end": 3390, "text": "20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3647, "end": 3651, "text": "(15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3652, "end": 3655, "text": "21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3951, "end": 3955, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3956, "end": 3959, "text": "23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2205, "end": 2213, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Microbial agents or viruses can induce autoimmune responses and diseases by a variety of mechanisms, several of which may occur during an infection. For example, proteins of certain infectious agents have a proliferative effect on unique lymphocyte subsets and hence act as polyclonal activators. Viruses can preferentially infect/destroy a particular T cell subset, leading to an imbalance in the immune response. In other instances, infectious agents can up-regulate Th.1 cytokines, thereby increasing selected expression of molecules such as MHC glycoproteins, as well as activation and costimulatory molecules such as B7.1/CD28. Several microbial agents have been found to encode superantigens that can selectively activate subset(s) of T cells (24) (25) (26) . In other cases, viruses may break self tolerance by de novo release of self epitopes presumably by direct injury caused by the virus or secondarily by the virusspecific T cells generated. Either way, damage can occur by a procedure called epitope spreading (27, 28) . Microbes can also direct the release of cytokines and chemokines, important regulators of immune responses. These molecules can act as growth, differentiation, or chemotactic factors for different Th populations and regulate expression of MHC class I and class II molecules. Thus, an infectious agent could release a cytokine-like interferon that induces the expression of MHC determinants. In addition, microbes-especially viruses-can infect and selectively replicate in unique lymphocyte subsets and, by their presence, activation, or replication, cause immunosuppression or immunoenhancement. Last, microbes can contain chemical structures that mimic normal host 'self' proteins, an event termed molecular mimicry (Fig. 1) . Several possibilities are listed in Table 1 . Of these, molecular mimicry is the focus of this review. Whereas there is heightened suspicion that infectious agents and molecular mimicry play a role in several autoimmune diseases, direct evidence has been hard to come by. There are a number of reasons for this discrepancy: for instance, the organism initiating the autoimmune process may be cleared by the host immune response, thus removing our ability to isolate it. However, the initiated immune response would continue the process against cross-reactive 'self' determinant, a 'hit-and-run' scenario.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 749, "end": 753, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 754, "end": 758, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "(27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1031, "text": "28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1751, "end": 1759, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1805, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The initial clues that molecular mimicry might play a role in autoimmune diseases were found in the early 1980s associated with the development and use of monoclonal antibody technology.

An early observation used myelin basic protein and allergic encephalomyelitis. The myelin basic protein sequences that cause allergic encephalitis are known and the encephalitogenic site of 8-10 amino acids has been mapped for several different animal species. With the use of computer-assisted analysis (32) , several viral proteins were uncovered that showed significant homology with the encephalitogenic site of myelin basic protein, including fits between the myelin basic protein and nucleoprotein of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, core protein of adenovirus, EC-LF2 protein of Epstein- Barr virus, and hepatitis B virus polymerase as well as others. However, the best fit occurred between the myelin basic protein encephalitogenic site in the rabbit and hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBVP). It was then shown that inoculation of HBVP peptide peripherally into rabbits caused perivascular infiltration localized to the central nervous system, reminiscent of disease induced by inoculation of whole myelin basic protein or the peptide component of the encephalitogenic site of myelin basic protein (34; Fig.  4 ). Further, a specific immune response to both cellular and humoral to myelin basic protein occurred. Thereafter, several other animal models were developed showing cross-reactivity between a microbe and self antigen leading to disease. For example, coxsackie B3 virus shared sequence homology with heart myosin or other myocardial proteins (i.e., GAP junction), and experimental manipulations in experimental animals led to myocardial necrosis and myocarditis (35) (36) (37) .

Wucherpfennig and Strominger used the known structure for MHC class II diseaseassociated molecules with peptide binding and TCR for a known immunodominant myelin basic protein peptide. By database search, a panel of 129 peptides from microbes were obtained that matched the molecular mimicry motif, and these were tested on several T cell clones obtained from the cerebral spinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients (47) . Eight peptides (seven of viral and one of bacterial origin) were found to efficiently activate three of these clones, whereas only one of the eight peptides would have been identified as an appropriate molecular mimic by sequence alignment. These observations indicated that a single T cell receptor could recognize several distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens, suggesting more permissivity for TCR than previously appreciated, an observation supported by other recent reports (49-51).

An illustration of a model we developed for analysis of virus-induced IDDM is shown in Fig. 6 , with the model described in refs 52 and 53. The cardinal observations uncovered through the analysis of this model are as follows. 1) Lymphocytes in the periphery are ignorant or unresponsive to the 'self' protein, but can be activated in the absence of viral infection by coexpressing cytokines like interferon-g or activation molecules such as B7.1 in the target (b cells) area. 2) Infection by the same virus from which the 'self' protein was used as a transgene or a closely related virus that both crossreacts and induces sufficient effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) also causes the autoimmune disease. 3) If the transgene is expressed only in the target tissue, the autoimmune disease occurs rapidly, with kinetics of disease occurring by 10-4 days. Such positively selected high affinity effector T cells kill beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. The effector cell is a CD8 CTL and killing is dependent on perforin and interferon-g. However, if the transgene is also expressed in the thymus, then the kinetics for initiation of disease after viral infection is prolonged. 4) Depending on the MHC haplotype, disease takes between 1 and 7 months to occur. 5) Whereas the rapidonset autoimmune disease uses high affinity effector CTL, in contrast to the slow-onset autoimmune disease, the majority of high affinity T cells have been selected out in the thymus (negative selection) and only low affinity cells are available in the periphery to participate in causing the autoimmune disease. 6) For low affinity CD8 / T cells to produce disease, they require help from CD4, but such help is not necessary for the rapid-onset disease. 7) Expression of Th. .

The viral gene product is placed in the b cells of the islets of Langerhans using the rat insulin promoter and transgenic technology. In a second scenario, the transgene is inserted and expressed in the thymus as well as the b cells of the islets. Because the transgene (viral gene) is inserted in the germline of the host and passed to subsequent progeny, it is in essence a host 'self' gene.

These models allow the design of therapeutic approaches to prevent or reverse the disease process at different steps along the way. . IDDM did not occur by this means; CD4 / and CD8 / T cells did not accumulate in the islets, but were found around them (peri-islitis). Further, the precursor frequency of the effector CD8 / T cells was diminished by several-fold, below a level required to cause IDDM. Another successful approach was to abort the expression of MHC class I molecule by coexpressing the E3 transcriptional complex of adenovirus in b cells of the islets of Langerhans (60) . The focal reduction of MHC class I expression in the islets was associated with a normal precursor frequency of CD8 / CTLs in the spleen and blood.

B. A. Oldstone, J. E. Gairin, and M. G. von Herrath, unpublished results). Thus, there is the opportunity to obtain autoreactive T cells to 'self' antigen and use this information to uncover the infectious agent that initiated (was associated with) the autoimmune process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 509, "text": "(59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 510, "end": 513, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 514, "end": 517, "text": "62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 579, "end": 612, "text": "Wucherpfennig and Strominger (47)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 748, "end": 753, "text": "Those", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 307, "text": "(Fig.  6)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "USING MOLECULAR MIMICRY MODELS TO DISSECT THE PARAMETERS REQUIRED FOR THE ACTIVATION AND ASSOCIATION OF VIRUS-INDUCED AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE"}, {"text": "In summary, molecular mimicry is but one mechanism by which autoimmune diseases can occur in association with infectious agents. The concept of molecular mimicry remains a viable hypothesis for framing questions and approaches to uncover the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the 'self' determinant, understanding the pathogenetic mechanism(s) involved, and designing strategies for treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders. The availability of computer databanks, structural information on specific MHC alleles, MHC mapping to particular autoimmune diseases, and the ability to identify the anchoring and flanking sequences of a peptide that binds to that MHC allele or bind to the TCR provide the opportunity to critically evaluate and identify microbial causes of autoimmune diseases. The application and use of transgenic models designed to evaluate molecular mimicry offer the opportunity to understand the sequence of events leading to the pathology and design of specific and unique therapies in order to reverse or prevent the autoimmune process and disease.

Table 3 tabulates these findings (details can be found in refs 52-60; M. G. von Herrath, B. Coon, H. Mazarguil, J. E. Gairin, and M. B. A. Oldstone, unpublished results). These observations allow the design of therapeutic approaches to halt the virus-induced IDDM. When the cytokine profile in the islets of Langerhans milieu was changed from a Th.1 to a Th.2 phenotype (ginterferon to IL-4, TGF-b), IDDM was blocked even though this therapy had no demonstrable effect on precursor frequency of the effector CD8 / CTL (58; R. Mueller-Hoenger, M. G. von Herrath, X. Zhang, G. Patstone, T. Krahl, B. Coon, M. B. A. Oldstone, and N. Sarvetnick, unpublished results). A second successful therapeutic approach was to design a peptide that could bind at high affinity to the MHC allele involved in the IDDM (59; M. G. von Herrath, B. Coon, H. Mazarguil, J. E.
