Left lower lobe atelectasis is common following coronary artery bypass grafting. Radiological signs include displaced fissures; crowded bronchovascular markings and shifts in the positions of the hila, diaphragm, and mediastinum; and increased density or radiopacity of the lung tissue. Fever and leukocytosis may not always be present.Aspiration: It occurs in patients with impaired consciousness, regurgitation of enteral feed and microaspiration around endotracheal tube cuff. Right lower lobe is commonly involved. Infiltrates may take up to 12 h to appear in the chest X-ray after the event. History of vomiting or bile-colored endotracheal secretions on suctioning is a clue to the diagnosis. It may be a purely chemical pneumonitis initially, caused by acidic gastric contents.Pulmonary embolism with infarction: It is generally acute onset in the background of risk factors for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). Diagnosis can be confirmed by CT Pulmonary Angiography.Pulmonary hemorrhage may resemble dense alveolar consolidation. Generally, endotracheal (ET) secretions are bloodstained. Coagulation profiles or other immunological markers may be deranged.Cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the following:Patient risk factors for infection with MDR pathogensThe classical distinction and treatment of ventilator associated pneumonia based on early and late onset VAP concept seems inappropriate as it may result in low intensity treatment for multi-drug resistant pathogens that are commonly seen in early onset VAP as well as aggressive high intensity treatment in late onset VAP on the assumption that it is always caused by resistant pathogens. No significant difference in pathogens have been found between early & late onset VAP. New guidelines suggest that the antibiotic therapy should focus on presence of risk factors for MDR pathogens rather than early or late VAP. It is suggested that hospital admission rather than intubation should be taken as the starting point.Recent exposure to specific antibiotic classesLocal epidemiology of infection and antibiogram- the common organisms to cause VAP include Gram negative ESBL enterobacteriacae, Non fermenters like pseudomonas and acinetobacter and gram positives like MRSAPrevious antibiotic therapyDetailed history should be taken to identify patients who are at high risk of drug-resistant infection as mentioned below:Intravenous Antimicrobial therapy in preceding 90 daysCurrent hospitalization of 5 days or moreSeptic shock at the time of VAPARDS preceding VAPNeed of renal replacement therapy before VAPRisk factor for MDR gram negative Bacilli and Pseudomonas aeuginosaTreatment in an ICU where more than 10% of gram negative isolates are resistant to an agent considered for monotherapyTreatment in an ICU in which local antimicrobial susceptibility rates are not knownRisk factors for MRSATreatment in a unit in which >10 to 20% of staphylococcal aureus isolates are methicillin resistantTreatment in a unit in which prevalence of MRSA is not known\n",

It is suggested to use PK/PD data for antibiotic dosing.Ventilator associated tracheobronchitis should preferably not be treated with antibiotic therapy.Follow the antibiotic policy of your unit/hospital.For starting antibiotic therapy in suspected VAP, clinical criteria alone should be used rather than clinical criteria + serum procalcitonin or CRP or CPIS.The duration of antibiotic therapy should be seven days and not more.Monitoring serial procalcitonin level can help guide the decision to discontinue antibioticSpecific recommendations based on new guidelines:Patients with risk factors for infection with MDR VAPPiperacillinTazobactam/Imipenem/Meropenem/Ceftazidime/Cefepime/AztreonamPlusAmikacin/Gentamicin/Tobramycin/Levofloxacin/Ciprofloxacin/Aztreonam (if not used earlier)PlusVancomycin/Linezolid/TeicoplaninPatient with No risk factor for MDR pathogen and No Risk factors for MDR gram negative pathogen and no Risk factor for MRSAPiperacillin/Tazobactam/Cefepime/LevofloxacinPatients with Risk factors for MRSA:Vancomycin/Linezolid/TeicoplaninOther recommendationsIf Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem or meropenem are being used for empiric cover, it is not necessary to add specific MSSA cover like oxacillin, nafcillin or cefazolin.Piperacillin/Tazobactam used with Vancomycin has been associated with acute kidney injury.Aminoglycosides, Polymyxins should be avoided in suspected VAP, if other gram negative antibiotics are available and provide adequate cover.In cases of VAP due to gram negative bacilli susceptible only to aminoglycosides or Polymyxins, it is suggested to use both inhaled and intravenous (systemic) antibiotics rather than systemic antibiotics alone.In cases of VAP due to Acinetobacter species, use a carbapenem or a BL-BLI (betalactam\u2014beta lactam inhibitor) combination like ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam (if the isolate is susceptible to these antibiotics).In cases of VAP due to Acinetobacter species sensitive only to Polymyxins, it is recommended to use intravenous Polymyxins (colistin or Polymyxin B) along with inhaled colistin. Do not use rifampicin in such cases.Do not use tigecycline in VAP caused by Acinetobacter species.Use of Inhaled antibiotics: For treating VAP, the lung concentration of the antibiotic must exceed the MIC of infecting pathogen Penetration of some systemic antibiotics like Colistin, Beta lactams, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides into lung is not as effective as flouroquinolones. Targeting lungs with aerosolized antibiotics in ventilated patients in addition to intravenous antibiotics is a good strategy and may facilitate shorter durations of therapy for multi-drug-resistant pathogens. The particle size should be 1\u20135 mm for the antibiotic to be delivered to the lower airways and the lung parenchyma.However, lack of specific formulation, need of special aerosolization devices and suboptimal aerosol delivery may impose limitation on the usefulness. Currently vibrating mesh nebulizers can be used for delivery of nebulized antibiotics through the ventilator circuit. Currently approved inhaled antibiotics include colistin, and tobramycin.Aerosolized antibiotic therapy should be synchronized to be delivered with the inspiratory flow rather than continuous nebulization. The ventilator frequency should be low to give sufficient inspiratory time for drug delivery. Humidification may be important for the patient but its use may greatly reduce the nebulized drug delivery.\n\n",

Clinical criteria along with serum procalcitonin should be used for De-escalation rather than clinical criteria alone.If protected specimen brush (PSB) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture results are negative in a patient who is clinically improving and hemodynamically stable, antibiotic therapy can be discontinued.If the culture is negative for MRSA, linezolid or vancomycin can be safely stopped, and if the culture is positive for MRSA, other antibiotics can be stopped.If no organism is found, one should try to look for other causes of lung shadows, that is, atelectasis, collapse, aspiration, pulmonary embolism, and hemorrhage. It decreases unnecessary exposure to antibiotics and helps to reduce resistance to antibiotics.Change to oral therapy once the patient accepts orally and is hemodynamically stable.The initial antibiotics should be given intravenously with changeover to oral therapy in responsive patients with an intact gastrointestinal function. The organism should be sensitive to oral antibiotics.Fluoroquinolones and linezolid are equally bioavailable in either intravenous or oral preparations.All patients with VAP should receive antibiotics at least for 7 days. The clinical, radiological and laboratory improvement can suggest a longer need of antibiotic therapy. Nonfermenters like acinetobacter and pseudomonas should also be treated for 14 days.Antibiotic dosing should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.\n",
