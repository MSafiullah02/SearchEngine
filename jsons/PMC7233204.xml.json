Adapting patient care to the changing environment is critical to mitigating public health risks and often includes alterations to trainee-level curricula. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have released interim guidelines for healthcare institutions across the nation on strategies to cope with COVID-19 and minimize its risk to patients and clinicians.1 Within the field of radiation oncology, responses have largely been dictated by individual institutions although the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has released general guidelines.2 With a focus on resident training, we report our first-hand experience of how four major academic radiation oncology programs in Florida have instituted changes to address the COVID-19 pandemic and safely care for their vulnerable cancer patients. We also discuss the dilemma associated with residency training and evaluate the role of residents in the radiation oncology clinic setting.",

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, University of Florida, and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have each implemented significant changes to adapt to the new patient environment. While some details of each departmental change differ (Table 1\n), there are several common measures taken. All institutions have adopted a triaging system to categorize the risk associated with a patient\u2019s cancer and potentially delay either the start of radiation therapy (RT) or initial clinic consult. The risk associated with delaying RT is often mitigated using medical management with hormone therapy, chemotherapy, etc when clinically appropriate. All institutions have encouraged hypofractionation, transitioned at least some aspect of patient care to a telehealth format, moved all clinical and administrative meetings to a virtual media, and screen anyone who enters the hospital for their COVID-19 infection risk. Remote work is also strongly encouraged but the specific changes to department staffing vary. Lastly, the number of patient visitors is limited at each institution with some prohibiting any visitors.",

There are several common measures taken by the programs. Residents are now limited in their ability to have in-person patient contact and their time spent within the radiation oncology departments. Which in-person patient encounter residents are involved with varies by institution and sometimes, the attending physician. Remote work is strongly encouraged for all residents unless patient care duties dictate their presence within the departments. The clinical radiation oncology, physics, and radiation biology didactics courses are continuing at all institutions but through a virtual format. Any attending-lead teaching is conducted virtually when applicable (radiation contour and plan reviews, for example). Where residents may take their call from differs by institution, but inpatient consults are generally seen by the attending physicians only. All institutions have altered the timeline, format, or entirely cancelled residency-related activities including residency graduation ceremonies. Several institutions have developed redeployment strategies if additional clinicians are needed to help manage COVID-19 patients, but no residents have experienced redeployment to date. Residents are also provided with a variety of wellness resources to help manage the stressors associated with these changing times.",

            "text": "Radiation oncology residents are experiencing a period of uncertainty with unclear roles as providers and trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While radiation oncology is not a frontline specialty managing COVID-19 patients, the field cares for a vulnerable and at-risk population. As trainees, our in-person interaction with patients who may harbor COVID-19 unnecessarily places them and ourselves at risk. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) offsets this risk but during a time of PPE shortage, and since all residents require attending physician oversight, the educational value of each patient interaction should be thoughtfully evaluated. Nevertheless, a prolonged decrease in resident-patient interaction could adversely affect resident training and impact our ability to practice independently in the future. This dynamic creates a dilemma regarding the ideal approach to residency training in the current climate.",

            "text": "The residency programs described herein take several common measures to address this dilemma and we applaud their implementation. We advocate for continued resident involvement in all aspects of patient care when performed through a virtual format. If institutions or patient scenarios do not allow for this format, in-person resident involvement should be evaluated with respect to the educational value of the encounter. For example, in-person on-treatment visits (OTVs) and follow-ups that are \u201croutine\u201d and involve no toxicity management or re-evaluation should not necessitate in-person resident involvement. The highest educational priority should be placed on patients due to start radiation therapy and we encourage discussions between residents and their attendings regarding the value of hypofractionation for each case. Even if such cases occur in-person, the resident may be able to remotely prepare for the consult, formulate their treatment recommendation, and generate the treatment plan without unnecessarily placing themselves or the patient at risk. As such, the need for a resident to see an in-person consult should be limited to when the clinical encounter provides additional information that impacts the treatment plan. Regardless of the inherent educational value of the case, all clinical encounters that occur through a telehealth format should involve residents as the use of this new media itself provides valuable experience.",

All other physical examinations should be performed with proper PPE and only if they add value to clinical decision making. If possible, these should be performed at the time of CT simulation to consolidate the frequency of patient and provider exposure. This recommendation follows our general ideology of eliminating duplicate exposure and minimizing wasteful PPE use.",

The utilization of this virtual format allows for continued training of residents while protecting staff within the department. As such, we advocate for its use for all structured didactics, case reviews, mock exams, and treatment plan reviews. With the announcement of board examination delays, we emphasize continuing all curricula related to preparing residents for these exams without interruption. Additionally, to offset the anticipated reduction in patient volume and resident clinical encounters, we encourage more frequent virtual case sessions to hone our clinical acumen.",

            "text": "Given the uncertainties associated with this pandemic (e.g. the possibility for redeployment to the frontlines, the risks towards ourselves and loved ones, and anxiety related to the changing job market), resident wellness should be a deliberate discussion within departments. These changing factors may precipitate underlying anxiety and/or depression within the residents and feigning ignorance over their presence is not a viable solution. Even changes such as prolonged remote work may introduce feelings of isolation in a distinctly lonely environment; particularly for residents who moved to new cities for their training. Coupled with the cancellation or postponement of residency-related wellness activities or examinations, the stresses for residents may accumulate without having their typical healthy outlets. We strongly urge programs to perform routine check-ins on residents both on a one-to-one and group basis. We also encourage residents to reach out to their colleagues and loved ones for support. For residents experiencing redeployment, we have provided a list of resources to aid in the clinical care of COVID-19 patients (Table 3\n). This table also provides resources regarding crowd-sourced hypofractionation regimens, residency program changes, and protocols used to guide departmental changes during this pandemic.",

Radiation oncology resident schedules are typically dictated by the attendings with whom they work, and the COVID-19 pandemic introduces uncertainties that amplify this lack of control. We promote open communication amongst teams and advocate for residents to express their comfort level regarding in-person patient encounters. However, it is important to recognize the hierarchal difference that exist in the structure of medicine and acknowledge that a top-down approach is more impactful. We therefore ask for program directors and department chairs to consider the matters discussed in this article when implementing residency changes. These times are far from normal, but we must continue to work towards achieving normalcy where we can. We humbly thank our institutions for monitoring the unfolding events and implementing strategies to ensure the safety of their staff and our patients.",
