            "text": "Increasingly in paediatric intensive care, as in the adult sphere, the intensivist\u2019s focus is increasingly guided towards not only reducing mortality but also to ensuring that survival is morbidity-free. Baghurst et al. [1] reported on the applicability of sequential control charts for monitoring of the quality of paediatric intensive care using risk-adjusted probabilities of death estimated by the Paediatric Index of Mortality version 2 (PIM2). A total of 10,710 patient records submitted to the Australia and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care registry from 8 PICU\u2019s were used in the report. During the 2-year monitoring period the investigators demonstrated that their methodology was able to detect one \u2018alarm\u2019 for poor PICU performance and one \u2018alarm\u2019 for better than expected PICU performance. In their paper, the authors present a detailed description of sequential analysis methodologies and describe their potential prospective use as tools for monitoring the performance of intensive care units. They caution that \u2018alarms\u2019 for poor or excessively good performance are arbitrarily set and are not necessarily indicative of \u2018real\u2019 problems. Alarms should, however, act as triggers for investigation to ascertain whether the data is sound and if so whether true clinical over or underperformance exists. Numa et al. [2] undertook a study to determine whether outcomes were influenced by time of admission to an Australian tertiary paediatric intensive care unit without 24 h per day in-house intensivist cover. Evening, night and weekend cover by staff intensivists was provided mainly by telephone with discretionary return to hospital to support resident paediatric staff. The authors found that a lack of in-house intensivist was not associated with any increase in risk-adjusted mortality or increased length of stay. They attribute these findings to a combination of relatively experienced junior staff and the effectiveness of telephone backup and discretionary attendance from intensivists after hours. Two studies in 2008 looked at the quality of survival of children after undergoing intensive care. In a case-control study, Elison et al. [3] reported on a detailed neuropsychological follow-up of 16 children, with mean age 9.44 \u00b1 2.85 years, tested a mean of 4.8 \u00b1 1.4 months following hospital discharge. They detected the presence of impaired memory and attention in children following acute illness and links between memory anomalies and emotional/behavioural problems. These findings, if replicated in a larger study, are very important to children and their parents and teachers. Knoester et al. [4] also reported on early neurocognitive sequelae of intensive care but in addition reported information on physical outcomes. They determined that 69% of children had detectable physical sequelae 3 months after PICU discharge. Whilst 30% of sequelae were attributed to previously unknown illness, 39% were acquired of which 8% were related to complications of PICU procedures. Finally, in the area of patient safety and quality, Burmester et al. [5] reported on the apparent benefit of the introduction of a structured prescription education programme and standardised prescription template in a paediatric cardiac ICU. The total number of prescription errors fell from a baseline of 16.8% of prescriptions to 4.8% after the implementation of the measures and this was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the incidence of Adverse Drug Events. Weight-based variations in drug dosing are often quoted as a factor in the known high incidence of drug errors in paediatric practice. Disappointingly, tenfold miscalculations which are particularly common and dangerous in children if the decimal point is misplaced during calculations showed no improvement with the studied interventions. This report highlights the need for regular ongoing education in critical care units which typically have high prescription volumes and often see high turnover of staff, particularly \u2018junior\u2019 prescribers such as resident medical staff.",

            "text": "The high mortality of septic shock in children was confirmed in a paper from Wolfler et al. [6] who reported a prospective observational study across 15 Italian paediatric intensive care units conducted over a period of 1 year. During the study 2,741 children were admitted to the participating PICU\u2019s. The incidence of severe sepsis was 1.6% and that of septic shock 2.1%, with associated mortalities of 17.7 and 50.8%, respectively. In March 2008 the Journal published a landmark paper from de Oliveira et al. [7]. They studied children with septic shock who were resuscitated according to ACCM/PALS guidelines [8] with or without ScvO2 goal-directed therapy. In this randomised controlled trial, there was a significant difference in mortality rate with use of ACCM/PALS haemodynamic support guidelines for septic shock between patients with or without ScvO2 guided therapy. Patients who received therapies directed to the goal of ScvO2 > 70% were given more fluid, red blood cells and inotropic support after the initial resuscitation, with a resulting 3.3-fold reduction in mortality. This study supports the incorporation goal-directed therapy using the endpoint of a ScvO2 \u2265 70% within ACCM/PALS guidelines the use of which provided a significant beneficial impact on the outcome of children and adolescents with septic shock in this study. Recently the use of vasopressin and vasopressin analogues, potent vasoconstrictors, has been reported in the management of vasodilatory shock in children. Jerath reported a retrospective study of the use of vasopressin in a series of 157 children in a multidisciplinary PICU. Haemodynamics appear to have been favourably influenced, but the authors noted adverse effects on renal function and lower platelet counts associated with vasopressin use. Yildizdas et al. [9] performed a randomised non-blinded comparison of the use of the vasopressin analogue terlipressin in a group of 58 children with refractory septic shock. Although terlipressin had no beneficial effect on mortality rate in this study, its use was associated with increased mean arterial pressure, improved oxygenation, decreased length of stay in the PICU and had a beneficial effect on survival time among nonsurvivors. Despite these interesting early reports, the place of vasopressin and its analogues in the management of shock states in children is not yet established. Until blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled studies are conducted in children with septic shock and in other shock states which compare the use of vasopressin-like drugs to standard treatments such as noradrenaline, their use should be considered only a rescue therapy of last resort.",

In this article, Hauser and coll [10] reviewed the literature on intensive care of paediatric intestinal transplantation as well as their own experience. This article covers the following areas: the indications for intestinal transplantation, the management of critically ill children awaiting intestinal transplantation, the operative procedure, the post-operative management. This last area deals with the intestinal graft, the liver graft, the cardiovascular, respiratory and renal support, the electrolyte and haematologic management, the pain and infection control, the rejection and other alterations in graft function, the nutritional support, the problems of high stomal output, the immunosuppressive treatment, the outcomes and the upcoming challenges. The authors concluded that transplant teams accept patients with higher morbidity and higher risks for complications and indicate that many of these patients would benefit from earlier referral for transplant evaluation before severe complications develop.",

Lamas et al. [11] investigated the utility of the bispectral index (BIS), auditory-evoked responses (AEP) and Ramsay and COMFORT clinical scales in the assessment of sedation in critically ill children. Simultaneous recordings were obtained. In children in whom neuromuscular blockade was not being used, correlation between the four methods was moderate or good. However, only BIS and AEP were found to be potentially reliable in those children who were both sedated and subject to neuromuscular blockade. The authors concluded that their results support the finding that the clinical scales do not evaluate the level of sedation accurately in critically ill children with neuromuscular relaxation, leading to a higher risk of over or under-sedation. They suggest that in these children, BIS and the AEP index methods may provide a better assessment of the level of sedation. However, they caution that lack of correlation between these two methods in children with neuromuscular relaxation and the absence of a reference method to evaluate sedation in the relaxed patient means that their results must be interpreted carefully. Further studies are needed.",

Their proposed pRIFLE criteria are based on a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance (eCCL),and urine output is based on body weight. Pl\u00f6tz et al. [13] independently evaluated the pRIFLE criteria in a cohort of 103 children in a European PICU. Sixty children (58%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI) according to pRIFLE criteria of whom six required renal replacement therapy. The authors conclude that pRIFLE criteria may guide the early identification of patients at risk of AKI and therefore guide early initiation of therapy, with potential to avoid progress from \u2018risk\u2019 to injury\u2019. Hoover and colleagues reported a series of 26 children on ECMO for respiratory failure who received CVVH for >24 h and compared these to ECMO/non-CVVH case-matched control children. Significant findings included a faster time to desired caloric intake and reduced furosemide use in CVVH treated children. Although no obvious survival benefit related to use of CVVH was demonstrated, the association of CVVH on ECMO with improved fluid balance and nutritional management was compelling.",

Standardised volume challenges were given to 26 children with preserved ventricular function. Aortic blood flow was analysed by transthoracic pulsed Doppler. Whilst a positive correlation was found between \u0394 V peak Ao and volume expansion-induced gain in stroke volume, measurements of \u0394 SAP pressure and \u0394 PP were of little value in predicting responses to fluid augmentation in ventilated children. In a preliminary study, Knirsch et al. [15] compared the measurement of cardiac output using the Ultrasound Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) with pulmonary artery catheter-derived thermodilution cardiac output in a group of 24 children undergoing cardiac catheterization. The main finding was that cardiac output measured with USCOM did not reliably represent absolute values measured by pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution, with a mean percentage error higher than 30%. The limitations of transthoracic pulsed Doppler cardiac output measurement in comparison to cardiac output measurement by the thermodilution technique has been recognized [16]. A number of user-dependent technical factors have been shown to influence ultrasound-derived measurements in other studies in a variety of situations. In addition, possible inaccuracy in algorithm-derived aortic valve diameter used in calculation for cardiac output from flow can introduce systematic error. Many of these limitations are negated if serial measurements are used to derive trends in aortic flow rather algorithm-derived \u2018absolute\u2019 cardiac outputs. Frey et al. [17] brought clarity to the interpretation of aspects of the photoplethysmographic wave which is displayed by most pulse oximeters. They demonstrate that it may be used to derive additional haemodynamic information in some selected situations when, for instance, arterial blood pressure monitoring is not available. The advantages of this method are its widespread use, non-invasiveness and continuity. The authors suggest that haemodynamic deterioration, whether suddenly occurring or slowly evolving over time, may be detected by this method. There is only minimal reference to photoplethysmography monitoring in the paediatric literature.",

            "text": "Three studies published in 2008 relate to aspects of the care of children undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Tissi\u00e8res et al. [18] described the use of the biomarker n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (N-proBNP) and troponin I in 20 children following valvular surgery. Their results demonstrated that N-proBNP was superior to troponin I in reflecting clinical and echocardiographic postoperative recovery. Furthermore the authors suggest that preoperative N-proBNP reflected postoperative myocardial functional capacity, thus potentially helping in the early identification of patients who are at risk of chronic cardiac dysfunction. Another biomarker, plasma angiopoetin-2 (Angpt-2), a vascular growth factor, was found by Giuliano et al. [19] to independently predict cardiac ICU length of stay in a series of 48 children palliative or corrective cardiac surgery. The angiopoietins are a family of vascular growth factors that are necessary for both developmental and pathological angiogenesis. ANGPT-2 promotes increased vascular permeability and inflammation and has been shown to be increased in adults with congestive heart failure and the acute coronary syndrome. The authors conclude that ANGPT-2 appears to be an important biomarker of adverse outcome following CPB. Further studies pertaining to the role of angpt-2 in the pathophysiology of capillary leak syndrome following CPB are warranted. At a more practical level, the study reported by Ross-Russell et al. [20] is a large prospective report of the measurement of phrenic nerve latency in 310 children before and after cardiac surgery. Phrenic nerve injury being a relatively common and clinically important complication of cardiothoracic surgery). The authors ascertained an incidence of phrenic nerve injury associated with surgery of 20%. Injury was associated with an increased duration of postoperative ventilation (20 vs. 96 h, P < 0.001). Of particular interest in this report is medium term follow-up which shows that one-third children recovered function within 1 months and a further one-third within 3 months.",

            "text": "Two papers recently published in the Journal shed further light on the mechanisms of paediatric respiratory disease. A paper by Plunkett et al. [21] addressed the question of whether the D allele of the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with increased susceptibility to acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in critically ill children. Previous reports have linked the D allele of the ACE gene to susceptibity for ARDS in critically ill adults and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in pre-term infants. In a single centre prospective study, AHRF developed in 13.9% of 216 critically ill children. There was no significant difference in the frequency of the D allele between patient groups with and without AHRF. The authors suggest that this may suggest differences in the pathogenesis of paediatric AHRF and adult ARDS. Phospholipases A2 is an enzyme widely distributed in the body and was the focus of a report from De Luca et al. [22]. The enzyme is primarily involved in the turnover of membrane phospholipids and lipid digestion. In addition phospholipase A2 is involved in inflammation pathways through the formation of eicosanoids and other inflammatory mediators. In the lungs the secretory form of the enzyme (sPLA2) is produced mainly by alveolar macrophages and secreted into the alveoli. sPLA2 has been shown to be involved in lung inflammation and surfactant degradation and it may play a role for sPLA2 in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). De Luca et al. provide evidence that sPLA2 is present in high concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from neonates with pneumonia and hyaline membrane disease. In this study, sPLA2 levels correlated negatively with dynamic compliance and positively with indices of poorer oxygenation. It appears therefore that the enzyme plays a role in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in neonates.",

            "text": "Respiratory disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for almost 10% of admissions to PICU\u2019s [23]. RSV disease is characterised by inflammation of the small airways with raised airways resistance, air-trapping and pulmonary consolidation, disproportionately effects young infants due primarily to their poor respiratory muscle reserve. ICM recently published three papers describing different ventilatory strategies for infants with RSV disease. Javouhey et al. [24] used non-invasive ventilation as their primary form of respiratory support in 27 infants. They applied continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 5\u201310 cm H2O with additional bi-level positive pressure ventilation of 12\u201320 cm H2O as required. Compared to an immediately prior historical cohort of infants with the disease, the intubation rate was significantly lower (52 vs. 89% P < 0.01). Berner and colleagues [25] adopted a different strategy, successfully using high frequency oscillatory ventilation whilst allowing spontaneous breathing in a group of 9 infants with RSV. These two strategies are essentially delivering physiologically similar therapy, maintaining spontaneous ventilation and relying on CPAP to maintain lung volume and reduce the work of breathing. The suggestion that CPAP is clinically effective in RSV bronchiolitis possibly through reduced work of breathing in babies with RSV bronchiolitis was first made by Beasley and Jones [26] in 1981. Whilst Thia et al. [27] have recently confirmed the utility of nasal CPAP in infants with RSV bronchiolitis, showing that they have lower PaCO2 values, Cambonie et al. [28] have finally shown in an elegant study that the use of nasal CPAP rapidly unloads the respiratory muscles, reducing the work of breathing, in young infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis. Argent et al. [29] addressed similar issues in two related papers investigating the mechanics of breathing in children with severe croup and the effect of nebulization of epinephrine on measures of airway obstruction [30]. Respiratory mechanics were studies in 20 infants with severe croup. Patients were found to maintain minute ventilation by means of large increases in mean intrathoracic pressure required to overcome inspiratory flow limitation. Nebulised epinephrine was found to result in short-lived improvement in some but not all patients with croup. Both inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance fell in patients responding to nebulised epinephrine. Oesophageal pressures in both studies were measured via a feeding tube and were found to be satisfactory for quantification of the acute response to nebulised epinephrine whereas flow measurements were unhelpful.",

            "text": "Finally two clinical reports address areas of the management of acute respiratory failure in children where significant differences from adult practice are evident. Pathan et al. [31] reported a series of 124 children categorised as receiving \u2018paediatric extra-corporeal life support\u2019 in a single institution from the inception of their ECLS programme in July 1992 until December 2005. Clinical selection criteria operated during the study were those of severe respiratory failure failing to respond to conventional management and in whom recovery was believed to be reasonably possible. Survival to hospital discharge was 62 with 59% surviving to 1 year. Severity of pulmonary dysfunction pre-ECMO and the presence of shock predicted higher risk of mortality. Kneyber et al. [32] raise the important question of whether we know the true incidence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome in children, or whether it is under-recognised. They retrospectively reviewed 533 mechanically ventilated children admitted to two regional Dutch paediatric ICU\u2019s. Chest radiographs were screened for the presence of bilateral infiltrates, PaO2/FiO2 ratios calculated and left ventricular dysfunction ruled out by echocardiography. Forty-one (7.7%) of children met criteria for ARDS giving a population-based incidence of ARDS of 2.2 per 100,000 per year. The incidence of paediatric ARDS is low compared to adults, but the authors suggest that many cases of ARDS are categorised by their underlying diseases such as viral infections, leading to significant under-reporting of ARDS. This may be particularly important when planning randomised \u2013controlled trials, as significant underestimation of the effected population could lead to erroneous trial designs or abandonment of trials at the planning stage due to perceived difficulty in recruiting subjects in a timely and cost-effective manner. Bachmann et al. [33] investigated the level of adoption of paediatric ventilation technologies from the participants at two international conferences. The authors used the approach of Rogers\u2019 which addresses both differences among individuals and characteristics of the innovation [34]. The authors concluded that whilst evidence of outcomes is the most relevant factor for assessment of potentially beneficial technologies, other factors that encourage adoption of mediocre technologies, or that retard adoption of potentially beneficial technologies, must be understood and acknowledged.",

Universal requirements for ethical research are on one hand the respect of subject\u2019s autonomy and on the other the protection against harm (the risk-benefit ratio). Respect of autonomy for a child under 18 implies that investigators, whenever possible, seek his\u2013her assent, besides the parental authorization. Protection is achieved via a drastic limitation of the risks children can be exposed during a trial: in the US, the threshold is a \u201cminimal risk\u201d for healthy children and a \u201cminor increase over minimal risk\u201d for diseased ones. Then, Dr Truog proposes a three-step approach of evaluation of paediatric research protocols. The basic concept here is the so-called \u201ccomponent analysis\u201d: the research protocol has to be broken in several components, those part of standard care and those which are necessary for research, in addition to care. Each of these components are separately analysed in terms of risk/benefit balance. However, appreciation of \u201cminimal risk\u201d is always debatable, and it is the essential role of the Research Ethics Committee (RECs, or IRBs in the US) to define it on a case to case basis.",

They convincingly show that most of the controversies which followed the publication of some of them stemmed from the inappropriate design of control groups. A well designed control group has two main functions: the first one is to protect the patients enrolled in the trial, and the second is to guarantee the external validity of the conclusions of the research. If the new therapy is to replace the existing standard, it has to have been tested against this standard. Authors\u2019 recommendations are that a control group should not be historical, needs to represent current care and should be enrolled along with the new treatment group. Of course, in all large trials involving severely ill patients, a DSMB will monitor safety by comparing the intervention group to this control group. Special difficulties are commonplace in critical care research: patients populations are frequently heterogeneous, syndromes are dealt with, instead of diseases (septic shock, ARDS.), many treatments are delivered with titration: Vt, PEEP, catecholamines, blood transfusion, making the design of a control group extraordinary arduous (one size does no fit all.).",

This study has demonstrated a large gradient from Northern to Southern regions in Europe as to the end of life decisions in ICUs. It was certainly tempting to see whether physician\u2019s values could explain these discrepancies. Clearly, the lesser degree of end of life decisions in the South corresponds to more paternalistic views, as expressed by a more frequently cited \u201cunresponsiveness to therapy\u201d, a lesser degree of documentation of their decisions and also a lesser consideration for patients\u2019 \u201cbest interest\u201d. However, all investigators, irrespectively of their location, gave a low priority to patient or family request. The authors conclude that \u201c.there is room (in Europe) for greater engagement with patients and their families to promote patient autonomy in the end of life decision-making process\u201d!",

They interviewed 149 patients who required >36 h of mechanical ventilation 2 months after ICU discharge. Eighty patients were also interviewed at 6 months. ICU recall was greater for events occurring at the end of critical illness; however, 18% of subjects had amnesia for the entire ICU course. Posttraumatic stress disorder prevalence was 17% at 2 months and 15% at 6 months. Recall of a delirious memory during critical illness was associated with more severe posttraumatic stress symptoms. Neither ICU recall nor posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with the intensity of sedative administration during mechanical ventilation. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were lowest in patients either the most awake during mechanical ventilation or the least awake. In a prospective, randomised, single-blinded, controlled study, R\u00f6hm et al. [63] compared sevoflurane and propofol in terms of recovery times from sedation. A total of 70 patients after elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery received either sevoflurane (n = 35) or propofol (n = 35) for short-term postoperative sedation in the ICU. Mean extubation times from termination of sedation (the primary outcome) were significantly shorter with sevoflurane than with propofol (22 vs. 151 min). The length of ICU stay was comparable in both groups, but hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the sevoflurane group. Costs for sedation per patient were similar in both groups. Suchyta et al. [64] compared mortality and discharge disposition in critically ill patients with and without drug or alcohol dependence and patients with and without psychiatric disorders. They found that patients with drug or alcohol dependence were at higher risk for ICU admission compared to the general population. However, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was significantly lower than in the general population. Drug or alcohol dependence predicted shorter hospital length of stay. In a retrospective review of patient records over 2 years in 20 French city hospitals Lapostolle et al. [65] evaluated 838 patients with an elevated serum digitalis concentration (digoxin > 1.95 ng/ml or digitoxin > 23 ng/ml), following chronic or acute exposure. Of these, 67 (8%) had received antidotal therapy with Fab fragments. Five independent factors were associated with the use of antidotal therapy: acute overdose (OR 15.74), Fab fragment availability in the hospital (11.06), serum potassium (1.81), and heart rate (0.96). Mortality was significantly lower in Fab-treated (6%, 4/67) than untreated patients (15%, 117/770). The authors concluded that antidotal therapy is underused in patients with an elevated digitalis concentration and the use of identical criteria for antidotal treatment after acute and chronic poisoning should help optimize outcomes.",

In the past decade, the use of CO gas in pre-clinical experimental models of disease has produced some remarkable data indicating that its therapeutic delivery to mammals could alleviate inflammatory processes and cardiovascular disorders. However, the inherent toxic nature of CO cannot be ignored, knowing that inhalation of uncontrolled amounts of this gas can ultimately lead to serious systemic complications and neuronal derangements. From a clinical perspective, a key question is whether a safe and therapeutically effective threshold of CO can be reached locally in organs and tissues without delivering potentially toxic amounts through the lung. The advent of CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), a group of compounds capable of carrying and liberating controlled quantities of CO in cellular systems, could be a plausible alternative in the attempt to overcome the limitations of CO gas. Although in its infancy and far from being used for clinical applications, the CO-RMs technology is supported by very encouraging biological results.",
