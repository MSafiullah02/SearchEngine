Rose did not dismiss individual-level approaches, but rather emphasized that their main benefit is on treating higher-risk individuals in whom the benefits outweigh the risks.8 On the other hand, from a population standpoint, the high-risk approach is akin to famine relief, which feeds the hungry in the short term but does not tackle the underlying causes, which persist: \u201csuccess is only palliative and temporary\u201d.8\n",

The association between poverty and these outcomes occurs through a variety of pathways and ultimately yields a markedly reduced quality of life and life expectancy.

Conversely, cardiovascular disease has well-established proximal risk factors and upwards determinants, most of which are addressable.
