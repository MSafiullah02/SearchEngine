Tests must include fail-safe controls that affirmatively report the presence of intact RNA and demonstrate success of all steps of the assay. A result of \"no virus signal\" is insufficient for clinical interpretation: controls must also say \"The reaction worked as intended and would have found virus if present.\" Unfortunately, a widely used test specified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incorporates a control that does not perform as intended and claimed. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 with this assay requires both intact RNA and successful reverse transcription. The CDC-specified control does not require either of these, due to its inability to differentiate human genomic DNA from reverse-transcribed RNA. Patient DNA is copurified from nasopharyngeal swabs during clinically-approved RNA extraction and is sufficient to return an \"extraction control success\" signal using the CDC design. As such, this assay fails-unsafe: truly positive patient samples return a false-negative result of \"no virus detected, control succeeded\" following any of several readily-encountered mishaps. This problem affects tens-ofmillions of patients worth of shipped assays, but many of these flawed reagents have not yet been used. There is an opportunity to improve this important diagnostic tool. As demonstrated here, a re-designed transcript-specific control correctly monitors sample collection, extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR detection. This approach can be rapidly implemented and will help reduce truly positive patients from being incorrectly given the all-clear. One Sentence Summary:",

Samples had been processed using either solid phase extraction (Qiagen) or low pH organic extraction (Trizol). Both methods are permitted under current Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for RNA isolation. In reality, both methods co-purify significant amounts of DNA (5). All clinical samples tested generated unambiguous extraction control positive signals in the absence of reverse transcription, a reaction context that could not have detected virus an RNA virus ( Fig. 2A) Single-digit copies of genomic DNA are sufficient to generate a positive control signal using the CDC-designed assay. Driven by concern about the control probe signals observed in PCR-only analysis, I determined the quantity of genomic DNA required to generate an assay-positive control signal.

Horizontal dashed lines reflect software-generated Ct thresholds. Sample preparation Fully de-identified clinical \"RNA\" (more properly, total nucleic acid) specimens, generated in excess during testing of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR-positive patients, were provided by the Stony Brook Hospital Biobank. Nucleic acids had been previously purified from polyester-tipped nasopharyngeal swabs desorbed in viral transport media (VTM) and processed in a CLIA high complexity pathology laboratory. Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted from 160\u00b5l VTM using Qiagen QiaAMP DSP Viral Mini spin columns processed on a Qiacube automation system as per vendor instructions (Qiagen, BV) or from 200\u00b5l VTM using manual Trizol-mediated organic extraction (Life Technologies) followed by alcohol precipitation (5). Samples were eluted in 50\u00b5l of RNase-free water supplemented with 0.04% NaN3 (Qiagen) or resuspended in RNase-free water (Trizol) and stored at -80C until use. Commercial pooled RNA (Quantigene Human Reference, QS0639, Life Technologies) and pooled human male DNA (G3041, Promega and 4312660, Life Technologies) were used to generate calibration curves and serve as reaction controls. DNA samples were diluted in nuclease free water supplemented with 0.01% Tween-20, RNA samples were diluted in nuclease-free water. Low binding filter tips were used for all liquid handling.",

This email is being presented in full and unedited. It is internally ambiguous. The first paragraph correctly notes that my email 5 reflected concerns about false negative potential. This is contradicted in the second paragraph as \"false-positive results\", which I hope to be a typo by the CDC. Given the importance of this communication in the context of CDC's response, I am including a contact-info redacted version of this email in spite of the \"do not distribute\" message. No patient identifying information is present, and this represents US government work product (from the CDC) and that of a NY state, federally grant funded employee (the recipient). Dear Adam Rosebrock, Our apologies for the delayed response to your email. As you can imagine we are currently experiencing a high volume of inquiries, but patient care is a top priority and we want to thank you for reaching out to us about your concerns for the 2019-nCov assay and the potential for false negatives.",

In addition, CDC has not received feedback that the CDC EUA COVID-19 assay produces false-positive results when used according to the IFU.",

I believe we can all agree that in this pandemic it is better to err on the side of caution. I hope this response answers some of your concerns, and have a wonderful day!
