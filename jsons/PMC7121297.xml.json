            "text": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical four-stranded nucleic acid structures formed in guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences (Fig. 1). They have emerged as one of the most exciting nucleic acid secondary structures. DNA is widely recognized as a double-helical structure essential in genetic information storage. Results from the ENCODE project [1] indicate that only ~3% of the human genome is expressed in protein and that RNA and DNA may form noncanonical secondary structures that are functionally important. G-quadruplexes are one such example which have gained considerable attention for their formation and regulatory roles in biologically significant regions. G-quadruplexes are found to be involved in a number of critical cellular processes, including gene transcription, translation, DNA replication, and genomic stability. G-quadruplexes can readily form under physiologically relevant conditions and are globularly folded structures. Many proteins have been identified to interact with G-quadruplex DNA or RNA, including G-quadruplex-stabilizing or destabilizing/unfolding proteins (see reviews: [2\u20136]). As such, G-quadruplexes have emerged as a new class of molecular targets for drug development. In addition, there is considerable interest in the use of G-quadruplexes for biomaterials [7, 8], biosensors [9, 10], and biocatalysts [11].",

The core structure of a G-quadruplex consists of stacked guanine-tetrads (G-tetrads), a square planar platform of four guanine bases that are held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1a). G-quadruplex structures require cations, particularly K+ or Na+, to stabilize stacked G-tetrads by coordinating with tetrad-guanine O6 atoms [14\u201316]. The tetrad-guanines can adopt anti or syn glycosidic conformation; tetrad-guanines from G-strands with the same direction, i.e., parallel strands, adopt the same glycosidic conformation, whereas those from G-strands with the opposite direction, i.e., antiparallel strands, adopt different glycosidic conformations [17].",

            "text": "G-quadruplexes can be intramolecular (monomeric) or intermolecular (multimeric), which are formed with one or more than one nucleic acid molecules, respectively. Tetramolecular G-quadruplexes (Fig. 1b) are usually parallel-stranded with tetrad guanines adopting anti glycosidic conformation. Most biologically relevant G-quadruplexes are intramolecular G-quadruplexes, with three-tetrad cores being the most common (Fig. 1c). In contrast to tetramolecular structures, intramolecular G-quadruplexes form quickly and exhibit great conformational diversity, such as in folding topology, loop conformation, and capping structures. Based on G-strand directionality, a G-quadruplex can be parallel with all four G-strands in the same direction, hybrid/mixed with both parallel and antiparallel strands, or antiparallel with all adjacent G-strands antiparallel to each other. G-strands in intramolecular G-quadruplexes are connected by different types of loops, such as propeller for connecting parallel strands, lateral for connecting adjacent antiparallel strands, and diagonal for connecting antiparallel strands across the G-tetrad core. Not only can different sequences adopt distinct topologies, but a given sequence can also fold into different conformations, as in the case of the human telomeric DNA, or form multiple structures, as in the case of human gene promoter sequences [18]. While a number of principles of G-quadruplex folding have been recognized, a G-quadruplex conformation is difficult to predict and requires experimental structure determination.",

            "text": "The first biologically relevant G-quadruplex was observed in telomeric DNA. Telomeres are specific DNA\u2013protein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes, providing protection against gene erosion from cell divisions, chromosomal nonhomologous end-joinings, and nuclease attacks [19\u201321]. Telomeric G-quadruplexes were first reported as novel intramolecular structures containing guanine\u2013guanine base-pairs in single-stranded telomeric sequences of several organisms [22], and as guanine-tetrads between hairpin loops of the Tetrahymena telomeric DNA [23]. The importance of monovalent cations in the stabilization of G-quadruplex structures was revealed by Williamson, Cech in their monovalent cation-induced square-planar G-quartet model using the Oxytricha and Tetrahymena telomeric DNA [14]. Human telomeres consist of tandem repeats of the hexanucleotide d (TTAGGG)n 5\u201310 kb in length, which terminate in a single-stranded 3\u2032-overhang of 35\u2013600 bases [24]. Telomeres of cancer cells do not shorten upon replication, mainly due to the activation of a reverse transcriptase, telomerase, that extends the telomeric sequence at the chromosome ends [25]. Telomerase is activated in 80\u201385% of human cancer cells to maintain telomere length and malignant phenotype [25\u201327]. The G-quadruplex formation can inhibit the activity of telomerase [28], making it an attractive target for cancer therapeutic intervention. In addition to the formation at the telomere end, which most likely involves intramolecular G-quadruplex structures, intermolecular G-quadruplex formation may also be involved in the T-loop invasion complex [29, 30]. Recently, telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) G-quadruplex was identified and found to inhibit telomerase [31, 32].",

The hybrid-type structures can effectively form packed multimers at the telomere ends [33, 45]. Although different human telomeric G-quadruplexes appear to have small energy differences relative to each other, interconversion between them is kinetically slow, indicating a high-energy intermediate (s) [33, 41, 46\u201348]. The structure polymorphism appears to be an intrinsic property of the highly conserved telomeric sequence in higher eukaryotes, particularly the TTA loop sequence [49].

The first experiments that suggested the existence of unusual forms of DNA associated with runs of guanines in gene promoters were reported in 1982 for the chicken \u03b2-globulin gene based upon the nuclease hypersensitivity of promoter elements [55\u201357]. Since then, the occurrence of these elements in the human gene promoters has been reported, including in those of insulin [58], c-MYC [54, 59], VEGF [60, 61], HIF-1\u03b1 [62], BCL-2 [63\u201365], MtCK [66], K-RAS [67, 68], c-KIT [69, 70], RET [71], PDGF-A [72], c-MYB [73], hTERT [74], and PDGF-R\u03b2 [75, 76], in addition to mouse \u03b17 integrin [77]. The potential occurrence of DNA G-quadruplexes has been discovered in the promoter regions of human genes involved in growth and proliferation [53, 78, 79]; these genes all contain G-rich/C-rich tracts in the proximal regions of promoters and are mostly TATA-less. In addition, the potential for quadruplex formation is higher within oncogenes as compared to tumor suppressor genes [80]. Computational analyses showed significant enrichment of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the promoter regions of human genes near transcription start sites (TSS) [81]. The driving force of the formation of promoter G-quadruplexes appears to be the transcription-induced dynamic negative superhelicity [82\u201385]. The c-MYC gene promoter is the most extensively studied system for the promoter G-quadruplex [54, 86]. A highly conserved G-rich nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 in the proximal region of the c-MYC promoter controls 80\u201390% of the transcriptional activity regardless of whether the P1 or P2 promoter is used [87\u201390]. This element in the c-MYC promoter is highly dynamic in its conformation [91], and can form G-quadruplex structures, which function as a transcriptional silencer [54, 59].",

            "text": "In contrast to the repeating tandems in the telomeric sequence, the promoter G-quadruplex-forming sequences are each unique in their number and length of G-tracts and intervening bases. The promoter G-rich sequences often contain more than four G-tracts with unequal numbers of guanines and can form multiple G-quadruplexes through utilizing varying combinations of G-tracts or different loop isomers through utilizing varying guanines on one G-tract [18]. Parallel structures are common to the promoter G-quadruplexes, usually with a three-tetrad core. Structural studies showed that each promoter G-quadruplex adopts unique capping and loop structures determined by its specific sequence, such as c-MYC [92\u201395], BCL-2 [63, 65, 96, 97], KRAS [98], c-KIT [99\u2013101], VEGF [102], and PDGFR-\u03b2 [103, 104]. A notable feature in the promoter G-quadruplexes is the prevalence of the G3NG3 motif, a robust parallel-stranded structural motif with a 1-nt propeller loop. This motif was first observed in the major G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-MYC promoter, which showed that the 1-nt propeller loop conformation is highly favored [94]. By having two such motifs, parallel promoter G-quadruplexes can have a long and variable middle loop [65, 97, 105]. In addition, parallel G-quadruplexes exist in variant forms, such as with broken-strand [99, 103], end-insertion [104], or even with an additional hairpin loop conformations [65, 74]. Furthermore, certain promoter sequences can form multiple G-quadruplexes on one overlapping region or on separate regions. For example, the BCL-2 proximal promoter contains two G-quadruplex-forming regions that are separated by 13 nt (Pu39 and P1G4), with two competing G4s, i.e., a hybrid structure [63, 96] and a parallel structure [97], formed in Pu39, and two equilibrating parallel G4s formed in P1G4 [65]. Similar phenomenon was observed in the promoters of KRAS [67, 68, 106\u2013108], c-KIT [69, 70, 99\u2013101], PDGFR-\u03b2 [75, 76, 103, 104], and hTERT [74, 109\u2013111]. The variations in promoter G-quadruplexes give rise to different overall structure properties that could be specifically recognized by proteins or small-molecule ligands for transcriptional regulation. Moreover, inherent polymorphism and equilibrium between different conformations may provide an additional layer of transcriptional modulation.",

In addition, G-quadruplexes have been found to form in RNA. G-quadruplexes formed in 5\u2032-UTR have been shown to inhibit translation [129, 130], such as NRAS [131], Zic-1 [132], TRF2 [133], Yin Yang 1 [134], or in internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) to initiate cap-independent translation, such as VEGF [135]. In addition, G-quadruplexes are found in 3\u2032-UTRs [136\u2013138] as well as in RNA introns to regulate the alternative splicing, such as TP53 [139] and Bcl-XL [140].",

Particularly, G-quadruplexes are found in genomes of human pathogens [144]. Many examples of G-quadruplexes were identified in viruses [145, 146], including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [147\u2013150], multiple species of herpes virus [151\u2013155], human papillomavirus (HPV) [156], hepatitis C [157], Zika [158], Ebola [159], and a G-quadruplex-binding protein was found in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [160]. In bacteria, G-quadruplexes are found in Escherichia coli [161], Neisseria gonorrhoeae [162], Neisseria meningitidis [163], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [164], and Deinococcus radiodurans [165]. G-quadruplexes were also found in ciliates [14], malaria parasites [166, 167], and yeasts [168, 169]. Notably, helicases that resolve G-quadruplex structures, such as RecQ [170, 171] and Pif1 [142] families, were found in both nonhuman and human systems. Most recently, the presence of G-quadruplexes in plant genomes has also emerged [172].",

            "text": "There has been significant progress in the detection of G-quadruplexes structures in vivo [173]. The first direct evidence of the in vivo existence of G-quadruplexes was established by using G-quadruplex-specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an antibody to detect G-quadruplexes formed at telomeres in macronuclei of the ciliate Stylonychia lemnae, which was shown to be cell cycle-dependent [174] and controlled by telomere end-binding proteins TEBP\u03b1 and TEBP\u03b2 phosphorylation [175]. More recently, using a G-quadruplex-specific antibodies BG4 (scFv) [176] and 1H6 (monoclonal antibody) [177], G-quadruplex structures were visualized in human cells at both telomeric and non-telomeric sites on chromosomes, and G4-loci number increased after exposure of live cells to G-quadruplex ligands [176] or in the absence of FANCJ, a G-quadruplex DNA-specific helicase [177]. Using BG4 to map endogenous G-quadruplex structures by G4 ChIP-seq in human cells, ~10,000 endogenous G-quadruplex structures were detected in immortalized precancerous HaCaT cells, 10 times higher than in normal human NHEK cells [178]. G-quadruplex structures were found to be enriched in nucleosome-depleted regulatory regions including the promoters, such as c-MYC, and 5\u2032 UTRs, of highly transcribed genes. The detected G-quadruplexes in cells account for less than 1% of the genomic G4-sites identified by G4-seq [179] or predicted by G4 algorithms [81], suggesting the in vivo formation of G-quadruplex is highly context-dependent. In addition, the endogenous potential G4 sites were detected in live human cells by chemical footprinting combined with high-throughput sequencing and were found to enrich in regions involving chromatin reorganization and gene transcription [180]. G-quadruplex formation in vivo was also detected by small molecules probes, such as the radiolabeled G-quadruplex-ligands 360A [181], and fluorescent G-quadruplex-ligands BMVC [182, 183] and DAOTA-M2 [184].",

            "text": "Recognition of the biological significance of G-quadruplexes has promoted research and development of G-quadruplex-interactive small molecule ligands (G4-ligands). The identification of genomic G-quadruplex structures in regions of functional importance, such as human telomeres and oncogene promoters, has created the opportunity to selectively target these globular DNA structures for cancer-specific drug development [17, 185\u2013190]. The therapeutic possibilities of targeting telomeric G-quadruplexes to inhibit telomerase were first reported in 1997 [191] and have been actively pursued [185\u2013188]. G-quadruplex-ligands were also shown to inhibit the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway which maintains telomere stability in a telomerase-independent manner in ~15% of cancer cells [192\u2013195]. The discovery of the perylene derivative PIPER to inhibit helicase Sgs1-mediated G-quadruplex unfolding suggested the existence of a broader mechanism for G-quadruplex-ligands [196]. In 2002, a small molecule that stabilizes the G-quadruplex formed in the c-MYC promoter was shown to inhibit c-MYC expression, suggesting therapeutic opportunity of targeting promoter G-quadruplexes for transcriptional modulation [54, 197]. Different groups of compounds, such as quindolines and ellipticines, were reported to suppress c-MYC transcription by stabilization of the c-MYC promoter G-quadruplex [198\u2013201]. Subsequently, transcriptional repression of other oncogenes was shown by compounds stabilizing promoter G-quadruplexes, such as c-KIT [202], BCL-2 [203], KRAS [204\u2013206]. More recently, G-quadruplex-stabilizing compounds were shown to cause DNA damage and genomic instability and exhibit synergistic effect with inhibitors or deficiency of DNA-repair mechanisms [207\u2013211]. Specifically, G-quadruplex-stabilizing compounds were shown to induce selective lethality in BRCA-deficient cancers by targeting the inherent DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair deficiency [212, 213].",

            "text": "A G-quadruplex targeting drug, Quarfloxin (CX-3543) [115], based on the fluoroquinolone compounds developed by Laurence Hurley [214, 215] showed excellent in vivo activity in various solid tumors and had reached Phase II clinical trials. Its second-generation compound, CX-5461, is currently in clinical trials for BRCA1/2 deficient tumors (Canadian trial, NCT02719977) [213]. Diverse families of other small molecule compounds that interact with G-quadruplexes were developed and studied. For example, TMPyP4, a tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin, is a structure-based designed compound that exhibits significant selectivity for quadruplex DNA over duplex DNA and inhibits telomerase and ALT [216, 217]. Its positional isomer TMPyP2 is a poor G-quadruplex-interactive compound and can be used as a negative control of TMPyP4 [218]. Later studies revealed that TMPyP4 interacts with the c-MYC promoter G-quadruplex and downregulates c-MYC [54, 197]. TMPyP4 and TMPyP2 have been one of the most widely used molecules in G-quadruplex research. Telomestatin is a natural product isolated from Streptomyces anulatus 3533-SV4 to be a highly potent inhibitor of telomerase [219] and active against human cancers by stabilizing telomeric G-quadruplex and inhibit telomere-protein binding [220\u2013223]. BRACO19 is a rationally designed trisubstituted acridine to directly target telomeric G-quadruplex [224] and was shown to inhibit telomerase and induce telomere uncapping in human cancer cells [195] and have high in vivo activity against different cancer xenograft models [225, 226]. 12459 is a triazine G4-ligand that exhibits anti-telomerase activity but also appears to involve BCL-2 and hTERT splicing [192, 227, 228]. Closely related pyridine dicarboxamide derivatives 360A/307A and bisquinolinium compounds Phen-DC(3)/Phen-DC(6) are highly selective G-quadruplex ligands and were shown to be active against both telomeric and c-MYC G-quadruplex and inhibit c-MYC gene transcription in tumor cells, as well as bind to a G-quadruplex formed in the 5\u2032-UTR of TRF2 mRNA to repress translation [133, 229\u2013232]. Phen-DC was also shown to trigger genetic instability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [207]. PDS is a pyridostatin compound which shows potent G-quadruplex- stabilization and has been widely used to study G-quadruplex functions and G-quadruplex-induced DNA damage [176, 210\u2013212, 233]. In addition, G-quadruplex DNA was also shown to be potential cancer therapeutics. AS1411 (Antisoma, London, UK) is an unmodified 26-nt G-quadruplex forming oligonucleotide that has been in Phase II trials for treatment of renal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia [234].",

            "text": " G-quadruplex-interactive compounds have contributed immensely to understanding G-quadruplex functions and potential as a therapeutic target. Different G-quadruplex-ligands show various levels of selectivity, between G-quadruplex structures over other forms of DNA and between different G-quadruplexes, and this selectivity is likely to be related to their biological activity. Conventional and in silico screening methods as well as structure-based rational drug design were actively pursued in the development of G-quadruplex-targeting small molecules. A common feature among the G-quadruplex-ligands is the presence of a fused ring system that is capable of stacking with the terminal G-tetrads. In addition, a crescent-shaped asymmetric pharmacophore that can recruit a DNA base and cationic side chain substituents that have the propensity to interact with G-quadruplex grooves can give rise to specific interactions (Fig. 1d) [235, 236]. Structural data of G-quadruplex-ligand complexes has been playing an important role in the understanding of small molecule recognition of G-quadruplexes and the design of G-quadruplex-ligands [18, 237]. This includes a handful NMR solution structures of intramolecular G-quadruplex-ligand complexes, including c-MYC G-quadruplex-ligand complexes [235, 238\u2013240] and telomeric G-quadruplex-ligand complexes [236, 241\u2013243], and X-ray crystallographic structures of intramolecular and intermolecular telomeric G-quadruplex-ligand complexes [43, 237, 244\u2013250].",

Biosensor- surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a quantitative approach for the study of small molecule and protein ligand-quadruplex nucleic acid interactions in real time. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) method can be used to characterize G-quadruplex formation and to monitor ligand binding. Mass spectroscopy can also be used to characterize G-quadruplex structures and ligand binding. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be used to obtain thermodynamic and sometimes kinetic parameters of G-quadruplexes. X-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy provide structural information of G-quadruplexes and ligand complexes, while molecular dynamics simulation can also be used to study G-quadruplex structures and small molecule binding.",

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting, and DNA polymerase stop (Pol-stop) assay are widely used to study G-quadruplex formation, protein complexes, and ligand interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays are used to probe protein interactions with G-quadruplex-forming DNA sequences. A combination of biochemical and biophysical methods can be used to monitor co-transcriptional formation of G-quadruplexes (transcription assay) and to quantitatively analyze the effects of G-quadruplex formation on DNA replication (replication assay). Single-molecule methods such as optical and magnetic tweezers, atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy can be used to investigate G-quadruplex conformations, ligand interactions, and protein interactions. In addition, methods are used to discover and develop G-quadruplex-targeting molecules, such as FRET-based high-throughput screening of small molecule ligands, and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers that are designed to bind to G-quadruplexes. G-quadruplexes are also used in nanoparticle-based assays, and as biocatalysts such as G-quadruplex DNAzymes.",

G4-specific antibodies and fluorescence probes are used to detect and visualize G-quadruplexes in cells.
