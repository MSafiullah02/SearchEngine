This syndrome usually affects postmenopausal women, and it is frequently triggered by physical or emotional stress. [1] [2] [3] It consists of transitory left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the context of normal coronary arteries. [1] [2] [3] The pathophysiology is not completely understood, but it is thought that sympathetic hyperactivity due to an increase in circulating catecholamines leads to ventricular dysfunction. 2,3 Several variants are described: the apical variant is the most common one and is more frequently associated with emotional triggers, whereas the midventricular and inverted types are less frequent, and are more commonly related with associated neurological damage. 4, 5 Since left ventricular function recovers in the following days or weeks after the beginning of symptoms, this syndrome was previously considered a benign entity with a very good prognosis.",

Cardiac biomarkers were elevated (troponin I 0was initially treated as an acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation and was given treatment with aspirin, ticagrelor, fondaparinux, and atorvastatin.Bedside echocardiography demonstrated depressed left ventricular function with akinesia of the apical segments and mid anterior septum. The invasive coronary angiography, performed 24 h after admission, showed mild stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. Left ventriculogram exhibited apical akinesia with hypercontractility of basal segments, and moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction (Fig. 2) (video 1 of the supplementary data). Taking into account all the previous findings, the case was interpreted as a typical variant of stress cardiomyopathy. Dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation were withdrawn, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers were started. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram performed 48 h later, showed improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction with an estimated left ventricular ejection function of 50%, with no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve or outflow tract obstruction.",
