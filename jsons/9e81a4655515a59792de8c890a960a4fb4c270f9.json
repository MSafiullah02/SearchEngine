It is a huge-scale phenomenon of high pressure transportation that occurs around the Lunar New Year in China. The Travel rush usually begins 15 days before Lunar New Year's Day and lasts for 40 days. A report from the Chinese Ministry of Transportation shows the total number of public transportation trips during this period in 2019 was 2.98 billion, a number equivalent to all Europeans, Oceanians, and Africans collectively travelling once. Therefore, the BBC referred to the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush as \"the world's largest population migration every year.\" The 2020 Spring Festival travelling started on January 10 and will end on February 18, a total of 40 days. Due to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China, this year's travel rush is special.",

This includes the effects on population mobility during the Chinese Spring Festival, and how this affects changes in the 2019-nCoV-infected population. We used the Baidu's Big Data to obtain five million trips and destinations of people travelling out of Wuhan between January 10 and 22, 2020, ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival. Wuhan was sealed off on January 23, 2020. From that date, people were prohibited from leaving Wuhan and all bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance passenger transportation were suspended.",

As a result, 2019-nCoV was brought to other provinces across China as well as to other countries around the world, causing worldwide concern. With the progress of the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as of January 31, 2020, a total of 9692 cases were diagnosed and 213 people have died. It is not known what trend the 2019-nCoV epidemic is going to take and when it will reach its peak. We think that the beginning of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush was an important factor in spreading the 2019-nCoV. If the Chinese government would have implemented the closure of Wuhan before the start of the travel rush, it is possible that the impact of 2019-nCoV would have been considerably lower. We should also pay attention to the fact that the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush is about to enter its second climax towards February 18, 2020, and with it the problems will come again. People who are now closed in Wuhan will start returning to their work places in other parts of China. This \"second big migration,\" when the workers return to work, should be at the focus of our attention. This second migration process might escalate the epidemic as we are about to quell it. The attention of the government is required to minimize the impact of this second wave of migration. We envisage two solutions:",
