According to the DSM-V criteria, the main characteristic of specific phobias is fear or anxiety limited by the phobia source. If the individual occasionally feels anxious when encountering a particular object or situation, s/he is not to be diagnosed with specific phobia. The response must be different from the usual and temporary fears that are common in society. At the same time, the level of fear or anxiety must be intense. The level of fear may vary depending on the proximity to the object or the situation. However, individuals do not have to show an extreme and meaningless anxiety response in order to be diagnosed with specific phobia. Considering the situation and the environment, the individual's \"disproportionate\" fear and anxiety response is sufficient for diagnosis (APA, 2013) .",

In this sense, major man-made catastrophes or natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can be the environmental trigger of phobic conditions. People develop disproportional cognitive, affective, or behavioral responses to the objects and situations that they associate with the COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 hand, it is often noted in anecdotal experiences that people are afraid of being infected with COVID-19. Previous studies show that natural disasters such as an earthquake or a tsunami; manmade catastrophes such as explosions, wars or terrorism; or epidemics such as MERS, SARS or Ebola lead to detrimental emotions such as phobia, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, and hostility in the short and long terms (Colorado, 2017; Hossain et al., 2020; Steinberg & Daniel, 2020; Qi et al., 2020) . Therefore, as expected, people have already started experiencing phobic reactions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic spreads quickly, COVID-19 is expected to lead to increased psycho-pathological problems due to the potential for easy transmission, lack of treatment, and the higher levels of the virus-related deaths (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020) .",
