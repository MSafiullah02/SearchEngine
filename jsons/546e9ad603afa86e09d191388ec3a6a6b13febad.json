Most retain at least the vestiges of genes once required for infectious horizontal transfer, namely envelope genes. In contrast, the long evolutionary histories of retrotransposons are presumed not to have included infectious ancestors. With the characterization of the Gypsy retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster as an infectious, endogenous retrovirus, these distinctions have blurred. A number of plant LTR retroelements possess coding regions whose conceptual translations produce hypothetical proteins with predicted structural elements found in viral envelope proteins, and the term endogenous retrovirus began to be applied to these elements. The question of whether any of the many plant retroelement genes now annotated as \"env-like\" generate proteins that have or had envelope functions remains unanswered.

For mammalian retroviruses and endogenous retroviruses, even in cases where clear evolutionary relationships are inferred from phylogenetic trees based on RT alignments, the corresponding envelope sequences may have diverged to the extent that homology cannot be deduced from global sequence-based analyses (Benit et al. 2001) . However, by restricting multi-sequence alignments to transmembrane subunits, homology has been inferred across retroviral genomes and those of other enveloped viruses, such as Ebola and Marburg, with Class I fusion proteins (Benit et al. 2001) . Although not addressed by Benit et al. (2001) , the observed localized sequence similarities could have been the result of convergent evolution or localized domain capture. Kim et al. (2004) suggested that the homology between distantly related retroviruses is the result of envelope capture, and this hypothesis is supported by the phylogenetic analysis of Benit et al. (2001) .

Plant pararetroviruses, like the Caulimoviruses, are DNA viruses characterized by genomes encoding GAG, PROT, RT, and RH, as well as additional essential proteins (Lazarowitz 2007) . Unlike retroviruses, pararetroviruses are not enveloped, and their infectious cycles do not normally include integration into the host genome (Lazarowitz 2007 ).

Conservation of ENV sequences between the superfamilies in the alignment is limited to a small number of identical residues and a larger number that are similar. But these similarities could also reflect convergent evolution and not evolutionary homology. Nonetheless, assuming homology, the Ty1/ Copia sequences appeared to be monophyletic but the Ty3/Gypsy sequences were not. Instead, one clade of ENV sequences from Ty3/Gypsy elements in soybean, Lotus, and Medicago was the sister group to a subset of ENV sequences associated with elements belonging to the Ty1/Copia superfamily. The neighbor joining trees of the corresponding RT sequences did not generate this tree topology and conformed to the expected segregation of all members of the two superfamilies into two sister clades (Du et al. 2010b ). The authors inferred that the Ty1/Copia env-like gene was acquired from an ancestral member of its sister Ty3/Gypsy clade, long after the capture of the env-like sequence by an ancestral Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon near the crown of the tree (Fig. 6.8) .

This latter group includes members of two families of enveloped viruses: Rhabdoviridae and Bunyaviridae. The former includes Sonchus Yellow Net Virus (SYNV) that generates a virion composed of a lipid envelope embedded with virally encoded glycoproteins, while the latter includes tospoviruses like Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) with a genome that encodes two envelope glycoproteins (Lazarowitz 2007; Whitfield et al. 2005) . In their plant hosts, intracellular SYNV and TSWV particles appear to associate with the nuclear and ER membranes, respectively (Lazarowitz 2007) . In the case of TSWV single-enveloped particles are formed and transferred to feeding thrips (Kikkert et al. 1999) . In thrip hosts, TSWV virions are associated with the plasma membrane and are released from infected cells by fusion with the cell membrane (Whitfield et al. 2005) . However, there are no reports of detected homology between any plant retroelement ENV-like hypothetical protein and those of plant enveloped viruses. The maintenance of envelope-encoding sequences in these viruses appears to be directly related to infectivity in their animal hosts, not in their plant hosts. When maintained solely by serial mechanical inoculations from one infected plant to another, non-enveloped mutant isolates accumulate (Goldbach and Peters 1996) . These isolates are fully capable of mounting a systemic infection in plants after mechanical transfer (Goldbach and Peters 1996) . However, non-enveloped isolates with mutations in the glycoprotein genes have been shown to be incapable of reinfecting the thrip host (Nagata et al. 2000) . These observations provide an attractive, albeit highly speculative, model for the existence of endogenous retrovirus lineages in plants with nonfunctional and functional env-like genes. Confirming this model would require at a minimum the discovery of related elements in invertebrate vectors and demonstrating that virions from plants could fuse with the plasma membranes of the invertebrate host.
