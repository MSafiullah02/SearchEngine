Among this sub\u2010family, the important species for human infections are represented by HSV\u20101, HSV\u20102 and Varicella\u2010Zoster virus. The common HSV treatment is based on acyclovir, valacyclovir and farmcyclovir. Resistant strains are emerging; therefore, new strategies are needed to deal with these infections 3.",

            "text": "HSV\u20101 infection is initiated by the binding of glycoprotein C (gC) to cell surface heparan sulfate 14, 15. The HSV\u20101 gB protein (gB) can also bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, but the binding is less efficient 16. Following attachment, gD binds to one of a number of co\u2010receptors on the host cell membrane, including herpesvirus entry mediator, nectin 1, nectin 2 or 3\u2010O\u2010sulfated heparan sulfate, resulting in a conformational change in gD 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. The conformational change in gD is believed to trigger the formation of a fusion complex, which enables fusion to ensue. The co\u2010expression of gD, gB and gH\u2010gL heterodimer in the same cell results in cell\u2013cell fusion, indicating that these four proteins constitute the minimal fusion apparatus 23, 24, 25, 26. Although the entry pathways of other enveloped viruses share similar patterns, most systems for which molecular details have been gathered rely on a single fusion protein 27. HSV\u20101 is singular because it uses both gB and gH/gL as its core fusion machinery 28, 29. The gH/gL complex and gB only interact with each other in response to receptor binding by gD 30, 31 and this interaction is required for allowing fusion to occur 32. The tridimensional structure of gH/gL of HSV\u20102 showed that the gH/gL heterodimer does not resemble any known viral fusogen, which may support different roles for gH including that of being a fusion regulator through its interaction with gB 33. A broad literature describes gH as involved in the entry process, for example, certain mutations in the transmembrane (TM) region and cytoplasmic tail affect fusion 34, 35, 36, 37, as do mutations in the region preceding the TM 38. Furthermore, peptides matching a number of regions of the gH ectodomain have been shown to interact with membranes and proposed to play a role in the fusion process, probably through regulation of gB activity and/or direct membrane interactions at the fusion site 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. In HSV\u2010infected cells and on mature virions, gH and gL are always found together as an heterodimer, in a stable 1 : 1 complex 33, 48 and rely on one another for proper folding, post\u2010translational processing and transport to the cell and virion surface 49, 50, 51, 52. HSV\u20101 gH is a 838\u2010residue type 1 membrane glycoprotein. The ectodomain contains seven N\u2010glycosylation sites and eight cysteine residues forming at least two disulphide bonds between cysteines 5 and 6 (residue 554 and 589) and cysteines 7 and 8 (residues 652 and 706) 48, 53, 54; gL is a 224\u2010residue protein with a signal peptide but no TM region.",

Considering the different size of the two glycoproteins under study, we decided to prepare libraries with different overlapping lengths: a library of 25\u2010mer peptides extending from residues 21 to 805 (just at the beginning of the TM domain) of gH and a second library of 15\u2010mer peptides from residues 20 to 224 corresponding to the whole sequence of gL. The first (gH) library was made of peptides overlapping each other by 20 residues (Supplementary Table S1), while the latter was designed with a 10 residue overlap (Supplementary Table S2), and both signal peptides were excluded from our analysis. In detail, we excluded the first 25 aa from gH sequence (including the peptide signal 1\u201318 aa) and the first 19 aa from gL sequence. The libraries were screened for peptides with inhibitory activity by using a plaque reduction assay in which both virus and cells were exposed to the peptides prior to infection and the peptides remained present throughout the assay. The peptide efficacy was measured by a plaque reduction assay as described in the Materials and Methods. The criterion for considering a peptide of potential interest was the inhibition of at least 50% of plaque formation at a concentration of 150 \u03bcM. Figure 1 shows the gH\u2010overlapping peptides and their antiviral activities in the screening. Of the 148 peptides in the gH\u2010library, 21 peptides showed an inhibition activity more than 50% (Table 1), while the threshold was not reached by any of the gL peptides (Supplementary Table S2). The 21 gH peptides showing inhibitory activity corresponded to residues 346 to 375 (H65\u2013H66), 381 to 405 (H72), 396 to 425 (H75\u2013H76), 446 to 470 (H85), 456 to 485 (H87\u2013H88), 491 to 520 (H94\u2013H95), 506 to 530 (H97), 596 to 620 (H115), 606 to 630 (H117), 616 to 660 (H119\u2013H123), 646 to 670 (H125), 746 to 775 (H145\u2013H146). The locations of the inhibitory peptides on the gH crystal structure are shown in Figure 2, and we graphically subdivided their localization in four areas.

            "text": "In the present study, we have extended these studies applying a more generalized peptide\u2010based approach to scan the entire gH ectodomain and its accompanying glycoprotein gL. The chosen threshold for including into the category of putative inhibitory peptides was dictated by the general high concentration needed for exerting an antiviral activity of HSV\u2010derived peptides. Previous works have shown that concentrations of peptide ranging from 10 to over 150 \u03bcM are needed to inhibit HSV infectivity. Nevertheless, the results obtained prove that peptide\u2010based strategies targeting regions of the proteins with predictable structures or motifs represent a valid option when searching functional regions of a protein; in fact, our whole protein scan confirmed as regions of interest several domains which were already found to posses some antiviral activity based on their structural characteristics. Peptides H85, H87 and H88, spanning the region of gH from 446 to 485, partially overlap the helical peptide previously named H\u2010HR1 (aa 444\u2013479) able to reduce infectivity in a consistent manner, albeit at the high concentration of 250 \u03bcM 64, 67. Peptides H94, H95, H97 and H119, H120, H121, H122 and H123 overlap peptides gH493\u2013537 and gH626\u2013644, which were found able to inhibit HSV entry with approximately 60% of inhibition at 250 \u03bcM. Hydropathy analysis based on the hydrophobicity\u2010at\u2010interface scale proposed by Wimley and White 66 enabled the detection of these two domains of HSV gH able to induce rapid membrane fusion and inhibit viral entry. A shorter peptide gH493\u2013512, corresponding only to the N\u2010terminus of gH493\u2013537 and almost completely overlapping H94, H95 and H97 of the present work, was able to inhibit HSV entry even more effectively 45. Finally, peptides H145 and H146 at the extreme C\u2010terminus of the gH ectodomain (the TM helical domain starts at aa 804) have been previously individuated as being part of a larger pre\u2010TM domain with the ability of inhibiting virus infectivity, and a peptide previously named pTM6 44 exactly corresponds to peptide H146 of the present study. Nevertheless, the remaining peptides have been newly identified and presented an inhibitory activity above the set threshold. These are peptides H65\u2013H66, H75\u2013H76, H115, H117 and H125, which were found to exhibit inhibitory effects against HSV\u20101 plaque formation (Table 1).",

Chemical and physical properties highlight shared characteristic for some peptides. In detail, we reported in Figure 3 the 21 peptides subdivided for their isoelectric point grouped as acid (pH from 0 to 6), neutral (pH from 6 to 8) and basic (pH from 8 to 14). In second instance, the peptides were clustered based on their charge at pH 7. As shown in Figure 3, we found that some peptides are represented in specific clusters like H65, H145 and H146 for the first group as well as for H75, H95 and H123 in the second. Interestingly, most new inhibiting peptides are present in the acid (H65, H66, H115, H117) and basic (H125, H76) groups, while only one peptide (H75) is present in the neutral group. Moreover, we performed a primary and secondary structure analysis on the inhibiting gH peptides (Figure 4). Peptides clustered together by a sequence homology point of view (Figure 4A), and the clusters are directly associated with inhibition activity (Figure 4B). For instance, the cluster 5 had a percentage of viral inhibition close to 80%, while the clusters 3 and 6 just above 50%. Secondary structure bioinformatics peptide analysis is reported in Figure 4C, where we observed that in the cluster 5, a different distribution of helical and coil structure with low presence of extended regions is present compared to the others.",

            "text": "Most of the viral peptide entry inhibitors described so far were intentionally designed in order to inhibit viral entry by competing with intermolecular interactions using amino acid specific sequences mostly derived from viral fusion proteins. However, an activity without a specific molecular target can be envisaged for many entry inhibitor peptides. These peptides, albeit being derived from viral surface proteins, do not belong to well\u2010known HR domains, but are often scattered in exposed regions of surface proteins or in domains that may only become exposed following conformational modifications triggered by binding of viruses to receptors or by environmental changes inside endosomes. The current understanding of the mechanisms of action of these peptides finds a hallmark in their propensity for membrane binding due to their interfacial hydrophobicity or amphipaticity 44, 45, 64, 68. In view of this characteristic, peptides could hamper virus entry by establishing direct physical interactions at hydrophobic interfaces on membranes or fusion proteins. Essentially, peptides can bind membranes, membrane proteins or virus particles, thereby exert a steric hindering effect on the early stages of viral penetration such as viral binding and/or membrane fusion. Sometimes, they can interfere with fusion protein modifications by premature initiation of the fusion proteins, which become unable to promote fusion once the peptides are bound to the viral envelope membrane. In this study, we have described an alternative approach for identifying functionally important regions of HSV\u20101 gH and gL, showing for the first time the HSV\u20101 inhibition activity of unreported peptides derived from gH protein. The approach involved the synthesis of two libraries of overlapping peptides that encompassed the entire ectodomains of gH and gL.",

            "text": "Brute\u2010force scanning approaches have proved to be of interest for analysing proteins of several viruses; in fact, potential antiviral peptides against hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been discovered by screening 441 overlapping peptides (18\u2010mers) covering the entire HCV polyprotein 69, 70. Eleven peptides with strong antiviral activity were identified. The most active inhibitory peptide, called C5A, showed significant hydrophobic and membrane binding propensity and was suggested to directly interact with the HCV viral envelope blocking infection when treating viruses during or prior to the initial entry stage. Interestingly, C5A was also able to inhibit HIV by disrupting the integrity of the viral envelope 71. Following this line, four proteins considered to play a role for promoting HCV entry (namely: CD81, scavenger receptor B1, claudin 1 and occluding) were analysed by an overlapping 18 amino acid peptide scanning strategy, and out of 113 peptides, two of them derived from claudin 1 showed potent inhibitory activity against HCV infectivity 72. Furthermore, HCV has also been recently analysed by screening a peptide library covering the full\u2010length E1 and E2 amino acids sequences where a peptide from the E2 stem domain was found to block cell entry of HCV peseudoparticles at nanomolar concentrations. This peptide is of sure potential interest because it proved to be efficient against the major HCV genotypes from 1 to 6 73. Another study assessed the activity of 95\u2010overlapping peptides (15\u2010mers) covering the entire VP1 capsid protein of Enterovirus 71, an important human pathogen which may cause severe neurological complications. In this case, the strategy proved to be also usable for searching potential peptide inhibitors in non\u2010enveloped viruses, with the discovery of four peptides able to inhibit EV\u201071 infection by more than 80% 74. A further study described a 10\u2010mer overlapped peptide library synthesized by combinatorial approach where a peptide derived from the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) could block the binding to the cellular receptor and, thus, the entry into target cells 75. Bai et al.\n76 used a phage display methodology to identify a peptide (named P1) to inhibit West Nile virus (WNV) infectivity, possibly by binding to the envelope glycoprotein (E protein) necessary for membrane fusion. A modified version of P1, named P9, showed a strongly increased inhibitory activity against WNV at micrometre concentrations, and, more interestingly, entered the brain by crossing the blood brain barrier to reduce infectivity in a mouse model of brain infection. Moreover, an interesting study sparkling from the observation that HIV patients co\u2010infected with the common and asymptomatic GB virus C (a virus related to HCV) present lower HIV viremia suggested the analysis of overlapping peptides from the E2 protein from the GB virus C and allowed the identification of two peptides able to inhibit HIV in vitro by their competitive binding at the gp41\u2013gp120 interface 77, 78. Also, HSV glycoproteins have been analysed by a peptide scanning strategy. A library of overlapping 15\u2010mer peptides encompassing the ectodomain of gB was synthesized and tested for HSV infectivity inhibition 79. Seven of the peptides inhibited infectivity by 50% or more when tested at 100\u2010\u03bcM concentrations.",

            "text": "Interestingly, many of the antiviral peptides identified by these brute force approaches overlap with many peptides discovered by analysing hydrophobicity at interface scales 68. The example of HSV gB is remarkable, because all the peptides (at least the most active) had also been previously described as membrane\u2010interacting 80 sequences using the WWIHS66. Our results, scanning the entire sequences of HSV\u20101 gH and gL, confirm that the WWIHS is a powerful mean to identify potential antiviral peptides, but some regions of potential interest can remain underscored; therefore, a systematic analysis of the whole sequence by overlapping peptide libraries can add more detailed information on the regions involved in inhibition. In fact, we were able to detect four areas where peptides could be grouped for their antiviral activity. Some of the identified regions overlap with peptides already described which were discovered by bioinformatics tools, thereby strengthening this clear relationship between the function and the physiochemical character of peptides. In particular, the four identified inhibitory areas are mainly located in the regions of the glycoprotein named H2, while only a small area (S4) is located in the H3 region. The H2 domain of gH is mainly characterized by a bundle of helices and a few extended regions. In gH derived from Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a synthaxin like bundle (SLB) is present in this region 81, and this motif has proved to be of importance because its disruption can lead to impaired replication activity of the virus 82. Interestingly, one of our inhibitory peptides is located in the HSV\u20101 gH corresponding region. Surprisingly, we did not detect any activity in inhibition assays when testing gL derived peptides. This may likely account for the negligible role of gL in membrane interactions. Nevertheless, also domain H1 of gH which is mainly devoted to interact with gL did not provide any inhibitory peptides. H1 sub\u2010domains clamp gL like tongs and make extensive contacts between the interacting highly complementary surfaces. In fact, the two proteins need each other to fold correctly and gL is a powerful scaffolding protein for gH. The inability of gH peptides derived from the H1 domain to function as inhibitors of infectivity can be explained by the fact that the formation of the highly stable complex between the two glycoproteins happens during the maturation and egress from the infected cell; therefore, the structure is already definitive when the heterodimer becomes expressed on the mature virion envelope. Disruption of the gH:gL interaction is not likely to happen because the whole H1 domain would result in an unfolded structure in absence of gL. The four areas of active peptides are depicted in Figure 5 where the filled surface of the protein is shown. It is of interest to note that inhibitory areas S2, S3 and S4 are mainly occupying regions of gH domains H2 and H3 and are exposed to the external surface of the protein, while only area S1 is partially buried inside and only partially exposed to the outside. Therefore, this observation is consistent with the minor inhibitory activity of peptides belonging to area S1. Furthermore, inhibitory area S4 precedes the C\u2010terminal TM domain of gH and is part of the C\u2010teminal H3 ectodomain mainly composed of \u03b2\u2010sheets which constitute a large patch of hydrophobic residues able to interact with the cell membrane during the fusion process or modifying the curvature of the viral envelope.",
