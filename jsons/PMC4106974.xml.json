With the exception of X rays, application of medical imaging modalities focusing specifically on viral infection and diseases associated with BSL 4 pathogens has thus far been impossible. The use of techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will provide unique insights into disease pathogenesis including inflammation, altered systemic vascular function, coagulation, and tissue damage. With these technologies, investigators can chart the evolution of lesions in individual animals and link these findings with clinical manifestations, changes in laboratory values, and other indicators of disease severity. Investigators and veterinarians analyze generated data in real time and alter treatment protocols or clinical algorithms. These adjustments will not only improve the care and well being of the animal but will also begin to mimic normal care practices in clinical settings.",

Under this rule, regulators expect that the pathophysiologic emerging disease process in the animal model is reasonably well understood and recapitulates the human condition. Demonstration that the MCM mitigates this disease is also required. Usually, the Food and Drug Administration requires this demonstration in more than one animal species unless a model in a single species is demonstrated to be \u2018sufficiently well characterized\u2019 to predict therapeutic responses. In that case, a second species may not be needed.

This endpoint has presented significant challenges when the best available models are not uniformly lethal or when the disease severity does not match human disease from emerging pathogens. As a result, investigators are often faced with the daunting choices of using large numbers of animals, adapting the pathogen of interest to be more lethal in animal model(s), or developing models using genetically modified animals. By definition, adaptation changes the nature of the pathogen which raised concerns regarding relevance to the human pathogen as well as dual use regulatory concerns. While genetically altered animals may offer alternatives, the expression or deletion of the gene of interest usually fails to fully recapitulate the disease following infection. Generally, investigators are concerned that expression or deletion of a gene typically results in altered phenotypes that may impact the interpretation of results from these models. The availability of MI opens the potential to identify and use alternative outcomes in lieu of these other options.",

Thus, these modalities complement conventional animal studies that rely on serial euthanasia and necropsies to describe pathogenesis. Through MI, scientists at the IRF are already studying the development of consolidations in the lungs of nonhuman primates infected with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV). With MI, scientists are able to chart the development and quantification of lung lesions (Fig. 1). This ability will be critical for assessing potential countermeasures in this very mild disease model. In addition, use of medical imaging also has the potential to reduce the number of animals needed during a study, complying with Russell and Burch\u2019s three Rs (refinement, reduction, and replacement of the use of animals in research) of animal research. For instance, the longitudinal approach may increase the statistical power needed to assess the efficacy of an investigational drug or treatment while decreasing total animal numbers needed for research (Rudin & Weissleder, 2003).",

MR images can be obtained with or without contrast agents. By exploiting endogenous sources of contrast, exogenous and potentially harmful contrast agents are not required. The wide variety of MRI techniques available provides flexibility in monitoring infectious disease processes in the BSL 4 environment. For instance, a number of MRI techniques have been developed to assess vascular permeability, integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier, and edema formation. In addition to quantifying vascular permeability, MRI could potentially be used to track cell migration (Hoehn et al., 2007) during viral infections. MRI will therefore be a useful tool to follow the development of endothelial leakage during the progression of a viral hemorrhagic fever or to observe real time immune responses as visualized by macrophage migration postinoculation. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures changes in relative amounts of certain metabolites in an infected tissue of interest during the course of infection or therapeutic intervention.",

The subject is then imaged and the concentrations of the probe in tissues are measured. Images of probe uptake with PET are overlaid or co registered with the three dimensional images of the internal structures of the subject (CT). For example, if investigators are interested in identifying tissues or regions with increased metabolism as an indicator for inflammation or increased cellular replication, fluorodeoxyglucose (18F FDG), an analog of glucose, is administered to the subject. As cells take up this glucose analog, the probe accumulates, and the scintillation crystals on the detectors measure the released photons. When combined with CT and image analysis, investigators visualize and quantitate areas of inflammation in discrete anatomic locations. PET is presently being used at the IRF to establish the tissue distribution of T705 (an antiviral drug), the relationship between plasma and tissue levels of T705, and the effect of viral infection on these parameters, essential information required under the FDA Efficacy Rule. PET/CT has also been used at the IRF for studies of monkeypox (Dyall et al., 2011), a surrogate of smallpox, to show the development and progression of diseases both morphologically and physiologically. In addition to qualitative interpretation of the medical images, quantitative analysis of changes in morphology and function of animal anatomy allows for statistical analysis of findings for the animal models in vivo.",

            "text": "Incorporation and use of MI equipment in maximum containment present a unique set of challenges for architects, engineers, safety officials, scientists. If the imaging equipment is located inside high containment, subjecting the imaging device to decontamination procedures may increase the risk of damage (e.g. caustic etching of detectors, progressive degradation of device wiring insulation, corrosion of solder points). In general, BSL 3 and BSL 4 laboratory areas are decontaminated by exposure to paraformaldehyde gas followed by ammonium bicarbonate neutralization. Frequent maintenance of MI equipment is often necessary, and requiring service engineers to enter BSL 4 areas is an untenable option. Two options were considered to permit safe insertion of the infected animals into the bore of the instrument without breaking the biocontainment barrier. One option is to place the animal in a closed containment tube that is then transported and positioned within the bore of the instrument. However, the logistics of maintaining ventilation and anesthesia of these animals while maintaining BSL 4 conditions inside the tube seem insurmountable. The alternative approach is to reconfigure the equipment, leaving only the bare minimum of components within the BSL 4 laboratory and developing an extension of the BSL 4 laboratory that protrudes into the bore of each machine. These unique challenges were innovatively addressed (de Kok Mercado et al., 2011) by placing the bulk of the imaging equipment outside the BSL 4 suite (Fig. 2). The high containment zone is extended into the bore of each imaging device with the use of transparent biocontainment tubes made of polycarbonate resin thermoplastic (Philips Bioshield\u2122, North Ryde, Australia). This design facilitates routine maintenance of the delicate instruments by factory trained personnel without entering the BSL 4 environment. With the animal inside the biocontainment tube, the veterinary care team has access to the animal during the procedures to ensure the health and well being of the animal. Photographs of the \u2018hot\u2019 and \u2018cold\u2019 sides of the SPECT imaging rooms are presented in Fig. 3.",

Perhaps the most appreciable challenge was the ability to maintain functions of the anesthetized animal (respiration rate, heart rate and rhythm, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, core temperature) during MI procedures while ensuring staff safety. To maintain these functions, advanced life support, including multiparameter patient monitors (e.g. electrocardiography), and forced air warming blankets were put into place. In addition, inhalation anesthesia equipment and mechanical ventilators for respiration compromised animals or for breathe holds required for imaging were used throughout the facility.

Cameras and wireless communication systems for veterinary medicine personnel also have been developed and implemented for communication with imaging team outside of containment and for visualization of the operations and the animal in the bore of the containment tube. These protocols represent just a few examples of the myriad of procedures and practices that were developed de novo for this facility.",

In addition to the three Rs, the committee stressed the importance of using methods to develop animal models that will transfer to a culture of good laboratory practices for the development of MCM. In the past, many investigations relied on the similarities in the phenotypic presentation of disease in animals compared to humans, rather than similarities in the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. By relying on phenotypic similarities and assumed absolute conservation of molecular processes in closely related animals of different species, investigators have raised doubts about the ability of existing animal models to accurately recapitulate human disease or predict efficacy of candidate therapeutics in humans (Seok et al., 2013). In addition, the scientific, funding, and regulatory communities realize that one animal model may not recapitulate all aspects of disease. Expectation of uniform or near uniform lethality from pathogen challenge is neither reasonable or in all cases appropriate. As a result, with the use of alternative endpoints besides lethality, investigators can evaluate MCM in nonlethal models rather than forcing a disease course more severe than the human condition.",
