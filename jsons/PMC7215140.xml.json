            "text": "A very large proportion of patients admitted to ICU for Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) fulfill acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) criteria according to Berlin definition [1\u20133]. In a large series of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-associated respiratory failure, the majority of intubated patients were ventilated with high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [1]. However, information about specific individual characteristics of respiratory mechanics of SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS remains very limited [4\u20136]. Based on their experience during the crisis, some authors suggested that part of the SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS may present relatively high respiratory system compliance (CRS) and poor recruitability with PEEP, contrasting with severe hypoxemia. Accordingly, high levels of PEEP might be harmful in this so-called \u201cphenotype\u201d. The aim of this prospective study is to describe the characteristics of the respiratory mechanics of SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS, and, in particular, whether the lungs are recruitable with high levels of PEEP.",

The lung volume predicted by the compliance at low PEEP represents the minimum predicted change in lung volume corresponding to the change in pressure between the 2 PEEP levels (i.e. the change in lung volume if no recruitment occurs) and is equal to the product of CRS at PEEP 5 cmH2O (or above AOP) and PEEP change (i.e. 10 cmH2O or 15-AOP).",

The respiratory system compliance at PEEP 5 cmH2O or above AOP was used as a surrogate for the compliance of the baby lung. A high R/I ratio is considered to be associated with a high potential for lung recruitment. As previously described, a threshold of 0.5 was used to differentiate poorly recruitable from highly recruitable patients [7].",

Interestingly, repetitive measurements showed that some of them became recruitable potentially depending on the time course evolution of the disease and the respiratory treatment they received (notably prone positioning). Authors concluded that R/I ratio is feasible, even in the constrained Covid-19 environment and may allow to guide individual titration of PEEP to limit potential harmful effects expected with high PEEP in poorly recruitable patients. Most (75%) of these patients received NIV or HFNC before intubation for a median of 5 [IQR, 4\u20137] days. This could lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury [17] that may explain, at least in part, their low respiratory system compliance (around 20 mL/cmH2O) after intubation.

Based on these original observations, authors challenged the classical recommendations for PEEP titration and prone positioning based on the severity of hypoxemia [19], suggesting that PEEP may lead to severe hemodynamic impairment and fluid retention in poorly recruitable patients while prone position may be less efficient imposing an unnecessary additional workload in the context of the pandemic. The same group of authors proposed a concise physiological description of what they called \u201cphenotypes L and H\u201d. Briefly they opposed the possible high proportion of poorly recruitable patients with near-normal compliance (\u201cL\u201d) to patients with low compliance and high potential for recruitment (\u201cH\u201d not different from classical non-Covid-19 ARDS) that may benefit from higher PEEP and prone position.

Conversely, poorly recruitable patients exhibited a non-significant trend toward higher CRS at low PEEP compared to highly recruitable patients. Moreover, the trend in decrease in CRS observed in these patients when PEEP is increased may reflect overinflation thus indicating the risk associated with high PEEP in these patients. Of note, the increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio with PEEP in poorly recruitable patients may be explained, at least in part, by a potential reduction in cardiac output induced by PEEP that may have contributed to decrease the shunt fraction [13].

Second, the respiratory mechanics characterization at two levels of PEEP and the R/I ratio do definitively not allow to determine accurately the optimal PEEP level.

Neither individual values of PaO2/FiO2 ratio or CRS on low or high PEEP nor their changes after a change of PEEP allowed to distinguish highly recruitable from poorly recruitable patients. Present observations suggest that a systematic R/I ratio evaluation may be useful to guide initial setting of PEEP in the context of SARS-Cov2-associated ARDS.",
