The MERS outbreak revealed problems in the medical delivery system, in the Korean medical quarantine system, and in the IC system in hospitals, resulting in Korean hospitals suffering substantial financial losses.4 Accordingly, the Korean government prepared and implemented strategies to support the establishment of the IC infrastructure in May 2016, by approving plans to revise measures concerning health insurance fees to promote prevention and prevent spread of HAIs.5 Korea's national health insurance is public health insurance controlled and managed by the government.",

Further, the number of APN nurse applications is decreasing, perhaps owing to difficulty in predicting the demand for APNs, a lack of specificity in Korea's insurance system, the absence of legal specifications on the role of APNs, a lack of employment opportunities in their area after qualification, and no changes in treatment or working conditions of nurses after obtaining APN certification.9\n",

Also, existing graduate schools increased their quota, more than doubling the number of students from 25 in the 3 graduate schools to 60 in the 6 graduate schools.2 Three graduate schools are operated by professors without ICAPN certification because of a shortage of professors with ICAPN certifications and because the government allows adjunct professors to teach courses.2\n",

Thus, the number of students applying for ICAPN certification and graduate schools offering master's level certification have increased, leading to positive outcomes. The new law also meant nurses with ICAPN certification worked in IC departments of hospitals; previously, very few nurses worked in their certificated field. These changes should contribute to the prevention and control of infection in hospitals by using competent IC advanced practice nurses who have been systematically trained and are performing IC tasks. However, because the ICAPN curriculum is a specialized field that has very different characteristics from other specialized nursing fields, it is essential that a full-time certified ICAPN professor be in charge of the ICAPN curriculum in graduate schools. Further, compensation toward an independent fund to recognize the contribution of IC advanced practice nurses professional nursing practices or professional practice license will help increase IC advanced practice nurses\u2019 work satisfaction, and thus the number of nurses that graduate with ICAPN certification. To establish and operate these IC training programs efficiently, predictive studies are needed concerning future demand for ICAPN personnel. Additionally, the curriculum should be improved and standardized by identifying the educational needs of IC advanced practice nurses continuously, to address the emergence of new infectious diseases and the changing paradigm of the medical environment.",
