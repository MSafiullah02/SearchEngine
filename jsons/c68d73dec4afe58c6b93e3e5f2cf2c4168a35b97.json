In concern of transmission risk of discharged patients, another detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was done before discharge, while both of the RT-PCR results were positive. Patients' data were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed. Sputum was sampled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China).

She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in our center on Jan. 21 (Day 1) with a positive RT-PCR test in sputum and bilateral infiltration lesions on chest CT images (Fig. 1a) . She was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and Arbidol combined with methylprednisolone and was afebrile by Day 6. Sputum was sampled daily for SARS-CoV-2 detection and the results turned negative on Day 8 and Day 10. Lung CT scan on Day 9 showed reduced infusion lesions (Fig. 1b) .

Therefore, inappropriate sampling of throat swabs or oral fluid instead of deep respiratory specimens may lead to inadequate sampling and low or variable detection rates. Also, patients who present with dry cough or are in the recovery stage rarely have expectorated sputum. Deep lung tissue specimens from induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are also impractical given the limited resources and risk of transmission. Thus, it is important to establish repeated sampling following standardized procedures and optimized detection methods at each treatment facility.",

This indicates the value of chest CT images in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In these two cases, absorption of lesions in chest CT was apparent at the time when RT-CRP of SARS-CoV-2 turned negative for the first time, and the reduction of lesion size was significant (over 50%). Especially for Patient 1, release of clinical symptoms with apparently improved chest CT image was not equivalent to no excretion of SARS-CoV-2. According to recent research (Guan et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020) , SARS-CoV-2 was not only secreted through the upper repertory tract, but also through the digestive and urinary tracts and the lacrimal passage. A standardized assessment of transmission risk should be based on viral detection of all potential infection routes.",

Clinical evaluation and lung imaging are critical for interpretation of disease progression, while continued viral RT-PCR detection in different specimens would add evidence for evaluating the transmission risk of COVID-19 patients. Continuing isolated observation for discharged patients is required and wearing masks with hand hygiene should also be emphasized in these patients for infection control purposes.",
