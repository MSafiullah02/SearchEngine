This recruiting resulted in an initial sample of 227 mothers of children with ASD. The nature of the research, study design, confidentiality issues, and their choice to enroll or not, as well as the ability to opt out of study at any time, were explained to the mothers. From the initial sample, 32 were excluded because of failure to meet the inclusion criteria (chiefly that the children have a firm diagnosis of ASD), declined to participate due to time and other family constraints, and for personal reasons. Using a random number generator, the remaining 195 mothers were randomized into the MBPBS, MB, or PBS experimental conditions. A CONSORT participant flowchart is presented in Fig. 1.

Binary variables were created for MBPBS, MB, and PBS predictors that were entered in stepwise fashion and followed by meditation practice while controlling for the overall effect of time entered in the first block. Stepwise approach enabled us to estimate which intervention type was the strongest predictor of behavioral outcomes. The strongest predictor was extracted first and the second strongest predictor was extracted after controlling for the effect of the previously extracted predictor until no significant predictors were identified. To estimate a unique effect of meditation practice it was entered into MLR after controlling for time and type of intervention.

The largest progressive decline in perceived stress was evident in the MBPBS group followed by the MB group, with the least decline in the PBS group. ANCOVA indicated a significant effect of a group (MBPBS, MB, and PBS), with a large effect size (F2,170 = 76.64, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.47). There was a significant interaction between time and group (F10,170 = 196.73, p < 0.001), with an even larger effect size (\u03b72 = 0.69), indicating that changes in the mothers\u2019 perceived stress over time depended largely on type of intervention. The mean perceived stress scores of the three groups were not significantly different at the baseline (control) condition. However, post hoc tests showed that mothers in the MBPBS group were significantly less affected by perceived stress (M = 25.47; 95% CI [24.81, 26.13]) compared with both the MB group (M = 28.93; 95% CI [28.27, 29.59]) and the PBS group (M = 31.35; 95% CI [30.69, 32.01]), which showed significantly higher stress scores among all three groups. The overall significant effect of time was also observed (F5,170 = 12.99, p < 0.001, \u03b72 = 0.07), with a modest effect size. Furthermore, there was a significant inverse effect of children\u2019s age on mother\u2019s stress (F1,170 = 4.95, p = 0.027, \u03b72 = 0.03) suggesting that younger children cause significantly more stress to their mothers.",

Also, a greater reduction in aggressive behavior was noted in the MB condition compared with the PBS group. MLR analysis with aggressive events as the outcome variable revealed an overall large effect of time, reflecting shared effectiveness of all three interventions, and explained 28% of reduction in the outcome (R2 = 0.28; \u03b2 = \u2212 0.53; p < 0.001).

When the effects of time and MBPBS were accounted for, both MB and PBS were not significant predictors, but meditation time explained another 29% of reduction in the children\u2019s aggressive behavior, which is a large effect size (R2 = 0.29; \u03b2 = \u2212 0.88; p < 0.001).",

Even though there was a smaller but still substantial reduction of disruptive behavior observed during intervention in the PBS group, a subsequent reduction was not evident during the 3-year follow-up. Similar to aggression, MLR revealed the overall large time effect observed in all groups that accounted for 35% of reduction in disruptive behavior (R2 = 0.35; \u03b2 = \u2212 0.59; p < 0.001). MBPBS explained a further 4% reduction in the outcome (R2 = 0.04; \u03b2 = \u2212 0.20; p = 0.004) and, by considering this effect, no significant contribution was evident for MB and PBS.

The study also provides post-intervention follow-up data for 3 years showing the lasting effects of initial training in MBPBS. This suggests that once mindful parenting was well-established in the mothers, it put mother-child interactions on a positive trajectory that continued well after the initial training.",

Parental distress was assessed using only one well-validated measure of perceived stress (PSS-10) and adding measures on anxiety and depression would permit evaluation of the effects of MBPBS and its components on these affective facets of distress. In addition, measuring distress symptoms in children would reveal potential spillover effects of the mothers\u2019 training and practice of mindfulness on affective distress symptoms in their children.",

One of the consequences of this movement has been the need to add more components to existing programs or developing new programs that are more closely aligned with Buddhist practices. This expansion needs to be juxtaposed against the time and effort needed by practitioners (e.g., parents) to learn, metabolize, and use these practices in their already rather full daily lives. We need to learn more about parental needs, motivations, and their characteristics that mediate their parenting practices to customize mindful parenting programs (Emerson et al. 2020). The stepped care model used in developing the MBPBS program is one way of matching the content of mindfulness programs to the needs and abilities of parents.",
