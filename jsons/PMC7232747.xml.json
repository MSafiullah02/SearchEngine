Cells passed through the two nylon meshes were gently disintegrated by passing through a 25\u2010gauge needle six times to yield PSG cell lysate. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to sediment nuclei. The supernatant (2 mL per tube) was layered on 0.4\u20131.8 m linear sucrose gradient in TMK (12.2 mL per tube), centrifuged at 285 000 g in a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C, and 0.5\u2010mL fractions were collected. Fractions containing ER were monitored by the NADPH\u2010cytochrome c reductase assay [11] and by Western blotting with the rabbit anti\u2010(Drosophila calnexin\u2010peptide) Ig raised against a synthetic peptide, CAQTEESNTKRKRQARKE [12]. For the former assay, a 5\u2010\u00b5L portion of each fraction was mixed with 100 \u00b5L of the assay mixture [0.08 mm cytochrome c (Sigma), 0.1 mm NADPH, 1 mm sodium azide, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5)], incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 min and A\n550 was measured. Fractions containing Golgi complex were monitored by the assay for Golgi \u03b1\u2010mannosidase II [13, 14, 15] as follows. A 15\u2010\u00b5L portion of each fraction was mixed with 135 \u00b5L of 0.89 mm 4\u2010metylumbelliferyl\u2010\u03b1\u2010d\u2010mannopyranoside (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan), 0.22\u00d7 NaCl/Pi, 0.11% Triton X\u2010100, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, and then 150 \u00b5L of 0.5 m glycine, 0.5 m Na2CO3 was added to stop the reaction. The intensity of fluorescence was measured by Fluorescence Spectrometer F\u20103000 (Hitachi) at the exciting wavelength of 364 nm and the emission wavelength of 448 nm.

A similar molar ratio was obtained when the total ER extract was subjected to the quantitative ELISA (Table 1), suggesting that a substantial fraction of fhx/P25 molecules which was not assembled into the elementary unit was retained in ER. This notion was supported by the fact that the lower molecular\u2010mass fraction of the ER extract (fractions25\u201332 in Fig. 1C) showed the molar ratio of H\u2010chain :L\u2010chain : fhx/P25 which was similar to that of the total ER extract (Table 1).",

The relative ratio of 30 : 27\u2010kDa forms of fhx/P25 in the purified elementary unit preparation from J\u2010139 was 69.3 (\u00b1 10.8) : 30.7 (\u00b1 10.8) (n = 5) as determined by densitometry after Western blotting. The purified 30\u2010kDa fhx/P25 from J\u2010139 was shown to be converted to the 27\u2010kDa form by digestion with the bacterial \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidase, which cleaves terminal \u03b11,2\u2010linked mannose residues in N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains. On the other hand, partially purified 27\u2010kDa fhx/P25 molecules from the three naked\u2010pupa mutants were unchanged by the same treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 1\u20134 and 5\u20138). These results suggest that the 30\u2010kDa fhx/P25 contains terminal \u03b11,2\u2010mannose residues in their N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains, whereas such mannose residues are absent in the 27\u2010kDa fhx/P25. The N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains were suggested to be retained in the 27\u2010kDa fhx/P25 of J\u2010139 because both 30\u2010 and 27\u2010kDa forms were converted to the 24\u2010kDa form by digestion with endo\u2010H (Fig. 2, lane 9). The presence of N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains in the 27\u2010kDa fhx/P25 molecules from the three naked\u2010pupa mutants was shown previously by their positive reactions to biotinylated Con A and their susceptibility to the endo\u2010H digestion [5].",

In order to confirm these observations, fhx/P25 was partially purified from cocoon shells, ER extract, or ER plus Golgi mixed extracts of the normal breed C108 and subjected to Western blotting with the anti\u2010fhx/P25 antibody or to the lectin blotting with biotinylated ConA before or after digestion with the bacterial \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidase or endo\u2010H (Fig. 3A). Fhx/P25 was detected as a 30\u2010kDa single band in the ER extract (Fig. 3A, lane 2) but as two bands (30 and 27 kDa) in the ER plus Golgi mixed extracts (Fig. 3A, lane 3) or in cocoons (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The 30\u2010kDa fhx/P25 was converted to the 27\u2010kDa single band by digestion with the bacterial \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidase (Fig. 3A, lanes 4\u20136), and the 30\u2010 and 27\u2010kDa fhx/P25 were converted to the 24\u2010kDa single band by digestion with endo\u2010H (Fig. 3A, left panel, lanes 7\u20139). The reaction of fhx/P25 with biotinylated ConA became undetectable after digestion with endo\u2010H (Fig. 3A, right panel, lanes 7\u20139). These results suggest that the 30\u2010kDa component is the ER form of fhx/P25 and the 27\u2010kDa component represents fhx/P25 whose N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains lost their terminal \u03b11,2\u2010mannose residues by digestion with \u03b11,2\u2010manosidases in Golgi complex, and further imply that fhx/P25 in the elementary unit of the normal\u2010level fibroin\u2010producing breeds is largely resistant to the action of \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidases in Golgi complex and secreted as the ER\u2010type 30\u2010kDa form.",

It has been shown that the assembly of oligomeric protein complexes occurs generally in ER [24] but some protein complexes, such as connexin 43 of gap junctions [25] and M protein of coronavirus [26], have been shown to be assembled in Golgi complex. In the case of silk fibroin, a vast amount of newly synthesized, high molecular\u2010mass (\u2248 350 kDa) fibrous H\u2010chain molecules in ER must be transported efficiently, without being denatured, to Golgi complex for secretion from PSG cells. The assembly of the elementary unit in ER is most likely a crucial event to meet the ER quality control [27] and to ensure the efficient intracellular transport and secretion of H\u2010chains.",

The clue to the first event has been obtained from studies [8] on the naked\u2010pupa mutants, Nd\u2010s and Nd\u2010s\nD\n. In these mutant silkworms, chimeric L\u2010chains are formed because of the exon\u2010shuffling mutation of the L\u2010chain gene. These chimeric L\u2010chains lack Cys172 which normally forms a disulfide bond with Cys\u2010c20 (the 20th residue from the C\u2010terminus) of the H\u2010chain. The free sulfhydryl group of Cys\u2010c20 on H\u2010chains seem to be harmful for the transport of the elementary unit from ER to Golgi, because (a) the level of fibroin secretion is less than 1% of the normal level, (b) ER is unusually enlarged in PSG cells, (c) the development of PSG is significantly retarded and (d) a thin, naked\u2010pupa\u2010type cocoons are formed in these mutants [7]. The present results that (a) the normal L\u2010chain is expressed (b) the normal elementary unit is assembled and (c) the Nd\u2010s\nD phenotypes with respect to the retardation of PSG development and the formation of thin cocoons were largely converted to the normal phenotypes in the L6 \u00d7 7 transgenic line expressing a significant level of the normal L\u2010chain strongly support the above notion.",

These results suggest that, although very inefficient in the absence of L\u2010chain, one molecule of fhx/P25 could associate noncovalently with six molecules of H\u2010chains. We demonstrated previously that N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 were important in maintaining the integrity of the elementary unit [1]. However, considering the facts that oligosaccharide chains play important roles in the assembly of vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein [28, 29], influenza virus hemagglutinin [30, 31], and IgM [32] in ER, a further role of N\u2010linked oligosacharide chains of fhx/P25 in the process of assembly of the elementary unit in ER may be speculated. With regard to this notion, the present finding that a relatively large amount of fhx/P25 molecules, i.e. about one third of molecular numbers of H\u2010chain and L\u2010chain (Table 1), exists in ER without being assembled into the elementary unit is interesting. This observation seems to be consistent with the previous observation that concentrations of fhx/P25 mRNA and H\u2010chain mRNA are roughly equimolar in PSG cells during the last intermolt stage [33]. The deduced sequence of fhx/P25 contains a typical signal peptide sequence at the N\u2010terminal region [34] and the sequence is cleaved at the N\u2010terminal side of Gly18 in the secreted fhx/P25 [1]. However, fhx/P25 does not contain the ER retention signal sequence [35] in its C\u2010terminal region. Thus, it could be speculated that the retention of fhx/P25 molecules which were not assembled into the elementary unit in ER might be attained by interaction with other ER\u2010resident proteins but the real reason remains to be elucidated.",

Subsequently L\u2010chains form a disulfide bond with Cys\u2010c20 of H\u2010chains, then assembly of the (H\u2010L)6fhx1 complex takes place.

As suggested from the deduced primary structure of fhx/P25 [2, 3], the presence of three N\u2010linked oligosaccharide chains per a molecule of fhx/P25 was demonstrated [1]. Furthermore, conversion of the 30\u2010kDa form of the purified or partially purified fhx/P25 to the 27\u2010kDa form was achieved by digestion with the bacterial \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidase (this study). We can calculate molecular masses of fhx/P25 containing different numbers of mannose residues as follows: 29.74 kDa for a molecule containing three chains of GlcNAc2Man9 and 27.58 kDa for a molecule containing three chains of GlcNAc2Man5, which are close to the 30\u2010 and 27\u2010kDa forms of fhx/P25, respectively.",

We suspect that the dynamic configuration of the isolated elementary unit is different from that during the intracellular transport or the size of the bacterial \u03b11,2\u2010mannosidase dimer (180 kDa \u00d7 2 = 360 kDa) employed [17] is too large to access the oligosaccharide chains of fhx/P25 which have been suggested to be located internally of the elementary unit [1].",
