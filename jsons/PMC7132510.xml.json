The goal of the ACA was to improve the quality of and access to health care by transforming insurance coverage and lowering health care costs. We have seen shifts in health care plans (i.e., account-based health plans) that have the consumers of the health care opting for lower monthly premiums with higher deductibles. These deductibles are often paid for by personal health savings accounts, thus pushing the costs of health care onto the individual consumer. Couple this with an unprecedented boom in technology, which in some cases can offer on-demand diagnostics within the time of an office visit, and the result is consumer-driven health care, particularly for those who can afford it. Despite recent administrative changes in Washington and the uncertainty of \u201crepeal and replace\u201d in the Republican agenda for the current ACA, the trend toward consumer-driven health care, with an emphasis on pre-budgeted spending, is likely to continue.",

Value-based care is defined as safe, appropriate, and effective care at a reasonable cost, which is predicated on evidence-based medicine and proven outcomes. Patients are looking for more pricing transparency and more options for efficient care delivery (i.e., telemedicine, retail care providers, and mobile health solutions). Health care providers are trying to better understand consumer wants and needs, measure performance, and improve the patient experience; this is a distinct change from the historical fee-for-service system that did little to incentivize providers to produce value.",

Emerging and re-emerging pathogens demand rapid responses at an unprecedented level. The skilled workforce continues to shrink, while the work demands go up. There are legislative influences on testing. At the same time, reimbursement and budgets are contracting. Yet still, at the end of the day, the laboratory is expected to produce quality results for improved patient care. Initiatives like antibiotic stewardship are helping to drive better outcomes with laboratory results, but many of these programs are dependent on post-analytical variables for the optimal impact on patient care to be realized [1, 2].",

Today, we have molecular point-of-care (mPOC) devices that can provide a rapid diagnostic answer within 20 minutes in a clinic, multiplex PCR sample-to-answer devices that can screen for >20 analytes in a single specimen in about an hour, high-volume automation that can enhance throughput and efficiency in the clinical microbiology laboratory with digital imaging, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) that can reveal a treasure trove of information in a single test. Combined, the changes in health care and technology have left many laboratories asking how to \u201cright-size technology\u201d for routine care while transforming practice. Ultimately, change will depend on the goals that are driving the conversion and utilization of the technology into daily laboratory practice. Factors may include syndrome-specific diagnostic needs, ease of use, the need for rapid results, improved sensitivity and specificity, operational needs (such as staffing and expertise), laboratory design (such as centralized versus decentralized models), cost, consumer demand, and the potential for improved patient outcomes. The laboratory must weigh all these factors while trying to make a business case to improve service despite the fact that there are few or no outcome data available to support the use of new technology.",

While consumer choice can help push innovation, one also has to wonder to what extent the market will allow the significant increases in testing costs that can come with technology. For example, in the case of acute gastroenteritis which is typically a self-limiting infection with the majority of specimens coming from an outpatient setting, traditionally a stool culture would be ordered that would cost a patient less than $100. The newer multiplex stool PCR panels can result in a charge that can cost a patient over $1,000. Will patients be willing to bear paying this increased cost for such a diagnostic test long term? While one can agree that there is improved turnaround time, sensitivity and pathogen coverage in a sophisticated multiplex diagnostic assay, it must be used in conjunction with diagnostic algorithms that prevent needless additional downstream testing as well as excess costs. Clearly, there is a need for diagnostic stewardship alongside antibiotic stewardship to improve quality and the prudent use of health care dollars.

The outcome of right-sizing is to provide results with the potential to inform therapeutic and infection control decisions for improved care and, ultimately, reduced downstream costs. The diagnostic testing needs of a medical institution such as Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, which is comprised of 21 hospitals and over 200 medical offices spread out over a wide geographical area with over 3.5 million members and serviced by a central laboratory, are significantly different than those of a 500-bed county hospital with an on-site laboratory. Advances in technology have provided flexibility in diagnostic testing to address the differing needs of health care systems and the laboratories that serve them. For any given analyte, there are a number of highly sensitive and specific tests available from which to choose. Considerations that go into the selection of a test or instrument platform for implementation include perceived turnaround time needs for improved patient care, sample volume requirements, number of tests expected, suitability for the intended laboratory based on available expertise and desired workflow, as well as cost.",

Such mPOC tests have evolved for more practical use at the bedside. Manufacturers have appreciably simplified tests by removing the need for sample manipulation and handling. Instrumentation has become more automated and/or involves fully integrated systems that are portable or significantly smaller and more modular. Instruments have also incorporated mechanisms for recording and transmitting results. All the while, tests have become faster while demonstrating improved sensitivity and specificity [3]. These modifications in technology have enabled molecular testing to migrate from large central laboratories. Most POC tests are still moderately complex, which is defined by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as one requiring basic laboratory knowledge and training for personnel performing the test. Users of these tests must adhere to CLIA regulatory requirements, which includes quality assurance, along with appropriate documentation, validation of analytical performance, proficiency testing, and ongoing competency training. CLIA director oversight is still required [4].",

Based on this definition, non-laboratorians can perform the test without CLIA director oversight if they are following the manufacturer's instructions [4]. The first CLIA-waived mPOC test to receive FDA approval was the Alere i Influenza A&B in 2015. To better ensure quality results are being reported, some of the new mPOC tests have incorporated internal electronic and reagent quality control (QC) and have built in a shut-down mechanism in the event of failed QC. Since the waived testing program began in 1992, the number of approved CLIA-waived diagnostics has increased from 9 to over 100, with more than 20 analytes approved for infectious disease testing [6]. There are over 200,000 laboratories in the United States that now hold a certificate of waiver, which enables them to perform any CLIA-waived test [4].",

Few non-laboratorians realize that the central laboratory filters out many inappropriate specimens, and non-laboratorians require extensive training to understand the testing complexities of even waived tests. Laboratories frequently receive incorrectly collected specimens and are asked to test them because there is a lack of appreciation of why these specimens would not be tested. For example, Clostridium difficile testing is not performed on a formed stool specimen or for patients less than 1 year old due to the confounding issues of potential colonization, and as in a central laboratory, pre-analytical knowledge and conditions would need to exist to prevent misuse of testing. One question is whether we would be needlessly treating people in these cases if left to the facility performing the waived testing. Also, testing a specimen type that is not included in the intended use of an FDA cleared test will result in an off-label use of an assay.",

The study determined that of the 1,356 patients, 26.2% were unwilling to wait even 20 minutes for the results of an mPOC test. Based on the results from a questionnaire, of 129 patients who tested positive by a NAAT, use of a 20-minute mPOC test would have resulted in immediate treatment of 71.9% of the individuals, whereas a 90-minute test would have influenced the immediate treatment time of only 3.1% of these positive patients. Of 1,227 patients who tested negative for CT/NG by NAAT, use of a 20-minute mPOC test would have prevented 3.2% of empirical treatments, while a 90-minute mPOC test would have prevented 0.3% of the empirical treatments.",

These multiplex tests detect most common and some uncommon pathogens associated with a syndrome based on similar signs and symptoms. In 2008, the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel was the first multiplex molecular panel to receive FDA clearance in the United States. Since then, a number of large syndromic multiplex panels have been FDA cleared for use in clinical diagnostics. Multiplex panels currently exist for gastroenteritis (gastrointestinal [GI]), bloodstream infections, and meningitis/encephalitis. Although some instrument platforms still require offline extraction, many platforms have evolved into sample-to-result assays requiring less than 5 minutes of hands-on time with a turnaround time of 1 to 2 hours. For the most part, the sensitivity and specificity of these multiplex tests are comparable; however, sensitivity and specificity of the individual targets can vary by platform. Multiplexed molecular panels that can target up to 27 pathogens have the potential to simplify ordering for the physician, as well as workflow in the laboratory, and require less expertise on both ends as a single automated test. As new faster and simpler technologies are introduced for multiplexed platforms, there has been continued growth in adoption of these tests for clinical diagnosis. However, there are limitations to this shotgun approach that are associated with high financial costs as reimbursements continue to decrease, as well as test interpretation dilemmas, especially in the context of low prevalence rates.",

On the other end of the spectrum, another recent article reported that the meningitis panel demonstrated reduced sensitivity for HSV detection from pediatric cerebrospinal fluid specimens [29].

The LCD proposed coverage for molecular panels to detect GI pathogens would be limited to 5 targets (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli), which represent the majority of foodborne pathogens. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for infectious diarrhea suggest a selective approach to workup based on whether the patient has traveler's diarrhea with fever or blood, hospital-acquired diarrhea, or persistent diarrhea [34].

Today with total laboratory automation (TLA) and digital microbiology, laboratories have the capability to read and review slides and plates from facilities that are miles or oceans away. A recent Clinical Microbiology Newsletter article highlighted the impact of telemedicine on Gram stains in the health care system in Arizona [35]. Telemedicine companies like VSee (www.VSee.com) have set up field kits with multiple devices that enable remote diagnosis. Through the use of software like eHealth Opinion, rural patients and physician experts in the U.S. and China are connected through the Virtual Doctor Project [36]. Such projects are expanding in many parts of the developing world [37].

There are currently FDA-approved CT/NG NAAT assays for self-collected specimens in clinical settings. Internet-based mail-in programs for sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening has been successfully implemented in a public health system (www.iwantthekit.com), as well as through private companies (mylabbox.com) [38]. Public Health England in 2015 published a guidance document on commissioning an Internet-based Chlamydia screening program [39]. Such strategies are aimed at diagnostic testing and improving access over the continuum of care. With this new way of delivering care comes the question of validating at-home self-collected specimens and the stability of a specimen mailed through the post. While STI programs may be a starting point for specimen self-collection, it begins a conversation that would expand the realm of consumerism in health care to a new level. One could argue that no one is better able to properly collect a specimen than the person with the greatest interest in the results, the patient. Clinical studies comparing clinician-collected and self-collected specimens in a clinical setting for CT/NG have demonstrated that self-collected vaginal specimens have equivalent performance with acceptable patient satisfaction [40, 41]. For a recent review of self-collected specimens for infectious disease testing, see Tenover et al. [42].",

Barriers are bioinformatics, interoperability of results, and building a workforce with a new skill set and infrastructure to support it. Given the debate around reimbursement and multiplex panels, it will be interesting to see where the conversation leads with NGS. NGS will provide much more information than a 20-plex respiratory or stool panel.

The specific objectives of PulseNet are to detect foodborne disease case clusters through comparison of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) \u201cfingerprint\u201d patterns, to facilitate early identification of common-source outbreaks, and to help food regulatory agencies identify areas where implementation of new measures is likely to improve the safety of the food supply. At the time, PFGE was considered cutting-edge technology. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of PusleNET, the economic impact of the program was recently published [47]. PulseNet costs roughly $7.3 million to operate but saves more than $500 million annually in medical and productivity costs avoided [47]. This ROI is impressive, but the fact that it was 20 years before this economic analysis was published is surprising given the program's success. With federal budget cuts to critical programs that support national infrastructure, evaluating and communicating the value of technology to the health economics of the nation should be part of the national strategy. Looking ahead, it is clear that it is only a matter of time before PFGE will be replaced by NGS for such foodborne outbreak investigations in the PulseNET system. The economic impact of NGS should be analyzed in a timely manner so that the ROI of this powerful technology can be communicated to the appropriate funding agencies.",

            "text": "The same is true for the clinical microbiology laboratory. While it sounds very appealing to place an mPOC influenza virus platform nearer to the patient in the ED or in urgent care, the initial investment to place and maintain that testing may be a daunting sell to administrators. The question around this ROI is where the cost avoidance is over the continuum of care. For patients coming through the ED during influenza season the greatest impact to patient management would be avoiding a hospital admission. The average cost of a hospital admission due to pneumonia is $14,143, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Rockville, MD) [48]. Compared to the cost of a Tamiflu prescription, which is roughly $100, the avoidance of hospital admission would clearly have the greatest financial impact. When one adds the implementation costs of the mPOC instrument and reagents over the course of a flu season, the ROI can become a more comprehensive sell to the C-suite or the corporation's senior executives. Table 1, Table 2, Table 3\ndemonstrate the estimated cost of implementing an mPOC influenza assay in a hospital system with 14 medical centers, each with an ED. The total cost of implementation for instrument and reagents over 3 months of the respiratory disease season adds up to $420,00 (Table 1). The number of admissions that would need to be avoided to break even on the cost of implementation is 30, or roughly 2 per ED (Table 2). This number is equal to 0.5% of the estimated 6,000 tested patients over the course of the respiratory disease season, which would equate to an ROI of <3 months (Table 3). Another factor to consider when thinking about a rapid mPOC test is that placing testing correctly in the system may actually be cost neutral, because testing is being shifted without the need to bring on any additional testing. Outcome studies looking at technology placement are forthcoming [9].",
