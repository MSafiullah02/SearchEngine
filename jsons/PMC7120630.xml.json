            "text": "The inflammatory response caused by CPB also has direct negative cardiac effects. The inflammatory state caused by CPB involves platelet\u2013endothelial cell interactions and vasospastic responses resulting in low-flow states in the coronary circulation.13 The anaphylatoxin C5a is a potent molecule that is spasmogenic and has leukocyte-activating properties that cause degranulation and release of toxic oxygen free radicals. The complement-exposed leukocytes are attracted to adhere to the vascular endothelium and to aggregate, resulting in margination in blood vessels and leukoembolization. These inflammatory cells mediate injury by increasing their production and releasing oxygen free radicals or proteolytic enzymes.14 It is this release of oxygen free radicals that is generally accepted as the cause for transient postoperative ventricular dysfunction that manifests itself about 2 h after cessation of CPB and is at its worse at 4\u20135 h after CPB.15,16 Recovery of ventricular function begins in 8\u201310 h and full recovery usually occurs by 24\u201348 h.16 The systemic vascular resistance rises as ventricular function worsens. This is a compensatory mechanism in an effort to maintain systemic blood pressure and perfusion in the face of depressed ventricular contractility. The oxygen free radicals and the proteolytic enzymes released by the neutrophils also damage endothelial cells increasing capillary permeability resulting in capillary leak during this period.17 The capillary leak may last from 1 to 2 days and is related to the duration of CPB. Hypothermia has multiple adverse effects on the postoperative open-heart patient. Regarding the circulatory status, it predisposes cardiac dysrhythmias, increases SVR, precipitates shivering and impairs coagulation.18 It also indirectly decreases cardiac output by increasing vasoconstriction and causing bradycardia. As a consequence of the inflammatory state after CPB, the postoperative open-heart patient is in a unique physiologic state where rules applicable to other physiologic situations may not apply, and a failure to recognize this concept results in management errors. Concerns about the short- and long-term effects of CPB has generated the recent concept of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. While there seems to be growing evidence that this off-pump approach to the surgical management of ischemic heart disease is advantageous, there does remain some debate.19 Despite the movement toward avoidance of CPB in selected patients with ischemic heart disease, the majority of these patients as well as virtually all patients with valvular heart disease are operated on using CPB. The CPB circuit is not the only factor responsible for this altered physiologic state. The time of ischemia and reperfusion, hypothermia, hypotension with nonpulsatile flow, altered coagulation, and the administration of blood and products are other factors contributing to the altered postoperative physiologic state.20\n",

The most common causes of LCO after surgery are related to decreased left ventricular preload caused by hypovolemia and bleeding, vasodilatation, rewarming, drugs, cardiac tamponade, right ventricular dysfunction, positive pressure ventilation, and a tension pneumothorax. Increased afterload is usually the result of acute vasoconstriction most often related to vasoactive drug therapy. It can also be from preexisting hypertension, pain or awareness, fluid overload, or hypothermia. Decreased contractility is causative of LCO in patients with preexisting LV dysfunction in association with perioperative ischemia. Perioperative ischemia is usually a consequence of poor intraoperative myocardial protection, incomplete revascularization, coronary artery or conduit spasm, coronary artery \u201ctrash\u201d syndrome, graft closure, acute anemia, hypoxia, or acidosis of any etiology. Tachyarrhythmias adversely affect cardiac output by decreasing cardiac filling time and subsequently decreasing stroke volume coronary perfusion time. Tachyarrhythmias also increase myocardial oxygen demand. Bradyarrhythmias depresses cardiac output, especially when left ventricular dysfunction limits the compensatory mechanism of an increasing stroke volume. Bradyarrhythmias are particularly deleterious in association with aortic insufficiency of any degree. When atrial fibrillation occurs, there is a loss of atrial contribution to cardiac output and subsequent fall in the cardiac output.

The early clinical manifestations of LCO are apparent to the clinician with a heightened suspicion for their presence. The importance of a careful bedside assessment cannot be overstated. The examination should include the condition and appearance of skin and mucous membranes, breath sounds, murmurs, temperature of extremities, and a level of consciousness. The EKG monitor is a minimum level of monitoring after open-heart surgery. It is a screening device for ischemia and arrhythmias, both causes of LCO. All ischemic changes on monitors must be further assessed with a 12-lead EKG and it is prudent to confirm all but the most obvious arrhythmias with a 12-lead EKG. Hemodynamic monitoring, at a minimum, includes a central venous pressure (CVP) line and can be used to assess preload as well as right ventricular function. Clinical LCO and low CVP suggests inadequate preload as the cause of LCO. Clinical LCO and an elevated CVP are more complicated. This situation may be the result of right heart failure, volume overload, left heart failure, tamponade, or some preexisting problem such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this circumstance, the information from a Swan\u2013Ganz catheter or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can clarify the situation. Swan\u2013Ganz catheters (pulmonary artery catheters) are used in all patients in some institutions and selectively in others. Oximetric Swan\u2013Ganz catheters are optional and are used in highly selected situations when minute-to-minute cardiac assessments are necessary. Swan\u2013Ganz catheters provide an assessment of right and left heart filling pressures, determine cardiac output, stroke volume, SVR, and SvO2. The information acquired from these catheters confirm the diagnosis of clinical LCO and provide information as to the etiology. For example, low filling pressures suggest preload as the causative factor, whereas high filling pressures indicate a problem with contractility or afterload. A Chest X-ray is a valuable and essential tool in the postoperative period for multiple reasons, but it can also assess the lungs as a cause for low cardiac output. In particular, a chest X-ray can identify a pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and the endotracheal tube position as potential causes of a low cardiac output. It also assesses the mediastinum for an enlarged mediastinal silhouette suggesting tamponade or incorrect position of intrathoracic monitoring lines.",

Despite its ability to increase urine production in some instances, it has never been shown to prevent acute renal failure.40,41 At doses of 2\u20133 mcg/kg/min, the main effects are renal as described, although there can be a mild \u03b22 effect with a decrease in SVR and systemic blood pressure. At doses of 3\u20138 mcg/kg/min, \u03b21 effects are predominant increasing contractility. At this dose, there is also a chronotropic effect that increases heart rate and has the potential for arrhythmogenesis. Doses of dopamine of greater than 8 mcg/kg/min results in increasing inotropy, but also this dose causes a predominant \u03b1 effect. This \u03b1 effect occurs directly but also indirectly from the release of norepinephrine. The SVR increases as do the filling pressures and myocardial oxygen consumption leading to ventricular dysfunction. These adverse effects can be somewhat mitigated by the concomitant use of vasodilator therapy. Its use may be limited by profound tachycardia even at low doses and excessive urine production. Dopamine is begun as an infusion at 2.5 mcg/kg/min and titrated to 10\u201320 mcg/kg/min if needed. If a \u03b21 favorable response is not achieved at 10 mcg/kg/min, it is unlikely that higher doses will result in hemodynamic improvement.",

Dobutamine has mild \u03b22 effect and decreases SVR; this effect is mild and may be offset by its mild \u03b11 vasoconstricting effect present in some specific circumstances.43 Also, unlike dopamine, dobutamine reduces ventricular wall tension by reducing afterload and preload particularly in the presence of volume overload.44,45 There appears to be augmentation of myocardial blood flow and an improvement of the myocardial oxygen supply and demand curve, but this positive effect may be lessened by tachycardia.42 The usefulness of dobutamine may be limited by tachycardia that may be profound and may trigger atrial fibrillation. Because of its hypotension from the vasodilating effect, dobutamine should be used with caution in the hypotensive or hypovolemic patient and is contraindicated if tamponade is suspected. It is most commonly used for low cardiac output associated with a mildly elevated SVR and may have a synergistic effect when used with PDE inhibitors. It does have a moderate pulmonary vasodilatory effect and can improve RV dysfunction. It is more expensive than dopamine, yet only minimally more effective.

They are usually employed when first-line agents like dopamine or epinephrine are not providing adequate hemodynamic improvement or if side effects are limiting their effectiveness. However, there is evidence that administering these agents preemptively, prior to separation from cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with preoperative LV dysfunction, may eliminate the need for inotropic therapy subsequently.52,53 Inamrinone and milrinone are particularly useful in patients with RV dysfunction secondary to pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated PVR. These agents are also useful in treating diastolic dysfunction as they have been shown to have relaxant or lusitropic properties. They also appear to have direct vasorelaxant effects on arterial graft conduits and may be useful in patients with evidence of internal mammary spasm or in the presence of radial artery grafts.54,55 These drugs have a relatively long half-life of 2\u20134 h; consequently, the loading dose will be effective for several hours after administration but the patient should be reassessed at that time for any ongoing need for therapy. Since the PDE-inhibitors are effective vasodilators, the systemic blood pressure may require support, usually with \u03b1 agonists. Vasopressin may be an alternative drug to support the systemic blood pressure while reducing the need for catecholamine pressors.56 Inamrinone is associated with thrombocytopenia, but this is rare with milrinone.

It has two sites of action: kidney and blood vessels. The primary function of arginine vasopressin (AVP) is to regulate extracellular fluid volume by affecting renal tubular absorption of water. It acts on the renal collecting tubules by increasing water permeability and results in decreased urine formation. This is its antidiuretic function and is why it is commonly known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The antidiuretic effect increases blood volume and indirectly increases cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. A secondary function of AVP is vasoconstriction. It binds to vascular smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction. AVP is a potent vasopressor even in patients with catecholamine-resistant hypotension. Loss of catecholamine pressor effect is a well-established phenomenon.63 In acute shock states, vasopressin levels increase rapidly and then decrease in prolonged shock states leading to a relative deficiency of vasopressin.64,65 The deficiency of vasopressin is thought to contribute to hypotension refractory to catecholamines, especially in sepsis.65,66 Because vasopressin is a potent vasopressor, infusions of vasopressin leads to improved organ perfusion, increased mean arterial pressure, and improved neurological function.63,65,67 Vasopressin is indicated for the management of severe vasodilatory shock. In patients with \u201cvasoplegia,\u201d profound peripheral vasodilatation with preserved cardiac output, vasopressin may have a role. This condition is usually associated with patients on preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or amiodarone. It may also be the consequence of leukocyte activation and release of proinflammatory mediators caused by the systemic inflammatory response to CPB.68,69 Vasopressin is usually successful in reversing the low SVR when phenylephrine and norepinephrine are not.68,70 Vasodilatory shock is not \u00aduncommon in patients with a ventricular assist devices (VAD) and may benefit from the vasoconstrictive actions of vasopressin.71 Despite vasopressin\u2019s effect in vasodilatory shock, it remains a second-line agent because there is no current evidence to support the use of vasopressin as a first-line agent instead of catecholamines.72 There is growing evidence that vasopressin may provide comparable or superior efficacy to epinephrine as a resuscitative agent for cardiac arrest and hemodynamic collapse when administered as a single bolus of 40 units intravenously.73 The recommended infusion rate for vasopressin in the treatment of vasodilatory shock is 0.01\u20130.04 units/min. Doses greater that 0.04 units/min may lead to cardiac arrest.64 Rapid rebound hypotension commonly occurs after vasopressin infusion is discontinued.74 Potential adverse sequelae of vasopressin therapy include ischemic cutaneous necrosis, intestinal ischemia, and decreased hepatosplanchnic flow and cardiac output.75\n",

The hemodynamic effects of calcium chloride are more profound if the patient is hypocalcemic. Serum ionized calcium levels are low postoperatively, particularly just prior to weaning from CPB, and a bolus of calcium is frequently given just prior to weaning from CPB. The effect of a bolus of calcium is increased contractility and increased SVR. It has little effect on the heart rate. It is more effective when the patient is hypocalcemic, but is also efficacious even if the patient is normocalcemic. Calcium chloride provides ionized calcium, which acts as a strong but very evanescent inotrope. A continuous infusion of calcium does not sustain its hemodynamic effect. Ionized calcium is necessary for the effective action of catecholamines. The main indication for calcium chloride is at the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass to augment systemic blood pressure during separation from bypass. It is also used as an emergency resuscitation agent to support hemodynamics until a more complete evaluation can be performed and more specific measures utilized.

Unlike most inotropic agents, it provides hemodynamic support to the failing heart by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and improving coronary artery perfusion. IABP counterpulsation acts to improve the myocardial oxygen supply:demand ratio. It reduces the impedance of left ventricular ejection by rapidly deflating just before systole, thus unloading the LV, and in this way decreases myocardial oxygen demand. As it rapidly inflates just after aortic valve closure, it increases the diastolic coronary perfusion and improves myocardial oxygen supply. The survival rate of patients requiring postoperative IABP support is 60\u201370%.88,89 The indications for IABP counterpulsation are perioperative ischemia, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction (such as acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, and cardiogenic shock), postoperative low cardiac output states not responsive to moderate doses of inotropic agents, and for the acute deterioration of myocardial function to provide temporary support or a bridge to transplantation.

The percutaneous approach is favored despite its somewhat higher prevalence of vascular complications.90 Percutaneous insertion is preferred because of ease of insertion and removal. The IABP is inserted percutaneously using the Seldinger technique and is positioned fluoroscopically. The balloon tip marker should be positioned just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The surgical insertion requires the exposure of the femoral artery and creation of a sidearm to the femoral artery with a vascular graft, followed by the insertion of the balloon through the graft. An alternative open surgical approach is exposure of the femoral artery and then direct cannulation with a vascular sheath using a guide wire. A hemostatic suture is placed in the femoral artery around the stem of the IABP. The IABP can be inserted by an open supra-inguinal approach in cases of severe femoral arterial disease, or the transthoracic approach via the ascending aorta in cases of severe aortoiliac peripheral disease. Triggering of the device is timed using EKG or arterial waveform. If EKG is used, the inflation is set at the peak of T wave, the end of systole. Deflation is set just before or on the P wave. Arterial waveform triggering is more reliable and a better timing technique when outside electrical impulses (i.e., pacemaker, electrocautery) may interfere with interpretation of the EKG signal. With arterial triggering, the inflation should occur at the dicrotic notch and deflation just before the onset of the aortic upstroke. Proper timing will show an arterial waveform with augmentation of the diastolic portion of the curve.",

There is often immediate hemodynamic improvement and the patient requires less inotropic support. When the required inotropic support reaches moderate levels (generally half the doses required prior to IABP support) consideration for weaning is possible. The IABP is weaned by reducing the assist ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 or less depending on the system. The weaning process can usually begin after 12\u201324 h of support and completed by 24\u201348 h. If the device was placed percutaneously, it can be removed similarly with firm pressure to the groin for 30 min. Since the arterial puncture site is several centimeters proximal to the skin insertion site, a common mistake is to direct the pressure at the skin insertion site instead of the arterial puncture site. When this error occurs, a large hematoma develops in the groin proximally. If a hematoma occurs or if the perfusion to the distal limb is compromised, immediate exploration is required.91\n",

Rapid heart rates, usually atrial fibrillation with ventricular responses greater than 150 bpm, interfere with the balloon\u2019s ability to inflate and deflate. In this circumstance, augmentation can be achieved by changing the triggering ratio to 1:2 (one IABP cycle for every second cardiac cycle). Inadequate gas volume in the balloon can also result in an inability to augment. Volume loss from the balloon can result from a gas leak or from failure of the balloon to unwrap. Either circumstance necessitates the removal of the balloon. Of more immediate concern is a balloon rupture. This is heralded by blood in the balloon tubing. The balloon must be removed immediately as helium and blood can create a rock-hard thrombus making surgical removal necessary.",

The most catastrophic complication is an aortic or iliac artery dissection or rupture. Fortunately, this is an uncommon occurrence. Equally catastrophic is paraplegia from a periadventitial aortic hematoma or as the consequence of embolization of atherosclerotic debris to the spinal cord. Embolization or altered perfusion to visceral vessels can also occur with IABP counterpulsation. The most common vessels involved are the renal arteries. This usually occurs in the presence of significant atherosclerotic disease in the aorta. Altered perfusion of the kidneys and renal failure can happen if the balloon is situated below diaphragm.92 The IABP can also restrict perfusion to the LIMA if it is advanced too far proximally into the subclavian artery.93 Distal limb ischemia is the most common complication of the IABP. The occurrence rate is 5\u201310% and occurs more commonly with percutaneous placement, in women, and in patients with small femoral arteries. Heparin therapy is advisable if the IABP is in place more than 2\u20133 days after surgery. The management of compromised distal perfusion begins by knowing the preoperative vascular status of the patient as well as obtaining a baseline status of the distal extremities with physical examination and Doppler assessment as soon as possible after implantation of the IABP. Thereafter, the distal pulses or Doppler signals should be assessed hourly and recorded along with the vital signs of the patient. If the pulses or Doppler signals deteriorate, initially rule out peripheral vasoconstriction from hypothermia, low cardiac output, or as a result of vasopressor agents. If limb ischemia persists, remove the sheath from the femoral artery if the IABP was inserted percutaneously. If distal perfusion remains compromised, then remove the balloon and place it on the contralateral side if counterpulsation remains necessary. Femoral artery exploration is necessary if IABP removal does not improve the vascular integrity of the threatened limb. If the patient remains dependent on the IABP and the femoral artery approach is not feasible any longer, consider the transthoracic approach.",

They are the ultimate therapy for low cardiac output. They are usually employed intraoperatively for failure to wean from cardiopulmonary, but can also be an option postoperatively if the patient fails to respond to vasoactive agents and the IABP. VADs should be considered if the patient does not respond to maximum medical therapy including the IABP.95,96 The therapeutic strategy of VADs is to provide sufficient flow to support the systemic and/or pulmonary circulation while the myocardium recovers. Short-term devices are used if there is a reasonable chance for recovery, whereas long-term devices are considered if the chances of recovery are remote and the patient is a suitable candidate for transplantation. Prior to committing to circulatory assist, a thorough investigation for correctable causes of LCO must be made. Transesophageal echocardiography is helpful in evaluating ventricular wall motion and excluding other structural conditions related to the cardiac procedure. Preload and afterload should be optimized, appropriate inotropic therapy instituted, and placement of the IABP accomplished before considering circulatory assist.91 Circulatory assist can be left or right heart bypass or combined biventricular bypass. The general indications for VAD implantation include a complete and adequate cardiac surgical procedure, the correction of all metabolic problems, the inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass, the inability to reverse deteriorating hemodynamic embarrassment despite maximum drug therapy and IABP, and a cardiac index less than 1.8\u20132 L/min/m2.22\n",

The LVAD flow is dependent on the intravascular volume and right ventricular function. The goal of management is a LVAD flow of 2.2 L/min/m2. These devices reduce left ventricular wall stress by 80% and left ventricular myocardial oxygen demand by 40%. Monitoring mixed venous oxygen saturation can assess adequacy of tissue perfusion. After LVAD implantation, inotropic support should be discontinued to decrease myocardial oxygen demand. In some circumstances, an inotrope may be needed to support the right ventricle and vasoconstricting agents may be needed to maintain the SVR and a mean arterial pressure greater than 75 mmHg. Heparin therapy is necessary after postoperative bleeding stops and, particularly, when flow is decreased to less than 1.5 L/min. After 48 h of support, a TEE should be performed to assess the LV function. As the LVAD is weaned, a low-dose inotrope may be needed. Fifty percent of patients can be weaned successfully from LVAD and 25\u201330% survive to be discharged.

Indications for an RVAD include the general indications for VADs as well as a right atrial pressure greater than 20 mmHg, left atrial pressure less than 15 mmHg, and no tricuspid regurgitation.

Impaired RVAD support may be the result of hypovolemia or inadequate cannula drainage. During RVAD support, if the patient becomes hypotensive it may be the result of hypovolemia, left ventricular dysfunction, or a decreased systemic vascular resistance.

In circumstances of compromised cardiac and pulmonary function, cardiopulmonary function support is also required. Cardiopulmonary support (CPS) is accomplished with a portable centrifugal pump, membrane oxygenator, heat exchanger, and heparin-coated tubing. This system is generally referred to as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Indications for ECMO or CPS are those of VADs in association with impaired oxygenation. ECMO can also be used for cath lab catastrophes or in support of high-risk angioplasty.101,102 Only two cannulae are required for ECMO/CPS support, a venous drainage cannula and arterial perfusion cannula. If the sternum is open, the cannulation technique is the right atrium and aorta. The percutaneous cannulation can also be used using the common femoral artery and vein or the jugular vein. Since this system does not completely divert all the blood from the LV (pulmonary venous return to the LV persists), the LV is not completely decompressed, and a beating heart and competent aortic valve is necessary. An IABP is frequently concomitantly used to provide augmented pulsatile coronary perfusion.103 The management of the patient on ECMO/CPS is complicated and labor intensive. It requires an experienced, committed, and well-trained staff. Preload must be optimized and the SVR may need support with \u03b1-agonist agents or vasopressin. Pulmonary artery hypertension must be controlled and may require using inhaled nitrous oxide. If renal failure occurs, consider early continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Ventilation with low tidal volumes is helpful.22 Heparin-coated tubing may eliminate the need for full anticoagulation, but heparin anticoagulation is required to prevent excess fibrin formation in the oxygenator membrane. The activated clotting time (ACT) is maintained 160 s by continuous heparin infusion.91 The results of ECMO/CPS depend on the degree of organ dysfunction at the time of initiation and the indication for its use. If it was instituted for cardiac arrest, the survival is 31%.104 Of those patients placed on ECMO/CPS for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, 40\u201350% will die on support and only half of those who do not will survive the hospitalization.

There are short-term devices and long-term devices.107 The short-term devices are non-implantable and employed if recovery of ventricular function is expected. The long-term devices function as bridges to transplant and may be a long-term alternative to transplant. These devices are pulsatile, implantable, and provide total support of circulation. The selection of a long-term support device is rarely a consideration in the acute care management of the postoperative open-heart patient. However, a working understanding of the short-term devices may be required in the management of the postoperative patient with low cardiac output. The complications of these devices include mediastinal bleeding, mediastinal sepsis, thromboembolic events, renal failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, respiratory failure, refractory systemic vasodilatation, and immunocompromise.",

            "text": "This is a very common postoperative occurrence. It usually occurs with rewarming and responds well to volume expansion. If hypotension persists despite volume expansion, or if presenting hypotension is severe, consider temporizing with a vasopressor such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine. The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output/index must be followed closely when using either drug. The hemodynamic effects of phenylephrine are purely \u03b1-adrenergic and act to increase the systemic vascular resistance. It has no cardiac effects. The indirect cardiac effects include a decrease in cardiac output caused by an increasing afterload as well as a potential increase in the cardiac output by raising perfusion pressure in coronary arteries. Patients may become refractory to the therapeutic effects of phenylephrine after several hours and may require a change to norepinephrine. The starting dose of phenylephrine is 5 mcg/min and increase to effect up to 500 mcg/min, with the usual dosage range of 0.05\u20131.5 mcg/kg/min. If there is inadequate therapeutic response to phenylephrine, switching to norepinephrine may prove effective. Norepinephrine has powerful \u03b1-adrenergic properties and some weaker \u03b2-adrenergic effects. The \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation will increase the systemic blood pressure by increasing the SVR. The \u03b2-adrenergic effects will increase contractility and heart rate. Clinically, the \u03b1-adrenergic effects predominate and will increase myocardial oxygen demand and may cause a fall in cardiac output despite its \u03b2-adrenergic effect on contractility. The vasoconstrictive effects of norepinephrine may increase organ perfusion pressure but decrease absolute blood flow and result in visceral ischemia; this is an important potential adverse effect of this agent. The initial dose of norepinephrine is 1 mcg/min (0.015 mcg/kg/min) and titrate to effect. Recall that at doses greater than 20 mcg/min (0.2 mcg/kg/min), visceral and peripheral perfusion is reduced to such an extent the patient may become acidotic.",

The usual criterion for pharmacologic treatment is a mean arterial pressure 10% above the upper level of the normal patient-specific mean arterial pressure (MAP), usually greater than 96 mmHg, or arbitrarily, a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg (MAP greater than 110 mmHg). In managing the postoperative hypertensive patient, a few caveats are important to keep in mind. First, a patient with a history of longstanding hypertension or critical carotid stenosis may require a higher perfusion pressure to maintain adequate cerebral and renal perfusion. Secondly, a patient with a tenuous aorta or thin-walled vein grafts may require a lower pressure to avoid suture line dehiscence and catastrophic hemorrhage.",

When it is, it is the result of poor intraoperative protection or a right ventricular infarct. More commonly, it is associated with pulmonary artery hypertension, either preexisting or the result of infused vasoconstricting adrenergic agents, administration of blood products, a type III protamine reaction, hypoxemia, acidosis, or a tension pneumothorax. The hemodynamic hallmark of RV failure is a central venous pressure (CVP) higher than the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). TEE is an excellent mode of RV assessment and diagnosis of RV failure.119 The treatment of RV dysfunction begins by optimizing preload to a CVP of 18\u201320 mmHg. Pushing the CVP higher may result in RV dilatation and exacerbation of RV dysfunction. Also, a distended RV can have an adverse effect on the LV by shifting the intraventricular septum into the LV and impairing LV filling and stoke volume. Hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis must be corrected as these adversely affect RV function. There must be active transport of volume from the right atrium to the RV, so it is imperative that atrioventricular (AV) conduction be maintained or established using sequential AV pacing if necessary. The addition of inotropic support is often necessary. Inotropes that support biventricular function and are pulmonary vasodilators should be selected. The phosphodiesterase inhibitors are reasonable agents, but their action on the SVR may necessitate the use of \u03b1-adrenergic agents and lead to further vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature. Isoproterenol may improve RV contractility, but its proarrhythmic effects may not be well tolerated.",

The pulmonary vasodilators have no direct effect on RV or LV inotropy. Their effect is indirect by afterload reduction of the RV. Nesiritide (see prior description) is a synthetic \u03b2-type natriuretic peptide that reduces pulmonary artery pressure and unloads the RV. It also has vasodilatory effects on the SVR and renal arterioles resulting in improved cardiac output and a synergistic effect with loop diuretics.120,121\nInhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and decreases RV afterload. This results in enhanced RV performance. It has little, if any, effect on the SVR.122 Inhaled nitric oxide is administered through a ventilator circuit designed to mix O2 and NO. This generates a low level of NO2, which must be monitored as it is toxic to lung parenchymal tissue. Inhaled nitric oxide is quite effective, but it is cumbersome and expensive. The usual dose is 10\u201340 ppm administered through a ventilator circuit. Prostaglandin E\n1 and its analogs, epoprostenol and iloprost, are potent pulmonary vasodilators effective in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. These agents are most frequently used in cardiac transplantation, but have been used effectively after mitral valve surgery.58,123,124\n",

In the postoperative period, it results in LCO with normal or elevated filling pressures in patients with normal or hyperdynamic LV function. It is commonly seen in small women with left ventricular hypertrophy from hypertensive cardiovascular disease or aortic stenosis. Severe diastolic dysfunction is associated with reduced left ventricular compliance exacerbated by edema often associated with ischemic cross-clamping, reperfusion, and CPB. Inotropic agents used to treat the LCO in the postoperative period will worsen diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction is frequently associated with tachycardia.125 The filling pressures are high and stroke volume reduced because the impaired left ventricular relaxation leads to impaired filling of the LV and a deceased LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring confirms high left-sided filling pressures and LCO. The SVR is elevated as a compensatory mechanism. TEE is diagnostic. It confirms a hypertrophic LV with decreased compliance and filling. The LV may be so hyperdynamic as to obliterate the LV cavity at end-systole. Diastolic dysfunction is difficult to manage. If not managed successfully, end-organ dysfunction is inevitable. The initial steps in management are to assure AV synchrony and adequate preload. Volume should be infused until the PCWP is 20\u201325 mmHg to increase LVEDV. Intuitively, it may seem inappropriate to give volume in the setting of elevated filling pressures, but the elevated filling pressures are the consequence of impaired LV compliance and not volume overload. Inotropic agents should be replaced with lusitropic agents. ACE inhibitors may improve diastolic compliance. Calcium channel blockers also have some lusitropy and may be of benefit. Finally, inamrinone and milrinone have lusitropic properties as does nesiritide. There is no one agent shown to be better than the others and often management requires courses of therapy and observation. If the patient can be guided through the first few days, the cardiac output gradually improves.22\n",

Other causes of ventricular ectopy are hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypoxia, preexisting ectopy, sympathomimetic drugs, and mechanical irritation from the Swan\u2013Ganz catheter. There remains controversy as to the significance of isolated ventricular ectopy. It is not clear what the incidence of isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) degenerating to malignant ventricular arrhythmias actually is. However, most agree that in the presence of active myocardial ischemia, pharmacologic suppression is indicated and this concept includes those patients in the first 24 h after surgery when the myocardium may be irritable. Unlike chronic pharmacologic treatment of isolated ventricular ectopy, treatment in the acute postoperative period is not usually associated with the risk of proarrhythmia. Treatment is particularly beneficial in patients with LV dysfunction and ejection fractions less than 40%. In the first 24 h after surgery, ventricular ectopy is treated if the ectopic beats occur at a rate greater than 6 beats/min or ventricular tachycardia of less than 1 min. The treatment of PVCs begins with the correction of any underlying correctable cause such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. If atrial wires are present, overdrive atrial pacing at a rate greater than the current sinus rate can be tried. Lidocaine is the initial drug treatment for ventricular ectopy. The dosage is an initial loading dose of 1 mg/kg as an initial bolus followed by one or two additional doses of 0.5 mg/kg mg every 10 min. After the initial bolus, an infusion of 1\u20132 mg/min can be started. An alternative option is an initial bolus of 75 mg followed by a loading infusion of 150 mg over 20 min. The loading dose is followed by a \u00admaintenance dose of 1.5\u20132.5 mg/min. If the ectopy is uncontrolled, an additional bolus of 25\u201350 mg can be given and the infusion rate increased. Lidocaine toxicity is a significant risk at infusion rates greater than 4 mg/min, especially in the elderly. If lidocaine does not suppress ectopy, it can be elected not to treat unless ventricular tachycardia occurs or with intravenous amiodarone.",

            "text": "\nSustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) are usually associated with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction or an electrolyte imbalance, but can occur without the obvious presence of either.128 These arrhythmias are most often seen in patients with previous infarcts and subsequent revascularization to the infarcted area, and occur with a frequency of 1\u20133% after cardiac surgery.129 Reperfusion of areas of ischemia or infarction can precipitate VT of VF as the areas of ischemic myocardium are reperfused. The reperfusion arrhythmias occur in patients with unstable angina, recent infarction, and ejection fractions of less than 40%. In these circumstances, nonviable myofibrils embedded in the scar are triggered and this leads to an altered dispersion of repolarization and the development of reentry arrhythmias. The resultant ventricular arrhythmia is usually a sustained polymorphic VT with a normal QT interval as compared to the monomorphic VT noted in patients with a previous myocardial infarction and depressed LV function. This reentry arrhythmia rarely responds to lidocaine and usually requires amiodarone and possible \u03b2-blockade. The treatment of nonsustained VT in patients with preserved LV function is similar to the treatment of PVCs. In patients with ejection fractions less than 30% and nonsustained VT, the prognosis is poor without treatment, and an electrophysiologic evaluation is necessary as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be indicated.130 Sustained VT without hemodynamic instability can be managed with ventricular overdrive pacing. Cardioversion may be necessary if overdrive pacing is not successful or if the patient becomes unstable. An amiodarone bolus of 150 mg infused over 15 min followed by an infusion of 1 mg/min for 6 h, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 h should be prescribed. These patients will ultimately need an electrophysiologic evaluation. All patients with VT or AF with hemodynamic instability require immediate defibrillation as per ACLS protocol.131 If the patient is unresponsive to defibrillation or persistence of hemodynamic instability, the sternotomy must be reopened emergently at the bedside. Torsades de pointes is an uncommon but malignant arrhythmia not often related to the postoperative cardiac surgical patient. On the EKG monitor, the QRS complex appears to \u201ctwist\u201d around the isoelectric baseline. Its onset is usually pause-dependent, initiated by a PVC occurring at the end of a T wave. It is usually associated with a prolonged QT interval. Treatment of torsades de pointes is immediate cardioversion. If the patient is not hyperkalemic, potassium chloride should be administered to shorten the QT interval. Magnesium and \u03b2-blockers may eliminate the trigger and prevent recurrence. Finally, ventricular pacing at 90\u2013100 bpm or an isoproterenol infusion of 1\u20134 mcg/min will shorten the action potential and prevent early afterdepolarization.132,133 Be aware that a wide complex tachyarrhythmia does not necessarily indicate ventricular tachycardia because atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response can result in RBBB with aberrant conduction (so-called Ashman phenomenon) mimicking ventricular tachycardia.20\n",

If the patient is hemodynamically stable, the initial treatment of postoperative AF is rate control and is indicated if it lasts longer than 15\u201330 min or is associated with severe symptoms.138 The most important aspect of the treatment of postoperative AF is the control of the ventricular rate. In many protocols, the first-line agent for rate control is the calcium channel blocker diltiazem. Therapy is initiated with a bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 min and followed by an infusion of 10\u201315 mg/h to titrate the heart rate to less than 120 bpm. Slowing of the ventricular rate is usually noted within 3 min and is more effective for atrial fibrillation than atrial flutter. The use of diltiazem is limited by hypotension, which occurs with an incidence of 5\u201320%.146,147 Pretreatment with 500 mg of calcium may lessen the hypotensive effect. Diltiazem has a mild negative inotropic effect and must be used with caution in patients with compromised left ventricular function. While diltiazem is extremely effective in slowing the ventricular rate, it converts fewer than 10% to sinus rhythm. Verapamil can be used in lieu of diltiazem for rate control in rapid atrial fibrillation. Begin with a bolus of 20\u201325 mg, then an infusion of 10\u201315 mg/h. If the blood pressure is tenuous, pretreat with 500\u20131,000 mg of calcium chloride. While calcium channel blockers are effective rate control agents, they are not as effective as \u03b2-blockers in converting patients back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Beta-blockers are equally or more effective for rate control and also can effect conversion to NSR 50% of the time.148,149 They are not used as frequently for postoperative AF by some clinicians because of their negative inotropic properties. Esmolol is a short acting, selective \u03b2-blocker. It must be used in an ICU setting with appropriate monitoring because of its propensity to cause hypotension, particularly in patients with poor LV function. The loading dose is 0.25\u20130.5 mg/kg over 1 min followed by an infusion of 50\u2013200 mcg/kg/min. Metoprolol has less of a tendency to cause hypotension and is more suited for use in a non-ICU area. It is a long-acting, selective \u03b2-blocker. It is dosed at 5 mg IV every 5 min to a total dose of 15 mg. Digoxin has only a modest response in the acute setting. There is only a 10\u201315% decrease in ventricular rate with digoxin alone.150\n",

It is becoming the drug of choice for postoperative AF because it is safe and effective. It is associated with only modest hypotension and has no proarrhythmic effects. It does slow the ventricular rate as effectively as \u03b2-blockers or calcium channel blockers, which are often used as adjuncts to amiodarone.151 It does have a higher rate of cardioversion than either calcium channel blockers or \u03b2-blockers. Amiodarone has the same frequency of cardioversion as type 1C antiarrhythmics, but takes longer.152 Amiodarone has fewer adverse side effects than those antiarrhythmics. It can be given intravenously, but is just as effective orally for non-life-threatening arrhythmias. The half-life of the drug is long, up to 120 days, and its long-term use is associated with visual disturbances, tremors and other neurologic sequelae, hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, photosensitivity, skin discoloration, thyroid abnormalities, and cardiac conduction disturbances. These side effects, however, are rarely a factor when used to treat postoperative atrial fibrillation because amiodarone is administered only for 6 weeks. If given intravenously, the initial loading dose is 150 mg over 15 min, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/min for 6 h, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 h. An oral taper dose is then prescribed of 400 mg bid for 1 week, 400 mg daily for 1 week, then 200 mg daily for 2 weeks.

About 5% of the patients will have permanent conduction abnormalities. The associated bradycardia is treated with temporary epicardial pacing. The most commonly used mode is ventricular pacing. In all the open-heart patients, temporary epicardial ventricular pacing wires are fixed to the right ventricle and, in many, right atrial wires are also placed. Bradycardia from any etiology is an indication for ventricular pacing. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable with simple ventricular pacing, physiologic pacing may be required if atrial electrodes are available. If an atrial electrode was not fixed to the heart, a temporary transvenous atrial pacing electrode can be inserted. Simple ventricular pacing is accomplished by connecting the temporary electrodes to an external pacemaker. These pacemaker units are bipolar and require the ventricular lead electrode be connected to the negative pole and an indifferent electrode, often a skin wire, connected to the positive pole of the pacemaker. The output is set initially at 10 mA and the threshold adjusted to assure a safe margin of capture. A decision is then made as to the mode of pacing; i.e., synchronous (demand) or asynchronous (fixed). The synchronous mode is chosen to avoid pacer stimulation on the T wave and the resulting ventricular fibrillation. The asynchronous mode is used only in unusual situations, such as the use of electrocautery, when other electrical activity interfere with the sensing in the synchronous mode. The rate must be set depending on the needs of the patient. Physiologic pacing requires choosing the desired mode, atrial thresholds, atrioventricular intervals, as well as the ventricular settings. Failure to pace may be the result of faulty electrical connections, dislodgment of the epicardial electrodes from the heart, a faulty pacemaker, the development of electrically silent areas of the myocardium in the region of the electrodes, or the development of a rhythm incompatible with pacing such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation.",

            "text": "\nPlatelet defects are also an important cause of postoperative bleeding. The platelet-related bleeding diathesis is a result of a decrease in the absolute platelet number, and more importantly, secondary to impaired platelet function.183,184 The decrease in the platelet number, or quantitative defect, results from hemodilution, preoperative thrombocytopenia from medications, and the consumption of platelets by the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. The CPB circuit itself can reduce the platelet count by 30\u201350% and worsens as the duration of bypass lengthens. The diminished platelet function, or qualitative defect, may be directly related to the duration of CPB. Passage of platelets through the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit results in decreased platelet membrane receptors for fibrinogen and glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex.185 Thrombocytopenia may also be caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This usually occurs in patients with a previous exposure to heparin within 3 months. It is the result of heparin antibodies causing platelet aggregation. There is often a history of heparin resistance during CPB.186 The qualitative defect in platelets may also be related to preoperative medications such as aspirin, heparin, and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.187,188\nResidual heparin effect can account for a postoperative bleeding diathesis. Heparin effect is usually reversed by the time the patient gets to the intensive care unit. It should always be considered as a possibility in the bleeding patient. Heparin rebound is the recurrence of measurable heparin activity after complete protamine neutralization. It is associated with larger heparin doses given intraoperatively, after long CPB runs, and obese patients.189 It is thought to be the result of elution of heparin from plasma proteins190\nHypothermia is a significant cause for postoperative coagulopathy. The coagulation cascade is mediated by enzymatic reactions. These reactions are temperature-sensitive and occur most efficiently at normothermia. Hypothermia retards the normal coagulation cascade as a result of this altered enzymatic activity. Hemodilution of CPB is another source of coagulopathy and affects all blood elements including coagulation factors. Most factors are reduced by 50% and factor V by 80%.191 This phenomenon affects patients with small blood volumes more profoundly. Also, coagulation factors are lost with cell saving.",

Qualitative platelet defects, \u00adthrombasthenia, can be present with a normal platelet count but platelet function will be abnormal and the clot formation inadequate.

Initial therapy begins by sending coagulation studies to include a PT, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen level. Then, notify the blood bank that component therapy will be needed and an adequate supply of cross-matched packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (contains all coagulation factors except platelets), cryoprecipitate (factor VIII and fibrinogen), and platelet concentrates should be readily available. Next, hypothermia should be corrected. Within the first 2 h and even before the coagulation studies are available, consider the empiric use of protamine sulfate in the event residual heparin or heparin rebound is the cause. If the bleeding continues after the hypothermia is corrected and the empiric protamine is given, an algorithmic approach can be used.194 This algorithm begins by sending coagulation studies. Then, transfuse platelets, 1 unit/10 kg body weight, and draw post-transfusion platelet count. If the bleeding continues and the posttransfusion platelet count is less than 100,000, repeat the platelet transfusion of 1 unit/10 kg body weight.

The dosage is 25\u201350 mg increments given IV over 10 min. Be aware there are three types of adverse reactions to protamine administration. Type I reaction is systemic hypotension from rapid administration that usually occurs if the entire neutralizing dose is given in less than 3 min. It is a histamine release reaction that causes a reduction in the SVR and PVR. It can be avoided by giving the dose over 10\u201315 min. Type II reaction is an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction resulting in hypotension, bronchospasm, flushing, and edema. It is further divided into Type IIA that is an idiosyncratic reaction mediated by IgE or IgG and is caused by the release of histamine or leukotrienes producing a capillary leak syndrome with hypotension and edema. It usually occurs within the first 10 min of administration. Type IIB is an immediate reaction and is not related to immunoglobulins. Type IIC is a delayed reaction occurring after 20 min or longer, and seems to be related to complement activation and leukotriene release producing bronchospasm and a capillary leak syndrome that leads to hypovolemia and noncardiac pulmonary edema. Type III reaction is catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction with acute pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and severe peripheral \u00advasodilatation with hypotension and \u00admyocardial depression. It occurs 10\u201320 min after the protamine is given and is thought to be secondary to the heparin\u2013protamine complex. This complex incites leukocyte aggregation and the release of liposomal enzymes that damage pulmonary tissue. Type III reactions are highly lethal unless cardiopulmonary bypass can be reinstituted to support the patient. Treatment is initially calcium chloride and \u03b1-agonists to support the SVR. It may also be beneficial to add \u03b2-agonists to reduce the PVR. Specific drugs to lower the PVR (such as prostaglandin E) may be helpful, but usually it is necessary to readminister heparin and reinstitute cardiopulmonary bypass.",

            "text": "\nBlood conservation is an important part of managing the postoperative patient both with and without significant bleeding. There are preoperative measures, intraoperative measures, and postoperative measures. The preoperative measures include autologous blood donation for elective cardiac procedures. This must be done with care, particularly in the patient with ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure secondary to valvular heart disease. Therefore, it is not a measure widely practiced. Another preoperative measure is the modification of the preoperative antiplatelet regimen within limits of therapeutic prudence. And, finally, preoperative erythropoietin can be used in the anemic patient to improve hemoglobin levels sufficiently to avoid perioperative transfusions.203 Intraoperatively, the crystalloid prime of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with resultant hemodilution to hematocrit of 20\u201330% minimizes the loss of red cells. Also, blood salvage with reinfusion of washed, centrifuged red cells, both from the field and from the circuit after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, conserves blood. Careful operative hemostasis is a must for blood conservation. Postoperative autotransfusion and cell saving also conserve blood and reduce the complications of transfusions. The \u201ccell saver\u201d in most institutions has supplanted traditional autotransfusion techniques. The cell saver is a system that combines washing and centrifuging shed blood before reinfusing, as opposed to directly reinfusing shed blood after passing it though a filter. Shed blood does not require an anticoagulant because it has undergone fibrinolysis, unless the hemorrhage was extremely rapid. Shed, traditional autotransfused blood has low levels of factors VIII and fibrinogen as well as platelets, but the platelets present are dysfunctional. Autotransfused blood does contain fibrin-split products. Conversely, cell saver blood is devoid of clotting factors and platelets as well as fibrin-split products.204 Transfusion of less than one liter of either autotransfusion blood or cell saver blood is without significant risk of exacerbating a coagulopathy. Transfusion of greater amounts can potentially worsen the coagulopathy by infusing fibrin monomers, in the case of autotransfusion, and from platelet and factor depletion with both.205,206 Autotransfusion of greater than 1,500 mL of shed blood should be avoided and blood component therapy should be used to augment reinfusion of cell saver blood to avoid depletion of platelets and clotting factors.",

First, a pulsus paradoxus is not an applicable sign of tamponade in the patient on positive pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation reverses blood pressure response to respiration. On the ventilator, during early inspiration, the positive airway pressure causes a compression of the pulmonary veins augmenting left heart filling and thus blood pressure, whereas, later in the inspiratory cycle, left heart filling is diminished and the blood pressure falls. This early rise in the blood pressure is opposite of the fall in blood pressure seen during spontaneous inspiration and makes pulsus paradoxus an unreliable sign of tamponade during positive pressure ventilation. Also, it is not unusual for a clot to accumulate next to the right or left atrium and cause unequal elevations of the RA or LA pressures. Most important, the diagnosis will be made only if a high degree of suspicion is maintained.

Leukocytes are also activated and cause an inflammatory response of the pulmonary vasculature.211 During CPB and diminished pulmonary arterial flow, plasma thromboxane B2 increases, further contributing to the pulmonary vascular inflammation.212 The cumulative effect of these responses is a more permeable alveolar\u2013capillary membrane and a predisposition to interstitial pulmonary edema.213 Atelectasis also contributes to pulmonary dysfunction. This appears in some way to be linked to a decrease in pulmonary surfactant, and may partially explain the left lower atelectasis seen almost universally after cardiac surgery.214 Thermal injury to the phrenic nerve and/or diaphragmatic dysfunction as well as effusions, pain, and chest tubes are other contributing factors to altered pulmonary function postoperatively.

The unique factors include: incision pain, the interference of chest tubes with the respiratory function, an element of diaphragmatic dysfunction, elevated left heart filling pressures with alveolar edema and diminished compliance, and capillary permeability.20,31,215 Atelectasis is the most common pulmonary complication occurring in 70% of these patients.216 After cardiac surgery, atelectasis occurs most commonly in the left lower lobe. The exact etiology of this phenomenon remains unclear. It is associated with left phrenic nerve paralysis only in 11% of patients.217 Alterations of the chest wall result in a decrease in the FEV1 and FRC and persist for 6 weeks. These alterations lead to an increased respiratory rate, decrease tidal volume, decreased respiratory efficiency, and increased oxygen utilization. Pulmonary infiltrates are the result of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \u2013 although with ARDS, there is typically more of a diffuse process and is associated with more severe hypoxemia. The basic treatment of pneumonia and ARDS includes blood and sputum cultures, hemodynamic maintenance, euvolemic fluid management with a consideration of fluid restriction and the use of colloid for ARDS, and the maintenance of an arterial saturation greater than 50 mmHg with minimum inspired oxygen content.218\u2013220 Bronchospasm can occur immediately after CPB and may interfere with hemodynamic stability. The probable cause is activation of C5a anaphylatoxin by CPB. Other causes include pulmonary edema, exacerbation of preexisting reactive airway disease, the use of \u03b2-blockers, and a reaction to protamine.216 The treatment for bronchospasm includes the exclusion of heart failure, inhaled \u03b22-agonists, the addition of cholinergic agents, a short course of systemic steroids for refractory bronchospasm, and intravenous aminophylline. Aminophylline is reserved for refractory situations because of its arrhythmogenicity in the postoperative period.",

The nonpulsatile blood flow of CPB promotes renal artery vasoconstriction and diminishes renal blood flow to the cortex. In addition, angiotensin II levels are elevated by nonpulsatile flow.223,224 There appears to be a relationship between length of CPB and renal insufficiency, but not pressure or flow rates while on pump.225 Other factors associated with renal failure include preexisting renal dysfunction (creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL), older age, poor left ventricular function and congestive heart failure, emergency surgery, the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, moderate hypothermia, a preoperative history of hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, isolated valve operations, and the use of radiocontrast dye agents immediately preoperatively. Postoperative factors contributing to renal insufficiency include: low cardiac output; hypotension; vasoconstriction; atheroembolism from the IABP; sepsis; RV failure with systemic venous hypertension; respiratory insufficiency with hypoxemia; and medications such as cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and ACE-inhibitors.22,226\u2013232 The incidence of renal complications following open-heart surgery has been reported as high as 35%.

Strict euvolemia must be maintained, as well as careful monitoring of metabolic status and electrolyte balance and the daily review of medications looking for drugs excreted by kidneys. If renal failure occurs several days following surgery, it is most likely not related to CPB but more likely as a result of sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, low cardiac output, and obstruction of the urinary tract.",

Elevated LFTs in association with hyperbilirubinemia occurring within the first 1\u201310 days is a result of low cardiac output and \u201cshock liver.\u201d Shock liver may cause hemodynamic instability with low systemic vascular resistance. Hyperbilirubinemia without elevated LFTs, if it occurs early, may be the result of cholestasis from red blood cell trauma and destruction, as well as from right heart failure with passive congestion of the liver, although the alkaline phosphatase may be elevated in this instance. Bilirubin usually normalizes in 1\u201314 days with observation only. If isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurs late, it is caused by infection from transfused blood products. The risk of infection after transfusion depends on the number of units transfused and types of products transfused.

            "text": "\nElectrolyte imbalances are common after cardiopulmonary bypass. Potassium alterations are the result of rapid shifts that occur during cardiac surgery and CPB. The factors related to potassium fluxes are hyperkalemic cardioplegia, renal dysfunction while on CPB, low cardiac output and associated oliguria and acidosis, hemolysis of red cells, diuresis, and diminished potassium uptake in the face of diabetes mellitus.20 Certain medications also impair potassium excretion and cause hyperkalemia. This list of medications include ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers, and \u03b2-blockers.22 The principal adverse effect of potassium alterations is on the electrical activity of the heart and can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia manifests itself predominantly electrocardiographically. Asystolic arrest can occur when potassium rises rapidly to a level exceeding 6.5 mEq/L. The EKG findings are more related to the rate of rise of potassium level than to an absolute level. They are peaked T waves, ST depression, prolonged PR interval, loss of P wave, QRS widening, bradycardia, and asystole. Hyperkalemia may result in failure of the heart to respond to the pacemaker stimulus and this may be a factor during resuscitation. Treatment includes optimizing cardiac function and shifting potassium into the cells and increasing its excretion. The cardiac function is optimized with calcium gluconate. If there is evidence of cardiac toxicity, 0.5\u20131 g of calcium gluconate is given intravenously over 15 min. Potassium is shifted into the cells by giving 50 mEq of NaHCO3 to correct acidosis and giving 10 units of regular insulin and 25 g of 50% dextrose. Potassium excretion is enhanced with furosemide 10\u2013200 mg IV, Kayexalate enema 50 g in water enema or 50 g PO with sorbitol or dialysis. Hypokalemia is usually a result of diuresis without adequate replacement of potassium. Diuresis is usually profound after CPB owing to hemodilution. Diuretics, insulin administration, or alkalosis may exacerbate this diuresis. Hypokalemia promotes atrial, junctional, and ventricular ectopy.22 It can cause life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, but usually does not become clinically evident until serum concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L. Hypokalemia can also be the cause of metabolic alkalosis as hydrogen ions replace potassium within the cells. The treatment is potassium chloride (KCl) administration through a central line at 10\u201320 mEq/h. Serum potassium raises approximately 0.1 mEq/L for each 2 mEq of KCl given. A slower rate is recommended in the presence of renal insufficiency.",

Manifestations of hypomagnesemia include atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias, potentiation of digoxin-related dysrhythmias, and a predilection to coronary spasm. Since magnesium is also related to energy metabolism, prolonged ventilator support has also been related to low serum magnesium levels. Treatment is an infusion of 2 g magnesium sulfate in 100 mL of solution to raise the serum level to 2 mEq/L.

Bleeding from thrombocytopenia is usually not a problem until the platelet count falls below 60,000/mm3. Of greater clinical significance is the progressive deterioration of platelet function during CPB. Within minutes of CPB, platelet aggregation is impaired and continues to worsen throughout CPB. This platelet dysfunction is precipitated by contact of the platelets with synthetic surfaces of the CPB circuit as well as by hypothermia. Also, the mechanical stresses of CPB cause fragmentation of the platelets and a temporary depletion in the membrane antigen for glycoproteins IB, IIb, and IIIa.255 Hypothermia impairs platelet thromboxane A2 synthesis resulting in reversible platelet dysfunction. Bleeding time returns to normal in about 2\u20134 h and the platelet count is restored in \u00adseveral days.208,256,257 Platelet dysfunction occurs less commonly with the use of antifibrinolytic drugs, such as \u03b5-aminocaproic acid, because these agents act in part by reducing platelet activation during CPB.",

Transient ischemic attacks present with focal deficits of hemiparesis or hemiplegia, aphasia, dysarthria, hand incoordination, visual deficits (either retinal or central), and coma. If an interventional neurologist is available, an immediate consultation should be obtained. An evaluation begins with a careful neurologic examination, then a CT scan of the brain with contrast infusion, an echocardiogram (surface or transesophageal) to exclude a cardiac source, and noninvasive carotid studies. If there is no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan, heparin is started, and then warfarin if the stroke is thought to be embolic. If the deficit occurs during surgery, there is some debate as to the need for anticoagulation versus just antiplatelet therapy. Other therapy includes the standard measures to reduce intracranial pressure and even a carotid endarterectomy in patients with severe carotid stenosis and transient neurologic deficits. Physical therapy is started soon after the event is diagnosed. As regards prognosis, patients with focal deficits have an excellent prognosis. In patients with coma, the prognosis is poor with a mortality rate of 50% and a high percentage of survivors staying in the vegetative state.22\n",
