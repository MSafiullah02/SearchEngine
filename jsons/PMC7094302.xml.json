Interestingly, the virus directs the synthesis and secretion of the modified glycoprotein (sGP) from these infected cells into the surrounding tissues and blood. The purpose of this maneuver may be to deter immune reactivity which could slow the replication and dissemination process rather than simply act as an anti-EBOV antibody sink. This is more likely the case during the early phases of disease prior to antibody synthesis. Given the importance of monocytes and macrophages in the early innate response to viral invaders, first we sought to examine the effect of EBOV sGP upon the activation of non-infected monocytes and macrophages. In order to test this in vitro, the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, which can be differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 200 nM PMA for three days, followed by a five-day rest, was used as a source of cells [17]. The THP-1 monocytes and macrophages were challenged with LPS for 24 h as a way to activate the cells and trigger cytokine production. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and treated with either a low (4 \u03bcg/ml) or high (8 \u03bcg/ml) dose of sGP for 24 h. IL-6 production by monocytes was not statistically affected by either dosage of sGP (Fig. 1\nA). However, the production of IL-6 by macrophages was significantly inhibited in the presence of sGP (Fig. 1B). The low and high doses of sGP seemed to affect the activated macrophages equally; therefore, we chose to use the low dose throughout the remainder of the study. The results suggest that sGP may have a direct inhibitory effect on non-infected macrophages.",

To test whether sGP will inhibit the polarization of M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were incubated with sGP and IFN\u03b3 simultaneously for 24 h and then washed, and stimulated with LPS to induce cytokine production. When EBOV sGP was present during the polarization of M1 macrophages, there was no significant effect on the cytokine profile that is characteristic for M1 macrophages (Fig. 2\nA). The production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, should be high for M1 macrophages as compared to resting M0 or M2 macrophages, and there was no significant change in these cytokine levels when macrophages were polarized with IFN\u03b3 in the presence of sGP. Typically, M1 macrophages produce low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, upon stimulation with LPS and the level of the cytokine was not affected by the presence of sGP during M1 polarization (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the basal level of IL-10 production by the M1 macrophages was significantly greater than that of LPS-stimulated cells. This is likely due to the ability of LPS to promote M1 macrophage functions thereby resulting in a lower IL-10 production by these stimulated cells [22]. Of note, basal production of IL-10 by sGP-cultured M1 macrophages was decreased relative to LPS-stimulated cells. Possibly sGP ligation to an unknown receptor on the macrophages resulted in activation of an adaptor protein which operated to reduce basal release of IL-10. However, activation of sGP-treated M1 macrophages resulted in restoration of IL-10 levels to that of LPS-stimulated cells.",

Previously, it was thought that the primary role sGP served in pathogenesis was acting as a decoy molecule for antibody production [6]. In this study, we show for the first time that sGP has profound inhibitory effects upon activated macrophages that may condition the cells for susceptibility to infection by progeny virion. EBOV sGP inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, impaired chemotaxis, and downregulated integrin expression. Phagocytosis of the activated macrophages was unaffected which is consistent with recent data supporting the notion that EBOV utilizes \u201capoptotic mimicry\u201d and the phagocytosis mechanisms to invade the macrophages [16]. Thus, our findings suggest that sGP is produced to halt activated macrophage anti-viral activities and potentially preserving the entry site for the virion. In addition, once the activated macrophages are infected, EBOV glycoprotein and viral protein-40 may operate to override sGP-mediated inhibition to restore migration and cytokine production resulting in systemic dissemination of the virus and viral hemorrhagic fever.",

This suggests an unusually high rate of viral replication that likely is accompanied by large amounts of pathogen-associated molecular patterns including the viral nucleic acids. In response, monocytes have been shown to emigrate from the bone marrow and into the bloodstream during the first 72 h of microbial infection [27]. However, systemic spread of the virus and high mortality suggests that despite the rapid mobilization of the innate response, EBOV is able to overwhelm the early host response in order to infect \u201ccarrier\u201d cells (i.e. macrophages and DCs) for the purpose of disseminating the virus from the site of initial infection. The hypothesis put forward in this work was that EBOV sGP operates to inhibit effector activities of these immune cells prior to their infection. Efforts to assess the modulation of DCs by sGP are underway (unpublished data). Here, the focus was on monocytes and macrophages (resting and activated). Monocytes have little impact upon viral replication given their limited phagocytic ability and cytokine production and likely are not a target of EBOV sGP. This notion was supported by the inability of sGP to alter IL-6 production by THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 1A). By contrast, upon differentiation of monocytes into macrophages using PMA, and activation by LPS, THP-1 macrophages produced significantly less IL-6 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, sGP impacts macrophages only after differentiation from monocytes. This could suggest that the receptor on which sGP is binding is only expressed on differentiated macrophages and not monocytes. Work is proceeding to identify the sGP receptor as well as the signaling that may be initiated in macrophages upon incubation with sGP.",

Viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus and human cytomegalovirus have all been associated with promoting M2 polarization to support successful viral replication [28]. Thus, it was thought that EBOV may similarly promote M2 polarization through the secretion of a viral protein to modulate this process. Using the in vitro THP-1 model, EBOV sGP did not demonstrate the ability to affect the polarization of macrophages into M1 or M2 phenotypes (Fig. 2). This would seem to suggest that the spread of EBOV can benefit from correctly polarized macrophages. Again, because the macrophages were cultured with sGP prior to activation with LPS, it strongly suggests that the receptor for the viral protein is expressed or upregulated after the cells are stimulated.",

The production is also not affected if sGP is given during the polarization of M2 macrophages as noted above. However, if sGP is given during the polarization of M1 macrophages then the production of IL-10 is significantly decreased. This could possibly be due to the activity of some sGP-mediated activation of a regulatory adaptor protein such as interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), which has a profound inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine production [29], but a milder inhibitory effect on IL-10 production [30], [31]. The fact that sGP only interferes with the IL-10 production if given during the polarization step could be due to a role of a regulatory protein such as IRF-4 in the differentiation process of hematopoietic stem cells [31]. IRF-4 has been previously shown to be a target of viral processes to suppress the immune response and promote viral pathogenesis [32], [33]. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of sGP promotes IRF-4 activity and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, and only impacts the IL-10 production of M1 macrophages. This is a possibility that will be pursued in future work.",

Other studies also show that soluble EBOV glycoprotein (shed, secreted, and spike) has no effect on macrophages [34]. Both of these studies were asking whether non-activated macrophages are stimulated to produce cytokines when treated with EBOV secreted glycoprotein; essentially asking whether sGP stimulates macrophage cytokine production. Thus, the finding that sGP can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by previously activated macrophages is novel (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effect of sGP upon IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 production may occur at either the genetic or protein secretion level. When administered to mice, the half-life of LPS is 12 h and is likely much shorter in vitro\n[35]. Given that the macrophages are activated with LPS for 24 h and then washed to remove excess LPS before sGP is added, this suggests that sGP does not compete with LPS for TLR4 binding as is thought for shed GP [7]. So, EBOV sGP must affect LPS-induced signaling downstream, perhaps intervening to inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB by reinstating the action of I\u03baB kinase (IKK) [36]. Another LPS-induced pathway that may be influenced by sGP are the mitogen-activated protein kinases, MAPK. LPS binding to Toll-like receptor 4 induces MyD88 signaling through recruitment and phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-4); which, in turn, activates IRAK-1. MAPK (and NF-\u03baB) are subsequently activated leading to cytokine production [37]. Two proteins that block IRAK-4 may be triggered by sGP, Tollip and IRAK-M. Another protein, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), could also be induced by sGP to interfere with cytokine production. Additionally, since IL-10 production by M2 macrophages was unchanged in the presence of sGP, it is highly unlikely that sGP impedes pro-inflammatory cytokine production by blocking protein secretory pathways. An understanding of how sGP affects NF-\u03baB as well as the MAPK signaling pathways leading to cytokine production are underway.",

Possibly, sGP has a much shorter half-life than LPS; and thus, cytokines could be reduced for a short term and then restored by the time cytokine concentrations are determined at the 24-h endpoint of the experiment. An examination of the cytokine production at 12, 16, 20 and 24 h will address this issue. This rapid turnover may account for the projected high levels of sGP in the tissues and blood of infected animals [7]. EBOV GP and LPS have also been suggested to compete for the same receptor, TLR4; a possible attachment factor for the virus [7], [13], [38], which is expressed on macrophages. Whether the secreted, truncated version of GP may also bind to TLR4 is unknown. From these studies, sGP appeared not to have an impact upon cellular functions until the cells were activated suggesting that the receptor may not be constitutively expressed. Interestingly, related studies with natural killer (NK) cells lacking TLR4 and treatment with sGP have shown inhibition of NK effector functions indicating that sGP may at least have an alternate receptor which exists both on activated macrophages and NK cells (unpublished data).",

Interestingly, phagocytosis of ovalbumin by activated THP-1 M1 macrophages was not affected by treatment of sGP (Fig. 4).

EBOV sGP exhibited the ability to diminish the capacity of THP-1 M1 macrophages to migrate in response to MCP-1 (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the integrin CD11b is widely accepted as a marker of macrophage phenotypes; it has also been shown to be necessary for chemotactic ability of activated macrophages [41], [42]. The assessment of CD11b in activated macrophages incubated with sGP demonstrated reduced expression of the cellular marker as compared to controls (Fig. 5B).",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results suggest a novel mechanism whereby EBOV sGP shuts down anti-viral immunity mediated by activated macrophages to create a pool of susceptible cells primed for infection. Indeed, EBOV sGP inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and chemotaxis while preserving the cellular ability to take up antigens. Therefore, sGP may play a major role in EBOV pathogenesis in two ways. First, by impairing activated macrophages, the virus can rapidly produce progeny virion and spread to other parts of the body. Second, the paralyzed macrophages serve as a pool of susceptible host cells for infection. This information may be an important consideration when devising therapies given the unusually high replication rate of the virus and copious production of soluble viral proteins such as sGP, which may diminish efficacy of host immunity.",
