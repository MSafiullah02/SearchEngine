In response to the widespread of COVID-19, with the objective to minimize community spread of the disease, countries adopted many preventive strategies like social distancing, lockdowns, and quarantine of suspected cases. Owing to the transmission of COVID-19 through droplets and aerosols, which are inherent features of dental practice, most of the countries followed a strategy of suspension of all elective dental care services and reserving dental care only for emergency cases. In this brief communication, we examine the impact of closure of dental practices during COVID-19 pandemic on missing opportunities for the early detection of oral cancer and discuss approaches to minimize the risks of delayed diagnosis.",

The major attributable fraction of the risk of oral cancer is attributed to tobacco [3] , either smoked or smokeless, alcohol and betel quid use. Most of oral cancer cases occur in low-and middle-income countries and among low socioeconomic groups in a population [4] . Indeed, around 30% of the global burden of oral cancer being in the Indian subcontinent, where it ranks the first of all body cancers in men [2] .",
