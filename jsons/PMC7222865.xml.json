A recent prospective observational study from Papua New Guinea reported a case fatality rate of 25% (4 out of 16) in children with TBP [7]. The most recently published retrospective observational study of children with TBP reported only one death out of 30 children, with the cause of death being ascribed to disseminated TB. The authors acknowledge that actual mortality might have been underestimated due to loss to follow-up [8]. The study reported that 10% of children developed constrictive pericarditis. This is in contrast to an earlier retrospective study of 44 pediatric TBP cases which reported no deaths and 5 cases (20%) of constrictive pericarditis at follow-up [9]. There is a need for further research in pediatric TBP, especially considering the disproportionate impact of EPTB on this vulnerable population.",

Despite best efforts, 15\u201320% of the pericardial disease are never diagnosed [24], reflecting the overall paucity in reliable, cost-effective new diagnostic tests that can rapidly aid clinical decision-making. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) remains the most widely used biochemical test even though it is limited as a rule in test [25], and the yields from fluid microscopy and culture remain both low and time-consuming. The result is that the practice in many high TB burden regions has been to treat for TB empirically [19] despite observational evidence that empiric therapy is associated with higher morbidity and mortality [26]. For ease of diagnosis in TB endemic countries, some authors have developed criteria for diagnosis of definitive and probable TBP [27] based on clinical and laboratory findings (Table 2).",

There have been no new applicable technologies or methods to increase the reduced yield of pericardial fluid smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB); however, the high specificity of positive microscopy may justify its continued use [31]. Concomitant HIV infection does seem to affect the yield of pericardial fluid culture. A recent study involving predominantly HIV-infected participants (72%), and making use of liquid culture media only, detected culture positivity in 46 out of 131 (35%) of pericardial fluid specimens [31]. Where there is diagnostic doubt despite biochemical ADA and fluid culture, or where the pericardial fluid is difficult to obtain or in the research setting, a biopsy of the pericardium or epicardium may be warranted [32\u2022, 33]. However, there are no new techniques or tools to increase the yield from histological analysis, which remains 10\u201364% [27]. What is new is that problems with obtaining representative pericardial biopsy samples could potentially be overcome by using percutaneous pericardioscopy. A small pilot study using the technique demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 60% using AFB staining of biopsy samples, with an additional 13.3% being diagnosed by identification of granulomatous inflammation on histology [30].",

In a study assessing the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF in TBP and other forms of extrapulmonary TB, the sensitivity was 63.8%, with high specificity (100%) [34]. Elsewhere, use of Xpert MTB/RIF on pericardial biopsy samples increased the sensitivity to 78% [35\u2022\u2022]. These results do not show much improvement from much older studies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques [36]. Finally, it is notable that the use of Xpert MTB/RIF in combination with ADA does increase the sensitivity and overall accuracy of the diagnosis of TBP and could be considered a diagnostic option where there is major diagnostic uncertainty [37].

A recent meta-analysis of four published studies found an overall sensitivity (97%) and specificity (99%) of PCF IFN-\u03b3 to diagnose TBP, in addition to a positive likelihood ratio of 187 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.03, which provides strong evidence that PCF IFN-\u03b3 could be used as a stand-alone test to diagnose or exclude TBP [41\u2022\u2022].

This is important because of recent findings from a small pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, which demonstrated that there is low penetration of anti-TB drugs in the pericardial space over the first 24 h following drug administration. The median peak pericardial fluid rifampicin concentrations were significantly lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [43]. In the same study, pyrazinamide peak concentration was 40 times lower than the pH adjusted MIC. Isoniazid was the only drug found at adequate concentrations in the pericardial fluid of patients with TBP. These findings suggest that there is an urgent need to investigate higher doses or alternative drug regimens in patients with TBP, in whom poor drug penetration may contribute to the poor outcomes observed. This is particularly true considering recent evidence of the close relationship between the burden of bacillary load within the pericardium and mortality [18].",

There are still no studies comparing routine evacuation of the pericardium and evacuation only for clinical tamponade. However, the recent characterization of the pericardial fluid with toxic proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators has added to the list of theoretical benefits the manual removal of these mediators to prevent short- and long-term damage to the pericardium. There is also good circumstantial evidence that in recent prospective studies with high rates of pericardiocentesis [21, 45, 46], the rates of constrictive pericarditis are lower (5\u201315%) than the rates (17\u201330%) quoted from eras when there was less aggressive use of the intervention [3, 20].",

In a recent Cochrane review of the 4 randomized trials [51], analysis of the cumulative data suggested that there was low certainty of evidence for a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59\u20131.09; 660 participants), compared with those who did not receive steroids in whom a significant reduction in pericarditis-related deaths was reported (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.80; 660 participants). However, among HIV-positive participants, in the large and most robust of the studies, no evidence for a reduction in mortality was found with a possible increase in the rates of HIV/AIDS-related malignancy in those with advanced HIV but who were not yet on ART at enrolment [52\u2022\u2022]. The same study showed a reduction in the risk of constrictive pericarditis and rehospitalizations in participants on corticosteroids independent of HIV status [21\u2022\u2022]. Based on these findings, the European Society of Cardiology pericardial disease guidelines recommend that it may be reasonable to use adjunctive corticosteroids at a tapering dose of 120 mg of prednisolone over 6 weeks in patients with TBP without HIV infection, and to avoid their use in HIV-infected individuals because of the increased risk of malignancy [28]. The use of M. indicus pranii immunotherapy was evaluated in the same RCT by factorial design and was found to be neutral on all efficacy outcomes in HIV-negative participants, with increased malignancy in the subset with advanced HIV but not on ART [21\u2022\u2022].",
