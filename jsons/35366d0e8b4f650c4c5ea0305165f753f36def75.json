Here we provide an analysis of the combined dataset of Wave 1 and Wave 2 cases adjusted and aligned at the time period of approximately 2 months after the first local exposure. The intent of this work is to analyze the distribution of case data points in the most informative parameter spaces identified by unsupervised machine learning methods and to attempt identification of the cases with the heaviest impact. Evaluating the combination of the parameters that can identify such cases would allow to evaluate and predict the potential risks of heavy impacts in the population proactively with the potential to make necessary corrections before the explosive onset that may result in a heavy cost to the society.",

A common comment for several of them is that due to limitation of time and resources, a rating scale approach was chosen for those factors that cannot or would be challenging to measure directly.
