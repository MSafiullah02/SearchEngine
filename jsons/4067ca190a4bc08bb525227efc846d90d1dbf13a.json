I would suggest however that through this storm we should also seek hope that we may learn things that will improve patient care going forward. I would suggest it should be mandatory for all medical inpatients to have a Treatment Escalation Plan (TEP) or similar completed on admission and the appropriateness reviewed throughout their inpatient stay. is is one of the few things we can offer to these patients as physicians and as geriatricians we are well placed to lead and sustain this change.",

Appropriate ceilings of care will also prevent the unnecessary viral exposure to staff, decrease inappropriate CPR and free up the time of busy critical care staff to look after patients who would benefit from their expertise.",

Certainly we now have a Scotland-wide DNACPR form with supporting documentation for clinicians, patients and families. e ReSPECT tool is also available from the Resuscitation Council (UK) website along with a guide on how to implement its use and a list of other sites across the UK who currently use it. Now is not the time to reinvent documentation but to use the tools we have and ensure we are having early and frank discussions with patients and their loved ones about their wishes, co-morbidity and frailty and what this means for them. COVID-19 brings its own separate issues with changes to advanced life support practices to limit viral exposures and with a marked increase in futility in a treatment which was never intended for patients suffering from irreversible conditions 3 .",

It is our role to explain what these treatments mean, the burden they bring, and address common misconceptions. We must make clear to patients that their comorbidity and or frailty may preclude them from intensive treatments-now in a time of crisis more than ever. I hope we can use the communication skills we will develop over the coming weeks and months to continue to have these discussions early at the front door and make this a matter of routine in all medical admissions to remove some of the taboo that currently exists around discussing death, dying and advanced care planning.
