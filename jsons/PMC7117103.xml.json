Since then, BToV has been established as a causative agent of diarrhea in cattle (Duckmanton et al., 1998a, Koopmans et al., 1991, Liebler et al., 1992, Pohlenz et al., 1984, Scott et al., 1996). The tropism of BToV for the intestinal tract and its genomic structure are similar to those of another member of the Coronaviridae family, bovine coronavirus (BCV); both viruses contain genes encoding the following proteins: RNA polymerase, spike (S), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) (Draker et al., 2006).",

Similarly, the affinity of BToV for the tissues of the respiratory tract has been reported (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1991, Vanopdenbosch et al., 1992), although these finding are still unclear due to possible contamination of the reagents used (Cornelissen et al., 1998). In addition, a study conducted at a single farm in the United States showed the presence of BToV in both fecal and nasal swabs from feedlot cattle, suggesting that BToV infections may occur in cattle via the nasal route (Hoet et al., 2002). However, no surveys concerning with the relation between respiratory symptoms and the detection of BToV have been conducted in wide range.",

Seven BToV-N-positive samples, referred to as rBToV-1 through -7, were identified in six herds from five prefectures (Table 1b). Compared to the report from the U.S. feedlot, in which BToV was detected in almost all of the cattle during the first 21 days after arrival (Hoet et al., 2002), the frequency of BToV-positive cattle in this study was significantly lower. The reason of this difference is unclear at present as the sampling condition (population size, nature of farms, sampling period) between Hoet et al. and our study differ considerably. Supporting this idea, Hoet et al. (2002) reported that newly arrived feedlot calves became infected with BToV soon after arrival and shed BToV in their feces and nasal secretions; however, secretion of the virus disappeared according to the calves acquired immunocompetence against BToV. Compared to the detection situation of BCV among the 311 samples, the detection of BToV was restricted to symptomatic calves. In addition, the detection rate was less than half that for BCV; however, our results support the notion that BToV is shed in nasal secretions as well as in feces, and that like BCV, the virus is able to infect its host via oral and nasal routes.",

The BToV-N-positive samples were collected over a relatively long period of time (year-round except during the warmest season) but all were calves that between the ages of 1 and 8 months developed clinical symptoms (Table 1b). Among the rBToVs, rBToV-1 was also positive for BCV while rBToV-5 was also positive for Mycoplasma bovis. These samples were additionally examined for several other pathogens known to be associated with respiratory disease (M. bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida); however, negative results were obtained for the cattle that were positive for rBToV-2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 (data not shown). Therefore, although the etiological role of BToV in the development of respiratory disease is unclear, BToV may be a predisposing factor for and/or causative agent of bovine respiratory disease in young cattle. Additional field and laboratory studies are needed to elucidate the etiological significance of BToV in bovine respiratory disease.",

Accordingly, the existence of two distinct viruses in a single herd, as in the case of rBToV-4 and -5, has not yet been reported. rBToV-1, -2, and -3, however, were identical despite the data having been collected during different seasons. These results suggest diversity among domestic rBToVs in terms of their geographic and genetic characteristics. In contrast, Smits et al. (2003) reported a case of intertypic recombination between BToV and porcine torovirus within the HE region that was observed in B150 and B155. However, although HE exhibited a somewhat higher degree of diversity compared to S, none of the domestic BToVs were overwhelmingly diverse as the variety observed in B150 and B155 (Table 2b).",

The two viruses are antigenically related to each other, and PRCV is believed to have originated from TGEV by the deletion of the S gene, leading to a difference in tissue tropism (Laude et al., 1993). As our analysis of the S gene was incomplete, we cannot exclude the possibility that respiratory-derived BToVs possess such distinct features compared to fecal-derived BToVs. However, considering the preservation of the HE coding region, the BToVs detected in the respiratory tract in this study did not show dramatic divergence with the fecal-derived BToVs compared to the level of divergence observed between TGEV and PRCV but rather similar to the situation in bovine enteric/respiratory coronavirus; bovine enteric coronavirus and bovine respiratory coronavirus are not currently distinguishable on the basis of this fundamental property.",

Fecal samples from cattle sharing an origin with rBToV-2 that caused diarrhea were also positive for BToV N, S, and HE. In addition, the sequences of the N, S, and HE genes from these concurrently detected BToVs were identical (data not shown). This implies that the BToVs present in the respiratory and intestinal tracts in this case were identical and supports the idea that BToV possesses dual tropisms (to both the intestinal and respiratory tracts), similar to BCV. In conclusion, while we confirmed the possibility of respiratory tract transmission for BToV and a possible association with respiratory disease in young cattle, its etiological importance in cattle still remains obscure. Further investigation into the interactions between BToV and various tissues, viral persistence, and the immunological responses of infected cattle are needed to clarify the relationship between intestinal and respiratory disease and BToV infection. Isolating BToVs capable of being propagated by cell culture (preferably cytopathogenic) and investigating the immunological responses of infected cattle as well as their antigenic properties are of the utmost importance.",
