Ricin toxin attachment to KCs and LSECs was almost completely blocked by lactose, but very little by mannan, demonstrating that toxin attachment is mediated by RTB even though actual toxicity of KCs and LSECs is mannose-sensitive and therefore mediated by the mannose receptor or another C-type lectin (see main text).",
