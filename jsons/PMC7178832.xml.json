Acute or uncompensated anemia causes tissue hypoxia not only as a result of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, but also as a result of decreased cardiac output from deficient preload. In order to maintain oxygen delivery, tissues will compensate for reductions in oxygen carrying capacity by increasing regional blood flow. Most tissues are also able to increase oxygen extraction in response to decreased oxygen delivery. While the cardiac circulation has extremely high oxygen extraction ratio at rest (60\u201377%), its vasodilatory capacity in response to increased demand is limited. Under normal physiologic conditions, the heart relies on sympathetic discharge, increasing myocardial contractility, heart rate, and systemic vascular tone to further compensate for decreased oxygen delivery. When there is left ventricular dysfunction and/or coronary artery disease, the ability of the heart to increase cardiac output and coronary artery blood flow in response to severe anemia is compromised. Thus, anemia is poorly tolerated in the setting of cardiovascular disease.",

Alloimmunization occurs more frequently in patients who receive multiple RBC transfusions throughout their life.

Today \u201ccellular nutrients\u201d are added, increasing the lifespan of the stored product from 15 to 35\u201342 days. Nonetheless, RBCs stored ex vivo still undergo biochemical and morphological changes (RBC storage lesion) that hinder RBC transport and oxygen delivery. During storage, the erythrocyte is deprived of energy and a series of morphological changes occur including the loss of the normal biconcave disc shape with crenation and spicule formation producing echinocytes. The swelling of echinocytes forms spheroechinocytes. Eventually, the cell sheds its spicules as lipid vesicles and spherocytes are formed. Spherocytes, with their low surface to volume ratio, are unable to deform and transverse the microcirculation, and their increased osmotic fragility results in hemolysis. In addition, endogenous antioxidants are lost resulting in damage to cytoskeletal proteins and membrane phospholipids. Hemoglobin is also converted to methemoglobin which cannot bind oxygen. Finally, stored erythrocytes are depleted of 2,3-diphosphoglyerate (2,3-DPG) increasing oxygen affinity, and thus, hindering offloading of oxygen to tissues.",

The optimal hemoglobin concentration for these children remains unknown. Subgroup analysis of patients in the TRIPICU study with congenital heart disease following cardiac surgery found similar results in those treated with a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy. It appears that children undergoing biventricular repairs, once adequate hemostasis has been achieved, can tolerate anemia like their non-cardiac counterparts.\nHowever, children with single ventricle physiology and mixing cardiac lesions causing cyanosis were excluded from this analysis. In children with cyanotic cardiac lesions secondary to intracardiac right to left shunts, chronic hypoxia promotes increased erythropoiesis to maintain tissue oxygen delivery. Postoperatively, these children have been managed historically with the goal of maintaining higher hemoglobin concentrations in order to ensure adequate tissue oxygen delivery. This practice is now being questioned as the risks of RBC transfusions are increasingly recognized. Adult and pediatric studies have found independent association between increased number of RBC transfusions and worse clinical outcomes following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Additionally, over-correction should be avoided since polycythemia may actually decrease oxygen delivery. Polycythemia may result in \u201csludging\u201d of the red cell mass at the capillary level thereby impeding blood flow to distal tissues. The only prospective study exploring RBC transfusion strategies in children with single ventricle physiology undergoing palliative procedures focused on infants and children undergoing bi-directional Glenn and Fontan procedures. Children managed with a restrictive transfusion strategy appeared no different from those maintained at higher hemoglobin levels. Larger prospective studies, and those including neonates undergoing stage 1 palliations are needed.\nAnemia in cyanotic children should be prevented, but not overcorrected as polycythemia may actually decrease oxygen delivery by \u201csludging\u201d of the red cell mass at the capillary level, and impede blood flow to distal tissues.\n",

There is also a concomitant risk of bleeding secondary to hemodilution of coagulant proteins and a cytokine-driven inflammatory response to the bypass circuit. Individual physiology, the degree of cyanosis, and post-operative hemodynamic instability may further contribute to the coagulopathy experienced by these children.
