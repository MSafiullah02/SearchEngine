Besides of that, who emigrate are not the \"poor among the poor\", but people with certain economic means to be able to afford the trip and contacts in the place they are going to. What is more important, according to me, is to argue that the best way would be to encourage migrants to stay home, preventing massive uncontrolled displacements, is addressing the factors that drive emigration of their own origin countries. To stop unwanted migration, the developed countries must promote a profound democratic and economic stabilization and development. We must always remember that the first right of every human being -after the right to live-is the right not to emigrate and to have the opportunity of living peacefully and prospering in our own home, as Pope Pius XII wrote in the Apostolic Constitution Exsul Familia: \"All men have the right to a family living space in their place of origin\". The right to emigrate is only subsidiary to the main right to have a family living space in the place of origin, when this cannot be assured.",

Since it is not a cyclical, but a structural phenomenon, which means that whatever the method put forward migration cannot be stopped. Currently, according to the UNO estimates, 258 million people live outside their country of birth (3.4% of the world's population). In 1970, about 2% of the world's 3.7 billion people lived abroad (UNHCR 2017) . This figure grows due to inequality, climate change, conflicts, and the interconnectivity that facilitates the movement of people. 1 Migration itself affects values, identities, cultures, assimilation capacities of societies, and, far from being a problem in se, it may be a solution to many problems; e.g., benefits the demographic catastrophe present in the aging Western societies. But it doesn't always engender positive changes; it may also show important disadvantages. This is why immigration must be orderly, capable of duly regulating the massive arrival of people; otherwise our social protection systems will not resist. The illegal immigration requires proper vetting to identify criminals and terrorists-the crime rates of the foreign immigrant population are significantly higher than those of the natives-, and sometimes, to put in metaphorical terms, surgical excision procedure without anesthesia will frequently induce pain. No country needs a Trojan horse. But we will leave this so interesting aspect for another parliament.",

Its 23 \"objectives\" were peppered with vague declarations, platitudes and split differences, such as the fight against the mafias that deal with human beings, the defence of the rights of immigrant workers or a change in narrative about migration towards a more positive approach. Partly in the spirit of other global agreements like the Paris climate deal, it encouraged states to co-operate on tricky cross-border matters without forcing them to do anything, and urged governments to treat migrants properly, but also to work together on sending them home when necessary. At least, it may help build the trust between \"sending\" and \"receiving\" countries that is the foundation of any meaningful international migration policy (Economist 2018).",

Some African prelates within the Catholic Church are calling attention to the most forgotten aspect of this debate: the terrible damage made by a massive escape of young people from countries that desperately need them in their struggle for development. In a book released recently, cardinal Robert Sarah, currently prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, 4 declares his personal position on immigration: \"All migrants arriving in Europe are crammed, without work, without dignity. Is this what the Church wants? The Church cannot cooperate in this new form of slavery into which mass immigration has become\" (Sarah 2019a, b; Indelicato 2019).",

Consequently, their priority has to be to invest in the countries of origin, because migration control has to be paid with money: financing, companies, information, facilitating their institutional, social, political and economic conditions in order that nobody will be obliged to leave their home, and creating sources of employment in those countries of origin. Some political party has proposed in its program that the EU should prepare a sort of \"plan Marshall\" for Africa, similar to the one USA did for the post-war Europe. 5 3 According to the Spanish Royal Academy (RAE) dictionary, buenismo is the attitude of who reduces the seriousness of conflicts, acting with excessive benevolence and tolerance. This \"goodism\" is a demagogy destined to hold power through emotional blackmail, quite different to a real goodness, born of charity or philanthropy (Robles, 2019) . 4 Cardinal Robert Sarah is a native of Guinea Guinean who grew up under a harsh Marxist dictatorship and became archbishop at the age of 34 with the task of guiding the diocese of Conacry, when still in his country there was the socialist regime of Sekou Tour\u00e9. So, I think he knows what he's talking about. 5 In the forties of the last century, America passed the Economic Co-operation Act, better known as the Marshall Plan, because its inspiration from a speech at Harvard University by George Marshall, America's secretary of state. The Marshall aid, aimed to revive Europe's war-ravaged economies, encouraged the Europeans to quash inflation and to narrow their deficits while eventually dismantling price controls and import barriers. These reforms had enormous benefits. Before 1948 fear of inflation and taxation prompted German farmers to feed their harvests to their cattle, rather than It is not enough with assigning cooperation funds. As De la Concha stresses (2019), a proper management of migration flows requires working as much as possible in cooperation with the countries of origin taking into account, as appropriate, the various causes of migration (economic, security, political prosecution, climate, etc.). Thus, a more ambitious measures are required, such as generating opportunities for the local population and offering fiscal incentives to the investments of European companies in those regions that seem to be condemned to diaspora. This move will also offer new markets for European products and services, as well as opening of EU markets to exports from these countries. And, what is more important, besides of contributing to the economic development of those countries, Europe has to improve their social and political quality of life, which is precisely what they try to find in Europe. Our main objective, therefore, has to be to strength the production base and the creation of jobs in the countries of origin, the provision of basic services (health, education) to the local populations, and the literacy, ensuring that students in their countries have the tools to decide their future and thus avoid the temptation to migrate to Europe, avoiding future victims (De la C\u00e1mara 2019). 6 Either we offer them opportunities in their own countries, or they will come to ours looking for them Zalba (2014).",

This is the stance taken by the Visegrad Group (V4) (Check Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia): instead of uncontrolled massive immigration, we have to act in their origin countries; instead of importing problems, exporting help in situ. This attitude would also be \"much more inexpensive\", as is honestly admitted by Juho Eerola, a Finn of the Nordic Freedom, or by the then Slovak prime minister, Peter Pellegrini, during his first visit to Brussels: \"what we have to do is to invest in the countries where the problem is originated. Each euro spent in northern Africa is more efficient than 10 spent in the migrants who arrive massively to EU\" (Eerola, 13 April 2018). But, there is need to build up conditions to create secure environment within the transit African countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

Its true significance laid not in the cash it provided but in the market-friendly policies it encouraged. To receive aid, European governments had to commit to restore financial stability and to remove trade barriers. 6 We have a similar problem within our own countries, migration towards big cities is up siding the living in small rural areas; we have to stop it offering them \"the needed modern technology to have the best of both worlds.

Nowadays, after cashing from them, the immigrants are taken in safe boats from African territorial waters, until they know that the ship of some NGO is a few miles away. Then, once in international waters, they put on life jackets, crammed them in zodiacs, which can barely sail a few hours and warn by radio that there are shipwrecked people in the area. The more rescue boats they have, the more immigrants will try to cross the Mediterranean\u2026, and the more deaths, drowning in the sea, those claimed heroes of the goodism will provoke. A NGO director denounced on television that although he had managed to rescue 60 people from a zodiac, another 340 had perished. What nobody asked was if he did not realize that by telling those who leave Libya that there are boats a few miles away they are contributing to the death of hundreds of people who, for one reason or another, cannot be picked up. 9 Trafficking in human beings to the European destination is more profitable than drug trafficking: it moves around the Mediterranean, according to the latest UN report published last year, about 7 billion dollars. Just take the account: boats for 30 people are used for 120, crammed, standing, and almost unable to move for hours. At 4,000 e per head, 10 it gives 480,000 e per trip. It is paid in two parts: the first 2,000 e to take them from their country of origin to the ports of Libya and the other 2,000 to move them to European port, in an offshore mothership, and then in small boats that launch into the sea in a point located by GPS where they can be picked up by the rescue boats of the NGOs, or by merchants, fishing or recreational. If they do not find this type of boats in the area, they make a distress call with a satellite telephone with the coordinates. If the trip is frustrated and they are returned to their countries, they try again when they have collected the money. And several thousand have not even had that opportunity because they have lost their lives. With that turnover, there is no problem in paying the corresponding bribes in each place (Fern\u00e1ndez Arribas 2019).",

All of them have recruitment agents from the main groups that are victims of extortion. A second level is that of the local mafias, who know the land and generally pay the collectors. One more step is that of small-scale service providers: trucks, boats and other means of transport. The most dangerous level is that of the big international mafias, who control the entire process and also add links to large international crime groups and use immigrants as a way to earn money quickly and easily. Infrastructures built for the exploitation of the mineral resources of the desert, oil in Libya and uranium in Niger, facilitate trips through the desert. According to reports from the Spanish Police, Nigeria and Libya are the most active and most established bases of immigration mafias in Central Africa, with ramifications in other countries, where Sudanese mercenaries act unscrupulously.

Their aim is a reform of the Dublin Regulation and the help of the other EU countries in the sharing of the irregular immigration arriving to the outer borders.

Based on that, the German home minister, Horst Seehofer, wants to send tens of thousands of migrants to Italy, and, on the contrary, Italian home minister, feels legitimized to send those who arrive to the northern European countries; f.ins.,\"France was to welcome 9,816 immigrants, but in reality accommodated only 640\" (France has returned to Italy 10,949 people in 2018). 16 Following the principle of solidarity, which is included in the Lisbon Treaty (2007), Jean-Claude Juncker called on the Member States of the EU to share refugee quotas according to the wealth of each country and population size, but it shattered and the European policy of immigration and asylum was marked by increased sovereignism in the States of Europe.",

In Sweden, immigrants received ample food and shelter, a generous welfare benefits, 1.5 times higher than the ones received by host taxpayers, as well as many facilities for family reunification, without any special focus on their social integration. Even more, most of them are not allowed to work. This almost open bar policy, paying migrants to do nothing, has produced (a) an increment of the social expenses on the foreign population, with the consequent reduction of the benefits for the natives -the newcomers have priority to the Swedish people; 23 (b) a call effect on other tentative immigrants; and (c) increase of criminality and insecurity, which triggers the anti-immigrant feelings of host taxpayers who feel swamped.",

This will extend the rules covering foreign graduates to vocationally trained workers, cautiously opening the door for rejected applicants for asylum, but who are already integrated into the labor market, and recruit more workers from outside the EU with medium and high education to find qualified work under certain conditions. Germany economy enjoys enviable health, registering an unemployment rate of 4.8%, the lowest since the reunification of the country. Figures from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), under the Ministry of Labor, estimate that there are about 1.2 million jobs vacancies, while posts actually registered in employment offices in November 2018 amounted to 807,000 (35,000 more than the same month of the previous year).",

Unlike in other European countries, small and medium-sized German companies are distributed throughout the country, not necessarily concentrated in industrial centers. This often hinders the recruitment of workers who prefer to live in urban areas. There is a shortage mostly of workers with a level of professional training, such as plumbers, or drivers, and diploma courses, for example, of children's educators. Elderly care and tourism, are also crying out for workers.",

These projections will also affect Eastern Europe, where a good part of foreign workers in Germany come from and whose arrival is expected to decrease in the coming years. According to Thomas Liebig, expert on migration issues at the OECD, \"these countries are becoming places of immigration. We have to look for workers outside the EU\". Although the labor integration of immigrants advances, experts warn that it will take time. \"It's a slow process; sometimes they are people who do not speak a word of German, and many of them come from Afghanistan or Somalia, where they have not had schooling\" explains Liebig (2018) . Tangible achievements, indeed! Milanovic and Branco (2018) proposes an intermediate position between open to all or closed borders, under the name of \"circular migration\": to admit workers who cover specific positions, having salaries and work conditions similar to those of the locals, but with not vote rights, nor social benefits for children, retirement or free education; and at the end of their contracts, they will have to return to their countries. In few words, they will be partial citizens for a limited time, like it is already happening elsewhere: in Gulf, Singapore, Iraq, USA, Canada. Perhaps one country may need extra workers and be in position of offering them stable working conditions; but this may not occur in other EU members. This is also suggested by Alejandro Portes, Princess of Asturias of Social Sciences Award 2019: offering a temporary, flexible and comprehensive program of visas to allow access to young people who want to come to work or study for a while, allowing a fruitful flow between countries. Come in that way would also be much more economical, and would do a lot of damage to the traffickers, because those who come in that way would not have to pay them (17 October 2019).",
