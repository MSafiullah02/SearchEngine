This natural process has been mimicked in vitro through recombinant technology to generate various virus-like particles (VLPs) and small subviral particles that exhibit similar structural and antigenic properties of their authentic viruses. Therefore, such self-assembled, polyvalent, and highly immunogenic VLPs and small subviral particles are excellent subunit vaccines against individual viruses, such as the VLP vaccines against the hepatitis B virus, human papilloma virus, and hepatitis E virus, which have already been in the markets. In addition, various antigens and epitopes can be fused with VLPs, small subviral particles, or protein polymers, forming chimeric mono-, bi-, or trivalent vaccines. Owing to their easy-production, uninfectiousness, and polyvalence, the recombinant, chimeric vaccines offer a new approach for development of safe, low-cost, and high efficient subunit vaccines against a single or more pathogens or diseases. While the first VLP-based combination vaccine against malaria has been approved for human use, many others are under development with promising future, which are summarized in this commentary.",

            "text": "Unlike the traditional live-attenuated or inactivated/killed virus vaccines that needs a cultivation of infectious virions, the recombinant protein-based, non-replicating subunit vaccines do not involve in an infectious agent in their production processes and therefore, are considered to be safer than the traditional vaccines. In fact, many viruses, such as human noroviruses (huNoVs), cannot be cultivated efficiently to date, 1 making vaccine development against huNoVs difficult and therefore, subunit vaccines the only choice. In other cases, highly virulent viruses, such as poliovirus and variola virus, are risky to cultivate in large scale, making the subunit vaccine approach a safer choice. Other scenarios, in which the subunit vaccine approach is helpful, include the development of vaccines against malaria caused by a large protozoan parasite and other non-infectious diseases caused by certain protein factors of humans, such as hypertension and cancer. In these circumstances, a self-assembled, polyvalent, and highly immunogenic viral particles or protein polymers are used as a platform to increase the immunogenicity of the specific antigens of pathogens or the protein factors that cause the diseases. These chimeric vaccines are combination subunit vaccines that can be designed and used as mono-, bi-, or even trivalent vaccines against one or more pathogens and/or diseases. Development and productions of subunit and combination subunit vaccines through a well-established expression system, including recombinant bacteria, yeast, baculovirus in insect cells, and/or various viral or plasmid vectors in mammalian, avian, or plant cells, are considered to be more cost-effective compared with those of traditional live-attenuated or inactivated/killed virus vaccines. Thus, the subunit vaccine approach would help to extend vaccine distribution more widely to developing countries and remote areas, where the vaccines are usually highly demanded.",

            "text": "Homotypic interactions of viral capsid proteins and subviral particle and polymer formation Over the long-course of evolution, viruses have developed a common feature to assemble themselves efficiently during viral replication, in which the viral structural proteins are able to spontaneously assemble into spherical or rod-shaped capsids after the viral capsid proteins are produced in host cells. The basic driving force behind these self-assembled capsids is homotypic interactions of the viral capsid proteins. In many cases, heterotypic interactions are also required to assemble more complex capsids that are composed of more than one viral structural proteins. These unique features of viral structural proteins have been utilized to generate various virus-like particles (VLPs), small subviral particles, and/or protein polymers in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2) through one of the well-established recombinant protein expression systems. To date, at least 30 different VLPs, small subviral particles and/or polymers representing more than 20 viral families have been generated (for reviews see Refs. [2] [3] [4] .",

For example, expression of the major huNoV capsid protein (VP1) via recombinant baculoviruses in inset cells formed huNoV VLPs. 5 Most of currently generated VLPs are made by a single capsid protein (for a review see [2] [3] [4] ). However, in some cases, more than one capsid proteins are required to assemble more complex VLPs. For instance, double-layered VLPs of rotavirus (RV) can be made by co-expression of VP2 and VP6 proteins using the baculovirus expression system, 6 while triple-layered RV VLPs can be generated through constitutive co-expression of VP2, VP6, and VP7 in stably transfected high-5 insect cell lines. 7 The most complex recombinant VLPs are the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) VLPs that were made by co-expression of 4 structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, simultaneously using the baculovirus system. 8 These data suggest that VLPs of other viruses may also be generated based on the same self-assembly principle and appropriate expression approaches.",

[9] [10] [11] Similarly, expression of the truncated P1 and P2 domains of hepatitis E virus (HEV) VP1 forms 23 nm-particles, named E2 particles. 3, 13 In addition, the homotypic interaction feature of viral structural and other proteins have also been employed to generate different protein polymers through DNA recombinant technology (Fig. 2) . These include 1) lineage polymers through fusion of 2 dimeric proteins together; 14 2) network polymers via fusion of 3 dimeric proteins covalently; 14 and 3) agglomerate polymers through fusion of an oligomeric protein with a dimeric protein (Fig. 2) . 15 The driving forces behind these protein polymer formation are the intermolecular dimerization and/or oligomerization among the homologous proteins. These different VLPs, small subviral particles, and protein polymers have been further studied as vaccine candidates (see below).",

Foreign antigens or epitopes can be incorporated onto these VLPs, small subviral particles, or protein polymers for immunogenicity enhancement, 2,27-31 resulting in chimeric combination subunit vaccines against both pathogens that provide the platform and the inserted antigens or epitopes (Fig. 1B) . 27, 30, 32 The vaccine RTS,S/AS01 or Mosquirix (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) against malaria is one of such combination vaccines that has reached the market. It consists of the HBV HBsAg VLPs 21 containing a portion of Plasmodium falciparum-derived circumsporozoite protein (CSP) with a liposome-based adjuvant. 30, [33] [34] [35] It should be noted that, although the Mosquirix has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for active immunization of children aged 6 weeks to 17 months against malaria, the World Health Organization (WHO) did not recommend inclusion of this vaccine in the Expanded Programme of Immunisations (EPI) due to the rapidly decline of the vaccine protection, particularly in infants and the potential risk of meningitis as adverse effects. [33] [34] [35] [36] Other combination vaccines based on the same principle have also been developed and reached the stage of clinical trials. For example, the vaccine CYT006-AngQb (Cytos Biotechnology AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) that consists of VLPs covalently coupled with angiotensin II epitope for therapeutic treatment of hypertension has reached phase II clinic trial. 37 Another example is the vaccine NicVax (Nabi Biopharmacetuicals, Rockville, Maryland) that is composed of nicotine in form of hapten 3 0 -aminomethylnicotine conjugating to the exoprotein A complex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 38, 39 to reduce or eliminate physical dependence to nicotine has reached the phase III clinical trial (http:// phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=100445&p=irol-news Article&ID=1586001&highlight). A further example is the vaccine VAX102Q (VaxInnate, Cranbury, New Jersey), a recombinant flagellin protein (a TLR5 ligand) with 4 tandem copies of M2e epitope of influenza virus fused at the C-terminus. [40] [41] [42] A phase II clinical trial is ongoing to test the efficacy of the vaccine as a universal vaccine against influenza virus (http://www.biocentury.com/companies/vaxinnate_corp).",

This issue can be solved by fusing these antigens or epitopes onto a large, polyvalent, and highly immunogenic VLP, small subviral particle, or protein polymer platform for improved immunogenicity as combination vaccines. While successful combination vaccines have been reported, challenges have also been encountered. Generally, while larger antigens contain more authentic antigenic features and are more immunogenic, they are less compatible with viral particle-based platforms compared with smaller epitopes that are easier to be incorporated onto the viral particles without compromising the stability of resulting chimeric vaccines. Therefore, a balance between the 2 factors need to be considered for the best vaccine outcomes.",

On the other hand, the protein polymers themselves are made by different antigens (Fig. 2) and thus exhibit a much larger capacity and flexibility to incorporate larger antigens, however, the resulted polymer sizes may be dispersed, which may need better quality control for unified vaccine outcomes. In summary, further development of different vaccine platforms with favorable features and continual identification of new effective antigens and epitopes will facilitate the advancement of combination subunit vaccines against different human diseases.",

The viral proteins are generated as monomers that can self-assemble into dimers and then a subviral particles via homotypic interaction of the viral proteins. Intermolecular disulfide bonds (red bars) may be introduced to stabilize the particle formation. (B) Application of the subviral particle as a polyvalent platform for a combination subunit vaccine development. A foreign antigen (red ball) is inserted to the top surface of the viral protein. Through dimerization and particle formation, multiple copies of the antigen are presented on the outermost surface of the subviral particle as a combination bivalent vaccine.associated with HPVs (Gardasil1, Merck & Co., New Jersey, USA; Cervarix1, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) 17-20 and 2 hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) VLP vaccines that are composed of the small surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) against HBV infection (Recombivax HB1, Merck & Co., New Jersey, USA; Engerix-B1, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK).",
