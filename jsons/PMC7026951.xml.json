            "text": "Since the late 1940s, chloroquine was the mainstay for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Heavy use of chloroquine, however, led to the emergence of P. falciparum parasites resistant to chloroquine in Southeast Asia and South America. The resistant parasites that first emerged in Southeast Asia spread to East Africa (Tanzania and Kenya) by 1980 [1, 2] and eventually across the malaria endemic regions of Africa [3]. Chloroquine was, therefore, withdrawn/discontinued for routine treatment of P. falciparum malaria in nearly all malaria endemic regions. However, with widespread discontinued use, numerous molecular-epidemiological studies showed that there was return of chloroquine susceptibility in P. falciparum field isolates [4]. This is supported by ex vivo [5\u201316] and in vivo drug-susceptibility studies [5, 17, 18]. Findings suggest that chloroquine might be re-used in the future as an option for the treatment and/or chemoprophylaxis on the condition that chloroquine sensitivity is maintained in the area. As the parasite is \u201cskilled\u201d in evading anti-malarial treatments, continuous surveillance on longitudinal persistence of chloroquine susceptibility by molecular and phenotypic analysis [8, 16, 18, 19] is needed.",

Several studies in different regions in Uganda reported high prevalence of ex vivo chloroquine resistant parasites (IC50s \u2265 100 nM) accompanied with high prevalence of lysine to threonine change at position 76 (K76T) in pfcrt [21\u201324]. However, a recent study showed recovery of chloroquine susceptibility in Eastern Uganda, Tororo; average IC50s decreased from 248 nM in 2010\u20132013 to 33 nM in the community and 57 nM in the hospital setting in 2016 [10]. Here, to investigate whether chloroquine sensitivity also recovered in other regions in Uganda and, if so, to examine the persistence of chloroquine sensitivity, ex vivo drug susceptibility studies for a 6-year period since 2013 in Gulu, Northern Uganda were performed. Results show that chloroquine susceptibility stably persisted during the study period with a significant decrease and eventual absence of the chloroquine resistant K76T alleles in pfcrt.",

To evaluate parasite growth, thick smears were made from drug free culture after 72 h of incubation and the number of schizonts counted. If less than 5 schizonts were seen per field, the test samples included in that plate were not used for further analysis. Drug sensitivity was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that quantifies parasite histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2) [30]. The effective concentration needed to inhibit P. falciparum growth by 50% (IC50) was determined by non-linear regression using an online ICEstimator software (http://www.antimalarial-icestimator.net) [31]. The quality of the ex vivo drug assay was evaluated based upon the level of fitness to the expected shape of the curve obtained by the inhibitory sigmoid Emax model [31].",

To see whether other polymorphism(s) besides those at position 72\u201376 played a role in the recovery of chloroquine susceptibility, entire sequences of pfcrt in 56 samples were analysed. IC50s were also successfully obtained in 44 samples (Table 3), in which 31 (71%) bore only wild-type alleles of the gene. The second (n = 5, 11%) most common haplotype, HP-4, corresponds to a prevalent mutant haplotype (CVMNT + A220S + Q271E + R371I) in Africa [3, 35]. Remaining eight parasites harbored minor haplotypes, all with wild type allele K76 and displayed IC50s to chloroquine of 18\u201335 nM. A previous study (16), has implicated C356R in the sensitivity recovery of chloroquine in the K76T-harbouring parasites, however this mutant allele was not found in the study area. These results further confirm the expansion of wild K76-harbouring parasites as the cause of chloroquine susceptibility reversal in the studied area, rather than additional mutation in the pfcrt gene.",

            "text": "The prevalence of K76 allele in pfcrt rapidly increased from 67% in 2013 to complete fixation in 2017. This is most probably due to K76-harbouring parasites outcompeting the K76T-harbouring parasites because of fitness advantage in the absence of chloroquine selection pressure, as previously observed in Malawi [36, 37]. Indeed, recent transfection studies also show that K76T confers a substantial fitness cost to parasites [35, 38]. This fitness cost can be partly explained by a functional impairment in haemoglobin digestion and subsequent reduction in the supply of amino acids in K76T harbouring parasites [39]. In another possible scenario, a back mutation from T to K at position 76 in pfcrt may potentially induce chloroquine sensitivity. As an example, the chloroquine-susceptible 106/1 clone had mutant alleles at positions 74 and 75 but showed wild-type K allele at position 76 (CVIEK) [40]. The only difference in the pfcrt haplotype at position 72\u201376 in this clone and the widely prevalent chloroquine-resistant haplotype (CVIET) is at amino acid position 76. In the present analysis, however, no such haplotype (CVIEK) was found, negating this possibility. Also, no evidence of additional mutation in pfcrt such as C350R which has been reported to be associated with the restoration of chloroquine susceptibility [16] was obtained. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that neither back mutation nor additional mutations in pfcrt was associated with the observed recovery of chloroquine sensitivity in the study area.",

In contrast, present results revealed that prevalence of ex vivo chloroquine-resistance and K76T alleles were already 6% and 29%, respectively, in 2013, indicating a faster recovery or re-emergence of chloroquine sensitive strains in the region. Despite the government\u2019s move to change the national treatment policy, chloroquine might be used as self-treatment and/or prophylaxis. Such chloroquine use potentially creates various levels of chloroquine selecting pressure in the region, which would be one of the important factors that affects the speed of recovery of susceptible parasites [43]. However, countrywide anti-malarial survey reported no considerable difference of chloroquine use between Tororo and this study area [44\u201346], suggesting that this could not be a main factor for the observed findings.",

In Tororo, this regimen was widely used in different drug trials for malaria treatment [47, 48] and chemoprevention [24, 49\u201352]. Previous studies indicated that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment selected the N86Y allele in pfmdr1 in Uganda [48, 52\u201354], albeit one study questioned this association [55]. Approximately one-third of parasites possessed the N86Y in 2010\u20132013 in Tororo [9], which was much higher than that found in the studied area (2%). Since N86Y is associated with chloroquine resistance, it might be plausible that the N86Y mutation selected by piperaquine played a role in the slower recovery of chloroquine sensitivity in Tororo.",

This occurred at the same time when substantial reduction on the pfcrt K76T mutation was observed, particularly between 2014 and 2015. One possible explanation would be an increase in lumefantrine usage results in the selection of these alleles in this area. Indeed, previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that artemether\u2013lumefantrine treatment selected for these alleles (pfcrt K76 and Y184F) in Africa including Uganda [24, 60, 61]. In the present study, IC50s for lumefantrine were significantly higher in pfcrt K76 harboring parasites than those harboring K76T; while, Y184F allele did not show significantly high IC50s for lumefantrine, consistent with previous transfection study that revealed no association of Y184F mutation to in vitro lumefantrine susceptibility [59]. Thus, in vivo selection for Y184F allele after artemether\u2013lumefantrine treatment may be because of mechanisms other than susceptibility to lumefantrine.",

This observation implies the possibility of future clinical trials for potential re-use of chloroquine as an option for malaria treatment or prevention. Such trial was performed in Malawi where longtime stable chloroquine susceptibility has been evidenced and has revealed that weekly chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine showed 78% lower risk of clinical malaria than intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [62]. Similar trial in Uganda would provide an insight into potential re-introduction of chloroquine. However, further evidence of long-time persistence of return of chloroquine susceptibility is warranted in other endemic areas in Uganda before the implementation of clinical trials.",
