The outbreak further exploded in Europe and America in mid-March 2020 to become a global health emergency. We reviewed recent published articles and on-line open messages on SARS-CoV-2-positive infants and children younger than 20 years of age. Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults. Twelve critically or mortally ill children were found in the published or news reports before April 6, 2020. Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has not been proven definitively. However, six early-onset (<7 days) and 3 late-onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the literature. We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread. Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19. Multidirectional investigations are crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.",

It then turned out to cause serious endemic and epidemic pneumonia with rapid deterioration to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality in complicated patients. The first case was identified on December 8, 2019, and this disease was initially reported by China to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. 1,2 On March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic because of the rapidly increasing numbers of infected cases throughout countries in Europe and America, and the confirmed case numbers reached more than 125 000 cases. 3 From December 2019 to February 2020, the highest confirmed case number was in Hubei, China, followed by a gradually increasing number in Asia. In the beginning of February, an outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess off the coast of Japan occurred. A total of 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive by February 20, 2020. 4 Subsequently, an explosive outbreak started from a religious group in the end of February 2020, and the Republic of Korea temporarily became into the second largest confirmed COVID-19 country after China on March 2, 2020. 5 Since early March 2020, the confirmed case number has increased rapidly in Italy and Iran, and subsequently in many other countries of Europe and America. Importantly and disconcertingly, the pattern of confirmed cases and deaths has shown a terrible and exponential increase since the middle of March ( Fig. 1 ) around the world. 3 At 16:56 (Taipei time) on April 7, 2020, the report of the confirmed COVID-19 case number in the world reached to 1 350 841 with 74 870 deaths in 184 countries/ regions. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) reached to 5.5%. 3 The United States became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 368 449; deaths = 10 993; CFR = 3.0%), followed by Spain (n = 136 675; deaths = 13 341; CFR = 9.8%). 6 The highest CFR remained at 12.5% in Italy (n = 132 547; deaths = 16 523). 6 China remained with the highest number of confirmed cases in Asia during the past 3 months (n = 82 697; deaths = 3335; CFR = 4.0%). Fighting COVID-19 has become a true war of saving human lives all over the world.",

These cases were reported from 39 countries/regions, and most of the cases were from China in that period of time.

According to the report based on the passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the estimated asymptomatic proportion was as high as 17.9%. 11 In one report of childhood cases, 94/731 (12.9%) SARS-CoV-2-positive children had no symptoms according to nucleic acid tests, and more than 70% of them were between the ages of 6 and 15 years. 12 The proportion of asymptomatic subjects may be underestimated because many potentially infected people do not receive a SARS-CoV-2 test when they have no symptoms. However, asymptomatic carriers have the potential to transmit the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. 13 It has been proposed that up to 80% of infected people are asymptomatic carriers. 14 Further investigations should be carried out to clarify this issue regarding the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers.",

It was initially thought that children may be less susceptible to In one report by Wu and McGoogan 2 enrolling cases from December 8 to February 20, 2020, only 1% of teenagers and 1% of children younger than 10 years old in China were affected. 2 In a recent report from United States up to March 16, 2020 , no intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or deaths among persons aged \u226419 years were reported among a total of 4226 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The authors summarized that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups, in close agreement with other reports. 16 However, more and more young people have been diagnosed along with the pandemic progression of the disease and the development of rapid COVID-19 testing techniques. Currently, we know that young people also can be seriously affected by SARS-CoV-2. 5, 17 Most children became infected after close contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients, either family or other members of the public. Some of them had travel histories to epidemic regions. The published reports in children with COVID-19 are summarized in Table 1 , and most of the publications analyzed cases from China before April 2020. 12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In Vietnam, one 3-monthold infant was reported. 21 As shown, fever is the most common initial symptom in children, followed by dry cough. 12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Other symptoms of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, muscle and nervous system, and fatigue were all reported, but some infected children are completely symptom free. 12, 18, 20, 23 In moderate to severe cases, dyspnea and hypoxia could occur and require various types of respiratory support.

Among them, one 10-month-old female infant died of multiorgan failure. 23 Additionally in China, one 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 who died on February 7, 2020, was mentioned among 731 confirmed children (CFR = 0.14%), but there was no detail description. 12 To summarize this information, severe or critical cases occurred more often in small children, and the prevalence seemed to be less than 10% among infected children. The CFR was less than 1% in SARS-CoV-positive children and infants according to current reports.",

[35] [36] [37] [38] [39] According to these publications, cesarean sections are usually the delivery method of choice when the mother has symptomatic COVID-19. Most of the reports regarding specimens collected from amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, or breastmilk samples revealed that nearly all were negative for SARS-CoV-2. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] However, early-onset (<7 days) neonatal COVID-19 was found in a few neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers ( Table 4 ). Zeng et al 35 reported three SARS-CoV-2-positive neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 (Table 4 ). 34 All three of these confirmed babies were symptomatic, including fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, and pneumonia on chest images. Their nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on days 2 and 4 and negative on day 6 or 7. Additionally, both Lu and Shi 17 and Yu et al 41 also reported a total of three infected neonates born from infected mothers, and they were positive for SARS-CoV-2 tests at the ages of 30 hours, 36 hours, and 5 days after birth. Therefore, the possibility of vertical transmission from an infected mother cannot be completely excluded. Additionally, late-onset (\u22657 days) neonatal COVID-19 was reported in three neonates between the ages of 15 and 19 days. The infectious sources included their infected mothers (n = 2) and a housemaid (Table 4) . [42] [43] [44] Close contact with infected persons after birth is the most probable transmission route of these late-onset neonatal COVID-19 cases. All of these reported SARS-CoV-2-positive neonates recovered after management. Although current published reports reveal that children develop Table 3 SARS-CoV-2-positive children and teenagers younger than 20 years old in Taiwan from January 10 to April 7, 2020 10 less severe cases of COVID-19 than adults, critical deterioration or death did occur. Asymptomatic children are not tested usually for SARS-CoV-2 in many countries, so the prevalence of infected children is underestimated in the current reported data.",

Although not as prevalent as those of 20-to 30-year-old adults, the social activities of teenagers, including international travelling, are still eventful. That may partly explain why the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in teenagers is much higher than that in small children, according to data from the TCDC. In infanthood and toddlerhood, the major contacts of small children are further narrowed to their family and caregivers, and thus their COVID-19 incidence seems to be the lowest. Nevertheless, we still need to monitor all children carefully when the COVID-19 pandemic is under today's explosive outbreak in many countries.",
