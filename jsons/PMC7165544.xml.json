The difference, however, was not significant. Although Sugiura et al. suggested that PIV type 3 is responsible for PVOD, PIV type 3 was not found in our present study. The reason for this discrepancy may be twofold. First, the titers for PIV type 3 in patients not only with PVOD but also with posttraumatic or rhinosinusitis increased in the report of Sugiura et al., and they did not find significant differences.\n12\n Second, it could be that the number of samples in this study is low. In addition, PVOD can be caused by canine PIV infection in dogs.\n13\n Although canine PIV shares structural features with human PIV type 3, it is most closely related to human PIV type 2.\n14\n Considering this, PIV type 2 could potentially be responsible for PVOD.",

This study showed that RVs, PIVs, and EBVs can be a possible cause of dysosmia, suggesting that RVs, PIVs, and EBVs cause olfactory dysfunction through mechanisms other than nasal obstruction. This study also demonstrated that olfactory dysfunctions were not improved at 4, 8, 11, and 24 weeks after the first visit in four patients with RVs, although the results of acoustic rhinometry significantly improved, suggesting that nasal obstruction is not the only cause of olfactory dysfunction secondary to RV infections.",

No PCR products were detected in 9 of the 24 patents. We may have found more viruses if the samples had been collected within less than 72 hours after the onset of olfactory dysfunction. In this case, however, the number of samples would have decreased. No virus was found during the second visit, suggesting that the viruses found in this study are not resident or present before URI. This may also hint at a relatively low sensitivity of this test. This study did show, however, that RVs, CoVs, PIVs, and EBVs were all present in nasal discharge of patients with PVOD and decreased with the improvement of the common cold despite the possibility that the test has a relatively low sensitivity. Also, evidence of a specific virus in the nasal cavity is not equal to the persistence of the virus within the olfactory cells. It has been shown that epithelium can be safely biopsied.\n15\n Therefore, future studies will be aimed at investigating viruses in biopsies of the olfactory region from patients with PVOD. Further studies are expected.",

A second reason is that many patients visit the clinic long after onset of olfactory dysfunction, believing that postURI olfactory dysfunction will improve without treatment, just as the other symptoms, such as sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal obstruction. This may explain why studies such as this have not yet been reported. However, this study demonstrated the potential of RVs, CoVs, PIVs, and EBVs to be causes of PVOD. This should provide some insight into the mechanism of PVOD onset and contribute to the development of a new therapeutic approach to treat PVOD.",
