In an attempt to clarify this, HBoV was sought for in HBoV-infected children after they had recovered from respiratory disease, and in hospitalized children with no respiratory symptoms. Human bocavirus was no longer detectable in the second nasal washings taken 8-12 days after the first in HBoVpositive children, suggesting a limited period of viral shedding in children with bronchiolitis. In a recent report, 15 persistent HBoV shedding for over a month was observed in patients with significant underlying diseases; however, follow-up tests were not performed in otherwise healthy children. Differences between studies could, perhaps, be accounted for by the fact that this study did not include children with underlying medical problems that could cause immune suppression and prolonged HBoV shedding. Several studies reported no or few cases of HBoV infections in asymptomatic populations or differently symptomatic control populations but often without age matching and using different types of specimens. 16 In the present study, children hospitalized for non-respiratory diseases were tested for HBoV, using the same type of specimen, taken by the same physicians, for several months during the study period. Human bocavirus was detected in 2 \u2044 21 children; these patients had symptoms (gastroenteritis or exanthema) similar to those described previously in HBoV infections. [17] [18] [19] There are a number of possibilities that could account for these non-respiratory HBoV infections: hospitalization due to an HBoV-associated disease; HBoV infection before hospitalization, together with other pathogens; HBoV nosocomially acquired, as reported in infants hospitalized since birth. 18 In this study, HBoV was not detectable in the plasma of eight children affected with bronchiolitis, during HBoV acute infection. An Italian paper 9 reported HBoV viremia in only one child with gastroenteric symptoms, while two patients with respiratory disease tested negative. On the other hand, HBoV was detected in 53% of 43 acute-phase serum samples and in 19% of the 43 convalescent-phase serum samples from wheezing children; 14 the authors concluded that the occurrence of HBoV viremia was associated with HBoV high viral load in respiratory samples and linked in time with episodes of acute wheezing. More series of samples, with accurate quantitative analysis of HBoV DNA, will be required to clarify the issue of HBoV localized or systemic infection during ARI.",

No differences in the amino acid sequences were found, possibly due to low variability in HBoV in NS1 and NP1 genes. In fact, only two closely related genotypes have so far been described and most nucleotide differences are in the VP1 \u2044 VP2 genes. 18, 20 In conclusion, these data together seem to indicate that HBoV is a widely circulating respiratory virus that infects patients mainly in the first year of life, probably causing subclinical manifestations and occasionally severe respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Nevertheless, because of its high prevalence in children, HBoV's etiological role cannot definitely be proven without isolating the virus and testing for immunity. Future prospective studies using standardized procedures for sampling and quantitative detection of viral particles are essential to study HBoV's pathogenicity and biological properties, and eventually to establish a correlation between viral load and the severity of clinical symptoms.",
