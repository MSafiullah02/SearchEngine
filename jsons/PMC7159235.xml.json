Despite their protein-coding disruption, it has been shown that some LoF variants can be tolerated in healthy individuals [1\u20134]. Genes harboring homozygous LoF variants are called LoF-tolerant genes. Multiple studies have shown the average number of LoF variants ranges from 100~200 per individual [5\u20137]. In addition, MacArthur et al estimated that on average there are 20 LoF-tolerant genes per human genome [5]. Such lists of LoF variants have greatly aided gene prioritization in disease studies by providing functional references for variants [8\u201312]. It also enabled estimations of gene indispensability by providing a confident set of LoF variants and LoF-tolerant genes in human genomes [5, 13].",

            "text": "Such \u2018shadow\u2019 enhancers are defined as the ones that have similar functions to the proximal primary enhancers but locate at distal locations [18]. It has been observed in Drosophila that while deleting one enhancer may not cause phenotypic changes, deleting both the primary and the secondary enhancers leads to fitness defects [18\u201320]. It has also been shown that deletion of some individual enhancers in mice did not significantly affect their fitness, but deletion of pairs of enhancers regulating the same gene led to abnormal limb development, indicating the redundancy of enhancers leads to robustness in gene expression [21]. Thus, it is thought that the phenotypic effects stemming from the loss of a single enhancer in humans may be mitigated by the activity of another enhancer, whose function is redundant to the deleted one, and is therefore only apparent if both enhancers are deleted [22]. These studies may lead one to the interpretation that loss of an individual enhancer is not likely to produce strong phenotypic effects. However, it has been shown that alterations at single enhancers are linked to rare Mendelian diseases [23\u201326]. Thus, based on our current understanding, the phenotypic effects of enhancer LoF likely fall into a spectrum where deletion of LoF-tolerant enhancers would not elicit substantial phenotypic impact, while some enhancers are likely to cause fitness defects even when single enhancers exhibit LoF. A prioritization scheme based on LoF-tolerance scores of enhancers can help identify causal sequence variants at enhancers in disease studies. Mutations (single nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels) and structural variants (SVs)) at enhancers with high LoF-tolerance are less likely to produce fitness defects while variants at enhancers with low tolerance to LoF are more likely to be disease-causing. Such prioritization scheme will not only help understand the causal variants of Mendelian diseases, it will also provide insights for the many non-coding susceptibility loci found by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [27\u201331] of which the potential causations beneath the associations are still unknown.",

We built an integrated regulatory network, MegaNet, in which the nodes consist of enhancers and genes. The edges between enhancers and genes correspond to tissue-specific regulation and those between genes include protein-protein [32], metabolic [33], phosphorylation [34] and signaling interactions [35]. To conservatively define the LoF of enhancers, we used deletions from 2,054 whole-genomes to identify enhancers that can be homozygously deleted without obvious fitness defects as LoF-tolerant. We trained a random forest model to learn the characteristic properties of disease-causing potential of enhancers in MegaNet to predict the LoF-tolerance of all enhancers in the human genome. Thus, the LoF-tolerance scores of enhancers provided in this study can significantly facilitate the interpretation and prioritization of non-coding sequence variants for disease and functional studies.",

Availability of tissue-specific annotations has also enabled the construction of tissue-specific regulatory networks. Cao et al. utilized enhancers identified from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects [14\u201316]. They collected ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, DNase-seq together with ChromHMM-predicted active enhancers to generate a union set of enhancers. Using this set of enhancers, they developed a computational model considering the joint effect of the above enhancer features and their correlation to the gene expression to predict the enhancer-target regulation. Importantly, they used ChIA-PET, Hi-C and eQTLs as the gold standard to train their model and connect enhancers with their downstream target genes [41]. In order to systematically evaluate the LoF-tolerance of enhancers in tissue-specific regulatory networks, we collected 246,028 unique enhancers predicted to regulate 19,170 genes from enhancer-target networks [41]. We constructed an integrated mega network (MegaNet) for joint assessment of the enhancer properties in the enhancer-gene regulation networks [41] and gene centrality in the gene-gene interaction networks [13]. The gene-gene interactions in MegaNet consist of protein-protein interactions obtained by high-throughput yeast two hybrid system [32], metabolic interactions obtained by compound-reaction based interactions [33], phosphorylation interactions by direct kinase-substrate interactions [34] and signaling interactions from SignaLink [35].",

Since samples in the 1000 Genomes Project consist of individuals without strong disease phenotypes [3, 42], we define enhancers that can be homozygously deleted in those individuals as LoF-tolerant enhancers. This is similar to the approach used previously for identification of LoF-tolerant genes [1, 2, 5]. More specifically, to identify the LoF-tolerant enhancers, we identified deletions which occur homozygously in at least one individual among the 2,504 from the 1000 Genomes Project [43] and intersected them with enhancers. In order to avoid bias introduced by protein-coding regions, deletions that overlap coding exons were excluded. While deletion of parts of enhancers may also lead to loss of their activity, we used a conservative estimate of LoF-tolerant enhancers by only including those that are completely deleted in a homozygous manner. In line with this, our approach also does not include LoF of enhancers by SNVs due to the difficulties in predicting their functional impact. In total, 886 enhancers are identified as LoF-tolerant. The number of LoF-tolerant enhancers per individual genome ranges from 8 to 78 (S1 Fig).",

            "text": "In order to train a model that can predict LoF-tolerance scores for all enhancers, it is useful to have a list of enhancers that are less likely to be tolerant to LoF besides the list of LoF-tolerant ones. Although some disease enhancers have been causally related to fitness defects as discussed in the Introduction, they constitute a small set and most other disease enhancers have been identified to be associated rather than causally linked to diseases. Thus, the known set of causal disease enhancers do not provide a large enough set for model training. Another set of enhancers that has been extensively explored for functional importance is those that exhibit extreme evolutionary conservation and are called ultra-conserved enhancers [44]. Initially, it was reasoned that the extreme conservation might be the result of strong negative selection due to the potential functional importance of these elements [45]. However, besides one early study, which showed that deleting a conserved enhancer causes perinatal death in mice [46], most follow-up studies have shown that ultra-conserved enhancers are not likely to be essential in terms of viability. For example, it was shown that deleting ultra-conserved enhancers is not lethal and upon checking a limited number of phenotypes, their deletion did not show visible abnormalities either [47]. However, further follow-up studies found that even though deletion of ultra-conserved enhancers did not cause perinatal death, mice that survived the deletions did show signs of developmental defects after more comprehensively inspecting for phenotypic changes under different conditions. For example, deleting a conserved and Shh regulating enhancer resulted in degenerations of skeletal elements in limb bud [48] and deleting an ultra-conserved limb-developmental associated enhancer led to significantly decreased body size in mouse embryos [49]. Dickel et al showed that single enhancer deletions of three out of the four enhancers regulating the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX/Arx) gene led to decreased overall growth or brain abnormality in transgenic mice [50]. Thus, our current understanding is that while the loss of ultra-conserved enhancers is not likely to be essential in terms of viability, it is likely to lead to fitness defects, which may be subtle under limited laboratory conditions but are selected against during evolution [50]. Therefore, we compiled 49 low-LoF-tolerance enhancers which exhibit extreme conservation and enhancer activity in mouse embryos and are highly likely to cause fitness defects if deleted [44, 51].",

In addition, genes regulated by LoF-tolerant enhancers are more dispensable (lower average gene indispensability score, GISa) compared to genome-wide expectation and low-LoF-tolerance enhancers. In order to account for enhancers with the same average EGTU, but different variance, we also analyzed the variance of EGTU. Both average edge tissue ubiquity (EGTUa) and its variance (EGTUv) are lower for LoF-tolerant enhancers, indicating that their interactions tend to be more tissue-specific (Fig 1B). Overall, these observations indicate that LoF-tolerant enhancers are in general less versatile in the genome and tend to target specific genes in specific tissues.",

We observe that low-LoF-tolerance enhancers contain more TF motifs, followed by GW, which is followed by LoF-tolerant enhancers (Wilcoxon rank sum test P-values in S8A Fig). This may be related to the higher activity at low-LoF-tolerance enhancers for robustness of the expression of their target genes. We then calculated the enrichment for each motif for LoF-tolerant and low-LoF-tolerance enhancers compared to GW. We observe significant enrichment of 19 motifs in low-LoF-tolerance enhancers (adjusted Fisher exact test P-value < 0.0001). The two TF families with strongest enrichment and lowest p-values are POU domain genes (POU3F1/2/3, POU1F1, POU2F2) and GSX1/2 (S8B Fig). Both of them are involved in neurogenesis [54\u201356]. Motifs of SOX10, which is critical during embryonic development, are also enriched in low-LoF-tolerance enhancers [57\u201359]. The enrichment of motifs for neurogenesis-involved TFs is likely related to the enrichment of low-LoF-tolerance enhancers in brain/neuronal stem cell tissues.",

The process was repeated 50 times to sample all the 886 LoF-tolerant enhancers for training, and the performance of each process was evaluated by stratified 10-fold cross validation (Methods). We thus chose the model from the process which achieved the highest mean area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) as our final model. It achieved an average AUROC of 0.80 +/- 0.129 if evolutionary conservation was not used as a feature and 0.9822 +/- 0.0269 when conservation was also included as a feature. The average AUPRC (area under the precision recall curve) of the final model is 0.9769 +/- 0.0252 (Fig 3A, S4B Fig and Methods). Thus, while inclusion of evolutionary conservation significantly improves the model performance as expected, it performs well even in the absence of this feature. Importantly, a major goal of this study is to decipher the biological differences between enhancers with low vs. high LoF-tolerance as revealed by their network properties, besides the development of the quantitative predictive model for LoF-tolerance scores. Thus, we evaluated the importance of features in the model by mean decrease impurity, which measures the decrease in the weighted impurity of the tree by each feature [60, 61] (Fig 3B and S2 Table). We observe that collectively gene-related features contribute the most to the model (collective importance = 39.4%). Among these features, average gene in-degree of enhancers (GIDa) in neuronal stem cells and average gene indispensability scores (GISa) rank the first. Following the GISa are centrality metrics of genes in the MegaNet such as page rank, degree and closeness centralities. After gene features, evolutionary conservation is next and contributes 31.2%. This is followed by the enhancer properties in MegaNet, including the number of tissues that the enhancers are active in (ETU) and the number of genes they target (EOD), which collectively contribute 19.7%. Finally, the number of tissues that the enhancer-gene regulation edges are active in (EGTU) contribute 9.7%.",

We postulate that many of these enhancers have not yet been detected as LoF-tolerant because of (a) the limited sample size of whole-genome sequences and (b) undetected deletions by short-read sequencing due to the limited mappability of short reads in repetitive and complex regions. In particular, recent studies have pointed out that the map of genomic deletions with Illumina short-reads is highly incomplete. The longer sequencing reads in PacBio technology enabled the detection of many additional SVs (including deletions), particularly in high-repeat regions (24,825 as opposed to 10,884 per human genome) [62\u201365]. We tested the performance of our method on homozygously deleted enhancers obtained from a combination of PacBio long-reads and Illumina short-reads [65]. We found 21 novel enhancers completely deleted in a homozygous fashion in the three individuals sequenced by Chaisson et al. Our model predicted significantly higher LoF-tolerance probability scores for these enhancers than the genome average (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P-value = 3.715e-3, Fig 4A). This result shows that the scores predicted by our model can help with identification of LoF-tolerant enhancers even in the absence of large numbers of whole-genomes and incomplete maps of genomic deletions generated using Illumina short-reads.",

Our power calculations using this sub-sampling approach show that the number of LoF-tolerant enhancers is likely to increase exponentially as more genomes are sequenced (Fig 4B). However, sequencing all human genomes to find all the LoF-tolerant enhancers is still infeasible even with short-reads sequencing, let alone more expensive and time-consuming long-reads sequencing.

Pendred syndrome is a disorder associated with hearing loss caused by abnormalities of inner ear [69, 70]. This enhancer (Enhancer A, Fig 4C) is predicted to have low LoF-tolerance by our model with PLoF-tol. = 0.35 (PLoF-tol < 0.5), consistent with its loss of function leading to the disease.

However, they are still different metrics and enhancers with low conservation can still have low LoF-tolerance. From the disease enhancer set described in the previous section, there are 12/39 enhancers with conservation < 0.065 (median of all enhancer PhastCon scores) [75] yet they are predicted to have low LoF-tolerance by our model. One example is an enhancer regulating the gene SOX10. An SNV (rs533778281) in this enhancer has been shown to decrease the enhancer activity by disrupting SOX10 binding, which in turn leads to Hirschsprung disease [59]. Hirschsprung disease is a birth defect in which nerves in the intestine are not developed normally causing difficulty in intestine movement. The enhancer reported in the study covers two enhancers in our dataset with PLoF-tol = 0.33 and 0.27, hence they are predicted to be low-LoF-tolerance enhancer candidates (S5B Fig), even though the conservation for this enhancer region is low (PhastCon score = 0.024 and 0.062 respectively). The features related to the low LoF-tolerance of these enhancers in our model include high gene indispensability scores (GISa = 0.62 and 0.61 respectively) and regulation of multiple genes in the MegaNet (EOD = 12 and 10 respectively). This example further shows that our model can help prioritize and interpret disease variants using gene and MegaNet features beyond evolutionary conservation alone.",

We describe the differences between LoF-tolerant and enhancers with low LoF-tolerance in the MegaNet. We observe that LoF-tolerant enhancers regulate fewer genes and tend to be more tissue-specific. We also find that the genes regulated by LoF-tolerant enhancers tend to be regulated by more enhancers, indicating enhancer redundancy in the network. We developed a supervised learning method to predict the LoF-tolerance of all enhancers in the human genome.

It is possible that regions excluded from exome sequencing, namely non-coding regions, harbor the variants explaining many of the remaining unexplained cases [79]. Major international efforts such as the UK Biobank and TOPMed (NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine) aim to use whole-genome sequencing to uncover disease variants [4, 80\u201384].

As an example, a mutation may lead to loss of activity giving it high functional impact score but that might not lead to fitness defects. We calculated the variance of FunSeq2 scores of mutations in each enhancer (S7A Fig). The FunSeq2 score varies within each enhancer for the same predicted LoF-tolerance scores. We also show this using a specific enhancer as example (S7B Fig). Thus, for researchers investigating the function of non-coding variants in enhancers, methods like FUN-LDA and FunSeq2 can be used to find the functional effect scores of their mutations, while our scoring scheme can be used to further check how well losing the enhancer will be tolerated by individuals. Another important difference of our approach is that LoF-tolerance scores can be used to predict the consequences of structural variants (such as deletions) that are likely to disrupt enhancers by predicting how well the loss of enhancer would be tolerated.",

In total, we used 12,939 deletions from the PacBio structural variants set that were present in the three children (HG00514, HG00733 and NA19240) from the trio family and intersected them with 1000 Genomes Phase 3 deletions. There are 11,118 novel deletions with less than 80% overlap with the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 deletions. Out of those novel deletions, 21 of them can delete enhancers completely from our enhancer set.",
