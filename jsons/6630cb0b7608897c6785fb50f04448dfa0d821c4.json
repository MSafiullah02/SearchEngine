Pregnant women are prone to a range of fetal and maternal complications that could impact the outcome of any concurrent infection. 1 The first trimester bears a major risk for miscarriage and fetal developmental abnormalities.

We excluded reviews, meta-reviews, letters to the editor, and guidelines that are specific to a region. We then reviewed the results for relevance and included the articles that reported on SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant patients. This search strategy resulted in 19 case reports and articles from the primary literature that we included in this review. We added one study outside the aforementioned date range due to its novelty and relevance to the subject at hand. We extracted saturation postpartum. 8 Among 13 patients, Y. Liu and colleagues (2020) reported that one patient developed Multi Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 9 Karami et al.

Importantly, there are no contraindications for vaginal delivery as evidenced by the uncomplicated vaginal delivery in at least five patients. 23 24 It is not clear from this review if the high Cesarean section rate is warranted.",
