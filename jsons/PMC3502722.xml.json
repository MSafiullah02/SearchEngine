The small numbers of patients further precluded correlation of URTI or duration of shedding with transplant associated variables, and limits our ability to draw conclusions on the implications of asymptomatic detection of respiratory virus in the transplant setting.

Inferences on causality, based on detection of HRV and hCoV in symptomatic HCT patients, should be made with caution, since these viruses are shed and detectable in asymptomatic patients. Future studies using a quantitative detection approach with viral load cutoffs to determine which children with asymptomatic shedding prior to transplant are predisposed to develop symptomatic disease are warranted. This may have implications for infection control in pediatric HCT units.",
