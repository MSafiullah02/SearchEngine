Coronaviruses are the causal pathogens for a wide spectrum of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in both wild and domestic animals, including birds, pigs, rodents, etc (Dhama et al., 2014). Previous studies have found that six strains of coronaviruses are capable to infect humans, including four strains circulating yearly to cause common cold, and other two strains which are the source for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), respectively (Dhama et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2019).",

The first batch of patients infected by 2019-nCoV were almost all connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which also trades wild animals. Later, contact transmission of 2019-nCoV among humans was confirmed, and the number of infected patients increased rapidly in Wuhan as well as other major cities in China. A series of actions have been taken by the Chinese government to control the epidemic of the virus, and effective medical methods are in urgent needs to prevent 2019-nCoV infection and cure the disease.",

Besides encoding structural proteins, majority part of the coronavirus genome is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide, which encodes proteins essential for viral replication and gene expression (Lai and Holmes, 2001). The \u223c306 aa long main protease (Mpro), a key enzyme for coronavirus replication, is also encoded by the polypeptide and responsible for processing the polypeptide into functional proteins (Lai and Holmes, 2001). The Mpro has similar cleavage-site specificity to that of picornavirus 3C protease (3Cpro), thus is also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) (Gorbalenya et al., 1989). Studies have shown that the Mpros of different coronaviruses are highly conserved in terms of both sequences and 3D structures (Xue et al., 2008). These features, together with its functional importance, have made Mpro an attractive target for the design of anticoronaviral drugs (Anand et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2008).",

The protein sequences of SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro are 96% identical (Fig 1\nA), and the spatial structure of the previously reported lopinavir/ritonavir binding pocket is also conserved between SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro (Fig. 1B). During the submission process of this manuscript, the crystal structure of 2019-nCoV Mpro was solved (PDB ID: 6LU7), of which the lopinavir/ritonavir binding pocket region is nearly identical to our predicted model (Fig. S1). The conserved amino acids Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119 (numbered according to positions in SARS-CoV Mpro because the present sequence of 2019-nCoV Mpro in GenBank is in polypeptide form) formed the binding pockets for lopinavir/ritonavir in the spatial structure of both SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro, whereas the nearby non-conserved amino acids locate far away from the binding pocket, thus would not affect its structural conservation (Fig. 1B). Virtual docking of lopinavir/ritonavir to 2019-nCoV Mpro also showed high binding ability to the pocket site (Fig. 1C), similar to previous report for SARS-CoV Mpro (Nukoolkarn et al., 2008). Amino acids Thr24, Thr26, and Asn119 were predicted to be the key residues for binding the drugs (\nFigs. 1C and S2), forming 2 hydrogen bonds with lopinavir and 3 hydrogen bonds with ritonavir, respectively.",
