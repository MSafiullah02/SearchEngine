This principle applies to peptide hormones as well. They are regulated by proteases (otherwise called peptidases, proteinases or proteolytic enzymes) that generate and metabolize them [13], [14], [15]. The human genome encodes several hundred proteases, of which the function of many has not yet been determined. Peptidases involved in processing of angiotensin peptides have been collectively termed \u201cangiotensinases\u201d. While the term has largely been used to infer degradation, it is now know that these enzymes can generate active angiotensins. Angiotensinases are comprised of three groups of peptidases: amino-, endo- and carboxypeptidases. Aminopeptidases have traditionally been viewed as the most important group, accounting for 60\u201390% of angiotensinase activity in various tissues [16] however, it is now known that angiotensin peptides are processed by a broad variety of peptidases.",

In the brain, the primary source of angiotensinogen is astroglia which are reported to constitutively secrete it into the extracellular fluid of the brain [18]. By the classical pathway of the RAS it is cleaved by renin (EC 3.4.23.15) between Leu10\u2013Leu11 residues to yield angiotensin I (Ang I) (Fig. 1\n) [6], [19], [20]. Renin is an aspartyl peptidase of the A1 family. In the brain of rodents and humans renin is expressed in two forms: one is that secreted either as active renin from the secretory/storage granules, or is formed extracellularly from secreted, inactive prorenin. The other form is a more recently described non-secreted, brain-specific intracellular renin, which in comparison with secreted renin is expressed in much higher amounts in the brain tissue [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26].",

ACE is one of the most extensively studied mammalian peptidases. It exists in soluble and membrane-bound forms, and is a member of the M2 family of zinc metallopeptidases. ACE possesses dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity and can selectively convert Ang I to Ang II, des-Asp-angiotensin I to Ang III, Ang 1\u20137 to Ang 1\u20135, and bradykinin to its inactive metabolite, in addition to metabolizing several other peptides [15], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. However, ACE does not metabolize Ang II, presumably due to its inability to metabolize the His6\u2013Pro7 bond [43]. The soluble form of ACE is distributed extracellularly while the membrane-bound form is on the external face of the plasma membrane. Thus the formation of Ang II from Ang I by ACE is thought to occur extracellularly only [44].",

Ang-(1\u20139) can be further metabolized to Ang II by cathepsin A [7], [45] (Fig. 1). Cathepsin A is a multifunctional lysosomal, acidic, serine carboxypeptidase (S10 family) that also functions as a protective and an activator protein for neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase [47], [48], [49]. Cathepsin A also acts as an esterase/C-terminal deamidase at neutral pH and both carboxypeptidase and esterase/C-terminal deamidase functions are fully separated from its protective function [50]. ACE2, like ACE, is a member of the M2 family of zinc metallopeptidases, existing in a membrane-bound form and widely expressed in a variety of mammalian tissues including the brain [15], [41], [51]. In contrast to ACE, ACE2 cleaves only a single C-terminal residue from its peptide substrates including Ang I and Ang II, but not Ang-(1\u20139) and Ang-(1\u20137) [43], [46]. Another differentiating feature of ACE2 from ACE is that it is unable to cleave bradykinin and Hip\u2013His\u2013Leu, and is insensitive to ACE inhibitors, e.g., lisinopril and captopril [15], [41]. In addition to its role as a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 is also the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [52], [53].",

Ang III can also be generated from Ang I without Ang II production as an intermediate through formation of des\u2013Asp1\u2013Ang I (Ang 2\u201310) by APA and aminopeptidase X (see also Section 2.5.3), and subsequent carboxypeptidase cleavage of Leu\u2013His by ACE [60], [66], [67] (Fig. 1). APA is a widely expressed mammalian membrane-bound aminopeptidase, a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases [14], [68]. It is abundantly expressed in the brain [69]. The catalytic domain of the peptidase is in the ectodomain of the protein thus it is positioned to metabolize peptides that are in the extracellular milieu. It specifically cleaves acidic residues (aspartic acid or glutamic acid) from the N-terminus of peptide substrates, predominantly from Ang I, Ang II and cholecystokinin-8 [14], [60], [68], [70].",

However, since Ang III is thought to be a fully active agonist at AT1 and AT2 receptors, this metabolic step can hardly be considered to be a degradation. On the other hand, Ang III appears to be highly labile and short-lived [77], [78] so the process of formation of Ang III could be considered to be a prelude to inactivation of the peptide, at least as an AT1/AT2 agonist. Of interest is the observation that Ang IV binds to a soluble form of human APA, but is very slowly metabolized by it, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor [79]. These investigators also reported a small amount of Ang III metabolism to Ang IV by this soluble APA. In addition to its ability to form Ang III from Ang II, the reported ability of APX (likely DAP) to form des Asp1 Ang I from Ang I has been suggested to result in the formation of a physiological antagonist of the AT1 angiotensin receptor subtype [80]. An interesting inference of this observation is that ACE inhibitors could then be prolonging the lifespan of this endogenous AT1 receptor antagonist.",

In cleaving Arg1 from Ang III they form des\u2013Asp1, des\u2013Arg2 Ang II (Ang IV) [14], [83], [84], which is predominantly involved in learning and memory functions mediated mainly by Ang IV receptors [62]. In addition to its ability to cleave Arg1 from Ang III to form Ang IV, APN can also cleave Val1 from Ang IV to form Ang-(4\u20138) (Fig. 1), a putatively inactive angiotensin fragment [85]. APN and APB are members of the M1 family of Zn-metallopeptidases. APN is predominantly characterized as a membrane-bound peptidase with its catalytic site in its extracellular domain [14], [84]. APB is both a secreted and membrane-bound protease [86]. Both APN and APB are ubiquitously distributed in different tissues of mammalian organisms, including brain. APN metabolizes regulatory peptides by removing the N-terminal amino acid with a preference towards, neutral residues. APB demonstrates strict specificity for Arg and/or Lys residues at the N terminus of various peptides. This suggests a dominant role of APB, rather than APN, in the processing of Ang III [14], [84], [86], [87]. However it has been suggested that APN is the predominant enzyme responsible for brain Ang III metabolism in the mouse [88] and rat [89] brain. Besides having peptidase activity, APN has also been shown to be a receptor of coronaviruses, a human herpesvirus and Bacillus thuringiensis CryIA(c) toxin in their target tissues [14], [84].",

Initially, both proteases were considered to be soluble enzymes, of which thimet oligopeptidase predominantly nuclear, while neurolysin was cytosolic. Later it was demonstrated that in rat brain 20\u201330% of thimet oligopeptidase activity is associated with membranes, including plasma membranes, endosomes and synaptic vesicles [94], [111], [112], [113], [114]. Moreover, Shivakumar et al. [95] recently showed that thimet oligopeptidase is associated with AT1 and B2 receptors in kidney cells, both at the plasma membrane and after receptor internalization, suggesting a possible mechanism for endosomal disposition of ligand that could facilitate receptor recycling. In the case of neurolysin, it has now been shown that the enzyme is mainly cytosolic in astrocytes, but is largely membrane-associated in neurons [115].",

Of note, addition of peptidase inhibitors does not always help to protect the ligand from degradation. One of the commonly used peptidase inhibitors in angiotensin receptor binding assays, bacitracin, is reported to activate aspartyl aminopeptidase (DAP) [67]. This would promote its conversion to Ang III, thus distorting the observations of binding kinetics. Moreover, dithiothreitol (DTT) and other disulfide reducing agents are capable of activating thimet oligopeptidase and DPPIII [90], [145], [146], [147].",

However, subsequent studies using angiotensin analogs modified in the 1 and 8 position gave much better results [140], [143], [144], [150], [151], [152]. The most common amino terminal substitution is sarcosine (N-methyl glycine) for aspartic acid. Because sarcosine is a secondary amine, it resists degradation by aminopeptidases. The lack of a side-chain on the alpha carbon also contributes to its metabolic stability since it is a poor substrate for the acid aminopeptidases (APA, DAP) primarily responsible for removal of Asp1 of Ang II [58], [59], [67]. The most common substitution to the carboxy terminal is the introduction of an alkyl side chain-containing amino acid, with isoleucine being the most often used amino acid. The substitution of the aromatic phenylalanine with an aliphatic amino acid converts the peptide to an antagonist [153], [154], although there are reports suggesting that some agonistic properties of the peptide are retained [155].",

Pioneering studies of Glossmann et al. [127], and Bennett and Snyder [128] indicated that the addition of DTT was required for protection of the angiotensin radioligands from metabolic degradation. Later it was shown that DTT had the ability to increase the binding affinity for Ang II in brain with no change in the density of the binding sites [132], [136]. At that period nearly all angiotensin receptor binding studies conducted in brain were carried out in the presence of up to 5 mM DTT. Printz et al. [136] in their paper mention: \u201c\u2026In studies in our laboratories there is no question but that thiols are essential for optimum binding of Ang II by membranes isolated from brain and adrenal medulla\u2026\u201d",

During this time, sulfhydryl reducing agents continued to be widely used in angiotensin receptor binding assays in neuronal but not peripheral tissues. The discovery of angiotensin receptor subtypes led to the revelation that sulfhydryl agents severely impair binding at AT1, but not at AT2 receptors [164], [165], [166], [167]. Recognizing the fact that sulfhydryl reducing agents impaired binding of angiotensin ligands to AT1 receptors, Speth and co-workers [166] in a paper showing sulfhydryl agent-sensitive and non-sensitive (AT1 and AT2 containing) nuclei distribution in the rat brain noted: \u201c\u2026 An inescapable conclusion from these studies, however, is that the vast majority of Ang II receptor binding studies in brain homogenates, and a large number of in vitro receptor autoradiographic studies were carried out under conditions that should have effectively inhibited binding to the AII\u03b1 subtype (today known as AT1). Thus only a portion of receptors were characterized for responsivity to various conditions\u2026\u201d",
