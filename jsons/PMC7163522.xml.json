The 2012 Olympic Games in London were accompanied by the challenges of protecting 348 horses from numerous countries and the broader British horse population 12. This was an overwhelming success, with no significant disease occurrences during the Games 12. On a small geographic but larger horse scale, identification of 2 horses with EHV\u20101 infection at a Canadian racetrack housing over 2000 horses was contained, with no further neurological disease, only 3 other horses with fever, and perhaps most importantly, no evidence of any pathogen transmission after the initial cases were identified (unpublished data). Countless animals have been treated by veterinarians on farms and in equine hospitals with no infectious complications, despite highly susceptible individuals and circulating endemic diseases. A promising vaccine has been produced to help control Hendra virus 13. These are all indicators of advancement of infection control and infection control successes. Thus, while infectious diseases will undeniably continue to pose challenges, there are measures that can and must be implemented to reduce the incidence and impact.",

While some consider \u2018infection control\u2019 and \u2018biosecurity\u2019 to be equivalent terms, there are important differences. There are various definitions of biosecurity, and it can be broadly defined as measures to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission. More often, it is used to refer to measures used to prevent the entry of pathogens into a population. In contrast, infection control aims to limit the impact of the introduction of pathogens into a population. For example, intensive biosecurity practices are widely used in poultry production, with measures such as all\u2010in/all\u2010out production, tight personnel access controls and prevention of wildlife exposure, all designed to minimise the chance that various pathogens enter the farm. At the other end of the spectrum is infection control in a veterinary hospital, where infectious animals are willingly admitted but measures are in place to limit the risk of transmission. While equine farms cover a wide spectrum, very few can practice true biosecurity because of the regularity of horse movement, cross\u2010movement of personnel, the endemic nature of many pathogens and the commonness of latent infections (e.g. EHV\u20101). That does not mean that facilities should not strive to prevent entrance of pathogens. Rather, it means there must be acknowledgement that exposure of the horse population to relevant pathogens is largely inevitable, so measures must be in place to identify and contain any threats, along with measures to reduce the risk of pathogen entry.",

This is not to suggest that minor deficiencies in infection control practices will prompt a welfare investigation, but rather the potential that individuals or facilities that exhibit wanton disregard for the health of their animals and the broader equine population could come under scrutiny from animal welfare or regulatory agencies.",

The impact of new introduction of a less transmissible agent was demonstrated in a study of the cost of a high incidence of West Nile virus infections in North Dakota, USA in 2002, which identified costs to horse owners of US$1.5 million, along with state government costs of US$1.9 million 19. These should be taken as an indication of the potentially profound impact of infectious diseases, yet they focus on very rare occurrences; a rather unprecedented equine influenza outbreak and the initial stages after introduction of an arbovirus into a new region.

Based on a desire to remain \u2018disease free\u2019, different countries have different strategies for import testing and quarantine, and testing of resident horses.

The protective effects of natural immunity and the immune system can be compromised by genetic shifts in pathogens. This is most often discussed in the context of \u2018antigenic shift\u2019 of influenza viruses, whereby a recombination event produces a novel virus to which the host has little or no immunity. Fortunately, equine influenza virus has been rather stable in the equine population, with only the A/H3N8 subtype identified over the past 30 years 41. While antigenic drift, gradual and typically minor genetic variation, has occurred, the impacts of this have been limited because of cross\u2010protection afford by H3N8 vaccination and natural infection. Even though equine influenza H3N8 has been more stable than human influenza viruses, the potential for a recombination event (antigenic shift) should not be discounted. Emergence of a new equine influenza subtype could prove devastating, with the combination of a highly transmissible virus, widespread international horse movement, variable (and often weak) infection control practices and no pre\u2010existing vaccine or natural immunity.

More recently, rinderpest, a disease of ruminants, was eradicated 42. Obviously, eradication of pathogens would be the ideal approach to disease control. However, many factors make eradication of equine pathogens impractical and unlikely. For there to be a realistic chance of global eradication of a pathogen, it must possess various properties (Table 1). Further, the disease must be considered of enough importance internationally to dedicate significant resources and time to an eradication programme, and this must be done in every region where the pathogen is present, otherwise the effort will ultimately be futile. There are few equine pathogens that are viable candidates for eradication, based on disease characteristics or practicality (particularly economic factors). The potential for eradication of strangles has been discussed 43, 44; however, the feasibility of this has been questioned 45, 46. While the ultimate goal of eradication of certain pathogens should be kept in mind, it is questionable whether any equine diseases will be eradicated in the near (or even distant) future. Accordingly, the focus must remain on control of pathogens and prevention of disease.",

The availability of safe and effective vaccines has had a profound impact on equine health, at both individual animal and population levels. Vaccine efficacy is variable, population\u2010based research to guide the most effective vaccination approaches is limited and compliance is sporadic, yet vaccination remains a key component for the control of infectious disease. However, while important, vaccination should not be the cornerstone of an infection control programme. Rather, vaccination should be used to reduce the risk of disease when measures to reduce the risk of exposure are ineffective or impractical.

Yet, there are limited objective data regarding the usefulness of most infection control measures in horses, including longstanding and widely used practices. Important and basic questions remain unanswered, only a few of which are presented in Table 2. Indeed, it is difficult to cite proper studies that have evaluated the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical approaches to reduce infectious diseases in horses. Many reasons account for this. One is the limited number of individuals with an interest in equine infection control research. Limited funding opportunities for evaluation of infection control interventions may also play a role. Practical aspects of study design and implementation also complicate the field. Ultimately, it will probably be impossible to assess some common approaches in controlled studies because of resistance of caretakers to be part of a controlled study and the ethical aspects of using a placebo group to test a practice that is widely considered to be effective (e.g. not cohorting horses in the event of an outbreak). This does not mean that research efforts are futile. There must be some degree of willingness to put in the step beyond current beliefs and challenge current practices, particularly those not supported by studies in other species or with a clear biological basis.",

In others, they are most similar to man or household pets (e.g. travel, potential for encountering numerous outside individuals, potential use of expensive treatment and preventive measures) and in some respects there may be no reasonable comparison with other species. Data from other species should therefore not be ignored but should be used as general guidance or for hypothesis generation, and not typically direct extrapolation.
