As such, safe and effective alternatives are crucially important to the future success of animal health and production. To assess scientific advancements in the research and development of alternatives to antibiotics, highlight promising research results and novel technologies, assess challenges associated with their commercialization and use, and provide actionable strategies to support their development, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with support from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), organized the second International Symposium on Alternatives to Antibiotics. The symposium focused on six key areas: vaccines; microbial-derived products; non-nutritive phytochemicals; immune-related products; chemicals, enzymes, and innovative drugs; and regulatory pathways to enable the licensure and development of alternatives to antibiotics. This two-part manuscript synthesizes and expands on the scientific presentations and expert panel discussions from the symposium regarding the use of vaccines as alternatives to antibiotics that can reduce the need for antibiotic use in animals. Part 1 synthesizes and expands on the expert panel discussions regarding the opportunities, challenges and needs related to vaccines that may reduce the requirement for use of antibiotics in animals, while part two focuses on highlighting new approaches and potential solutions.",

            "text": "As mentioned in part one of this manuscript, most pathogens invade the host at the mucosal surfaces, such as the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract constitutes the largest surface area of the body and is exposed daily to vast numbers of foreign antigens derived from feed, the microbiota and pathogens [1]. Within the intestine a complex cellular network has evolved to prevent unwanted immune responses to innocuous antigens, for instance feed or microbiota, while allowing swift protective responses against agents that cause infectious disease. Key to keeping enteric pathogens at bay is the presence of protective pathogen-specific secretory IgA (SIgA) at the site of entry, which prevents the adhesion of micro-organisms to the intestinal surfaces and neutralizes their enterotoxins. Triggering robust and protective intestinal SIgA responses usually requires the local administration of vaccines [2]. Although live attenuated oral vaccines have had tremendous success, resulting for instance in the near global eradication of poliovirus [3], concerns on the dissemination of vaccine strains into the environment and rare cases of reversion to virulence, leading to vaccine-induced disease, have driven oral vaccine development to nonliving or vectored vaccines [4]. However, oral vaccination is challenging due to several hurdles imposed by the cellular and molecular architecture of the gut: (i) the harsh environment of the stomach and small intestine, including the low pH, digestive enzymes, and bile salts, required to digest feed also easily destroys vaccines, (ii) a poor uptake of vaccine antigens by the intestinal epithelial barrier and (iii) the tolerogenic mechanisms that pervade the intestinal tissues, leading to peripheral and oral immune tolerance upon oral administration of antigens via the induction of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. This often results in a low immunogenicity of oral vaccines and requires innovative strategies to deliver the vaccine antigens to the intestinal immune system as well as the inclusion of adjuvants that promote innate and adaptive immunity [5].",

            "text": "The mucosal immune system in the gut can be divided in inductive sites, where sampled antigens stimulate naive T and B cells, and effector sites, where effector cells perform their functions, e.g. assisting in the production of SIgA. In the small intestine, the inductive sites comprise the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and the mesenteric lymph nodes, while the effector sites constitute the lamina propria and the surface epithelium [6]. The GALT itself is composed of Peyer\u2019s patches (PP), appendix and isolated lymphoid follicles. The presence of other GALT-like structures, such as lymphocyte-filled villi (rat, human) and cryptopatches (mouse) is dependent on the species. Interestingly, while in birds and most mammals PP or their equivalent are scattered throughout the small intestine, in pigs, ruminants and dogs the PP in the distal small intestine (ileum) are continuous. Fish and reptiles on the other hand lack PP and the intestinal immune system in these species is composed of epithelial leukocytes and rare, small non-organized lymphoid aggregates. It remains largely unknown how these species-specific differences might affect the efficacy of oral vaccines.",

            "text": "From their entry point, which is typically the oral cavity, to their delivery site, most commonly the small intestine, the integrity of delivery systems and the stability of vaccine components are at risk. Lysozyme in saliva, the low gastric pH together with pepsin and intestinal proteases can degrade oral vaccines. Enteric coating of vaccine components with pH-responsive polymers with a dissolution threshold of pH 6 might protect against gastric degradation and results in the release of their contents in the small intestine [7]. In this context, ruminants pose an additional problem to vaccine stability as their polygastric gastro-intestinal tract effectively degrades substances including vaccines. Site-specific delivery of oral vaccines to the small intestine is favorable as the mucus layer covering the small intestinal epithelium consists of only one layer, which is loosely adherent, less thick and patchy as compared to the colonic mucus layers and might promote their access to the intestinal epithelium. In addition, the small intestine is less densely populated by the microbiota, which might further disrupt the integrity of the delivery systems and the stability of vaccine components. Underneath the mucus layer, a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells prevents uncontrolled access of the luminal content to the underlying intestinal tissues, further restricting uptake of oral vaccine antigens. Crossing of the epithelial barrier by vaccines could be enhanced by exploiting antigen sampling routes in the small intestine or by adopting strategies used by enteric pathogens to colonize or invade the host [8]. The best-known sampling route in the gut is associated with microfold (M) cells. These specialized intestinal epithelial cells reside within the follicle-associated epithelium covering the Peyer\u2019s patches and take up macromolecules, particulate matter and microorganisms [9]. Many enteric pathogens hijack M cells to invade the host by binding to apical receptors. For instance, the invasin protein of Yersinia species interacts with \u03b21 integrin on M cells, leading to infection [10]. Likewise, GP2 marks M cells in many species and binds to FimH, a subunit of type I pili on Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. This interaction results in uptake of FimH+ bacteria and initiates mucosal immunity [11]. Although many groups have focused on improving antigen uptake by targeting oral vaccines to M cell-specific receptors, these cells represent only a small, species-specific percentage of the total intestinal epithelial cell population. Although M cell numbers increase from the cranial to caudal small intestine and M cell targeting strategies work quite well in rodent models, they mostly fail in larger animals due to the long passage time needed to reach the distal small intestine, where the gut-associated immune system is most pronounced. Besides M cells, sampling of luminal antigens also occurs by intestinal mononuclear phagocytes via transepithelial dendrites. This sampling mainly occurs by CD11c+CX3CR1+ macrophages, which transfer the antigens to CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs). These DCs then drive the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which subsequently induce tolerance to these proteins [12]. In the steady state, goblet cells can also transport small soluble proteins (<10 kDa) across the epithelium to tolerogenic DCs via so-called goblet cell-associated antigen passages [13]. Absorptive intestinal epithelial cells or enterocytes, constituting >90% of the small intestinal epithelium, may also sample the luminal content through receptor-mediated transcytosis. For instance, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), an MHC class I-like Fc\u03b3 receptor, is expressed on the apical surface of enterocytes and transcytoses IgG, immune complexes or Fc-coated nanoparticles from the lumen to the basolateral surface of the epithelium [14]. Similar to M cells, it might be worthwhile to target apical receptors exploited by enteropathogens on small intestinal enterocytes to promote uptake of antigens by the epithelial barrier. A potential candidate would be aminopeptidase N (ANPEP), a zinc-dependent peptidase present in the brush border of small intestinal enterocytes, which serves as an entry receptor for several coronaviruses and also binds F4 fimbriae, a colonisation factor produced by porcine-specific enterotoxigenic E. coli. ANPEP also transports F4 fimbriae as well as microparticles functionalised with ANPEP-specific monoclonal antibodies across the intestinal epithelial barrier, resulting in robust intestinal SIgA responses, at least in piglets [15, 16].",

            "text": "Although the selective targeting of vaccine antigens to apical receptors might promote their uptake by the epithelium via transcytosis, this process is in itself insufficient to trigger protective intestinal immunity upon oral vaccination and explains the need to include adjuvants. These adjuvants should act on antigen presenting cells as well as intestinal epithelial cells to promote the induction of protective SIgA and cell-mediated immune responses. Indeed, enterocytes not only provide a physical barrier separating the intestinal lumen from the host tissues, but also relay information on the luminal content to the underlying immune cells through the secretion of inflammatory or tolerogenic mediators. For instance, during the steady state, enterocytes produce thymic stromal lymphopo\u00ebtin (TSLP) and transforming growth factor (TGF\u03b2), which imprint a tolerogenic phenotype on intestinal dendritic cells [17]. In contrast, upon infection enterocytes secrete IL-6 and IL-8 [18]. This probably facilitates a switch from a tolerogenic to an immune-inductive environment, allowing activation of intestinal antigen presenting cells. As yet the most effective adjuvants for oral application are the enterotoxins from Vibrio cholera (CT) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) (LT). Due to inherent toxicity, dmLT was developed, a nontoxic LT mutant retaining its adjuvanticity. This dmLT triggered intestinal memory responses upon oral vaccination with a nonliving ETEC vaccine and seems a promising candidate to be included as adjuvant in oral vaccines [19, 20]. Similarly promising strategies have been reported for Eimeria [21]. Recent studies have shown that Eimeria-induced IL-17 production is critical in the initiation of early innate immune response in coccidiosis and blocking of IL-17 production by exogenous IL-17-neutralizing antibody reduced both the intracellular development of Eimeria and the severity of intestinal lesion [22\u201324].",

Typical species include Bacillus clausii, Bacillus coagulans and Bacillus subtilis. For a long time, it has been assumed that Bacillus spores are soil organisms yet the evidence supporting this is actually rather sparse. Instead, spores are found in the soil in abundance but live, vegetative cells, are rarely if ever found other than in association with plants or in the animal gut. Mounting evidence shows that spores, although found in the soil, are mostly dormant and are shed in the feces of animals, which are their natural hosts [29]. The consumption of spores associated with soil-contaminated plant matter enables spores to enter the GI-tract, transit the gastric barrier unscathed and then germinate and proliferate in the intestine before excretion as dormant spores [30]. Evidence suggests that spore forming bacteria comprise as much as 30% of the gut microbiota, indicating that the ability to form spores enables bacteria to survive in the environment as well as entering and transiting the gastric barrier of animals [31].",

Spores have been used as vaccine vehicles in a number of ways, differing principally in whether spores are genetically modified or not. In all cases B. subtilis has been utilized due to the excellent genetics available. Using genetic modification, a chimeric gene consisting of a fusion between a B. subtilis anchor gene and an open reading frame encoding a putative protective antigen is first constructed. The next step is introduction of the chimera into the B. subtilis chromosome using a gene transfer technique, typically DNA-mediated transformation, a process in B. subtilis that is straightforward. Typically, the anchor is the 5\u2032-end of a gene encoding a spore coat protein such that the chimera is displayed on the spore coat. Surprisingly, heterologous antigens displayed on B. subtilis spores are mostly stable and do not appear to suffer extensive degradation. Using this approach a number of candidate antigens have been displayed and then evaluated in animal models. For example, spores displaying a tetanus antigen TTFC conferred protection to a lethal dose of tetanus toxin when administered orally [32, 33]. Mice dosed orally with spores expressing part of the alpha toxin of Clostridium perfringens were protected to challenge with alpha toxin [34]. A more recent example is that of Clostridium difficile where a C-terminal fragment of the toxin A (TcdA) could be stably expressed and when administered orally to hamsters conferred protection to C. difficile infection [35, 36]. This particular vaccine has now entered clinical evaluation in humans [37].",

Some of these vectors are inherently non-pathogenic; Lactobacillus and Lactococcus strains, for instance, are \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) [50, 61]. In other cases the microorganisms have been rendered non-pathogenic through the targeted deletion of virulence genes; strategies for the development of Salmonella vectors, for instance, typically rely on the deletion of certain metabolic functions that limit the bacterium\u2019s ability to replicate in the host and attenuate virulence without impacting host colonization or invasion [50]. In fact, an intrinsic property shared by many, although not all, microorganisms used as vectors is their ability to effectively infect the host and initiate innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses, for instance by triggering the host\u2019s pattern recognition receptors [50]. These recombinant vectored vaccines can be delivered directly to a mucosal surface via nasal, ocular, or oral administration, which not only allows for mass application but may also enhance mucosal immune responses, the primary surface through which most pathogens invade.

Similarly, adenovirus vectors have also been widely used in veterinary medicine, both in companion and food-producing animals [65]. Vaccine platforms such as these are particularly valuable as they can allow for the rapid development of vaccine candidates in response to emerging vaccine needs, but the possibility of anti-vector immunity can restrict their usefulness [66]. Research and development of additional vaccine vector platforms is therefore needed. Salmonella strains that express foreign antigens, either chromosomally or plasmid-based, have yielded promising results in several species including mice, humans, pigs and chicken [67\u201372]. Diseases for which these Salmonella vectored vaccines were investigated include influenza, Brucella abortus, post-weaning diarrhea and heterologous strains of Salmonella [69\u201372]. The use of Pasteurellaceae as vectors for modified live vaccines against shipping fever in calves is currently under investigation, with promising preliminary findings [73]. Use of this vector system for other diseases including pinkeye has been suggested [73].",

Eggs are injected in the hatchery, typically during the third week of embryonic development around day 18 or 19. To vaccinate, a small hole is made in the shell at the blunt end of the egg and the vaccine is injected below the chorion-allantoic membrane into the amniotic cavity or directly into the embryo. Commercial in-ovo vaccination systems that automatically inject the eggs have been available since the early 1990s. More than 90% of broiler chickens in the US are vaccinated in ovo, and in Brazil that fraction equals 70% [75]. The most common use of in-ovo vaccination is for Marek\u2019s disease, potentially combined with vaccines against other diseases such as Gumboro or Newcastle disease.",

In addition, the location of the vaccine injection is critical for efficacy. It has been shown, for instance, that if Marek\u2019s disease vaccine is accidentally deposited into the air cell or allantoic fluid, adequate protection is not achieved [77]. The stage of embryonic development can have profound effects on vaccine safety and efficacy [78]. One study, reported that vaccination of 10\u201312 day-old embryos with herpes virus of turkeys (HVT) led to pronounced lesions and embryonic deaths, while vaccination on days 16 did not cause detectable lesions [78]. Embryonic age at vaccination has also been shown to be correlated with antibody titers [79]. Maternal antibody titers actually increase after the typical age for in-ovo vaccinations and peak just after hatch [76]. This can interfere with proper vaccine responses. However, evidence suggests that some vaccine strains are more affected by maternal antibodies than others [80]. Deliberate vaccine development may therefore limit the often disruptive effects that can be caused by maternal antibodies [78]. Other factors that need to be considered in the development of a successful in-ovo vaccination program include the characteristics of the vaccine or vaccines to be used, the type of incubator in which the eggs are housed in the hatchery, and the breed and age of the parent flock [76].",

Importantly, they can provide robust and early protection against immune suppressive diseases such as infectious bursal disease [81, 82] and vaccines against multiple diseases have been successfully combined. For instance, studies have shown that in-ovo vaccination strategies can simultaneously confer protective immunity against Marek\u2019s disease, infectious bursal disease, Newcastle disease, fowl poxvirus, coccidiosis, and necrotic enteritis [83, 84]. Other combination vaccines under investigation include vectored vaccines that simultaneously provide protection against Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease [85]. In-ovo vaccination strategies have also been explored for other poultry diseases with promising results. This included an avian influenza vaccine based on a non-replicating human adenovirus vector [86], a recombinant viral vector vaccine against infectious laryngotracheitis [87], recombinant protein Eimeria vaccines [84, 88, 89] and a fowl adenovirus vectored vaccine against inclusion body hepatitis [90], among many others. A Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccine for in-ovo vaccination of layer chickens has also recently been evaluated, even though high chick losses at hatch were reported for the medium and high doses of the vaccine that were investigated [91]. Therefore, in-ovo vaccination strategies are capable of controlling several economically important poultry diseases. Many of these diseases are viral, but can predispose animals to secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, in many cases, in-ovo vaccines are promising alternative approaches to the use of antibiotics.",

However, this bacterium is also one of the most common pathogens of food-producing animals, causing disease only under circumstances that create an environment which favors growth and toxin production, such as stress, injury, or dietary changes [92]. The bacterium itself is not invasive, but causes disease through the production of a wide array of toxins and enzymes. However, no single strain produces this entire toxin repertoire, resulting in considerable variation in the toxin profiles and disease syndromes produced by different toxinotypes of this bacterium [93]. While some of these toxins act only locally, other toxins which are produced in the gut exert their action in other internal organs or can act both locally and systemically [94\u201396]. To date, efficacious vaccines are only available for the diseases caused by systemic action of the toxins and vaccination against enteric diseases still remains a challenge. However, some of these enteric diseases caused by C. perfringens are of major economic importance and lead to considerable use of antibiotics. Amongst them are necrotic enteritis in broilers and necro-haemorrhagic enteritis in calves. Despite the fact that much research is being directed to the development of novel vaccines against these C. perfringens-induced enteric diseases, several key barriers still have to be overcome.",

            "text": "In general, clostridial vaccines require multiple doses to achieve full immunity. Unfortunately, parenteral booster immunizations are impossible in the broiler industry, where mass parenteral vaccination is only feasible at the hatchery, either in ovo or on day-old chicks. Because single parenteral vaccination at day of hatch offers no protection, other delivery methods need to be developed [97]. Oral vaccines can more easily be administered to birds, without the need of individual handling of the chicks and are therefore recommended. However, some questions arise when developing an oral vaccine as compared to the parenteral administration route. In addition to the fact that maternal antibodies can block the immune response in young chicks, also the induction of oral tolerance has to be circumvented and an efficient way to present the antigens to the mucosal immune system has to be developed. Oral tolerance is a common problem in mammals and fish when developing oral vaccines. This is in contrast to chickens, where oral tolerance is age-dependent, and only an issue in 1- to 3-day-old chicks. After that age, protein antigens have been shown to induce a robust immune response and oral vaccination schemes are thought to be feasible [98]. One appealing strategy for the delivery of vaccine candidates to the mucosal immune system is the use of attenuated or avirulent bacteria as antigen vehicles [99]. Attenuated recombinant Salmonella strains which express C. perfringens antigens have been tested in several studies as oral vaccine vectors, leading to some promising results. However, the amount of protection afforded by these vaccines is not as high as compared to multiple doses of parenteral vaccination, and seems to depend on the colonization level and persistence of the vaccine strain [100\u2013103]. This indicates that the use of live vectors to express antigens derived from C. perfringens strains in the gut of broilers is a promising approach, but the vaccine delivery strategy still needs to be optimized to achieve optimal antigen presentation to the mucosal immune system and provide improved protection. Alternatives to attenuated Salmonella strains can be Bacillus subtilis spores or Lactobacillus casei, which both have a GRAS status and have the potential to be used as vaccine carriers for Clostridium antigens [34, 104]. B. subtilis has the advantage that the heat-stable spores can easily be incorporated in the feed and L. casei has known probiotic effects that facilitate the development of mucosal immunity. However, these types of vectors still have to be tested for their capacity to induce a good immune response, in particular against heterologous antigens, in broilers and whether they are able to provide protection against necrotic enteritis.",

            "text": "Another issue to be addressed when developing a vaccine against C. perfringens-induced enteric diseases is the choice of the antigens to be included in the vaccine. C. perfringens-induced diseases are the result of the toxins and enzymes that are produced and vaccination of chicks with C. perfringens supernatants provides protection against experimental necrotic enteritis [97, 105]. However, the protective capacity of the supernatants depends on the strain used for supernatant preparation, indicating that full protection might be determined by an effective combination of different bacterial immunogens [105]. In order to elucidate the optimal mixture of antigens to protect against necrotic enteritis, challenge trials are being performed mostly using parenteral vaccination schemes. Once the ideal combination of antigens is known, this will have to be adapted to oral delivery strategies. Several C. perfringens antigens have been evaluated as potential vaccine candidates. The tested antigens include both C. perfringens toxins (e.g. alpha toxin and the NetB toxin) and highly immunodominant proteins identified in post-infection serum from birds immune to necrotic enteritis [106]. In general, immunization studies of broilers with a single antigen all resulted in some level of protection against experimental necrotic enteritis. Remarkably, immunization with NetB toxin, which is essential to cause disease in broilers, does not afford higher levels of protection than vaccination with other toxins or proteins. However, when birds were vaccinated either via the parenteral or the oral route, with a combination of both NetB toxin and alpha toxin, higher levels of protection were obtained [107, 108]. In order to obtain full protection against C. perfringens-induced enteric diseases, not only antibodies that inhibit toxin activity might be needed; a combination of antigens targeting also bacterial proliferation, colonization and/or nutrient acquisition could be more efficient than either one of the individual approaches. Indeed, in a recent study disruption of the putative adhesin-encoding gene cnaA resulted in a reduced ability to colonize the chicken intestinal mucosa and to cause necrotic enteritis [109]. This strengthens the idea that vaccine antigens that target bacterial colonization might be indispensable to obtain a working vaccine against C. perfringens\u2013induced enteric diseases. Additional vaccine targets might be enzymes that aid in breakdown of the host tissue and nutrient acquisition, such as, amongst others, mucinases, collagenases and hyaluronidases.",

In calves as in chickens, protection against C. perfringens-induced necrosis can be obtained by antibodies against a mixture of toxins, at least in an experimental model for bovine necro-haemorrhagic enteritis [112]. Furthermore, antibodies against alpha toxin alone, which is essential to cause intestinal disease in calves, are not sufficient to provide the same level of protection as antibodies directed against a mixture of C. perfringens proteins, indicating that a mixture of different antigens will be needed to provide full protection [110]. In order to fully protect calves against C. perfringens-induced enteric diseases, antigens that target bacterial colonization and proliferation might be of equal importance as antigens targeting the toxin activities. Next, it has to be explored whether parenteral vaccination is sufficient to induce a protective immune response or if a combination of systemic and mucosal immunity is needed when not only the bacterial toxins but also bacterial colonization is targeted.",

However, native toxins cannot be used as vaccine antigens due to safety issues. Inactivation of clostridial toxins is generally achieved by formaldehyde treatment, which risks residual formaldehyde in the vaccine preparation, incomplete inactivation of the toxins, and batch-to-batch variation. Moreover, formaldehyde inactivation can induce changes in the tertiary protein structures of relevant antigens and influence the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Indeed, vaccination of both chickens and calves with formaldehyde inactivated C. perfringens supernatants or toxins have resulted in a good antibody response, but these are unable to protect against intestinal disease [97, 112]. To overcome the need of chemically inactivating the C. perfringens toxins, current research focusses on the use of recombinant toxoids to develop a vaccine against C. perfringens-induced diseases. While this may be a good strategy to obtain a safe and protective vaccine on a laboratory scale, the production process is more laborious and time-consuming than production of conventional toxoids, especially because of the required purification steps [113]. Therefore, recent studies have explored the use of efficient low-cost alternatives, such as non-purified recombinant clostridial toxins and even recombinant bacterins, with success [114\u2013116].",

Low levels of parasites survive and induce protective immunity against the prevailing local parasite strains, without causing clinical disease [124]. Anticoccidial drugs provide an efficient means of controlling coccidial parasites and are highly cost-effective. However, drug resistance is widespread and increasing consumer concerns related to drug use in livestock production and residues in the food chain encourage the use of alternatives such as vaccination. Notably, because coccidiosis is a predisposing factor for necrotic enteritis and other secondary bacterial infections, efficient control of this parasite is important to minimize the use of medically important antibiotics, including those deemed critically important for human health, in poultry production.",

Exposure to limited levels of such non-attenuated parasites permits the induction of a natural immune response in the chicken, resulting in protection against subsequent coccidial challenge. However, because protective immune responses against Eimeria are fully species specific, the inclusion of each individual target species is necessary if comprehensive protection is to be achieved, which results in relatively complex vaccine formulations. Such vaccines commonly include between three and eight parasite species or strains. The approach has been highly successful, although the lack of attenuation has been associated with reduced flock performance following vaccination and occasional clinical disease (reviewed elsewhere [126]).",

For most of these vaccines, attenuation was achieved by selecting for so-called precocious strains, which typically exhibit reduced pathogenicity with fewer and/or smaller rounds of asexual replication. These attenuated strains retained their ability to immunize. The first live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine was launched in 1989,2 and several similar vaccines have been developed since using the same approach [126]. Non-attenuated and attenuated anticoccidial vaccines have become popular in the breeder and layer sectors, but are less widely used in the much larger broiler sector due to their relatively high cost compared to anticoccidial drugs and their limited availability. Because Eimeria cannot replicate effectively in vitro, the production of these live vaccines can only be achieved in Eimeria-free chickens and separate chickens have to be used for each species or strain to be included in a vaccine. Despite these production concerns billions of anticoccidial vaccine doses are sold every year, but more would be required to fully meet the growing demand.",

As an example, one vaccine3 is formulated from a crude mix of affinity purified E. maxima gametocyte antigens [128], although the levels of protection achieved have remained controversial and production of the vaccine still requires parasite amplification in chickens. Numerous studies have suggested that defined antigens such as apical membrane antigen 1, immune mapped protein 1, lactate dehydrogenase and SO7 are highly promising vaccine candidates (reviewed elsewhere [129]). Studies of Eimeria field populations have reported limited diversity in many of these antigens, indicating that recombinant vaccines for Eimeria may succeed even though antigenic diversity has undermined equivalent vaccines for related parasites such as Plasmodium [130, 131].

Most recently, it has been suggested that Eimeria itself might function as an expression/delivery vector for vaccine antigens [132\u2013134]. The ability to express and deliver anticoccidial vaccine antigens from multiple parasite species in a single transgenic line could provide an opportunity to streamline anticoccidial vaccine production from as many as eight lines to just one or two. Using an attenuated vector species such as E. acervulina can improve productive capacity enormously and reduce vaccine cost. The parasite vector may also provide some ability as an adjuvant and methods for on-farm delivery are well established [133].",

This trend is primarily driven by demands to produce \u201cno antibiotics ever\u201d poultry products. However, it has also been shown that some coccidial vaccines provide an opportunity to replace drug-resistant field parasites in a poultry house with susceptible vaccine strains. While current European attenuated vaccines are limited by their lower reproductive potential, live vaccines do retain considerable unexplored potential. A better understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms through which these nontraditional approaches operate is needed to allow further progress. Ultimately, it is clear that novel vaccines must be cost-effective, compatible with high standards of animal welfare, scalable and easy to deliver.",

The selection of adequate clinical isolates and vaccine formulations requires considerable expertise and the effective use of AVs depends on adequate manufacturing and appropriate veterinary oversight. Regulatory differences among countries create a highly fragmented legal landscape that would benefit from further harmonization.",

Therefore, they are promising alternatives that can reduce the need to use antibiotics in food-producing animals and their direct mitigating impact on antibiotic consumption has been demonstrated in a number of studies, even though the relationship between antibiotic use and vaccination is not in all cases clear-cut. The ideal vaccine is safe, effective against a broad range of pathogens, and easily adapted to mass-application. At the same time, it is cheap to produce and use, easy to register across key jurisdictions, and generates durable protection, ideally after a single administration.",
