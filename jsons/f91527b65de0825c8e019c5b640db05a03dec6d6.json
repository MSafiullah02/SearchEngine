Previous studies have demonstrated that lung lesions developed within 2-4 weeks in SIVinfected rhesus monkeys. By 8 weeks, essentially all monkeys developed lung pathology, including perivascular inflammation, vasculitis, interstitial pneumonia and syncytial cells. 7 Since our treatment was initiated at 8 weeks after infection, our data demonstrate that CD24Fc has a therapeutic effect on SIV-induced lung inflammatory lesions. CD24Fc is an agonist of Siglecs and can fortify the CD24-Siglec innate immune checkpoint. In particular, we have shown that the CD24-Siglec pathway can protect against destructive inflammation triggered by cell death. 1 Since the death of pneumocytes is a prominent feature of COVID-19, and ARDS is a major cause of mortality due to COVID-19, 8 it would be of interest to test CD24Fc as a COVID-19 therapy.",
