The alphaviruses are arthropod-borne (arboviruses), whereas the rubiviruses are transmitted via the respiratory tract. All arthropod-borne alphaviruses are antigenically related but most can be distinguished in cross-reactivity tests (Chanas et al., 1976, Clarke and Casals, 1958, Karabatsos, 1975, Porterfield, 1961) with which they have been divided into 8 antigenic complexes: Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Trocara (complex assigned based only on genetic divergence), Middelburg, Ndumu, Semliki Forest and Barmah Forest. In addition, there are two non-arthropod-borne species, Salmon pancreatic disease virus and Southern elephant seal virus. Based on comparative sequence analysis, the arthropod-borne alphaviruses share a minimum of about 40% amino acid identity in the more divergent structural proteins and 60% in the non-structural proteins.",

            "text": "Alphavirus virions are approximately 70 nm in diameter. They are spherical with a lipid bilayer containing heterodimeric protein spikes composed of two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Many alphaviruses also contain a third envelope protein E3. The heterodimers are organized in a T = 4 icosahedral lattice consisting of 80 trimers of E1\u2013E2 complex. The enclosed nucleocapsid core consists of 240 copies of capsid protein and a single copy of the genomic RNA, although Aura virus is reported also to enclose the 26S subgenomic RNA (Rumenapf et al., 1995). The one-to-one relationship between glycoprotein heterodimers and nucleocapsid proteins is important in virus assembly. E1 is the fusion protein for virus entry into the acidic cytoplasmic endosomes. The structure of the E1 glycoprotein of Semliki Forest virus has been determined by crystallography (Lescar et al., 2001), revealing a fold closely related to the flavivirus envelope protein. The E2 glycoprotein extends outwards from the envelope and forms the petals of the spike that cover the underlying E1 protein fusion peptide at neutral pH (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The four non-structural proteins are defined as nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4. The genomic RNA is positive-stranded and serves as the mRNA for translation of the polyprotein precursor that is autocatalytically processed to the four non-structural viral proteins by the virus-encoded protease in nsP2 (Fig. 1\n). The non-structural proteins form the transcription/replication complex that mediates the synthesis of diverse viral RNAs of both polarities. The nsP1 protein was implicated in capping of viral RNAs (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995, Scheidel et al., 1989) and in initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1994). It is bound to the cytoplasmic membrane via a central amphipathic alpha helix located in the middle of the protein (Lampio et al., 2000). The nsP2 gene encodes a putative helicase domain at the 5\u2032end and a protease domain at the 3\u2032end, which presents a unique fold distantly related to that of known cysteine proteases (Russo et al., 2006). This protease domain is linked to the downstream domain of the O\u2032-methyltransferase fold, that may be enzymatically active only in non-arthropod-borne alphaviruses (Feder et al., 2003). In its free form, the nsP2 protein induces cytotoxicity and is responsible for transcriptional shut-off, which is dependent on the integrity of the carboxy-terminal peptide located downstream of its helicase and protease domains. The nsP3 protein is required for RNA replication. It carries three domains: the N-terminal sequence reveals a macro domain, the crystal structures of which have recently been determined for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (Malet et al., 2009). It is followed by a serine/threonine-rich sequence that may be phosphorylated. The C-terminal region is poorly conserved in both size and sequence (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). The nsP4 protein carries the viral RNA polymerase motif (Kamer and Argos, 1984). During RNA replication, a negative-stranded copy is produced and used as a template for the synthesis of genome-sized positive-strand RNA and subgenomic 26S mRNA corresponding to the 3\u2032 third of the viral genome and encoding the viral structural proteins (Garmashova et al., 2006, Hahn et al., 1988, Lemm et al., 1994, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006, Weaver, 2005).",

VEEV is one species in the VEE antigenic complex, which is divided into six distinct antigenic subtypes (Walton and Grayson, 1988, Young, 1972, Young and Johnson, 1969). Subtypes IAB and IC are associated with major epidemics and equine epizootics during which equine mortality due to encephalitis can reach 83%. In 1995, a major outbreak in Venezuela and Colombia, was associated with the VEEV subtype IC. This epidemic resulted in roughly 100,000 human cases, with more than 300 fatal encephalitis cases (Diaz et al., 1997). Other epidemics indicate that VEEV still represents a serious public health problem (Weaver et al., 1996). In humans, whilst the overall mortality rate is low (<1%), neurological disease, including disorientation, ataxia, mental depression, and convulsions, can be detected in up to 14% of infected individuals, especially children (Johnson and Martin, 1974). Neurological sequelae in humans are also common (Leon, 1975). However, most human infections present as a non-specific febrile illness or aseptic meningitis. In rare cases, the fever and headache may progress through nausea and vomiting to somnolence or delirium and coma with seizures, impaired sensorium, and paralysis being commonly observed. The severity of neurologic involvement and sequelae is greater with decreasing age.",

In the case of MAYV the supposition of transoceanic introductions is also supported by the evidence that this New World virus causes arthritic disease in humans, as is characteristic of the Old World alphaviruses, rather than encephalitic disease as typified by New World viruses such as EEEV and VEEV (Poidinger et al., 1997, Russell, 1998). Weaver et al. (1997) proposed that these alphavirus dispersal patterns could be most readily explained if the origin of these viruses was the New World. However, in order to support this argument, it was necessary to propose that several transoceanic crossings (i.e. at least three) must have taken place, in both directions, i.e. westwards and eastwards (Powers et al., 2001). Moreover, it was estimated that recombination, as seen in WEEV and closely related descendant viruses, is likely to have occurred between 1300 and 1900 years ago (Weaver et al., 1997).",

On the other hand, during the past 500\u2013600 years, transoceanic crossings by ships for commercial and/or immigration and slave-trading purposes have been the major factor for the introduction into the Americas of many different Old World mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti, the Culex pipiens complex, Aedes albopictus (Calder and Laird, 1994) and African arboviruses including Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Powassan virus (reviewed in Bloom, 1993, de Lamballerie et al., 2008b, Gould et al., 2003, Lounibos, 2002, Strode, 1951, Tabachnick, 1991, Tatem et al., 2006). Whilst in the modern era, introductions do occur in the reverse direction (New World to Old World), they are usually importations of recognised arboviruses by viraemic individuals returning to their country of origin, following a business or leisure trip in the Americas. In temperate regions of the Old World, these individual introductions from the New World rarely, if ever, result in the establishment of endemic/epidemic arboviruses. There is a detailed record of YFV being introduced into South Wales (United Kingdom) from Cuba; the virus caused a small localised outbreak of yellow fever, but rapidly disappeared from circulation (Smith and Gibson, 1986) presumably, because the habitat lacked a suitable vector for YFV to become established.",

In Africa, a wide range of alphaviruses such as SFV, SINV, CHIKV, ONNV and others circulate in geographically overlapping environments, where they have relatively similar ecological requirements. Thus, the possibility of ancestral alphaviruses in Africa causing mixed infections of vertebrates and recombining to produce an ancestral lineage of a virus such as WEEV, is at least plausible. Secondly, during the centuries of intensive commercial trading between Africa and the Americas, some or many of these alphaviruses could have been carried to the Americas, in the way that many flaviviruses and mosquitoes were transported to the New World (Bloom, 1993, Bryant et al., 2007, Gould et al., 2003, Gould et al., 2001, Lounibos, 2002, Tabachnick, 1991). Under this scenario, transoceanic alphavirus dispersal would not need to occur in both directions. Moreover, the extremely low probability of a mixed infection occurring between an enzootic New World virus and an Old World virus, introduced to the Americas more than 1000 years ago, no longer needs to be explained. In addition, the geographically wide distribution of the alphaviruses in natural cycles in the Old World is entirely consistent with Old World anthropological distribution and commerce, and bird migratory patterns. Clearly, more alphaviruses need to be isolated and studied in detail to fill the gaps in our knowledge and to resolve the question of how these viruses have evolved and dispersed during the past few millennia. However, the ideas related above, appear to favour an Old World origin for the alphaviruses that are currently circulating.",

For example, in equatorial South and Central America, VEEV exists in two epidemiological forms: (i) enzootic viruses that are transmitted continuously in sylvatic habitats between mosquitoes and rodent reservoir hosts and (ii) epidemic/epizootic viruses (Weaver and Barrett, 2004, Weaver et al., 2004), that emerge periodically to cause outbreaks involving large numbers of humans and horses (Weaver et al., 1996). A Mexican equine epizootic, involving a proven epizootic vector Ochlerotatus (formerly Aedes) taeniorhynchus, serves as an excellent example. When compared with closely related enzootic strains, VEEV isolates from infected horses exhibited significantly greater infectivity for the vector that was associated with horses, suggesting that adaptation to the appropriate vector contributed to disease emergence. It was subsequently demonstrated that a Ser-Asn substitution in the E2 gene was the sole determinant of the increased vector infectivity (Brault et al., 2004). Similar patterns of enzootic and epizootic behaviour have also been observed with EEEV and WEEV although these viruses are not known to show increased patterns of virulence during these outbreaks.",

Prior to 2005, these alphaviruses were considered to be of relatively minor importance by most government health departments, largely because they were associated with localised outbreaks involving relatively few individuals and in general they were considered to be insignificant agents of encephalitic disease or fatal infections. Moreover, clinical misdiagnosis of many of these alphavirus infections in the dengue-endemic locations where they circulate is probably another reason that they have been underappreciated as causes of febrile illness. However, this attitude changed, from 2005, onwards when CHIKV unexpectedly arose as a major epidemic human pathogenic arbovirosis throughout, central and southern Africa, the Islands of the southern Indian Ocean, India, Indonesia and Malaysia. As the result of these spreading epidemics, CHIKV is now frequently being introduced into other regions of Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas by travellers returning from CHIKV epidemic areas of Asia. Indeed in Northern Italy the introduced virus became established in A. albopictus and caused localised outbreaks of chikungunya fever (Rezza et al., 2007). Although case fatality rates resulting from CHIKV infection are considered to be low, the very large numbers of clinical cases in Asia (now unofficially estimated to be millions) have almost certainly resulted in significantly more mortality than is currently recognised, particularly in countries where health services and recording procedures are poorly developed. Moreover, it has now become apparent that thousands of excess deaths, with many involving neurological disease, have accompanied recent CHIKV outbreaks (Josseran et al., 2006, Mavalankar et al., 2008, Robin et al., 2008). Additionally, recent studies on children in India, reported that at least 14% of CHIKV infections may result in neurological complications (Lewthwaite et al., 2009).",

Human outbreaks were associated with domestic mosquito species such as A. aegypti and it has always been assumed that the virus is transmitted down the chain of sylvatic/domestic mosquito species via humans and simians that come into contact with the virus at the edges of the jungles and in the nearby local villages/towns (Gould and Higgs, 2009). CHIKV was also known to cause spasmodic outbreaks in many parts of Asia, although a forest reservoir cycle has never been identified in Asia (Powers and Logue, 2007). However, as indicated above, this spasmodic pattern of outbreaks changed dramatically from 2005 onwards, when a major CHIKV fever epidemic was first identified on La R\u00e9union Island in the southern Indian Ocean (Charrel et al., 2007, de Lamballerie et al., 2008b, Schuffenecker et al., 2006).

These conclusions were derived from a combination of genomic, phylogenetic, and vector transmission studies, from which it was conclusively demonstrated that the adaptation of CHIKV to high vector competence in A. albopictus resulted directly from the substitution of the amino acid alanine by valine at position 226 (A226V) in the envelope gene (E1) of the virus (Schuffenecker et al., 2006, Tsetsarkin et al., 2007). Even more surprisingly, based on phylogenetic evidence and local knowledge of CHIKV epidemiology, it is clear that this selective adaptation for the tiger mosquito has occurred on several independent occasions (de Lamballerie et al., 2008b).",

A. albopictus is now established in virtually all tropical, sub-tropical and southern temperate regions (Lounibos, 2002). Moreover, local species of A. albopictus in Florida, USA, have now been shown to be susceptible to infection by CHIKV and competent to transmit this virus (Reiskind et al., 2008). Thus, it is almost certainly only a matter of time before CHIKV invades the Americas, being introduced by infected humans returning from endemic areas of Africa or Asia, possibly causing greater problems in the tropical regions due to the behavioural advantages of A. aegypti. Clearly, there is a pressing need for effective antivirals and vaccines with which to develop CHIKV disease control strategies.",

This finding was extended in studies in which in vitro methyltransferase activity of the SINV nsP1 (Mi and Stollar, 1991) and the SFV nsP1 (Laakkonen et al., 1994) was demonstrated. The active site residues of MT were identified by comparative sequence analysis which demonstrated that this enzyme is conserved in many virus families forming an alpha-like supergroup (Rozanov et al., 1992). The substrate of the reaction is GTP, which becomes methylated at its N7 position (me7GTP). The product me7GTP is then covalently bound to nsP1 to generate a covalent me7GMP-nsP1 adduct and inorganic pyrophosphate (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995). However, guanylyltransfer of the me7GMP onto RNA remains to be demonstrated. nsP1 activity is dependent on membrane association (Ahola et al., 1999). This interaction is mediated by an amphipathic helix located in the middle of the nsP1 sequence (Spuul et al., 2007). This helix contains hydrophobic amino acids that can interact with acyl groups of the membrane and a cluster of positively charged residues that contact the phospholipid polar heads (Lampio et al., 2000). It remains unclear if palmitoylation of several cysteines contributes to membrane binding (Ahola et al., 2000), but this post-translational modification plays a role in the cellular localization of the replication complex (Laakkonen et al., 1996).",

Using in vitro tests, the nsP2 gene of SFV exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase activity utilizing GTP and ATP (Rikkonen et al., 1994) and stimulated by RNA. This activity is stimulated in the presence of RNA. nsP2 could thus act at least at two stages in the infected cell. Firstly, as with the NS3 protein of flaviviruses, the nsP2 nucleotide triphosphatase may produce 5\u2032 diphosphate mRNA, the expected final acceptor of the nsP1-mediated guanylyltransferase reaction catalysed by nsP1 (Vasiljeva et al., 2000). Secondly, the nsP2 ATPase activity is believed to be necessary to fuel RNA helicase activity. The dsRNA unwinding is magnesium-dependent in SFV (Gomez de Cedr\u00f3n et al., 1999). The C-terminal region of nsP2 is a cysteine protease which is responsible for viral polyprotein processing (Strauss et al., 1992, Vasiljeva et al., 2001).",

A positively charged amino acid patch also enables the binding of oligonucleotides such as poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) or RNA, but the common determinant of substrate binding is a conserved adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate binding site. It has now been shown that mutation of amino acids 10 and 24 from asparagine to alanine in the ADP-ribose binding region of the SINV macro domain impairs replication and viral RNA synthesis particularly in mouse neurones without any alteration in poly(ADP-ribose) binding (Park and Griffin, 2009). Moreover, mutation at position 10 had the greatest effect and caused nsP3 instability in neurones, decreased SINV-induced death of mature, but not immature neurones, and attenuated virulence in 2 weeks old, but not 5-day-old mice. Thus, the nsP3 macro domain appears to be significantly involved in both SINV replication and age-dependent susceptibility to encephalomyelitis. As a part of the structural genomics section in VIZIER, we have also determined the crystal structure of the EEEV macro domain. The level of amino acid conservation of the entire nsP3 when compared with VEEV and EEEV is 43% identity. However, the structural model for EEEV is still under refinement, and was therefore not included in our most recent publication (Malet et al., 2009). Sequence analysis of the C-terminal region of the nsP3 protein does not suggest any putative enzymatic activity. This region encodes a cluster of up to 16 serines and threonines that can be phosphorylated (LaStarza et al., 1994, Li et al., 1990) although it is not catalysed by nsP3 (Vihinen et al., 2001). Its decreased phosphorylation in SINV produces less minus strand RNA compared to wild type (D\u00e9 et al., 2003). Moreover, variants of SFV that are poorly phosphorylated or have deletions in this hypervariable domain exhibit a low viral pathogenicity profile in mice and show reduced viral RNA synthesis in cell culture (Galbraith et al., 2005, Vihinen et al., 2001). The absence of the nsP3 C-terminus also alters SFV neurovirulence (Tuittila et al., 2000). The C-terminal region of nsP3 has specific sequence features of natively unfolded proteins, suggesting that this domain is involved in transcription regulation as proposed previously (Wang et al., 1994).",

It is believed that this protein synthesizes both negative- and positive-strand RNAs. In SINV, the switch between the production of antisense RNA to genomic and subgenomic RNA is mediated by processing of the nsP123 region of the polyprotein (Lemm et al., 1998, Lemm et al., 1994, Shirako and Strauss, 1994). In vitro, this activity has been reported to be sequence-specific (Lemm et al., 1998). A peptide sequence containing two key arginines is involved in promoter sequence recognition to initiate the synthesis of subgenomic RNA (Li et al., 2004). The N-terminal region of nsP4 is poorly conserved and natively unfolded. It could be involved in the recruitment of RNA or protein partners. Alone, nsP4 does not replicate RNA. An N-terminally truncated version of SINV nsP4 carries out terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity that might be involved in maintenance of the 3\u2032 poly A tail (Tomar et al., 2006). Very recently, RdRp activity was demonstrated in vitro using a purified full-length SINV nsP4 protein (Rubak et al., 2009).",

Recent research on the efficacy of Chloroquine has focused on the dosage used to treat acute CHIKV infections (de Lamballerie et al., 2008a, Savarino et al., 2007). Chloroquine phosphate has also been used to treat chronic chikungunya arthritis (Brighton, 1984) by utilising the anti-inflammatory properties of the molecule, rather than possible antiviral effects. Based on experiments in cell culture, results comparable with those obtained using CHIKV, were also observed with the SARS coronavirus. Chloroquine was therefore proposed as a potential antiviral molecule for the treatment of humans infected with the SARS coronavirus (Keyaerts et al., 2004, Leyssen et al., 2006).",

No statistical difference was observed between the Chloroquine and placebo groups, either in mean duration of febrile arthralgia or rate of decrease of viraemia (between day 1 and day 3). At day 200 post-infection Chloroquine-treated patients declared more frequently (p\n < 0.01) that they still suffered from arthralgia than patients who had received the placebo. However, the number of patients included in the study was too small to draw definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of the Chloroquine treatment. Recent experiments in macaques (Macaca fascicularis) also failed to identify a detectable antiviral effect of Chloroquine following experimental infections and similar doses of Chloroquine (Le Grand et al., manuscript in preparation).

Also, in contrast with Chloroquine, resistant mutants were obtained by growing CHIKV in increasing concentrations of Quinine. The mutations were detected in the nsP1 protein, suggesting impairment of function of the viral guanylyltransferase enzyme [XdeL; personal observation]. This region of nsP1 has also been indirectly related to methyltransferase activity in SINV isolates (Laakkonen et al., 1994, Mi et al., 1989, Mi and Stollar, 1991, Wang et al., 1996) which has been shown to be an essential component of SINV pathogenicity in mice (Zhu et al., 2009).

In some cases it inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, depleting cellular GTP pools. In others it is used as a non-canonical substrate for RNA synthesis introducing numerous mutations whose accumulation may lead to virus inactivation due to error catastrophe (Crotty et al., 2001, Severson et al., 2003). In the case of some arenaviruses ribavirin 5\u2032-tri-phosphate interacts with the viral polymerase (Sun et al., 2007). It was also tested as an aerosol for the treatment of paediatric Respiratory Syncytial Virus infections but was not approved and this method has now been discontinued. Ribavirin is used in combination with alpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection but the mechanism of action is multifactorial. The predominant direct mechanism by which ribavirin exerts its antiviral activity in vitro against flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses is mediated by inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase (Leyssen et al., 2005), because viral RNA synthesis requires a high GTP concentration, and also because resistance mutations can be isolated that map on the NS5b polymerase (Young et al., 2003). An indirect mechanism via decreasing the GTP pools may also be important (Zhou et al., 2003).",

However, for clinical application it is expensive and requires parenteral injection, making it unsuitable for large-scale use during epidemics. Human infection with CHIKV appears to induce immunological dysfunction. However, interferon usually boosts the immune response. Therefore caution in its usage is recommended until more extensive non-human primate models have been studied. Pegylated alpha interferon appears to be an effective treatment against infection with VEEV and has profound effects on the host immune response to infection (Lukaszewski and Brooks, 2000). Thus, it might be justified to test pegylated alpha interferon on CHIKV and other pathogenic alphaviruses.",

Carbodine was shown to inhibit cellular cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthetase, which converts UTP to CTP, resulting in indirect inhibition of virus replication through reduction of CTP pools (de Clercq et al., 1990). In cell culture, carbodine is a broad-spectrum antiviral, with activity against several unrelated viruses (Andrei and De Clercq, 1990, Neyts et al., 1996) although cytotoxicity has been demonstrated. The addition of exogenous cytidine (cyd) or uridine results in reversal of antiviral activity of carbodine in various cell lines (Andrei and De Clercq, 1990). The natural nucleosides are dextrorotatory (d), but both d- and laevorotatory (l)-analogues can inhibit metabolic enzymes (Gumina et al., 2002) and the d-enantiomer may show reduced cytotoxicity. Accordingly, the d-enantiomer was recently used to test the inhibitory qualities of carbodine against VEEV-challenged mice (Julandera et al., 2008). Increased survival rates, increased average time to death and reduced brain virus titres were observed when carbodine treatment was followed by challenge of the mice with the attenuated vaccine strain (TC83) of VEEV. Evidence of inhibitory effects was also detected if the carbodine was administered up to 4 days post-infection.",

The helicase region of SFV nsP2 can be expressed in E. coli but the protein is unstable after purification, requiring a high salt concentration (Gomez de Cedr\u00f3n et al., 1999). Nevertheless, the protein is active and production yields could be compatible with existing helicase HTP assays using non-radioactive readouts (Boguszewska-Chachulska et al., 2004, Tani et al., 2009). Currently, the protease domain of nsP2 is the most promising target for rational inhibitor screening. This protease is responsible for non-structural polyprotein processing, an essential function for virus replication (Balistreri et al., 2007, de Groot et al., 1990, Mayuri et al., 2008). Inhibitors can be selected through a structure-based method, using the VEEV protease structural data as a template (Russo et al., 2006). This strategy could be combined with enzymatic assays already described for several alphavirus proteases (Zhang et al., 2009). Interestingly, leupeptin, a broad-spectrum cysteine protease inhibitor, has no effect on the protease activity of CHIKV nsP2 (Pastorino et al., 2008), suggesting that this protease has structural and functional specificities that could be specifically targeted.",

However, as discussed earlier, this situation began to change from 2005 onwards, following the surprisingly large-scale outbreaks of chikungunya fever on many of the inhabited islands of the southern Indian Ocean. Consequently, the recent first demonstration that alphavirus RdRp activity is encoded in the nsP4 gene (Rubak et al., 2009) provides a strong incentive for vigorous studies to identify effective inhibitors of alphavirus RdRps. In alphaviruses, assembly of the multi-subunit replication complex is required for demonstration of RdRp activity. Thus, in vitro assays require at least nsP123 and nsP4 in the reaction mixture, and the assays are only effective if recombinant nsP4 is expressed with the N-terminal tyrosine (Rubak et al., 2009, Shirako et al., 2003). Whilst experimental conditions for the generation of authentic nsP4 have been defined, recombinant nsP123 is still expressed exclusively in mammalian cells (Rubak et al., 2009), which could prove to be a limitation in the context of HT inhibitor screening. Clearly many problems remain to be resolved.",

A live-attenutated vaccine against VEEV was first developed in 1961 (Berge et al., 1961) and has been administered to more than 8000 individuals (Alevizatos et al., 1967, Burke et al., 1977, Pittman et al., 1996). As the result of adverse effects in a significant proportion of these vaccinated individuals, an inactivated vaccine was developed (Pittman et al., 1996) and a more promising highly attenuated vaccine (V3526) based on an infectious cDNA clone of VEEV was also developed (Davis et al., 1995, Hart et al., 2000) but concerns over the possibility of reversion to virulence have not been totally alleviated. Hence, alternative approaches such as the development of chimaeric viruses with the replicative machinery from SINV, and the structural genes from VEEV are still being pursued (Berge et al., 1961, Paessler et al., 2006). The first attempts to develop inactivated vaccines against CHIKV were reported in 1970 (Eckels et al., 1970). However, these early immunogens have not been developed as licensed vaccines.",

One method involves the preparation of purified inactivated virus using methods similar to those that have proved successful for the development of an inactivated vaccine against Tick-borne encephalitis virus (Pavlova et al., 2003). A second method involves the use of cDNA fragments representing the important immunogenic regions of the CHIKV genome (Muthumani et al., 2008).

However, in 2005, the relative level of importance of alphaviruses as a significant public health problem was raised when CHIKV unexpectedly emerged as a major human pathogen in Africa, the Indian Ocean, India and Malaysia. The continuing epidemic of chikungunya fever, which has now lasted for 4 years and shows little sign of abating, has the potential to reach the Americas, where if past history of other invading RNA viruses is predictive, could lead to high levels of human morbidity. Faced with this prospect and the possibility that as the result of human impact on habitat and global/local distribution of vectors and hosts, other alphaviruses such as ONNV might also emerge to produce much more extensive epidemics than they have done in the past, the search for antivirals to combat these viruses clearly needs to be intensified.",
