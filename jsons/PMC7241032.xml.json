We already understand that the gut microbiota\nare responsible for the health of individuals starting from birth\nand during early life, adulthood, and aging. MMF is used as a digestive\nagent where it functions in strengthening the gut and spleen and in\nbalancing the digestive system. In addition, Massa Medicata Fermentata\nis used for gastroenteritis and dyspepsia with low gastric acidity.5 MMF is a fermented drug that has been widely\nused since the beginning of the third century. MMF is used as a digestive\nagent clinically, and it has the functions of strengthening the spleen\nand gut and balancing the digestion system.6 MMF is used for dyspepsia and gastroenteritis with low gastric acidity.\nMMF is a traditional Chinese medicine with natural fermentation, and\nMMF is made by Artemisia annua, Polygonum\nhydropiper, Xanthium sibiricum, red bean,\nbitter almond, flour, and wheat bran7 (National\nPharmacopoeia Commission. Pharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (3 Part) [S], 2012). Modern studies have shown that the fermented\nMMF can improve the disorder of the bacterial system in the gut, and\nthe unfermented MMF does not have these pharmacological activities.\nAccording to \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China Pharmacopoeia\n2010\u201d, in a set prescription of fermented herbal medicine,\nMMF can account for up to 47%. Although MMF has been used for a long\ntime by the Chinese and there is also a huge domestic market today,\nthere are few studies about the fermentation and metabolic processes,\nand its medicinal ingredients have not been determined. This is resulting\nin poor controllability of the production and the market.8 To ensure the safety and effectiveness of MMF\nfor clinical use, we have to study the MMF fermented process and finally\nto explore the active medicinal ingredients of MMF.",
