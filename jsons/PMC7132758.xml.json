Conventional infection control methods (such as hand hygiene and patient isolation and/or cohorting) are recommended, but adoption of rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tools is mandatory for the management and antiviral treatment of these severe clinical conditions.",

Moreover, admission frequency for severe acute lower respiratory syndrome is more than 3 times higher in neonates with respect to older children (Nair et al., 2013). Detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR has been described as an important tool for the accurate identification of pathogens causing respiratory syndromes (Mahony, 2008, Caliendo, 2011). Recently, the FilmArray RP assay was compared with different commercial molecular assays in pediatric and non-pediatric patients and showed good concordance of results (Babady et al., 2012, Hayden et al., 2012, Pierce et al., 2012, Rand et al., 2011). In this study, we carried out a retrospective analysis to evaluate FilmArray RP performance in neonates admitted to neonatal care units.",

Agreement was the same within samples with a single virus as well as those with multiple viruses. Only a few samples showed discordant results. However, the FilmArray RP assay identified additional viruses such as HRV/HEV and bocavirus, which were missed by both laboratory-developed real-time PCR and Seegene Seeplex RV15\u00ae as also reported by Pierce et al. (2012). In our series, this finding is likely due to 2 different biases related to the methods used to test the samples. In detail, the FilmArray RP assay simultaneously detects HRV and HEV, while the laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR is specific for HRV. Hence, the FilmArray RP\u2013positive samples could contain HEV besides HRV. hBoV was not included in the laboratory-developed real-time PCR panel. The decreased performance for hAdV detection reported by others (Pierce et al., 2012) was not fully evidenced in our series due to the limited number of hAdV positive samples. Finally, 2 major disadvantages were highlighted: i) the single-sample run that restricts the use of FilmArray to numerically limited routines and ii) the qualitative results obtained. On the other hand, the advantages of the FilmArray RP are the rapid detection of respiratory viruses with a turnaround time of 1 hour for each specimen, the wide number of pathogens detected in a single assay, and the reduced hands-on time. In addition, the FilmArray assay also includes hBoV and 3 bacteria (B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) not included in other respiratory detection panels.",
