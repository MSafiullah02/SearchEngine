The past decade has seen a drastic reduction in malaria cases and deaths worldwide, but this stunning progress has now been halted by widespread emergence of drug resistance in both parasite and vector species. Whereas Plasmodium falciparum dominates in sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium vivax is responsible for most cases in many regions of Asia. At least four additional species can infect humans: Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri. Many other species of Plasmodium have been reported to cause malaria in vertebrates, including non-human primates (for example, Plasmodium cynomolgi in macaques and Plasmodium reichenowi in chimpanzees), rodents (for example, Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium yoelli), birds (for example, Plasmodium gallinaceum, Plasmodium relictum and Plasmodium elongatum) and reptiles (for example, Plasmodium mexicanum).",

They grow and develop in a wide range of host environments, both within blood-feeding mosquitoes, their definitive hosts, and in vertebrates, which are intermediate hosts. This diversity is testament to their exceptional adaptability and poses a major challenge for developing effective strategies to reduce the disease burden and transmission. Following one asexual amplification cycle in the liver, parasites reach high burdens by rounds of asexual replication within red blood cells. A few of these blood-stage parasites make a developmental switch into the sexual stage (or gametocyte), which is essential for transmission. The bone marrow, in particular the haematopoietic niche (in rodents, also the spleen), is a major site of parasite growth and sexual development. This Review focuses on our current understanding of blood-stage parasite development and vascular and tissue sequestration, which is responsible for disease symptoms and complications, and when involving the bone marrow, provides a niche for asexual replication and gametocyte development. Understanding these processes provides an opportunity for novel therapies and interventions.",

            "text": "The features of the malaria parasite life cycle are largely conserved across Plasmodium lineages that infect mammals (Fig. 1) . When an infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a vertebrate, it also injects sporozoites into the skin. The motile sporozoite enters the bloodstream, which enables it to reach the liver and thereby escape host immunity or drainage through the lymphatic system 2,3 . Once sporozoites have reached the liver sinusoids, they cross the sinusoidal barrier and enter into hepatocytes 2 , in which they establish a parasitophorous vacuole and differentiate in a first round of asexual replication 4 . Over the course of 2 days to several days (dependent on species), a multinucleated exo-erythrocytic schizont (or meront) containing thousands of daughter merozoites forms. Some parasite species, such as P. vivax and P. ovale, can then enter a period of latency by forming a non-replicating hypnozoite instead of a schizont. These hypnozoites enable long-term survival of the parasite and can lead to relapses. Upon egress from the hepatocyte, merozoites are clustered in membrane-bound vesicles called merosomes and released back into injected into the skin during the blood meal of an infected mosquito. They will migrate to and enter a blood capillary. b | Through the bloodstream, the sporozoites reach the liver sinusoids and there they leave the blood circulation to invade a hepatocyte, after multiple transmigration events. In the hepatocyte, they undergo one asexual replication cycle that results in a liver schizont containing thousands of merozoites (yellow). The merozoites enter the bloodstream in membranebound structures termed merosomes. Once released, merozoites infect red blood cells (red) to initiate the intra-erythrocytic parasite cycle. c | In the blood, P. falciparum parasites undergo cycles of asexual replication (blue). After invasion of a red blood cell, they develop from ring stages to trophozoites and then to schizonts. Mature schizonts burst to release merozoites that initiate another replication cycle. A subpopulation of parasites commits to produce male and female sexual progeny or gametocytes (green). d | A female Anopheles mosquito picks up gametocytes while feeding on an infected human. Male and female gametocytes undergo gametogenesis within the midgut of the mosquito. The gametes then fertilize to form a zygote (orange), which further develops into motile ookinetes. Ookinetes cross the midgut epithelium to form an oocyst beneath the basal lamina. In the oocyst, thousands of sporozoites form, which upon bursting of the oocyst wall enter the haemolymph to invade the salivary gland. From there, sporozoites are transmitted to the next human during the subsequent mosquito bite, closing the complex life cycle of the parasite.",

This asexual replication cycle produces up to 32 merozoites over the course of 24-72 h (both parameters vary between species). Through repeated rounds of invasion and growth, the parasite establishes acute and, eventually, chronic infections. Some species, such as P. vivax, are restricted to reticulocytes, which make up a small fraction of circulating RBCs, thereby limiting total parasitaemia. Others, such as P. falciparum, are not restricted and may infect a high proportion of RBCs leading to high parasite burden, a factor implicated in the capacity of P. falciparum to cause severe disease. The sexual cycle is initiated when a small proportion of asexual parasites commit to produce sexual progeny, that is, gametocytes. Mature gametocytes can circulate in the human blood for several days, which maximizes their chance of transmission to mosquitoes. A few minutes after entering the mosquito midgut, both male and female gametocytes use proteases to exit the RBCs and differentiate into eight microgametes and one macrogamete, respectively 6 , which fuse to produce the zygote. The zygote transforms into a motile ookinete, which crosses the epithelial layer of the midgut wall to form an oocyst. In the oocyst, parasites undergo the third cycle of asexual replication to produce thousands of sporozoites that are released into the haemolymph. Sporozoites that reach the salivary glands of the mosquito attach and invade the gland, where they remain until transmitted to a new vertebrate host through a mosquito bite, to start the cycle again.",

            "text": "Gametocytogenesis. The rate of commitment to sexual development varies widely between species and is determined by a combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Initial studies identified chromosomal deletions that lead to the loss of gametocytogenesis of P. falciparum during in vitro culture and of P. berghei in mice 7, 8 . A few years ago, genetic studies in P. falciparum and P. berghei 9,10 identified an essential transcriptional activator of sexual commitment, ap2-g. The ap2-g locus is epigenetically silenced in asexual parasites through the cooperative action of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) 11 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDA2) 12 . Recently, it was demonstrated that the perinuclear protein gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) 13 directly interacts with HP1 and derepresses the ap2-g locus 14 , leading to ap2-g transcription and sexual commitment in a subset of schizonts. In P. falciparum, the rate of sexual commitment is sensitive to environmental factors and can be altered depending on in vitro culture conditions [15] [16] [17] . Recent work revealed that physiological levels of the human serum phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) can repress sexual commitment in vitro 17, 18 . LysoPC thereby functions as an environmental signal for nutrient availability in the host as its metabolites are required for membrane biosynthesis and, hence, parasite replication. Whereas ap2-g is conserved across Plasmodium species, the gdv1 locus and the repressive activity of LysoPC are absent in the subgenus Vinckeia, a rodent malaria lineage of Plasmodium. Besides ap2-g, the earliest detectable transcriptional signature of sexual commitment is an increased expression of a subset of invasion markers [17] [18] [19] [20] . A second wave of induced genes encodes many proteins that are exported into the host RBC, the functions of which are discussed below. The process of sexual commitment has been summarized and discussed in detail elsewhere 21, 22 .",

At 9-12 days, P. falciparum has the longest (known) gametocyte development, which spans five morphologically distinct phases (stages I-V) 23 . All other studied species from the primate, rodent and avian lineages show subtle morphological changes during gametocyte development and a cycle time between 24 and 60 h (reF. 24 ). During gametocyte development in P. falciparum a continuous sheath of microtubules assembles. The microtubules are attached to an array of alveolar sacs beneath the plasma membrane of the parasite, which is called the inner membrane complex (IMC). An IMC can also be found in sporozoites and ookinetes, in which it is required for cellular motility and passage across the sinusoidal and epithelial barrier, respectively. In P. falciparum, the establishment of the IMC during early gametocyte development coincides with modifications of the cytoskeleton of the infected RBC (iRBC), including integration of exported parasite antigens, and results in a reversible stiffening of the iRBC [25] [26] [27] . Consequently, stage II-IV gametocytes are more rigid than stage V gametocytes. Interestingly, the characteristic features of the P. falciparum gametocytes (continuous IMC and alterations to RBC cytoskeleton and rigidity) are absent in asexual blood-stage parasites, suggesting fundamental differences in the biology between these two blood stages. It is unclear whether these features are limited to P. falciparum gametocytes (and closely related species of the subgenus Laverania) or whether they are more conserved across the Plasmodium lineage.",

Individual PfEMP1 variants have differential binding affinities to host receptors, and the organ-specific distribution or activation of these host receptors determines disease development. Binding of PfEMP1 to EPCR 28 and ICAM1 (reF. 36 ) is crucial for brain sequestration (and causal for cerebral malaria), whereas the interactions with CSA 37 and IgM 38 are required for sequestration in the placenta (and causal for placental malaria). PfEMP1 is the major target of host immunity on the iRBC 39 and is under strong selection to maximize its ability both to evade immunity and to bind host receptors. The role of other surface antigens, such as repetitive interspersed families of polypeptides (RIFIN) 40, 41 and subtelomeric variant open reading frame (STEVOR) 41, 42 , in cytoadherence of P. falciparum is less clear. However, both variant antigens have been implicated in rosetting, a sequestration mechanism in which iRBCs bind to uninfected RBCs to form clusters that obstruct the microvasculature 42, 43 . Parasite-induced modifications of the cyto skeleton and surface of iRBCs, in particular knob structures, increase the likelihood of clearance in the spleen owing to altered biophysical properties of the iRBC. Hence, cytoadherence of iRBCs actively prevents parasites from being in the circulation and, thereby, passing through the spleen. Plasmodium coatneyi is the only parasite in the primate malaria lineage that is known to induce knob-like structures and cyto adherence 44 . The parasite determinants are unknown, however, as both of the major knob components -knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) and the major surface ligand, PfEMP1 -are limited to P. falciparum and other members of the Laverania subgenus and, therefore, are absent from P. coatneyi. On the other hand, P. vivax increases the deformability of host cells during asexual blood-stage development to facilitate passage through the spleen, and there is no conclusive evidence for parasite accumulation in the brain or placenta and associated pathology in this species 45 .",

Several case studies identified P. falciparum and P. vivax gametocytes in the bone marrow and spleen [47] [48] [49] [50] , leading to the hypothesis that these organs may represent major sites of gametocyte sequestration. A series of recent studies finally provided quantitative data to confirm these earlier findings (Fig. 4) . A histological and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of asexual and immature gametocyte stages in samples from children who died from P. falciparum malaria in Malawi showed that the bone marrow is the only organ with substantial gametocyte enrichment, whereas most asexual parasites were found in the spleen, followed by the brain, heart, gut and bone marrow 51 . Analysis of blood samples and bone marrow aspirates from children with P. falciparum malaria and severe anaemia in Mozambique by smears and qRT-PCR showed substantial enrichment of immature gametocytes in the bone marrow compared with the blood 52 . The bone marrow is the major haemato poietic organ in adult mammals, birds and reptiles. It constitutes ~4% of the total body mass in humans, producing approximately 5 \u00d7 10 11 haematopoietic stem cells per day [53] [54] [55] (all white blood cells, RBCs and platelets). Erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow parenchyma, which is connected to the blood circulation through branched sinusoidal vessels. Terminal erythropoiesis occurs in specialized niches, which are called erythroblast islands and consist of a central macro phage surrounded by nucleated RBC precursors 56 . The final nucleated precursor stage is the orthochromatic erythroblast, and once it loses its nucleus, newly formed reticulocytes cross the sinusoidal endothelium to enter the blood circulation. Haematopoiesis outside the bone marrow can occur under both physiological and pathological conditions, in particular in the red pulp of the spleen and in the liver sinusoids. In contrast to humans and all other mammals, the red pulp of the spleen is the major haematopoietic organ in rodents.",

Only young (stage I) gametocytes were found in reticulocytes, suggesting that gametocytes can either form in cells of the erythroblastic island or home to bone marrow as merozoites or in reticulocytes 51 . This finding represented the first quantitative evidence of an extravascular reservoir of bloodstage Plasmodium spp. parasites. Histological analysis in splenectomized non-human primates infected with P. vivax confirmed the bone marrow as a primary site of gametocyte enrichment in Plasmodium spp. 57 . Again, most gametocytes were found outside the blood circulation in the bone marrow parenchyma, followed by the liver sinusoids. Moreover, a tissue screen of mice infected with P. berghei showed enrichment of immature gametocytes in the parenchyma and sinusoids of the spleen, bone marrow and liver 58 . Finally, P. falciparum infection in immune-deficient mice showed gametocyte accumulation in the bone marrow and spleen 59 . The apparent conservation of this trait across different hosts and three Plasmodium species that have varying gametocyte matu ration times (2 days in P. vivax and P. berghei versus 12 days in P. falciparum) and morphology (roundish in P. vivax and P. berghei versus elongated in P. falciparum) indicates that the sequestration of immature gametocytes in the bone marrow and secondary haematopoietic organs is a ubiquitous feature of Plasmodium spp. parasites (BOx 1).",

Moreover, the bone marrow parenchyma and liver sinusoids are the main P. vivax reservoir outside the blood circulation in splenectomized non-human primates 57 , whereas the spleen, bone marrow and liver are major reservoirs of asexual P. berghei parasites in mice 58, 60 . It was generally assumed that P. berghei and P. vivax parasites do not sequester; however, low levels of P. vivax trophozoites and schizonts compared with ring stages in the blood circulation 57,61,62 and the high frequency of severe anaemia despite low peripheral parasitaemia 63 have already challenged this assumption. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the haematopoietic niche of the bone marrow, and other haematopoietic organs, such as the spleen and liver (depending on host species), represent a major reservoir of blood-stage malaria parasites, including asexual stages. This finding is of particular relevance for parasites that prefer, or are restricted to, young RBCs found in the bone marrow, such as P. vivax and P. berghei. An extravascular reservoir of asexual parasites may sustain parasite replication and promote gametocyte formation. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of stage I P. falciparum gametocytes in bone marrow Coinciding with maturation of the erythroid cells from polychromatic to orthochromatic nucleated red blood cell precursors and then to reticulocytes, erythroblastic islands move closer to the sinusoids. When the reticulocytes have lost their cell nucleus, they are eventually released and enter (either through or between endothelial cells) into the sinusoidal lumen. The asexual parasite cycle in the bone marrow parenchyma is likely established both by influx of asexual merozoites (blue) or ring stages from the sinusoids and by a genuine asexual cycle in the bone marrow. In the parenchyma, asexual parasites may invade and develop in association with erythroblastic islands, or with other cell types. The exported gametocyte-exported parasite proteins (GEXP07 and GEXP10) on the surface of infected red blood cells interact with the host chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1), which is expressed on different host cells including bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), providing a potential mechanism by which parasites are retained in the bone marrow parenchyma. Gametocytes (green) mature in the bone marrow and are derived either from extravasated sexual merozoites or rings, or from extravascular schizonts that commit to produce sexual progeny in the bone marrow environment. Most gametocytes associate with erythroblastic islands. Stage I and II gametocytes express GEXP07 and GEXP10, which might contribute to bone marrow retention by interacting with other cell types, such as the nursing macrophages and BM-MSCs. Stages III and IV are retained in the bone marrow by their high rigidity, preventing passage through the endothelium. Ultimately, mature stage V gametocytes enter the sinusoids.

Notable discoveries based on these models include the identification of sexual stages 113 , exo-erythrocytic development 114, 115 and transmission by mosquitos 116 . avian malaria parasites were also used for early antimalaria drug screening 117 and in attempts for in vitro culture 118 . however, there are differences between malaria parasites infecting mammals and those infecting other vertebrates (see figure) . all avian and reptile haemosporidians, as well as bat parasites from the genus Polychromophilus, have primary and secondary exo-erythrocytic schizogony, often in diverse cell types 109, 110 . multiple secondary exo-erythrocytic replication cycles often produce a high tissue parasite burden. Some secondary exo-erythrocytic schizonts produce numerous merozoites, which develop into gametocytes that can reach high peripheral parasitaemia. avian and reptile Plasmodium spp. also show erythrocytic schizogony. merozoites from erythrocytic and exo-erythrocytic schizonts can initiate secondary exo-erythrocytic schizogony, forming phanerozoites, which often develop in endothelial cells lining the capillaries 110,119,120 . massive infestation of bone marrow cells by phanerozoites often occurs during infection of birds with Plasmodium elongatum and some other species 110, 111, 121 . In these infections, phanerozoites are found in haematopoietic tissues, in particular in haematopoietic stem cells. P. elongatum can cause dyserythropoiesis and anaemia due to damage of bone marrow cells 111, 122 . The ability of erythrocytic and exo-erythrocytic merozoites to initiate secondary exo-erythrocytic schizogony in avian and reptile parasites opens opportunities for experiments on the tissue stages by inoculation of infected blood, avoiding the use of vectors 119 . Blood schizogony is only reported for Plasmodium spp. of reptiles, birds and mammals 110, 112 , and in species of the Garniidae 123 . It is absent in the leucocytozoidae and haemoproteidae and in Polychromophilus and has not been reported in Nycteria and Hepatocystis. By contrast, gametocytes are always present in cells of the erythroid lineage, and they often reach high parasitaemia 108-110,123-125 . major transitions in life-history traits during haemosporidian evolution are: the emergence of erythrocytic schizogony in the Plasmodiidae species of birds and reptiles, resulting in a second source of gametocyte stages (see figure, part a) ; and subsequent loss of the secondary exoerythrocytic schizogony in Plasmodiidae species of mammals, resulting in erythrocytic schizogony as the only source of gametocytes (see figure, part b) . Despite the marked diversity in morphology and life cycles, haemosporidians share several features in their gametocyte development. First, the gametocyte is the only parasite stage found in cells of the erythroid lineage across all known haemosporidians. Second, gametocytes originate from merozoites developing in schizonts (in the haemoproteidae and leucocytozoidae families they form only in exoerythrocytic schizonts; in some members of the Plasmodiidae family (and probably the Garniidae family) they form only in erythrocytic schizonts; and in some members of the Plasmodiidae family (and probably the Garniidae family) they are formed through erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic schizogony 110, 112 ). Interestingly, gametocytes are sexually dimorphic in all known haemosporidians [108] [109] [110] 112 , in contrast to gametocytes in other apicomplexans.",

The conditions in the haematopoietic niche may be conducive for gametocyte commitment. Indeed, levels of the major physiological repressor of gametocyte commitment, the host phospholipid LysoPC, are much lower in the bone marrow than in the blood 17 . In addition, ~50% of all parasites in the bone marrow are gametocytes, both for P. falciparum and P. vivax, whereas they make up fewer than 5% of all parasites in the peripheral blood 51, 57 . Alternatively, gametocyte formation may be triggered in the vasculature, possibly through local LysoPC depletion at sites of parasite sequestration, systemically during inflammation 17 or simply in a stochastic manner. In such a scenario, young gametocyte forms must be detectable in the blood circu lation and able to home to the bone marrow before becoming too rigid and cleared by the spleen. Indeed, early gametocyte transcripts including ap2-g are present at detectable levels in patient blood both by qRT-PCR and microarray [64] [65] [66] [67] , enabling quantification of the rate of conversion to parasites committed to sexual development in vivo 64 . Importantly, experiments with P. berghei also provide indirect evidence of homing and extravasation of a subset of merozoites to the bone marrow parenchyma.",

Inhibition of either P-selectin or a combination of ICAM1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) reduced the number of young gametocytes (but not asexual parasites) in early reticulocytes in the bone marrow, suggesting an involvement of these receptors in merozoite extravasation to the bone marrow 58 . Interestingly, human P-selectin has been found in vitro to interact with members of the family of merozoite surface protein 7-related proteins (MSRPs) in P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. berghei 68 . Moreover, singlecell and bulk transcriptome analyses have consistently shown an upregulation of msrp1 and a second merozoite antigen, dblmsp2, in sexually committed P. falciparum schizonts [17] [18] [19] . It is therefore tempting to speculate that these two antigens are involved in extravasation and/or host cell invasion of sexual merozoites in the bone marrow. Interestingly, experiments in the rodent model also provided evidence for homing of uninfected and ring-stage iRBCs to the bone marrow, including the extra vascular compartment 58 . Altogether, there is evidence for both a genuine sexual commitment cycle in the bone marrow and for intravascular commitment with subsequent homing to this niche. However, more research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of parasite entry and exit at the bone marrow interface. Whereas merozoites are invasive stages with the intrinsic ability to invade and possibly migrate across host cells, transmigration of ring-stage iRBCs is more likely driven by the same machinery that facilitates intravasation of reticulocytes. Furthermore, the relative contribution of sexual commitment in the bone marrow versus in the blood to overall levels of gametocyte formation is unknown, but there is likely variation according to host conditions, according to host intrinsic parasite factors and between parasite species.",

In fact, panning experiments of iRBCs with endothelial cells from various tissues demonstrated that bone marrow-derived endothelial cells (BMECs) share binding properties with those from the brain 69 . Given the preferred localization of immature gametocytes among erythroblast islands, this parasite stage may interact with RBC precursors, including reticulocytes and/or macrophages, but not with BMECs. Early studies suggested adhesion of immature P. falciparum gametocytes to ICAM1 on BMECs 70 . However, further analysis demonstrated only minimal binding of immature gametocytes to BMECs compared with asexual stages 71,72 , arguing against a classical PfEMP1-mediated vascular cytoadherence mechanism. Indeed, both PfEMP1 and KAHRP are epigenetically silenced in gametocytes and these proteins are absent in all gametocyte stages 71, 73 . Interestingly, a recent study reported the binding of both asexual stages and immature P. falciparum gametocytes to human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a 3D culture system. This binding was trypsin-sensitive, but independent of PfEMP1 and ICAM1, yet the receptor for the interaction could not be identified 74 . In a separate study, no binding to RBC precursor cells was observed 75 . An initial proteomic analysis of immature gametocytes identified a large number of gametocyte-exported parasite proteins (GEXPs) and potential ligands for adhesion 76 .",

These two antigens have independently been characterized in asexual-stage parasites and were shown to interact with the human chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) 78 . CX3CL1 is a transmembrane protein expressed in many endothelial cells but also in bone marrow stromal cells, including MSCs and macrophages, and is responsible for retaining monocytes within the bone marrow 79 . As GEXP07 and GEXP10 are CX3CL1 receptor mimics, they may be involved in interactions between asexual and immature gametocytes and cells in the extravascular bone marrow niche, such as MSCs and macrophages. In addition to GEXP07 and GEXP10, most gametocyte antigens are also expressed in asexual parasites, suggesting shared functions in host cell interactions 77 . Given the shared binding phenotype to human bone marrow MSCs, it is most likely that such shared antigens are also involved in iRBC interactions in the extravascular bone marrow niche. Interestingly, the presence of parasite antigens on the gametocyte iRBC surface is limited to stages I and II, after which the antigens are gradually removed by as yet unknown processes 77 , coinciding with the observed loss of binding 74 . Invasion assays with P. falciparum and P. berghei have demonstrated that the earliest RBC precursor stage that can be invaded and support parasite growth is the orthochromatic erythroblast 51, 60, 80 , in the final 48-72 h of erythropoiesis. Interestingly, the remaining maturation times of invadable RBC stages and of the asexual parasite stage are similar across all known Plasmodium species.

            "text": "www.nature.com/nrmicro of all Plasmodium species so far investigated, except for P. falciparum, takes a similar length to the asexual cycle. By contrast, the maturation of P. falciparum gametocytes takes 10-14 days, during which they need to avoid premature release of the iRBC into circulation. The benefit of such an unusually long developmental time is not known, except that it is accompanied by an equally unusual level of host cell remodelling. Immature P. falciparum gametocytes become increasingly rigid up to stage IV before reverting into a deformable state at stage V 27, 81, 82 . The rigidity switch at the onset of stage V gametocytes is preceded by the loss of surface antigens on the iRBC surface between stage II and III gametocytes 77 , suggesting that the two processes are part of a coordinated remodelling of the host cell. A rigidity differential may serve the same purpose as in reticulocytes 83 , facilitating mechanical retention of the immature gametocytes, whereas only the mature infectious stage V is sufficiently deformable to enter the blood circulation. The switch to the deformable stage V appears to be triggered by a drop in the intracellular levels of cAMP, and drugs that increase cAMP levels (for example, the phospho diesterase inhibitor sildenafil citrate) increase the stiffness of mature gametocytes 84 . In mice, sildenafil citrate increased the number of P. berghei gametocytes in the bone marrow and spleen, supporting the notion that the deformability switch is required for a release of mature gametocytes into the circulation 58 . Changes in the parasite cytoskeleton and parasite-induced modifications of the host cell cytoskeleton have been suggested to underlie the deformability switch. P. falciparum gametocytes undergo drastic morphological changes during maturation, building up an extensive cytoskeleton of longitudinal microtubules until stage IV, which give these cells the classical elongated shape. Upon maturation to stage V, this microtubule cytoskeleton is disassembled, likely contributing to the increased deformability of this stage 25 . The variant STEVOR antigen that localizes to the erythrocyte membrane has been implicated in regu lating the deformability of gametocytes by interacting with the ankyrin complex, a component of the erythro cyte cytoskeleton 81, 85 . Deformability seems to depend on the phosphorylation status of STEVOR, which is regulated by intracellular cAMP levels, and STEVOR dephosphorylation and internalization render mature gametocytes deformable 85 . Yet even STEVORparasites partially retain rigidity during gametocyte maturation and respond to sildenafil citrate treatment, suggesting that other unknown mechanisms contribute to the deformability switch 85 . Notably, P. berghei and P. vivax gametocytes do not undergo major shape changes or build-up of a microtubule cytoskeleton during maturation. As their maturation time is only 2 days, and thus much shorter than for P. falciparum gametocytes, it is possible that gametocytes in these species do not need a mechanism for continued extravascular retention, but simply mature and enter the blood together with the host reticulocyte. Importantly, there are differences in parasite distribution within the extravascular bone marrow compartment between P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. berghei: whereas autopsy data from human P. falciparum infections and necropsies of non-human primates infected with P. vivax found most asexual and gametocyte stages in the parenchyma 51, 58 , intravital imaging and necropsy data from infected mice revealed a more even distribution between the parenchyma and sinusoids for P. berghei 58 . The physio logical relevance and underlying host-pathogen interactions related to these subtle but notable differences remain to be investigated. Intravital imaging has provided direct evidence of mature P. berghei gametocyte intravasation and leukocyte-like movement in both the extravascular and intravascular compartments of the bone marrow and spleen 58 . Similar phenotypes have yet to be investigated in P. falciparum and P. vivax. Mature gametocytes of all species must be ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal and hence present in the peripheral blood circulation of the dermis. There has been some speculation about a mature gametocyte reservoir in the peri pheral microcirculation of the skin 86, 87 , but so far there is no experimental evidence for such a phenotype.",

Currently used artemisinin combination therapies combine the fast-acting and short-lived artemisinin with a long-lasting partner drug, such as mefloquine or piperaquine 1 . These treatment regimens are based on bioavailability and efficacy measurements in the vascular blood compartment, which may be inadequate for parasite clearance in the bone marrow. For example, bone marrow-resident RBC precursors are metabolically more active than mature RBCs, and therefore intracellular pathogens, such as malaria parasites, may be exposed to reduced drug concentrations in these host cells owing to their increased turnover 88 . In addition, drug availability is reduced in the bone marrow owing to limited perfusion 89 . Exposing parasites to sublethal drug concentrations in this compartment mimics current in vitro protocols to select for drugresistant parasites 90 and therefore may increase the likelihood of emergence and spread of drug resistance. Some anti malarials, including artemisinin, also induce haemolysis and subsequent erythropoiesis in the bone marrow and spleen of infected mice and hence increase infection levels in the haematopoietic niche 60 . On the other hand, the unique metabolic environment of the bone marrow may also provide opportunities to increase the activity of drugs, as shown recently for the prodrug primaquine 91 . In addition, loss of mature gametocyte deformability in P. falciparum 84 and gametocyte accumulation in the bone marrow and spleen in P. berghei 58 upon sildenafil citrate treatment provide a proof-of-concept for a transmission-blocking drug. Systematic efforts using cellular and target-based high-throughput screens are underway to further explore blocking the deformability switch as a drug target 92, 93 . Bone marrow infection likely has an effect on the development of immunity, as the environment is naturally immune protected through mechanisms of central tolerance 94 .

However, para site sequestration in the bone marrow may also be an opportunity to induce immunity for vaccine develop ment. Identification of shared iRBC surface antigens that are involved in interactions of asexual parasites and gametocytes with the bone marrow could provide the basis for a new bloodstage vaccine that reduces the parasite burden and transmission simultaneously. Indeed, natural human antibodies against such shared antigens correlate with a reduced burden of asexual para sites and mature gametocytes in patients with malaria 77 . Longitudinal studies are required to identify and validate functional antibodies that could serve as a template for next-generation vaccine development. Persistence and recrudescence of a parasite reservoir in the bone marrow and spleen, as described in the rodent model upon drug treatment 60 , also create diagnostic challenges as infections may go undetected. It will be important to identify host and/or parasite markers for bone marrow infection independently of peripheral parasites to define the true parasite reservoir in the popu lation. An asymptomatic or undetected bone marrow parasite reservoir may be particularly relevant for parasite species that are either reticulocyte-restricted or have latent phases -or both, as is the case for P. vivax 98 .",

There have also been a series of advances in our understanding of bone marrow function and architecture in humans and animals in recent years 102 Finally, efficacy testing requires mosquito feeding assays, which are cumbersome. b | Alternatively, transmission can be blocked by targeting gametocytes (green) with stage V density in the circulating blood as a readout. Many antimalarials that are active against asexual bloodstage parasites (blue) are also active against immature gametocytes, including artemisinin and its derivatives. A few antimalarials are mostly active against stage V gametocytes, in particular primaquine. Identification of the bone marrow as a reservoir for asexual parasites and gametocytes opens new opportunities for interventions targeting both asexual parasite burden and transmission: (i) vaccines or human monoclonal antibodies could target receptor-ligand interactions required for parasite homing and extravasation, thereby blocking establishment of bone marrow infection and gametocyte development; (ii) vaccines or antibodies could also inhibit interactions at the erythroblast island or with mesenchymal stem cells, possibly triggering premature parasite release into the circulation and subsequent clearance in the spleen; and (iii) drugs that inhibit the deformability switch may lead to the accumulation of mature gametocytes in the bone marrow parenchyma and hence prevent their release into the circulation and their transmission.",

We anticipate that these recent developments will enable future research to address some of the major questions. How does parasite infection affect bone marrow function, including immunity? What is the molecular basis for parasite phenotypes, such as bone marrow homing and extravasation of young parasites, host-parasite interactions and intravasation of maturing parasites, and mobility of mature gametocytes? Can the first wave of merozoites emerging from the liver schizont directly home to the bone marrow? What is the role of the spleen as a reservoir for asexual parasites and gametocytes in different parasite lineages? Can we develop in vitro culture systems for P. vivax using bone marrow proxies? Is bone marrow recrudescence an alternative relapse mechanism in P. vivax and other parasites with hypnozoites?

Trophozoite and schizont stages of asexual P. falciparum parasites (blue) sequester in the capillaries of several organs, including the brain, lung, spleen and bone marrow. Cytoadherence of infected red blood cells (red) to endothelial cells and to uninfected red blood cells (rosetting) facilitates sequestration. The main parasite ligand is P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), which is exposed on the surface of infected red blood cells by knob-like structures. The different variants of PfEMP1 interact with diverse endothelial cell receptors, such as endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) and CD36. In pregnant women, P. falciparum also sequesters in the placenta through the interaction of the PfEMP1 variant var2CSA and the placental receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Ligand receptor interactions involved in rosetting are not clearly defined, but likely involve repetitive interspersed families of polypeptides (RIFIN) and subtelomeric variant open reading frame (STEVOR) as well as PfEMP1.",
