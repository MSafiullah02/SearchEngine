At first British Intercollegiate General Surgery Guidance on COVID-19 specifically recommended that \u2018laparoscopy should generally not be used\u2019 because of aerosol contamination with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has been rephrased to \u2018consider laparoscopy only in selected individual cases\u2019 the following day [14]. Publications cited state that there are no data or actually question whether there would be contamination [1115]. These latter and other recommendations therefore just advise to carefully consider whether we should use or avoid laparoscopic surgery [910]. As a matter of fact, laparoscopy might even protect against viral exposure through smoke, provided that CO2 and smoke are filtered and extracted, preferably using an integrated flow system with a continuous smoke evacuation through an Ultra Low Penetrating Air (ULPA) filter meeting the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses guidelines [816]. As ultrasonic sealing devices produce large amounts of smoke containing non-deactivated viral particles their use should be avoided [17].",

Additional criteria could be, asymptomatic for 7 days and not into contact with an COVID-19 patient within the last 14 days [21].
