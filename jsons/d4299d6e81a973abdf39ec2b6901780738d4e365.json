The socioeconomic implications are far-reaching and are likely to be felt for years to come. 1 In conjunction to vaccination programs and social distancing measures, nations have turned towards technological solutions in an attempt to track outbreaks and mitigate viral spread. These methods also allow for the strategic deployment of limited resources such as ventilators. The solutions are proving to be highly effective. However, digital surveillance raises serious concerns regarding governmental overreach and data privacy.",

In doing so however, we find ourselves in a timeless debate over safety and privacy. Our personal data can be used, potentially, to mitigate the devastating effects of COVID-19; illustrated by the slower spread in countries adopting the aforementioned tracking strategies. However, by 'handing' over our data, we are entrusting governments and private enterprises to uphold our liberty. This can set a dangerous precedence, albeit in the view of saving lives.
