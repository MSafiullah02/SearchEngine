Hong Kong has a hilly topography; hence, only 25% of the land is built-up areas (Ng, 2009). Land prices in Hong Kong have been increasing over the years. For example, in the Central Business District, rent prices has increased 33% between 2005 and 2007 (HKRVD, 2009). Owing to the limited land area and the increasing land prices, property developers are building taller and bulkier buildings with higher building plot ratios that occupy the entire site area in order to economically cope with the high land costs (Fig. 1\n). In addition, the Government of Hong Kong has the planned need to deal with an increasing population, which is projected to increase to 10 million in the next 30 years. Seeking ways to optimize the urban morphology of the city is a difficult and important task for urban planners.",

Stagnant air in urban areas has caused, among other issues, outdoor urban thermal comfort problems during the hot and humid summer months in Hong Kong. Stagnant air has also worsened urban air pollution by restricting dispersion in street canyon with high building-height-to-street-width ratios. The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has reported frequent occurrence of high concentrations of pollutants, such as NO2 and respirable particles (RSP) in urban areas like Mong Kok and Causeway Bay (Yim et al., 2009).

Two kinds of tools are frequently employed to study the wind environment of the city: wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted numerous urban-scale wind tunnel tests to understand the dispersion of particulate matters smaller than 10 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) (Ranade et al., 1990). Williams and Wardlaw (1992) conducted a large-scale wind tunnel study to describe the pedestrian-level wind environment in the city of Ottawa, Canada. The study identified areas of concern for planners. Plate (1999) developed the boundary layer wind tunnel studies to analyze urban atmospheric conditions, including wind forces on buildings, pedestrian comfort, and diffusion processes from point-sources of the city. Kastner-Klein et al. (2001) analyzed the interaction between wind turbulence and the effects induced by vehicles moving inside the urban canopy. Wind velocity and turbulence scales throughout the street canyons of the city were analyzed using smoke visualization (Perry et al., 2004). In 2004, the US EPA's Office of Research and Development (EPA-ORD) conducted a city-scale wind tunnel study to analyze the airflow and pollutant dispersion in the Manhattan area (Perry et al., 2004). Kubota et al. (2008) conducted wind tunnel tests and revealed the relationship between plan area fraction (\u03bb\nP) and the mean wind-velocity ratio at the pedestrian level in residential neighborhoods of major Japan cities. In Hong Kong, the Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility has conducted numerous tests at the city, district, and urban scale to understand the wind availability and flow characteristics of Hong Kong (HKPD, 2008).",

            "text": "Apart from wind tunnels, CFD model simulation can be helpful at the initial urban planning stage in providing a \u201cqualitative impression\u201d of the wind environment. Mochida et al. (1997) conducted a CFD study to analyze the meso-scale climate in the Greater Tokyo area. Murakami et al. (1999) used CFD simulations to analyze the wind environment at the urban scale. Kondo et al. (2006) used CFD simulations to analyze the diffusion of NOx at the most polluted roadside areas around the Ikegami-Shinmachi crossroads in Japan. Letzel et al. (2008) conducted studies of urban turbulence characteristics using the urban version of the parallelized Large-eddy Simulation (LES) model (PALM) which is superior to the conventional Reynolds-averaged models (RANS). Using the Earth Simulator, Ashie et al. (2009) conducted the largest urban CFD simulation of Tokyo to understand the effects of building blocks on the thermal environment of Tokyo. Ashie noted that the air temperatures around Ginza and JR Shimbashi are much higher than in the surrounding areas of Hama Park and Sumida River. Ashie argued that the high air temperature can be attributed to the bulky buildings at Ginza and JR Shimbashi that obstruct the incoming sea breezes (Ashie et al., 2009). Yim et al. (2009) used CFD simulation to investigate the air pollution dispersion in a typical Hong Kong urban morphology. In general, using CFD for urban-scale investigation has been gaining momentum in the scientific circle. Recently, two important documents that provide guidelines for CFD usage have been published: AIJ Guidebook (AIJ, 2007, Tominaga et al., 2008) and COST action C14 (Frank, 2006).",

The total drag on a roughness surface includes both a pressure drag (\u03c4\ntp) on the roughness elements and a skin drag (\u03c4\nts) on the underlying surface (Shao and Yang, 2005). In this study, only the pressure drag is considered. This is because the skin drag is relatively small and is not a factor that can be controlled at the urban scale. Oke (1987) provided the logarithmic wind profile in a thermally neutral atmosphere, which is a semi-empirical relationship that acts as a function of two aerodynamic characteristics: roughness length (z0) and the zero-plane displacement height (zd). For setting a base for this logarithmic wind profile that recognized the irregular flow caused by physical bulk in the urban canopy, a new \u201cground surface\u201d is set (Oke, 2006). As shown in Fig. 2, the height of the new surface is z0 + zd (Oke, 2006). The reliable evaluation of such aerodynamic characteristics of urban areas is significant in depicting and predicting urban wind behaviors (Grimmond and Oke, 1999).",

The Davenport Classification is a surface type classification based on the assorted surface roughness values that use high-quality observations (Davenport et al., 2000). It covers a wide range of surface types. This method is not too helpful to be used to describe urban permeability in high density cities, because most of the urban areas could only be described in Class 8 \u2018Skimming: City centre (z0 \u2265 2)\u2019. Compared with the micrometeorological method, the morphometric method estimates the aerodynamic characteristics, such as z0 and zd, using empirical equations (Kutzbach, 1961, Lettau, 1969, Raupach, 1992, Bottema, 1996, MacDonald et al., 1998). Grimmond and Oke (1999) validated the empirical models by Kutzbach, Lettau, Raupach, Bottema and Macdonald. Reasonable relationships between z0 and frontal area index (\u03bb\nf(\u03b8)) for low and medium density forms have been found; however, there is a tendency of overestimation of z0 for higher density cases (Bottema, 1996).",

Having combined the data obtained using MM5 and the data obtained from an upper air sounding station of the Hong Kong observatory in 2004, the CALMET model adjusts the estimated meteorological fields for the kinematic effects of terrain, slope flows, and terrain blocking effects to reflect the effects of a fine-scale terrain in producing wind fields at 100 m resolutions (Yim et al., 2007). In the CALMET model simulation, the vertical coordinates are set with 10 levels: 10, 30, 60, 120, 230, 450, 800, 1250, 1750, and 2600 m (Yim et al., 2007).",

Therefore, to estimate the local roughness of every grid when buildings cross grid cells (Fig. 7), a new method of also accounting for the cross-section areas (red areas) to be included in the frontal areas of the corresponding grid cell is proposed.

This also allows the inter-connectivity of open spaces for urban air ventilation, and allows planners to take urban breezeways into account and design in accordance with the recommendations of the HKPSG (HKPD, 2006) (Fig. 25\n):For better urban air ventilation in a dense, hot-humid city, breezeways along major prevailing wind directions and air paths intersecting the breezeways should be provided in order to allow effective air movements into the urban area to remove heat, gases and particulates and to improve the micro-climate of urban environment.\nBreezeways should be created in forms of major open ways, such as principal roads, inter-linked open spaces, amenity areas, non-building areas, building setbacks and low-rise building corridors, through the high-density/high-rise urban form. They should be aligned primarily along the prevailing wind direction routes, and as far as possible, to also preserve and funnel other natural air flows including sea and land breezes and valley winds, to the developed area.\nThe disposition of amenity areas, building setbacks and non-building areas should be linked, and widening of the minor roads connecting to major roads should be planned in such a way to form ventilation corridors/air paths to further enhance wind penetration into inner parts of urbanized areas. For effective air dispersal, breezeways and air paths should be perpendicular or at an angle to each other and extend over a sufficiently long distance for continuity.\n",
