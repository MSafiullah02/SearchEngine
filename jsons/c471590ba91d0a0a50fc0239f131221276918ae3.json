The reported mortality for the three out of seven Greek patients under MV appears high. However, it needs to be taken into consideration that sHLH is accompanied by substantial mortality as high as 67% in the case of sHLH developing in patients with sepsis (Kyriazopoulou et al., 2017; Shakoory et al., 2016) . This is not the first time when favourable Anakinra responses are shown in sHLH in adults. Several case-series report similar responses of Anakinra treatment in patients with HLH secondary to adult onset Still's disease (Lenert et al., 2016) and systemic infections (Kumar et al., 2017; Wohlfarth et al., 2019) . Anakinra was administered subcutaneously and at lower doses than those used herein. It was also co-administered with corticosteroids, antibiotics and antivirals. These authors highly recommend to measure the HScore when the patient is deteriorating and to administer treatment with Anakinra when sHLH is diagnosed.",

These patients were less severe than those described herein since they were not under MV and they had lower ferritin levels. Although HScore was not criterion for treatment, these published outcomes support the results of our case-series showing favourable responses with Anakinra in the respiratory function of patients with COVID-19 who scored positive for the HScore. The one case of the non-ICU patient generates consideration for an early time window before the need of MV where immunomodulation may benefit.",

The HScore is developed by experts by the analysis of a cohort of 314 patients and provides points for each of nine variables: degree of core temperature; hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly; number of cytopenias;",
