Viruses may invade the CNS through the choroid plexus or by direct penetration of the endothelium of cerebral blood vessels. Nonhematogenous routes of transmission also exist; these routes may be important in the pathogenesis of rabies or adult-onset herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). In these cases, the virus may infect the brain by retrograde travel along axons in the spinal cord or the brain. With viral replication in neural cells, cell death or dysfunction results. The extent of the neuronal damage may contribute to the clinical severity of viral meningoencephalitis.",

Certain viral infections occur worldwide, infect humans of all ages, and display little or no seasonal variation; others are specific to season and geographic area, especially those caused by insectborne viruses (Table 64-3). Typical clinical findings with enteroviral infections are myocarditis and pleurodynia, which can cause epidemics, especially in the summer and fall. Acute HIV infection should be considered in high-risk populations and often presents with a mononucleosis syndrome. Contact with rodents often is an indication of possible infection with LCM, and patients with HSV-2 often have primary genital lesions. Mumps, although less common since the widespread use of vaccines, can have associated parotitis. Focal neurologic deficits are seen with HSE, although there is no seasonality. The characteristic rash of VZV is seen with this infection, and encephalitis in children often is manifested by cerebellar ataxia. The mononucleosis syndrome can be seen in patients with EBV- or CMV-associated encephalitis. A history of mosquito bite may be helpful in detecting the common arbovirus-associated encephalitides. Adenovirus may have preceding respiratory symptoms. Rabies characteristically is associated with an animal bite, although many cases have occurred where this history is lacking.\n",

In the case of serum, whether the patient recovers or continues to be ill over several weeks, if virus cultures are negative, a convalescent serum should be obtained and both the acute and convalescent samples tested for antibody titers. An exception is arbovirus encephalitis, in which a single high titer in an acute phase serum may be diagnostic.
