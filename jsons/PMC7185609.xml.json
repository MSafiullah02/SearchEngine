To reduce the health risk from bioaerosols exposures, various controlling technologies for this contaminant, including photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) (Grinshpun et al., 2007, Keller et al., 2005; Lin and Li, 2003a, Lin and Li, 2003b; Vohra et al., 2005, Vohra et al., 2006) and negative air ionization (NAI) (Grinshpun et al., 2007; Mitchell & King, 1994; Noyce & Hughes, 2002), have been investigated.",

            "text": "\nTiO2 PCO has been applied for the purification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Luo and Ollis, 1996, Yu and Lee, 2007; Yu, Lee, Huang, Wu, & Yang, 2006) and for the disinfection of microbial contaminations in liquid phase (Cho et al., 2005, Christensen et al., 2003, Lee et al., 1997, Sunada et al., 1998). Moreover, the mechanisms of PCO for the removal of microbial contaminations and VOCs have also been reported (Cho et al., 2005, Maness et al., 1999, Sunada et al., 1998, Yu and Lee, 2007; Yu et al., 2006). Lin and Li (2003a) demonstrated that the effectiveness of a photocatalytic filter on the removal of bioaerosols was insignificant, which might be caused by a lack of enough time (on the order of 1 s) for the microorganisms to contact and react with the TiO2 and reactive species generated by the PCO reaction. Some studies also showed that the destruction of microorganisms increased significantly with the time exposure to the photocatalyst and the contact surface between the microorganism and photocatalyst (Keller et al., 2005, Vohra et al., 2006). Lin and Li (2003a) recommended that the reaction time of the photocatalyst with the collected microorganisms could be extended by enhancing the filtration efficiency of the photocatalytic filter. NAI seems to be one of the good choices to fulfill this purpose (Lee, Yermakov, & Grinshpun, 2004a). Additionally NAI can be used as a removal method for bioaerosols (Fan et al., 2002, Grinshpun et al., 2007, Mitchell and King, 1994, Noyce and Hughes, 2002) The removal of aerosol contaminants by unipolar air ionization (usually NAI) in indoor environments (Grabarczyk, 2001, Grinshpun et al., 2007; Lee, Yermakov, & Grinshpun, 2004b) or confined indoor spaces (Grinshpun et al., 2005) has been studied. Mayya, Sapra, Khan, and Sunny (2004) developed a model to analyze the physical factors which influenced the aerosol removal in the presence of unipolar air ionization.",

In our previous study (Wu, Lee, Cheng, Yang, & Yu, 2006), we found that NAI was more efficient in the removal of small particles (0.03\u03bcm) than large particles (0.3\u03bcm), and this result was attributed to that smaller particles had higher mobility.

(2004) in which the aerosol removal efficiency was higher for particle size smaller than 0.3\u03bcm.

This might be due to the positive effect of RH on the performance of PCO reaction (Luo and Ollis, 1996, Yu and Lee, 2007; Yu et al., 2006). When the TiO2 absorbed a photon with energy higher than the band gap of TiO2, an electron\u2013hole pair would be formed. The electron and hole would react with O2 and H2O to generate reactive species, such as H2O2 and OH\u00b7, which could inactivate the microorganisms on the surface of TiO2 (Cho et al., 2005, Sunada et al., 1998). The production of these reactive species increased on increasing the RH. Consequently, the \u03b7UPFenh under RH 50% and 70% were higher than those under RH 30%. Theoretically, the positive effect of RH also worked on the removal of E. coli. However, owing to the lower filtration efficiency, E. coli cells had relatively less chance to contact with TiO2 photocatalyst. Therefore, the positive effect of RH on the removal of E. coli was not obviously observed.",

The negative air ion generator and UV lamps were turned off after 4 h operating, and the removal efficiencies decreased dramatically. The dramatic decrease in the removal efficiencies might mainly result from a great quantity of re-suspension of the test microorganisms deposited on the filter fiber and the wall of the reactor after the NAI (electrostatic) and PCO effects were eliminated.",

For the aerosolized E. coli and C. famata, the increase of RH had a positive effect on their removal efficiencies of NAI and PCO, which was relevant to the enhancement effect of humidity on the generation of reactive species (H2O2 and OH\u00b7). The increase of RH had a positive effect on the \u03bb virus phage removal efficiency of photocatalytic filter (filtration), PCO, and the combination of NAI and PCO.
