Coronaviruses were known to cause severe and, therefore, economically important diseases in chickens [1] and pigs [2], but, while a number of coronaviruses were known to infect humans, the symptoms are usually mild in healthy adults, akin to a common cold, and only rarely cause more severe pneumonia. In 2003, however, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged, causing 8273 confirmed infections, of which 775 resulted in death [3], [4], [5]. Most of the cases were linked to China, Hong Kong and Singapore, with the only major outbreak outside of this area occurring in Toronto, Canada. SARS-CoV had a zoonotic origin, having emerged from bats, via civet cats, to infect humans [6], [7]. Although there have been no reported cases of SARS-CoV infection in humans after this, a recent study has shown that the parental virus still exists in bats in China [8].",

Since then, 238 cases have been positively identified, of which 92 have resulted in death (www.who.org). All of the cases have been linked to countries on or near the Arabian peninsula (KSA, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and United Arab Emirates). Cases in other parts of the world, notably Europe, involved recent travelers to the Middle East region or were closely linked with people who did [11]. Patients infected with MERS-CoV present at the hospital with symptoms consistent with a severe lower respiratory tract infection and, in some cases, develop kidney failure. MERS-CoV is closely related to bat coronaviruses found in China, Europe and Africa, suggesting a zoonotic origin, similar to SARS-CoV, however the reservoir of MERS-CoV has not yet been identified.",

            "text": "Previous efforts to create a vaccine for SARS-CoV have utilized a number of approaches, but none is currently licensed for use and a recent study of four putative SARS-CoV vaccines yielded negative results [17]. Initial studies suggested that whole inactivated SARS-CoV could be used as an effective vaccination [18], [19], [20], however further work has suggested that the level of protection induced by inactivated SARS-CoV is incomplete and fails to prevent SARS-CoV symptoms, while also inducing increased eosinophilia in vaccinated animals [17], [21]. Therefore, the most likely candidates for coronavirus vaccine platforms are based on spike subunits [22], [23], recombinant viruses expressing SARS-CoV proteins [24], [25], [26], DNA plasmids expressing SARS-CoV proteins [27], [28], [29] or virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], however all of these approaches come with their own safety concerns and approval processes. There are currently no approved vaccines for MERS-CoV, but early studies using a modified vaccinia virus and replication deficient MERS-CoV have been shown to induce antibodies capable of neutralizing MERS-CoV in vitro\n[35], [36]. Ideally, vaccines for highly pathogenic viruses, including coronaviruses, should be able to be made rapidly, on demand and in conjunction with approved adjuvants using approved techniques [37].",

            "text": "When Matrix M1 adjuvant is used in conjunction with MERS-CoV S for inoculation, the increase in levels of neutralizing antibody at day 21 post-inoculation are significantly higher compared to the sera from mice inoculated with MERS-S alone (27\u201368 fold) and 3\u20134 fold higher than sera from mice inoculated with MERS-S plus Alum (for example 1 \u03bcg MERS-S alone GMT = 49 compared to 1 \u03bcg MERS-S with Alum GMT = 735 compared to 1 \u03bcg MERS-S with Matrix M1 GMT = 3378; p\n < 0.001), indicating that Matrix M1 promotes production of anti-MERS-CoV-S neutralizing antibodies higher than that seen when Alum is used as the adjuvant. There is no significant difference between dosing mice with 1 \u03bcg of MERS-CoV-S or 3 \u03bcg of MERS-CoV-S in the presence of Matrix M1 (for example, at day 21, 1 \u03bcg MERS-S plus Matrix M1 GMT = 3378 compared to 3 \u03bcg MERS-S plus Matrix M1 GMT = 1194; p\n > 0.05), again suggesting that lower doses of MERS-S can be used for effective vaccination in the presence of Matrix M1. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between neutralizing antibodies in the sera from day 21 compared to day 45 (for example 1 \u03bcg MERS-S plus Matrix M1 at day 21 GMT = 3378 compared to day 45 GMT = 1940; p\n > 0.05), suggesting that, in the presence of Matrix M1, the vaccination course causes early production of neutralizing antibodies that are maintained. These data demonstrate that the MERS-S vaccine platform can be used to induce a neutralizing antibody response in mice. We also demonstrate that the Matrix M1 adjuvant significantly enhances the level of neutralizing antibody produced compared to Alum.",

The recent emergences of SARS-CoV, in 2003, and MERS-CoV, in 2012, have demonstrated the importance of the Coronaviridae virus family as an important group of emerging pathogens. Previous efforts to develop vaccines to SARS-CoV have encompassed many methods, but have yielded variable results. In this study we describe a novel method for development of protein nanoparticles carrying the spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that were able to induce significant neutralizing antibody responses in mice. The nanoparticles contain only MERS-S or SARS-S and no other potentially immunogenic viral or insect proteins. The formation of amphiphilic membrane proteins aggregates (protein nanoparticles), used in this study, which are relatively homogeneous in size, soluble in aqueous media, and used as a platform for vaccines was first described by Simons et al. [40]. Recently a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccine was shown to be highly immunogenic, inducing protective immune responses against conformational epitopes [41]. In a phase 1 human study the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine was well tolerated and induced neutralizing antibodies at levels associated with decreased hospitalization from RSV in children [42].",
