The African rodents that spread the disease had been legally shipped from Ghana to the United States (U.S.) in April 2003 for the pet trade. The shipment included a number of species, and studies indicated that two rope squirrels (Funisciurus), a Gambian rat (Cricetomys), and three dormice (Dryomys) were carrying the monkeypox virus.34 By early July, 71 nonfatal human cases from six states were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).10 Before this event, nonendangered rodents from Africa were legally shipped into the U.S. for the pet trade with no regulatory controls. Subsequently, restrictions were placed on U.S. importation of African rodents.",

The disease first spread to Hong Kong and thereafter across five continents and 25 countries via infected people.71 In April 2003 a new coronavirus was discovered to be the causative agent. In July 2003 the World Health Organization (WHO) listed the number of probable SARS cases in humans at 8437, with 813 deaths.8 Evidence of viral infection, often without signs, was also detected in palm civets (Paguma) farmed in the region.33 The initial suggestion of a link between civets and SARS led to a government directive to cull more than 10,000 masked palm civets in the province despite the ambiguity of the disease link.9 Later, viral evidence was also detected in raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes) and ferret badgers (Melogale) as well as domestic cats. It now appears that the palm civet served as an artificial market-induced host or amplification host, along with a number of other possible species. Subsequent studies determined that three species of horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus)\n28 were found to be the natural reservoir host for closely related SARS-like coronaviruses.51, 56\n",

The first three known outbreaks of Ebola occurred between 1976 and 1979 in DRC and Sudan. Between 2000 and 2004, five human Ebola outbreaks were documented in western-central Africa. Epidemiologic studies indicated that these outbreaks resulted from multiple introductions of virus from infected animal sources. The index cases were mainly hunters, and all were infected while handling dead animals, including gorilla (Gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and duiker (Cephalophus).\n53 Thereafter, outbreaks spread quickly between people, especially through caregivers, and were documented to almost wipe out entire villages.31, 52 In people the symptoms are referable to multiple organ effects with internal and external hemorrhaging. The Zaire subtype of Ebola virus has been known to have a case-fatality rate of almost 90%, and the Sudan subtype has a rate of approximately 50%.82\n",

Wild birds, predominantly ducks, geese, and shorebirds, are the reservoir species for the low-pathogenic strains of avian influenza A virus (LPAI) in nature.95 In these species it does not usually cause illness. The virus is subtyped on the basis of the antigenic properties of hemagglutinin (HA, or H) and neuraminidase (NA, or N) glycoproteins; 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been demonstrated. Viruses containing subtypes H5 and H7 have been observed to become highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry. HPAI has been isolated primarily from commercially raised birds, including chickens, turkeys, quail, guinea fowl, and ostrich (Struthio camelus). Influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes have also been detected in a variety of mammals, including humans. The H5N1 influenza A viruses have been detected in birds, pigs, cats, leopards, tigers,44 and people in Asia.64\n",
