Digital platforms are characterised as having layered modular architecture with a core module and loosely-coupled components [1]. By their nature, digital platforms facilitate change and evolution of their use through re-configuration of their architecture and components. There is widespread use of digital platforms in various organisations and sectors [2, 3]. Within the developing country health sector, some health insurance organisations have implemented digital platforms while others are in the process of doing so amidst some challenges.",

Furstenau and Auschra [8] also investigate strategies to implement and scale digital platforms in highly-regulated settings such as health care. The authors observed that openness on code and content layers fuel platform growth and contribution. However, financial risks and uncertainties in health care regulations can result in platform failure and avoid opportunities to achieve potential benefits. Implementing and scaling digital platform \u2013 especially in health care-based organisations \u2013 is a difficult task and requires the resolution of tensions around autonomy-related benefits and control [8, 13].",

The extended family system results from the communal rather than individualistic social network based on a fundamental need to care for other members of the extended family [34]. This system typically includes a man, his wife, children or offspring in addition to other kin. By extension of this system, reverence is accorded family heads and community leaders. In practice, family heads can register for national health insurance membership on behalf of an entire household while community leaders do same for community members. In secondary schools, mass registration of students unto the national health insurance can be linked to a single phone number of a school head. Within the NHIS mobile authentication platform, when a member visits the health provider to access health care, the member after consultation receives a notification on their mobile device asking them to confirm whether they were at the health provider on a given day and time to access health care. This verification system is for purposes of enabling the NHIS to link attendance to claims received from the health provider, many of which are fraudulently sent for payment.",

By applying institutional theory to analyse digital platform in national health insurance, our work contributes to digital platform research in the health sector in general and health insurance in particular. The findings show that digital platform is a promising means to help health insurance organisations in developing countries to achieve national coverage. However, to derive the benefits, health insurance managers should pay attention to institutional enablers and constraints that affect digital platform development and use.",
