This preparation leaves the clinician confident and free of undue anxiety that can arise when he or she is presented with a concerned, overprotective owner. The veterinarian should be ready to apply his or her acumen and therapeutic skills toward treating the patient.

When a sleep-deprived, drowsy, and irritable animal is brought to the clinician, subtle signs of diseases may be overlooked. This is especially true with hamsters. When possible, receptionists should schedule appointments for rats and hamsters during early evening hours. Appointment times are not as critical for gerbils and mice. Taking the time to explain the reasoning behind appointment scheduling to clients who are unwilling to make an evening appointment often not only changes their minds but also sets the veterinarian-client relationship off to a good start.",

Pet rodents often selectively eat only one ingredient (e.g., sunflower seeds) when offered mixed-seed, vegetable, and fruit diets. In households with children, a regular feeding routine may not occur, and pets are inappropriately fed by doting children. Owners are often ignorant of the availability of specially formulated diets for laboratory rodents. These diets, which are pelleted, are convenient and nutritionally balanced sources of nourishment. However, most diets are only available in 50-lb bags and can only be purchased from wholesale feed distributors. A list of these diets and the feed manufacturers (and their web sites) can be found in the annual Buyer's Guide issue of Lab Animal (see Suggested Reading and Resources). Presently, two feed manufacturers, Oxbow Pet Products (Murdock, NE; www.oxbowhay.com) and Mazuri (St Louis, MO; www.mazuri.com have developed pelleted diets for pet rodents and rabbits. The diets are available in 2-, 5-, 10-, and 50-lb bags by direct order or from selected retail locations.

Although this may seem rather obvious, much of the literature describing the maladies of pet rodents has been indiscriminately inferred from conditions seen in laboratory rodents. The diagnosis and treatment of pet rodents involve evaluation and care of an individual animal in a household, not the health management of rodents from a research colony. Derangements likely to be seen in practice include trauma-induced injuries, infectious diseases, and problems related to nutrition and aging; genetic disorders are uncommon. Natural infections that would be considered rare in a laboratory animal colony often are transmitted to rodent pets by other pets and by children; for example, pet animals other than rodents are a major reservoir of dermatophytes,24 and human beings are the main natural host of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.41 Rodents used for research are maintained in tightly controlled environments designed to reduce the impact of unwanted variables in animal experiments.18 However, pet rodents generally are exposed to temperature, humidity, and light-cycle changes; a broad range of foods; numerous microorganisms borne by animals and human beings; and various types of handling.

A survey from a large research animal diagnostic laboratory indicated skin disease in mice represents 25% of all cases (for all species) submitted for diagnosis.37 I categorize four groups of skin problems in mice: behavioral disorders, husbandry-related problems, microbiologic and parasitic infections, and idiopathic conditions. Behavioral, husbandry-related, and infectious causes of skin disease are relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. However, many skin diseases characterized by chronic or ulcerated skin (often secondarily colonized by bacteria) are diagnosed as idiopathic. This group is commonly unresponsive to either topical or systemic treatment, and affected individuals are often euthanatized.",

Barbering is a unique condition seen in group-housed mice in which the dominant mouse nibbles off the whiskers and hair around the muzzle and eyes of cagemates (Fig. 29-1\n). There are no other lesions, and only one mouse (the dominant one) retains all its fur. Removing the dominant mouse stops barbering; frequently, however, another mouse assumes the dominant role. Barbering is often seen in female mice caged together. Male mice, except littermates raised together from birth, are more likely to fight, often very savagely, and inflict severe bite wounds on one another, especially over the rump, tail, and shoulders.",

            "text": "CRD is the best understood multifactorial respiratory infection in rats. M. pulmonis is the major component of CRD, also known as murine respiratory mycoplasmosis. Rats may live 2 to 3 years with CRD. Clinical signs are highly variable, and initial infection develops without any clinical signs. Early signs involve both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts and may include snuffling, nasal discharge, polypnea, weight loss, hunched posture, ruffled coat, head tilt, and red tears.15, 35 Thoracic radiographs may be helpful in the diagnosis of CRD (Fig 29-5\n). The most important aspect of CRD for clinicians is that respiratory mycoplasmosis varies greatly in disease expression because of environmental, host, and organismal factors that influence the host-pathogen relationship. Examples of such factors include intracage ammonia levels; concurrent Sendai virus, coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus), pneumonia virus of mice, rat respiratory virus, or CAR bacillus infection; the genetic susceptibility of the host; the virulence of the Mycoplasma strain; and vitamin A or E deficiency.15 For many years, the standard treatment for laboratory rats was to add tetracycline to sweetened water. However, this treatment is ineffective in rats because blood antibiotic concentrations are below minimum inhibitory concentrations, and pulmonary tissue concentration of tetracycline is noninhibitory. Instead, administer enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO q12h for 7 days) in combination with doxycycline hyclate (5 mg/kg PO q12h for 7 days). Although mycoplasma and CAR bacillus are susceptible to this antibiotic therapy, the respiratory viruses are not. In addition, certain strains of rats have a heightened cellular immune response to mycoplasma that aggravates respiratory damage. Therefore, warn owners that antibiotic treatment will not cure CRD but may alleviate clinical signs. Reducing ammonia levels in cages by removing bedding and using clean paper daily may also help. Despite developing high antibody titers to mycoplasma and high antibiotic tissue levels, affected animals typically have persistent M. pulmonis infection. Chronic signs of infection often include middle ear infection (by way of the eustachian tube); ciliostasis and subsequent buildup of lysozyme-rich inflammatory exudate in airways; and, eventually, bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis from inflammatory damage to the bronchiolar membranes. Abscesses may develop in scattered areas of one or both lungs. In these animals with advanced CRD, reducing ammonia levels in cages and administering bronchodilators and low levels of short-acting corticosteroids are also sometimes helpful in reducing clinical signs.",

In CPN, the kidneys are enlarged and pale and have a pitted, mottled surface that often contains pinpoint cysts (Fig. 29-9\n). Lesions consist of a progressive glomerulosclerosis and myriad tubulointerstitial disease primarily involving the convoluted proximal tubule (Fig. 29-10\n).27 The most striking change in renal function is a proteinuria level exceeding 10 mg/day that progressively increases in severity with age. The features of CPN are qualitatively similar among different strains of laboratory rats, but the onset, incidence, and severity of the disease vary considerably. The disease occurs earlier and is of greater severity in males than in females; urinary protein excretion averaging 137 mg/day has been documented in 18-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas excretion averaging 76 mg/day was reported in female rats of the same age.65 Dietary factors appear to have an important role in the progression of CPN. Restricting calories, feeding diets low in protein (4%-7%), and limiting the source of dietary protein reduce the incidence and severity of CPN. Feeding soy protein (as opposed to casein) and substantially restricting calories reduce the incidence and severity of CPN; feeding low-calorie diets that contain high protein levels does not. Exposure to drugs and chemicals also exacerbates CPN. Treatment is supportive and involves feeding a low-protein diet and administering anabolic steroids.",

Diagnosis is based on documenting classic signs seen in dogs, such as a history of polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia; clinical signs of alopecia and hyperpigmentation; and high concentrations of plasma cortisol and serum alkaline phosphatase. Reference values of cortisol concentrations are low compared with those of other species and range from 0.5 to 1.0 \u03bcg/dL in normal males and females.76 Hamsters may secrete both cortisol and corticosterone56; therefore, at present, meaningful measurement of plasma cortisol concentrations in hamsters is empirical. If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected, the cause, such as hypersecretion by a functional tumor, primary adrenal hyperplasia, or excess adrenocorticotropic hormone production, often is more difficult to determine. Hamsters respond to exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation.76 In the clinical report of the three hamsters, one hamster that was treated with metyrapone (8 mg PO q24h for 1 month) responded well; another hamster treated with o,p\u2032-DDD (mitotane) (5 mg PO q24h for 1 month) did not improve and was then given a similar dose of metyrapone, also without success.4 Further research needs to be done on this syndrome.",

Cleanse the ocular area gently with an ophthalmic wash, and lubricate the eye with sterile ophthalmic lubricant. Gently retract the lid margins around the globe until the eye returns to its normal position. Treat the eye with an antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for a minimum of 7 to 10 days.

In older hamsters, lymphoma is the most frequently observed neoplasm of the hematopoietic system.71 These tumors are often multicentric, involving the thymus, thoracic lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, superficial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other sites. Cytology of the tumors is variable. A second variation, cutaneous lymphoma, which resembles mycosis fungoides, an epidermotropic T-cell lymphoma in humans, is seen in adult hamsters.29 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, patchy alopecia, and exfoliative erythroderma have been described in affected animals. Pathologists have noted dense infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes in the dermis, with extension into the epidermis. The third variation is an epizootic of lymphoma in young hamsters. The causative agent is hamster polyomavirus (HaPV).4 When HaPV is first introduced into a naive population of breeding hamsters, an epizootic of lymphoma, with an incidence as high as 80%, can result. Once enzootic in a hamster population, the occurrence of lymphoma declines to a much lower level. Enzootically infected hamsters develop HaPV skin tumors rather than lymphoma. Hamsters with HaPV lymphoma appear thin, often with palpable abdominal masses. Tumors often arise in the mesentery but can arise in the axillary and cervical lymph nodes. The tumors are often lymphoid, but erythroblastic, reticulosarcomatous, and myeloid types occur. Anecdotal reports of chemotherapy in hamsters have been based on protocols using drugs that can be administered subcutaneously, orally, or intraperitoneally at dosages used in other small animals.",

The cause is believed to be an increase in the secretion of porphyrins by the harderian gland (as in chromodacryorrhea in rats), which act as a primary skin irritant. Various staphylococcal species (S. aureus and S. xylosus) may act synergistically to produce the dermatitis.10, 68 Stress may cause excessive harderian gland secretion. Two examples of stress are overcrowding and exposure to an environmental humidity of greater than 50% (in this case, the coat stands out and appears matted instead of lying sleekly against the body). Gerbils require sandbathing to keep their coats from becoming oily. Keeping the gerbil in a dry environment, cleaning its face, and providing soft clay or sand bedding instead of abrasive wood chip bedding usually alleviate the problem.

Unlike rats or mice, if a gerbil is picked up by the tip of its tail, the skin often slips off, leaving a raw, exposed tail that eventually becomes necrotic and sheds (Fig. 29-15\n). If the tail skin is lost, surgically amputate the bare tail where the skin ends. The tail usually sloughs if it is left untreated. When picking up a gerbil, avoid grasping the tail unless it is gently held at the base. The best holding technique involves placing the palm of the hand over the gerbil's back and encircling the body with thumb and fingers. Gerbils bite if they are not handled securely, despite the claim in many reviews that they rarely bite human handlers regardless of provocation.",

However, the medical information in these books should be carefully reviewed by the veterinarian. Purchasing some of these books and then recommending them to pet rodent owners is an effective method of educating clients and establishing a good rapport with them. The books are generally less expensive than veterinary textbooks and are written for a range of age groups (e.g., children and parents) and levels of interest. Barron's Educational Series and Dorling Kindersley are two reputable publishers of readily available books. TFH Publications, another reputable publisher, no longer publishes. Access www.tfh.com for availability of titles.",
