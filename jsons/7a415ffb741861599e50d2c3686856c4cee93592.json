In this context, unexplained pulmonary infectious diseases may be investigated prospectively, as well as retrospectively, in archival tissues. Traditionally, microbial identification has relied primarily on serologic assays and culture techniques. Serologic assays characteristically require the collection of paired serum samples to demonstrate rising antibody titers against a specific pathogen. Certain circumstances, including immunocompromised states, early therapy, or rapid death, may preclude the development of diagnostic antibody responses. Finally, serologic tests may occasionally give a nonspecific result, especially if only a single sample is available for evaluation.

            "text": "Because of their distinct particulate organizations and thick membrane-bound structures, the ultrastructural morphology of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses tends to be preserved well even in routinely processed archival paraffin sections. Very frequently, the pathogens are localized in certain small areas of tissues and organs, and thus random sampling from a fresh material may be fruitless for the EM study. When pathologists recognize pathogens only in a few cells in H&E preparations, the cells of focus can be examined in a targeted way by additionally cutting paraffin sections. To do this, an inverted beam capsule method should be applied to the area containing the infected cells after performing H&E staining. If specific antibodies or probes are available, this approach can be performed after diaminobenzidine-mediated immunoperoxidase staining (pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy) or in situ hybridization histochemistry. Because of excellent permeability into the tissue sections, false negativity by insufficient penetration of antibodies or probes occurs very infrequently. This also helps us confirm the specificity of the antibodies and probes. The HTD now caters less for civil servants, and more for business, the armed forces, and tourist patients; and increasingly, in the last decade, for immigrants from the tropics. The most notable influx has been refugees and immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa.",

Many mortuaries are not well equipped for this, and many pathologists and anatomical pathology technologists do not wish to undertake this work. It is likely that the examination of these known and suspected cadavers will increasingly be concentrated in a small number of regional centres, where the capability and the expertise in interpreting the pathology is present. The next decade will also see profound changes in how autopsies in England & Wales are commanded. The decline in consented autopsies may continue, and it is expected that fewer 'routine' medico-legal autopsies will be commanded, as the Coroner's Service and Death Certification procedures are changed and (hopefully) improved.

Gene products derived from the lytic phase appear to be important for angiogenesis and the inflammatory component of the disease. These include viral G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR, ORF 74), viral macrophage inhibitory protein II (vMIP-II, ORF K6), vK1 (ORF K1), viral interferon regulatory factor-1 (vIRF-1, ORF K9) and surface glycoprotein B (gB, ORFK8.1). The angiogenic phenotype initiated by the receptor vGPCR is mediated via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 14 , an angiogenesis and Kaposi's-spindle-cell growth factor and is a paracrine effect. Interferon is prevented from repressing the c-myc oncogene by vIRF 15 .",

These are early first steps in a journey, which will require that solutions to numerous questions be found before the enigma of Kaposi's sarcoma is resolved. 3 It appears that HIV infection is spreading through all strata of Indian society and all parts of the country including urban, rural and tribal areas [4] [5] [6] The predominant route of HIV transmission in Indian patients is through sexual contact. Although there is high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, only few reports on pathologic aspects of AIDS are described in Indian literature. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] The spectrum of pathologic lesions observed in one of the largest autopsy study in patients with AIDS from Mumbai demonstrated high frequency of secondary infections. 22 The spectrum of diseases identified in this report were: tuberculosis 95(59%), bacterial pneumonia 25(15%), CMV infection 25(15%), toxoplasmosis 15(9%), cryptococcosis 12(7%), pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 8(5%), candidiasis 6(4%), cryptosporidiosis 5(3%), aspergillosis 4(2%), strongyloides stercoralis 3(2%). AIDS associated tumors were identified in 4 cases which comprised of lymphoma in 3(2%) cases and Kaposi's sarcoma in 1(1%) case. This study shows both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis in 77/95(48%) cases while 18/95(11%) cases showed isolated pulmonary tuberculosis. High prevalence of tuberculosis is also observed in HIV infected patients from South India 16 . The overall high prevalence of tuberculosis in Indian patients suggests that physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease in AIDS patients. In our geographical setting, tuberculosis is most likely caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis species. A recent study from Mumbai in 24 patients with AIDS in whom diagnosis of tuberculosis was suspected, showed growth of mycobacterium tuberculosis on blood culture in all 24 patients, demonstrating importance of blood culture in confirming diagnosis of tuberculosis. 23 PCP remains the most common AIDS associated infection in developed countries, however Indian studies show 5%-14% prevalence of PCP. 16, 20, 22 There are no reports of extrapulmonary PCP in Indian literature.",

            "text": "Although not reported in adult population from India in the pre-AIDS era, toxoplasmosis was the most frequently observed CNS opportunistic infection identified in 9%-20% of HIV infected patients. 19, 22 The temporal trends observed in the prevalence of toxoplasmosis emphasise the importance of autopsy studies in not only documenting such a change, but also in increasing the awareness for such hitherto unsuspected lesions. Co-existent toxoplasmosis and acanthamoeba of brain is also described in Indian patients. 19 There are no reports of HIV associated encephalopathy and primary CNS lymphoma. 15 Few reports of spectrum of hepatic diseases in patients with AIDS are described in Indian literature. [24] [25] [26] The hepatic abnormalities associated with AIDS are predominantly secondary infections and tuberculosis of liver is most frequently identified infection in 41% patients. 26 Liver abscesses due to tubercle bacilli are an unusual manifestation of the natural history of tuberculous infection. There are few reports of tuberculous abscesses in patients with AIDS. [24] [25] [26] Pathology of kidney observed in these patients predominantly showed infectious diseases. 9 Reports of HIV associated nephropathy are not described in Indian literature. The heart is frequently affected in patients with AIDS, however most of the clinical events are subtle. Cardiac lesions described in patients with AIDS show high prevalence of infectious diseases of the heart. 10 Occasional report of cardiac toxoplasmosis is also documented in Indian literature. 10 The spectrum of gastrointestinal lesions associated with AIDS in Indian patients show cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidium, strongyloides strecoralis, hookworm, candidiasis, cryptococcosis and tuberculosis. The prevalence of Isospora belli is identified in 13% of patients with AIDS presenting with chronic diarrhoea. 14 There are no reports of microsporidiosis in Indian literature. 13 Skin lesions are most common site of AIDS diagnostic diseases in our patients. Inflammatory diseases are described in 38%-53% of our patient population. 7, 17, 27 Report of disseminated infection caused by penicillium marneffei is documented from the Manipur state of India. 28 Squamous cell carcinoma of penis is identified in 5% of young adults with AIDS. 7 Occasional reports of Kaposi's sarcoma are described in Indian literature, 17,21 however there is a strikingly low incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in our patients. Although accurate estimates of HIV/AIDS in children in India are not available, few reports on pathology of AIDS in children are descried. 29, 30 In summary, the reports on pathology of HIV/AIDS in India underline the overwhelming prevalence of tuberculosis, PCP remains less common in our patients. It appears that major laboratory efforts be directed to identifying infectious agents.",
