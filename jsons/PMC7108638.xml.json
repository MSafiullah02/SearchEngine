The CD E. coli were isolated from 7 CD patients (2 were receiving corticosteroids and azathioprine, respectively, and the remainder were on 5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA]); UC E. coli were isolated from 5 patients (all 5 on 5-ASA and 2 were receiving corticosteroids); control E. coli were isolated from 2 patients (IBS and sporadic polyps), and colon cancer E. coli were isolated from 11 patients (2 patients undergoing resection received intravenous cephalosporin and metronidazole). The phylogenetic group of each E. coli (A, B1, B2, or D) was defined by triplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously.16 The characteristics of the bacterial strains used in this study are summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "The flagellin receptor, TLR5, is largely expressed on the basolateral aspect of intestinal epithelial cells,43 so this raises the question of how this receptor will be accessed by the mucosal E. coli without cellular invasion. Although there is some evidence from human colonic epithelium44 and murine ileal epithelium42 of low-level expression of TLR5 on the apical surface, the healthy colonic epithelium is probably not responsive to luminal flagellar stimulation.45 This situation changes in the presence of inflammation, however. Mice cotreated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and flagellin develop a much more florid colitis than those treated with DSS alone, implying that flagellin plays an important role in the development and progression of colitis once the mucosal barrier is impaired.45 Thus, the impaired barrier that probably exists as a result of altered tight junction structure and function in UC46 and CD47 is likely to be sufficient for flagellin to access basolateral TLR5 in vivo. The weakened mucus barrier in ulcerative colitis would be an additional factor.48",

It has been shown that p38 MAPK, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 are activated in the inflamed colonic mucosa of IBD patients, with the p38\u03b1 isoform exhibiting the greatest increase in phosphorylation.52 There is preliminary evidence that MAPK inhibitors may be therapeutically effective in IBD.53",

They act locally at the mucosal level and efficacy is related to mucosal concentrations of the drug.54 In vitro effects of 5-ASA include inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis,55 proinflammatory cytokine production, and inhibition of both ERK and NF-\u03baB pathways.33 The antiinflammatory effect of 5-ASA has also been shown to be dependent on its interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.34 Some of these effects are complementary; inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, for example, will result in reduced phosphorylation and hence reduced degradation of PPAR\u03b3.56 Here, we demonstrate that clinically and biologically relevant concentrations of 5-ASA inhibit the IL-8 release triggered by mucosal E. coli isolates. In contrast to 5-ASA, hydrocortisone was only able to abolish epithelial IL-8 release at 20-fold higher concentrations than are relevant clinically. This is consistent with reports that hydrocortisone only reduces cytokine levels at supratherapeutic concentrations in the respiratory epithelium in response to coronoviral infection.57 Thus, the epithelial cell is the main target cell for 5-ASA therapy, whereas hydrocortisone exerts its effect mainly by acting on other cells such as T cells,58 monocytes,59 macrophages,60 and dendritic cells.61 It is also consistent with the fact that inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation, which is a principal target for corticosteroids, only had a minor effect on epithelial IL-8 response to mucosal E. coli in the current study.",
