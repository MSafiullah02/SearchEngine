To date, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected at least 100,000 individuals worldwide, reaching thousands of mortalities (1, 2) . In the Philippines, the number of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases is over 636 and is expected to rise. (8) Respiratory infections alongside their comorbidities can induce acute myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke. (3) These may further bring challenges in the management and administration of Intravenous (IV) Alteplase in eligible patients. Currently, there are no case reports in the administration IV Altepase in ischemic stroke patients who are COVID-19 positive. We present a case of a 62-year old female who was admitted due to cough, colds and shortness of breath of 2 weeks duration and was tested to be COVD-19 positive. She suffered from an ischemic stroke while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was given Intravenous thrombolysis.",

She was initially managed as a case of Community Acquired Pneumonia, but was tagged as a Person Under Investigation (PUI) due to her occupation as a health provider. She was admitted in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, (converted to the hospital's COVID Critical Unit) with necessary precautions undertaken. During the first hospital day, she developed sudden onset of severe dysarthria and right upper and lower extremity weakness, giving a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 4. Plain cranial CT scan showed a subtle hypodensity in the left centrum semiovale and corona radiata (Fig 1a) . CT-angiography showed significant stenosis in the left M1 segment of the Middle Cerebral Artery (Fig 1b) . Intravenous thrombolysis (IV rTPA) was initiated at a dose of 0.9mg/kg body weight 3.4 hours post ictus with 10% bolus of the total dose given initially, followed by the remaining dose as an infusion over 1 hour. Immediately after IV rTPA, the patient's right leg weakness resolved with an NIHSS of 3. Repeat plain cranial CT scan 24 hours post-IV rTPA showed absence of hemorrhage. Cautious hydration was made and Aspirin 100mg was started. However, on day 3 post ictus, his right leg was seen to be moving side to side with a cumulative NIHSS of 6. There were fluctuations in motor strength thereafter for which adjustment in IV hydration was made. She was confirmed COVID-19 positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) along with the classic findings on Highresolution CT (HRCT) of the chest showing areas of ground glass densities with focal areas of consolidation predominantly in both perihilar and peripheral regions of the lung (Fig 2) . The patient is being managed for the COVID-19 infection and is still admitted with mild dysarthria, right upper extremity falls before 10 seconds and right lower extremity drift (NIHSS of 4).",

(6, 7) Sars-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract by inducing release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)1\u03b2 and IL-6 by binding to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR), triggering an inflammatory cascade and resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Suppression of the inflammatory mediators have been shown to limit injury (12) . Increased inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, C-Reactive Protein and Fibrinogen) have been shown to increase stroke severity and disability within 30 days (13) , while erythrocyte sedimentation rate has not been shown to predict the outcome of stroke (14) . Chest imaging of COVID-19 patients show consolidation, ground glass opacities and bilateral lung involvement, which were consistent with findings in our patient. (1, 6, 7) Diagnostic parameters of COVID-19 patients show elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein which are seen in our patient (Table 1) To mention, myocarditis, the second common mentioned cause of fatality next to severe lung infection may exacerbate heart failure. Vice versa, acute heart failure should also be evaluated for myocarditis as a primary complication of COVID-19. (10) Whether this is secondary to viral infiltration, or hypoxia and cytokine storm mounting in response to systemic infection (15) , the aggressiveness in stroke management remains a priority because stroke is reversible.",

This is likely from extrinsic factors such as inadequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as well as lack of imaging modalities solely dedicated for COVID-19 patients to avoid rapid viral transmission. These occur on top of the already existing problem of shortage of healthcare professionals as they are inadvertently exposed and hence, quarantined. Multiple reports of cases will help explore other possibilities of a causal relationship or none, and define guidelines in the management of stroke among COVID-19 positive cases.",

Procalcitonin levels are normal unless there is a concomitant bacterial infection(1,6,7,13) .Currently, there are no reports elucidating the direct relationship of COVID-19 and its influence on stroke outcome. Possible mechanisms that may explain acute ischemic events in COVID-19 patients include cardiovascular compromise in the setting of infection, reduced oxygenation in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic inflammation causing thrombosis or plaque disruption. This patient had a coexisting cerebral vascular disease that may have an impact on the outcome of immediate treatment of stroke. Together with antithrombotics, the balance in hemodynamic status is paramount in treating such patients preand post-thrombolysis. Fluid management therefore remains a challenge among stroke patients who are COVID-19 positive as acute respiratory distress syndrome is a known potential sequelae, especially in those with multiple comorbidities. This reported case had severe stenosis in the left M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery which would make thrombolysis a better option as we anticipate the multisystemic problems that COVID patients are faced with.",
