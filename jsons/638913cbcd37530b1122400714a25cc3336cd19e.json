            "text": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a complex peptide cascade that has a prominent role in multiple important physiological processes such as vascular tone, vascular permeability, and myocardial remodeling. [1] [2] [3] The pharmacologic modulation of this system with agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBS) has resulted in major clinical benefits in the medical management of hypertension and heart failure. 3 Furthermore, the consequences of this pharmacologic blockade of the RAAS in perioperative cardiothoracic and vascular practice has been well-recognized, leading to the emergence of rescue therapies for support of vascular tone. [4] [5] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infects human cells such as alveolar endothelium in the lung by binding to the membrane receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). [1] [2] [3] Although the physiologic functions of ACE2 include counteracting the effects of RAAS activation, it also functions as a membrane receptor for the coronavirus. [1] [2] [3] This binding results in endocytosis of the viral complex with consequent local activation of the RAAS, resulting in acute lung injury that may progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome. 1-2 ; 6-7 The purpose of this freestanding editorial is to highlight the considerations concerning the RAAS in patients presenting with severe coronavirus disease 2019 . This perspective will focus on the clinical relevance of these considerations to inform the management of these challenging patients. [8] [9] [10] [11] The references provide further detail for healthcare teams as they manage the demands of the pandemic at their respective institutions. 3 The prevalence of coexisting hypertension has been estimated to be in the (10-25)% range amongst patients presenting with COVID-19. [11] [12] [13] [14] The coexisting conditions such as hypertension, older age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease have all been reported to be more common in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. [14] [15] [16] [17] The comorbidities, including hypertension, have also been significantly associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular compromise, and mortality. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Since the comorbidity of hypertension has been associated with severe COVID-19 and its consequences, the question has emerged about the roles of RAAS inhibitors such as ACEI and ARBS in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Given that these RAAS inhibitors are common therapies for hypertension and that they may up-regulate the expression of ACE2, the clinical concern has been formulated that therapy with these agents may increase the risk and severity of coronavirus infection. [19] [20] [21] [22] There is currently insufficient evidence to address this question in a definitive fashion. 1; 14 The published literature both in preclinical and clinical studies has conflicting results about the potential for harm with respect to the interactions between RAAS inhibitors and coronavirus 19. Further trials will likely focus on the current evidence gaps related to this question in severe COVID-19 including mechanisms, the prevalence of RAAS inhibitors, and careful correlation of this prevalence with clinical outcomes. 1; 18-19",

[23] [24] There may also be confounding by association here in that patients with severe COVID-19 are more likely to be 4 hypertensive, diabetic and older. This comorbidity burden rather than the associated drug therapy may better explain the adverse outcomes in coronavirus infection. [17] [18] [19] In contrast, animal studies have clearly documented that ACE2 may have a protective role in acute lung injury related to coronavirus infection. [25] [26] Functional ACE2 typically converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, thereby reducing the adverse effects of angiotensin II via the angiotensin type I receptor in the lung that lead to acute lung injury. 1; 21 Since therapy with ACEI and/ot ARBS also reduces angiotensin II levels, it follows that these agents may also protect against acute lung injury in the setting of COVID-19.

[13] [14] In summary, the expert consensus from all these professional societies is that patients with COVID-19 should continue their regular home blood antihypertensive regimen, even if it includes ACEI and ARBS. 14 In patients with COVID-19 who develop shock, the vasodilator regimen with RAAS inhibitors can be discontinued. 14 Although not specifically addressed in these multiple professional guidelines, the roles of rescue therapy for vasoplegic shock can also be considered in refractory cases, including angiotensin II. 2;4-5 Furthermore, in treatment-resistant cases of COPVID-19, the mechanisms for cardiogenic shock and the supportive roles of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be entertained early, as these considerations can often lead to therapeutic breakthroughs.

The exogenous administration of recombinant ACE2 may not only bind circulating coronavirus to acute viral load but also could degrade angiotensin II to down-regulate activation of the RAAS and protect against acute lung injury in COVID-19. 1; 22; 28 This fascinating dual function of ACE2 has prompted a pilot clinical trial to evaluate recombinant ACE2 in patients with COVID-19 (full details available at www.clinicaltrials.gov with trial identifier #NCT04287686, last accessed March 31 st 2020). The potential therapeutic effects of ARBS in COVID-19 have also triggered a set of clinical trials (full details available at www.clinicaltrials.gov with trial identifiers #NCT04312009 and #NCT04311177, last accessed March 31 st 2020). Furthermore, there are clinical trials in progress investigating the effects of ACEI in patients with COVID-19 (full details available at www.clinicaltrials.gov with trial identifiers #NCT04322786 and #NCT04318418, last accessed March 31 st 2020). These trials will likely provide much needed evidence to guide therapy with RAAS inhibitors in patients throughout the clinical spectrum of COVID-19.",
