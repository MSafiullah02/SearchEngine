Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) are typical in this regard. Although attention has focused on the group specific gene clusters 3abc and 7ab of FCoV in an attempt to discover factors that confer greater virulence to certain strains, the exact nature of the FIP inducing mutations are still unknown. 1, 2, 6, 7 To complicate matters further, the role of the immune system in protecting against disease in some animals, while contributing to the disease in others, is another poorly defined phenomenon in the pathogenesis of FIP. Cats with a competent immune system infected with less pathogenic strains of FIPV may avoid overt disease manifestations, however genetic susceptibility or the immunomodulating effects of stress or concurrent disease may allow the development of clinical disease with less virulent strains. 2 The clinical presentations of FIP are variable and often complex, reflecting variations in the virus and the nature of the host immune response. Approximately 50% of all cats diagnosed worldwide are less than 2-years-old and purebred cats are generally over represented. Two broad forms of the disease have been described across all ages and breeds: 'effusive' and 'non-effusive'. Despite this apparent division, these are not distinct disease entities. Cats with FIP may alternate between forms during the progression of disease. Furthermore, cats with non-effusive FIP may develop effusions in the terminal stages of disease, and conversely, there are reports of non-effusive FIP being preceded by a subtle effusive form. 8 Typically, patients with effusive FIP have high protein peritoneal and/or thoracic effusion(s), fever, weight loss, anaemia and elevated serum globulin levels, although not all cats adhere to this stereotype. The non-effusive form of FIP is often more vague in its presentation with nonspecific signs including fever, weight loss, malaise and inappetance. Clinical signs, beyond the non-specific, relate to the tissues affected. Possibilities include liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, abdominal lymph nodes, CNS, lung, GIT, eyes and heart.

Two of the affected Australian Mist cats were siblings but unfortunately the genetic relationships between affected cats within other breeds were not available. Further examination of the pedigree data from numerous generations of cats within these breeds is required to determine the nature of their susceptibility to FIP.

In a study of 488 cats with histopathologically confirmed FIP, 27 it was found that 80% of cats had effusive disease compared with 60% of cats in studies by Lutz and colleagues. 29 The current study had approximately equal numbers of cats with effusive (45%) and non-effusive (55%) disease. While it may be argued that this was the result of many of the cases being derived from a referral hospital, PCH (a predominantly primary accession hospital) had 60% non-effusive cases.

Of the 12 cats in which sonography was performed, five were determined to have pyogranulomatous inflammation in the aspirated organ, which is suggestive rather than pathognomic for FIP, while seven were non-diagnostic. The use of cytology to support a diagnosis of FIP, even with the addition of immunocytochemical detection of FCoV positive macrophages, has been a low yield procedure (S Paltrinieri, personal communication).

In the current study, despite histopathological evidence of neurological FIP at necropsy, only one of four cats fulfilled the above criteria, although all cats had nucleated cell counts considerably greater than 100 cells/\u03bcL. A neutrophilic pleocytosis was present in three of the four cats. Determining the antibody titre to FCoV in CSF compared to serum is still considered to be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of FIP, but was not performed in these cases. It is widely known that collection of CSF is certainly not a risk free procedure, as evidenced by one of the five cats dying as a result of cisternal CSF collection.

The antibody titre to FCoV in cats with FIP varies according to the nature of the clinical syndrome. There is considerable variation in the reported magnitude of anti FCoV antibody titres in cats with confirmed effusive or non-effusive FIP, with considerable overlap with healthy patients, making interpretation difficult. 35, 36 Indeed, a negative antibody titre alone cannot rule out a diagnosis of FIP, while a positive titre does not confirm a diagnosis of FIP.
