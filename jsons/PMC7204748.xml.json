A suitable solution able to evaluate only one variable, that in this case is PM10 concentration, is to select an indicator of PM10 pollution. In this case, for example it is possible to consider the number of days with PM10 concentrations overcoming the 50 \u03bcg/m3 limit. Due to almost similar temporal variability of PM10 in all the Lombardy and Piedmont cities, this indicator can be useful to highlight and compare the data, with the aim to understand if PM10 can play as a vector of the virus diffusion, the so-called \u201cairborne virus diffusion\u201d.",

However, a comparison between Figures 4a and 4b clearly shows the absence of any sort of correlation. Also changing the day chosen to compare the data (for example selecting the 28th of March 2020 to account the reported infection cases) Figure 4b results slightly modified, with changes that cannot be appreciated, in respect to the original.

In particular, considering for the Lombardy the infections cases reported on 5th of March 2020 and for the Piedmont those reported on 12th of March 2020 (a week later) it is possible to assist to an increase of the Torino contribution (187 cases), but still with high prevalence of Bergamo cases (537 cases).

Concerning Italy, some scientists believe that the virus circulated unnoticed in Italy from January.
