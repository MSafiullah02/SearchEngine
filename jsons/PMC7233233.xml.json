            "text": "A 33-year-old Polish truck driver who was passing through Leipzig, Germany, coming from Lombardy, northern Italy, a region where the first major SARS-CoV-2 outbreak occurred in Europe at that time [1], was found unwell at a local highway service area on February 29, 2020. The patient was immediately brought to our hospital as a suspect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case. On emergency admission, he was an extremely ill patient (heart rate: 130 bpm, BP: 70/40 mmHg, temperature: 39 \u00b0C, respiratory rate: 32 breaths/min). Besides tachypnea, the patient had no objective respiratory symptoms, but severe abdominal pain. CT scans showed small liquid streaks around the pancreas and the right kidney. There were no signs of pneumonitis, as well as no spleen. Lab values revealed leukopenia, elevated procalcitonin (160 \u00b5g/L), and C-reactive protein (380 mg/L), as well as severe lactate acidosis. We suspected an overwhelming post-splenectomy infection and started treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5 g QID), aggressive volume therapy, and catecholamines. Clinically, a rapidly developing sepsis-induced purpura fulminans (Fig. 1\nA and B) was observed. After almost 60 hours of incubation, blood cultures revealed Capnocytophaga canimorsus bacteremia (Fig. 1C). In retrospect, the patient always had his dog with him in the truck cab and was regularly licked in the face. The patient recovered completely after 8 weeks and was discharged from the hospital in good general condition.",

Transmission to humans may occur through bites, licks or even close proximity with animals [2]. In case of invasive disease, Capnocytophaga can reproduce largely undetected due to resistance to macrophages and other immune escape phenomena, particularly post-splenectomy, which contributes to its high pathogenicity [[3], [4]].",
