Respiratory viral infections are typically caused by rhinovirus (RhVs), coronavirus (CoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (FLU), parainfluenza (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and adenovirus (AdV) ( Table 9 .1). Respiratory infections can also be caused by viruses less commonly associated with the respiratory tract such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesviruses (HSV1, HSV2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) that will be discussed in another chapter (Chap. 6) . A detailed discussion of other newer respiratory viruses (Table 9 .1) is beyond the scope of this chapter, since they have not been widely studied in immunocompromised patients and their clinical impact is not fully understood. However, these viruses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with severe lower tract disease, especially if clinical history indicates potential exposure. The newer RVs are more challenging to diagnose since they are not included in the routinely available diagnostic tests and optimal management has not been defined.

A lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is defined as new onset of shortness of breath, cough, sputum, rales, hypoxemia, and/or wheezing. When symptoms of LRTI are associated with a new pulmonary infiltrate (on chest radiograph or chest computed tomography), pneumonia is distinguished from tracheobronchitis. Many common respiratory viral infections in SOT patients are mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and do not require hospitalization. However, compared to immunocompetent hosts and due to alterations in cellular and humoral immunity, infections can cause protracted symptoms with greater risk of progression to LRTI, prolonged periods of viral shedding, and increased mortality. In SOT, LRTIs have been associated with increased risk of adverse complications and subsequent development of fungal, viral, and bacterial superinfections [2] . Although these complications may appear in the context of any type of transplantation, pediatric, lung, and heart-lung transplantation recipients appear to have the greatest risk of respiratory viral infections with more severe courses and complications [2] [3] [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 183, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1173, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1433, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1437, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1441, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Manifestations"}, {"text": "In addition to their direct, cytopathic, and tissue-invasive effects, RVs can create an inflammatory environment that leads to local and systemic microbially determined immune modulation (MDIM) [5] .

Fever can be absent in SOT with pneumonia or can be the sole presenting sign. In addition bacterial and fungal coinfections may occur. The distribution of RV infections throughout the year suggests that seasonal patterns of RV circulation in SOT are similar to those circulating in the general [2, 3] . Consequently, vigilance regarding circulating community RV infections is required while caring for SOT recipients. Rapid and reliable laboratory diagnosis is required in SOT with respiratory syndrome to significantly impact on patient care and management. The ideal method of sampling has also come into question, as the yield of viral specimen may differ depending on the specimen source. All SOTs with suspected RV infection should have a nasopharyngeal sample tested by PCR, including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), wash, or aspirate. Between common respiratory specimens collected from the upper respiratory tract, NPS are preferred, since they are practical for widespread use and comparable in sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the detection of all major RVs [1, 7, 8] .

Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the assay performed (https://www.cdc.gov/urdo/downloads/speccollectionguidelines. pdf). Of note that regarding ADV, negative testing from the upper or lower airway may not exclude infections particularly for SOT with disseminated disease if there is limited to no involvement of the respiratory tract.

A number of commercial IA are available for RSV and FLU (A and B) and require little technical expertise. However, false-negative and false-positive results can be generated. A low prevalence of circulating virus within the community decreases the positive predictive value of the test.

Limited understanding of (1) risk factors for progression to severe LRTI and poor outcomes and (2) indirect inflammatory effects of viral infection impact opinions on appropriate interventions for respiratory viral infections. RV infections, particularly cause by influenza virus, are a risk factor for subsequent bacterial and fungal superinfections. In cases of LRTI, secondary infections must be ruled out and appropriately treated, and initiation of oral or nebulized antifungal prophylaxis to prevent invasive fungal infections should be evaluated in high-risk patients [1, 2, 12] . Management in transplant patients is generally focused on reduction of immunosuppression feasible to speed resolution of viral infection. Treatment options for RVs are limited (Tables 9.2 and 9.4). Resistance patterns may change and affect recommended antiviral strategies. Consequently, clinicians should consult national health authority regularly for updated recommendations, especially for influenza.

SOT \u2022 In addition to their direct, cytopathic, and tissue-invasive effects, RVs can create a microbially determined immune modulation The impact of RVs in acute and chronic rejection remains controversial, with the greatest risk in lung transplant recipients \u2022 Pediatric solid organ, lung transplant, and heart-lung transplantation recipients appear to have the greatest risk of both RVs infections and more severe complications \u2022 Rhinovirus and coronaviruses are the most common etiological agents \u2022 Influenza and other paramyxovirus (RSV, PIV, and hMPV) have a greater propensity to produce LRTID Diagnosis \u2022 Diligent collection of respiratory specimens and knowledge of the limitations of the assay used by your laboratory are essential for interpreting the results \u2022 Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are preferred for the detection of all major RVs \u2022 Bronchoalveolar lavage is the preferred specimen for diagnostic testing in LRTID with negative NPS \u2022 Laboratory diagnostic methods include virus culture, rapid antigen detection tests, the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other nucleic acid amplification assays, and serology \u2022 Nucleic acid amplification tests, mainly RT-PCR, are the best diagnostic tools for studying RVs in SOT Treatment \u2022 Treatment options remain limited and consist of supportive care, reduction of immunosuppression and, if available, antiviral therapy \u2022 The use of immunomodulatory agents (intravenous immunoglobulin, monoclonal antibodies, RV-specific T lymphocytes or augmented corticosteroid therapy) is a clinical dilemma \u2022 SOT should receive antiviral therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI, either oseltamivir or zanamivir) when influenza is suspected, before laboratory confirmation \u2022 Treatment of influenza with M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) is not recommended for high resistance rates \u2022 Treatment for influenza with NAI should be initiated as soon as possible (<48 h) for optimal benefit, however and all symptomatic patients should receive antiviral therapy, irrespective of symptom onset \u2022 Duration of therapy should be minimum of 5 days, but longer duration of therapy (\u226510 days) may be required in critically ill patients \u2022 Double dosing of oseltamivir is not recommended but may be considered in severe cases or in case of insufficient response to therapy \u2022 The use of intravenous zanamivir or peramivir can be considered in patients not responding to oseltamivir therapy or for whom oral absorption is a concern \u2022 In case of high-level oseltamivir resistance, zanamivir is usually active \u2022 The efficacy of ribavirin (aerosolized, intravenous, or oral) for the treatment of RSV infection in SOT recipients has not been determined \u2022 In severe cases of LRTIs with RSV, PIV, and hMPV infections in SOT recipients, therapy with ribavirin (aerosolized, intravenous, or oral) may
