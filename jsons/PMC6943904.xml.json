During the past decades, the diagnosis of HF has been mainly based on echocardiography including dilation of left ventricular (LV) and cardiac dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, < 40%). Regardless of the etiology, it has shown that the underlying mechanisms contributing to the progression of HF can lead to stereotypical changes in gene expression [4]. Therefore, investigation of transcriptional profiles and related changes may gain new insights into its molecular mechanisms, helping us develop better diagnostic and prognostic strategies.",

            "text": "Cardiac fibrosis is a requisite component that underlies nearly all forms of HF. With the advent of anti-fibrotic pharmacologic therapies, fibrosis has become an important therapeutic target in HF patients [5]. Moreover, fibrosis disrupts the myocardial architecture, thereby predisposing the progression of cardiac diseases to HF [6]. To our knowledge, there have been limited studies reporting the role of specific fibrosis genes in HF progression which can be used as biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis. Recent advances in transcriptional profiling allow us to not only investigate the mRNA level, but also non-coding RNA including microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Studies have reported that several mRNAs (e.g., CORIN, CTGF, and POSTIN), miRNAs (e.g., miR-1, miR-133 and miR-423-5p), and lnRNAs (e.g., H19 and HOTAIR) might play roles in the pathogenic mechanisms leading to HF [7\u201311]. Although these studies have reported many promising findings, a systematic investigation of multiple types of expression and their regulation in HF will likely reveal more dynamic and regulatory signatures related to fibrosis in HF, thus helping us better understand the development and progression of HF.",

Our functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed significant pathways, including extracellular matrix (ECM) that might play important roles in HF. By constructing the dysfunctional regulatory networks, several miRNAs (e.g., miR-129-5p and miR-190-5p) and lncRNAs (e.g., BANCR and PDZRN3-AS1) were pinpointed to be critical in HF. Using a lasso regression method, several genes, especially ECM-related genes, were identified to contribute to fibrosis, a main feature of HF. In particular, an upregulation of COL1A1 in HF, which was regulated by miRNA miR-190-5p and lncRNA MSTRG.16534 in our regulatory network, was found to be related to fibrosis. Interestingly, the COL1A1 content in plasma was found to contribute to the progression of HF, suggesting that it might be a potential plasma biomarker to predict the heart transplantation (HTx) within 1 year from HF onset. These findings suggested the possible roles of ECM, in particular via a COL1A1 regulatory module, in the progression of HF. The flowchart of our study is illustrated in Fig. 1.\n",

First, ribosomal RNA was removed by Epicentre Ribo-zero\u2122 rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre, USA), and rRNA-free residue was cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. Next, sequencing libraries were generated using the rRNA-depleted RNA by NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Briefly, fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNaseH\u2212). Second-strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. In the reaction buffer, dNTPs with dTTP were replaced by dUTP. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3\u2032 end of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure was ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150~200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then, 3 \u03bcl USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95 \u00b0C before PCR. PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers, and Index (X) Primer. Finally, the products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext\u00ae Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina\u00ae (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation, and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, NEB 3\u2032 SR Adaptor was directly and specifically ligated to 3\u2032 end of miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA. After the 3\u2032 ligation reaction, the SR RT Primer hybridized to the excess of 3\u2032 SR Adaptor (that remained free after the 3\u2032 ligation reaction) and transformed the single-stranded DNA adaptor into a double-stranded DNA molecule. This step is important to prevent adaptor-dimer formation. In addition, dsDNAs were not substrates for ligation mediated by T4 RNA Ligase 1 and therefore did not ligate to the 5\u2032 SR Adaptor in the subsequent ligation step. 5\u2032 end adapter was ligated to 5\u2032 end of miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA. Then first-strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H\u2212). PCR amplification was performed using LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix, SR Primer for Illumina and index (X) primer. PCR products were purified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (100 V, 80 min). DNA fragments corresponding to 140~160 bp (the length of small non-coding RNA plus the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 adaptors) were recovered and dissolved in 8 \u03bcl elution buffer. Finally, library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system using DNA High Sensitivity Chips. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

The known mature miRNA expression profile was generated by using the quantifier module of the miRDeep2 package that gives the read counts for the known miRNAs. Specifically, 479.49 million reads (78.70%) were mapped to mature human miRNAs. For the pre-processing of miRNA data, we removed miRNAs with a missing value in > 10% of the samples. According to the miRNA sequence database miRBase [20] (Release 22), there were 2620 mature human miRNAs. Our analysis resulted in 604 expressed miRNAs in our samples.",

In this network, a node represents a gene or a term while an edge indicates that a gene belongs to a term. To investigate the functions of the DElncs, we identified their potential targets based on the FEELnc tool with default parameter since classifying lncRNAs with mRNAs could help predict the functions of lncRNAs [17].

Interestingly, lncRNA expression profiles had the best performance in distinguishing HF from healthy controls, reinforcing the importance to further investigate their underlying mechanism in HF. In Fig. 3d\u2013f, volcano plots showed downregulated (blue nodes) and upregulated (red nodes) genes. We identified 126 mRNAs, 16 lncRNAs, and 42 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in HF versus control samples by requiring the absolute log2-transformed fold change (FC) > 1 and adjusted p value < 0.05 by the BH method. Furthermore, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the expression profiles for the differentially expressed mRNAs revealed a distinct expression signature of HF compared to healthy samples as shown in Fig. 3g\u2013i. It is suggested that HF samples had distinct transcriptomic changes at multiple molecular levels when compared to control samples.\n\n",

Among the significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process (BP) pathways, some fibrosis-related terms stood out, such as extracellular matrix (GO:0031012) (BH adjusted p value = 1.55 \u00d7 10\u2212 15) and regulation of blood pressure (BH adjusted p value = 4.10 \u00d7 10\u2212 7) [33, 34]. To better interpret the results, we constructed a DEG GO term network (Fig. 4b). From this network, it would be interesting to see those genes associated with multiple terms, especially multiple categories defined by GO terms in a parent-child relationship. In our network, the gene POSTN was involved in 17 terms (degree = 17) in five categories. POSTN is critical in cardiac development and remodeling, and the expression was found to be consistent with the percentage of myocardial fibrosis [35]. Hence, genes with a high degree in this network might provide promising candidates for further investigation, such as ACE2, KLF4, JAK2, and NR4A3.\n",

This is consistent with the observation that the expression of COL1A1 was positively correlated with fibrosis and the patients with a high COL1A1 expression needed HTx in a much shorter period than those with a low COL1A1 expression. These results further implied that COL1A1 represents a fibrosis signature and is associated with HF progression. Due to the relatively small number of samples, this finding warrants further validation.",

Our results revealed that COL1A1 was potentially associated with fibrosis and might be a novel biomarker for HF progression. To further validate results mentioned above, we performed the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining assay of the left ventricles in the analysis cohort. Among our 30 samples, only 21 HF samples and 6 normal samples could be further used for the IHC staining assay (Fig. 7a). Based on the quantitative analysis of COL1A1-positive area in the whole slice prepared by Imge-Pro Plus, we found that the proportion of COL1A1-positive area in HF was much larger than normal control (13.61 \u00b1 2.55% vs. 3.76 \u00b1 0.64%, t-test p value = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u2212 3, Fig. 7b). To further validate the expression of COL1A1 as a marker in HF versus normal controls, we performed the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay of the COL1A1 gene expression in an independent cohort including 20 HF samples and 9 normal controls. As shown in Fig. 7c, the relative expression of COL1A1 showed significantly higher expression in HF samples than normal controls (4.07 \u00b1 0.48 vs. 1.13 \u00b1 0.22, t-test p value = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u2212 4).

Furthermore, we used this dataset as gold standard. After obtaining the plasma COL1A1 content, we can define a plasma COL1A1 content threshold for the patients being transplanted within 1 year versus longer than 1 year. In addition, the diagnostic efficiency of plasma COL1A1 expression level for survival from HF onset to HTx was also calculated.

Although it is preliminary, this observation might motivate us to find potential lncRNA biomarkers for diagnose and prognosis of HF in future.

In addition, we identified several novel fibrosis associated genes for further validation, such as NR4A3, PTGDS, TNC, miR-190a, and miR-708-5p. For example, a previous study reported that PTGDS could mediate biosynthesis of PGD2 to promote cardiomyocyte survival [49].

Furthermore, our network analysis revealed that microRNA: mir-129-5p and lncRNA: LOC101927179 might regulate the expression of PTGDS in the same network, which was associated with fibrosis (Fig. 6c) and the survival rate (Additional file 7: Table S7).

Although transcriptomic approaches have been applied to identify genes involved in the fibrotic process in previous studies, the specific fibrosis-related genes in HF development and further contributed to the HF progression is still not well known. With the survival rate and gene expression data in this study, we identified a fibrosis-associated gene, COL1A1, that was significantly associated with HF progression. By performing IHC and qRT-PCR experiments, the expression of COL1A1 was validated to be highly upregulated in the HF samples. We were able to further investigate COL1A1 content in plasma by using another 139 HF samples. And we found that higher expression level of COL1A1 in plasma was associated with poor survival from HF to HTx (Fig. 7e). To our knowledge, this is the first report to specify fibrotic gene associated with HF progression. It is known that HF is heterogeneous with different time from HF onset to HTx ranging from 30 days to more than 5 years [50]. The plasma biomarkers might provide great promise to further dissect the underlying disease processes. Our results indicated that the plasma COL1A1 content could be a potential biomarker to distinguish the malignant process of HF within 1-year after HF diagnosis with higher diagnostic efficiency than longer survival condition (Additional file 8: Table S8). It will be helpful to assess the HF patient regarding longer survival, as well as to alleviate the overload of HF. It is important to further study the mechanistic role of COL1A1 in fibrosis. There are some reports of the association between COL1A1 and fibrosis in HF based on the mouse model or in other diseases such as liver cancer [51\u201353]. In the present work, we validated this relationship at the transcriptomic level in the human heart tissue. Instead of further investigating how COL1A1 leads to fibrosis, we focused on the potential role of COL1A1 in HF progression. Such finding is much needed for clinical studies in heart transplantation.",

Our top gene (COL1A1) identified in the 30 discovery cohort samples was further validated by immunohistochemistry staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors), and an additional 139 cohort patients for evaluation of plasma COL1A1 content. This size of the heart failure cohort for potential biomarker discovery is smaller than some of the previous studies of HF [54, 55]. It is due to the fact that all the HF patients, including the 139 HF cohort, received heart transplantation, which is different from the previous studies [55]. Considering this limitation, our findings need further validation by recruiting more HF patients with related clinical data and additional functional work to illustrate specific roles of plasma COL1A1 level on HF progression in the future. Furthermore, most HF patients included in the study for multi-transcriptomic analysis were young (mean age 34.6), and much younger than the general patient population. Our preliminary analysis did not find any significant difference by checking family history and etiology of these HF patients. Since most HF patients are older than our samples, the results in this study might include some unique features of this specific population and further investigation is warranted in future. Moreover, we found that there were two HFpEF samples in our study cohort.
