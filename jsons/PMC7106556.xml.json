            "text": "Since the recognition of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, several new viruses have emerged in different parts of the world. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012, with several cases documented in European travellers who had visited the Middle East. More than 840 human cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed as of July, 2014. Most patients had respiratory disease with a range of clinical manifestations from mild, asymptomatic cases to severe multisystem illness; mortality was about 38%. Human adenovirus 14 (HAdV14) was first recognised in 1955 and it re-emerged in 2006 in the USA in a slightly different form (HAdV-14p1). Outbreaks have been restricted to the USA and China, with cases totalling in the hundreds, and mortality has been low. Influenza A H7N9 virus emerged in eastern China in early 2013 with very few cases occurring outside of China. As of June, 2014, more than 448 confirmed human cases have been documented with an estimated 39% mortality rate. Avian influenza A H10N8, the first strain of which was isolated from birds several decades ago, emerged in 2013 to infect at least three people in China, leading to one death. Similarly, in 2011 a novel swine-like influenza H3N2 variant virus emerged in two states in the USA, causing disease in 12 people. By the end of 2013, the virus had spread to ten states and caused at least 340 people to be ill (with one death). In this paper, we review the epidemiology of these emerging viruses, including their geographical distribution, modes of transmission, and where appropriate their zoonotic characteristics.",

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), cases have been reported in Algeria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Philippines, Tunisia, the UK, and the USA.

The absence of clinical signs among influenza A H3N2 variant infected pigs is a major concern in that people are essentially serving as sentinels of infection.\u2022First identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, the number of human cases of MERS-CoV infection have steadily increased to more than 840. Nosocomial transmission to patients and health-care workers has been documented.\u2022While geographically restricted to the Middle East, MERS-CoV is of major public health concern since millions of pilgrims from 184 countries visit Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage throughout the year.\u2022There is a mounting evidence suggesting that camels are the likely reservoir of MERS-CoV human infections although the precise mode of transmission to humans remains unknown.\u2022A united and coordinated global response is needed to tackle new infectious diseases threats posed by novel viruses that can cause fatal respiratory tract infections over the past decade and to fill major gaps that remain in the understanding of their epidemiology and transmission dynamics.\n\n",

The Hajj draws 2\u20133 million pilgrims from within Saudi Arabia and around the world. Worldwide attention has focused on the potential spread of MERS-CoV after the Hajj pilgrimage because pilgrims have a high risk of respiratory tract infections because of crowded conditions.4 In 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Health recommended that elderly people (older than 65 years), people with chronic diseases (eg, heart disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes), the immunocompromised (congenital and acquired), people with malignant disease or terminal illnesses, pregnant women, and children (age less than 12 years) postpone their participation in the Hajj and Umrah for their own safety.5 Investigations done among French pilgrims participating in the 2013 Hajj showed that 48% had at least one disorder for which the Saudi Ministry of Health recommends participation in the Hajj be postponed.6, 7 None of 179 individuals at risk decided to cancel participation, even after receiving this advice during consultation.6, 7 All countries (particularly those with returning pilgrims) were advised by the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee to strengthen their surveillance capacities and ensure robust reporting of any identified cases.8 Cohort surveys of returning French pilgrims with systematic screening of MERS-CoV nasal carriage by PCR were done in 2012 and 2013, and the results were negative despite high rates of respiratory symptoms.9, 10 However, pilgrims rapidly acquired other respiratory viruses during their stay in Saudi Arabia (especially rhinovirus and influenza viruses, which emphasises the potential of these infections to spread in the pilgrims' home countries on their return.10, 11 Screening of pilgrims from 22 countries before (3210 pilgrims) and after (2025) Hajj in 2013 did not reveal any positive cases by RT-PCR.12\n",

Among 144 confirmed and 17 probable cases analysed by the MERS-CoV Research Group in November, 2013, 95 (59%) were classified as secondary cases with epidemiological links to other confirmed cases. Among these, most acquired the infection in health-care settings (63\u00b72%), followed by those infected in household settings (13\u00b77%).13 In the same report, clusters of cases secondary to human-to-human transmission occurred with a cluster size ranging from two to 25 patients. The largest cluster was in Al-Hasa (Saudi Arabia) with 25 cases among patients undergoing hemodialysis, visiting family members, and health-care workers.14 However, a description of the geographical distribution and phylogenetic relation of MERS-CoV infections across time suggests that the Al-Hasa hospital outbreak might have been caused by more than one virus introduction.15 Other clusters in the health-care setting have been described in France, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE.13 Several clusters have been described in the context of the household setting in Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, or in both the contexts of health-care and household settings in the UK.13, 16, 17 Transmission in all reported clusters is restricted, and evidence from contact-tracing suggests that transmission did not extend beyond close contacts into the community. Assessment of the between-human transmissibility of MERS-CoV by two teams with available non-hospital epidemiological data confirmed the restricted pattern of transmission. The estimated R0 was 0\u00b760\u20130\u00b769 in one study and 0\u00b78\u20131\u00b73 in another (table 1\n).18, 19 In the absence of appropriate hospital infection control, R0 might be greater than 1 in hospitals admitting patients with MERS-CoV.",

Contact of patients with camels was documented in only five of 51 cases; however, reliable information was available from only 28 cases.13 MERS-CoV spike-protein-binding antibodies and virus neutralising antibodies are reported in high proportions of camels from the Canary Islands, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, but not from other livestock including sheep, goats, cattle, and chickens.30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 A higher seroprevalence was reported in adults than in juvenile camels.33, 36 Furthermore, MERS-CoV was detected by quantitative (q) RT-PCR from nasal samples in 11 of 14 camels from a farm in Qatar linked to two confirmed human cases, five of 76 camels from Oman, 36 of 104 juvenile camels from Saudi Arabia, 15 of 98 adult camels from Saudi Arabia, and four of 110 camels from Egypt, two of which were imported from Sudan and Ethiopia.31, 33, 38, 39 Genomic sequences of MERS-CoV isolates from two patients and from their infected camels were almost identical, suggesting camel-to-human transmission.40, 41\n",

There is a mounting evidence suggesting that camels are the likely reservoir of human exposure to MERS-CoV. Influenza A H7N9 and influenza A H10N8 reservoirs consist of poultry, ducks, and wild birds. The influenza A H3N2 reservoir consists of pigs. One possible way to prevent these zoonotic infections is avoiding direct contact with these animals or their dairy products in the respective areas of endemicity. It is advisable avoiding staying in environments where such animals are concentrated, including farms and markets. The absence of massive deaths and even of clinical signs among the reservoir animals leaves little or no time for public health preparations and intervention measures to curtail the impacts by culling. Given the possible interhuman transmission of these viruses (notably MERS-Cov and HAdV-14p1), the individual preventive measures aiming at reducing the risk of respiratory infections (use of face-mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing) should be reinforced.",
