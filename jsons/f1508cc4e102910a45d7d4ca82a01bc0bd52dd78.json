For the same reason the strategy adopted globally has been to 'flatten the curve' in order to avoid the overburdening of the healthcare system and preventing its collapse (7) . This has been implemented in the form of social distancing and lockdowns. In such dire situations the key is not only to treat the infected but equally essential is to ensure Healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the care of the patients have a safe working environment. Protection of HCPs is of prime importance because of the risk of infecting other members of the team, patients (8) , and indeed family members. Currently 5.7% of the NHS workforce is off sick or in self-isolation (9) with resultant workforce depletion; of more concern is the number HCPs deaths (10) , with ethnicity recently questioned as a risk factor. Preventing the spread of infection among the medical personals and then to the patients depends upon the appropriate training and use of the personal protective equipment (PPE) -facemasks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns and aprons. Due to the imbalance between the demand and supply, a critical shortage of PPE is expected even in the most developed countries.",

Respondents were asked five questions regarding their trust preparation for the pandemic: whether they felt supported at their trust, availability of adequate facilities (specialist beds, specified isolated areas) to treat COVID-19 patients, availability of enough PPE, whether there was enough local guidance regarding the pandemic and if sufficient local training was provided. Further two questions were related to their daily source of information regarding this pandemic and if it has improved their hand washing practice. Three general questions regarding their views of the pandemic included Britain's preparedness for this pandemic, timing of the lockdown and testing of the frontline NHS staff were asked.

The daily media briefing emphasises that millions of pieces of PPE are being made available to health workers in the UK. This is in line with the Health & Safety Executive's directive on PPE, including the employer's duty in the provision and use of these (19) . The emphasis here is of course on the risk of contamination from air-borne pathogens (20). Currently this consists of guidelines stratified according to the level of exposure with the maximal protection level consisting of full body coverage and wearing of N95 respirator (e.g. FFP3) masks. The key regulations (Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992) (21) surrounding the use of PPE in this crisis hinge on (i) proper assessment to assess fitness for purpose (ii) provision of instructions on safe use (iii) ensuring correct usage by employees. There has been a lot of concern regarding the availability of adequate PPE for the frontline staff (12). Guidance in itself offers no protection till the resources are available for implementation of such guidelines and adequate training provided. Two-third of the respondents in our survey did not think that adequate PPE was available while approximately 50% did not receive adequate local training. A survey (snapshot over 24 hrs) carried out by the Royal College of Physicians (22) in the first week of April revealed 78% respondents could access PPE. A similar survey by the Royal College of Surgeons (23) in the second week of April demonstrated that a third of the surgeons and trainees did not believe that they have adequate PPE supply and about 57% thought that there have been shortages of PPE in the last 30 days preceding the survey.",

Trainees have been asked to not undertake activities beyond their competence, with an overview maintained by the relevant postgraduate dean (24), though there is a recognition that there will be an increasing need for trainees to support local healthcare systems. It would not be unreasonable to consider that it is not within the GMC's remit to advise on PPE, but they are engaged with the national directives, having produced an advisory webpage in this respect, dealing with doctors' wellbeing, protection in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, and maintaining standards of practice during the pandemic (25).",

Another report published on 16 March 2020 had suggested that in worst case scenario 250,000 people would die in UK (30). A lockdown was finally imposed on the 23 March 2020. Was it already too late?

Government figures suggested 5.7% of the hospital doctors were off sick or absent because of Covid-19 (9).
