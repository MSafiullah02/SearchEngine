This is followed by the need for (a) rapid assay biosensors for high-throughput systems to hasten the speed for drug discovery (as required by the pharmaceutical industry), (b) rapid detection biosensors for chemical and biological warfare agents, and finally (c) biosensors to detect food pathogens (food safety) and environmental contaminants.

Besides, the biosensor can be used by nonmedics. This should find use in developing countries, for example, India. The biosensor system is based on the collection of a cough sample, followed by the detection of the pathogen. An immunoassay system is used along with fluorometry. The quick isolation of TB-infected patients should help considerably in the prevention of the spread of this re-emergent disease. The particular advantages of this biosensor are the high speed, low cost, and small size. Camilleri (2004) emphasizes that the intention is to develop a low-cost generic biosensor that would rapidly screen for other infectious diseases too.

Their biosensor can detect 104-107 cells/ml in less than 30 min. One may compare this to 72 h required by laboratory screening techniques. The biosensor is based on an antigen (pathogen)-antibody reaction. The biosensor surface has a \u2018capture\u2019 antibody, and a \u2018reporter\u2019 antibody. The primary advantage of this biosensor is that no amplification of the cell counts is required, which is the major cause of the time delay. Furthermore, the biosensor is able to detect the pathogen in the presence of other contaminants. Another distinct advantage is the major reduction in the cost for the biosensor which ranges from $1000 to $5000 as compared to the common immunoassay laboratory equipment that may cost in the range of $12000-$20000 per instrument. The researchers emphasize that, however, the field trials are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of their biosensor.",

It is reasonable to assume that the development cost of a biosensor lies between $20 and 30 million, and the time panel involved is between 7 and 10 years. This significant amount of investment and the losses incurred in the initial (recent) years before a profit occurs are bound to hinder smaller-sized companies from entering the market.

Other types of receptors for biosensors are also available. However, at present, we only analyze enzymes, antibodies, and microorganisms. These three types of receptors have advantages also, but here we concentrate only on the bottlenecks/disadvantages. As far as enzymes are concerned these receptors have limited shelf life, they are susceptible to inhibition by other (than the analyte) substances present in the sample, and ambient conditions. The shelf life of these types of biosensors may be increased by improving the way by which the enzyme(s) (or other receptors) are deposited on the biosensor surface (Biowise, 2000). Adverse pH and temperature conditions may quickly inactivate the enzyme making it useless as a receptor. Though significant advances are being made in antibody technology, this is still classified as an emerging technology, and target analytes may thus be limited (Biowise, 2000). Furthermore, antibodies are very specific and cannot detect unknown substances. The speed of response also needs to be improved when using antibodies in an ELISA format. The response time may generally decrease from hours (ELISA format) to minutes when they are used in a biosensor format. When microorganisms are used as receptors in a biosensor format, the results are often variable (Biowise, 2000), and the response time is larger than when other types of receptors are used on biosensor surfaces. Biowise (2000) further indicates that the response time needs to be decreased to the order of 15-60 min when microorganisms are used as receptors on biosensor surfaces for them to become competitive.",

This points to differing degrees of heterogeneity (different fractal dimensions, D\nf) (Sadana, 2003). The present author is not surprised with this statement, since in this whole chapter we have indicated that, in general, the binding and the dissociation coefficient(s) are very sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the biosensor surface. TFS, however, uses a unique self-calibrating method that minimizes the ill effects of these variations on the fiber optic surface on the reproducibility. Finally, tapered optical fibers result in yielding a better sensitivity. However, previous fabrication techniques were not suitable to manufacture these types of fibers. The TFS design process does overcome this limitation to a large degree.",

It is the leading provider of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. This instrument is continuously being upgraded by the company, and is very frequently used to analyze biomolecular reactions occurring on surfaces and interfaces. The advantage of the SPR biosensor is that it provides high-quality real-time data of these biomolecular interactions. The software that comes along with it does provide values of the binding and dissociation rate coefficients as well as affinity values. The SPR is an expensive piece of equipment and it generally costs around $300,000-400,000 depending on the model that one purchases. Unfortunately, and this may be the sole opinion of this author, the software program that comes along with the SPR biosensor does not take into account either the diffusional aspects or the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the SPR chip surface whilst analyzing the kinetics of biomolecular reactions. Other biosensor users are also gradually resorting to other types of biosensors to help analyze the kinetics of these biomolecular interactions. However, this point has been discussed quite a bit in the previous chapters of this book and will not be further discussed here. Over here, our main intention is to present an idea of the growth of Biacore from its inception in 1984.",

Biosensor Applications AB in Sundbyberg, Sweden was sold to private investors by Bofors in 1998 (Annual Report, January 1 to December31, 2003; http://www.biosensor.se/eng-ekinfo-nyhetsbrev_q1-2003.asp). Up until the year 2003, it had accumulated a loss of 170,947,236 Swedish Kroner. One Swedish Kroner equals 0.150 US dollar (www.exchangerate.com), December 6, 2004; 11:00 am, Central Standard Time). This is equivalent to US $25.6 million. However, the losses incurred by the company shows a decreasing trend, and very shortly the company is expected to show a profit. The losses incurred in the years 2002 and 2003 were 34,245,000 and 27,618,00 Swedish Kroner, respectively (Annual Report, January 1 to December 31, 2003; http://www.biosensor.se/eng-ekinfo-nyhetsbrev_q1-2003.asp). This is equivalent to $5.136 and 4.14 million, respectively. Its losses are decreasing by about $1 million per year. The company is making smart alliances worldwide (North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and Asia). It has also sold its first biosensor system to Japan and has carried out successful tests of its drug detection systems with the Canadian and American Customs authorities. In the year 2003, the company introduced its BIOSENS-D to worldwide markets. Once again, it may be noted that presumably around the year 2008 (10 years after it became independent from Bofors in 1998), Biosensor Applications AB, Sweden will start turning a profit. Though only one example of a small biosensor company is given, these numbers do appear to be typical with regard to investment and time of what it takes to make a biosensor company profitable.",

In the second case, biosensors are not the only product that one manufactures and attempts to sell in the market. For much better, and a more detailed, analysis on the commercial applications of biosensors one may refer to Biosensors: A Clearer View by Newman et al.

That too takes money, and needs to be considered as an \u2018expense.\u2019 One may offer an Initial Public Offering (IPO), for example.

            "text": "The above example indicates the general level of investment required to start-up a biosensor company. It is perhaps useful to do one's \u2018homework\u2019 or research the issue intensively, from different aspects, preferably by yourself, before one starts to invest time, money, and effort into a cost-intensive long-term project. Most people would consider a \u2018business model\u2019 prepared by consultants or experts in this field. Here we will attempt to provide just the basic overall perspectives and guidelines. The details may be filled out later, by interested individual(s), and depending on the type of biosensor project one is looking to establish. We will also attempt to provide a real-life example that perhaps fills the three criteria outlined below. This is just an example; more detailed criteria will surely be required:Criteria A. Identify a market, preferably a large on, even if it is highly competitive. The glucose monitoring market for diabetes quickly comes to mind. Another market, though presumably small, but does exhibit the potential to grow is the market for the diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune diseases, such as cancer, SLE, and arthritis. Serious consequences are involved if the ailment is not monitored and treated properly. Criteria B. Identify a need in the competitive market that is not yet filled, or the need is filled, but there is considerable room for improvement, for example, the pain and inconvenience for the monitoring of glucose. Another example could be the inconvenience of monitoring different analytes such as auto-antibodies, creatinine, etc for SLE, to help predict a \u2018flare\u2019 for the diseases so that it may be better managed. Recognize that one generally resorts to drugs such as steroids to better manage diseases such as SLE. Steroids have very significant side effects.Most of these drugs have serious side effects, as noted by the intense scrutiny on drugs such as Vioxx (removed from the market by Merck) and on Celebrex (still on the market: Pfizer; December 21, 2004). It may perhaps be useful to have a detection system that helps measure these side effects.Criteria C. Attempt to fill the need with advanced technology and newer approaches. Also, possess plans for future expansion.Pelikan Technologies in South San Francisco, California (2004) is attempting to introduce a hand-held biosensor that would specifically assist in the monitoring of glucose in the management of diabetes.Criteria A. This is a highly competitive market. This company estimates that there are 18.3 million diabetics in the United States alone. Each year 1.3 million diabetics are added to this number. Most reports, along with the American Diabetic Association (ADA), indicate that this autoimmune disease is reaching epidemic proportions. There are quite a few big name companies that have diagnostic devices and POC monitoring devices for determining glucose levels in blood. If the disease is not treated properly or glucose levels are not monitored carefully, then heart disease, blindness, kidney damage, and other medical conditions may result.Criteria B and C. Measuring of blood glucose levels is extremely painful and inconvenient. This often leads to negligence in glucose monitoring which is undesirable. Better, less invasive and painful measurement techniques would promote the compliance of measuring glucose levels. Pelikan's innovative and novel technology is aimed to address this issue of inconvenience and pain, and help provide an efficient blood glucose monitoring sensor. Pelikan technology is aimed at transforming the multi-step, painful, and \u2018difficult to use\u2019 present-day glucose monitoring systems to a one-step, simple to use and automated, and much less painful procedure which is also reliable. Furthermore, the company hopes to use their technology platform for the monitoring of analytes in blood for the detection of other ailments. This aspect cannot be over-emphasized, that is making the POC test painless. Even at a higher cost, it is safe to presume that if the test is painless, most individuals would purchase the POC test, and this would lead to a significantly higher compliance rate.\n",
