Infodemiology is defined as, \u201cthe science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy\u201d [7]. The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently offering free access to a collection of machine-readable literature that includes information regarding the group of coronaviruses [8]. The Allen Institute database currently contains more than 44,000 articles, of which 29,000 are full-text publications. Combining this database with other unstructured data from websites or social media can be used to expand our knowledge further regarding the early detection and containment of future outbreaks of COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases.

The use of data from glucometers among patients with diabetes could also be used as an objective indicator of infection, as high glucose levels correlate with signs and symptoms of infection [40]. Infectious respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19, have the potential to worsen symptoms of pre-existing lung disease, and thus exacerbate the use of emergency medications.

The technology applications mentioned above have the potential to reduce transmission by minimizing face-to-face contact between clinicians and patients. Furthermore, DH interventions enable healthcare providers to fight the global pandemic, even if they are practicing self-isolation measures or working remotely. Both Aiva [45] and Deloitte assistant [46] have created an AI-enabled patient communication solution that allows patients to request assistance, via Amazon Alexa or Google Home, without the need to press the traditional call bell button. Such interventions have the potential to reduce transmission because healthcare providers may be able to respond to many of the patient\u2019s needs without having to enter the patient\u2019s room. Thus, potentially reducing the frequency of a healthcare provider\u2019s exposure. ",
