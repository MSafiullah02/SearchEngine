Telaprevir therapy should be discontinued if these dermatologic complications occur, especially in cases of severe rash or even mild to moderate rash if accompanied by systemic symptoms.

The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. The antiviral therapeutic armamentarium has evolved over the years and is rapidly expanding. Some of the \u201cold\u201d antiviral drugs retain their clinical utility for most infections, such as acyclovir for herpes simplex virus and ganciclovir for CMV. However, other of these \u201cold\u201d antiviral drugs (eg, amantadine and rimantadine for influenza virus infections) have lost their clinical utility because of the rapid and widespread development of resistance. This serves as a catalyst for the development of novel therapies and, more importantly, should urge the medical community to use these drugs optimally in the clinical setting. Indeed, increased resistance has been observed to the neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza viruses and the nucleos(t)ide analogues for the treatment of CHB. As novel therapies develop (eg, the serine protease inhibitors for the treatment of CHC), care must be taken to optimize their use so that the clinical life span of these drugs is not abbreviated by the development of resistance.",
