The incidence and accuracy of diagnosis of chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis, continue to increase worldwide. Lung diseases affect both the individual and the surrounding society extensively, with impact of these diseases on the family, work place and health economics, including increasing costs for health care while a majority continues to be incurable. For most chronic lung diseases little progress has been made, in recent years, in the development of therapeutic strategies for managing these burdensome pathologies. There is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these diseases and for innovative approaches that will lead to the clinical breakthroughs that are currently lacking.",

Specialised cells that reside within, and in relation with, defined regions of the extracellular matrix (ECM) make up the main building blocks of these components. As one of the few organs that are directly exposed to environmental insults, the lung has an effective endogenous repair system that enables homeostasis to be maintained within the tissue. Whilst the exact mechanisms underlying most chronic lung diseases are not well understood, in many instances it is recognised that an aberration of the inherent repair process probably contributes to the pathophysiology that results in the diseased outcome [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The lung has a slow yet constant cell turnover that nevertheless cannot always cope with the loss of tissue and cells during (severe) injury or chronic disease [5] . During ageing, the respiratory system undergoes structural remodelling affecting both elements of the ECM and the cells, which leads to loss of elasticity and enlargement of alveolar spaces, with eventual airway narrowing because of loss of elastic recoil [10] . The result is a lung more susceptible to both acute and chronic insults, which becomes dysfunctional and with a lower breathing capacity that debilitates the patient [11] .",

COPD is currently the third leading cause of death in the world [17] , attributed to exposure to smoke by cigarette smoking and/or indoor cooking or by other harmful particles [19] . Alpha l-anti-trypsin deficiency is a genetic cause responsible for a minority of COPD incidence [18, 19] . The incidence of COPD is more often seen at a higher age, in particular because of the slow development of the disease before the clinical deterioration becomes apparent; the disease diagnosis therefore increases with age, peaking for patients between age 65 and 74, although patients who develop disease at a younger age usually have more severe disease. More than three million people died of COPD in 2012 accounting for 6% of all deaths worldwide. Globally, the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors, as mentioned above, and ageing of the population seriously impacting the health costs associated with managing these patients.",

            "text": "The pathological changes in COPD are observed in the central airways, small airways, alveolar space and vasculature [20] [21] [22] (see Fig. 1 .1). The central airway alterations include goblet cell hyperplasia, which are associated with the enlargement of mucus-producing glands and squamous cell metaplasia [23] . These changes are related to enhanced mucus production and cough in chronic bronchitis. The small airways, usually defined as airways with less than 2 mm internal diameter without cartilage, are considered the major site of increased airflow resistance in most patients with COPD [24] . Small airway wall thickening is observed, with increased smooth muscle mass and infiltration of inflammatory cells, and some alterations of epithelial cell differentiation leading to a variable shift of club-and ciliated cells to more goblet cells. This small airway wall thickening together with the loss of peri-bronchial elastic recoil is considered as the predominant cause of airflow limitation [10, 21] . Infiltration of [24] . The presence of macrophages and T lymphocytes, particularly CD8 + T cells, may in addition contribute to changes of the alveolar walls in COPD [25] [26] [27] . The chronic presence of these inflammatory cells leads to damage of the alveolar walls, and eventually, because of the lack of tissue repair in COPD [28, 29] , could lead to emphysema. Alteration of the pulmonary vasculature is now also considered as a vital component of COPD. This is caused by smooth muscle hypertrophy, which is associated with increased deposition of elastin and collagen [23, 30, 31] accompanied by apoptosis of the endothelial cells in the arterioles [32] , induced by the hypoxic conditions in the COPD lung.",

The quite random accumulation of excess fibrotic ECM leads to mostly irregular stiffening of the lung, with irregular compliance resulting in inadequate ventilation and diffusion with reduced oxygen transfer, breathing difficulties and eventually respiratory failure [40] . It is estimated that ILDs account for approximately 20% of the spectrum of lung diseases encountered in the practice of pulmonary medicine with varying degrees of pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory dysfunction [39] . Pulmonary fibrosis includes diseases such as scleroderma, radiation and chemotherapy-induced fibrosis and the most common form is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Although it is challenging to provide evaluations as to how many people are affected by IPF, it is estimated IPF affects approximately three million people worldwide. Approximately 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and the death toll due to IPF totals about 40,000 patients in the US each year. How many people are affected by IPF in Europe is not completely known but current estimates suggest that between 37,000 and 40,000 people will be diagnosed each year [41] . More importantly, it is anticipated that the number of individuals diagnosed with IPF will continue to increase, and by 2025 about 132,000 patients are expected to suffer this intractable and debilitating disease. The prognosis for patients with IPF is worse than for most cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, some forms of leukaemia and lymphoma [42] [43] [44] [45] . IPF is an irreversible and life-threatening lung degenerative disease characterized by the presence of lung scarring, immune infiltrates, and inflammation, which typically leads to respiratory failure. The clinical course of the disease is characterized by a progressive decline in exercise capacity, difficulty breathing, recurrent infections and severe impairment in lung function, which makes the patients dependent on long-term oxygen treatment [46, 47] .",

The persistent inflammation can result in a local milieu of pro-fibrotic cytokines and growth factors such as IL-13 and TGF-\u03b21 [52] [53] [54] . The pro-fibrotic environment causes fibroblasts to transform into myofibroblasts which are the main producers of ECM which stay active in the presence of TGF-\u03b2, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture [53] . Increasing research results indicate that the fibrotic response is also driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) [43] . AECs produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes and stimulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The mechanisms that link IPF with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; recent research results suggest that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes may have a role in driving these changes [44] .",

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease in preterm infants, affecting ~10-50% of all infants born before 32 weeks, and has long been defined by the need for supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation 28 days after birth (\"old BPD\") [62] . However, the advances in obstetric and neonatal care over the last half century have resulted in changes in pathophysiology and clinical presentation of BPD, and a new type of BPD has developed [63, 64] . More preterm infants born in the early stages of lung development presently suffer from BPD, with a frequency inversely correlated with gestational age. BPD develops as a result of lung injury caused by maternal pre-eclampsia, chorioamnionitis, postnatal ventilation, hyperoxia and/or inflammation, leading to arrested alveolar and microvascular development (fewer and larger alveoli), airway hyperreactivity and pulmonary hypertension [62, 65] . This indicates that the pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial, which means that it is difficult to predict and also prevent short-and long-term consequences of the disease.",

It is a chronic, progressive condition that can lead to right heart failure which can be lethal if not treated appropriately. As the presentation of this disease is similar to many other lung diseases (shortness of breath (dyspnea)-initially while exercising then building up while at rest, fatigue, dizziness or fainting (syncope), chest pressure or pain), this can lead to a delay in accurate timely diagnoses. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, based on World Health Organisation (WHO) classifications (groups) defined by the pathophysiology of the disease [68] [69] [70] . The most common form is WHO group 1, which refers to patients who have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a rare disease, affecting about 15 people per million worldwide. The cause of PAH is generally unknown, it is often referred to as idiopathic PAH, although genetic predisposition is recognised in familiar PAH. There are a number of pre-disposing conditions, including systemic sclerosis (particularly in the presence of ILD), human immunodeficiency virus and methamphetamine exposure, that are recognised to increase the prevalence of PAH [71] [72] [73] .",

In more severe disease, the so-called complex or plexiform lesions develop with a glomeruloid vascular process and a dilated venous part added to the obstructed arteriole [69] (see Fig. 1.1) . Vasoconstriction, associated with overproduction of endothelin-1 (vasoconstrictor) or underproduction of nitric oxide or prostacyclin (or both) (vasodilators), is often a disease characteristic.

It is most common in Caucasians of northern European descent, and least common in Asian-Americans [81] . The life expectancy of an individual with CF has increased steadily since the recognition of the disease in the 1950s; with advances in symptomatic treatments the estimated life expectancy for individuals with CF, born in 2016, is greater than 45 years (Cystic fibrosis registry 2016).",

The CFTR, expressed apically in epithelial cell membranes, is a transmembrane channel that is important for regulating cellular salt and fluid homeostasis. It is a chloride (Cl \u2212 ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) ion channel.

These mutations result in the accumulation of a thick, sticky mucus in the airways driving chronic inflammation and enabling recurrent respiratory infections usually initiating soon after birth. Animal studies reflect the pathological changes in the airways, also suggesting the trachea is narrowed. The neutrophil influx, in response to the ongoing airway inflammation, leads to further inflammation as a result of the release of neutrophil elastase and other proinflammatory cytokines [87, 88] . This vicious cycle drives remodelling of the airway wall tissues, resulting in air trapping and bronchiectasis (see Fig. 1.1 ).",

More recently there have been exciting developments of therapeutics aimed at \"correcting\" and \"potentiating\" CFTR. Vertex Pharmaceuticals have obtained FDA approval for the use of VX-770 (CFTR corrector, ivacaftor, trade name Kalydeco) [90, 91] and VX-809 (CFTR potentiator, lumacaftor) [92] for clinical use in CF patients with specific mutations [93] . Combination therapies that aim to improve the functionality and stability of the CFTR at the epithelia cell surface are now being developed [94] . These approaches have made significant advances and improvements in the quality of life for many patients with CF, but they are not effective for all mutations of CFTR. These approaches help to reduce the ongoing inflammation, but it is not clear if they are able to address the structural remodelling in the lung tissues.",

The last phase is a repair phase in which the alveolar epithelium is regenerated through proliferation of the type II cells and differentiation to type I cells. This enables restoration of the permeability of the basal membranes and allows fluid clearance from the airspaces. The vascular changes also reverse during this stage. The final stage can be complete resolution but very often is characterized by impressive thickening of alveolar septa by fibroblast proliferation without obvious collagen fibrosis with subsequent severe lung function problems and often a poor prognosis. In some cases a fibrotic phase can follow where collagen and other ECM proteins are deposited resulting in a partially stable fibrotic lung.
