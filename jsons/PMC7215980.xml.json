            "text": "At present, research on the association between ambient temperature and human health has mainly focused on the effects of extreme heat weather, and public health plans have implemented policies and interventions designed almost exclusively for heat wave [5,6]. However, a cold spell risk is generally ignored compared with previous studies focusing on heat waves [7,8]. Some studies have shown that the risk of extreme cold temperature was consistently higher than the risk of heat temperature on human health. Chen et al. [9] reported that 1.14% and 0.63% of non-accidental total mortality was attributable to extreme cold and extreme heat temperatures, respectively. In UK regions, cold-related mortality accounts for more than one order of magnitude than heat-related mortality. Every year, approximately 33 and two deaths per 100,000 population in Australian cities are associated with cold and heat temperature, respectively [10]. Moreover, some studies have reported that the effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to moderate temperature. A multi-country observational study demonstrated that 7.71% of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in 384 locations within the study period between 1985 and 2012, where the extreme cold and heat temperatures were responsible for 0.86% of total mortality [11]. A previous study showed that a moderately cold temperature was associated with a higher attributable risk (6.3%, 1.1 to 11.1) than extremely cold temperatures, moderately heat temperatures, and extremely heat temperatures, each of which were less than 0.6% [12]. One study even suggested that the preventive efforts were the same for warm and cold days and heat and cold waves [13]. Thus, more studies should be extended to take account of the whole range of effects associated with ambient temperature. Some studies have been published concerning the impact of daily ambient temperature on mortality or morbidity [14,15]. However, those approaches failed to consider the differences in age, resulting in incomplete analysis of information. One approach to avoid the drawback is to consider year of life lost (YLL) as the outcome indicator instead of mortality. YLL, an important part of disability adjusted life years, is a measure of disease burden that uses the life expectancy. Compared with the traditional measure of mortality, YLL gives more weight to deaths among younger people [16]. YLL has been regarded as a more novel and precise indicator to evaluate the burden of disease and is used to identify and prioritize causes of premature deaths [17,18]. To date, the ambient temperature-related YLL has only been studied by a few investigators, and the effects among different cause-specific death and socioeconomic status are also less clear.",

Heat temperature had a significant impact on YLL due to cardiovascular disease death, with an attributable fraction of 0.50%. However, the effects of cold and heat temperature were not significantly in respiratory disease death. The attributable risk for cardiovascular disease death in our study was different with other studies. One study showed that attributable fraction to cold effect was from 2.67 to 8.55, and the attributable fraction to heat effect was from 0.16 to 2.29 due to cardiovascular disease in China [25]. Li et al. [26] reported that mild cold temperature contributed the largest fraction to YLL (16.31%). Various underlying mechanisms have been postulated to explain the increased YLL risk associated with high and low ambient temperature. Cardiovascular mortality has been shown to increase in the winter. Exposure to cold temperatures was associated with cardiovascular death by inducing increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, platelet count and serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration, and initiating a mild inflammatory reaction [27,28]. In addition, the main underlying mechanism for heat temperature related YLL is that stress on the cardiovascular systems increases during periods of high ambient temperature, especially among elderly people with limited adaptive responses. In elderly people, the ability to thermoregulate body temperatures is reduced [29].",

Thus, from the public health perspective, the government should pay more attention to cold weather to reduce life lost.

The analysis of data from 70 locations provides evidence for ambient temperature related YLL in a wide range of populations with different genders and ages. Our results demonstrated that cold and heat temperatures had significant impacts on YLL for people aged up to 65 years. Moreover, people aged over 65 years were at higher YLL risk of both heat and cold temperatures than young group. Studies have shown that elderly people are the most vulnerable group to cold or heat temperatures [31,32]. This may be caused by relatively poorer physiological adaptation and pre-existing chronic diseases among the elderly. We found that extreme cold temperatures had effect on all age groups due to different disease-cause mortality. With the increasing societal resources on preventive cares for the elderly, the protecting measures for the youth to combat the harmful effects of extreme cold temperatures should not be ignored. Our results also indicated that both cold and heat temperature-associated YLLs were higher in females than males. Differences in socioeconomic factors and ability to withstand cold and heat stress between genders, may lead to the increase of sensitivity of women [33].
