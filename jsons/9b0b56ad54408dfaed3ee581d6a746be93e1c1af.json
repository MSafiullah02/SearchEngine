            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic, fatal, viral-induced, immune-mediated disease of cats caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Mefloquine, a human antimalarial agent, has been shown to inhibit FIPV in vitro. As a first step to evaluate its efficacy and safety profile as a potential FIP treatment for cats, mefloquine underwent incubation in feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase I metabolism cofactors to determine its rate of phase I depletion. Tramadol was used as a phase I positive control as it undergoes this reaction in both dogs and cats. Using the substrate depletion method, the in vitro intrinsic clearance (mean \u00b1 S.D.) of mefloquine by pooled feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes was 4.5 \u00b1 0.35 and 18.25 \u00b1 3.18 \u03bcL/min/mg protein, respectively. However, phase I intrinsic clearance was too slow to determine with canine microsomes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified carboxymefloquine in samples generated by feline microsomes as well as negative controls, suggesting some mefloquine instability. Mefloquine also underwent incubation with feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase II glucuronidative metabolism cofactors. O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT or M1) was used as a positive control as it undergoes a phase II glucuronidation reaction in these species. The rates of phase II mefloquine depletion by microsomes by all three species were too slow to estimate. Therefore mefloquine likely undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism catalysed by feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes but not phase II glucuronidative metabolism in all three species and mefloquine is not likely to have delayed elimination in cats with clinically normal, hepatic function.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis is a systemic, fatal, viral-induced immune-mediated disease primarily affecting younger cats [1, 2] . It is caused by a virulent biotype of feline coronaviruses (FCoV) known as FIPV. Previously used therapies for FIP have either relied on immunosuppressive agents to dampen clinical signs temporarily, or attempted to repurpose human antiviral treatments, with neither approach achieving lasting success [3] . Recently, therapeutic drugs have been identified that address the underlying problem of feline coronavirus replication [4, 5] . However, veterinary access to these antiviral treatments is currently problematic. Consequently, additional inexpensive, safe, antiviral treatments, such as those accessible by prescription, require investigation for their potential to treat FIPV infected cats. The demand for efficacious antivirals against FIPV is crucial both for reducing clinical disease with minimal adverse effects, as well as the potential for preventing individual treatments selecting for viral resistance.",

            "text": "The antimalarial drug mefloquine is currently used for both prevention (as a monotherapy) and treatment (either alone, or in combination with artesunate) of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans [6] [7] [8] . It was found to substantially reduce the viral load of FIPV and feline calicivirus (FCV) at low concentrations in infected Crandell Rees feline kidney cells without cytotoxic effects [9, 10] . This observation suggested that mefloquine may be useful when administered to cats with FIP or FCV related disease [9] . However, mefloquine undergoes substantial hepatic metabolism in people [11, 12] . As cats lack several major phenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes required for phase II glucuronidative metabolism [13, 14] , it is prudent to obtain information about mefloquine's intrinsic clearance in the cat before conducting clinical trials in the live animal. Although there are many models by which to assess in vitro metabolism, microsomes contain many (but not all) hepatic metabolic enzymes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain mefloquine's in vitro intrinsic clearance (in vitro Cl int ) when incubated with feline hepatic microsomes with respect to both phase I (e.g., oxidation, hydrolysis or reduction reactions) and phase II (e.g., conjugative glucuronidation) metabolism. Likewise, mefloquine was also incubated with canine microsomes for both phase I and phase II metabolism reactions in order to compare the rate of in vitro clearance of mefloquine between feline and canine microsomes. Mefloquine's phase I metabolism by canine microsomes has been previously reported [11] and in contrast to cats, dogs are not known to experience delayed phase II conjugative metabolism. Mefloquine was also incubated with microsomes from the common brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as this species of possum is recognised as a rapid xenobiotic metaboliser [15] .",

The common brush-tailed possum microsomes (2 females and one male) were extracted and prepared according to Hill (2003) [16] and modified by Kimble et al. (2014) [15] . Prior to liver collection, possums were euthanized with pentobarbitone for humane reasons independent of this study. These animals demonstrated no outward clinical signs of hepatic disease and their livers appeared grossly unremarkable on post-mortem examination. Liver collection was approved by The University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (AEC protocol: 2013/6062). Commercially procured feline and canine microsomes had a hepatic microsomal protein concentration of 20 mg/mL as did those of the common brushtailed possum microsomes. The activity of the canine and feline microsomes as determined by the manufacturer are presented in the Supplementary information file (S1 Table) . The common brush-tailed possum hepatic microsomal protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) standardized with bovine serum albumin [17] .

This peak was subsequently identified by SRM as carboxymefloquine but it was also identified by SRM in both the canine incubation samples and the negative controls. Carboxymefloquine is not considered a metabolite generated by the feline microsomes because of its presence in negative controls and phase I metabolism reactions are not associated with carboxylation.

Although this is not uncommon practice, use of pooled microsomes may have overlooked differences in one or more individual's metabolic capacity. Moreover, during the phase II metabolism studies, phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used as described by Slovak et al. (2017) [14] . However, the use of Tris buffer (as opposed to a phosphate buffer) has been shown to lead to an increase in the activity of some UGTs (such as UGT1A4 and UGT1A9) when incubated with human liver microsomes [32] . Yet, as this was a comparative species microsomal study, the use of phosphate buffer should have little consequence unless a species had significantly different concentrations and/or activities of hepatic UGTs. Furthermore, in contrast to the common brush-tailed possums microsomes that were harvested by the authors, the feline and canine microsomes were purchased from Europe since they could not be sourced locally. Although quality control information concerning activity for various substrates was provided by the manufacturer, the results may have been different if the microsomes from all three species underwent the same extraction, transportation and storage conditions. Finally, as the canine and feline microsomes only contained contributions from male subjects, the activity of CYP3A is recognized to have different activity for a substrate which is sex dependent [33] , therefore further research evaluating sex differences in substrate intrinsic clearance may be required.",

One of these agents is a broad spectrum coronavirus protease inhibitor, GC376 [48] , while the other is an adenosine nucleoside analogue, GS-441524 [4, 5] . However, neither of these antivirals have obtained registration for veterinary use. Consequently, it remains important that investigations into a readily available drug such as mefloquine with anti-FIPV activity, is urgently required for this invariably fatal disease. This in vitro study provides information on mefloquine's hepatic metabolism in cats and indicates that it does not result in delayed metabolism in cats. Further studies should be undertaken to describe mefloquine's PK profile in the cat as well as its efficacy in treating FIPV and FCV infected cats.",
