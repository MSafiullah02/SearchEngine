Camels are considered the likely animal source for zoonotic infection; sporadic human-to-human transmission does occur, but is considered to be inefficient based on currently available data [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Until recently, new MERS-CoV infections in humans were reported at a steady low rate reaching \u223c200 confirmed human cases early 2014. In March and April 2014, however, a surge of MERS-CoV infections occurred mainly in hospitals around Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE). This increased case load was in part attributed to an increase in community cases, but mostly to transmission within hospitals, with no evidence for evolution of a MERS-CoV variant with more efficient human-to-human transmission capabilities (WHO;http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_Update_09_May_2014.pdf?ua\n=\n1). The ongoing occurrence of new cases, however, and the finding that MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary camels in a wide geographic region [3], [10], [11], stresses the need for surveillance of strain diversity, to help unravel the epidemiology of this newly identified pathogen, and to provide a reference for studies into MERS-CoV evolution.",

To remove the redundancy from the dataset, FastGroupII analysis (http://fastgroup.sdsu.edu/fg_tools.htm) was performed grouping all currently available viral genomes based on nucleotide composition, resulting in 15 groups (Table 1). One viral genome from each group was taken as representative in subsequent analyses. A summary of nucleotide positions that vary across the genomes was created using BioEdit v7.2.0 [15] and the number of nucleotide positions with variations was plotted over 1000 nucleotide windows. PhyML trees were generated using Seaview 4 software with the approximate likelihood ratio test based on a Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa-like procedure which used general time reversible as substitution model. Nearest neighbor interchange, subtree pruning, and regrafting-based tree search algorithms were used to estimate tree topologies, as described previously [5].",

However, phylogenetic analysis of these genome regions separately did not provide reliable phylogenetic information, in contrast to an analysis of the concatenated fragments [5], [12], [19]. Subsequent analyses revealed a region in the open reading frame that encodes the spike protein with a number of positions in which nucleotide variation occurs between MERS-CoV variants with a strong phylogenetic signal regarding previously identified clusters of viruses based on full-length MERS-CoV genomes. The here-described MERS-CoV variant typing assay based on a 615 bp spike fragment provides a crude indication of the MERS-CoV variant under study on the basis of four identified clusters of MERS-CoV variants, exemplified by MERS-CoV Qatar_3_2014, England/Qatar_2012, EMC_2012, and Egypt_Camel_NRCE-HKU205_2014. In silico, the assay accurately typed all currently known MERS-CoVs for which full-length genomes are available, including the recently released Florida/USA_2_KSA_2014 and Indiana/USA-1_KSA_2014 strains. This was confirmed by typing of samples available in our laboratory from the first two Dutch MERS-CoV cases that phylogenetically grouped with Indiana/USA-1_KSA_2014 and other viruses in cluster I [19] and from camels from a slaughterhouse in Doha, Qatar [13]. The observed detection limit of a cycle treshold value of \u223c35 allows variant typing in clinical samples obtained from humans and animals with relatively low viral loads. It enables inclusion of samples in phylogenetic analysis that would not have been included when only full length genomes would have been accepted.",

New variants identified through this initial screening could then be sent to a reference laboratory for further characterization. The continued occurrence of transmission between humans in health care and family settings is an ongoing concern as stated by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_Update_27_March_2014.pdf?ua=1), although the outbreaks appear to be self\u2010limiting or extinguishable with rigorous implementation of appropriate infection control guidelines at present.

Four major MERS-CoV clusters are indicated (A, B1, B2, C). (B) The number of nucleotide positions with variations over 15 representative MERS-CoV genomes (Supplementary Table 1) was plotted over 1000 nucleotide windows. A schematic diagram of the MERS-CoV genome is depicted below the graph, and four fragments with the highest number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are indicated with black boxes. The dotted line indicates the average number of SNPs per 1000 nt window added with 1x standard deviation. In red, nucleotide positions displaying considerable phylogenetic information regarding four identified MERS-CoV variant clusters and the red box indicates the 615 bp fragment of the here-described MERS-CoV variant typing assay.
