The government had imposed quarantine and lockdown on the city of Chongqing in an unprecedented effort to contain the COVOD-19 epidemic, and all members of the workforce were required to cease working from January 31 2020 to February 9 2020, except for those who were responsible for providing living necessities and emergency services. The COVID-19 has shattered the daily routine, business, schools, lifestyle and economy of the globe (Gautam and Sharma, 2020) . Most of the current COVID-19 research focused on physical health, but research data on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking , Qiu et al., 2020 . A recent study surveyed 1210 Chinese respondents during the COVID-19 outbreak and found that more than 50% of respondents reported moderate or severe psychological impact . COVID-19 was recently found to be associated with neurological damages. (Wu et al., 2020) . Psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression) and neurological changes can impair cognitive functioning (Husain et al., 2020 , Subramaniapillai et al., 2019 , Wu et al., 2020 and work performance. (Lee et al., 2018b) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major focus of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) research is on understanding disease vulnerability, prevention and psychological resilience (Sominsky et al., 2020) .",

Outside the hospital setting, workplace can be perfect breeding ground for the virus (Kim and Su, 2020) . As there is no effective vaccine and treatment against COVID-19, the psychoneuroimmunity preventive measures at the workplace should include personal preventive measures (e.g. wearing a face mask, hand hygiene, other personal precaution) and organizational measures (e.g. good ventilation, social distancing at work, COVID-19 testing for workers if adequate resources). Due to prolonged lockdown and business closure, people experience social isolation, disruption of lifestyle and loss of personal income while society loses its productivity in a crippling economy. Returning to work and minimizing the spread of COVID-19 will improve self-esteem, financial situation and rebuild social connection while enhancing productivity of the society, leading to better quality of life, less depression and stress, and better immunity (Evans and Repper, 2000 , Modini et al., 2016 , Liu et al., 2012a , Lu et al., 2017 . The psychoneuroimmunity preventive measures can be seen from a systemic perspective. The resumption of productivity is particularly important for industries that produce medical supplies. This will protect front-line health professionals so that they turn their energy to focus on treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 (Kim and Su, 2020) , rendering our health systems to be more resilient. Companies and factories also need to implement psychological support systems to provide a safe and healthy working environment to minimize potential anxiety and stress when workers return to work (Kim and Su, 2020) . There will be a new model of the economy based on psychoneuroimmunity preventive measures, whereby the focus will be on protecting the immunity and health of workers against COVID-19, and at the same time, not sacrificing productivity.",

Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include personal hygiene measures (e.g. hand hygiene, wearing masks) and organizational measures (e.g. social distancing, good ventilation). (Kim and Su, 2020) These measures may safeguard mental health by improving mood and quality of sleep. The COVID-19 pandemic and the public health response substantially changed working conditions for the workforce by implementing psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures. To date, there has been no published literature on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce who returned to work during COVID pandemic although Europe and the U.S. planned to get European get back to work and reopen American economy respectively (Chrysoloras, 2020) . Recent research mainly focused on mental health of health professionals (Shi et al., 2020 , Kang et al., 2020 , Mukhtar, 2020 , Shao et al., 2020 . Studying the psychological impact and psychiatric symptoms of the Chinese workforce may provide valuable information for other countries. We, therefore, conducted the first study to investigate the immediate psychological impact on the workforce who returned to work after lockdown and quarantine in Chongqing, China. We hypothesized that there was no difference between managers and workers in the mean scores of psychiatric symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify demographic and psychoneuroimmunity preventive measures that determined the mental health of the members of the workforce who returned to work when the risk for contracting COVID-19 remains unknown.",

At the beginning of the outbreak, the mean IES-R score of the general population was 32.98, which was at least three times higher than the mean IES-R score (9.8) reported by the workforce in this study. Similarly, 16.5% of the general population reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. In our study, the workforce showed a much lower prevalence of above symptoms. A recent study in China also found that the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses. Our study found several factors that could decrease the likelihood that the workforce would experience psychiatric symptoms. These factors included personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures such as the frequent practice of hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company on the health status of employees. From public health viewpoints, a recent study found that the extent that people proactively engaged in hand hygiene could predict the speed of COVID-19 outbreak (Lin et al., 2020) . From psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) viewpoints, previous studies found that the immune system could be improved by reducing negative psychological state such as depression (Liu et al., 2012b , Ng et al., 2018 , Lu et al., 2017 , which could reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. In addition to above factors, the China government imposed the following psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures to prevent the in-house spread of COVID-19 at the workplace:, avoidance of large gatherings and maintain interpersonal distance, tracking the health status of employees, disinfection of workplace, shutdown central air-conditioning and dissemination of facts about COVID-19 prevention (Xinhua, 2020) . These psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures might play a role in causing a low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms observed in our respondents. Furthermore, we found that 93.5% of respondents did not experience any discrimination during the COVID-19 epidemic. It could be due to the recommendation from China government to request employers to prevent and curb discrimination against confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 within the business (Xinhua, 2020).",

Online staff forums or counselling hotlines would provide an opportunity for cathartic ventilation and sharing information while minimizing face-to-face contact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early identification of risk factors by employers, stress management and professional psychological consulting services might reduce the severity of psychiatric symptoms of a small proportion of employees who were at risk.
