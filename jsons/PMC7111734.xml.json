PRRSV is one of the most economically important diseases of swine which is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs (Rossow, 1998). Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to secondary infection by bacterial and viral pathogens (Mateu and Diaz, 2008). However, to date, there is no efficient antiviral agent or method available against PRRSV, and unfortunately, both traditional-control strategies and conventional vaccines are insufficient to provide sustainable control of PRRSV (Darwich et al., 2010), so it is very important and urgent to develop therapeutic strategies to control PRRSV effectively.",

Previous studies have indicated that the nsp1\u03b1 was essential for the synthesis of PRRSV subgenomic mRNA and it may play an important role in the virulence of PRRSV (Kroese et al, 2008, Nedialkova et al, 2010). However, whether the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 facilitates the replication of the virus and siRNAs targeting the nsp1\u03b1 can influence the replication of PRRSV was not clear. In this work, we firstly constructed an expression plasmid encoding a GFP-nsp1\u03b1 fusion polypeptide (pcDNA3.1-GFP-nsp1\u03b1)(GFP-nsp1\u03b1) by subcloning from the plasmid pcDNA3.1-FLAG-nsp1\u03b1 (Shi et al., 2011) to pcDNA3.1-GFP (Shi et al., 2013) using the restriction endonuclease Hind III and EcoRI, and the results of the western-blot experiment in Fig. 1A\nconfirmed the successful expression of GFP-nsp1\u03b1. Secondly, in order to investigate the effect of nsp1\u03b1 on the replication of PRRSV, the MARC-145 cells were grown in 24-well plates overnight, and then the cells were transfected with expression plasmid GFP-nsp1\u03b1 or the control plasmid pcDNA3.1-GFP. Six hours after transfection, the cells were infected with BJ-4 PRRSV at a MOI of 0.1, and 24 hours later, the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing repeatedly. The supernatants were obtained and the virus yields were measured by 50% tissue culture infected dose (TCID50) using the Reed\u2013Muench method in MARC-145 cells. The result in Fig. 1B showed that the viral titer in the MARC-145 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-GFP-nsp1\u03b1 has been increased to 1.5 times as compared with that in the MARC-145 cells transfected with control plasmid.",

We designed three siRNAs 5\u2032-CAGTCTTGAAGG CTCTACA-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CTGAACTTCCAACAAAGAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCAGTGGAAACCTGAACTT-3\u2032 that specially targeted nucleic acid sequence of nsp1\u03b1, and a control siRNA 5\u2032-CCTACGCCACCAATTTCGT-3\u2032 (a random sequence not found in the virus and host genome). MARC-145 cells grown in 24-well plates were co-transfected in triplicate with the nsp1\u03b1 siRNA (100 nM/well) and the plasmid GFP-nsp1\u03b1 (800 ng/well). Twenty four hours later, the cells in five random fields were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (50\u00d7) and only one of them were shown in Fig. 2\n. The results in Fig. 2A showed that all of the three siRNAs targeting nsp1\u03b1 could inhibit the expression of GFP-nsp1\u03b1 and did not influence the expression of GFP. Similar results were obtained when HEK293T cells were in place of MARC-145 cells (data not shown). Finally, two siRNAs targeting nucleic acid sequence of nsp1\u03b1 were selected to determine whether they could reduce the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cell. MARC-145 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected in triplicate with the nsp1\u03b1 siRNA 1(100 nM), nsp1\u03b1 siRNA 2 (100 nM) or control siRNA (100 nM). Six hours later after the transfection, the cells were infected with PRRSV at a MOI of 0.1 or mock infected, and 24 hours later, the cells were lysed and then viral titers were measured by TCID50. The results in Fig. 2B showed that siRNAs targeting nucleic acid sequence of nsp1\u03b1 could significantly reduce the replication of PRRSV.",

In this work, we also explore whether the siRNA, which targeted the nucleic acid sequence of nsp1\u03b1, influenced the replication of PRRSV, and the results showed that siRNA targeting nsp1\u03b1 significantly reduced the replication of PRRSV (Fig. 2). The inhibition of specific genes by siRNA in recent years has been proven to be a potential therapeutic strategy against viral infection (Mahmoodur et al., 2008), especially for positive single stranded RNA viruses since their genomes function as both the mRNA and the replication template (Idrees, Ashfaq, 2013, Idrees et al, 2013), and additionally, a recent improved live PRRSV vaccine has indicated that ORF1a and ORF1b were virulence determinants in PRRSV (Wang et al., 2008), therefore, it is reasonable to propose that our present results provided a basis for generating the new PRRSV vaccine by targeting PRRSV nsp1\u03b1.",
