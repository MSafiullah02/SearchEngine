            "text": "The GRADE Working Group has described the steps required to review evidence.8, 9, 10 The GRADE Working Group proposes that a recommendation should indicate a decision that the majority of well-informed individuals would make. For self-limited conditions with low risk of complications, even well-informed individuals may reach different conclusions. Therefore, the authors have tried to provide an evidence summary that will assist discussions with families (Table 3\n). The authors' own approach (informed by the best available evidence) is described in Box 1\n.Box 1Suggested approach when assessing and managing a child with OM\n1.Take a history of the presenting complaint to elicit the primary symptoms: nasal discharge or sore throat (nonspecific URTI), ear pain, ear discharge, or hearing loss (OM). Ask about frequency and severity of previous episodes. Clarify duration of illness and presence of any associated features including cough (bronchitis), fever, respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor feeding, or lethargy. Determine the concerns, expectations, and preferences of the child and their carer. (Grade: very low; Level of evidence: cohort studies and other evidence.)2.Examine the child to confirm whether investigation and management strategy should include OM. Assess temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate, presence and color of nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial tenderness, tonsillar enlargement, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, presence of cough, presence of middle ear effusion (using pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry), and position and integrity of tympanic membrane. Ensure normal hydration, perfusion, conscious state, and no meningism, periorbital swelling, proptosis, limitation of eye movements, upper airway obstruction, respiratory distress, or mastoid tenderness. (Grade: very low; Level of evidence: cohort studies and other evidence.)3.Investigations:\u2022Otitis media with effusion (OME): None required for most children. If effusions are bilateral and persistent for >3 months, then organize a hearing test. (Grade: low; Level of evidence: cohort studies.)\u2022AOM: None required unless febrile and <3 months of age, or danger signs present (respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor feeding, or lethargy). (Grade: low; Level of evidence: cohort studies.)\u2022Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM): Organize a hearing test. Imaging (computed tomography scan) is appropriate if CSOM is persistent despite treatment and the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized. (Grade: low; Level of evidence: cohort studies)\n4.Management:\u2022OME: No immediate treatment required. Review at 3 months is appropriate if bilateral effusions are present and child is from a high-risk population. (Grade: low; Level of evidence: cohort studies.)\u2022AOM: Symptomatic pain relief if indicated, watchful waiting with advice to parents on likely course and possible complications. For low-risk populations, antibiotics are most likely to benefit those who have AOM with perforation, <2 years and bilateral AOM, already had 48 hours of watchful waiting and no improvement, or are at high risk of suppurative complications (especially perforation of the tympanic membrane). For high-risk populations, antibiotics are recommended. (Grade: high; Level of evidence: RCTs.)\u2022CSOM: Cleaning ear discharge from external canal and topical antibiotics are recommended. (Grade: high; Level of evidence: RCTs.)\n\n",

The search reported here did not identify any studies that were able to answer this question.",

The range of bacterial pathogens associated with CSOM is considerably broader than those seen in AOM. Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Proteus, and Klebsiella species are most commonly isolated, and mixed infections are common.79 Multidrug antibiotic resistance is often seen in Pseudomonas infections.

When considering the onset of the illness, there is evidence on the preventive effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and influenza vaccine (see Table 3).11, 12, 13, 24 Both of these vaccines have been shown to be effective, but the beneficial effects in terms of overall rates of infection are slight. The beneficial effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are modest in terms of reductions in the insertion of tympanostomy tubes.84 Most children in low-risk populations will not meet the criteria for tympanostomy tube insertion. There is also evidence on the treatment effects of antihistamines and decongestants, antibiotics, myringotomy, and analgesics (see Table 3).21, 23, 24, 25, 27 Regular analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen) provide a benefit (assessment on day 2), and the beneficial effects were large.24 Antibiotics are also proven to be effective.22, 23 The short-term beneficial effects are slight in most children. The beneficial effects are modest in children younger than 2 years with bilateral AOM, and large in those with AOM with perforation. Studies of initial treatment with antibiotics have not documented a long-term effect. If antibiotics are to be used, there is evidence that a longer course of treatment (\u22657 days) is more effective but the beneficial effects are modest (persistent AOM reduced from 22% to 15%).85 There is no evidence to support the belief that any one of the commonly used antibiotics is more effective than the others. The use of antihistamines and decongestants has not been shown to be beneficial, and myringotomy seems to be harmful compared with no treatment or antibiotics (see Table 3).21, 24, 27\n",

The rates of AOM also reduce spontaneously without treatment so that absolute benefits are less impressive than anticipated. Two of the RCTs assessing prophylactic antibiotics have been conducted in Indigenous children.39, 40 These studies demonstrate that prophylactic antibiotics will prevent perforation of the tympanic membrane. The size of the benefit is similar to prevention of any AOM. Insertion of tympanostomy tubes also seems to reduce rates of AOM, and the effect is similar to antibiotics. Either of these options could be considered in those children from low-risk populations with very frequent infections (especially if occurring before the peak of respiratory illness in winter). However, children with tympanostomy tubes may develop a discharging ear, so this is not a good option in children at increased risk of suppurative infections (including those with immunodeficiency or persistent bacterial rhinosinusitis). For Indigenous children in high-risk populations, prophylactic antibiotics or prompt antibiotic treatment of infections are probably the more appropriate treatment options. Adenoidectomy does not seem to be an effective treatment.27, 28, 29\n",

Most studies have not documented a long-term effect. Topical antibiotics also seem to be more effective than antiseptics and systemic antibiotics.31 The role of topical antibiotics plus systematic antibiotics is unclear.90 Cleaning the middle ear discharge has not been proven to be effective in RCTs but is generally regarded as necessary before insertion of topical antibiotics (at least in children with profuse discharge). Although not seen in RCTs, there is also a very small risk of ototoxicity associated with most topical antibiotics (except topical quinolones) and topical antiseptics.27 For children who fail to respond to prolonged courses of topical antibiotics, 2 small studies (85 participants) have documented high cure rates and large beneficial effects associated with 2 to 3 weeks of intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics (such as ceftazidime).91, 92\n",

However, even though this is an effective treatment, prolonged or repeated courses of treatment are often required. If this is the case, topical quinolones will provide a slight benefit in terms of risk of ototoxicity. Even in high-risk Indigenous populations there is a considerable difference in the likely response to treatment. Two RCTs comparing ciprofloxacin drops with framycetin-gramycidin-dexamethasone drops in Australian Aboriginal children with CSOM have been conducted. One trial found most children could be effectively treated within 9 days, whereas the other reported most children with persistent CSOM despite 6 weeks of treatment.41, 42\n",

Therefore, for low-risk children symptomatic relief and watchful waiting (including education of the parents about important danger signs) is the most appropriate treatment option. Antibiotics have a role in children with persistent bacterial infection, or those at risk of complications. Even today, many Indigenous children will often fall into these high-risk groups.",
