            "text": "The spread of infectious diseases has become a global health concern. In 2002, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and first identified in Guangdong Province, China, occurred and spread to several countries [1], [2]. In total, 8273 cases and 775 deaths attributed to SARS were reported in multiple countries according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In April 2009, the outbreak of a novel influenza A H1N1 virus in Mexico spread globally and developed into the first human influenza pandemic in 40 years [3], [4]. To diagnose infectious diseases quickly and accurately, DNA sequencers for genetic analysis of infectious viruses have been developed rapidly. Newly developed \u201cnext-generation\u201d sequencing technologies for massively parallel DNA sequencing are in fairly widespread use at present [5], [6]. However, in order to diagnose infectious diseases using DNA sequences, the virus in the clinical sample must be purified and enriched in concentration before DNA sequencing [7]. These pretreatment processes are labor-intensive, cumbersome and time consuming. There is therefore need to speed up the pretreatment of clinical samples before DNA sequencing to complement the throughput of DNA sequencers. We here describe a novel microfluidic chip for purifying and enriching viruses. The microfluidic chip has many advantages; it requires only a small work place, a small sample volume, an enclosed region, and is comparatively low cost.",

Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)(OH)2) is a very complex crystalline compound to which a variety of substances adsorb. It has been used extensively as a matrix for the purification and fractionation of an array of biochemical substances, including enzymes, nucleic acids, hormones, and viruses [15]. Many researchers have reported that the interaction between hydroxyapatite and an electrically charged adsorbate is due to ion exchange or static attraction [16], [17].",

Fig. 2\nshows the processes used to fabricate a PDMS (Silpot 184, Toray-Dow Corning Co., Tokyo, Japan) microchannel and bond it to a PDMS substrate. A PDMS microchannel was produced by replica molding using a master mold fabricated by photolithography [18]. A negative-type photoresist (SU-8 3050, Kayaku MicroChem Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was spin-coated on a silicon substrate. Spin-coating condition was 1000 rpm for 30 s. After prebaking at 95 \u00b0C for 3 h, ultraviolet light was irradiated through a photomask to produce a microchannel pattern using a mask aligner (MJB-3, Suss Microtec, Garching, Germany). After post-exposure baking at 65 \u00b0C for 30 s and at 95 \u00b0C for 60 s, the substrate was then developed in PM thinner for 8 min and rinsed in ethanol. The channel was 100 \u03bcm high. Unpolymerized PDMS (resin:catalyst = 10:1) was poured into the mold and cured in an oven at 90 \u00b0C for 20 min. The replica was then peeled from the master and the PDMS microchannel was ultrasonically rinsed in ethanol. The PDMS microchannel with outlet, inlet, drain and sample recovery chamber holes and the PDMS substrate were then treated with oxygen plasma (CUTE-MP, UVOTECH Systems, Concord, CA, USA) to increase its adhesion to the PDMS substrate. After assembling the PDMS microchannel and the PDMS substrate, it was heated in oven at 145 \u00b0C for 20 min. Then silicone microtubes with an inside diameter of 1 mm and an outside diameter of 2 mm were assembled into the holes in the PDMS layer to connect the microchannel.",

The PDMS disks in the biopsy punch were reinserted into the holes in the microfluidic chip to act as a pair of switching valves. The valves are opened or closed by rotation of the PDMS disks. This switching valve has the important advantage of being very easy to fabricate. To decrease the risk of leakage from the side of the valve, parylene thin film about 800 nm thick was coated on the side surface of each switching valve by using a dix coating apparatus (DACS-LAB, KISCO, Osaka, Japan). Pressure tests of the valves uncoated and coated with parylene were conducted to demonstrate the utility of the parylene thin film by using a pressure sensor (Pressure Transducers with Amp, Copal Electronics, Tokyo, Japan).",

To purify the virus, the right valve was closed and the left valve was opened, and 100 \u03bcL of a 2.5 \u00d7 105\n pfu/mL NDV suspension which included FBS proteins was introduced into the column through inlet 2. Next, 100 \u03bcL of a 500 mM KCl solution was introduced into the column through inlet 2 to elute the FBS proteins. Finally, the left valve was closed and the right valve was opened, and 100 \u03bcL of a 1 M phosphate buffer was introduced into the column through inlet 2 to elute the viruses. The phosphate buffer was collected at the sample recovery chamber to detect the viruses by hemagglutination reaction [21]. PBS was used as a control for a negative result, and a pure NDV suspension was used as a control for a positive result. For the hemagglutination reaction, blood for the hemagglutination reaction was collected from laboratory volunteers, after obtaining informed consent according to the protocol approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nagoya University. First, blood was pipetted into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and washed with PBS three times. After the final wash the supernatant was aspirated and enough PBS was added to make a working solution of 2% RBCs in PBS. Next, 50 \u03bcL of the working solution was added to each well of a round-bottomed 96-well dish, then 50 \u03bcL of the sample was added to each well and mixed with the working solution. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the negative result appears as a red dot in the center of the round-bottomed plate because the red blood cells settle out, and as shown in Fig. 5(b), the positive result forms a uniform reddish color across the well because each agglutinating molecule on the virus coat binds to multiple red blood cells to form a bridged structure.",

The thermal cycling protocol for real-time RT-PCR was as follows: a cDNA synthesis step at 42 \u00b0C for 5 min, an inactivation RT step at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 s, annealing and extension at 60 \u00b0C for 20 s.

Microcolumns B, C and D in Fig. 8(a) are 1 mm wide. Comparison of microcolumns B and C shows more effective enrichment with microcolumn C due to its longer length, allowing more hydroxyapatite to be packed in it. Comparison of microcolumns C and D shows more effective enrichment with microcolumn C, even though microcolumn C is half the length of D. However, the path in microcolumn D is tortuous while in microcolumn C it is straight. The height equivalence to theoretical plate (HETP) in chromatography increases if the column is tortuous. According to Giddings [24], [25], HETP is inversely proportional to the square of curvature of the column [24], [25], [26]. Therefore the curvature of the column should be infinity for small HETP, so a column should have a straight structure. Microcolumns A, C and E in Fig. 8(b) are equal in volume. Comparison of microcolumn A and C shows more effective enrichment with microcolumn C because it is thinner than microcolumn A. According to Taylor's experiment, the chromatogram has a peak due to diffusion in the column [27], [28]. For more effective elution, the chromatographic peak should be sharp. The width (W) of the chromatographic peak is proportional to the column radius, and the height (H) of the chromatographic peak is inversely proportional to the cube of the column radius. To obtain a sharp peak, W should be small and H should be large. Therefore the column radius should be smaller for more effective chromatography. In our virus enrichment experiments, microcolumn C is thinner than microcolumn A, and thus provides more effective enrichment. More effective enrichment was achieved with microcolumn C than with microcolumn E, even though E is thinner than C, because E has a tortuous shape while microcolumn C is straight.",

Such a simple sample processing unit can be integrated with other units such as extraction of viral RNA and detection of viral subtype on a single microfluidic chip. Viral RNA is specifically adsorbed to silica when the solution contains chaotropic agent such as guanidine salt. The adsorbed RNA can be eluted by low-salt buffer such as nuclease-free water. A silica-packed microcolumn for viral RNA extraction is producible like hydroxyapatite microcolumn of this study. Furthermore, a viral detection could be achieved by immobilizing peptide nucleic acids (PNA) for the viral genome capture to a sample recovery chamber in this microfludic chip. PNA is an RNA/DNA mimic in which the phosphate deoxyribose backbone is replaced by a neutral amide backbone composed of N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine linkage [29], [30]. Base pairing by PNAs is not affected by intrastrand electrostatic repulsion and occurs with high affinity and enhanced rates of association with strict sequence specificity such as virus subtype. Integration of such units on a single microfluidic chip will allow the continuous treatment of the clinical samples in an enclosed region with low risk of contamination and infection to the operators. Therefore, we believe the microfluidic chip presented here has a significant potential for easy and rapid diagnosis of the infectious diseases.",
