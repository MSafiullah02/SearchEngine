We do not sure whether there is some interference from some persons who might read our paper during Otc. 23-Nov. 15, 2012.) SARS-CoV is believed to originate from civets and was thought to have been eliminated as a threat after the 2003 outbreak. Here, we show that human SARS-CoV (huSARS-CoV) originated directly from bats, rather than civets, by a cross-species jump in 1991, and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998. Since then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between humans and civets. Three crucial time points -1991, for the cross-species jump from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and 2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans -were found to associate with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong. Anti-SARS-CoV sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested from Guangzhou children who were born after 2005, suggesting that weakly virulent huSARS-CoVs might still exist in humans. These existing but undetected SARS-CoVs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk for the reemergence of SARS.",

To investigate the origin of SARS-CoV, we constructed a time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using SARS-CoV S gene sequences from humans, civets and bats for inferring the ancestral host state of viruses (Fig. 1) . In the tree, all huSARS-CoVs and pcSARS-CoVs are divided into two sub-clades, one (sub-clade I) containing all 2003 huSARS-CoVs with one exception, and another (sub-clade II) including all pcSARS-CoVs and two huSARS-CoVs. Strains within sub-clades I and II have the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) at nodes D and F, respectively, and share an earlier ancestor at node C. The ancestral host states of MRCAs were estimated to be exclusively human at nodes C, D and F (Fig. 1, left upper panel) , indicating a transmission route from humans to civets [7, 8] . All batSARS-CoVs form two sub-clades. One is located at the most basal position of the tree, and another clusters with the clade comprising huSARS-CoVs and pcSARS-CoVs and shares a MRCA at node B (Fig. 1) . The ancestral host states of MRCAs most likely are bat at both nodes A and B (Fig. 1, left upper panel) , suggesting a cross-species transmission from bats",

Because SARS-CoVs from humans (huSARS-CoV) have a closer phylogenetic relationship with the strains isolated from civets (pcSARS-CoV) than those isolated from bats (batSARS-CoV), civets are naturally recognized as the immediate reservoir of huSARS-CoV [3, 4] . A 29-nucleotide (nt) region, which can be found in the genomes of pcSARS-CoVs and early isolates of huSARS-CoVs but not in the genomes of the intermediate and later isolates of huSARS-CoVs, was used as compelling evidence to support the direct origin of huSARS-CoVs from civets [3, 7, 8] . However, another study demonstrated that the presence of the 29-nt region can not be used as evidence to trace the origin of huSARS-CoVs and argued against the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV from civets to humans [9] .",

These data suggest that SARS-CoV existed among humans prior to the SARS outbreak and raise doubts about the direct origin of huSARS-CoV from civets. What the immediate reservoir of huSARS-CoV is, and when and why it originated, remain to be answered. Furthermore, since the SARS epidemic was well controlled, some experts believe that SARS-CoV has essentially disappeared as a threat. Recently, however, a new strain of coronavirus that causes acute serious respiratory illness similar to SARS appeared in the Middle East [13, 14] . Although this virus has a closer phylogenic relationship with coronaviruses that infect bats in Southeast Asia than with SARS-CoVs [15] , it raises a question as to whether SARS-CoV has been eradicated completely.",

This suggests that the SARS-CoVs of genotype T may be more virulent than those of genotype C. By analyzing the genotypes of SARS-CoVs from two huSARS-CoV-associated sub-clades (I and II), we found that except for two strains at the basal position, all strains within sub-clade I belong to genotype T, suggesting their potential to be highly virulent, and all strains from sub-clade II belong to genotype C, suggesting they may be weakly virulent (Fig. 3) . At the basal position of sub-clade I, one genotype C strain shares characteristics with those in sub-clade II, and another seems to be intermediate between genotypes C and T, implying an evolution from the weakly virulent genotype C strains to the highly virulent genotype T strains. This suggests that after jumping from bats into humans, SARS-CoV evolved into both highly and weakly virulent lineages. Some SARS-CoVs carried the 29-nt deletion, which was previously used as the predominant evidence for cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV from civets to humans [7, 8] . We found that except for one strain at the basal position, all strains within sub-clade I carry the 29-nt deletion, whereas all strains from sub-clade II lack the 29-nt deletion (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, all genotype T strains have the 29-nt deletion, and all genotype C strains appear to lack the 29-nt deletion except one genotype C strain at the basal position of sub-clade I that has the 29-nt deletion (Fig. 3) . These indicate a close association between genotype T and the 29-nt deletion, suggesting that the 29-nt deletion may also be associated with the virulence of SARS-CoV.",

We found that Guangdong experienced the second lowest annual precipitation and a relatively high annual temperature in 1991, which happens to correspond to the time when SARS-CoV started to jump from bats to humans (Fig. 4 ). Since 1991, Guangdong experienced two other times with very low annual precipitation and higher annual temperatures, in 2003 and 2004, well consistent with the time of the outbreak and reemergence of SARS-CoV. This type of climate condition also existed in 1998-1999, corresponding to the time of the appearance of the earliest human-adapted SARS-CoV (Fig. 4) .

One reason is that animals often harbor a variety of viruses, so it's logical to assume that animals are the natural reservoir of a new pathogen. Another reason is the discovery of the 29-nt deletion, which is strong evidence for the transmission of SARS-CoV from civets to humans, since it can be detected among all pcSARS-CoVs and early isolates of huSARS-CoVs, but not among middle and late isolates of huSARS-CoVs [3, 7, 8] . It was well known that civets played crucial role in expanding SARS-CoV transmission during the SARS outbreak [22, 23] . However, if huSARS-CoV indeed originated from civets through cross-species transmission, we are unable to explain why SARS-CoV-specific antibodies were detected among children in Beijing and among adults in Guangdong and Hong Kong before the SARS outbreak (Table 2) [10, 11] , but not among wild civets and animals in Beijing as well as in 12 southeastern provinces of China [4, 12] . Furthermore, Janies, et al clearly demonstrated that the 29-nt deletion does not support the transmission of SARS-CoV from civets to humans, and pointed out that the misleading conclusion drawn by previous studies was ascribed to the lack of an outgroup in previous phylogenetic analyses [9] . These observations imply that the direct origin of huSARS-CoV still remains elusive.",

If the transmission route of SARS-CoV from civets to humans is correct, the host state of the MRCA of all huSARS-CoVs and pcSARS-CoVs should be the civet. The S and RdRp proteins are the two most crucial proteins for SARS-CoV survival [1, 2] . The MCC trees of both the S and RdRp genes consistently show that the ancestral host of all huSARS-CoVs and pcSARS-CoVs is human, rather than civet. The Bayes factor (BF) test, which determines the statistically significant epidemiological linkage (BF>3), supports the transmission of SARS-CoV from humans to civets (BF = 23.73 and 120.38 for S and RdRp genes, respectively). These results, together with the detection of seroprevalence of SARS-CoVs in Beijing [10] , Hong Kong [11] and Guangzhou in 2001 (Table 2) , clearly indicates that the direct origin of huSARS-CoV was not from the civet, rather it was the reverse with pcSARS-CoV originating from humans. All batSARS-CoVs are located outside the clade comprising all huSARS-CoVs and pcSARS-CoVs, implying that the earliest huSARS-CoV most likely evolved from certain batSARS-CoVs. The BF test provides further support for the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV from bats to humans (BF > 3.00 and = 3.38 for S and RdRp genes, respectively). In spite of this, we do not exclude the possibility that there might be intervening hosts involved in the movement of SARS-CoV from bats to humans.",

The first one is that the S protein, which is responsible for viral attachment and entry into cells, must evolve the ability to recognize and use the receptor of different host cells [28] . After overcoming the receptor barriers, the second obstacle is that the replicase RdRp must adapt the intracellular environment of a new host to support productive replication of the viral genome [29] . Thus, the adaptation of the S protein to be able to recognize and bind to the new host receptor must be prior to the adaptation of the RdRp enzyme [28, 29] and, as a result, the estimated time to achieve cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV based on the S gene should be sooner than that based on the RdRp gene. The date estimated for the cross-species jump of SARS-CoV from bats to humans based on the S gene is 1991.6, earlier than the estimated 1997.7 based on the RdRp gene. Regarding the tMRCA of huSARS-CoVs and pcSARS-CoVs, the estimates based on the S and RdRp genes are 1998.6 and 2001.3, respectively, supporting the above presumption that the adaptation of the S protein to human is prior to that of the RdRp enzyme.",

The ability of RdRp to effectively support replication of SARS-CoV in various cell lines confirmed that the adaptation of the RdRp enzyme is not the crucial step that limits the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV [30] . Therefore, it was hypothesized that the S protein must undergo more mutations to overcome the species barrier than the RdRp enzyme does. As expected, comparisons of ancestral protein sequences show that the S protein accumulated 57 amino acid mutations during the adaptation process of SARS-CoV from bat hosts to human hosts, significantly more than the three amino acid mutations that occurred in the RdRp enzyme (P<0.0001, Fisher's exact test) ( Table 1 , and Fig. 2) .",

After the formation of human-adapted strains, SARS-CoV further evolved into two different lineages (sub-clades I and II) (Fig. 1) . From node C to the sub-clade I strains, only one mutation was observed in the S protein, whereas from node C to the sub-clade II strains, a total of four mutations were observed. In particular, among these four mutations, N479K, S480G and T487S can all provide the S protein with the ability to co-utilize palm civet ACE2 for cellular entry of SARS-CoV [17, 28, 33] . These data strongly suggest that civets received the SARS-CoV infections from humans. After cross-species transmission from humans to civets, SARS-CoV could retain the ability to infect humans, which could have significantly contributed to the SARS outbreak by expanding the reservoirs for SARS-CoV transmission [22, 23, 36] .",

Among ten loci determining the SARS-CoV genotype, four (A21721G, C22222T, G22517A, G23823T) are located in the S gene, and none in the RdRp gene, implying that the S protein contributes to SARS-CoV virulence, but the RdRp enzyme does not. Among two huSARS-CoV-associated sub-clades in the S gene MCC, the sub-clade I comprises almost all huSARS-CoVs isolated in 2003, whereas the sub-clade II comprises two huSARS-CoVs and all pcSARS-CoVs isolated during 2003-2004. Except for two strains located at the basal position, all strains within the sub-clade I have genotype T, whereas all sub-clade II strains have genotype C (Fig. 3) . In addition, all genotype T strains carry the 29-nt deletion, and, with one exception, all genotype C strains lack the 29-nt deletion (Fig. 3) . This strongly suggests a close association between the genotype T and the 29-nt deletion, both of which together might determine the virulence of SARS-CoV. This information, together with the epidemiological observations that most 2003 huSARS-CoVs can result in pneumonia in humans [21, 37] and even in civets [38] , and whereas pcSARS-CoVs do not cause pneumonia in civets or other animals [3] , indicates that the strains within sub-clade I are highly virulent and those within sub-clade II are weakly virulent [18] . Interestingly, within sub-clade I, the basal strain has a full genotype C polymorphism map and lacks the 29-nt deletion, and the second basal strain has an intermediate polymorphism pattern between genotypes C and T, and carries the 29nt-deletion (Fig. 3) . Therefore, the MRCA of all sub-clade I strains should belong to genotype C and have the 29-nt sequence. This implies that the highly virulent huSARS-CoVs leading to the SARS outbreak evolved from the weakly virulent strains (Fig. 3) .",

If so, the weakly virulent huSARS-CoVs may have been continuously circulating among humans since 1998.6 through to the present time. They may not be of concern because they cause non-pneumonic or mild infections. The serological data from two retrospective studies supported the presence of the weakly virulent huSARS-CoV strains before 2001 since there were no SARS-associated pneumonia cases reported before the SARS outbreak [10, 11] . Furthermore, another study conducted in Hong Kong showed that even during the SARS outbreak the SARS-CoV-associated non-pneumonic infections were more common than SARS-CoV pneumonia [39] , indicating that weakly virulent huSARS-CoV strains were co-circulating with other highly virulent strains during the SARS outbreak. However, because multiple effective control and intervention measures implemented in China and other countries helped stop the SARS epidemic quickly [40] , some experts optimistically believe that SARS-CoV no longer exists in wildlife and has essentially disappeared as a threat.",

In addition, during 2000-2002, we found that 66.7% of inpatients (including children) in Guangdong were sero-positive for SARS-CoV ( Table 2 ). The serological results most likely reflect the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV and are less likely to be due to cross reactivity of the ELISA kit with other human coronaviruses (huCoVs). Firstly, the microtiter plates (Beijing BGI-GBI Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) used to detect anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were coated with SARS-CoV lysate, which was demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV antibody testing [41] . Secondly, to reduce and/or exclude the possibility of cross reactivity, we randomly selected 271 and 90 samples from 474 children and 274 adults, respectively, in order to test for IgG antibodies against other huCoVs (Table S1) . Among 132 child samples known to be anti-huCoV antibody negative, 26 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. Of particular importance is that among 36 anti-huCoV antibody positive adult samples, none was positive for SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. These results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV lysate ELISA IgG Kit that we used is highly specific for SARS-CoV antibody.",

In particular, the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV occurred in 1991, a year with the lowest annual precipitation levels (an exceptionally dry period) seen in Guangdong in the past three decades. Previous studies showed that low absolute humidity favors the airborne survival and transmission of respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza virus) [42, 43, 44] . Because the data on absolute humidity in Guangdong in the past three decades are not available, we were unable to determine whether change of absolute humidity in Guangdong was associated with the cross-species transmission and outbreak of SARS-CoV. Therefore, whether or not the exceptionally dry climate in Guangdong in 1991 facilitated the airborne survival of batSARS-CoVs and its cross-species transmission from bats to humans deserves further investigation.",

In 1991.6, SARS-CoV began its cross-species jump from bats to humans and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998.6. After moving into human hosts, huSARS-CoVs diverged into highly virulent strains with genotype T and a 29-nt deletion mutation in 2002.1, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C but without the 29-nt deletion in 2000.7 (Fig. 5) . The former strains can cause pneumonia in humans and could be the major causative pathogen of the 2003 SARS outbreak, whereas the latter strains might not cause pneumonia in humans but evolved the ability to co-utilize civet ACE2 as its entry receptor, leading to two waves of interspecies transmission between humans and civets (Fig. 5) . Currently, the weakly virulent huSARS-CoVs may still exist among humans. Of concern is the possibility that they could evolve into highly virulent strains when favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk of the reemergence of SARS [45] . Therefore, routine surveillance for the detection of huSARS-CoVs together with increased attention to climate changes are strongly urged to prevent the reemergence of SARS.",

The evolutionary rates and the times to the most recent common ancestors (tMRCA) of various nodes in the MCC tree were estimated by BEAST. A relaxed molecular clock with an uncorrelated log-normal distribution and a constant population size model were used in the MCMC analyses. The codon-based substitution model (SRD06) was chosen as the nucleotide substitution model. The 95% highest probability density (HPD) was used to reflect the statistical uncertainty in parameter estimates. MCMC analysis was run for at least 1000 million generations, with sampling every 10,000 generations.
