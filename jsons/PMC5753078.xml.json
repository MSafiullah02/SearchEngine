Despite a decrease in incidence due to the advent of the highly active antiretroviral tri-therapy, PCP remains the most common AIDS-defining infection [1,2,3], and is also of clinical importance in HIV-negative patients such as transplant recipients and those receiving chemotherapy for malignant diseases. PCP is in fact the second most frequent life-threatening invasive fungal infection worldwide with an estimated number over 400,000 per year [4].",

In order to develop effective therapies against a pathogen such as P.\njirovecii, this pathogen needs to be efficiently cultured to be studied. Despite generations of microbiologists that tried to establish an efficient culturing system for P. jirovecii, all previous attempts to establish such a system failed. This serious gap could be closed by a novel and potent cell culture system that enable growths and passaging of P. jirovecii. Using an approach that is novel for the field of microbiology, we succeeded in solving this issue. We used novel air-liquid interface cultures that simulate the natural locus of P. jirovecii infection, i.e., the airway epithelia. By using this approach the colleagues were able to grow P. jirovecii, and the number of fungus particles significantly increased [9].",

So far it was assumed that patients of this cohort will solely suffer from an infection with P. jirovecii when being immunosuppressed. Further, there are many HIV-negative patients in whom P. jirovecii DNA was detected at low copy numbers which was believed to reflect the background noise from the high rate of seroprevalence; however, this concept has not been proven and requires additional investigations.",

Consequently, the aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical features of low-titer, subtle P. jirovecii infections in patients without Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

From this cohort of P. jirovecii\u2013positive patients, we extracted exclusively the HIV-negative patients with complete medical records regarding BAL analyses, background history, and antibiotic treatment using the clinical patient information system. Patients were defined as fully immunocompetent if they did not receive immunosuppresive therapy, displayed regular antibody titers, and did not suffer from acquired, inherited or autoimmune diseases. Thirty patients fulfilled the criteria mentioned before and were included in this study. None of these patients showed clinical and radiological signs of Pneumocystis pneumonia. In this cases, initial P. jirovecii testing was requested from lack of alternative diagnoses. In contrast, PCP was defined by increased both-sided opacification in the lower lung, widespread pulmonary infiltrates, shortness of breath, reduced PaO2, and positive PCR and/or microscopy.",

Keeping in mind that both coefficients solely allow us to discriminate between positive or negative correlations but not with the quality of an existing correlation, it could be assumed that at least a (weak) positive correlation exists between a high P. jirovecii copy number in the PCR and the elevation of the CRP levels. Both correlations tested for statistical significance using the SPSS 22 software using the two-sided correlation and significance test. The significance level of the correlation between the copy number and LDH was p = 0.480, the significance level (two sides) of the correlation between the CRP and copy number was p = 0.017; thus, both the correlation between the CRP and copy number was statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval, while the correlation to LDH was not statistically significant.

Due to better nutrition conditions (at least in industrialized countries) and optimized HIV therapies preventing patients from the status of AIDS, the number of lethal PCPs decreased in the past and the fungus was lost from the focus of research, although it still remains a major health problem.

None of these 30 patients with a full documented medical history suffered from clinical or radiological signs of PCP, but all reported recurrent airway infections and chronic cough. Being negatively tested for all important respiratory viruses and bacteria, all patients tested positive for P. jirovecii by qPCR. The titers were approximately 108 mtLSU copies per ml of BAL fluid, which corresponds to a 104\u2013106 lower number of nuclear genomes (i.e., a 105\u2013107 lower number of fungal particles) [9]. Although there is no universal guideline, there is consent that higher P. jirovecii titers are more frequently associated with pneumonia, while lower titers often indicate a milder colonization; however, there is no consent on the cut-off values, nor is there any standardization or consent that clearly discriminates between colonization and infection [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. A novel approach was made by Louis et al., who, for the first time, tried to harmonize the cut-off value, while also addressing the general problem that international standard cut-off values are still missing due to the different targets of qPCR (e.g., mtLSU gene vs. MSG (multicopy surface glycoprotein gene)) [31].",

In future studies it will be necessary to analyze how many detected P. jirovecii cases with low fungal titers are associated with chronic respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the frequency of P. jirovecii colonization needs to be elucidated, as thus far mainly hospitalized patients will be tested for P. jirovecii, but the number of colonized patients in the non-hospitalized cohort may differ. In any case, it should be recommended that in addition to fluorescence-based and classical microscopy, molecular testing should be routinely performed for suspected P. jirovecii infections and colonization, as the classical methods would have missed virtually 100% of our successfully treated patients.",

LDH is elevated with dependence of the copy number, i.e., the more mtLSU copies, the higher the LDH concentration. This effect was not present for CRP. The Pearson coefficient was 0.231, r2 was 0.0534, both indicating a positive statistical correlation. However, the correlation is statistically significant only for CRP but not for LDH.",
