The LAMP assay is rapid and does not require expensive reagents or In conclusion, we report a simple LAMP assay for SARS diagnosis. We believe the inexpensive running costs of the assay make this technology very applicable to laboratories for SARS diagnosis in developing countries. The technique might have great potential to be used in field situations or at the bedside as a preliminary screening test. Regardless of the method used, testing in a suitably accredited laboratory is important, especially during an outbreak, when quality-assured diagnoses are essential.

DNA plasmids containing the target sequences were used as positive controls. To accelerate the amplification reaction, cDNA for the SARS-CoV ORF1b sequence was amplified by a modified LAMP reaction(14 ) in the presence ofsix primers: F3 (5\u0408-CTTAGGATTGCCTACG-3\u0408); B3c (5\u0408-AGTCCAGTTACATTTTCT-3\u0408); FIP (5\u0408-AGTGTGCTGTT-TCAGTAGTGATTCATCACAGGGTT-3\u0408); BIP (5\u0408-TGTA-ATGTCAACCGCTTTGCGACGTGGTATTTC-3\u0408); Loop B (5\u0408-TCTTTATGACAAACTGCAAT-3\u0408); and Loop Fc (5\u0408-TTTGTGTGAATATGACATAGTCATA-3\u0408; see Fig. 1S in the online Data Supplement).
