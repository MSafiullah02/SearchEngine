We noted a very high incidence of RV in pre-HCT samples (61%), predominantly rhinovirus. Despite immunosuppressive treatment of the conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis, no progression to viral pneumonitis occurred. After a median of 8.5 weeks, often coinciding with T-cell immune recovery, 13% of all included patients had respiratory symptoms fitting the diagnostic criteria for allo-LSs. With the limitations of a retrospective cohort study taken into account, our data suggest that detection of RV in BAL fluid (and not from NPAs) before HCT is a strong predictor for the development of allo-LSs in children after HCT. No difference in effect was found between the various viral species detected, nor did we see a relation with the PCR Ct value (as a semiquantitative measure for viral load) of the virus at detection. Grade II to IV aGVHD in another organ occurring earlier in time (median onset after 6 weeks) appears to have a protective effect on the occurrence of allo-LSs, possibly because of earlier initiation of increased immunosuppression. Allo-LSs were treated with high-dose steroids but remained a life-threatening complication; patients with allo-LSs had significantly higher TRM associated with a trend toward lower overall survival. This high TRM warrants novel or additional treatment in prospective trials; etanercept is one of the agents suggested by others, although conflicting data exist.12, 13 Identification of high-risk patients, preventive strategies, and awareness and early detection of allo-LSs could lead to improved survival chances.",

However, in all patients BAL was done through a tracheal tube some time after intubation, reducing the risk of direct contamination. Moreover, we have not found any difference in Ct values between NPAs and BAL fluid, and therefore contamination seems unlikely (because one would expect a much higher Ct value and lower viral load when contaminated). If some positive BAL samples were contaminated, the suggested association between BAL fluid RV and allo-LSs would be even stronger. An important note is that during the study period, as it became clear there was an association between RV positivity in NPAs and allo-LSs,6 we started taking preventive measures in the patients with positive NPA RV results by postponing HCT, prolongation of immunosuppressive therapy, or both. This might have influenced the study outcomes and could have led to the observed decrease in the incidence of allo-LSs over time.",

The fact that we have pre-HCT, presymptomatic BAL samples gives new insight in this discussion. We show that an RV could be present for weeks (to months) before pulmonary symptoms occur. This is despite the fact that the patients are severely immunocompromised. In an era of more precise detection tools (eg, PCR), it is not surprising that certain disease (exclusion) criteria are subject to changes. Therefore we have allowed RV PCR positivity in the definition of allo-LSs.",

This concept fits the current understanding of alloimmunity after HCT, where host antigen-presenting cells are activated by danger signals expressed on damaged tissues, pathogens, or both, leading to alloactivation and cytokine release and inducing a cycle of inflammation and tissue damage.24, 25, 26 Therefore further studies on the influence of the microbiome/viriome on the development of alloreactive immune phenomena after HCT are of great interest. In line with this, in patients with an inborn error of metabolism, which was found to be a borderline predictor for IPS, storage of glycosaminoglycans in the lungs can lead to low-grade inflammation and activation of antigen-presenting cells as well.",

The presence of a pathogen was associated with mortality, even for pathogens with uncertain pulmonary pathogenicity, such as rhinovirus. They reconsidered the diagnosis, suggesting viral pneumonitis instead of IPS, and pointed out the possible harmful effect of high-dose steroids in case of detectable pathogens. This is in contrast with the interpretation of our findings. An important difference with our study is that Seo et al have no information on the RV status of the patients before they experience IPS.",

Therefore we believe that it is not the RV itself that causes the respiratory deterioration but the inflammatory response (similar to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in patients with HIV/AIDS). Timing of symptoms, protection by immunosuppressive therapy (in case of GVHD), and initial response to an increase in immunosuppression support our hypothesis of a primary immune-mediated process. On the basis of these results, we would recommend thorough screening of all pre-HCT patients with chest HRCT and BAL in search of fungal infection but also for RV as a predictor for allo-LSs. In case of RV positivity, we would advise slower tapering of immune suppression after HCT and close monitoring for respiratory symptoms during follow-up with prompt diagnostics and treatment when an allo-LS is suspected.",

Further studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying alloimmune phenomena in different target organs after HCT and to determine a role for the respiratory microbiome. Recognizing BAL fluid RV positivity before HCT as a predictor for allo-LSs might have clinical implications for prevention (by adapting immune suppressive prophylaxis) and (pre-emptive) therapy. Early recognition might also lead to improved survival chances.Clinical implicationsIn children positive RV results in BAL fluid before HCT predisposes to allo-LSs. Screening is important because prevention and treatment of allo-LSs is based on either prolonged or increased immune suppression.\n",
