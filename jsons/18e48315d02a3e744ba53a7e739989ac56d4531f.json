To estimate the degree of variation in mutation rates of RNA viruses and to understand the source of such variation, we studied the synonymous substitution rate because synonymous substitution is exempt from functional constraints at the protein level, and its rate reflects the mutation rate to a great extent. We estimated the synonymous substitution rates for a total of 49 different species of RNA viruses, and we found that the rates had tremendous variation by 5 orders of magnitude (from 1.3 3 10 27 to 6.2 3 10 22 /synonymous site/year). Comparing the synonymous substitution rates with the replication frequencies and replication error rates for the RNA viruses, we found that the main source of the rate variation was differences in the replication frequency because the rates of replication error were roughly constant over different RNA viruses. Moreover, we examined a relationship between viral life strategies and synonymous substitution rates to understand which viral life strategies affect replication frequencies. The results show that the variation of synonymous substitution rates has been influenced most by either the difference in the infection modes or the differences in the transmission modes.

Infection modes are classified into acute, persistent, and latent infection. In general, the infection modes are not mutually exclusive. In fact, some viruses have both of acute and persistent infection phases. For example, measles viruses induce acute infection in the beginning, and maintain a persistent phase in the same host. When the replication of a virus is strictly limited, by some reasons, in the persistent phases, this infection mode is called latent infection. The viral transmissions were composed of six modes, i.e., aerosol transmission, contagious transmission, fecal-oral route transmission, transmission via blood (sexual relationship and artificial injection), transmission via a bite, and transmission via a vector. First, we compared the infection modes with the rates of synonymous substitution. The results showed that the rates of synonymous substitution for viruses inducing both acute and persistent infection were higher than those for viruses inducing only acute infection. We also showed that the rates of synonymous substitution for viruses of only acute infection were higher than those for the viruses of only persistent infection and that the rates of synonymous substitution for viruses of only persistent infection were higher than those for the viruses of latent infection.

Thus, we reasonably assume that the highest replication frequency is manifested by the viruses inducing both acute and persistent infection, the second highest by viruses inducing only acute infection, the third by viruses inducing only persistent infection, and the fourth by the viruses inducing latent infection. In fact, the rate of synonymous substitution for the viruses inducing both acute and persistent infection is the highest, that for the viruses inducing only acute infection is the second highest, that for the viruses inducing only persistent infection is the third, and that for the viruses inducing latent infection is the fourth.

This indicated that the transmission mode affected the replication frequency and that differences in the replication frequencies contributed to the variation of the rate of synonymous substitution for RNA viruses. In fact, there was a good example in which a change of transmission mode seriously affected the evolutionary rate (Salemi et al. 1999 ).
