Although mortality post transplantation has decreased with modern surgical techniques and pharmaceutical regimes, 5\u2010year mortality has been reported to be around 50%, of which infections are the predominant cause of death during the first year post LTx.1 The constant exposure to the environment through inhaled microorganisms together with denervation, reduced ciliary transport and decreased cough, increase the risk of lung infections. Moreover, heavy immunosuppressive therapy leads to decreased immune defense. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), including microbiological cultures and PCR, are performed in lung transplant patients for surveillance and in response to clinical symptoms to guide antibiotic therapy. As the microbiological panorama differs by geographical region, especially with regards to multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR), it is important to map the local epidemiology. Previous studies of microbiology in lung transplant patients have focused on infections rather than the total panorama of microbiological findings.2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Moreover, most studies of lung infections in lung transplant patients are single center reports with a small number of patients. In Sweden, LTx is performed at two centers only, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Lund and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg. The primary aim of this nationwide prospective study was to examine the microbiological panorama in BALF of lung transplant patients in Sweden during the first\u2010year post transplantation and to compare findings in patients with and without signs of lung infection.",

BAL procedure followed standardized protocols. Microbiology analyses were performed at the Microbiological Department, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital and Sahlgrenska University Hospital according to standard protocols.7, 8 All BALF samples were analyzed with bacterial and fungal cultures, including microscopy for fungal elements and PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa was defined as resistance against meropenem and at least one agent in three or more categories of anti\u2010pseudomonal antibiotics. The definition is based on criteria published by Magiorakos et al9, with the modification that resistance against meropenem had to be present. A panel of airway viruses was analyzed with multiplex PCR, including; Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Influenza A and B, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus (OC 43, 229E, NK\u201063, HKU1), Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus.10 In Lund, additional PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 was performed with an in\u2010house method. Presence of Pneumocystis jiroveci was analyzed with PCR11 or immunofluorescence of BALF. CMV in blood or plasma was determined with quantitative PCR. All BALF samples from Lund were routinely stained and cultured for mycobacteria. BALF samples from Gothenburgh were analyzed for mycobacteria when there was a pretransplant history of mycobacterial infection.",

We found that 85% of patients had samples with positive microbiologic finding(s), and only 15% of patients remained negative throughout their bronchoscopies. In line with our findings, Charlson et al13 found that lung transplant recipients have a higher bacterial burden in BALF than healthy control subjects, regardless of underlying indication for transplantation. The single most common bacterium was P. aeruginosa, both overall and in samples with signs of lung infection. P. aeruginosa is previously well described as an important pathogen in lung transplanted patients.2, 5, 14 Not surprisingly, P. aeruginosa, and other Gram\u2010negative bacteria, were significantly more frequent in patients with cystic fibrosis.

In addition, we lack information about concomitant antimicrobial treatment that may interfere with microbiological results, as well as how treatment of specific pathogens influences the clinical outcome. About half of the patients with signs of lung infection had a previous bronchoscopy with the same microbe found in BALF, suggesting that the microbiology results of a previous bronchoscopy could guide antibiotic treatment in about half of the cases.

The frequency of MDR bacteria was low in our study, indicating that empiric therapy does not need to include MDR bacteria at present in Sweden.
