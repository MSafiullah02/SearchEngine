Elderly patients are most affected; that is, influenza-related deaths, hospitalizations and use of health services are recorded mostly for patients >65 years of age [2, 3]. The virus can spread particularly rapidly in care homes, potentially affecting 60% of residents [4]. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of influenza is essential for identification of contagious patients and effective management of cases of influenza. Management decisions regarding infection control, referral to specialized units, use of additional diagnostic procedures and administration of antiviral therapy have to be made at the point of first contact with the patient. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir are highly effective against influenza A and B viruses, but must be administered as soon as possible, at least within the first 48 h after the onset of the acute respiratory disease, to be effective [5, 6].",

However, studies that revealed a clearly lower sensitivity of these assays included samples from all age groups [11, 12]. Thus, it was suspected that the patient\u2019s age may influence the detection rates achieved by near-patient assays. It was therefore the aim of the present study to evaluate in parallel several different near-patient assays by testing respiratory specimens from both children and adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection.",

The inclusion criterion for the DINOE is an influenza-like illness (acute onset of fever with respiratory and constitutional symptoms) and that for the RNW is the clinical diagnosis of an acute respiratory tract infection including rhinitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. These two surveillance systems include patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections. Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken by experienced physicians, with a swab being taken from both the nose and the throat of the patients. The swab content is tranferred into 1000 \u00fcL of transport medium consisting of minimal essential medium (MEM) (GIBCO; Life Technologies, Lofer, Austria) and discarded thereafter. All clinicians participating in the two surveillance systems were provided with transport medium by the Clinical Institute of Virology, Medical University of Vienna. Immediately after delivery, the clinical samples were vortexed vigorously, diluted in MEM (1 : 2), and split into aliquots before being screened for influenza A and B viruses by virus isolation or RT-PCR, or both.",

Samples were frozen at \u201370\u00b0C and thawed only once for the present investigation. Only samples collected from patients younger than 10 years or older than 35 years were included. The separation of patients into these two age groups was done for practical reasons. In the two surveillance networks DINOE and RNW, the highest consultation rates were observed in patients younger than 10 years or older than 35 years during the influenza season. The aim was therefore to optimize the project for the comparative assessment of near-patient assays in these age groups.

Clinical specimens from 194 patients were included for the evaluation of the four assays. The volume of the 194 samples was not sufficient for testing by all four assays.

The mean age of the children was 4.6 years (standard deviation (SD), 2.9 years) and that of the adults was 57.6 years (SD, 15.9 years). Seven of these patients were younger than 1 year and 20 were older than 80 years.

As shown in Fig. 1\n, the sensitivity of the three more sensitive assays decreased with increasing age of the patients, whereas the low sensitivity of the Quick S-Influ A/B assay was constant throughout all ages, from young children to elderly patients. The estimated probability of detecting influenza A virus in clinical specimens that tested positive according to RT-PCR was 17\u201356% in children 1 year of age, and decreased to 8\u201322% in patients 80 years of age.

A trend for lower sensitivity in adults was observed also for the Binax Now Influenza A&B.",

The low sensitivity of near-patient assays for the diagnosis of influenza, in comparison to virus isolation or RT-PCR, does not allow a reliable exclusion of the diagnosis of influenza. The present study supports the belief that antiviral therapy and additional diagnostic procedures should not be withheld in cases where influenza is clinically suspected on the basis of a negative near-patient assay, particularly in adult patients. On the other hand, the high specificity of near-patient assays, together with the advantage of results being available within 30 min, may provide important information for the clinical evaluation of patients with an acute respiratory illness, provided that the result of the near-patient assay is positive.",

Highly effective antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza but must be administered within 48 h after onset of the disease and are effective only against influenza viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus co-circulates frequently with influenza viruses, causing a significant disease burden also in elderly patients, and the clinical features are difficult to distinguish from those of influenza [18]. The usefulness of near-patient assays is particularly low in the elderly. As a consequence, a considerable number of patients are treated unnecessarily and ineffectively with antiviral or antibacterial drugs, or are exposed to radiation due to additional diagnostic procedures. Therefore, the importance of annual vaccination against influenza, for elderly patients and their care-givers, cannot be overemphasized [19].",

The results of previous evaluations of near-patient assay sensitivity, with regard to patient age, were discordant. Fader [12] noted a clear decrease in assay sensitivity with increasing age, whereas Weinberg and Walker [20] did not, although both studies evaluated the same assay (Binax Now; Binax Inc., Portland, ME, USA). The respiratory specimens used were heterogeneous (nasal washes, nasal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages) and differed between the two studies. In adults, nasal washes are more convenient to collect than nasopharyngeal aspirates, but a diluting effect is inherent in this technique of sample collection and results in lower detection rates [20]. The strength of the present study is the use of comparable samples; all clinical specimens were collected with an identical technique by experienced and well-trained physicians, with the use of a standardized sampling kit. Furthermore, in vitro evaluation of near-patient assay sensitivity with the use of virus stock preparations could be confirmed by determination of the influenza A/H3N2 virus RNA concentrations in clinical samples. These features reduce the potential for bias and support the notion that the findings can be generalized.",

Only samples positive for influenza A/H3N2 viruses were tested, for the purpose of standardization, and conclusions cannot be drawn concerning the sensitivity of near-patient assays for influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses. In the present study, the in vitro sensitivity of near-patient assays differed for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B viruses. Direct comparison of the in vitro sensitivities of near-patient assays with that of RT-PCR has to be made with caution, because of the use of cell culture-grown influenza strains. Cell culture preparations contain a considerable amount of defective virus particles. Different structures of these particles may be detected by use of near-patient assays and RT-PCR, and degradation of virus particles follows different kinetics in cell culture than in the human host. Furthermore, the assay was evaluated retrospectively in a virological laboratory, as in most previous studies [20, 21]. The laboratory setting allows a more standardized inter-assay comparison, but transfer of respiratory secretions into the medium used for preservation of virus and solubilization of mucus adds a dilution step that may reduce the detection rates achievable with near-patient assays. In the present investigation, preservation of nasopharyngeal swabs in transport medium resulted in a final dilution of one log titre. This dilution effect cannot explain the differences in sensitivity observed between age groups or the differences among the four near-patient assays. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of near-patient assays for the diagnosis of influenza A/H3N2 virus infections may be expected to be somewhat higher when bedside testing is performed.",
