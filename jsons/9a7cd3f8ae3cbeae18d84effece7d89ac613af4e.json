Alphaviruses mentioned on the CDC list (such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus) are currently not considered to be agents of major concern in Germany. Another difference is the listing of food and water safety threats on the CDC list, such as Salmonella , E. coli and Shigella species. Furthermore, the CDC list includes emerging pathogens which are often omitted from bio-threat lists.

ZBS3 works on microbial toxins, including research on their pathogenesis.

It offers civilian and military researchers as well as medical and political stakeholders from all over the world a scienti fi c forum to exchange actual assessments of biological risks and threats, perspectives and developments in diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and anti-epidemic management of diseases caused by pathogens of concern, and reconnaissance and veri fi cation of unusual events. Here, the results of the full range of applied research and development of the BMVg at the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology and the WIS are presented.
