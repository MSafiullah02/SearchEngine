We compared the KCDC data to the RV PCR data of adult patients who visited a tertiary care center. During a period of 108 weeks, a total of 6955 (5598 pediatric and 1257 adult) patients underwent RV PCR tests for ARI; most of these tests were administered while the patients were admitted (n = 6,920; 99.5%). From the KCDC website, we collected the RV PCR test results of 22 540 patients. Three graphs of weekly positivity rates were made for adults, children, and the KCDC data per each RV, and these graphs were then compared with one another. Whereas RV outbreaks were coincident between the KCDC and the adult graph with respect to influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus, the same was not true for human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. However, a negative predictive value of the KCDC data in the prediction of the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult graph was high for the respective eight RVs (85-100%).

In current clinical practice, without the routine performance of RV PCR tests for adult patients with ARI, a national or regional laboratory RV surveillance database may be a useful adjunct to that end. The use of such datasets in clinical practice is already well-accepted for IFV, which causes massive outbreaks in both children and adults throughout the community, leading to serious symptoms in some. 6 Based on a national surveillance influenza dataset, the Korean The system was organized by the KCDC nearly two decades ago. 7 After several revisions, the system now includes 200 sentinel sites throughout the country, including data on primary care clinics for pediatrics (n = 100), internal medicine (n = 71), and family medicine (n = 29). Each sentinel site provides weekly reports of the number of patients who present with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) among those evaluated at KCDC sentinel sites. Of these, 36 also provide respiratory specimens from patients with ARI (laboratory sentinel site).

Second, we examined whether the occurrence of an outbreak in the KCDC graph in a given week could predict that in the adult graph in the same week. An outbreak of any RV was regarded to occur at a given week if the detection rate of the RV was >3% during that week. The detection rate of 3% was selected because most of the RV outbreaks in our data began just after the weekly detection rate went up over the value.

IFV was the virus most commonly detected in the adult patients, followed by RHV, RSV, and hMPV. RHV was the virus most commonly detected in the pediatric patients, followed by RSV, ADV, and PIV. RHV was the most common virus in the KCDC data, followed by IFV, PIV, and ADV. Of the three dataset, the mean weekly positivity rate was highest among pediatric patients for most of the RVs, with the exception of IFV, which was highest in the KCDC data (Table 1) . Regarding IFV, RSV, hMPV, and hCoV, the outbreaks represented in the three graphs were consistent with one another. However, in the graphs representing outbreak trends for RHV and ADV, the temporal trends were not as consistent across the datasets as they were for the other RVs ( Figure 2 ). The numbers of hBoV-positive and PIV-positive tests were very small among adult patients (Table 1 ) and positive cases occurred only sporadically ( Figure 2 ). Thus, for these two RVs, comparison among the three graphs was difficult. Table 2 presents the relationship between the KCDC graph and the adult or pediatric graph as well as the predictabilities of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult or pediatric data. A statistically significant correlation between the KCDC data and adult data was observed with respect to IFV, RSV, hMPV, and hCoV.

Our study results strongly support the clinical use of the national laboratory surveillance data during the outbreak of IFV, regarding that the correlation Table 1 ), a similar correlation would likely be observed for these two RVs. Furthermore, we should pay attention to the fact that the NPVs of the KCDC data for the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult data were high regarding all eight RVs. In other words, for each of the eight RVs, an occurrence of no outbreak in the KCDC data may be predictive of an occurrence of no outbreak of the respective RV among adult hospitalized patients. If one of these RVs was frequently detected in a hospital or any locale in a manner not consistent with its prevalence in the KCDC data, we might suspect that hospital or local RV outbreaks were ongoing separate from community outbreaks.

In other words, the pediatric graph may be an inflated form of the KCDC graph, whereas the adult graph may represent a deflated form of the KCDC graph.
