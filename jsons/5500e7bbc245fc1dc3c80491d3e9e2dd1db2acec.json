The goal of the present study was therefore to assess whether male patients with COVID-19 infection show more extensive lung involvement than female patients.",

Male vulnerability to COVID-19 may, in part, be explained by a gender disparity in behaviour with men more likely than women to engage in unhealthy habits such as smoking and their poorer and less timely use of medical advice 4 . Additionally, biological differences in the immune response may result in differential susceptibility of males and females to infectious diseases (e.g., animal studies have suggested a protective effect of oestrogen against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], a virus closely related to SARS-CoV 2) 5,6 . These results may advance our understanding of the epidemiological differences in patient outcome. This study was limited by a lack of information on whether this more extensive lung involvement on chest CT correlated with a more adverse clinical outcome during follow-up. ",
