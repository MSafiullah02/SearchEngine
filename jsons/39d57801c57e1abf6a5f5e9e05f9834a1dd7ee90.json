            "text": "The potential for infection by coronaviruses (CoVs) has become a serious concern with the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the human population. CoVs encode two large polyproteins, which are then processed into 15-16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that make significant contributions to viral replication and transcription by assembling the RNA replicase complex. Among them, nsp9 plays an essential role in viral replication by forming a homodimer that binds single-stranded RNA. Thus, disrupting nsp9 dimerization is a potential anti-CoV therapy. However, different nsp9 dimer forms have been reported for alpha-and beta-CoVs, and no structural information is available for gamma-CoVs. Here we determined the crystal structure of nsp9 from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a representative gamma-CoV that affects the economy of the poultry industry because it can infect domestic fowl. IBV nsp9 forms a homodimer via interactions across a hydrophobic interface, which consists of two parallel alpha helices near the carboxy terminus of the protein. The IBV nsp9 dimer resembles that of SARS-CoV nsp9, indicating that this type of dimerization is conserved among all CoVs. This makes disruption of the dimeric interface an excellent strategy for developing anti-CoV Protein Data Bank Accession Codes: The Atomic coordinate and structure factors of IBV nsp9 were submitted to RCSB Protein Data Bank, with accession code 5C94.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] Although progress has been made in limiting CoV infection over the past decade, scientists and physicians still lack a complete understanding of CoV pathogenicity, particularly from the molecular and structural points of view. On the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis, CoVs can be divided into four distinct genera, termed alpha-, beta-, gamma-and delta-CoVs. 10 In the past, human CoV infections have all resulted from alpha-and beta-CoVs (i.e., SARS and MERS are beta-CoVs), with no cases involving gamma-or delta-CoVs repreted so far. However, the risk of cross-species infection from gamma and delta genera should not be ignored, and research concerning these two genera is critical to enable quick and efficient responses to novel animal-to-human CoV infections in the future.",

            "text": "Avian IBV is a gamma-CoV that causes a highly contagious disease in domestic fowl. As such, avian IBV is one of the primary sources of economic loss in the poultry industry. 11 New viral serotypes continue to emerge due to viral mutation and recombination, making this virus very difficult to control. 12 The genome of IBV consists of single-stranded, positivesense RNA that is 27.6 kb in length. 13 Upon infection, viral replicase proteins are translated from the genomic RNA, initially generating two precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins are then processed into 15 individual nonstructural proteins (nsp2-16) by two virus-encoded proteinases, 3C-like and papain-like proteinases. 14, 15 These nsps assemble into a replicase complex responsible for viral transcription and replication. 16 To understand the molecular mechanisms of IBV replication, great effort has been made to characterize nsp structures. To date, only a few nsp structures from IBV have been determined, including nsp2a, the ADRP (adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1 00 -phosphatase) domain of nsp3, and nsp5 main protease (PDB:3LD1,3EWO, 3EJF,3EKE,4X2Z). [17] [18] [19] Nsp9 is essential for viral infection, as its deletion halts virus propagation. 20 Nsp9 is a member of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding (OB)-fold superfamily and a variety of methods have been used to show that nsp9 can bind both RNA and DNA. 21, 22 Interestingly, nsp9 forms a homodimer, and its dimeric form is believed to be critical for RNA binding and for viral infection. The dimeric structure of nsp9 for SARS-CoV was first reported by Egloff et al. 21 They observed that the nsp9 dimer is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between two parallel a-helices (we call this Form-A). The SARS-CoV nsp9 contains a protein-protein association motif \"GXXXG\" (residues G100-G104) on the parallel a-helices of the nsp9 dimer. 23, 24 Mutation of a single residue (G104E) within this motif terminates viral assembly in vivo. This mutation may alter the a-helical interaction and disrupt nsp9 dimerization. 25 This indicates that the dimeric form of nsp9 is essential for viral infection and also suggests that the disruption of nsp9 dimerization may be an effective strategy for combating CoV-associated diseases. Although Form A seems to be the proper dimeric form of nsp9, other researchers have observed two different nsp9 dimers. Sutton et al. also solved the SARS-CoV nsp9 structure, confirming that it forms a dimer in two different space groups. 22 However, they also described a different dimer for SARS-CoV nsp9, which is formed by an interaction between b-strands (b5)-one from each subunit (we call this Form-B). Later, Ponnusamy et al. determined the nsp9 structure for HCoV-229E, revealing a third homodimeric form (Form-C), which is formed via interactions between two anti-parallel a-helices, with a disulfide-linkage between the two Cys69s within the interacting helices. 26 This structure formed a trimer of dimers in the crystal, which is also different from the two structures previously determined for SARS-CoV nsp9. These observations raise an important question; whether there is a common and conserved dimeric form for all CoV nsp9s, or whether there are different dimeric forms for diferent CoV nsp9s. Moreover, no structural information is available for nsp9s of other CoV genera (particularly gamma-CoVs). It is important to determine which type of dimer these nsp9s form, and whether there is structural and functional conservation among these nsp9s from different CoV genera.",

The homodimeric interface was formed by two parallel a-helices, which was further surrounded by a hydrophobic shell. The residues involved in this hydrophobic interaction are conserved across species, suggesting that nsp9 homodimerization in Form A is essential for all CoVs. We further characterized six conserved residues within the dimeric interface of IBV nsp9 by site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical approaches, and found that residues F73, I95, and G98 were critical for both dimerization and RNA interactions.",

This large range in conservation is notable, as nsp9 is crucial for viral replication and therefore a higher level of conservation was expected. Two features account for this variation. First, there are two main gaps in the nsp9 alignment (i.e., stretches of little sequence identity) located at loops connecting bstrands b1-b2 and b4-b5, based upon solved nsp9 structures. Second, the low similarity of pairwise sequence alignment was mainly derived from Beluga Whale CoV (similarity ranged from 24.8% to 56.8%). However, the C-terminal halves of nsp9 proteins (residues 67-111), which include b-strands b6-b7 and helix a1, displayed much higher sequence similarity than the rest of the proteins [ Fig. 1(C) ].

The main chains of the ahelices are very close to each other, as the distance between vectors in the center of each helix is only 5.8 \u00c5 (calculated by PyMOL 31 script \"helix_angle.py\", written by Dr. Robert L. Campbell, Queen's University) . These two a-helices are surrounded by a hydrophobic interface composed of residues from b-strands b2-b3 and b6-b7, and an N-terminal loop from each nsp9 protomer. This dimeric form resembles the SARS-CoV nsp9 dimer. However, the total buried surface area in the IBV nsp9 dimer is 668 \u00c5 2 (calculated by PyMOL), which is smaller than seen for the SARS-CoV nsp9 dimer (903 \u00c5 2 ) (PDB code: 1QZ8) 21 (Supporting Information Table S2 ), but is similar to that of HCoV-229E (693 \u00c5 2 ) and larger than the minimum value (368 \u00c5 2 ) of homodimeric interface reported by Jones S. 32 Site-directed mutagenesis of the nsp9 dimerization interface does not affect nsp9 secondary structure",

However, the results from this study were not very clear, although a decreased dimeric portion for mutant G98D was observed with wild-type nsp9 (Supporting Information Fig. S4 and Table S7) The failure of the second method to give a consistent result may be because it is influenced by a number of factors, such as pH, temperature, concenteations of reactants,etc., and generally hard to control. Since the above two commonly used methods did not give us a clear and consistent conclusion, we continued pursuing more sensitive and quantitative approaches. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used as a third way. It verified the molechular weight of all recombinant proteins.However, mixtures of dimers and monomers were detected in all samples (Supporting Information Table S4 and Fig. S5 ), indicating that the dimer and monomer forms may be in an equilibrium. This also implied that ESI-MS is such a sensitive technique that even a tiny fraction of any oligomeric state can be detected.We further adopted analytical ultracentrifugation,which is a method not widely available but mor accurate, to precisely characterize the monomer-dimer equilibrium for wild-type and mutant nsp9 (F73G, L86G, F88G, I95D, G98D, and G102D) (Supporting Information Fig. S6 and Table  S5 ). Sedimentation coefficients for the F73G, G98D, and I95D mutants revealed that these proteins are less able to form a dimer than the wild-type protein, and therefore tend to remain in the monomeric state. The other mutants (L86G, F88G, and G102D) had oligomerization states similar to wild-type nsp9. These data imply that F73 (from the hydrophobic surface), as well as I95 and G98 (from a1) are more important for IBV nsp9 dimerization than the other tested positions (L86, F88, and G102).",

The first approach was biolayer interferometry (BLI). In this assay, biotinylated RNA was immobilized on streptavidin biosensor tips 34,35 and nsp9 was added at various concentrations (6.25-100 lM) to establish association and dissociation rates [ Fig.  4(C,D) ]. The BLI data provided an overall affinity value (K d ) of 28 lM for the interaction between wild-type nsp9 and RNA. These biosensor binding data also showed that the F73G, G98D, and I95D mutants could not bind RNA [ Fig. 4(D) ]. These data suggest that the dimeric form of nsp9 is required for nsp9-RNA interactions. The second method we used was surface plasmon resonance (SPR), 21 which is also a chip-based immobilized affinity detection technique similar to BLI, but using a different detector. Using SPR, we measured wild-type nsp9-RNA binding affinity at 3.6 lM, very similar to the data from BLI measurements [Supporting Information ",

IBV is a representative gamma-CoV that affects the economy of the poultry industry by infecting domestic fowl. We determined IBV nsp9 structure and found that its monomer resembled those reported for nsp9s from SARS-CoV (PDB code: 1UW7) 22 and HCoV-229E (PDB code: 2J97). 26 In addition, IBV nsp9 formed a Form-A dimer similar to SARS-CoV nsp9. The region forming the dimer interface of nsp9 is highly conserved based on sequence alignment and structural analysis. This strongly supports the hypothesis that there is a conserved dimeric form among nsp9s of all CoVs. As such, designing ways to disrupt nsp9 dimerization (a potential anti-viral strategy) may be quite straightforward, as only the conserved dimeric interface must be considered. This strategy may also be quite powerful, for it may work against all of these CoVs. To facilitate the developent of this potential antiviral strategy, we further characterized six conserved residues (F73, L86, F88, I95, G98, and G102) associated with the dimeric interface and the conserved hydrophobic region. We used site-directed mutagenesis and diverse biophysical and biochemical approaches. We found that three conserved residues (F73, I95, and G98) are critical for stabilizing the dimeric conformation of nsp9 and for nsp9 to bind RNA.",

This dimeric model has been seen in three different crystal structures of nsp9, including SARS-CoV nsp9, and 229E-CoV nsp9 C69A mutant (PDB code: 2J98, 1UW7, 1QZ8) (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ). 21, 22, 26 Form-B, which is seen with interactions between b sheets of the SARS-CoV nsp9 dimer, was not found in the IBV nsp9 dimeric structure because the IBV nsp9 b5s are too far from each other. For Form-B, the lack of sequence conservation in the critical protein region, and the small interaction surface, make it unlikely that Form-B is a conserved dimeric conformation of CoV. Form-C, which is seen in 229E-CoV nsp9 wildtype dimers, is characteristic of a novel disulfidelinked homodimer formed by two antiparallel ahelixes. Noticeably, Cys69 is conserved in nsp9s of alpha-, beta-and gamma-CoVs (including IBV and SARS-CoV). However, this disulfide bond is not observed in IBV and SARS nsp9 dimeric structures. Based on our results, we propose that the dimeric Form-A conformation is the universal state for the nsp9 dimer.",

To investigate the possibility that IBV nsp9 dimerization could be prevented by a single mutation in the a-helix, three conserved residues (I95, G98, and G102) involved in the helixhelix association were mutated. All three nsp9 mutants (I95D, G98D, and G102D) exhibited a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation and ESI-MS. This implies that each point mutation lessened the degree of nsp9 dimerization, but did not completely eliminate it. This is particularly true for the I95 and G98 nsp9 mutants. Therefore, nsp9 homodimerization may be disrupted by targeting conserved residues within the helix-helix interface. These data provide further evidence that the Form-A conformation is the common state of nsp9 dimers. Zachary et al. also showed that mutations to the a-helix in SARS-CoV nsp9 were lethal to the virus. 25 Although the same mutations would presumably affect the interaction between the C-terminal a-helices in both Forms A and C, because Form C involves a disulfide bridge which is uncommon to nsp9s in four CoV genera, we consider that Form-A state of nsp9 is biologically relevant.",

Each mutant displayed a delayed elution peak by gel-filtration chromatography, when compared with wild-type nsp9. Among the mutated proteins, F73G nsp9 was very rarely in a dimeric form, as measured by analytical ultracentrifuge. From these data, we infer that the hydrophobic shell helps stabilize the nsp9 dimer.

Thus, we further analyzed the interaction between nucleic acids and the different forms of nsp9. EMSAs revealed that wild-type and F73G nsp9s could associate with both single-stranded DNA and RNA. The G98D and I95D mutants could not bind nucleic acids, indicating that the residues near the GXXXG motif (within the Cterminal a-helix) are critical for RNA binding. These data conflict with Zachary et al., who performed Non-Radioactive EMSAs after cross-linking nucleic acidprotein mixtures at 254nm by UV-light and showed that each of the SARS-CoV nsp9 wild-type and mutants (G100E, G104E, and G104V) SARS-CoV was able to bind RNA. 25 However, disrupting the nsp9 dimer did result in a 5-to 12-fold decrease in affinity by FA measurements. 25 These conflicting data could be explained by the relatively low-affinity binding constants, and suggests that nsp9 may not have a specific binding sequence, although interactions with a stem-loop in the 3 0 region of the genome were reported recently. 25, 37 To obtain kinetic information and to quantitatively compare the ability of wild-type and mutant versions of nsp9 to bind RNA, we performed BLI and SPR experiments. Although wild-type nsp9 showed a strong RNA-binding signal, the single-residue mutants (F73G, I95D, and G98D) exhibited dramatically decreased signals. This indicates that the dimeric nsp9 state is required for RNA binding, a conclusion supported by both BLI and SPR measurements.",

RNA residues with phosphorothioate linkages (the last two residues on the 3 0 terminus, labeled *) were resistant to nuclease. To detect the weak affinity between nsp9 and RNA, a modified zone interference gel electrophoresis was used. Oligonucleotide RNA (5 0 -CGACUCAUGGACCUUGGC*A*G-3 0 , Takara) and single-strand DNA (5 0 -CGACTCATGGACCTTGGCAG-3 0 , TsingKe) were dissolved at a concentration of 3 nmol before loading onto a 1% agarose gel. The gel was run for 60 min with running buffer (20 mM MOPS, 2 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) at 100 mA, 48C. With the poles of the electrodes interchanged, 1.5 nmol nsp9 protein was loaded and run for another 60 min. The nucleic acids in the gels were stained with gel view (BioTeke) for 5 min. The proteins in the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 and visualized under UV with Quantum ST5 (Vilber).",

The sensor chip contained four flow cells. Two different surface capacities were prepared on each flow cell with 300 RU of RNA and 410 RU of RNA respectively, while the other two flow cells served as reference. For detecting the interactions between RNAs and nsp9, running buffer was used as the basal buffer with a constant flow rate of 30 lL/min. The association time with the RNA sensor was set to 60 s, and the dissociation time to 180 s. Nsp9 proteins were injected from low to high concentrations to observe interactions with the oligonucleotide. To examine the role of individual residues in RNA binding, a series of nsp9 mutants were injected at the same concentration of 25 lM in the sensor chip. Between trials, the sensor chips were regenerated with 0.2% SDS to remove any trace of nsp9 proteins.",
