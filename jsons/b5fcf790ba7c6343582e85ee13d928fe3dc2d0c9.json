It was reported that there were different clinical features between pediatric and adult patients with COVID-19 [1] . Our previous study had shown that conjunctivitis symptoms were found in a minority of adult patients confirmed COVID-19, with positive results of viral nucleic acid in conjunctival swab samples [2] . Nevertheless, there are no reports in the medical literature at this time, to our knowledge, on children infected by SARS-CoV-2 with ocular abnormalities. Here we firstly report an infected boy characterized by conjunctivitis and eyelid dermatitis without any other symptom.",

He likely acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from his household member because of his father and grandma diagnosed before. He was quarantined at a government designated hotel with his mother, for being asymptomatic initially. On day 7 of confinement, the child presented with conjunctivitis and eyelid dermatitis (Fig. 1) , and was referred to our hospital subsequently. Admission tests reconfirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, meanwhile revealed myocardial damage and atypical change in lymphocyte count (Table 1) , with normal chest CT. After treatment depending on the national protocol in China [3] , conjunctivitis and eyelid dermatitis gradually disappeared 5 days later. From days 10 to 12 of admission, negative results of viral nucleic acid twice in 48 h, with positive IgG but negative IgM of the virus in serum, indicated that the virus had been cleared [4] . The child left hospital on March 7, 2020, with no respiratory and other systemic symptoms until now.",

ACE2 is expressed not only in human type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in cornea and conjunctiva [7] , suggesting that ocular surface tissue may also be a potential target tissue infected by SARS-CoV-2. Our previous report had shown that conjunctivitis symptoms were found in a small number of adult patients confirmed COVID-19 [2] . However, so far, there has been no report on infected children with eye symptoms. This case showed a child involved conjunctivitis and eyelid dermatitis on day 7 of COVID-19 confirmed. It may be caused by virus infection, or by secondary bacterial infection with poor body resistance after systemic virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that doctors should not forget to conduct COVID-19 screening when children come to hospital for ocular abnormalities during this epidemic period. Except for the specific detection of viral nucleic acid, the results of other laboratory tests of SARS-COV-2 infection in children had no obvious specificity.",
