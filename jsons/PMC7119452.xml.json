Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, 27 of 50 cases were evaluated by this assay (pH1N1 group), and were divided into two groups: pH1N1 nonbacterial co-infection group (n = 20) and pH1N1 with bacterial co-infection group (n = 7). Furthermore, the 12 normal lung tissues previously mentioned were used in the assay (normal group). Frozen lung tissues were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Bio-Rad) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Mintabs; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), using a tissue weight (mg) to lysis buffer volume (\u03bcL) ratio of 1:4.

Viral nucleoprotein was localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm of pneumocytes, lining alveoli, or glandular epithelial cells (Figure 5, D and E). To establish a correlation with viral infection or pathological change, the distribution of immune mediators in lung was demonstrated by IHC staining with antibodies against IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10. These antibodies were confirmed to work on FFPE tissues stained with the IHC assay by testing relevant cell controls (Supplemental Figure S1). The specificity of these antibodies was demonstrated by a blocking assay on positive cases using corresponding recombinant protein (Figure 5, I, L, and O) and normal lung tissues as a negative control (Figure 5F). The immune mediator-producing cells were detected in lung and submucosal tissues with varying degrees of distribution. Immunostaining for individual cytokines and viral antigen was performed using consecutive sections. IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and viral antigen were localized in similar areas within pneumocytes and submucosal glands of patients with bacterial co-infection (Figure 5, G\u2013N).

The resulting involvement of respiratory tract epithelial cells is one of the major reasons for several manifestations that accompany infection, such as cough, depressed tracheobronchial clearance, and altered pulmonary function.31 Infection also elicits a cascade of host immune defenses leading to local inflammation and an influx of polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages into the respiratory tract mucosa and lung.32 Although this response leads to resolution of the infection and protection against reinfection, it is likely that it also contributes to the development of local and systemic symptoms. In addition, it has traditionally been well documented that danger to the host is generated when infection by an influenza virus predisposes to secondary infections with bacterial pathogens.33 This study was designed to evaluate the role of viral load and distribution, cytokine response, and apoptosis in the pathogenesis of 2009 pH1N1 virus infection.",

In the present study, our results show that viral load in lung tissues can be detected as late as day 17 after the onset of illness and peaks on day 7 after onset. This finding could be related to viral infection of the lung parenchyma, because patients with pneumonia had higher viral loads than those with bronchitis or upper respiratory tract infection.36 This could also be explained by a less effective innate and adaptive immune response, combined with a delay in starting antiviral therapy due to a late presentation of symptoms, because antiviral therapy can shorten the duration of viral shedding if prescribed during the first 3 days of illness.37\n",

Interestingly, IL-8 mRNA levels were not positively correlated with viral load, although IL-8 is present in significant levels in lung tissues from 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases. The result could be explained by the nature of IL-8 and its function in influenza. IL-8 is a potent promoter of polymorphonuclear cell movement from blood into tissues, where these cells release mediators that can be harmful and may persist for relatively long periods after stimulation.38 However, IL-8 is not a potential mediator of the measured symptoms and signs of influenza A infection.39 In addition, unlike previous seasonal influenza studies,40 RANTES levels in 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases were not significantly different from the normal lung group. However, viral load was positively correlated with RANTES mRNA level in lung tissues. Thus, it can be reasonably assumed that the virus may effectively induce RANTES expression in lung because mRNA can be detected more extensively than the corresponding cytokine, playing a physiological role during the viral infection. RANTES, a chemokine, plays an active role in recruiting leukocytes into inflammatory sites and induces the proliferation and activation of certain natural killer cells to form chemokine-activated killer cells.41 Previous studies have shown that RANTES is associated with an increase in the efficiency of virus-cell fusion.42\n",

            "text": "Viral pathogenesis in severe infections may be associated with both the viral replication and potentially an exacerbated host immune response. A previously published study suggested that parenchymal lung involvement of the 2009 pH1N1 virus is similar to the histopathological features and viral localization seen in fatal human case-patients of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1).22 Studies have suggested that a cytokine storm occurs in highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) cases,17, 18 and the high virulence of H5N1 virus is associated with increased host responses.46 However, the 2009 pH1N1 virus was thought to be a less virulent virus than H5N1, because it induces mild illness in 8% to 32% of infected persons.47 In this study, our evidence suggests that a virus-induced immune response is present in the lungs of fatal cases, as demonstrated by increased levels of cytokines/chemokines, including IL-1RA, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and IP-10. IL-1RA is generally thought to be a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. However, the balance of IL-1RA and IL-1 levels in local tissues influences the physiological or pathophysiological effects.48 Some studies have suggested that IL-1RA has varying inflammatory effects, and IL-1RA levels are positively associated with the severity of certain infectious diseases.49, 50, 51 In addition to IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 previously mentioned, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and IP-10 can play important roles in the innate immune response that is crucial for the initiation and subsequent direction of adaptive immune responses, as well as in promoting localized inflammation and producing cytokines that recruit additional leukocytes to the site of infection. However, unrestrained or excessive stimulation of the innate immune response can be harmful. Furthermore, the levels of immune mediators in the lung are positively correlated with viral load. Our evidence suggests that the virus can replicate efficiently and achieve a high viral load in the lung at an early stage of infection. Immunostaining for individual cytokines and viral antigens, performed on consecutive sections, showed that IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and viral antigen were localized in similar areas within lung and submucosal glands. Monokines (IL-6 and IL-8) were detected in both small cells within alveolar walls and larger cells in the alveolar air spaces, whereas lymphokine IP-10 was seen mainly in small cells located within the alveolar walls. The presentation of these cytokines/chemokines is consistent with the documented results that CD8+ and CD68+ immune cells are extensively present in lung tissues,22, 52 and may activate the complement system in lung tissues of 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases,52 resulting in an exacerbated host immune response. Taken together, we conclude that the virus can replicate efficiently in lung, and viral pathogenesis is related to both viral replication and production of proinflammatory mediators.",

Influenza-induced apoptosis has been found in a variety of cell types both in vitro and in vivo.53, 54, 55 However, the precise mechanism of virus-induced apoptosis is unclear. Currently, there are two major pathways of apoptosis induction. The intrinsic pathway is regulated by the activation or interaction of members of the Bcl-2 family. This was postulated to be a host defense mechanism, by stopping the replication and spread of virus. The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is triggered by certain TNF family members when they engage their respective cognate receptors on the surface of the target cells. In addition to TNF itself and TRAIL, Fas/FasL belongs to a subfamily of ligands that are responsible for extrinsic induction of cell death. Our results suggested that apoptosis is present in lung tissues of 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases, and mRNA levels of the FasL gene, which are positively correlated with viral load, are remarkably elevated in lung tissues; however, TRAIL mRNA levels were not significantly increased. In addition, the expression of the FAS gene was inhibited in lung tissues. Animal model studies have suggested that FasL is involved in viral clearance and in the development of immunopathological characteristics after respiratory tract virus infection,56, 57, 58, 59 and mice with a deficiency in functional FasL exhibit reduced morbidity after influenza virus infection compared with wild-type mice.58 However, our results suggest that in fatal human pH1N1 cases, elevated FasL levels trigger the induction of apoptosis in lung tissues, resulting in severe pathological characteristics, and the disequilibrium between Fas and FasL could delay viral clearance. In addition, the common event in most pathways of influenza virus-induced apoptosis is the activation of a set of cysteine proteases (caspases).60 In this study, colocalization of cleaved caspase-3 with apoptotic bodies can be seen in both lung and airway of 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases, although the expression of other subtypes of caspases was not studied. The results indicate that caspase-3 is involved in the pathway of 2009 pH1N1-induced apoptosis in fatal cases.",
