Radiologic technologists are thus at risk of occupational exposure to the SARS-COV-2 virus, due to cross-infection. This endangers the personal safety of radiologic technologist. Therefore, it is of particular importance to describe how to avoid the cross-infection in the radiology department. This review summarizes the systematic strategies to protect radiologic technologists against COVID-19 from the radiology department in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, P.R. China. This includes personnel arrangements, environmental modification, protection levels and configurations, radiological imaging, and disinfection methods. It can provide guidance to other radiology departments faced with COVID-19 to reduce infection risk for radiologic technologists.",

The infection managers are mainly responsible for training all the personnel in the department. Before working, all the personnel were trained with regards to infection knowledge, including on-site training and guidance, using demonstration pictures, recorded videos, etc. The aim was to ensure that the entire radiology team had accurate knowledge of infection, ultimately ensuring that the personnel had the least risk of infection.",

The technologists should first register and print out the information of the patients, take the lists to the clean area in isolation ward, and put on the protective equipment according to the ward management requirements. It is necessary for the radiologic technologists to wear BSL-3 protective equipment before entering the ward. Subsequently, the mobile DR is pushed to a fixed position to connect to the network. After the patient information is stored in mobile DR, the technologist makes an X-ray of the patient\u2019s chest. It is worth noting that the flat detector of the mobile DR is wrapped with disposable sheets to avoid cross-infection. During shooting, the technologists may minimize close contact with patients. After taking the X-ray, the disposable sheets are placed in a special trash bin place and the flat detector is disinfected with 75 % ethanol solution after every X-ray. The technologists don\u2019t change (part of their) protective gear when moving from one patient to the next. But they must perform hand hygiene. After the images are sent to PACS, technologists can leave isolation ward.",

For air disinfection, all the central air conditioners are turned off to avoid mutual pollution of the air. Additionally, there is an air purifier prepared in the CT control room, which is turned on all the time. The contaminated area, potentially contaminated area, buffer rooms and clean area are all equipped with UV lamps; the air is disinfected by the UV lamps for about 60 min at least 2\u20133 times daily. For surface wiping disinfection, we use 1000 mg/L chlorine disinfectant to wipe and disinfect the surface. For the wipe of non-corrosive surfaces (such as the CT scanner including gantry and scanner table), we use 75 % ethanol to wipe and disinfect the surface. The frequency is at least twice a day. After the disinfection with the chlorine-containing disinfectant is completed, we use soft cloth dipped with clean water to clean the residual chlorine disinfectant on the surface of the device, and then dry it naturally. After disinfection with ethanol, it can be dried naturally. For floor disinfection, the ground is preferably wiped with 1000 mg/L of chlorine-containing disinfectant, at least twice a day, and disinfected at any time in case of pollutants.",
