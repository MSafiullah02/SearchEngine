            "text": "Sea perch, Lateolabrax japonicus, an economically important species, is widely cultured in Asia, especially in China. It has been increasingly threatened by various diseases caused by bacteria and viruses due to its extensive farming (Jia, Jia, & Yi, 2015; Zhao, Fu, Wang, Jiao, & Qiu, 2016). Of which, viral nervous necrosis (VNN), caused by nervous necrosis virus (NNV), has been widely reported in more than 40 cultured fish, including sea perch and grouper, and resulted in significant economic losses (Nakai et al., 2009). However, there is still no effective method to prevent or control VNN. In teleost fish, the innate immune system plays a critical role in host against virus infection, but studies on the immune system of sea perch are still limited. In recent years, researches on immunity of sea perch against NNV infection were mainly focused on single genes, and only a few immune\u2010related genes, including LGP2 (Jia, Zhang et al., 2015), MDA5 (Jia, Jia et al., 2016), MAVS (Jia, Jin et al., 2016), TRAF3 (Zhang et al., 2018), HSP27 (Le, Jia et al., 2017) and RAVER1 (Jia et al., 2017), have been identified and characterized in sea perch. However, knowledge about the immunity system of sea perch, especially the immune response\u2010related signalling pathways implicated in NNV infection, still remains incomplete. Systematic study of sea perch immune\u2010related signalling pathway is necessary to provide the fundamental understanding of the interaction between sea perch and NNV.",

Therefore, cells originated from sea perch brain should be a good material for studying sea perch\u2013NNV interaction. In our previous study, a continuous cell line L. japonicus brain (LJB), derived from the brain of sea perch, was established and exhibited susceptibility to red\u2010spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) (Le, Li et al., 2017). In this study, transcriptome sequencing libraries were constructed with RGNNV\u2010infected or mock\u2010infected LJB cells. Based on the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we found that p53 signalling pathway might be involved in the immune response against RGNNV, and experimentally revealed the role of L. japonicus p53 (Ljp53) in the regulation of the type I IFN response and cellular apoptosis during RGNNV infection. This study provides insight into the immune response of sea perch against RGNNV infection and the important role of Ljp53 in inhibiting RGNNV infection.",

Fortunately, the partial sequence of Ljp53 obtained from high\u2010throughput sequencing data contained the complete coding sequence of Ljp53 (GenBank accession number MH940221). To elucidate the role of Ljp53 during RGNNV infection in vitro, the transcription level of RDRP was detected in Ljp53 overexpressing LJB cells. As shown in Figure 5a,b, a significantly attenuated expression of RDRP was observed in Ljp53 expressing LJB cells, whereas pifithrin\u2010\u03b1 caused down\u2010regulation of Ljp53 led to opposite results, suggesting the antiviral role of Ljp53 during RGNNV infection. Many works have demonstrated that p53 contributed to the innate antiviral response by enhancing type I IFN\u2010dependent antiviral activity (Ding et al., 2018; Mu\u00f1oz\u2010Fontela et al., 2008). To further reveal the potential antiviral mechanism of Ljp53, the luciferase reporter assay was performed.

            "text": "Gene comparative screening identified a lot of DEGs, including several known immune\u2010related genes, such as IRF3, STAT1 and ISG15. Previous reports indicated that ISG15 could be induced by RGNNV infection in European sea bass and Senegalese sole (\u00c1lvarez\u2010Torres et al., 2017; Moreno, Garcia\u2010Rosado, Borrego, & Alonso, 2016). However, in this study, the expression of ISG15 was reduced at 48 hpi. ISG15, as an antiviral effector, was demonstrated to play important roles in defence against RGNNV infection in teleost (Liu et al., 2018; Moreno, Alvarez\u2010Torres, Garcia\u2010Rosado, Borrego, & Alonso, 2018). Many viruses have developed different mechanisms to escape the antiviral response, including counteracting the activity of ISG15 (Guerra, C\u00e1ceres, Knobeloch, Horak, & Esteban, 2008; Yuan & Krug, 2001). Several studies have addressed NNV persistent infections in many fish, indicating NNV has developed some mechanisms to antagonize host innate antiviral responses (Lu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). We speculated that RGNNV might counteract the antiviral activity of ISG15 to escape the host antiviral response in LJB cells. Zinc finger protein 395 (ZNF395) is one of the most down\u2010regulated genes (decreased by 18.11 times) in this study. ZNF395, as a novel hypoxia\u2010inducible transcription factor, contributes to the maximal stimulation of a subset of ISGs, such as ISG15, IFIT1/ISG56, IFI44, CXCL10 and CXCL11 (Schroeder, Herwartz, Jordanovski, & Steger, 2017). In this study, in line with the down\u2010regulation of ISG15, the expression of ZNF395 was also decreased. Given these results, it is possible that the declining level of ZNF395 may impair host antiviral responses by reducing the expression of ISGs involved in the innate immune response during RGNNV infection. It was known that ZNF395\u2010mediated activation of ISGs was depended on IKK signalling (Jordanovski et al., 2013). In present work, the expression levels of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, the catalytic subunits of IKK, were also repressed post\u2010RGNNV infection. Further experiments would be necessary to determine the association of ISG15, ZNF395 and IKK signalling in sea perch. In addition, among these DEGs, HSPB1, also named HSP27, was down\u2010regulated, similar to our previous study (Le, Jia et al., 2017). HSPB1 has been reported to be widely involved in pathophysiology of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Overexpression of HSPB1 protected cells from oxidative damage and apoptosis triggered by Cd exposure (Mun\u0304oz\u2010Fontela, 2005). In our previous study, overexpression of LjHSP27 inhibited RGNNV\u2010induced apoptosis, supporting the vital role of HSP27 as an anti\u2010apoptosis protein (Le, Jia et al., 2017). It has been known that many DNA and RNA viruses can trigger oxidative stress and induce host cell death in infected cells (Casavant et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2015). The role of LjHSP27 against oxidative stress still needs further research.",

Recently, numbers of studies have shown that p53 signalling pathway is involved in the process of different virus infection and replication. For example, porcine circovirus type 2 infection induced S phase accumulation to promote viral replication in host cells via activation of the p53 signalling pathway (Xu et al., 2016). Classical swine fever virus Shimen regulated p53 signalling pathway to subvert host innate immune response (Ning et al., 2017). Given the important role of p53 signalling pathway during virus infection, in this study, we focused our analysis on the DEGs associated with p53 signalling pathway. qRT\u2010PCR results indicated that p53 signalling pathway was involved in RGNNV infection and inhibited by RGNNV. In p53 signalling pathway, Mdm2 and Mdm4 are major negative regulators of p53 (Chai et al., 2018; Raja, Ronsard, Lata, Trivedi, & Banerjea, 2017). A significant negative correlation was also found between Mdm2 and Ljp53 in this study. Thus, we speculated that RGNNV might repress the expression of Ljp53 by activating Mdm2 during RGNNV infection. As Mdm2 has been initially identified as a required host factor for viral replication (Raja et al., 2017), we cannot exclude an ambivalent role of Mdm2 during infection, as a result of its multiple functions and interactions with other host factors. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between Mdm4 and Ljp53. Previous study reported that Mdm2 targeted Mdm4 for proteasomal degradation in response to DNA damage (Kawai et al., 2003). Thus, we speculated that sea perch Mdm2 might also bind to Mdm4 for degradation during RGNNV infection. Nevertheless, to clarify the relationship of sea perch Mdm2 and Mdm4, more experiments will be required.",

Here, the expression of RDRP was significant reduced in Ljp53 overexpressing cells post\u2010RGNNV infection, whereas pifithrin\u2010\u03b1 caused opposite results.

Several studies have reported that p53 can induce apoptosis through activating death receptor pathway or mitochondrial pathway (Benchimol, 2001; Moll & Zaika, 2001). Our previous study demonstrated that RGNNV infection caused apoptosis at 6 and 24 hpi in LJB cells (Le, Jia et al., 2017). Meanwhile, our results indicated that three apoptosis\u2010related genes, including Casp3, Casp9 and CytC, were notably enhanced as the ectopic expression of Ljp53 in vitro, whereas pifithrin\u2010\u03b1 caused the opposite effect. In addition, significantly higher level of caspase 3 activities was observed in Ljp53 overexpressing cells post\u2010RGNNV infection. All these results indicated the pro\u2010apoptotic function of Ljp53 (Supporting Information Figure S2). It has been known that p53\u2010dependent apoptosis could be used by host as a useful mechanism to repress virus infection (Mun\u0304oz\u2010Fontela et al., 2005; Turpin et al., 2005). On the other hand, many viruses have also developed strategies to manipulate host p53 signalling pathways to increase virus replication (Casavant et al., 2006; Royds et al., 2006). For example, coronavirus inhibited p53\u2010mediated host apoptosis to ensure viral growth in infected cells (Yuan et al., 2015). In our study, RGNNV infection reduced the expression of Ljp53 at 48 hpi, which at least partially inhibited the host cell apoptosis. We speculated that RGNNV might repress the p53\u2010dependent apoptosis to promote virus replication in RGNNV\u2010infected LJB cells and facilitate transmission of newly formed viral particles to other cells.",
