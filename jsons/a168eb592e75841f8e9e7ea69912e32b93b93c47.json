            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in thousands of critically ill patients and poses a serious threat globally. To investigate if SARS-CoV-2 can affect early human embryos, we analysed scRNAseq datasets of human embryos for the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and BSG (CD147), the serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral spike protein priming, and the endosomal protease CTSL for spike protein activation via the endosomal route. The results reveal that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast cells, and both BSG and CTSL are expressed in all the stages of embryonic development. The cells of the blastocysts express genes encoding for other coronavirus receptors such as DPP4 and ANPEP as well. Interestingly, the cells of the epiblast also express genes involved in viral endocytosis and replication. We further identified 194 genes that are differentially expressed in ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells as compared to ACE2-and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the epiblast. Our results show that developing human embryos express the receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses; embryos also harbour the necessary machinery for viral internalization and replication. We suggest that couples be advised to avoid conceiving during the pandemic and that IVF procedures be kept to a minimum to prevent any possible hazard to the developing embryos.",

Like most viruses, the coronaviruses enter the host cell by receptor binding followed by endocytosis, genome replication, exocytosis, and budding (Fehr et al. 2015) . Recent studies have shown that the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) is the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Letko, Marzi and Munster, 2020) . Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 does not use other coronavirus receptors viz; alanine aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which are used by CoV-229E and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively, for entry into host cells (Li, 2015; Letko, Marzi and Munster, 2020) .",

Another endosomal protease, cathepsin L (CTSL), is also involved in processing of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein via the endosomal route (Ou et al., 2020) . In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 utilizes Basigin (BSG), also known as CD147, as a receptor for viral entry (Wang et al., 2020) .

However, the main focus of the studies on SARS-CoV-2 and host interactions is on adult tissues, little is known about the effects of the virus on embryos. Studies on preimplantation mammalian embryos are important because maternal viral infections during early pregnancy can induce embryonic death or abnormal embryonic development (Hardy, 1974; Silasi et al., 2015; Racicot and Mor, 2017) . With the high population estimates of SARS-CoV-2 spread (Li et al., 2020) and the observation that a large proportion of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, (Ling et al. 2020 , Pan et al. 2020 , Wu et al. 2020 it is likely that many women may have conceived during the course of subclinical infection. Secondly, many assisted reproduction clinics may have handled human gametes and embryos from subclinically infected couples or inadvertently exposed them to infected laboratory personnel. Given the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has a long shelf life on various surfaces (Ong et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020) , there are many potential routes by which gametes/embryos could be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. However, whether the gametes or early human embryos can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses remains unknown.",

As evident from Figure. 1., high amounts of ACE2 mRNA was detected in the zygotic stage of development followed by a decrease until morula stage with a subsequent sudden increment in the inner cell mass (ICM), epiblast, and the primitive endoderm. BSG mRNA was consistently detected in all stages of embryonic development with an increase in levels from zygotic stage to blastocyst stage. TMPRSS2 was not detected in the zygotes, but a low abundance of transcripts was detected at early stages of embryonic development that further increased during later stages. The highest mRNA levels of TMPRSS2 were observed in epiblast cells. DPP4 and ANPEP mRNA was not detected in the zygote or 4-cell embryos; however, abundant DPP4 and ANPEP transcripts were abundantly detected at all stages of embryonic development ( Figure. 1.).

Further, with nearly 1 in 6 couples worldwide facing infertility, many couples resort to in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques for achieving biological parenthood. In both these scenarios, it is imperative to understand whether the developing embryo is at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this question, we analysed single-cell RNA-Seq datasets of developing human embryos for SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and BSG along with the spike protein processing enzymes TMPRSS2 and CTSL in zygotes to hatched blastocysts. Our results reveal that gametes, zygotes, and 4-cell embryos express abundant amounts of ACE2 and BSG along with CTSL but not TMPRSS2. While the levels of ACE2 decline in the compact morula, the expression of ACE2 and the processing enzymes increases in the ICM and epiblast. While ACE2 is essential, the processing of the spike protein by the membranebound serine protease TMPRSS2 promotes viral infectivity. We observed that although more than 80% of cells of the ICM express ACE2, none of these cells express TMPRSS2, indicating that the early ICM may not be highly susceptible to viral infection. However, in the epiblast (but not the primitive endoderm) a significant proportion of cells co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 suggesting that these cells would be targets for viral entry. Beyond ACE2, a study has shown that the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase enhancer CD147 encoded by the gene BSG binds to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and promotes viral entry independent of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Chen et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2020) . We observed that BSG transcripts were abundantly expressed in all the cells of the developing embryos from zygote stage to blastocyst stage. With regard to S protein priming, cathepsins are a class of endosomal proteases, and of these, cathepsin L encoded by CTSL is required for endosomal cleavage of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Ou et al., 2020) . Interestingly, along with BSG, CTSL was co-expressed in most of the cells of the developing embryo. Presently it is unclear if CD147mediated viral entry requires cathepsin L; the fact that both these proteins are co-expressed in most embryonic cells implies that developing embryos may be susceptible to coronavirus infections by the ACE2-independent mode of action.",

In this course, most enveloped viruses recruit the ESCRT machinery in which the viral structural protein engages the tumour susceptibility gene protein (TSG101) in ESCRT-I, which ultimately delivers ESCRT-III to sites of viral budding where membrane scission releases the viral particles (Votteler and Sundquist, 2013) . Several proteins are involved in the ESCRT pathway, and the blocking of any of these enzymes can prevent viral endocytosis including that of the coronavirus family (Wang et al., 2017; Mazzon and Marsh, 2019) . For SARS-CoV-2 to be pathogenic to human embryos, the early embryonic cell must possess the components of the ESCRT machinery for viral endocytosis and release. Interestingly, we observed that genes for many members of the ESCRT machinery are not expressed in zygote and morula stages, but a surge in the expression of these select genes occurs in the cells of the blastocyst including the ICM, epiblast, and primitive endoderm. These results indicate that the human blastocysts expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptors not only have the necessary machinery for the virus to bind, but also facilitate endocytosis and viral budding.",

These genes were also uniformly expressed in cells of the early ICM and the primitive endoderm (not shown).

Any damage to these cells, physically or functionally, may lead to embryo lethality or dysfunctions in the organs of the foetus/adults. To understand the potential damage that may occur to the embryos by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analysed the gene signature of ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells of the epiblast. We identified mRNA for 194 genes that were differentially expressed between the ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells and ACE2-and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the epiblast. Unique gene signatures of ACE2-positive cells have also been reported for other tissues (Seow et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . Interestingly, as compared to ACE2-and TMPRSS2-negative cells, 189/194 genes were overexpressed in the ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells, and only 5/194 genes were present in lower abundance in the ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells. Amongst the overabundant genes were cathepsins (including CTSL), prostaglandin synthetase, and glutamyl aminopeptidase, which have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or enriched with ACE2 in different tissues (Ou et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020) . In the adult human liver, the highest expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is detected in TROP2-positive cells (Seow et al., 2020) . In the present study, high expression of TROP2 (also known as TACSTD2) was also detected in the cells of the epiblast. These results imply that the ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells may have unique functions in developing embryos. Interestingly, functional annotation revealed that the 194 differentially abundant genes play important roles in many aspects of development such as cell migration and metabolism. Furthermore, the gene signature also included genes facilitating viral entry into host cells and vacuole acidification. In this context it is imperative to note that pH reduction inside endosomes is essential for CTSL activation, which in turn is required to cleave the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Ou et al., 2020) . Thus, our analyses reveal that the ACE2-and TMPRSS2-positive cells in the epiblast have key roles in embryonic development and may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Damage to these cells may cause embryo lethality at early stages of development or damage the process of tissue specification.",

Currently, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. While coronaviruses are unrelated to the influenza and Zika viruses, our data imply potential embryotoxic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Presently, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that individuals with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 should avoid pregnancy. However, there is no clarity on the course of action for women/couples seeking IVF treatment, and several clinics continue to service patients seeking IVF, excluding only those who are symptomatic or who have recent travel history. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) has released its report of the ESHRE COVID-19 working group to monitor scientific reports relevant to reproductive medicine. The committee recommends that assisted reproduction treatments should not be started during the COVID-19 pandemic mainly for social reasons, as the report indicates that there is no specific data available; instead, it states an assumption that sperm, oocytes, and embryos do not have receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and are unlikely to be infected. Contradicting this assumption, we herein show that the receptors for coronaviruses are expressed in developing embryos. While we believe that the zona pellucida will act as a barrier to viral entry in the zygotes until the morula stages, receptors for coronaviruses are abundantly expressed in the cells of hatched blastocysts that can potentially get exposed to contaminated media and surfaces. We believe that our data will aid clinicians and societies in decision making regarding the management of patients seeking IVF or reporting miscarriages during the pandemic.",
