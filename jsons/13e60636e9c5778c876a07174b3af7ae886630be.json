The probability of detection was as low as 1% at the start of local epidemics, increasing as the number of reported cases increased exponentially. The precision of estimates increased with the number of full-length viral genomes in a location. The viral phylogeny was informative of the variance in the reproductive number with the 32% most infectious individuals contributing 80% of total transmission events. This is the first study that incorporates both the viral genomes and time series case data in the estimation of undetected COVID-19 infections. Our findings suggest the presence of undetected infections broadly and that superspreading events are contributing less to observed dynamics than during the SARS epidemic in 2003.

However, the estimate of infection numbers is sensitive to the variance in the offspring distribution (defined as the distribution of secondary infections caused by each infected individual, the mean of which is the reproductive number). That is to say, large outbreaks can occur even if the reproductive number is close to one because of superspreading events 5 . Quantifying the variance around the reproductive number improves the accuracy of estimates of the number of infections and the reproductive number and offers an estimate of the contribution of superspreading events to observed outbreak dynamics. Viral genomic sequencing is becoming more widespread during viral epidemics 6 and pathogen genomes can inform estimates of the number of infections as well as the variance around the reproductive number 7 . Integrating the analyses of genomic data into epidemiological mathematical modeling frameworks can jointly estimate reproductive numbers, variance in the reproductive number, and the total number of infections in a population, which are correlated with each other and difficult to estimate using time series case data alone 8 .",

The dependence on the final outbreak size distribution to estimate could explain the difference in estimates, as there are different delays in returning testing results in different countries and final outbreak sizes are still not available for most regions as the pandemic is ongoing.

This could explain the seemingly high detection rates in California, New York, and the United Kingdom, where multiple smaller outbreaks are occurring within the country or state, but genomic data were only generated from a subset of those locations, biasing results towards underestimation of the total number of cases at the state or country level. Conversely, the estimated infection numbers are likely biased upwards near the root of the phylogeny due to multiple introductions into each location 22 .
