CAs are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual\u2019s life expectancy, health status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. DD/ID are common features of a wide variety of genetic syndromes, or they could be isolated findings. Due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity associated with CA/DD/ID, establishing a syndromic diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms can be challenging, particularly in the newborn period. Furthermore, some CAs may not be easily diagnosed in the newborn period but could contribute to a lifelong burden to affected children and families. Clinical genetic testing can assist clinicians in confirming or establishing a clinical diagnosis that may lead to changes in clinical management, obviate the need for further testing, or end the diagnostic odyssey, which may improve outcomes for the patient and family.",

Studies that failed to meet inclusion criteria were excluded in title/abstract review or in full-text review. Discordance between reviewers at each step was resolved through discussion, with adjudication by the methodologist or other group members, if needed. We identified additional publications through review of the references cited by included studies. We specifically sought to identify gray literature; that is, relevant data captured in laboratory and/or hospital registries of patients with CA/DD/ID, presented at conferences, and/or published as conference abstracts.

            "text": "Mortality and morbidity were reported in three studies. In a case series of patients with CA, a patient in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with suspected biliary atresia was scheduled for interoperative cholangiogram with reflex to Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy.20 A provisional diagnosis of Alagille syndrome obtained with GS (later confirmed by CMA) was conveyed to doctors urgently, as the patient was in the operating room for induction of general anesthesia for the planned procedure. In patients with Alagille syndrome, the Kasai procedure is associated with increased risk for liver transplant and higher mortality.21 The consensus of an international expert panel was that cancellation of the surgery led to the reduction in mortality risk by 83\u201394%, compared with the clinical course of a (nonstudy) patient who presented similarly and underwent the surgery the following month. In the same case series, morbidity was avoided in 61% (11/18) of patients who received a diagnosis with rapid GS (results returned in less than 2 weeks), compared with none of the patients who received standard of care,20 suggesting that obtaining a timely diagnosis may result in appropriate management and improved clinical outcomes. In a series of acutely ill infants in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICU and PICU), Willig et al. reported a higher 120-day mortality rate in 57% (12/21) of patients who received a genetic diagnosis with rapid GS compared with 14% (2/14) of patients who did not, suggesting this population is more medically fragile and may benefit from obtaining results quickly to guide care. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.46).22 A case series of patients undergoing rapid ES in Australia reported a mortality rate of 23% (9/40).23 Generally, however, reported health outcomes were often subjective in nature.",

In a prospective case series of 80 infants with multiple CA and dysmorphic features from Australia, ES resulted in a decision to change surveillance for three patients.7 In one case, echocardiography surveillance for suspected infantile Marfan syndrome was discontinued since the diagnosis was excluded due to the finding of a pathogenic variant in CHRDL1 causing X-linked megalocornea (OMIM 309300). The need for diagnostic tissue biopsy was eliminated for two patients diagnosed with mitochondrial disorders through ES, including combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 11 (OMIM 614922) and mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 deficiency (OMIM 616277)43 and for an additional three patients with CA/DD/ID in the Illumina iHope program10 and for three patients with CA who received rapid ES results in a case series from Australia.23 In a case series of patients with CA/DD/ID, additional invasive testing/procedures were halted in 2% (2/115) of patients after ES. One patient stopped invasive testing for pulmonary causes of respiratory insufficiency after ES identified a pathogenic variant in KIAA1279 causing Goldberg\u2013Shprintzen megacolon syndrome (OMIM 609460), and another patient stopped testing for a mitochondrial disorder after ES identified a pathogenic variant in SNAP25.26 In another case series of patients with CA, rapid GS yielded a diagnosis of ABCC8-associated familial hyperinsulinism type 1 (OMIM 256450) in a patient with hyperinsulinemia.22 The authors reported that the GS results and clinical presentation suggested the focal form of the disorder. Additional imaging was performed that confirmed focal pancreatic lesions and the patient underwent targeted resection, which avoided development of insulin-dependent diabetes, and resulted in a shorter length of stay in the hospital. The patient remained euglycemic more than one year later.22 Overall, many studies reported a change in planned procedures or surveillance strategies, mainly due to a change in the patient\u2019s diagnosis; however, rarely did the authors present data or a description of any resultant reduction in mortality or morbidity.",

The authors reported optic nerve abnormalities were identified in relatives who were PAX2 variant carriers.34 In a case series of 119 patients with DD/ID and neurodevelopmental disorders, a cardiology referral for evaluation of a congenital heart defect was recommended for a patient\u2019s mother after the patient was diagnosed with Renpenning syndrome (OMIM 309500) caused by a pathogenic variant in PQBP1 gene.27 Cascade testing enabled a diagnosis in 12 relatives of the infants in an Australian cohort with multiple CA who had ES results.7 Although the main impact of ES/GS is for the clinical care of the patient, several studies reported impacts to at-risk family members resulting from a diagnosis in the patient. However, subsequent reductions to mortality or morbidity resulting from the identification of these family members and changes in their clinical care were not reported.",

We identified three studies with n \u2265 20 patients and two studies with n < 20 describing the harms associated with ES and/or GS. Baldridge et al. reported two cases of nonpaternity in their case series of 155 patients that required ethics consultation and altered strategies for pretest counseling.24 Nonpaternity was identified in a single case by van Diemen and colleagues. In that patient, it was necessary to disclose nonpaternity to the family to confirm the diagnosis.46 In a case report by He and colleagues, subsequent to ES, parents declined a potentially therapeutic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for economic reasons.50",

We identified one RCT and numerous case series and case reports describing clinical and patient outcomes, for which the overall evidence was limited. However, a change in patient management was observed in nearly all included studies (including case reports), and a substantial number of publications reported a clinical impact on the patient\u2019s family members or an impact on reproductive outcomes. Future studies of ES/GS results for patients with CA/DD/ID should explicitly measure patient and family outcomes resulting from testing to better assess the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS.",
