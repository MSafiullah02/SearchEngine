The \"Procalcitonin Guidance to Reduce Antibiotic Treatment of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Children and Adolescents\" (ProPAED) study included 337 children diagnosed with LRTI or CAP in 2 Swiss Emergency Departments. Children were randomized (1) to receive therapy based on a PCT-guided algorithm (similar to the adult algorithm described above) or (2) to follow standard clinical guidelines [11] . Among children with CAP in the PCT-guided algorithm, there was a significant reduction in length of antibiotic therapy (5.7 vs 9.1 days; P = .001), but rates of antibiotic initiation were similar (71% vs 79%) in both groups.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 127, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 128, "end": 131, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "Esposito et al [12] enrolled 319 children with uncomplicated CAP in a randomized trial using a simpler PCT algorithm.

Controls were treated according to the Italian Society of Pediatrics' guidelines, which recommends antibiotic therapy for all hospitalized children with CAP [28] . Clinical cure rates were equivalent in both groups. Significantly fewer patients in the PCT arm started antibiotics (86% vs 100%), and the overall antibiotic duration was shorter (5.4 vs 11 days) (P < .05 for both).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 19, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 442, "end": 446, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "Pediatric guidelines currently emphasize antibiotics for most children hospitalized with CAP, even though most do not have confirmed bacterial pneumonia [1] .

Confidence intervals were derived using the continuity-corrected efficient-score method. potentially limiting antibiotic use in 46% of children. To optimize the treatment of children hospitalized with CAP while reducing unnecessary and potentially harmful antibiotic use, clinicians will likely need to integrate PCT with other predictors of outcome and rapid etiologic diagnosis. Patterns of immune response identified by expression profiling may ultimately replace individual biomarkers to differentiate viral from bacterial and mixed infections [29, 30] . Our study has a number of strengths, including prospective enrollment, radiographic confirmation of pneumonia, and comprehensive diagnostic testing, but it also several limitations. Not all children enrolled in EPIC were included in this study; however, all children with typical bacteria detected from the 2 children's hospitals participating in this study were included. Despite extensive testing, 9% of children with CAP had no etiology determined. Based on the continued difficulty in identifying bacterial causes of CAP, it is possible that some children without a typical bacterial pathogen detected were infected with bacteria, particularly those with high PCT. Over 87% of patients in this study received inpatient antibiotics, including 83% of those with only a viral pathogen detected, which may have hampered bacterial detection. Many children did not have residual serum available for PCT analysis; children with residual serum available were more frequently admitted to the ICU than other EPIC enrolled children. Because the prevalence of bacterial detections and severe disease were higher in our study sample, our estimate of the positive predictive value of PCT for these characteristics may be higher than what would have been observed for the entire EPIC cohort. Because PCT testing was not standard of care, serum collection occurred a median of 1 day (IQR, 0-1) after admission; we observed no correlation between time of serum collection and PCT concentrations overall and when stratified by etiology (data not shown). Finally, some studies suggest serial testing increases accuracy in the correlation between PCT concentration and etiologic diagnosis, but we did not perform serial monitoring.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 675, "end": 679, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 680, "end": 683, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "In this large cohort of 532 prospectively enrolled children with strictly defined, radiographically confirmed CAP who underwent extensive testing for etiology, PCT cutoffs of <0.1 and <0.25 ng/mL accurately identified children at lower risk of typical bacterial CAP.
