The SELDI ProteinChip analysis was performed as described previously (8)(10)(13). For each set of binding conditions, samples were analyzed in duplicate. Serum samples (2 \u03bcL) were denatured by addition of 4 \u03bcL of U9 buffer (9 mol/L urea, 20 g/L CHAPS, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Denatured serum samples were diluted with 34 \u03bcL of T4 (50 mmol/L sodium acetate, 1 mL/L Triton X-100, pH 4.0) or T9 (10 mmol/L Tris, 1 mL/L Triton X-100, pH 9.0) binding buffer, respectively, to give a final dilution of 20-fold. CM10 ProteinChip arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems) were used in this study. After dilution, 5 \u03bcL of the diluted sample was applied to a preequilibrated ProteinChip array in duplicate in a bioprocessor and incubated with shaking for 90 min at room temperature. After incubation, the ProteinChip arrays were washed 5 times with the same binding buffer and rinsed twice with deionized water. After air-drying, sinapinic acid matrix in 500 mL/L acetonitrile\u20135 mL/L trifluoroacetic acid was added to each array. The ProteinChip arrays were read on the ProteinChip PBS II reader of a ProteinChip Biomarker System (Ciphergen Biosystems) to determine the masses and intensities of all peaks over the range m/z 1000 to 250 000. For each box (12 pieces containing 96 assay spots) of ProteinChip arrays, 1 array (8 assay spots) was used for calibration. Mixtures of peptide/protein calibrators [angiotensin (m/z 1296.51), corticotropin (clip 1\u201317; m/z 2093.46), corticotropin (clip 18\u201339; m/z 2465.72), doubly charged horse apomyoglobin (m/z 8475.8), Escherichia coli thioredoxin (m/z 11 673.5), horse apomyoglobin (m/z 16 951.6), bovine serum albumin (m/z 66 430), and bovine serum albumin dimer (m/z 132 861); Applied Biosystems Ltd.] were added to all 8 assay spots of the calibration array. Intensities of peaks between m/z 1000 and 20 000 were obtained at a laser setting of 183 and a optimized range of m/z 1000 to 20 000; intensities of peaks between m/z 20 000 and 250 000 were obtained at a laser setting of 188 and a optimized range of m/z 20 000 to 150 000. The spectra were smoothed, baseline-subtracted, and externally calibrated. The common peaks among the SELDI mass spectra were identified and quantified by use of Biomarker Wizard software (Ciphergen Biosystems). The peak intensities were normalized with the total ion current and, subsequently, with the total peak intensities. Before data mining, the normalized peak intensities of the duplicate measurements were averaged and log2-transformed. The intraassay CVs of the normalized intensities of various peaks were <15%.",

Briefly, pooled serum samples were first denatured with U9 buffer and diluted with T4 or T9 sample binding buffer, respectively. After incubation for 120 min and subsequent washing, the bound proteins were eluted from the CM10 ceramic beads with 1 mol/L NaCl solution. C18 ZipTips were used to desalt the eluted proteins according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Millipore). The desalted protein preparations were spotted on the gold-coated ProteinChip arrays and examined with the ProteinChip reader to confirm that the purified proteins had the same masses as the targeted SEDLI proteomic features. After confirmation, the purified proteins were resolved by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agents. Proteins on gels were visualized by either colloidal blue (Invitrogentrade;) or silver staining (GE Healthcare). The gel images were then digitized with a densitometer and analyzed by the PDQuest gel analysis software (Ver. 7.3.0; Bio-Rad). Protein spots with masses matched with the differential proteomic features were excised and subjected to mass spectrometric (MS) analysis.",

Trypsin peaks, possible keratin contamination, and matrix cluster peaks were excluded from subsequent collision-induced dissociation. The MS/MS spectra were then processed with Data Explorer software (Ver. 4.4; Applied Biosystems). The spectra were subjected to gaussian smoothing with a filter width of 5 points, and the baselines were corrected with default settings. Peaks were detected based on a signal-to-noise threshold of 15. The fragment masses and intensities of each MS/MS mass spectrum were subjected to an online Mascot MS/MS ion search (http://www.matrixscience.com/) to obtain the protein identities. For the search parameters, the maximum allowed missed cleavage in trypsin digestion was 1; partial oxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine, and iodoacetamide modification of cysteine residues were selected. The error tolerance values of the parent peptides and the MS/MS ion masses were 0.1 and 0.3 Da, respectively. A protein identification result was considered significant when the MS/MS ion profile matched a known protein in the NCBInr (2005/06/01) database with a P value <0.05.

On the one hand, we previously reported that a high neutrophil count was a risk factor associated with clinical deterioration in SARS (26). On the other hand, intravascular fibrin deposition has been observed in SARS patients (29). Vascular fibrin thrombi are often associated with pulmonary infarcts. Specific interactions between neutrophils and fibrin thrombi are well recognized (30). In addition, neutrophils produce a neutral peptide\u2013generating protease that can cleave fibrinogen into peptide fragments (31). It is possible that fibrinogen and/or its fragments are involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism linking neutrophil activation and lung damage.",

Complement 3 (C3), which is composed of an \u03b1 chain (Mr 115 000) and a \u03b2 chain (Mr 75 000), is the central molecule in complement systems comprising the classic, alternative, or lectin pathways. On activation and subsequent inactivation of C3, several physiologic protein fragments, such as C3c, are produced. When examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, C3c separates into a \u03b2-chain (Mr 75 000) and 2 fragments of \u03b1-chain (Mr 27 000 N-terminal fragment and Mr 43 000 C-terminal fragment) (32). The presence of free C3c \u03b1-chain N-terminal fragment in the blood circulation might be the result of degradation of C3c. In the SARS patients, the concentration of this C3c fragment was positively correlated with CRP, suggesting its positive association with the acute-phase reaction and with the activation of the complement system. It is worth nothing that this C3c fragment contains a binding domain for complement receptor type 1 (33). Activation of complement receptor type 1 enhances phagocytosis of the neutrophils (34) and activates B-cell differentiation (35)(36). To date, information about the activation of the complement pathway in SARS patients has been limited. Liao et al. (17) reported that there was no significant difference in C3 concentrations between SARS and control patients. Another group demonstrated that SARS-CoV could trigger complement activation through the lectin pathway (37). The biological relevance of C3 in SARS remains unknown.",

In the present study, the intensity of the proteomic feature at m/z 7769 was significantly lower in SARS patients (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P <0.001); in their study, Yip et al. (7) also reported that it is significantly lower in SARS patients (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P = 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22128). Except for this proteomic feature, the SARS-associated proteomic features in these other studies were different from our findings. These differences might be attributable to different selection criteria for the controls. In the previous studies, the control cases were either healthy persons or persons with viral infections from other clinics. The extent of similarities of symptoms between the SARS and control groups and the time point of blood collection were not considered. In the present study, the control group comprised suspected SARS patients who were admitted to the same hospital as the SARS patients but were later shown to be negative for SARS-CoV infection. The symptoms in the SARS and control groups and the time point of blood collection were very similar. The biomarkers identified in the present study may thus have an advantage in an actual diagnostic setting compared with those identified in the previous studies.",

In their study, Yip et al. (7) used a comprehensive profiling approach. After being denatured with urea and detergent, the serum proteins were first fractionated with anion-exchange beads to give 6 fractions, which were later analyzed with copper ProteinChip arrays and weak cation-exchange CM10 ProteinChip arrays. Use of the comprehensive profiling approach would increase the chance of identification of more potential protein markers (8). In the present study, we analyzed the serum proteins directly after purification with only CM10 ProteinChip arrays at 2 different binding conditions (pH 4 and pH 9). We chose the CM10 ProteinChip arrays (previously called WCX2) because Kang et al. (11) showed that this chip type gives the best profiling result when analyzing serum samples from SARS patients by a direct binding approach (11). Although the direct binding approach might lead to the discovery of fewer biomarkers, such direct binding assays have higher potential to be modified for use as a clinical assay that can be used even when the protein identities of the disease-specific SELDI peaks are not known.",

The current study has demonstrated that within the first week after onset of fever, similar to viral RNA concentration, the serum proteome contains both diagnostic and prognostic information. The SELDI ProteinChip assay could be used for first-line detection of SARS, followed by the quantitative viral RNA assay for confirmation. Once the disease is confirmed, the treatment strategy could be adjusted according to the prognosis based on the SELDI ProteinChip profiling result and the viral RNA concentration.",
