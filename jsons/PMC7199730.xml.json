The initial evidence was suggestive of the outbreak being associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed on January 1 2020. The aetiological agent was characterised as a SARS-like betacoronavirus, later named SARS-CoV-2, and the first whole genome sequence (Wuhan-HU-1) was deposited on NCBI Genbank on January 5 2020 (Wu et al., 2020). Human-to-human transmission was confirmed on January 14 2020, by which time SARS-CoV-2 had already spread to many countries throughout the world. Further extensive global transmission led to the WHO declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 2020.",

The propensity of Betacoronaviridiae to undergo frequent host jumps supports SARS-CoV-2 also being of zoonotic origin. To date, the genetically closest-known lineage is found in horseshoe bats (BatCoV RaTG13) (Zhou et al., 2020). However, this lineage shares 96% identity with SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficiently high to implicate it as the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 (Shaw et al., 2020). The zoonotic source of the virus remains unidentified at the date of writing (April 23 2020).",

Genetic sequence data sheds light on key epidemiological parameters such as doubling time of an outbreak/epidemic, reconstruction of transmission routes and the identification of possible sources and animal reservoirs. Additionally, whole-genome sequence data can inform drug and vaccine design. Indeed, genomic data can be used to identify pathogen genes interacting with the host and allows characterization of the more evolutionary constrained regions of a pathogen genome, which should be preferentially targeted to avoid rapid drug and vaccine escape mutants.",

We focus in particular on mutations that have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies) as these are likely candidates for ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host. After filtering, we characterise homoplasies at 198 sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identify a strong signal of recurrent mutation at nucleotide position 11,083 (Codon 3606 Orf1a), together with two further sites in Orf1ab encoding the non-structural proteins Nsp11 and Nsp13. These, together with a mutation in the Spike protein (21,575, Codon 5), comprise the strongest putative regions under selection in our dataset.",

A full acknowledgements table of those labs which generated and uploaded data is provided in Table S1. Filtering was performed on the downloaded assemblies to exclude those deriving from animals (bat, pangolin), those with more than 1% missing sites, and otherwise spurious assemblies as also listed by nCov-GLUE (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/excludedSeqs). This left a final dataset of 7666 assemblies for downstream analysis. Sequence metadata was obtained from the NextStrain Github repository (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/tree/master/data). While results presented here predominately focus on an analysis of the available assemblies as of April 19 2020, equivalent analyses were performed daily from March 24 2020.

Sites in the first 130 bp and last 50 bp of the alignment were masked, as were positions 18,529, 29,849, 29,851 and 29,853, following the protocol also advocated by NextStrain and to account for the fact many putatively artefactual SNPs are located at the beginning and ends of the alignment. Resulting alignments were manually inspected in UGene (http://ugene.net). Subsequently a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built using the Augur tree implementation selecting RAxML as the tree-building method (Kozlov et al., 2019). The resulting phylogeny was viewed and annotated using ggtree (Yu et al., 2017) (Figs. S1-S2). Throughout, site numbering and genome structure are given using Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) as reference.",

To obtain confidence intervals around each temporal point estimate we conducted a parametric bootstrapping analysis with 25 replicates, keeping the tree topology constant while generating new branch length estimates using a Poisson distribution and running the same model in TreeDater (Volz and Frost, 2017).

However, homoplasies can arise due to convergent evolution (putatively adaptive), recombination, or via errors during the processing of sequence data. The latter is particularly problematic here due to the mix of technologies and methods employed by different contributing research groups. We therefore filtered identified homoplasies using a set of thresholds attempting to circumvent this problem (filtering scripts and figures are available at https://github.com/liampshaw/CoV-homoplasy-filtering).",

Orf1ab is an orthologous gene with other human-associated betacoronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV which both underwent host jumps into humans from likely bat reservoirs (Lau et al., 2005; Memish et al., 2013). We performed an equivalent analysis on human-associated virus assemblies available on the NCBI Virus platform. We identified six putative homoplasic sites within SARS-CoV-1, two occurring within the 3c-like proteinase just upstream of Nsp6 (10,384, 10,793) and a further two homoplasies within Orf1ab at Nsp9 and Nsp13 (Fig. S11).

This corresponded to a further homoplasy identified in Orf1ab Nsp6(position 11,631). It is of note that this genomic region coincides with the strongest homoplasy in SARS-CoV-2 which also occurs in the Nsp6 encoding region of Orf1ab. Codon 3606 of Orf1ab shares a leucine residue in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, though a valine in SARS-CoV.

Of the 198 homoplasies we detect (after applying stringent filters), some proportion are very likely genuine targets of positive selection which signpost to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its new human host. Indeed, we do observe an enrichment for non-synonymous changes (80%) in our filtered sites. As such, our provided list (Table S5) contains candidates for mutations which may affect the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 and virus-host interactions and which require ongoing monitoring. Conversely, the finding that 78% of the homoplasic mutations involve no polarity change could still reflect strong evolutionary constraints at these positions (Hughes, 2007; Yampolsky et al., 2005). The remaining non-neutral changes to amino acid properties at homoplasic sites may be enriched in candidates for functionally relevant adaptation and could warrant further experimental investigation.",

Interestingly, this region overlaps a putative immunogenic peptide predicted to result in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell reactivity (Grifoni et al., 2020). More minor homoplasies amongst our top candidates, identified within Orf3a (Table S5), also map to a predicted CD4 T cell epitope. While the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood at this point, key roles for CD4 T cells, which activate B cells for antibody production, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which kill virus-infected cells, are known to be important in mediating clearance in respiratory viral infections (Kohlmeier and Woodland, 2009). Of note, we also identify a strong recurrent mutation in nucleotide position 21,575, corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (codon 5).

We additionally wish to acknowledge the very large number of scientists in originating and submitting labs who have readily made available SARS-CoV-2 assemblies to the research community.",

Exemplar homoplasy (denoted with *) has been shown on the radial ML phylogenetic tree in panel B. Panel C shows the distribution of cophenetic distances between isolates carrying the identified homoplasy (red) and the distribution for all isolates (grey), showing that isolates with the homoplasy tend to cluster in the phylogeny.
