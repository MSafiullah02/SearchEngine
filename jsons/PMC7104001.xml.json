Studies on the use of TCM have noted lipid regulation activities and anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, and antioxidant effects. To learn more about the therapeutic functions of TCM, experiments are needed to identify the functional ingredients and ascertain the molecular mechanisms of these compounds. Recent research is paying more attention to TCM because it may have future applications in clinical medicine. In particular, rhubarb (Rheum palmatum) is one of the oldest and most famous Chinese herbal medicines and is still used in various herbal remedies and therapeutic applications. Based on current reports and investigation, we believe rhubarb has clinical potential.",

Anthraquinones extracted from the rhubarb rhizome exhibit antidiabetic properties, suggesting a metabolic role in the insulin-stimulated glucose transport pathway [21]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have reported the antimicrobial activities of extracts from Sapindus mukorossi and Rheum emodin against Helicobacter pylori\n[22]. Moreover, the antioxidant and anticancer potential of Rheum emodin rhizome extracts have demonstrated therapeutic value [23]. Extracts from Rheum palmatum have a high level of inhibitory activity against anti-Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 3C-like protease effects [24]. A polysaccharide extracted from Rheum tanguticum has been shown to affect 2,4,6-trinitrophene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and CD4+ T cells in rats [25]. Rhubarb has also demonstrated protective effects against experimental severe acute pancreatitis [26]. A study on anti-Oketsu activity indicates that rhubarb II has inhibitory effects against allergies [27]. Hexane extracts from Rheum undulatum not only decreases cell viability, thereby triggering apoptotic cell death in oral cancer, but also decreases the expression of specificity protein (Sp1) and its downstream protein, survivin [28].",

This herb has been used in TCM for the treatment of gallstones, inflammation, hepatitis, and osteomyelitis and is also a known vasorelaxant and diuretic [32]. It reportedly has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-ulcerogenic, anticancer, immunosuppressive [33], [34], [35], [36], and chemopreventive effects [37]. Emodin has also been reported to exert inhibitory effects on cell death in the human lung squamous carcinoma CH27 cell line [36], andhuman promyeloleukemic HL-60 cells induce apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 cascade independently of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [38]. Emodin-induced apoptosis in human cervical cancer Bu 25TK cells occurs through poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and the activation of caspase-9, but caspase-8 is not activated [39]. Moreover, emodin triggers apoptosis in human hepatoma HepG2/C3A, PLC/PRF/5, and SK-HEP-1 cells through a p53-dependent pathway [40]. In addition, emodin enhances arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis by generating ROS and inhibiting survival signaling [41], and gene expression alteration occurs in HeLa cells through the redox-dependent enhancement of arsenic cytotoxicity [42]. Our laboratory has proven that Aloe-emodin affects the expression of cytokines and the functions of leukocytes in Sprague Dawley rats [134]. Emodin affects murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro and enhances phagocytosis in leukemic mice in vivo\n[135].",

HIF-1 regulates genes that participate in angiogenesis, iron metabolism, glucose metabolism, and cell proliferation/survival [57]. The activity of HIF-1, especially its \u03b1 subunit, is controlled by the posttranslational modification of the amino acid residues in its subunits [57]. HIF-1 plays a key role in the cellular response to tumor hypoxia that poses a major problem to successful radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The targeting of HIF-1 is now considered to be a pivotal and efficient strategy for treating neurodegenerative maladies like Alzheimer\u2019s (AD), Parkinson\u2019s (PD), Huntington\u2019s Disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), etc. [58]. It has also been reported that emodin diminishes hypoxia-induced embryotoxicity by upregulating HIF-1 and intracellular superoxide dismutases in whole cultured mouse embryos [59]. As a novel inhibitor of HIF-1, emodin is an adjunct that boosts the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs used for the treatment of prostate cancer DU-145 cells, demonstrating overactivated HIF-1 and potent multidrug resistance (MDR) [60].",

Emodin has strong antioxidative and anticancer actions and abrogates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats [82]. Other reports have cited the antitumor and apoptosis-promoting properties of emodin, an anthraquinone derivative, against pancreatic cancer in mice by inhibiting Akt activation [12]. Emodin enhances apoptosis in cisplatin-induced gallbladder carcinomas in a ROS-dependent manner and suppresses survivin expression [83]. Emodin downregulates X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression [84] and inhibits NF-\u03baB against human pancreatic cancer [53], thereby enhancing the antitumor efficacy. Emodin induces apoptosis in the mouse microglial BV-2 cell line via Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) and eliminates inflammatory microglia, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects [85].",

Pyrazole emodin derivative also induce apoptosis in human cervical cancer cells via the activation of caspase-3 and -9 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [39]. Aloe-emodin induces apoptosis in human lung nonsmall carcinoma H460 cells through Cyclic Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and the p38 signaling pathway and induces human lung squamous cell carcinoma CH27 cell death via the Bax and Fas death pathways [92], [93]. Emodin not only successfully suppresses acute graft rejection in vivo, thereby prolonging the survival of the recipient rats by inhibiting hepatocellular apoptosis and modulating Th1/Th2 balance [94], but also mediates protection against acute myocardial infarction [46] in local ischemic myocardium.

In tumor formation, angiogenesis plays a vital role in development, reproduction, and wound repair. Many studies describe natural and synthetic compounds with antiangiogenic activities, attracting notice to their potential applications in cancer prevention and treatment [121]. Emodin reportedly inhibits tumor-associated angiogenesis through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation [122] and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-A\u2013induced angiogenesis by blocking receptor-2 (KDR/Flk-1) phosphorylation [69]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been studied for its role as a stimulant in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Several studies show that emodin and its anthraquinone derivatives inhibit the angiogenesis and proliferation [123] of primary cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells in the absence or presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or the presence of VEGF in a dose-dependent manner [124], [125]. Likewise, emodin inhibits VEGF receptors in human colon cancer cells [126], upregulates urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and promotes wound healing in human fibroblasts [127]. Emodin has been used in cancer therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases with anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR (receptor) effects [69], [126]. It has also been reported that emodin induces antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects in human pancreatic cancer SW1990 cells [128]. In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, emodin inhibits the level of MMP, thus inhibiting migration and invasion in vitro\n[129].",

Treating cancer with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation leads to complications, such as the development of tumor resistance to therapy (radio- or chemoresistance). Emodin might sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents by inhibiting the pathways that lead to treatment resistance. Emodin has also been found to protect against therapy-associated toxicities [131]. Emodin induces the mechanisms that involve the ROS-mediated suppression of MDR and HIF-11 [60]. Our studies demonstrate emodin\u2019s cytotoxic and protective effects in rat C6 glioma cells: the survival effects involve Mdr1a, MRP2, MRP3, MRP6, and NF-\u03baB [132]. Emodin may be involved in reducing the glutathione level and downregulating MDR-related protein 1 (MRP1) expression in gallbladder SGC996 cancer cells. In tumor-bearing mice, it has also been indicated that co-treatment with emodin/cisplatin suppresses tumor growth in vivo by increasing cancer cell apoptosis and downregulating MRP1 expression [61], [133].",

Based on our observations and the results of previously reported studies, emodin can act as an anticancer agent against many human cancer cell lines through its effects across multiple signaling pathways. Over these past several years, our laboratory has evaluated agents that affect cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, metastasis, and angiogenesis in human cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo, in addition to tumor cell growth, invasion, migration, and metastasis that are also involved in angiogenesis. Based on these observations regarding the effects of emodin, these findings may offer information that could be used in the design of novel therapeutic agents that inhibit tumor cells. Accordingly, we also summarize the pharmacology of emodin as a possible anticancer agent (Fig. 2\n).",
