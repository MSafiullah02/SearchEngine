A recently-developed method for the direct detection of viral antigens in nasopharyngeal specimens by radio-immunoassay was more sensitive than complement futation serology, especially in patients aged less than six months. Viral diagnosis was reached using this new method alone in 43% of infections caused by RSV and in 27% of infections caused by other viruses. In children under six months, RSV were found in 89% by direct antigen detection and in 22% by serology. We suggest that direct antigen detection should be used as the primary virological method in small children with lower respiratory tract infections. The aetiological agents were the same in cases with and without expiratory dficulties, RSV being found in about 40% of children in both instances. It is concluded that host factors are critical to the development of expiratory difficulties.

            "text": "An association between expiratory difficulties and respiratory viral infections in infants and small children is well documented. In children under the age of two years, the infectious agent most commonly reported is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses are also frequently found (1) (2) (3) . In older children, and during repeated wheezing episodes, rhinoviruses have been most commonly found (1) (2) (3) . In a recent study (4) , coronaviruses were a frequent finding in small children with wheezy bronchitis. Why some infants and children wheeze during respiratory infections, especially those caused by RSV, is still obscure. Some authors emphasize the role of the virus itself in the production of airways damage (5-7), others believe in the importance of host factors, either bronchial hyper-reactivity (%lo), atopy (1 1-14) or both (15). Despite representative epidemiological studies on the incidence and aetiology of various lower respiratory syndromes (1, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) viral discovery rates have been fairly low because of the low sensitivity of the serological and virus isolation methods used. Recently developed methods for direct viral antigen detection in clinical specimens using radio-immunoassay (RIA) (21-26) or enzyme immunoassay procedures (21) (22) (23) 25, (27) (28) (29) are more sensitive and have already proved useful, especially in small children.",

The second most common agent was adenovirus, found in 9% of cases on first admission. Parainfluenza viruses and M . pneumoniae were found in 4% of cases. No infections caused by influenza viruses or coronaviruses were found. Direct antigen detection by NPS-RIA was compared with routine CF serology for diagnosing RSV infections ( Table 4) . Samples for both methods were available for 46 of the 52 RSV-positive children. Of these, 78% were positive by NPS-RIA and 57% by CF serology. Thus 43% of the RSV findings were based on NPS-RIA alone. Direct antigen detection was especially useful in infants below the age of six months by whom RSV was detected in 89% Table 4 ",

In two representative population studies, an aetiological agent was found using viral and mycoplasmal culture in 21-24% of cases (1, 16) and using standard CF serology in 36% (16). In the present study, an aetiological agent was found more often, in 63% of respiratory infections and 48% of pneumonias with expiratory difficulties on first admission and in 46% and 37% on all admissions, respectively. There are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, an RSV outbreak occurred at the beginning of the study period. During two autumn months, a viral aetiology was found in 76% of infections, mostly involviiig RSV. After the RSV epidemic, a viral diagnosis was established in only 19% of cases. Secondly, direct viral antigen detection was used in addition to serology. A viral aetiology was established by NPS-RIA alone in 43% of RSV infections and in 27% of infections caused by other viruses. The antigen detection method was especially useful in infants aged below six months.",

In two recent studies in which NPS-RIA was compared with a sensitive serological test involving virus specific IgG antibody, the sensitivity of NPS-RIA was 78% in RSV infections (26) and 80% in adenovirus infections (25). However, the relative sensitivities of the methods also depend on the age of the study population, as has clearly been shown in this study. Direct antigen detection is especially valuable in infants under six months of age, on the basis of the present data and that of previous studies (26). To improve the resolution of serology, the CF test used in this study should be supplemented by the newer sensitive radio-immunoassay or enzyme immunoassay methods which allow assay of antibodies of different immunoglobulin classes separately (25, 26).",

This conflicts with the view that the RSV itself has a particular tendency to cause wheezing.
