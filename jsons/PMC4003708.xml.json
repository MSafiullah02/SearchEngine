It is mildly sedating and also used to treat dysentery and chronic hepatitis.[671415]Sc. baicalensis has distinct effects in the treatment of inflammatory diseases; it alleviates inflammation by decreasing the expression of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and IL-12, and the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).[516] In Xie xin herbal decoction, huang qin, in combination with huang lian, inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production in vitro and in vivo in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Oroxylin A, which is a flavonoid found in dried root of Sc. baicalensis, has also shown good anti-inflammatory effect.[1718] Moreover, Sc. baicalensis has antibacterial effect against Helicobacter pylori as well as inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli B, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[715]",

Traditionally, it has been used to drain fire, detoxify and disinfect, stop bleeding, cure eczema, burns, and ulcer, and to descend yang.[711131419] The main pharmacodynamic properties have long been recognized in the treatment of intestinal infections including acute gastroenteritis, cholera, and bacillary dysentery. It also used for treating various diseases including skin diseases, conjunctivitis, otitis, and hypertension.[141920]C. chinensis has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects through different mechanisms. It inhibits TNF-induced Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) signaling in human keratinocytes by blocking the NF-kB\u2013dependent pathway. It also decreases Th17 cytokine secretion and differentiation by activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and down-regulation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor \u03d2t (ROR\u03b3t) expression. It also reduces Th1 cytokine secretion and differentiation by inhibition of protein 38 (p38) mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation along with down-regulation of STAT1 and STAT4 activities.[2122] In combination with other herbs, C. chinensis exhibited a good anti-inflammatory effect; the ethanol extract from Zuojin Pill inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 expression by preventing the nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB p50 and p65 subunits in RAW 264.7 cells.[23] Another Chinese medicinal formula, IBS-20, containing C. chinensis decreased LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from JAWS II dendritic cells and also blocked the interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3)-induced drop in transepithelial electric resistance which is an index of permeability, in fully differentiated Caco-2 monolayer.[24]C. chinensis has also significant antimicrobial activity against a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans, helminths, and Chlamydia, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus dysenteriae, and Sa. cerevisiae.[72125] Berberine, the major active component of C. chinensis, was found to be bactericidal on V. cholera and capable of inhibiting bacterial adherence to mucosal or epithelial surfaces.[26]",

It has inhibitory effect against H. pylori and Porphyromonas gingivalis,[15] and it treats candidal septic arthritis.[35] It also has antimicrobial effect against oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus.[6]",

Traditionally, it used to treat carbuncle, disperse lumps, and stagnation, and to expel wind and heat.[111314] The fruit of F. suspensa has potent pharmacological actions such as antiviral, choleretic, antipyretic, hepatoprotective, antiemetic, and diuretic effects.[1427]F. suspensa alleviates inflammation by reducing the anaphylactic antibodies, mast cell degranulation, and histamine release. It also significantly suppresses \u03b2-conglycinin\u2013induced T lymphocyte proliferation and IL-4 synthesis.[3637]F. suspensa fruit inhibits NO production and iNOS gene expression by its active components rengyolone, dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans, as well as its butanol fraction of the aqueous extract. It also inhibits TNF-\u03b1 and COX-2 production.[383940] Another bioactive agent, arctigenin, inhibits increase in capillary permeability and leukocyte recruitment into inflamed tissues, by reduction of the vascular leakage and cellular events through inhibition of production of inflammatory mediators such as NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).[383941] Moreover, F. suspensa inhibits NF-kB nucleus translocation through reduction in I-kappa-B (IkB) phosphorylation and suppression of NF-kB\u2013regulated proteins, and also reduces the activation of MAPKs.[394041] Various studies have reported the antimicrobial effect of F. suspensa. It has potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, Sta. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Str. mutans, and Po. gingivalis and antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Penicillium citrinum, Aspergillus niger, and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis.[642]F. suspensa suppresses influenza A virus\u2013induced RANTES secretion by human bronchial epithelial cells to stop accumulation of inflammatory cells in the infective sites, which has been reported to play a crucial role in the progression of chronic inflammation and multiple sclerosis after viral infection.[27]",

Various studies have revealed that HCCHs are used for treating inflammatory and microbial diseases due to their multiple active ingredients. Since inflammation is the result of interaction of various inflammatory mediators, HCCHs can exert anti-inflammatory effect through different mechanisms of action including inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, blocking of inflammatory signaling, and interfering with chemokines [Table 1]. Moreover, HCCHs have also shown antimicrobial effect through inhibition of microbial adherence to mucosal or epithelial surfaces, inhibition of endotoxin shock, and selective inhibition of microbial growth [Table 2]. Collectively, all the above mechanisms are likely to be important for the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity of HCCHs. This review reveals the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects of HCCHs, in general, from different aspects and through different mechanisms. This may be linked to their action of removing heat and fire and counteracting toxicity. Therefore, further studies are needed on the collection of HCCHs to find the detailed mechanism of action of herbs in this group and to determine whether their nature of clearing away heat is related to their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects according to Chinese medical theory, rather than focusing on simple gradient or single herbs for the assessment of effective therapeutic drugs from HCCHs.",
