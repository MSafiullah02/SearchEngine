Previously, Arriaga et al., [21] detected presence of mycobacterial DNA by PCR in situ in macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial and bronchial epithelial cells of experimental infected mice after 30 days post-infection, indicating these cells can be infected by M. tuberculosis. In the PCLTS we observed bacilli in contact with epithelial cells as well as intracellular bacteria in macrophages. Bacteria were easily located in alveolar space and close or in contact with type II pneumocytes. Although we did not find evidence of intracellular bacteria in these cells, it cannot be discarded cell invasion occurs. Our model analyze early stages of infection up to 48 h and further ultrastructure analysis is needed to confirm infection of pneumocytes in PCLTS. Detailed comparisons of mycobacterial infections in PCLTS to infections by other species may reveal common mechanisms to human infection. The close proximity of mycobacteria to pneumocytes type II in PCLTS may represent a relevant and preferential location to the infection process as it is well known that mycobacteria invade human lung epithelial cells [22], [23], [24], [25], [26].",

This movement is similar to the increase of lymphocytes and plasmacytic cells in infection areas with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae observed by Ebsen et al. [15] in mice PCLTS. Migration of immune cells is a signal that PCLTS remain immunologically active. Henjakovic et al. [27] reported that immunoactive substances such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), and dexamethasone induced the characteristic responses to these substances in PCLTS. These facts support this model as suitable to test immune responses against pathogens. Further studies on the phenotype of the immune cells in PCLTS will determine what kind of cells interact directly with Mycobacterium. One advantage of this system is the possibility to add exogenous specific immune cell types to the PCLTS and analyze the role of each cell linage during the challenge with microbes.",

Peaks of expression were at 6 h after infection with an increase of 2.62 and 3.38 fold for M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, respectively. Differences in expression are not due to differential growth of strains as differences in the number of CFU per slice were not statistically significant as shown in Table 1, but due to differential TNF-\u03b1 induction by the infecting strains. These results agree with those reported by Wong et al. [28] where they found that virulent strains produced a lower induction of TNF-\u03b1 than non-virulent strains. These findings suggest that virulent strains may inhibit cellular mechanism to evade innate immune response. An example is the suppression of IL-12 production and negative regulation of apoptosis in host macrophages [29], [30], [31] which would allow mycobacteria to survive inside the cells protected from immune response, helping further tissue dissemination.",
