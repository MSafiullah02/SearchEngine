Upon inclusion, the participants were questioned by Arabic-speaking investigators using a standardized pretravel questionnaire, which included demographic data and medical history. A posttravel questionnaire, which collected travel-associated diseases, vaccination status, and compliance with protective behaviors, was completed by a French Muslim Arabic-speaking medical doctor who traveled with the pilgrims. This survey was administered during a face-to-face interview just prior to returning to France or via telephone after returning to France. If we were unable to contact the pilgrim after 3 attempts, we considered the pilgrim lost to follow-up. Health problems that occurred during the stay in the KSA were monitored and recorded by the medical doctor. A cough was defined as the occurrence of a cough with or without sputum. Subjective fever was defined as a pilgrim's report of feeling feverish. For the purpose of this study, influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined according to the presence of the triad of a cough, sore throat, and subjective fever [10]. This study was approved by our local ethics committee under number 13-017 and by the Saudi ethics committee. It was performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practices recommended by the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. All participants gave written informed consent.",

In our study, HRV was the most frequent virus detected from symptomatic pilgrims (27%). This result is in accordance with studies conducted worldwide where HRV has been recognized as the most frequent virus responsible for the common cold in adults [26, 27]. This is not unexpected, as rhinoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are more resistant in the environment than enveloped viruses. Symptoms of HRV infection are generally mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, lower respiratory symptoms associated with HRV infection are prominent in patients who have underlying asthma or other chronic lung disease [28]. In the present study, 7.8% of pilgrims reported chronic respiratory diseases; therefore, prevention must be reinforced in this high-risk population. There have been arguments [26] regarding whether rhinoviruses are spread chiefly from infected person to healthy individuals by direct contact to the fingers of healthy individuals by a handshake or indirect contact from the hands of an infected person to an intermediary surface [29], or through the aerosol route [30]. Our findings showed that more frequent hand-washing was significantly associated with feverishness and symptoms of ILI and with a higher prevalence of respiratory viruses. However, these results may indicate a reverse causation, as pilgrims with symptoms or who believe themselves to be at greater risk may have washed their hands more frequently. A recent study found that hand disinfection did not reduce HRV infection or HRV-related common cold illnesses [31]. The prevalence of HRV paralleled the increase of respiratory clinical symptoms, with a higher prevalence in pilgrims sampled in Mecca City during the first week of the pilgrimage. Influenza viruses ranked second after HRV among symptomatic pilgrims (10.0%), and 3 patients with influenza virus infection reported receiving a seasonal influenza vaccination prior to the Hajj pilgrimage.",

However, some symptomatic pilgrims were found to be negative for respiratory viruses. For those sampled at Mina and Medina, this was likely due to delayed medical consultation, as the specimen was collected several weeks after the onset of symptoms. Second, symptom occurrence was collected retrospectively and was based on self-reporting; thus, the date of the medical consultation did not necessarily correspond to the self-reported date of the onset of respiratory symptoms. Third, samples that were obtained at the beginning of the pilgrimage in the KSA were stored at room temperature (20\u00b0C) for periods up to 30 days before being processed, which may have been resulted in the degradation of genetic material. This may have likely contributed to underestimating the frequencies of infection. Alternative strategies to better preserve the samples must be considered, among which ethanol or nucleic acid lysis buffer [34] could be used. Fourth, a technical point is that HRV sequencing was not performed to determine how often new HRV infections were acquired during the stay in the KSA. Finally, we cannot demonstrate that the viruses detected from nasal swabs were responsible for the symptoms, as nasal carriage in asymptomatic pilgrims was observed in some cases, and symptoms may have resulted from infection by other viruses [35], or possibly bacteria [36], that were not investigated in our study.",
