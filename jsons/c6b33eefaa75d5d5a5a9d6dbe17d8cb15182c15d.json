COVID-19 epidemic usually starts from relatively few imported cases and spreads quickly through exponential growth with high reproduction numbers. At unchecked growth rates, a significant percentage of the country population would be infected before the disease would subside. However, this growth rate only continues until effective measures, such as lockouts or social distancing policies, are introduced, changing the dynamics of the epidemics substantially, with infection rates rarely reaching a significant percentage of the whole population in the first wave Flaxman et al. (2020) . In this study, we have estimated a variety of indicators characteristic for different stages of COVID-19 epidemics, also adjusting for time since the beginning of the epidemics in each country, and found that several key indicators show weak, but statistically significant, associations with BCG vaccination status.

These time periods reflect R in various early stages of the epidemic, longer periods meaning slower spread of the disease. Note, that C10 numbers are likely unreliable (due to initial problems in establishing testing and reporting policies in each country), and there are only few countries that reached 1000 reported deaths before our data set cutoff. Also note that if we assume a constant case fatality rate within a specific time period (typically 6-10 days) and a specific country, and also assume exponential growth in cases within this time period, the numbers D10 and D100 do not actually reflect the death rate, but instead only depend on the underlying value of R. Death reports are likely more accurate than case reports, which are much more affected by testing and reporting policies in each country. On average, all of these time periods are slightly longer in countries with recent universal BCG policies, with statistically significant results for D10 (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.02).",

Polynomial growth has been also confirmed for multiple other countries (Merrin, 2020) and even though the initial spread in many countries is approximately exponential, it is followed by a steady polynomial growth and in a longer run by an exponential decay (Komarova and Wodarz, 2020) .",

            "text": "For a possible explanation of the transition from exponential to polynomial growth, it is natural to look into self-imposed or government-imposed social distancing measures. These measures transform the structure of virus transmitting contact networks in a population, possibly to small-world network structures or even fractal networks. In contrast to small-world networks, social networks under standard conditions contain a significant fraction of nodes with high number of connections (that correspond to potential superspreaders). Interestingly, polynomial growth of the number of infections in time in well connected scale-free networks emerges naturally as a consequence of infection initially reaching the highly connected nodes and their neighbors, while their isolation or recovery significantly reduces the interconnectivity of the residual network (Szab\u00f3, 2020) . Theoretical study of the infection spread in scale-free networks by Vazquez (2006) leads to an explicit formula for the number of infected individuals in time in a form of PGED. The formula contains three key parameters: p -the coefficient of the polynomial growth (not necessary an integer), \u03c4 -the rate of decay of the exponential tail (1/\u03c4 is an analogue to the rate of removal of individuals from the infected class to inactive recovered class in the traditional SIR-type models), and A -the constant prefactor (scaling the total population). Based on the value of these parameters, it is straightforward to determine Nmax, the number of infected at the peak of the epidemic, which is independent of the choice of the reference time for the start of the infection. These parameters were obtained by the best fit on the linear scale to the data in each of the considered countries/regions. Interestingly, we have found that the parameters \u03c4 and Nmax significantly differ between countries split into two groups-with and without recent universal BCG vaccination policies ( Figure 2 ). The \u03c4 parameter shifts to the higher values, signifying higher recovery rate in the countries with recent universal BCG vaccination policies (Mann-Whitney U-test P = 0.04). In addition, these countries have generally lower numbers of infected cases at the peak of the epidemic (Nmax) corrected for underreporting (Mann-Whitney U-test P = 0.002).",

In East Germany, the policies regarding BCG vaccination followed Eastern Bloc practices, with universal vaccination policy in place between 1951 and 1998. In West Germany, the vaccination has been introduced in 1961, but in 1975 it was discontinued in favor of vaccinating high risk groups only. [The information has been reconstructed from the notes in BCG atlas, however we were not able to confirm this from other sources.] In the present crisis, the whole Germany follows similar practices in case reporting and treatment of the disease. Interestingly, East Germany exhibits much lower estimates of R than West Germany at the corresponding phases of the epidemic (R100 = 2.8, R100+10 = 1.55 in East Germany vs. R100 = 3.14, R100+10 = 2.76 in West Germany; see also Figure 3 ).

Most of these studies have used indicators that were quite straightforward, such as the number of reported cases per million inhabitants on a particular date. Here, we have instead chosen a variety of indicators that reflect characteristics of various phases of the epidemics in each country, and moreover, these indicators were implicitly or explicitly adjusted according to the time from the beginning of the epidemic in each country. In fact, we hypothesize that such time adjustment is one of the key factors in such an analysis considering what we know about the spread of COVID-19. In our data, we have observed several statistically significant associations, and we conclude that there is an association between BCG vaccination policy and spread of COVID-19. However, whether this association is causal or is merely an observed correlation due to some other common factor, is impossible to say. Moreover, most observed shifts in various coefficients are rather small and while the universal BCG vaccination policy may have had a positive impact in some of the countries, the observed impact clearly cannot replace effective policies such as lockdowns and social distancing measures which currently constitute the most effective weapon against the epidemic. At best, the existence of universal BCG vaccination policy may have provided a few days time for governments to effectively institute such policies.",

The instantaneous reproduction number has a gamma-distributed prior and during the inference is assumed to be constant within each seven-day sliding window to yield an estimate at the end of the window. The infectiousness is approximated by the distribution of the serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of a case and the onset of symptoms of secondary cases infected by the primary case. Following previous work (Churches, 2020) , we have set the distribution of serial intervals as a discrete gamma distribution with mean of 5 days and standard deviation of 3.4 days.

For consistency, we have truncated the data to reduce the impact of testing irregularities during the initial onset of epidemic. Therefore we start the data from the day when a certain number of active cases N a was reached. The threshold N a was chosen in proportion to the population in the country to reduce effects of randomness in reporting and to account for the spreading potential. Italy served as the reference with a threshold of 200 cases (threshold chosen was always at least 10).",
