Simultaneously C-terminus region of G interacts with NiV-F protein, whose two hydrophobic N-terminal alpha helical heptad repeat domains (HR-1, HR-2) form a six-helical bundle structure that transverses through cell membrane of the host initiating pH independent class I type membrane fusion (Figure 2).31, 32, 33 After the viral entrance through apical region, it replicates within the cell, sorting of proteins such as F and G on infected cell surface, is further destined for infection could also be regarded as markers.32, 33 Unlike G, precursor form of F protein, F0 get lodged within the membrane and activated through endocytosis followed by cathepsin L mediated endosomal degradation to form mature F1/2 (Cifuentes-Mu\u00f1oz et al 2017).34\n",

This has been seen at 14 h of post infection (p.i) which is the earliest time needed for protein detection in in vivo study.30 The cell\u2013cell fusion can be between epithelial cell and stromal cell, heterologous fusion or between two epithelial cells, homologous fusion (Figure 2).35 After disrupting monolayer epithelial cells the newly formed virus buds out from the apical side of the multinucleated epithelial cells. This vectorial release of virus is confirmed by the preferential localization of viral F, G and necessary for budding, M protein on the apical side (88%, 86%, 95% of total G, F and M respectively), which can be seen after 24 h p.i.30 The released virus can either infect the immune cells of secondary lymphoid organs (Mucosal Associated Lymphoid Tissues [MALT], Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissues [GALT]) which are present just under the layer of mucosal epithelia cells. They might also contribute towards impairing antiviral activity by inhibiting synthesis of IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 and reducing expression of cytokines involved in inflammatory process like CCL4, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1. Again IFN induced antiviral genes such as MxA, ISG54 and repression of viral antigen presenting class-I MHC molecules might be another output (Figure 3, D).36, 37 The unconstrained virus could infiltrate the blood stream attaching to leukocytes such as macrophages, dendritic cells, CD6+CD8+ T cells, NK cells causing systemic infection and multiple organ failure in detailed brain, lungs, liver, heart, kidney and spleen ((Figure 1).38 Histopathological lesions are necrosis and vasculitis in non-CNS organs. In case of CNS organs, perivascular cuffing, parenchymal inflammation and neurophangia are most common clinical signs, but are not exclusive for NiV infection and may also be detected in other acute viral encephalitis (Figure 1).36, 39\n",

These dimmers are precursor molecule of IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 gene transcription factor.48, 49 Hence inhibitions of STAT1 and STAT2 interaction result in the absence of antiviral activity. Protein P, V and W interact with STAT1 with their amino terminal domain while only protein V can interact with STAT2.37 Re-localization of non-phosphorylated STAT1 from its typically cytoplasmic location by protein W also makes its unavailability for STAT dimer formation and hence inhibition of IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 gene transcription factor formation (Figure 3, D.3).37 The viral C protein which is predominantly localized in cytoplasm and partly in nucleus is responsible for enveloped viral budding and release by recruiting host ESCRT pathway.50, 51 The C terminal domain of NiV-C, as it possesses homology in its sequence with host protein Vps28 could interact directly with TSG 101, an adaptor molecule between ESCRT I and ESCRT II. However, the reciprocal action among ESCRT I\u2013NiV C and ESCRT II is not fully understood.50 But it has been speculated that viral C protein interacts with M protein present in the inner leaflet of plasma membrane and thereby direct vectorial release of virus particles (Figure 3, B.2).50, 52\n",

The low neutralizing ability of the produced antibodies as confirmed by the increasing level of serum antibodies gives an idea of studying effect of passive immunization against NiV. Intraperitoneal injection of polyclonal as well as monoclonal (mAb) anti-F and anti-G, separately shows that anti-F and anti-G mAb are more efficient in neutralizing NiV viral infection as compared to polyclonal Ab, with anti-F mAb having high degree of antiviral activity than anti-G mAb.54 A recent hit on broad-spectrum small molecule antiviral purine analogue previously mentioned Favipiravir (T-705) which inhibits NIV and HeV replication in vitro with a minimal cytotoxic effect of highest concentration tested, having a CC50 value of >1000 \u03bcl (as observed in Hamster model) has provided a way to fight against the cytopathic effect of deadly NiV, HeV like paramyxoviruses.6\n",

Numerous evaluations of the NPs to develop a novel strategy to either annihilate or ameliorate the severity of infection had already been carried out. To date the efficiency of AgNPs as an antiviral has been checked in Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, 2, 3, Feline Calicivirus, Poliovirus type-1, Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), Murine norovirus-1, Avian influenza A virus subtype H7N3, Coxsackievirus B3, Infectious bursal disease virus and S. cerevisiae dsRNA viruses (Table 1\n). The AgNPs based mechanism for viral inhibition or virucidal activity varies virus to virus. For example Lara et al elucidated the antiviral efficacy of commercially available AgNPs against HIV-1 and some resistant strain such as IIIB, Eli, Beni, 96USSN20, Bal, BCF01, AZTRV, NNRTIRV, PIRV, 3TCRV, and SaquinavirRV along with NP's mode of action.57 Normally gp120 interaction with host receptor CD4 and associated co-receptor results in further conformational changes in virus, exposing gp41 which concordantly interacts and releases viral core into cytoplasm.58 Their findings suggested that AgNPs impedes CD4-dependent virion binding, merging and pathogenesis by interacting with viral gp120 in both cell-free and cell-associated virus.58 In case of HSV-2 the viral inhibition is portrayed by interacting with sulfhydryl group present on the membrane glycoproteins which prevent viral internalization. In Peste des petits ruminants' virus the NPs act by interacting with virion surface and core protein, impairing viral replication and entry.59, 60 Likewise in dsRNA viruses the AgNPs after interaction with viral genome, the NPs were found to inhibit viral replication.61 The antiviral efficacies of AgNPs by these modes of viral entry or attachment inhibition or viral replication inhibition have also been evaluated in other viruses shown in Table 1.",

But recently developed ternary I-III-VI QDs contain elements in different form, here \u201cI\u201d represents cupper (Cu) or silver (Ag), \u201cIII\u201d represents gadolinium (Ga) or indium (In) and \u201cVI\u201d represents sulfur (S) or selenium (Se).94 Owing to their extremely small size ranging from 2 to 10 nm QDs are well appreciated and used in biomedical sector as they could conveniently cross the BBB in conjugation with a therapeutic molecule.94, 95 Mahajan et al showed that fluorescent quantum rods (QRs) a form of QD in conjugation with transferring, a targeting molecule and HAAT (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) drug Sequinavir could freely cross an in vitro model of BBB. They also showed that the nano-formulation showed promising antiviral activity against HIV-1.96 Viral detection by QD based approaches is exceedingly escalating research of virology. Norouzi et al developed a cadmium\u2013tellurium QD in association with a biotin acceptor and NH2-receptor probes with target DNA for recognition of human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) in vitro.97 Likewise, there are many other evaluations where QDs have been utilized either as therapeutics or for in vitro diagnosis of viral pathogens.",

Recently, Joshy et al have demonstrated that amine functionalized polymeric gelatin NPs loaded with zidovudine against HIV. Simultaneously, they have also conducted hemolysis and aggregation studies to gain deeper understanding of other compatible properties of NPs. From their research they summarized that drug conjugated NPs showed promising biocompatibility and antiviral activity.103 Deng et al on the other hand took a different approach by developing a universal influenza vaccine with double-layered protein NPs composed of tetramaric Matrix protein 2 (M2e) at its core and headless Hemagglutinin (HA) coating at its surface. The protein vaccine could induce substantial and prolonged immunity with complete protection of BALB/c mice against verity influenza A virus challenges.104 With the contemporary improvement made in nanoscience it is certain that these impeccable polymeric NPs in near future will be soon used for the development of a novel antiviral against divergent array of infectious viruses like NiV.",

In a study Joshy et al again had developed zidovudine loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/ stearic acid (SA)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) NPs and have determined the in vitro drug loading, controlled discharge, hemocompatibility and non-toxicity in murine neuro-2a and HeLa cells under HIV challenge.106 Similarly, Gao et al designed a nanostructured nanolipid carrier loaded with podophyllotoxin (POD) evaluated drug release parameters hemocompatibility and non-toxic viral inhibition in VK2/E6E7 cell lines challenged with Human papillomavirus (HPV).107 Lipid based NPs in both of its form that is solid-lipid NPs and nanostructured lipid nanocarriers could serve as an exceptional addition to the group of vehicles needed for effective antiviral delivery.

Current investigations, where efforts have been made towards diagnosis or detection of the viruses have been documented by many investigators from different corners of the globe. Starting from the primary application that is detection, Marjom\u00e4ki et al earlier had reported an accurate and precise enteroviruses labeling procedure and described it at the atomic level. Here they reported water-soluble thiol-stabilized gold cluster or chemically called Au102 (para-mercaptobenzoic acid)44 cluster which by its metal core could covalently bind to cysteine molecule nearer to the surface of the virus. Through the above procedure enteroviruses echovirus 1 and coxsackievirus B3 viruses were precisely detected.126 Ahmed et al have synthesized a multifunctional nanohybrid where AuNPs are first bonded with CNT surface, and then specific antibody (anti-influenza A virus HA H1 antibody) is conjugated to it. The nanohybrid displayed oxidative catalysis of 3, 3\u2032, 5, 5\u2032-tetramethyl-benzidine (TMB) by H2O2 gave rise to a deep blue color, the optical density of which depended on concentration of virus.127 Lately, Oh et al developed an ultrasensitive magnetic nanozyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of H1N1 virus. The assay had two major components, the silica-shelled magnetic nanobeads (MagNBs) for binding and preliminary detection of the virus, and a gold nanozyme (AuNZ) an enzyme-like acting molecule for amplification of the preliminary detection signals. Together in combination the nanosystem could even detect virus concentration up to femtogram per milliliter.128 There are a number of examples where hybridized nano-based systems showed promising results in viral detection; some of them have been listed in Table 3.",

Further, development of an antiviral within a stipulated time is actually a race against time. Under such case formulation of an antiviral that is biocompatible, non-immunogenic and non-toxic is of the critical requirement to which hybridized nanoparticulated systems are an appreciable option. It is because of the promising antiviral activity of these systems that has been portrayed by various scientific investigators. Ryoo et al had reported iron-oxide NP-based delivery of DNAzyme as a therapeutic for treating hepatitis C infection. Here, the magnetic NPs were linked to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and functional DNAzyme which could induce knockdown of HVC gene NS3 (non-structural protein 3) encoding viral helicase and protease.129 Orlowski et al developed tannic acid functionalized AgNPs of specific size range that could reduce HSV-2 infectivity by blocking viral attachment, penetration as well as viral spread; provided a prior direct attachment of the nano-system with the virus is a basic requirement.130 Chen et al compared the antiviral activity of both graphene oxide (GO) and GO conjugated AdNPs against both coronavirus (FCoV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Their analyses showed GO in its non-conjugated and conjugated form had different effect on two different taken viruses. Overall they concluded that GO in its conjugated form that is GO-AgNPs could inhibit both the virus that is FCoV and IBDV effectively.131 After diagnosis and therapy the next arising huddle is drug resistance that soon must be focused and acted accordingly. With this intention Li et al, after much evaluations and strategic understanding the drawbacks of conventional and nano-based antiviral, designed nanoparticulated system by decorating amantadine (AM) on surface of selenium NPs (SeNPs). Their designed Se-AM nanosystem could reverse the drug resistance induced by H1N1 virus.132 Similarly, there are many other investigations which orchestrate the experimental efficiencies of hybrid nanoparticulated systems as antivirals listed in Table 3. Despite the heterogeneous research and investigations exploiting multiple ways and means to diagnose, inhibit the virus by a nano-based therapeutic agent or reverse the drug resistance, still there is hardly any sign of these applications concerning NiV.",

Additionally, detection of a diverse array of viruses seems promising with this approach, which is also an advantage over antigen detection and nucleic acid detection. In order to preserve medically relevant viruses, maintenance of heterogeneous types of cultured cell is required as a support, which is a major limitation of this technique. Viral recovery through cell culture becomes difficult when the viral growth is slow; antigen detection in such cases is much useful. Rapidity and non-requirement of viral viability render immense plasticity in management and shifting of the specimens, which together may be considered as the major advantages of the technique. Fluorescent Antibody (FA) staining, Immunoperoxidase staining and Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) etc. are crucial techniques involved in these methods. But viruses with antigenic heterogeneity and lack of cross-reacting antigens are tedious to be detected even through this technique. Drastic transformation in diagnosis has emerged with the development of analysis based on PCR. This transformation has allowed the detection of specific viral sequence with uttermost sensitivity. More specifically, viral RNA could be easily detected only by amalgamating reverse transcriptase with conventional PCR analysis. Real-Time PCR assay runs on highly sophisticated automated instruments; exploiting optical excitation systems and dyes labeled with fluorescent molecules has tremendously reduced time and probable contamination. The versatility of nucleic acid detection is growing day-by-day and will be in future with the progression of scientific innovation. Finally, the efficacy serology the traditional method viral diagnosis cannot be disregarded. The technique is exclusively promising for unambiguous antiviral immunity determination, but when speculated on clinical utility, assessment of acute and convalescent antibody titers, could be one of its limitations.133 In case of NiV detection these mentioned detection techniques may be fruitful.",

The conventional means of viral inhibition or treatment / therapy have been documented under the topic \u201cTherapeutics against NiV\u201d. The nano-based approaches like the use of acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCTs) made of photoactivated molecules (Protoporphyrin IX) to inactivate H3N2 virus have been demonstrated by Banerjee et al.87 The possible molecular mechanism involved is ROS-based inactivation through which oxidation of viral protein (neuraminidase [NA] and hemagglutinin [HA]) might have taken place; single stranded break in viral genome and protein-RNA crosslinking might have also been a possibility. Similar nano-based approach including pH or photothermal medium accompanied with ROS-based inactivation of NiV could also be evaluated in vitro. Inhibition of viral binding with the host cell surface receptor could also be achieved by preventing viral binding of gp120 and CD4 attachment. In a study, Vijayakumar and Ganesan have demonstrated this mode of inhibition of HIV-1 virus entry using AuNPs in vitro.62 Similarly, NPs with the capacity to interact with NiV surface glycoproteins like G and F could prove to be promising candidates as viral entry inhibitors. Inhibition of virus mediated accumulation of ROS, activation of AKT, and p53 phosphorylation could also be a strategy for inhibiting the entry of infectious viruses. Li et al demonstrated this strategy of H1N1 viral inhibition using oseltamivir (OTV) decorated SeNPs (Se@OTV).134 This strategy could be effectively evaluated in vitro in case of NiV inhibition. Likewise modulation of viral transcription using MWCTs- ribavirin by Zhu et al,135 targeted binding on conservative regions on viral genome using TiO2NPs and polylysine (PL)-containing oligonucleotides nanocomposite by Levina et al.136 and silencing viral replication with the help of solid lipid NPs by Torrecilla et al137\netc. all point in the same direction (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). Though the efficiency of NPs as an antiviral agent against NiV is yet to be evaluated; still it could be roughly speculated that these investigations are direct representation of the possibility that NPs holds an enormous potential as an antiviral agent against NiV described in Figure 4.",

A brief introduction of various NPs in inorganic, organic and hybrid forms would be helpful in determining their suitability to be evaluated as diagnostics or therapeutics. Finally the overview of major antiviral approaches that have already been studied is represented in tabular format, which could help to strategize possible novel antiviral approach.",
