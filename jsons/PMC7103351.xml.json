Based on genotypic and serological characteristics, coronaviruses were classified into three distinct groups (Brian and Baric, 2005, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Ziebuhr, 2004). As a result of the unique mechanism of viral replication, coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Such a high recombination rate, coupled with the infidelity of the polymerases of RNA viruses, may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches (Herrewegh et al., 1998, Woo et al., 2006c).",

In the recent two years, at least 10 previously unrecognized coronaviruses from bats were also described in Hong Kong and mainland China (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005b, Poon et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2006a, Woo et al., 2006d), suggesting that bats play an important role in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses.",

Recently, we have described the discovery of a SARS-CoV-like virus, bat SARS coronavirus (bat-SARS-CoV), in Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2005). Similar viruses have also been found in other species of horseshoe bats in mainland China (Li et al., 2005b), suggesting that horseshoe bats are reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses. However, genome sequence comparison of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from horseshoe bats and human/civet SARS-CoV showed that they shared only 88\u201392% nucleotide identities. More importantly, the amino acid sequence identities between the spike (S) proteins of bat and human/civet viruses were only 78\u201380% (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005b, Ren et al., 2006). Therefore, events such as mutation and/or recombination would have occurred during the evolution of these SARS-CoV-like viruses before the possible emergence of direct progenitors of SARS-CoV capable of infecting palm civets and subsequently humans.",

Interestingly, a novel group 1 coronavirus, bat coronavirus HKU2 (bat-CoV HKU2), was identified in Chinese horseshoe bats in addition to bat-SARS-CoV in our previous surveillance studies (Lau et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2006d). To better understand the epidemiology and evolution of bat-CoV HKU2 and explore possible recombination events between this group 1 coronavirus and bat-SARS-CoV that could have led to the emergence of SARS-CoV, we conducted an extensive surveillance for coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong and Guangdong, the province in southern China where the SARS epidemic originated, over a 2-year period. Four complete genomes of bat-CoV HKU2, three from Hong Kong and one from Guangdong, were also sequenced and analyzed. Comparison of bat-CoV HKU2 genomes with other coronavirus genomes revealed a spike protein distinct from the spike proteins of other group 1 coronaviruses, with a peptide homologous to a segment of the RBM of the S protein of SARS-CoV.",

Their genomes were 27,164-nucleotide, polyadenylated RNA, the smallest genome size among all coronaviruses with genome sequences available (Table 1\nand Fig. 2\n). The G + C content was 39% (Table 1). The four strains share the same genome structures and were highly similar in their nucleotide sequence. The three Hong Kong strains were more closely related to each other with 99.9% overall nucleotide identities, while that from Guangdong had 98.5% nucleotide identities with the three Hong Kong strains. Their genome organization was similar to other coronaviruses (Table 2\nand Fig. 2).

            "text": "The most striking feature of bat-CoV HKU2 genome was observed in its S protein which possessed the shortest amino acid sequence (1128 amino acid residues) among the S proteins of all coronaviruses, as a result of deletions in the N-terminal region (Supplementary Fig. 1). It had \u2264 27% amino acid identities to the S proteins of all known coronaviruses, as opposed to other genes which showed higher amino acid identities to the corresponding genes in other group 1 coronaviruses (especially group 1b) than to group 2 and group 3 coronaviruses (Table 1). When the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 is aligned with the S protein of other group 1 coronaviruses, many of the amino acid residues conserved among and specific to group 1b coronaviruses were not found; whereas residues conserved among all coronaviruses, especially those in the C-terminal region, were identified (Supplementary Fig. 1). In fact, the N-terminal region of the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 possessed very low amino acid identities to the corresponding regions in any group of coronaviruses, which was due to both amino acid substitutions and deletions. Despite this, a short peptide consisting of 15 amino acids (residues 314 to 328) was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV (residues 437 to 451) (Fig. 3\n). A similar peptide was also observed in bat-SARS-CoV, but not in any other known coronaviruses, suggesting that it is specific to SARS-CoV, bat-SARS-CoV and bat-CoV HKU2, with a common origin. Of the 15 amino acids within this homologous peptide, six (tyrosine 438, leucine 442, glycine 445, lysine 446, proline 449, and phenylalanine 450) were conserved between SARS-CoV and bat-CoV HKU2, with four using identical codons. Of these six amino acid residues, only four (tyrosine 438, lysine 446, proline 449, and phenylalaine) were found in bat-SARS-CoV, with two using identical codons. On the other hand, four additional amino acid residues (tyrosine 439, arginine 440, arginine 443, and leucine 447), not found in bat-CoV HKU2, were conserved between SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-CoV, though with different codon usage. In contrast to a previous study which suggested that the extended receptor-binding domain of HCoV-NL63 includes a stretch of residues with weak homology to the RBM of SARS-CoV (unpublished observations, Li et al., 2006), we and another group of researchers did not identify any significant homology between the spike protein of the two coronaviruses (Hofmann et al., 2006). When compared to the S proteins of other group 1 coronaviruses and SARS-CoV, large deletions were observed in the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 in the region corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV. Since the amino acid sequence of the S protein of bat-SARS-CoV also differed significantly from that of SARS-CoV in this region, it is likely that this is a site of frequent mutation and/or recombination among coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats. This highly variable region within the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 and bat-SARS-CoV may have been important for host receptor adaptation. Although the overall amino acid identities of the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 were equally low when compared to the S proteins of all three groups of coronaviruses, the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 shares the two conserved regions of deletions both of 14 amino acids among group 2 coronaviruses in its C-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 1). This suggests that this segment of the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 may have co-evolved with the corresponding regions in group 2 coronaviruses. Nevertheless, the receptor for bat-CoV HKU2 remains to be determined. Aminopeptidase N (CD13) has been shown to be the receptor for many group 1 coronaviruses including HCoV-229E, canine coronavirus, FIPV, PEDV, and TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992, Yeager et al., 1992). As for group 2 coronaviruses, carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) was identified as the receptor for murine hepatitis virus (MHV), while sialic acids were found to be the receptor for bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (Krempl et al., 1995, Williams et al., 1991). However, human ACE2 (hACE2) have been shown to be the receptor for both SARS-CoV, a group 2 coronavirus, and HCoV-NL63, a group 1 coronavirus, although the two viruses utilize different binding sites for receptor recognition (Hofmann et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003). The S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 does not exhibit significant homology to the known receptor binding domains of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, or MHV (Bonavia et al., 2003, Hofmann et al., 2006, Kubo et al., 1994). Further experiments are required to delineate the receptor for bat-CoV HKU2.",

BLAST search revealed no amino acid similarities between this putative nonstructural protein and other known proteins and no functional domain was identified by PFAM and InterProScan. TMHMM analysis showed two putative transmembrane domains in NS7a (residues 4\u201326 and 59\u201381). Previously, FIPV and TGEV, both group 1a coronavirus, were the only coronaviruses known to possess genes downstream of N (Fig. 1). It has been suggested that the two genes downstream of N in FIPV may be important for virulence (Haijema et al., 2004, Olsen, 1993). In TGEV, the gene downstream of N has been suggested to play a role in membrane association of replication complexes or assembly of the virus (Tung et al., 1992). In our recent report on the discovery of bat coronavirus HKU9, a novel bat coronavirus belonging to group 2d coronaviruses, two ORFs downstream to N were also found (Woo et al., 2006a). In another group 1b coronavirus recently identified from bats in China, BtCoV/512/05, an ORF downstream to N was also identified (Tang et al., 2006). These suggest that ORFs downstream to N can be present in coronaviruses other than group 1a and may be more prevalent among bat coronaviruses. Further experiments will delineate the function of such ORFs in bat coronaviruses.",

All bats infected with bat-CoV HKU2 appeared healthy. The finding that bat-CoV HKU2 can only be detected in alimentary specimens suggests that it possesses enteric tropism. The genomes of the four strains of bat-CoV HKU2 being sequenced were highly similar, with conserved nucleotide and amino acid sequences in most of their genes (Fig. 4). Traditionally, coronaviruses have been classified into groups 1, 2, and 3. Based on a comprehensive comparative analysis of the genomes of the various groups of coronaviruses, coronaviruses can be classified into group 1 (subgroups 1a and 1b), group 2 (subgroups 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d) and group 3 (Woo et al., 2006a), with SARS-CoV being classified as group 2b coronaviruses (Eickmann et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). Comparative amino acid sequence analysis showed that the predicted proteins in bat-CoV HKU2, except the S protein, were most similar to subgroup 1b of group 1 coronaviruses than to other groups of coronaviruses (Table 1). Based on phylogenetic analysis of the 3CLpro, RdRp, Hel, M, and N genes, the four strains of bat-CoV HKU2 formed a distinct branch within subgroup 1b of group 1 coronaviruses. They also possessed genomic features most similar to other members within this subgroup (Fig. 2). The genomes of group 1a coronaviruses encode two to three nonstructural proteins between S and E, whereas most group 1b coronaviruses encode only one such protein, except HCoV-229E which encodes two (Thiel et al., 2001). The genome organization of bat-CoV HKU2, most similar to Bt/CoV/512/05, a recently reported bat coronavirus from Scotophilus kuhlii in China, contains a small ORF downstream to the N gene, which is not observed in other group 1b coronaviruses. These results support that bat-CoV HKU2 represents a novel member within subgroup 1b of group 1 coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 possesses several unique features. First, it represents the shortest S protein among the S proteins of known coronaviruses, as a result of substantial deletions especially in the N-terminal region corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV. These deletions within the S protein were also largely responsible for the smallest coronavirus genome observed among all coronaviruses. Second, although comparative genome analysis strongly suggests that bat-CoV HKU2 belonged to group 1b coronaviruses, its S protein is not closely related to the S proteins of any known coronaviruses. The S proteins of coronaviruses, being responsible for receptor binding and host species adaptation, are known to be one of the most variable regions within coronavirus genomes. Nevertheless, S proteins of coronaviruses within the same group or subgroup are more closely related among themselves than to members from a different group or subgroup, as shown in the same cluster upon phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4). As demonstrated in a previous study, the within-group amino acid similarities of the S proteins of coronaviruses ranged from 59 to 91% while between-group similarities were from 22 to 36% (Tang et al., 2006). In particular, the within-group similarity of the S proteins of group 1 coronavirus was found to be 59%. In contrast, the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 possessed \u2264 27% amino acid identities to the S proteins of any known coronaviruses and formed a distinct branch away from the three groups of coronaviruses on phylogenetic analysis, suggesting that this gene had a very different phylogenetic position and hence evolutionary history as compared to other regions within the genome of bat-CoV HKU2. This virus would have either acquired this unique S protein from a yet unidentified coronavirus through recombination, or undergone rapid evolution in its S protein because of strong selective pressure. Since the Ka/Ks ratio for the S gene of bat-CoV HKU2 was found to be low when using the four strains collected from different sites and dates (Table 3), the latter hypothesis would be less supported. Moreover, further analysis revealed a unique short peptide with significant homology to a corresponding peptide within the RBM of SARS-CoV, which was not seen in any other coronaviruses except bat-SARS-CoV. The C-terminus of the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 also contained regions of deletions conserved among group 2 coronaviruses. Therefore, the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2 is likely to share a common origin with other group 2 coronaviruses, especially group 2b coronaviruses, although bat-CoV HKU2 belongs to group 1 coronaviruses. This suggests that the S of bat-CoV HKU2 could have been acquired from a group 2 or related coronavirus by recombination. Although recombination between different groups of coronaviruses has not been reported previously, targeted recombination between MHV and it has been proposed that recombination may have occurred between influenza C virus and coronavirus (Luytjes et al., 1988). Since the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), a unique protein only found in group 2 but not in group 1 or 3 coronaviruses, shared 30% amino acid homology to the hemagglutinin protein of influenza C virus, it was suggested that the HE of group 2 coronaviruses could have been acquired from influenza C virus by their ancestor through recombination. The present data suggest that the S protein of bat-CoV HKU2, bat-SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV could have originated from an unknown ancestor coronavirus and was thereafter separately evolved, with the 15-amino acid homologous region being left-in molecular signatures. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible common ancestor virus and its host species.",

            "text": "Although it remains to be determined if bats are reservoir for the direct precursor of SARS-CoV, Chinese horseshoe bats are a potential mixing vessel for the generation of new coronavirus variants. Apart from bat-CoV HKU2, bat-SARS-CoV was also found among 29 (8.3%) Chinese horseshoe bats from Hong Kong and 2 (3.1%) bats from Guangdong in the present study. Coinfection by both bat-CoV HKU2 and bat-SARS-CoV was also found in one bat from China. In our previous study, bat-CoV HKU2 was also detected in a bat positive for antibodies against bat-SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005). Recombination, a characteristic feature of coronaviruses, has been observed between both different strains of the same coronavirus species and different species of coronaviruses. Recombination between different strains of coronaviruses was first recognized in MHV, which has been utilized as a valuable molecular tool in the generation of mutants by targeted RNA recombination (Keck et al., 1988). Similar phenomenon was subsequently demonstrated in other coronaviruses such as infectious bronchitis virus, a group 3 coronavirus and between MHV and BCoV, both being group 2 coronaviruses (Kottier et al., 1995, Lavi et al., 1998). Recently, by complete genome analysis of 22 strains of CoV-HKU1, we have also documented for the first time natural recombination events in a human coronavirus giving rise to at least three different genotypes (Woo et al., 2006c). Recombination between two different species of coronavirus, feline coronavirus type I and canine coronavirus, has also been suggested to be responsible for generation of feline coronavirus type II (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Although the existing data did not provide enough evidence for recombination between bat-CoV HKU2 and bat-SARS-CoV in the generation of SARS-CoV, their co-infection of the same bat species would allow ample opportunities for recombination and emergence of other SARS-CoV-like viruses capable of inter-species transmission.",

            "text": "The role of bats in the evolution and ecology of coronaviruses is yet to be explored. The existence of coronaviruses in bats was unknown until after the SARS epidemic when we first identified a novel group 1 coronavirus and bat-SARS-CoV from bats in Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005). An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was subsequently found among the bat population in Hong Kong and other parts of China (Li et al., 2005b, Tang et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2006a, Woo et al., 2006d). Since bats are commonly found and served in wild animal markets and restaurants in Guangdong (Woo et al., 2006b), and given their species diversity, roosting behavior, and migrating ability, these animals could well be the source for emergence of zoonotic epidemics like SARS. In a previous study, it has been suggested that there was species-specific host restriction of coronavirus in bats, with most coronaviruses from a single bat species clustered together (Tang et al., 2006). However, there is evidence that one bat species can be infected by more than one coronavirus species, and more than one bat species can be infected by the same coronavirus. The consistent detection of bat-CoV-HKU2 and bat-SARS-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats over the 2-year study period from both Hong Kong and Guangdong suggested that this bat species is an established reservoir for both viruses which belonged to two different groups. Chinese horseshoe bat, under the family Rhinolophidae, is a common insectivorous species found in Hong Kong and China. Apart from Rhinolophus sinicus, R. ferrumequinum, another horseshoe bat species found in China, has also been found to harbor both group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses (Tang et al., 2006). Therefore, it is likely that bats, especially members of Rhinolophidae, can be infected by both group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses, a situation similar to humans who can be infected by group 1 (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and group 2 (SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and CoV-HKU1) coronaviruses. As for the infection of more than one bat species by the same coronavirus, SARS-CoV-like viruses have been detected in at least three different species of Rhinolophidae in China (Li et al., 2005b). More extensive surveillance for coronaviruses in different species of horseshoe bats would shed light on the role of this bat family in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses.",
