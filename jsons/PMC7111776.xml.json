Bocavirus, a genus of the Parvovirinae subfamily (Parvoviridae family), is characterized by the presence of a third major open reading frame (ORF) named NP1. The genome of bocaviruses is single-stranded (ss) DNA and approximately 5 kb in length, coding for non-structural and capsid proteins. In the past 5 years, several novel animal bocaviruses from the pig, dog, and cat, have been discovered and characterized genetically (Lau et al., 2012, Kapoor et al., 2012, Jiang et al., 2014). Therefore, a wide ranging molecular epidemiological investigation is necessary to improve understanding of bocavirus evolution.",

However, the genetic diversity of canine bocavirus (CBoV) strains circulating in China remains unclear. In the present study, the prevalence of CBoV was investigated in fecal samples from dog affected with diarrhea in Heilongjiang province, Northeast China. Furthermore, the genetic diversity and possible recombination events of the CBoV strains identified in China were analyzed. Our aim was to add basic information to increase the understanding of CBoV evolution.",

JN648103, JQ692588, JQ692589, JQ692590, JQ69259, KF771828, and KP281715).

The mixtures were amplified by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 55 \u00b0C for 1 min and 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min, in an automated thermal cycler of the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The purified products were directly subjected to sequencing by using Sanger sequencing method. Each sample was sequenced three times. Five entire VP2 sequences were submitted to the NCBI Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and their accession numbers are as follows: KT192699 for the strain MDJ-21, KT192700 for the strain MDJ-26, KT192701 for the strain DQ-beta8, KT192702 for the strain HRB-C7, and KT192703 for the strain HRB-F3.",

In the present study, investigation and phylogenetic analysis of CBoV was conducted in dogs in Heilongjiang province, Northeast China. Among all fecal samples investigated, the positive rate for CBoV was 7.5%, which is higher than previously reported (4.6%) by Lau et al. (2012). Among the three areas investigated, the positive rate for CBoV in the Mudanjiang area reached 20%, higher than the rates in Harbin (2.8%) and Daqing (15%). These data suggest that CBoV has a high prevalence in Northeast China, and that there are differences among regions. In our study, the CBoV positive fecal samples were also screened for the leading causes of canine viral enteritis, including canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine norovirus (CNoV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), and canine group A-rotavirus (CRV-A). Co-infection with CPV-2, CCoV, and CKoV was identified in the 15 CBoV positive samples; co-infection of CBoV with CPV-2 reached 40%, co-infection of CBoV with CaKV reached 26.67%, and co-infection of CBoV with CCoV reached 20%. Bodewes et al. (2014) reported a novel CBoV strain associated with severe enteritis in a litter of puppies. In our study, the high co-infection rate of CBoV with other enteric viruses suggests that CBoV, as a potential enteric pathogen, may be associated with viral diarrhea in dogs in Northeast China.",

            "text": "Recently, novel bocavirus strains have been reported in dogs and cats (Lau et al., 2012, Bodewes et al., 2014). In our study, although the 15 CBoV strains were identified in Heilongjiang province of northeast China, the identified CBoV strains exhibited differences at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels. In the phylogenetic tree based on the partial NS1 genes, the 15 CBoV strains identified from northeast China formed four different groups and one separate branch. These data demonstrated that the CBoV strains from the same area showed genetic diversity. Based on reference strains from CBoV-2, CBoV-3, and CBoV-1, the 15 CBoV strains identified in China belong to CBoV-2. The strains HRB-F3 and MDJ-17 showed a close relationship with BCoV strains from Hong Kong of China, Germany, USA, and South Korea, forming the GI group. However, the other 13 CBoV strains, forming three separate groups (GII, GIII, and GIV), and one separate branch (HRB-b2), differ genetically from the strains HRB-F3, MDJ-17, and 10 reference strains of CBoV-2, especially the GIV group. However, the NS1 genes of CBoV-2B and CBoV-2C were not available, and therefore the genotypes of the 15 CBoV strains could not be defined precisely. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis based on the VP2 gene revealed that the selected five CBoV strains were divided into different genetic groups, involving in CBoV-2HK group (the strains MDJ-26 and DQ-beta8), CBoV-2C group (the strains MDJ-21 and HRB-F3), and CBoV-2B group (the strain HRB-C7). These data demonstrated that the CBoV strains circulating in Northeast China show differential genetic evolution.",

In this study, three inter-species recombination events were identified in VP2 genes of the five selected CBoV strains which were divided into different genetic groups. Our findings are in line with a recent report that showed the presence of recombination among different regions of VP2 genes by analysis of porcine bocavirus strains in USA (Jiang et al., 2014). In our study, two potential recombinant strains HRB-F3 and MDJ-21, belonging to the CBoV-2C group, were generated by recombination of the strain DQ-beta8 (CBoV-2HK group) and the strain HRB-C7 (CBoV-2B); the potential recombinant strain MDJ-26, belonging to the CBoV-2HK group, was generated by recombination of the strain DQ-beta8 (CBoV-2HK group) and the strain MDJ-21 (CBoV-2C). The limited data suggests that the recombination events among different subgroups of the CBoV-2 strains can occur frequently. This is further supported by the extensive investigation of molecular epidemiology of CBoV strains in different districts or countries. In addition, for better monitoring recombination events, it is suggested that the co-infection of the different CBoV subgroup strains should be investigated in China in future study.",

The high co-infection of CBoV strains with CPV-2, CCoV, and CaKV were found in different proportions. The CBoV strains identified from China showed genetic diversity and potential recombination events. In future, the extensive epidemiologic surveillance and comprehensive characterization of the CBoV strains circulating in China should be done to clarify the genetic diversity of CBoVs and the association of CBoV with enteric diseases in dogs.",
