            "text": "\nThe concept of personalized medicine and the remarkable advances in lung cancer genetics and therapy in the past decade have changed lung pathology practice dramatically.The 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the lung specifies that immunohistochemistry is required for lung cancer diagnosis, not only for small biopsies and fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens but also for certain resected specimens such as solid adenocarcinoma (ADC), nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinom a, large cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and sarcomatoid carcinomas.New criteria and terminology for the diagnosis of lung cancer based on small biopsies and cytology are proposed in the 2015 WHO classification and are summarized in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.\n\nThe role of cytopathologists has expanded to not only making a specific diagnosis, including histopathological subtyping of tumors, but also to thoughtfully utilizing the limited material for necessary genetic studies to help personalize treatment strategies for advanced lung cancer patients.Thyroid transcription factor 1 ( TTF1) and napsin A are accepted markers for ADC differentiation; p40 is reported to be the most specific and sensitive marker for squamous cell differentiation. A reasonable recommendation is that, when immunohistochemistry is deemed necessary, at least one antibody each for squamous and glandular differentiation, but no more than two antibodies, should be used for an initial workup (e.g., TTF1 and p40 or p63). Thus a limited panel of TTF1 and p40 (or p63) is suggested for subtyping the tumor to preserve tissue for molecular testing.Molecular testing for epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is recommended in tumors classified as ADC and in cases where an ADC component cannot be excluded.When evaluating a computed tomography (CT)-guided FNA of a lung lesion in the periphery, mesothelial cells are frequently seen on smears; reactive mesothelial cells may mimic carcinoma, and caution should be taken.Diagnosis of ADC with a lepidic growth pattern can be challenging in FNA specimens. Both quality (degree of atypia) and quantity (groups of atypical cells) need to be considered. In a typical case of ADC with a lepidic growth pattern, the smears tend to be very cellular, containing many groups of atypical epithelial cells. In contrast, in a reactive condition, such as pulmonary infarction, atypical reactive pneumocytes are usually less numerous.In mucinous ADC with a lepidic growth pattern, the neoplastic epithelial cells may mimic pulmonary macrophages. Features such as a mucinous background, cytoplasmic mucin/vacuoles, eccentrically located nuclei, and more abundant cytoplasm are helpful in reaching a correct diagnosis.\nBasaloid squamous cell carcinoma may mimic small cell carcinoma; therefore, cellblock preparation in conjunction with immunostains will be helpful.Infection such as aspergillosis may result in squamous cells with significant cytological atypia; therefore, infectious etiologies should be excluded before a diagnosis of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma is rendered.A lesion from the mediastinum should be considered if cytological features do not fit the description of a typical \u201clung lesion.\u201dThymoma is rare in young patients and children. In lymphocyte-dominant thymoma, the main component of the aspirate may contain cortical thymocytes with expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT) and cluster of differentiation (CD)99; therefore, caution should be taken to avoid misdiagnosing it as a lymphoblastic lymphoma.Thymic neuroendocrine neoplasm may mimic an epithelial-dominant thymoma; therefore, immunohistochemistry should be performed in cases with equivocal features.\n",

SARS-CoV belongs to a family of large, positive, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The key pathologic finding is diffuse alveolar damage ( DAD) . Depending on different phases in the disease progression, the composition of inflammatory cells may vary; however, macrophages (including multinucleated forms) and lymphocytes usually predominate. Other pathologic findings, such as fibrosis, prominent vascular injury, hemophagocytosis, squamous metaplasia, apoptosis, and atypical pneumocytes, including multinucleated giant pneumocytes with irregularly distributed nuclei or pneumocytes with large atypical nuclei, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and granular amphophilic cytoplasm, were reported. Ancillary tests, such as in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, viral isolation, or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Infiltrate of TdT+ lymphocytes in >10% of the tumor area is a feature used to distinguish from type A thymoma.The tumor cells are small, oval to plump, spindled, or polygonal shaped, containing round to oval pale-staining nuclei showing dispersed chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.Medullary islands are very rare; Hassall corpuscles are absent.Summary of three distinctive features of type AB thymoma: (a) an admixed spindle cell-predominant, lymphocyte-poor component and lymphocyte-rich component; (b) bland, spindly, oval, and focally polygonal thymic epithelial cells; and (c) a focal or diffuse abundance of immature T cells\n.\n\nType B1 thymoma\n:Thymus-like architecture with predominance of cortical areas.Either absence of lobulation or lobulated with larger lobules traversed by hypocellular, collagenous septa.The neoplastic epithelial cells are individually embedded in densely packed nonneoplastic immature lymphocytes; the epithelial cells have poorly defined, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, and relatively uniform, oval to slightly irregular round nuclei, showing pale chromatin, distinct nuclear membranes, and small central nucleoli.Medullary islands are always present and may contain Hassall corpuscles and myoid cells; perivascular spaces are often seen.Summary of two distinctive features of type B1 thymoma: (a) close resemblance to the normal, non-involuted thymic cortex; (b) the consistent presence of medullary islands.Representative images are shown\nin Fig. 6.34c, d.\n\nType B2 thymoma\n:Encapsulated tumor, composed of lymphocyte- predominant, irregular size and shape tumor lobules surrounded by delicate fibrous septa, giving a lobular architecture and blue appearance on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain.Interspersed among the lymphoid cells are single or poorly defined clusters of epithelial cells (\u2265 3 cells).The epithelial cells have round or slightly oval nuclei with vesicular chromatin and small but prominent nucleoli; rare focal anaplasia may be seen.Perivascular spaces composed of a central venule surrounded by a clear space containing proteinaceous fluid or lymphocytes.Hassall corpuscles are rare; medullary islands are uncommon.Summary of distinctive features of type B2 thymoma: (a) polygonal (non-spindle shaped) neoplastic thymic epithelial cells in clusters; (b) high content of intermingled immature T cells\n.\n\nType B3 thymoma\n:Tumor lobules separated by fibrous septa, pushing borders at the invasion front, prominent perivascular spaces with epithelial palisading, rare Hassall corpuscles.Tumor cells are polygonal with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and slightly/moderately atypical, round to elongated, grooved, or raisinoid nuclei.Summary of distinctive features of type B3 thymoma: (a) predominance of polygonal epithelial cells forming solid sheets, resulting in a pink appearance on H&E; (b) paucity of admixed nonneoplastic immature T cells\n.\n\n",
