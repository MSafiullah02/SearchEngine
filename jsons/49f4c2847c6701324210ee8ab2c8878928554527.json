            "text": "Background: Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods: We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings: Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation: MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "On December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities in Wuhan announced a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, most of which included patients who reported exposure to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood wholesale market. Emergence of another pathogenic zoonotic HCoV was suspected, and on January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Diseases Control reported that a novel coronavirus was the causative agent. Shortly thereafter the genomic sequences of several isolates became publicly available. On February 10, 2020, the WHO named the disease, caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, and the new virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Genomic analyses indicated that SARS-CoV-2 shares genomic similarities with SARS-CoV within the receptor-binding motif that directly contacts the human receptor ACE2. This has important implications for vaccine design and for predicting pandemic potential. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has now been established, and the situation with SARS-CoV-2 is evolving rapidly with the numbers of verified cases growing into the thousands. Accordingly, The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.",

Cases have arisen in 27 countries globally, including a severe outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015 [3, 4] . MERS-CoV is still endemic in the Middle East, most particularly in Saudi Arabia, where more than 80% of cases have occurred. No efficacious drugs or vaccines are currently approved for human use [2, 5] .

            "text": "For both these coronaviruses, the spike (S) protein is crucial for viral transmission and infection, and determines the tropism of the virus and host cell entry. SARS-CoV-2 binds the ACE2 receptor as MERS-S binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminal surface subunit (S1), and then employs its C-terminal transmembrane subunit (S2) to fuse with the host cell membrane. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Due to this vital functional property and established antigenicity, the S protein is an important target for vaccine development. Our previous studies have shown that adenoviral vaccine candidates expressing SARS-CoV-S1 and MERS-S1 subunits induced more efficacious antibody-mediated neutralizing activity than full-length S1, suggesting the subunit immunogen as an ideal vaccine candidate [12] . The native S proteins exist as a trimeric form on the surface of the virus. However, when its ectodomain or S1 is expressed as a recombinant protein in eukaryotic systems, the protein exists predominantly in a monomeric form [13, 14] . Here, to make trimeric recombinant codon optimized subunit proteins mimicking the native viral structures, we have fused the MERS-CoV-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-S1 segments to a 27-amino acid sequence called the foldon domain, which is a natural trimerization domain derived from the C terminus of bacteriophage T4 fibritin [15, 16] . Inclusion of a foldon trimerization domain promotes a trimeric structure and has been shown to increase the immunogenicity of several viral antigens including Influenza virus hemagglutinin, HIV-1 glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV S1/S-ectodomain, supporting the importance of mimicking native viral trimeric structures [14, 17, 18] . Further, recent work has shown that a recombinant trimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV, made by fusing RBD with foldon domain (RBD-Fd), elicits potent RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies and protects hDPP4 transgenic mice from viral infection [19] . To potentially improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines, we also constructed S1 subunits with integrated Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist sequences, specifically RS09 and flagellin C. RS09 is a synthetic form of an LPS mimic 7-mer peptide, which binds to TLR4 and induces nuclear localization of the transcription factor NF-kB, resulting in transcription of inflammatory cytokines and secretion of chemokines [20] . Flagellin is a highly conserved natural bacterial ligand that binds to TLR5 to activate TLR5 expressing dendritic cells,",

Briefly, the production molds were prepared by casting Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, SYLGARD \u00d2 184) elastomer onto the micromachined MNA master molds that include 100 obelisk-shaped microneedles in a 10 \u00a3 10 array. The height, width, and apex angle of microneedles were chosen to be 750 mm, 225 mm, and 30\u00b0, respectively. Next, CMC-based MNA-rMERS-S1f, MNA-rMERS-S1fRS09, MNA-rMERS-S1ffliC, MNA-rSARS-CoV-2-S1, or MNA-rSARS-CoV-2-S1fRS09 vaccines were produced through a two-step spin-drying technique. First, 20 ml of purified protein was dispensed onto each MNA production mold and centrifuged for 1 min at 2500 g to fill the microneedle cavities. Subsequently, the excess solution was removed, and the residual protein solution was spin-dried into the tip of the microneedle cavities of the mold by centrifugation at 2500 g for 30 min. The tip-loaded protein in the production molds was overlayered with 75 mg of CMC hydrogel (20% w/w) to form the mechanically strong microneedles and the backing layer of the MNAs. The molds loaded with the CMC-hydrogel were then centrifuged for 3 h at 2500 g to obtain final dissolvable MNA vaccines. The theoretical loading of each MNA-rMERS-S1f, MNA-rMERS-S1fRS09, MNA-rMERS-S1ffliC, SARS-CoV-2-S1, or SARS-CoV-2-S1fRS09 was 25 mg, 25 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg, or 20 mg proteins, respectively. The geometric integrity of the fabricated MNAs was confirmed through optical stereomicroscopy imaging before the experiments. Importantly, this MNA design and fabrication strategy has also been used for MNAs utilized in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02192021). In line with our efforts toward clinical production of MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines, we gamma irradiation (25 kGy) sterilized a small group of these MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines to determine clinically relevant sterilizing conditions and any effect on immunogenicity.",

As shown in Fig. 2B , in the presence of MPLA adjuvant, rMERS-S1f induced a strong membrane-bound MERS-Sspecific IgG antibody response (p<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc testing), while no significant antibody response was detectable in the mouse sera of rMERS-S1f, rMERS-S1fRS09, and rMERS-S1ffliC, when compared with PBS-immunized mouse sera. On the other hand, in the absence of the adjuvant sequence, MNA intracutaneous delivery of MERS-S1f, MERS-S1fRS09, or MERS-S1ffliC, at the same molar ratio, elicited potent IgG antibody responses (p<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc testing) that were significantly stronger than those seen in s.c. immunized mice with MPLA adjuvant (p<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's posthoc testing), indicating the potential of MNAs as an effective recombinant coronavirus vaccine delivery platform. (Fig. 2B) . Mice immunized with Ad5.MERS-S1 as a positive control developed significantly higher levels of IgG antibody against cell membrane-bound MERS-S as compared to negligible IgG levels in control mice inoculated with PBS. Antibodies were not detected bound to cells transfected with pAd without the immunogen insert (data not shown). These data indicate that MERS-S1f protein with MPLA adjuvant and MNA delivered rMERS-S1f, rMERS-S1fRS09, and rMERS-S1ffliC induced strong antibody response to membrane-bound MERS-S two weeks after a single immunization.",

The size and trimerization product of the vaccine was confirmed by western blot (Fig. 5B) . The aggregation in Fig. 5B could be attributed to the trimerization of the S1's segments NTD, CTD1, and CDT2 domains or the ability of the histidine tag to oligomerize the tagged proteins [47\u00c049]. We used MNAs to vaccinate mice with SARS-CoV-2-S1 and SARS-CoV-2-S1fRS09 subunit vaccines.

            "text": "First, we describe the design and production of trimeric recombinant subunit vaccines against MERS-CoV-S1 with and without integrated immunostimulatory TLR ligand sequences. We tested the immunogenicity of these vaccine variants delivered either by traditional subcutaneous needle injection or using MNAs to more specifically target vaccine components to the immune fertile skin microenvironment. We found that MNA delivery of MERS-CoV-S1 vaccines induced stronger humoral responses than traditional needle injections regardless of the inclusion of TLR ligand binding sequences (Fig. 3A,B) . On the other hand, integration of the RS09 TLR4 binding sequence in the subunit trimer resulted in relatively stronger antibody responses than those without RS09 when vaccines were delivered by subcutaneous injection (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, the inclusion of the flagellin TLR5 binding sequence had no effect on the immunogenicity of the s.c. delivered vaccines (Fig. 3B) . Importantly, significant neutralizing activity was observed in vaccinated animals at week 6. Consistent with previous IgG results, the presence of RS09 in the subunit trimer improved the neutralization function of antibodies from s.c. immunized mice, and this was the only immunogen that resulted in significant neutralization. Notably, MNA delivery was more effective in eliciting neutralizing antibodies for all vaccines. All MNA vaccines generated higher levels of neutralizing antibody, even beyond those induced by an s.c. delivered MPLA adjuvanted vaccine, and similar to those seen following the delivery of the rMERS-S1f construct via recombinant adenoviral vector. Though levels of neutralizing antibody were elevated in mice immunized with trimers including either RS09 or flagellin, these increases were not statistically significant when compared to the MNA vaccine alone (Fig. 3C,D) . Thus, though the contributions of the integrated TLR ligands to the strong immune responses induced by MNA vaccines appear to be minimal, they provide promising benefit for s.c. vaccine administration, and their potential for contribution to immunogenicity in humans has yet to be determined. Importantly, we and others have shown effective protection against MERS-CoV challenge in hDPP4expressing mice at comparable or lower neutralizing titers in previous passive immunotherapy studies with MERS-CoV-specific antibodies or neutralizing sera obtained from MERS-CoV immune humans or animals [50\u00c053] . Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that antibodies directed against S1 domain of the spike protein, as detected in our study by ELISA, exert neutralizing activity against live coronaviruses [54] .",

            "text": "Based on our results with MERS-CoV-S1 vaccines, we focused our efforts to develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Using the described approach, within three weeks of publication of the SARS-CoV-2-spike glycoprotein sequence, we produced both rSARS-CoV-S1 and rSARS-CoV-S1fRS09 immunogens and fabricated dissolvable MNAs incorporating these vaccines in quantities sufficient for pre-clinical testing. MNA delivery of either rSARS-CoV-2-S1 or rSARS-CoV-2-S1fRS09 induced substantial and statistically significant increases in antigen-specific antibodies responses as soon as week 2 compared to pre-immunization and week 1 responses. The inclusion of RS09 did not have a significant effect on antibody titer at the 2, 3, or 4-week time points. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of MNA vaccines was maintained after gamma irradiation sterilization, suggesting a viable method to assure sterility of our MNA vaccines for clinical applications. The significant antibody titers we observed at the early time points before boosting strongly supports the feasibility of our MNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly in the context of similar results obtained with the analogous MERS-CoV-S1 constructs under the same conditions. Neutralization assays are important to ensure antibody function; however, at this early timepoint, we do not have access to validated assays for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Further, at the time of submission of this manuscript, we are just over four weeks post-immunization and based on our MERS-CoV studies, the reliable detection of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may require at least six weeks post immunization. We speculate that this delay in the neutralizing response is likely a result of the time needed for affinity maturation of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG antibodies. However, we believe that MNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will very likely induce neutralizing immunity as suggested by the vigorous early antibody responses, and commonalities between both the vaccines and the viruses. Accordingly, even though it is still early to predict whether humans immunized with these vaccine candidates will have similar responses and be protected from SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV infections, our studies demonstrate that development, production, and initial animal testing of clinically translatable MNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging infections can be rapidly accomplished. Studies directly assessing important correlates of human efficacy would provide additional support for efficacy in humans. In this regard it will be important to determine whether antibodies from MNA-SARS-CoV-2 immunized animals will neutralize virus infectivity. Further, the demonstration of protection from infection in animal challenge models, such as the hACE2 transgenic mouse model, would be informative. We plan to do these studies when these models are developed and validated. Finally, we note that the immunogenicity differences between MNA coronavirus vaccines and coronavirus vaccines delivered by traditional needle injection that we observe will need to be evaluated in clinical trials to establish the clinical advantages of MNA delivery. Microneedle array mediated immunization has several mechanistic differences from traditional intramuscular or subcutaneous needle injections, which could explain the variations in the magnitude and kinetics of the ensuing responses [55\u00c059]. The skin is immunologically reactive and contains a high density of antigen presenting and immune-accessory cells with innate immune function including keratinocytes, mast cells, and innate lymphocytes [25,60\u00c062] . Redundant skin immunoregulatory circuits can respond to a wide variety of damage or infection related signals to rapidly orchestrate an innate immune response [62\u00c064]. Further, MNAs deliver vaccine components to a defined 3D space within the skin microenvironment which results in very high vaccine concentrations with relatively low dose antigen delivery. MNA delivery of antigens to targeted skin microenvironments results in prolonged exposure of skin resident antigen presenting cells and other innate immune cells to the skin delivered components [65] . Moreover, transient mechanical stress from microneedle insertion can induce a natural local innate immune response which can serve as a physical adjuvant to enhance antigen-specific adaptive immunity [57] . MNA delivery of lower doses to a localized 3D space improves safety by reducing systemic exposure [27] . Further, MNA delivery has the potential to accelerate the process of vaccine production and to significantly reduce cost by considerably reducing the required vaccine doses [58] . The stability studies with our MNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently in progress, however; there is evidence in the literature that vaccine components including proteins are typically stabilized by integration into the MNA polymer matrix, and retain their conformational structures, as evidenced by maintenance of antibody binding function [29, 66] or retained immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus vaccines for at least a month at 25\u00b0C [67] . Thus, MNA vaccines offer the potential to eliminate the substantial costs associated with the \"cold chain\" necessary for current vaccines [34, 68] . Finally, the MNAs described here are designed to be applied without the need for an applicator or any specialized equipment, supporting the potential for self-administration. As such, these features provide several important advantages that support the future development of MNA vaccines for global protection from rapidly emerging infectious diseases.",
