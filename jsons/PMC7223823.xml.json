The impacts of a 1 \u00b0C rise have been profound, including a decrease in the number of cold days and nights, an increase in the number of warm days and nights, an increase in extreme heat events, decreased snow cover, and accelerating sea level rise. Global warming has exhibited considerable heterogeneity, with greater warming over land than over the oceans, the greatest warming occurring in the Arctic, and evidence for greater warming in winter versus summer and in nighttime versus daytime. Increased evaporation from warming has resulted in complex, region-specific changes in the hydrological cycle; while there has been an increase in overall global precipitation, some areas have become wetter and others have become drier. Both wet and dry regions, however, have experienced an increase in extreme precipitation events.",

However, there also are many non-climate drivers that determine whether a vector-borne disease is found in a particular geographic area (Table 2). For example, malaria was present in the southern United States until the 1940s, when it was eradicated by aggressive vector control measures. Thus, a suitable climate is necessary but often not sufficient, as the climate determines the potential geographic distribution of a vector-borne disease, but other factors determine the actual distribution within the boundaries set by climate.",

Nevertheless, there are serious reasons for concern. First, there have been numerous regional or local signals that climate change is affecting or will be likely to affect vector-borne disease incidence or spread. Second, one would expect a time lag between changes to the climate that make a non-endemic area suitable for endemicity, actual establishment of the vector and pathogen in that area, and occurrence and reporting of cases of disease. Third, climate change could emerge as a synergistic driver if there were backsliding on vector control measures and other public health efforts due to complacency or a lack of political will. Fourth, one would expect pathogen and vector evolution to accelerate in a warming world due to higher replication rates. Such evolution can play a significant role in vector-borne disease emergence, re-emergence and spread (for example, through pathogens evolving resistance to treatment or vectors evolving resistance to pesticides). Finally, climate change will only get worse in the foreseeable future, with models projecting a substantial expansion of regions with a suitable climate for a number of vector-borne diseases.",
