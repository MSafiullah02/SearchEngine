However, the quality of these phytochemicals is often fluctuating in the field-harvested Radix isatidis due to environmental, ecological and climatic variations. Moreover, the ever-increasing demands of herbal medicines in pharmaceutical industry together with the decreasing agricultural lands for medicinal crops worldwide, drive researchers to invest considerable efforts in the sustainable production of secondary metabolites of commercial interest by means of plant cell/organ cultures (Dias et al., 2016). In this context, we have established a reliable plant in vitro culture system, i.e. I. tinctoria hairy root cultures (ITHRCs), that could supersede the field-harvested Radix isatidis for the efficient production of bioactive flavonoids (Gai et al., 2015).",

Flavonoids always function as phytoalexins that can be inducibly synthesized in response to attacks by pathogens and insects (Fini et al., 2011). Accordingly, application of external elicitors of biological origin is likely to promote the biosynthesis of desired flavonoids in ITHRCs by inducing plant defense responses. In view of the bio-safety of products, it is recommendable to use atoxic elicitors for the improvement of flavonoid accumulation in ITHRCs.",

However, the direct utilization of live fungi as elicitors in plant in vitro cultures suffers the following disadvantages, e.g. difficulty of controlling the elicitation intensity due to the fast growth of fungi, complexity of separating fungi from cell/organ cultures, and high-cost for scale-up application. Recently, immobilization of live fungal spores by Ca-alginate gel (CAG) has opened a new avenue in biotechnological fields, which is associated with various advantages of operational simplify and stability, easy recovery, reusability, low-cost, and scale-up feasibility (Gai et al., 2017, Jin et al., 2013). Based on the foregoing, an interesting attempt in this work is to establish a co-cultivation system of ITHRCs and CAG-immobilized GRAS fungi (A. niger and A. oryzae) for elevating flavonoid production via fungal elicitation.",

However, extracts of fungal mycelia and culture filtrates are always used as biotic elicitors rather than the direct utilization of live fungus cells. Thus, the feasibility of co-culturing ITHRCs with IAN/IAO for improving flavonoid yield should be initially evaluated. As reported previously, ITHRCs initiated by culturing a high-productive hairy root line (ITHRLV) at day 24 exhibited the maximum productivity of total flavonoids (the sum amount of rutin, neohesperidin, buddleoside, liquiritigenin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol and isoliquiritigenin), independent of the elicitor used (Gai et al., 2015). Therefore, 24 day-old ITHRCs was co-cultured with IAN/IAO for 2 days under the pre-determined parameters (IAN/IAO spore concentration ca.103\n spores/mL, incubation temperature 28 \u00b0C and initial pH value of media 5.8), in an attempt to further enhance the flavonoid production in this work.",

This indicated that the immobilization matrix (CAG) did not affect the target phytochemical production in ITHRCs. As expected, the total flavonoid levels in ITHRCs challenged by IAN/IAO significantly increased relative to non-treated control, which suggested that the application of IAN and IAO treatment was indeed feasible for the augmented production of flavonoids in ITHRCs. Moreover, it is worth noting that IAN exhibited superiority in terms of flavonoid yield (1617.44 \u00b1 40.22 \u03bcg/g DW) as compared to IAO (1281.57 \u00b1 56.61 \u03bcg/g DW). This can be explained by the fact that different species of microbes have significantly different abilities to induce phytoalexins synthesis in plants. Consequently, IAN was selected as the superior elicitor for further enhancing flavonoid production in the following experiments.",

As shown in Fig. 2\nA, IAN spore concentration exhibited a dose-dependent effect on the total flavonoid yield, and the best flavonoid productivity was achieved when 104 spores/mL was used. Higher concentration of IAN spores was not evaluated in this work due to the operational difficulty. As presented in Fig. 2B, the total flavonoid yield increased with the temperature increasing from 25 to 30 \u00b0C, and kept at a stable level afterwards. In a certain range, the increase of co-cultivation temperature could enhance the metabolic activity of fungus spores thus leading to the secretion of more pathogenesis-related substances, which would strengthen the elicitation effect on ITHRCs to over-produce flavonoid for self-protection. As observed from Fig. 2C, the initial pH value of media within the range of 6.5\u20137.5 was favorable for flavonoid accumulation in the plant-fungus co-cultivation system. It is inferred that the neutral environment might be beneficial for the metabolism of fungal spores, which could contribute to the induction of flavonoid biosynthesis in IAN-treated ITHRCs. As exhibited in Fig. 2D, the total flavonoid yield in IAN-treated ITHRCs achieved its maximum level at 72 h, but was observed to decline significantly afterwards. Factually, the prolonged co-cultivation time could cause fungus spores to produce excessive pathogenesis-related metabolites, which would lead to the excessive hypersensitive responses that were characterized by the rapid metabolic damage or cell death in extreme cases (Abdin et al., 2013), thus resulting in the decreased yield of flavonoid in ITHRCs. In conclusion, the optimal co-cultivation conditions were obtained as follows: IAN spore concentration ca.104 spores/mL, temperature 30 \u00b0C, initial pH value of media 7.0 and time 72 h.",

Taken as a whole, the contents of three flavonoid glycosides (rutin, neohesperidin and buddleoside) in IAN-treated ITHRCs were significantly lower as compared to those in non-treated control, whereas the levels of five flavonoid aglycones (liquiritigenin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol and isoliquiritigenin) in IAN-treated ITHRCs were significantly higher as against those in non-treated control. It is well known that A. niger is capable of secreting extracellular \u03b2-glucosidases that can hydrolyze glucoside moieties (Cao et al., 2015). As inferred, IAN could exercise the deglycosylation function for the hydrolysis of glucoside residues in flavonoid glycosides, which might be the reason for the significant decrease of rutin, neohesperidin and buddleoside in IAN-treated ITHRCs. Additionally, the contents of flavonoid aglycones significantly increased in IAN-treated ITHRCs, which was attributed to the IAN elicitation that can promote accumulation of these phytoalexins, and was also due to the IAN deglycosylation that can bio-transform the corresponding glycoside precursors into these aglycones. Overall, the total flavonoid yield in IAN-treated ITHRCs under the aforementioned optimal conditions was 3018.31 \u00b1 48.66 \u03bcg/g DW, which remarkably increased 6.83-fold than non-treated control (441.91 \u00b1 7.35 \u03bcg/g DW).",

In most cases, an early defense event of plant cells against fungal pathogens is NO burst, which can prompt the generation of other signal molecules (SA, JA, ethylene, abscisic acid, etc.) in downstream signaling cascades (Abdin et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2005). Moreover, SA can act as an inducer of systematic acquired resistance in plant-pathogen interactions, and this function generally makes it accumulate rapidly at the infection site following fungal invasions (Zhao et al., 2005). Additionally, it is noteworthy that SA can antagonize JA biosynthesis in plant suffering from pathogen attacks (Mur et al., 2006), which can explain the phenomenon that the enhanced generation of JA occurred later than SA in this study. Overall, it could be concluded that the sequentially transient accumulation of NO, SA and JA in ITHRCs constituted an important defense line against IAN elicitation, which might contribute to gene activation involved in plant secondary metabolism for the enhanced production of phytoalexins, i.e. flavonoids in this work.",

In this work, a significant indication of oxidative stress was observed in IAN-treated root cultures with browning color as compared to non-treated control (Fig. 5\n).

Factually, O2\n\u2022\n\u2212and H2O2 are predominantly toxic intermediates originated from ROS in plant\u2013pathogen interactions (Dewanjee et al., 2014). The augmented content of H2O2 in ITHRCs during the early elicitation period provide a conclusive evidence of ROS mediated oxidative stress following IAN elicitation. Moreover, CAT activity began to increase at 24 h, reached its peak value (0.79 \u00b1 0.10 U mg/g protein) at 48 h, and maintained at a stable level afterwards (Fig. 6B). It is well known that CAT is an indispensable enzyme responsible for the dismutation of H2O2 into H2O and O2, which is considered to be the critical defense line against oxidative damages in plants suffering from environmental stresses (Gill and Tuteja, 2010). The enhancement of CAT activity accompanied by the decrease of H2O2 level in ITHRCs during the late elicitation period indicated a positive-feedback response to fight the ROS mediated oxidative stress following IAN elicitation. Overall, the actual occurrence of oxidative stress might contribute to triggering the transcription of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.",

Accordingly, control of CHI expression is a common way to effectively regulate the biosynthesis of flavonoids. It was reported that the overexpression of CHI gene in tomato resulted in the transgenic fruits containing a 78-fold increase in flavonol levels (Zhang et al., 2009). Also, co-overexpression of CHI in Del/Ros1-expressing tomato caused a 200-fold increase in flavonol contents (Lim and Li, 2017). Additionally, studies have shown that the expression of F3\u2032H is essential when kaempferol and quercetin are present in plants (Nagamatsu et al., 2007). In this study, the contents of quercetin and kaempferol in IAN-treated ITHRCs increased by 22.08-fold and 7.19- fold, respectively, which might be ascribed to the significant up-regulation of F3\u2032H expression. Overall, the significant induction of CHI and F3\u2032H transcription here suggested that the both genes might play a vital role in the elevated production of flavonoid in ITHRCs underlying IAN elicitation.",

In view of this, the reusability of IAN beads in this work was evaluated by monitoring flavonoid yield in ITHRCs during eleven successive batches. As shown in Fig. 8\nA, more than 65% of the initial flavonoid yield was still achieved in the co-cultivation system when the recovered IPC beads were reused five cycles, which suggested that IAN beads possessed the acceptable reusability as potentiality for industrial applications. Factually, the recovered IAN beads (Fig. 8C) exhibited much bigger volume and a little deeper color in comparison with the unused beads (Fig. 8B). This phenomenon was probably attributed to the inherent adsorption properties of the matrix of IAN beads. In other words, IAN beads might adsorb the colored metabolites form ITHRCs after multiple uses. This can also explain the significant decline of the reused capacity of IAN beads after 5 cycles. In this regard, the improvements in IAN reusability through other immobilization methods will be the next challenge for further reducing costs of the overall process.",

Moreover, IAN elicitation could intensify the generation of signal molecules NO, SA and JA in ITHRCs. Also, a profound effect of oxidative stress was observed within ITHRCs following IAN elicitation. These positive-feedback responses involved in plant defense regulatory systems led to the transcriptional activation of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, especially CHI and F3\u2032H, thus boosting the accumulation of the target secondary metabolites in ITHRCs. Additionally, the satisfactory reusability of IAN beads indicated that the proposed approach could offer an economic way for potentially industrial applications.
