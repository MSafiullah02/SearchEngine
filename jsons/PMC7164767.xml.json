Absorption of intact immunoglobulins begins to decline immediately after birth and ends completely by about 24 h (Stott et al., 1979). Inadequate absorption of colostral immunoglobulins, or failure of passive transfer (FPT), is common and increases morbidity and mortality risk (NAHMS, 1993). Many diseases, including Johne's, can be passed to calves via maternal colostrum (MC), and producers are advised to discard or pasteurize MC from infected cows (Stabel, 2001). This practice can reduce the supply of available MC and may force producers to use colostrum containing less IgG.",

            "text": "Colostrum supplement products, which typically contain 25 to 45 g/L IgG, can be added to MC to increase IgG mass (Davenport et al., 2000). Supplements made from dried colostrum (Zaremba et al., 1993) or dried whey (Garry et al., 1996; Mee et al., 1996) did not improve absorption of IgG over MC. Supplements based on purified blood proteins have improved IgG absorption in some reports (Todd et al., 1993; Arthington et al., 2000b), but not in other reports (Arthington et al., 2000a; Quigley et al., 2000a). Supplementation does not eliminate MC as a disease transmission vehicle; however, replacement of MC may be able to prevent disease. Quigley et al. (1998b, 2002) reported colostrum replacer (CR) products provided adequate IgG to calves. Any CR must contain sufficient absorbable IgG to effectively mimic colostrum in establishing passive immunity. Although immunoglobulins contained in CR may not provide protection to farm-specific pathogens, CR have potential advantages in consistent composition and quality. An effective CR would provide a viable alternative for producers facing limited or contaminated colostrum supplies.",

Differences in IgG concentrations between calves fed plasma in CMR and calves fed control CMR were not detected. To estimate clearance rate, change in IgG from day \u00d7 to day y was divided by IgG on d x (e.g., [(d 1 \u2212 d 8)/d 1] \u00d7 100). Apparent clearance rates were calculated for each 7-d period (Figure 2\n). Calves fed MC had an apparent clearance rate of 3.5% per day in wk 1, which agrees well with estimates determined by clearance of 125I-labeled IgG1 (Besser et al., 1988). Rate of clearance in wk 2 (1.98%) was also similar to calculations of Besser et al. (1988). Based on these estimates, calves either cleared less IgG or produced more IgG as age increased. Since endogenous IgG production can begin at 3 d (Devery et al., 1979), it is likely that endogenous production increased with age, resulting in an apparent decrease in clearance rate in wk 3 and a gain in IgG over wk 4.",

Ratio of IgG1 to IgG2 in serum is approximately 1:1 (Mayer et al., 2002), but in colostrum it is skewed toward IgG1 at 95:5 (Butler, 1983). In calves fed serum-derived CR, half of the passively acquired IgG was likely IgG2, and clearance of IgG acquired from CR may follow a different pattern. Calves fed CR appeared to clear IgG less rapidly. This may be explained by Mayer et al. (2002), who found that the Fc receptor in the neonate is specific for IgG1 and is responsible for resecretion of circulating IgG back into the lumen of the intestine. It would follow that if there were more IgG1 in the blood of calves receiving MC it would be cleared from the blood more rapidly, resulting in lower IgG levels in the calf with increasing age. Alternatively, increased endogenous IgG production may have occurred. Previous work has shown that hypogammaglobulinemic calves begin synthesizing IgG earlier than calves with adequate IgG (Logan et al., 1974).",

However, when gains were analyzed by week, calves fed MC were more feed efficient only in wk 1 (Figure 3\n). Holsteins converted feed into BW gain more efficiently than Jerseys (0.391 \u00b1 0.081 compared with 0.244 \u00b1 0.084 kg of gain/kg of DMI). Observed feed efficiencies fall within the range of values (0.330 to 0.680 kg of gain/kg of DMI) reported by other researchers (Lammers et al., 1998; Quigley et al., 2000b).",

Calves fed CR received a greater volume of liquid in the first 24 h and probably receive less protein than calves fed MC. Colostrum was not analyzed for protein, but contains about 15% protein (Foley and Otterby, 1978) as compared with the CR used in this study, which contained about 10% protein. Calves fed CR appeared to experience a greater increase in plasma volume as evidenced by reduced packed cell volume from d 0 to 1 than MC-fed calves; packed cell volume decreased by 4.39 \u00b1 0.75 and 2.63 \u00b1 0.76 percentage points from d 0 to 1 for CR and MC-fed calves, respectively.

Jersey calves had greater total plasma protein than Holstein calves on d 1, 8, and 22, which could also occur due to lower plasma volume.

Apparent clearance rate of passively acquired IgG was faster in calves fed MC than in calves fed CR. Calves fed MC had greater feed efficiency than calves fed CR. No other differences in growth or health performance were attributable to source of IgG in the first 24 h. However, while CR may provide adequate amounts of IgG, the viability and specificity of antibodies, as well as the ratio of IgG1 to IgG2, are potential concerns for the efficacy of these products. If IgG molecules are not viable and specific for pathogens in the local environment, then amount provided is irrelevant. Effects of intense processing required to isolate and concentrate IgG from animal proteins on activity of IgG also need to be determined. Furthermore, the ratio of IgG1 to IgG2 in colostrum is likely skewed in favor of IgG1 for a physiological reason. The impact of changing this ratio needs to be evaluated more closely. If calves receiving CR are stimulated to produce IgG1, then the product could be very valuable in providing enough initial IgG1 to effectively protect the calf until endogenous production begins. At the same time, IgG2 would be present in excess of normal concentrations and may offer additional benefits. On the other hand, increased concentrations of IgG2 may inhibit IgG1 production and lead to reduced immunity as IgG is cleared from the blood. However, since no differences were observed in morbidity or mortality in this trial, it may be assumed that CR offered equivalent protection as MC under the conditions of this study.",
