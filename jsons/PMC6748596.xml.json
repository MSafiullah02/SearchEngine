            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder which is characterized by hyperglycemia along with alterations in carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism associated with complete or relative deficiencies in insulin secretion and/or insulin action [1]. Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes is associated with long term damage, dysfunction and eventually the failure of organs, particularly the eyes, kidneys, nerves and cardiovascular system [2]. In addition to hyperglycemia, several other factors such as dyslipidemia or hyperlipidemia are also involved in the development of cardiovascular complications in diabetes which are the major causes of morbidity and mortality [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 220 million people worldwide have diabetes and this number would be likely to more than double by the year 2030 [4]. The management of diabetes with insulin and synthetic oral hypoglycemic drugs can produce serious side effects and in addition, they fail to prevent diabetes related complications in many patients. Therefore, new diabetic management strategy is obligatory nowadays which should be more effective and have less side effects than the synthetic drugs [5]. Many species of plants and plant based drugs have been described in the scientific literature as having hypoglycemic activity due to their apparent effectiveness and minimal side effects in clinical experience and relatively low costs [6].",

Insulin insufficiency causes elevation in the levels of blood glucose as a result of excessive production of endogenous glucose by hepatic as well as extrahepatic tissues through gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways and reduced consumption of glucose through glycolytic, TCA cycle, glycogenic and HMP pathways by various tissues during diabetes mellitus [41].",

Diabetic rats showed higher levels of glycosylated hemoglobin indicating their poor glycemic control. Treatment of theaflavin and metformin to diabetic rats significantly reduced the HbA1c levels compared to untreated diabetic rats.

Upon treatment with theaflavin and metformin to high fat diet and streptozotocin \u2013 induced rats resulted in a notable reversal in the activity of hexokinase.

Studies have shown that during diabetes, the activity of Lactate dehydrogenase increase due to impairment in insulin secretion [58]. Our results are agreement with these studies. Thus, increased activity of LDH interferes with normal glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in the \u03b2 cells of pancreas and it may therefore be directly responsible for insulin secretory defects in diabetes due to the high fat diet and streptozotocin induced oxidative stress mediated cellular damage. Besides, the elevated levels of LDH in hepatic and renal tissue indicate the cell damage. Upon treatment with theaflavin and metformin to diabetic rats restored the LDH activity by regulating the NADP/NADH ratio thereby stimulating the oxidation of NADH. Normal LDH activity is indicative of improved channeling of (pyruvate) glucose for mitochondrial oxidation.",

The reduction in the activities of gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic enzymes in hepatic and renal tissues of diabetic rats treated with the drug suggest that the drug has ameliorated the alterations in carbohydrate metabolism by preventing the endogenous glucose production through these two pathways.
