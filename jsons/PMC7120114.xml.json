They thus cause a considerable financial burden on the health-care system throughout the world. The elderly and immunocompromised subjects with medical conditions are especially at high risk of developing severe course of infection and various complications. The most common respiratory viruses are influenza virus type A (IV-A) and B (IV-B), respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV-A) and B (RSV-B), parainfluenza virus type 1, 2 and 3 (PIV-1, -2, -3), human rhinoviruses (hRV), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV), adenoviruses (AdV), human coronaviruses (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV) and enteroviruses (EV) (Do et al. 2011).",

This makes the clinical distinction between different agents involved in infection very difficult. Although the high rates of infection with more than one respiratory virus have been reported, especially in children (Table 36.3), the real number of co-infections is undoubtedly underestimated, mainly due to sensitivity of diagnostic methods used and limited number of tested viruses. In majority of cases the most likely or casual viral agents are tested first and the diagnostics stops with a detection of the primary relevant infectious agent. Meanwhile rapid, reliable, and accurate identification of every viral pathogen involved in infection is crucial for patient management, surveillance, and control of infection, including the prevention of nosocomial transmission.",

While single PCR assay enables a detection of only one target, the multiplex molecular methods provide a simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in the single reaction and thus give a more accurate diagnosis of causative pathogens and provide a better understanding of the etiology of infection. The main advantages of using multiplex reactions are time saving and reducing the use of reagents and specimens, and consequently the cost of analysis. The Seeplex RV Detection Kit (Seegene Inc., Korea), used in our study, is a qualitative multiplex assay that detects 12 respiratory viruses including 11 types of RNA and one type of DNA virus: IV-A, IV-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, hRV, hMPV, Adv, hCoV OC43 and combined hCoV 229E/NL63. The assay uses dual priming oligonucleotide (DPOTM) technology, which prevents non-specific amplification (it generates consistently high specificity by blocking the extension of non-specifically primed templates). The primers were designed for highly conserved regions in viral genome.",

In the majority of these specimens, hospitals required only detection of influenza viruses (IV-A and IV-B (n  =  29) or IV-A and subtype A(H1N1)2009 (n  =  93)). Testing of specimens not only for influenza, but also other respiratory viruses was commissioned only for 18 patients.

            "text": "Conventional methods of diagnostics of viral respiratory infections base mainly on virus isolation by cell culture, antigen detection, and serological assays. Cell culture has been considered as the gold standard for virus diagnosis but is not adapted to all medically important respiratory viruses. In contrast to this method, PCR permits rapid detection of viruses that are difficult to culture or have not been well replicated in vitro, such as hMPV, hCoV NL63 and hRV, with excellent sensitivity and specify (Calvo et al. 2008). Additionally, viruses present in specimens may considerably differ with viral loads and rate of replication, and this would make the detection of slowly replicating pathogens difficult. Therefore, numerous studies have been developed over recent years to evaluate the PCR-based methods for detection and typing/subtyping of respiratory viruses (Templeton et al. 2004; Bellau-Pujol et al. 2005; Gunson et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2008). When a viral infection is taken into consideration, because of very similar and nonspecific clinical symptoms caused by various respiratory viruses, the list of possible etiologic agents is very long. In contrast to monoplex PCR reaction, the use of multiplex PCR allows detecting various respiratory pathogens in a single reaction, including the identification of the type and the detection of co-infections with multiple agents, which could be missed by the monoplex reaction. The introduction of multiplex PCR to routine diagnostics revealed a higher prevalence of co-infections than has previously been reported by conventional techniques (Freymuth et al. 1997). A review of the literature indicates that the rate of co-infections may range from approximately 15 to as high as 50% of all positive specimens (Table 36.3). The majority of papers presenting the results of molecular assays for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses and mixed infections focus on pediatric patients, infants, and young children in whom viral shedding in the respiratory tract is usually much higher. In these patients, the respiratory syncytial viruses were the most common pathogen occurred in respiratory viral co-infection, the next most often identified viruses in mixed infection were hRV, PIV, hMPV, and others. There also are observed co-infections with different subtypes of influenza A virus (Pajak et al. 2011).\n",

This may support the physician\u2019s decision regarding the selection of appropriate treatment and a prompt use of antiviral drugs, such as neuraminidase inhibitors in case of influenza infections, for a patient, the exposed family members, or contact persons. Clinicians are inclined to use antibiotics in cases when the etiological agent of infection is not identified. Therefore, in spite of lack of specific antiviral drugs and the symptomatic and supportive treatment in majority of respiratory viral infections, a rapid detection of viral pathogen may help avoid an inappropriate use of antibiotics. Moreover, the multiplex methods that enable detection of a broad spectrum of common viral pathogens are clinically desirable in case of specific groups of patients: children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals who tend to have prolonged virus shedding and who are at increased risk of serious complications and mortality. Such tests allow detecting agents not primarily expected in a patient.",

In numerous studies that have described co-infections, no clinical differences among patients with single and multiple infections are reported, including the severity of disease, clinical signs of infection, their intensity, or duration of hospital stays (Brouard et al. 2000; Lee et al. 2010; Nascimento et al. 2010). In contrast, Calvo et al. (2008) reported that infants with co-infections of RSV and one or more other respiratory pathogens have a significantly higher incidence of fever and the duration of hospitalization was longer in comparison to infants infected only with RSV. In the study of Richard et al. (2008), a significant correlation between dual viral infection and increased severity in bronchiolitis was found and infants with co-infections were at 2.7 times higher risk for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit than those with single infections. The other significant factors that bore on the severity of infection were: age (<42 days), premature birth, and the underlying chronic disease. There were no statistically significant differences between host conditions, duration of assisted ventilation or of supplemental oxygen administration, and duration of hospitalization (Richard et al. 2008). Certainly, further studies for a better understanding of these various interactions and the clinical differences between single and multiple respiratory viral infections need to be carried out.",

Such interactions have been observed for the following viruses: RSV and IV; RSV-A and RSV-B; RSV and PIV; hRV and RSV/IV. However, in the present study we identified four cases of simultaneous infections with RSV and IV. Two of these cases were caused by RSV-A and RSV-B and one by both types of RSV and PIV. These four co-infected patients (P1, P2, P3 and P4) were hospitalized in the same unit, multiple infections were caused by four different combinations of only six viruses (IV-A in four patients, IV-B in two patients, RSV-A in four patients, RSV-B in three patients, hCoV OC43 in two patients, and PIV-3 in one patient) and all specimens were collected during 1 week, which all suggests a high probability of nosocomial transmissions. Additionally, in the case of Patient 2, the second specimen collected after an interval of 19 days was negative for IV-A and RSV-A but positive for RSV-B.",

In electrophoretic gel patterns of PCR products obtained for patients with co-infections, the intensity of bands was variable, with some faint bands. Due to excellent sensitivity of PCR and its very low detection limit (even several copies per reaction, including non-replicated viruses), weak positive results may be related not with active but passing infection (Calvo et al. 2008). Especially in children and immunosuppressed patients, shedding of a low concentration of viruses from a previous infection would be expected. This may be relevant for the interpretation of multiple infections and for the role of particular pathogens in the clinical picture of disease. The identified presence of viral agents does not exclude the possibility of concomitant infection caused by bacterial pathogens. In our study, in Patients 2, 3, and 4 cultures of bronchial secretion or sputum gave all negative results. In Patient 1, culture of bronchial secretion was positive for Acinetobacter baumanii and in Patient 5 it was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae but that from a throat swab was negative.",
