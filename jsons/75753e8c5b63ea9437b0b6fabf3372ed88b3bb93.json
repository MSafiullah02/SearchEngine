            "text": "Uncertainty around the role 'super-spreaders' play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition. It is a term that has been much used in relation to COVID-19, particularly in social media. On its widest definition, it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people. Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others. Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings. This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic. One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged superspreaders. Another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition.",

The R0 is a measure of potential transmissibility that is difficult to establish, particularly if the accuracy of the data is questionable as where, for example, there is under-or mis-reporting. Underlying the R0 is a considerable variation which, early in the outbreak, Mackenzie (2020) postulated may be down to the role of super-spreaders: around 10% of cases could be responsible for up to 80% of transmission.

Some individuals are asymptomatic throughout, though the risk of transmission is probably somewhat lower in such cases.

Stein (2011) observes that observational and modelling studies support a 20/80 rule whereby 20% of individuals are likely to contribute around 80% of the transmission potential in a given infectious disease.

Spreading can be exacerbated by poor hygiene or certain social practices such as hand shaking, but infection of others is not evidence alone that guidelines on behaviour have been ignored.

If any potential biological super-spreading tendencies of COVID-19 were better understood, then it could aid management and control through, for example, isolation or targeted vaccination if and when it becomes available. Research might usefully focus on the tendency of some individuals to shed high levels of the pathogen, including investigation of co-morbidity, genetics, viral load and infectivity at different stages of presentation. In COVID-19, the relationship between viral load, severity and infectivity is complex and poorly understood. Increased viral load does not necessarily result in more severe symptoms (Geddes 2020) , and infection dose is currently uncertain.

Pre- COVID-19, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) argued that control measures for infectious disease that focus on individual-specific measures can outperform population-based measures. They proposed a rigorous protocol for defining super-spreading events that would supplement the R0 with information about factors such as distribution and range. Research bringing greater clarity as to the factors that drive variations in infectivity would contribute to targeted control policies that could reduce reliance on widespread lockdown. However, such research is likely to be reliant upon the public giving up their confidential data or at least cooperating if such data are mandated. Technology offers a potential to track, predict, trace contacts and respond in a more precise manner. There are, for example, several apps in development/use. Some allow users to report symptoms so that more can be learned about how the virus behaves, some give people advice on the basis of reported symptoms and some operate in conjunction with testing to alert individuals with whom an infected person has come into contact, to isolate. These apps offer potential to learn more about heterogeneity and also to implement more targeted control measures in response. In many countries, efficacy will be reliant on the willingness of individuals to sign up to the apps. Those individuals will need assurance that their privacy will be respected and that negative implications will not flow from their identification as a perceived 'super-spreader'.",

Regulation 3(4) allows the Secretary of State, having had independent advice from the Confidentiality Advisory Group, to give notice to health organisations, general practices and local authorities that confidential information will be required (DHSC 2020) for a certain purpose. The purpose in this case is COVID-19 and includes understanding risks and trends including (amongst other things):",

(DHSC 2020, 2) This widely framed notice mandates the processing and sharing of confidential information, in circumstances where patients have not given informed consent. Together with the proposals to share information with private companies for the production of the Dashboard, it is a high-risk strategy that will have profound implications if public trust is undermined. Whilst efforts will be made to protect the identity of the patients, anonymity is not a binary concept and, as argued above in relation to the Brighton case, media interest in 'super-spreaders' could lead to 'jigsaw identifiability' and to moral blame, which in turn could impact on trust.",

Consideration of the tendencies of individuals to exacerbate infection rates is a worthy focus of research. As more targeted public health responses are developed to replace widespread physical distancing policies, it is increasingly important that heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission is explored and factored into responses. To the extent that super-spreading is an aspect of research on heterogeneity, there is a risk that the negative connotations the term has attracted will result in public reticence to give up the private information upon which that research might depend. Greater accuracy of definition would help ensure that debate around the term is not at cross-purposes, help reduce or prevent moral blame of those who unwittingly infect others and could enhance public trust around the use of confidential data.",

Turning briefly to potential solutions, one option would be to avoid use of the term altogether, but it is well accepted in the scientific literature (see for example Lloyd-Smith 2005 , Stein 2011 , Gopinath 2014 , and its abandonment could disrupt important linkage between current and previous research. Another option would be to encourage the use of the terms 'super-spreading' and 'super-spreading events' in epidemiology, in place of 'super-spreader'. This might reduce stigma, but it is unlikely to limit more general (mis)application of the term. Another option would be to encourage the development of a clearer taxonomy of super-spreading so as to take scientific ownership of the term and discourage inappropriate lay adoption, potentially through a classification of behavioural, environmental and biological superspreading. appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
