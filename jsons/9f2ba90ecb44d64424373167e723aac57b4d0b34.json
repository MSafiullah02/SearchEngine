A patient who is registered on the waiting list for heart and/or lung transplantation has been chronically ill for months and even years. Patients waiting for a heart have circulatory and respiratory problems, multiple organ dysfunction and often show signs of immunodepres-sion. Lung transplant patients usually have a long history of cystic fibrosis with all its known associated infections, or have suffered from chronic bronchitis, emphysema or idiopathic fibrosis, which result in hypoxia and hyperglobulinaemia. All such patients have been under close medical care and observation. Their underlying disease was known and was heavily and specifically treated.",

They often receive large numbers of blood PCT allows an early differential diagnosis between rejection (AR) and bacterial/fungal infection (IF) and thus a rapid and focused therapeutic intervention. It avoids unnecessary antibiotic treatment which could be toxic for the graft itself in patients with rejection only. PCT provides vital information early to clinicians and allows them to improve the management of bacterial/fungal infections in immunocompromized transplant patients. PCT thus facilitates and improves the outcome of survival rate and the quality of life in the postoperative period of patients with heart and/or lung grafts.",

This treatment is strongest within the first seven days, but remains relatively high for another month. The steroids are usually tapered off as are other potent immunosuppressive drugs like Azathioprin, Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus. A rejection episode, which occurs in more than 60 % of all transplant patients, needs an immediate boost of immunosuppression. Under this beneficial anti-rejection treatment patients have a significant risk for opportunistic infections. According to the European Transplant Registry more than 50 % of transplanted patients were found to have infections in the first post operative year, 40 % of which were of viral, 42 % of bacterial, 10 % of fungal and 8 % of protozoal origin. Their early and rapid detection is necessary for prevention measures and could improve the survival outcome of the transplant patient. It would facilitate post transplant monitoring and minimize unnecessary treatment of non-infected patients. This would be of vital advantage, because antibiotic treatment often has toxic side effects not only to the graft but also to the patient.",

However, it increases in both, viral and bacterial infections [21] and may decrease despite persistency of bacteria in septic patients [18] .
