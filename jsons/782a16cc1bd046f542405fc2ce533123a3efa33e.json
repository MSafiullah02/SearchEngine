Methods and Results: Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the N-terminal half of spike protein (S1 protein) of TGEV were identified. Affinity constant of these mAbs was analysed. These mAbs were capable of reacting with the TGEV S1 protein analysed by ELISA and Western blot. A competition assay between the different mAbs was performed to determine whether the different antibodies mapped in the same or a different antigenic region of the protein.",

Conclusions: The generated four mAbs are very specific, and the established immunofluorescence assays, Western blot and discrimination ELISA are useful approaches for detecting of TGEV. Significance and Impact of the Study: It is a novel report regarding the use of the S1 protein of TGEV to generate specific mAbs.

            "text": "TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome and belongs to the family Coronaviridae. The viral particle of TGEV is composed of four identified structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M), the minor envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) (Spaan et al. 1988; Ren et al. 2008) . TGEV S protein is a major viral antigen and can elicit the neutralizing antibodies in hosts (Jim\u00e9nez et al. 1986 ). The interaction between the S protein and porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), the cellular receptor of TGEV, mediates the virus entry and subsequent membrane fusion (Delmas et al. 1992; Liu et al. 2009 ). Consequently, the S protein of TGEV can be selected as a candidate for antigen detection and vaccine design. Four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) located on the amino-terminal half of protein S have been identified (Delmas et al. 1990) . In this study, using the bacterially expressed TGEV S1 protein and hybridoma technique, four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the S1 protein were generated and characterized. The availability and utility of these mAbs are helpful for detecting and analysing TGEV infection.",

The PCR product purified with a DNA purification kit (KeyGen, Nanjing, China) was cloned into BamH I and EcoR I sites of a prokaryotic expression vector, pGEX-6P-1.

The aim of this study is to identify and characterize mAbs against the S protein for virus surveillance and function analysis. TGEV S gene encoding the S protein is c. 4300 bp in length, and four major antigenic sites are located in the N-terminal half of the S protein (Del-mas et al. 1990 ). Therefore, the N-terminal half of the S gene (S1 gene) was expressed in the E. coli system because this system has advantages consisting of low cost, convenience and high fermentation potential (Yin et al. 2007 ). Many heterologous proteins have been expressed in this system (Ren et al. 2010a,b,c) . In this study, the S1 protein of TGEV was expressed in the same system and used to immunize BALB \u2044 c mice. Using conventional hybridoma techniques, four positive mAbs against the S1 protein of TGEV were generated, and the isotype of 3G2 is IgG3. And the isotypes of other mAbs identified in this study are IgG1. The data indicate that this protein can induce the generation IgG antibody in the immunized mice.",
