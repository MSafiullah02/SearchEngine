An arginine-rich motif of P7a N-terminus was found to determine nuclear and nucleolar localization. Amino acids substitution or deletion of the R-rich motif interfered with P7a nuclear and nucleolar localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed that P7a protein interacted with Nicotiana benthamiana nuclear import factor importin \u2423, suggesting that P7a is translocated into the nucleus by the classical importin \u2423/\u2424-dependent pathway. Moreover, P7a also interacted with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin. Mutations in the R-rich motif of P7a diminished P7a interactions with importin \u2423 and fibrillarin, influenced viral replication in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts and altered the symptom phenotype and viral RNA accumulation in Chenopodium amaranticolor plants.

Although the nuclear pore complexes allow small spontaneous proteins(<60 kD) to enter the nuclear, many proteins contain nuclear localization signals (NLS) to facilitate their transport (Kosugi et al., 2009; Krichevsky et al., 2006; Lange et al., 2007) . Classical NLS have either one (monopartite) or two (bipartite) basic amino acid motifs composed of arginines and lysines (Lange et al., 2007) . A monopartite NLS, as exemplified by the SV40 large T antigen NLS, is composed of at least four consecutive basic amino acids (PKKKRRV) (Kalderon et al., 1984) ; whereas bipartite NLS signals, similar to the nucleoplasm protein NLS (KRPAATKKAGQAKKK), contain two basic amino acid clusters separated by a 10-12 amino acid spacer (Robbins et al., 1991) . The nucleocytoplasmic transport model is best understood as the nuclear importin \u2423/\u2424 pathway (Lange et al., 2007; Truant and Cullen, 1999) . During import via the importin \u2423/\u2424 pathway, the importin \u2423 protein binds to cytoplasmic proteins that contain NLS, and couples the proteins to importin \u2424 proteins (Adam and Geracet, 1991; Kosugi et al., 2009; Weis et al., 1996) . Importin \u2424 next docks the trimeric cargo-import-\u2423/\u2424 complex to the NPC and then releases the cargo into the nucleus via binding of Ran-GTP (Lange et al., 2007; Pemberton and Paschal, 2005; Weis, 2003) . Some viral proteins that contain a classical NLS were defined to follow this nuclear import pathway and interact first with importin \u2423 (Greber and Fassati, 2003; Guerra-Peraza et al., 2005; Truant and Cullen, 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 138, "text": "(Cronshaw et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 139, "end": 163, "text": "Krichevsky et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 352, "end": 373, "text": "(Kosugi et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 374, "end": 398, "text": "Krichevsky et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 399, "end": 418, "text": "Lange et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 542, "end": 562, "text": "(Lange et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 701, "end": 724, "text": "(Kalderon et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 893, "end": 915, "text": "(Robbins et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1031, "text": "(Lange et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1056, "text": "Truant and Cullen, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1246, "text": "(Adam and Geracet, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1267, "text": "Kosugi et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1286, "text": "Weis et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1448, "text": "(Lange et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1477, "text": "Pemberton and Paschal, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1489, "text": "Weis, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1653, "text": "(Greber and Fassati, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1681, "text": "Guerra-Peraza et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1706, "text": "Truant and Cullen, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Some available reports suggest that the nuclear proteins encoded by the plant RNA virus which replicate in cytoplasm interact with the nuclear elements or suppress host defense.

Therefore, we used the fibrillarin protein, which localizes in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies (CBs) as a sub-nuclear marker to provide more precise evaluation of P7a localization. The fibrillarin (Fib) gene was cloned from N. benthamiana, fused to the C-terminus of GFP to produce pGDG-Fib, and then co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaves with the P7a vectors, pGDR-GUS-P7a, pGDR-GUS-P7a R5A , pGDR-GUS-P7a R9A,R10A , or pGDR-GUS-P7a R21A,K22A . The intense red fluorescence from pGDR-GUS-P7a was visible as large nuclear bodies and as smaller intense foci that co-localized with the green fluorescence from pGDG-Fib. The latter result suggested that P7a was concentrated in the nucleolus and possibly in the CBs (Fig. 5A) . The P7a mutant fusion protein, RFP-GUS-P7a R5A , also accumulated in the nucleolar (Fig. 5B ). However the RFP-GUS-P7a R9A,R10A mutant failed to localize to the nucleolus (Fig. 5C ), whereas the separate mutant RFP-GUS-P7a R21A,K22A was similar to P7a in nucleolar targeting (Fig. 5D ).

Interestingly, when a single nucleus contained two nucleoli, the P7a fluorescence was always confined to one nucleolus (Fig. 5E) , so it is possible that nucleolar localization functions may target P7a accumulation to specific nucleolar addresses during the early phases of foci formation.

In another report of Turnip crinkle virus, the cell-to-cell movement P8 protein was localized on the nucleus, suggesting a function in the cell nucleus (Cohen et al., 2000) . However, P7a is the first cell-to-cell protein encoded by the Necrovirus genus (Lommel et al., 2005) that has been shown to localize in the nuclear. In this study, we further used the BiFC assays to confirm that P7a is targeted to the nucleus also via the importin \u2423 pathway, the classical import pathway in eukaryotic cells (Lange et al., 2007) . Deletion of the R-rich motif abolished P7a associations with importin \u2423, underlying the important role of this region in establishing the interaction. We also found the direct correlation between the nuclear localization of RFP-GUS fusions P7a mutants and interaction of the corresponding P7a versions with the importin \u2423. Many plant virus nuclear proteins always interact with importin \u2423, such as the P25 protein which is encoded by BNYVV, and the CP protein of RTBV (Guerra-Peraza et al., 2005; Vetter et al., 2004) .
