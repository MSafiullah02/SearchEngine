            "text": "A prospective 2-year analysis including 322 infant patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) hospitalized in a pediatric department in northern Italy was carried out to evaluate the role as respiratory pathogens or co-pathogens of recently identified viruses. The presence of respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), human Metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), human Bocaviruses (hBoVs), and human Coronaviruses (hCoVs) was assayed by molecular detection and clinical symptoms evaluated. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen. Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV-OC43, 35.7% hCoV-NL63, 21.4% hCoV-HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV-229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed, 50% subtype 1 and 50% subtype 2); 21/150 samples revealed the presence of 2 or more viruses. Co-infection rates were higher for hMPVs, hCoVs, and hBoV (38.3%, 46.4%, and 57.1%,) and lower for RSV (23.3%). RSV was associated with the presence of complications (P < 0.001) and hypoxia (P < 0.015). When the presence of RSV alone and the RSV-hMPV coinfections were considered, RSV mono-infected patients resulted to have longer hospitalization and higher hypoxia (P < 0.001). The data highlight that (i) RSV has a central role as a respiratory pathogen of infants, (ii) the wide circulation of recently identified viruses does not reduce the clinical and epidemiological importance of RSV, and that (iii) recently identified agents (hMPVs, hBoVs, and hCoVs) act as primary pathogens or co-pathogens.",

            "text": "Viral agents are a worldwide leading cause of respiratory diseases in infants with high morbidity and mortality. From 45% to 60% of all acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) in infants and young children are associated with infections by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses [Kuiken et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2006; Medici et al., 2006 ]. In addition, other viruses are presently emerging or have been identified recently as important respiratory pathogens. Firstly, a novel paramyxovirus, named human metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been isolated and characterized; it is presently believed that hMPV infects children and adults, accounting for 5-10% of all ARDs [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] . Secondly, novel pathogens belonging to the family Coronaviridae have then been isolated in respiratory samples of patients with ARD [Pyrc et al., 2007] ; even if the previously identified human coronaviruses (hCoV) OC43 and 229E were mainly associated with mild upper ARDs in adults, and only rarely with infections with severe symptoms in children [Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965; Hamre and Procknow, 1966] , particular attention was directed toward this group of viruses after the SARS-CoV epidemics. These studies led to the discovery of novel hCoV strains, namely hCoV-NL63, which was identified in a child with bronchiolitis in 2004 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] , and hCoV-HKU1, that was discovered in an adult patient with chronic pulmonary disease in 2005 [Woo et al., 2005] . After identification, these pathogens were found in respiratory samples in many countries [Pyrc et al., 2007] . Thirdly, a novel human parvovirus was identified in clinical specimens from infants with ARDs and designated human bocavirus (hBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] ; hBoV is being detected worldwide in samples from children with a wide range of respiratory diseases, from upper ARDs to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia Arnold et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2007; Pierangeli et al., 2007] .",

            "text": "All samples were split into two aliquots (200 ml each) and frozen at \u00c080% if nucleic acids were not immediately extracted. Only one aliquot per patient was used to perform all the analyses. Viral genomes were extracted from 200 ml of sample by using Qiagen Mini extraction kits and eluted in 60 ml of EB buffer following manufacturer' instructions. All extracts were subjected to the following diagnostic panel, including RSV RNA, hMPV RNA, hCoV RNA (by family-specific RT-PCR protocols), and hBoV DNA. For hCoV, hMPV, and RSV detection, 10 ml of extract for each pathogen were previously reverse transcribed, by using random hexamers and MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a 20 ml reaction mixture. After reverse transcription (RT), family-or strainspecific PCR protocols were performed (Table I) by combining 10 ml of RT reaction mixture with 40 ml PCR mixtures and using 5U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). In particular, RT-PCR amplification for RSV RNA and subsequent genotyping by nested PCR, was performed using previously described protocols [Coiras et al., 2003] ; hMPV RNA was amplified using primer pairs encompassing a 150-bp region of the N-gene of all known hMPV subtypes, as described elsewhere [Debiaggi et al., 2006 ]; a novel hCoV amplification strategy was designed in order to allow the detection of both hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E, as well as the amplification of SARS-CoV, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-HKU1. In particular four degenerated primers (Forward primers: PanCoVfw and PanCoVfw2, reverse primers: PanCoVr and PanCoVr2, respectively) were included in the hCoV family specific PCR reaction. The hMPV amplification protocol ensured the detection of 5 copies with comparable sensitivity for all hMPV subtypes; similarly, a sensitivity level of less than 10 copies for all hCoV genotypes (SARS-CoV included) was observed (data not shown). Finally, to detect hBoV DNA, a previously published PCR protocol was used [Allander et al., 2005] ; to further define the subtype of positive samples, a second PCR targeting a more variable region of the viral genome was performed using a second couple of primers (BocaGenoFW and BocaGe-noRW) ( Table I) . These primers were designed on the alignments based on GenBank-published virus sequences. The sensitivity of all amplification protocols, was determined by cloning each amplified target region into pCR2.1 plasmid vector (TA Cloning Kit; Invitrogen), serially diluted from 10 6 copies to 1 copy processed in parallel. To reduce the impact of known or possible base mismatches with virus variants, annealing temperatures allowing hybridization of primers even in the presence of minimal sequence variations were used. RSV genotyping was possible by direct observation on agarose gel after electrophoresis of the nested PCR products. All positive viral amplification products (except for RSV) were sequenced in both directions by using BigDye Terminator v3.1 and an ABI 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) to confirm amplification specificity and to allow subsequent phylogenetic analysis. PCR products were sequenced with the same primers used in the amplification protocols, except for hMPV, where primers FwseqMPV and RevseqMPV were designed for resequencing.",

            "text": "Several aspects of the data shown require a comment. Firstly, the role of RSV as a major respiratory pathogen of infants is not influenced by the co-circulation of other emerging viral agents with similar seasonal distribution. Indeed, 90 out of 322 cases of ARD tested in this 2-years study (28.0% of the total, and 60.0% of the 150 cases diagnosed etiologically) were associated with RSV infection, in most of the patients as a unique pathogen. Secondly, the study confirms previous observations that hMPV infection may be associated in infants with L-ARD, but the severity of the disease associated with this viral agent is generally lower than that observed with RSV [van Woensel et al., 2006] . Notably, hMPV type B was associated to more clinically severe disease than hMPV type A in our study. Thirdly, the data shown extend the evaluation on the role as respiratory pathogens in infants, to the recently identified hCoVs and hBoVs. While the molecular epidemiology of these recently identified agents, as appears by J. Med. Virol. DOI 10.1002/jmv the present analysis, confirms their widespread circulation as seasonal respiratory pathogens (or, in a large proportion of the cases, as co-pathogens), the data indicate a lower pathogenic potential than that exhibited by RSV, that was the only virus associated with hypoxia and respiratory complications (clinically evaluated). All the other viruses (hMPV, hCoVs and hBoVs) were detected in a high proportion of infants in this cohort as co-pathogens. Notably, RSV-hMPVs co-infections were significantly observed in less severe respiratory diseases when compared to unique RSV infections. This observation is in agreement with other analyses documenting that co-infections are normally not observed in mechanically ventilated children, where unique RSV infections are frequently detected [Lazar et al., 2004; van Woensel et al., 2006 ]. On the other hand, this finding is in contrast with other studies, where the dualinfection with RSV and hMPV was associated with severe diseases [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005] . Whether our observation is due to a different epidemiological distribution of pathogens, or to the virus specific virus-host interactions remains to be determined. Indeed, respiratory viruses, including the recently described emerging agents are widespread agents, as demonstrated by their very early age of infection, and the high proportion of co-infections observed in the cases described here. Theoretically, several host and viral features may influence the clinical outcome in these co-infections. These features may include, on the one hand, a modified cytokine induction profile, and on the other hand, interferon susceptibility of the viral agents [Huck et al., 2007] . As an example, during the SARS-CoV epidemics, a large proportion of hMPV co-infections were observed, but no significant association with a worse prognosis was demonstrated, and an opportunistic role was suggested [Chan et al., 2003] . Whether this feature is linked to specific SARS-CoV characteristics, including the high degree of resistance to alpha interferon [Scagnolari et al., 2004] , or if the same type of interactions could be observed in other co-infections should be clarified in the near future. However, the data show that co-infections with these agents are not rare and occasional events.",

A high proportion of patients infected by hCoV-NL63 (8/10), hCoV-HKU1 (3/6), and hCoV-OC43 (6/11), at hospital admission presented a diagnosis of bronchiolitis or pneumonia, in agreement with previous observations [Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965; van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Sloots et al., 2006] . Furthermore, previous reports have shown a high prevalence of underlying diseases and a high frequency of gastrointestinal diseases in hCoV-HKU1 infected patients [Vabret et al., 2006] , but this study cannot confirm this observation, since only one case of diarrhea was observed and no predisposing conditions were documented. The same observation was done for hBoV infections, that has been reported in patients with gastroenteritis and ARD, but that in only one out of the seven cases of this cohort of patients was associated with diarrhea at diagnosis or during hospitalization. For hCoV-HKU1, phylogenetic analysis documented the co-circulation of two distinct genotypes; similarly, for the newly identified hBoVs, two co-circulating subtypes were also detected [Lau et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2007] . For hMPV infection, the amplified region of the hMPV genome offered enough phylogenetic signal to identify at least four subtypes correctly. The proportion between subtype B and A did not change during the two epidemic seasons, ranging between 24% and 33%; the B strains seem to circulate at alternate seasons, even if within subtype cross-neutralization has been described in vitro and in animal studies. Further study may clarify this crucial issue for vaccines production or passive immunotherapeutic strategies.",

Using molecular detection, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis, the study has evaluated the clinical impact of infections with single pathogens and co-infections with two or more agents. The data highlight that RSV maintains a distinct role as a respiratory pathogen of infants, that the wide circulation of other viruses does not reduce the clinical relevance of this virus, and that the recently identified agents (including hMPVs, hBoVs, and hCoV) may act as primary pathogens or co-pathogens. The bio-pathology of co-infections by respiratory viruses should be addressed further with specific in vitro and in vivo analyses.",
