Transmission to the vertebrate host, initiated by flagellated metacyclic promastigotes, is via the bite of an infected female sandfly vector. Once within the mammalian host, the parasite enters the macrophage, where it transforms into the replicative amastigote stage. Depending both on the species initiating infection and on the immunological status of the host, disease forms range from simple cutaneous and mucocutaneous to diffuse cutaneous and visceral. Leishmania major is a well-studied Old World species that causes cutaneous disease in humans and mice (Farrell, 2002).",

Since main targets of CsA are cyclophilins, sensitivity of protozoan infection to CsA suggested an important role that cyclophilins may play in protozoan life cycle. Cyclophilins are a large family of proteins that possess peptidyl\u2013prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase activity and are believed to play an important role in cell physiology as chaperones (Barik, 2006) and regulators of protein folding (Kofron et al., 1991). In addition to their intracellular functions, some cyclophilins can be released by cells in response to various stimuli such as inflammatory mediators, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sherry et al., 1992, Xu et al., 1992, Jin et al., 2000, Suzuki et al., 2006). These extracellular cyclophilins exert potent chemotactic activity towards many types of immune cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, acute lung injury or allergic asthma (Arora et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2005, Gwinn et al., 2006; reviewed in Yurchenko et al., 2006). A ubiquitously expressed membrane protein, CD147, has been shown to play a critical role in the signaling responses of mammalian cells to extracellular cyclophilins and to contribute to a variety of cyclophilin-mediated physiological and pathological activities (reviewed in Yurchenko et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Cyclophilins are produced by many protozoan parasites. Interestingly, several trypanosomatids, e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi, secrete a cyclophilin-like protein during the host cell infection and antibodies raised against the T. cruzi isomerase greatly reduce parasite\u2019s infectivity (Moro et al., 1995). These results suggest that parasites might secrete cyclophilin to initiate signaling events in the target cells, thus creating the optimal environment for entry and replication. Three isoforms of Leishmania major cyclophilin (LmCyp) with molecular masses of 18, 19 and 22 kDa have been identified (Hoerauf et al., 1997, Rascher et al., 1998). The 19 kDa protein (LmCyp19) is the major isoform of LmCyp; the other two isoforms may result from post-translational modification or degradation of this cyclophilin (Rascher et al., 1998). The role of LmCyp19 in the parasite\u2019s life cycle remains uncharacterized. The enzymatic peptidyl\u2013prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase activity of LmCyp isoforms was greatly reduced by CsA, however, unlike human cyclophilin A, the complex of LmCyp19 with CsA did not bind to the Ca-regulated phosphatase calcineurin (Rascher et al., 1998). Surprisingly, pretreatment of parasites with CsA did not diminish the level of macrophage infection (Hoerauf et al., 1997). Structural studies of cyclophilin of another species of Leishmania, Leishmania donovani, revealed complete structural conservation of the cyclosporin-binding site with respect to the homologous human protein, with deviations primarily in the loop regions (Venugopal et al., 2007). Given that interaction of human cyclophilin with CD147 is sensitive to CsA and involves the enzymatically active site of cyclophilin (Yurchenko et al., 2002), we hypothesized that secreted LmCyp19 may facilitate parasite infection by inducing CD147-dependent signaling in target macrophages.",

We demonstrate that, unlike human cyclophilins, LmCyp19 does not interact with human CD147 on the surface of target cells, and CD147 facilitates neither Leishmania binding nor infection. Comparative analysis of LmCyp19 and human CypA revealed that the Leishmania protein is defective in heparan binding, which is required for CypA-initiated signal transduction. Restoration of the heparan binding capacity of LmCyp19 by mutagenesis also restored CD147-mediated signaling activity.",

We hypothesized that Leishmania-produced LmCyp19 might function in a similar manner by interacting with CD147 and facilitating infection by the parasite. For quantitative analysis of the role of CD147 in Leishmania infection, we employed CHO cell lines stably transfected with human CD147 (CHO.CD147) or empty pcDNA3.1 vector (CHO.pcDNA) as negative control. The CHO cells were proposed as an ideal in vitro model for studying host\u2013parasite interactions (Guinet et al., 2000) because they are relatively easy to culture and infect. These cell lines have been characterized previously (Yurchenko et al., 2001, Yurchenko et al., 2002). Fig. 1\na shows that both CHO.pcDNA and CHO.CD147 cell lines were equally infected with L. major. Although a small difference in infection rate between these two cell lines was noticed, it was not statistically significant. It remained possible that infection by L. major was facilitated by the hamster CD147 present on CHO cells. To exclude this possibility, we used the anti-CD147 antibody (clone UM-8D6) that was previously shown to block CD147-dependent CypA-induced signaling events in CHO.CD147 cells (Yurchenko et al., 2002). This experiment did not detect any difference in parasite infection in the presence or absence of the antibody (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, consistent with previously published observations (Meissner et al., 2003), the presence of CsA during infection reduced the rate of infected cells from approximately 45% in non-treated CHO.CD147 cells to approximately 20% in the presence of 1 \u03bcg/ml CsA (Fig. 1b).",

An example of such an analysis (ratio 2:1) is presented in Fig. 1c, which shows that CHO.pcDNA and CHO.CD147 cells bind to Leishmania with similar efficiency. Moreover, pre-treatment of CHO.CD147 cells with the blocking antibody to CD147 did not appreciably change the level of parasite binding. Therefore, CD147 is not essential for Leishmania infection.",

It has been proposed that parasites express on their surface or secrete a high-affinity heparan-binding protein which can interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on mammalian cells (Butcher et al., 1992). This interaction may represent an important first step in cell-to-cell transmission of Leishmania amastigotes. Since CypA binds to heparan sulphates (Saphire et al., 1999), we hypothesized that heparans, rather than CD147, may function as receptors for LmCyp19 to facilitate infection by the parasite. We first tested whether heparan-sulfates are important for promastigote binding. In addition to CHO.pcDNA and CHO.CD147 cell lines, we used two cell lines lacking heparan-sulfates, CHO.pgsB-618.pcDNA and CHO.pgsB-618.CD147. To remove heparans, we also pretreated CHO.CD147 cells with heparitinase III, which cleaves heparans at \u03b1-N-acetylglucosaminide-l-iduronic acid (Yurchenko et al., 2002). As shown in Fig. 1c, in the absence of proteoglycans the binding of L. major promastigotes was greatly diminished indicating that, similar to amastigotes, binding to heparan-sulfates on the cell surface facilitates infection by promastigotes. As has been noted before, this interaction might represent an important initial step in Leishmania infection. Again, the presence of human CD147 did not appreciably change L. major binding.",

            "text": "To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed differences between LmCyp19 and human CypA, we compared the primary structures of these proteins (Fig. 3\n). It has previously been shown that F60A and H126A mutations result in an almost complete loss of the rotamase activity, the F113A mutant retains only about 10% of the rotamase activity of the wild-type protein (Zydowsky et al., 1992), and W121 does not affect rotamase activity but is essential for Cyp-CsA interaction (Liu et al., 1991). All amino acids forming the Cyp active site (F60, F113, W121 and H126, numbered according to the human protein) are conserved in LmCyp19 (Fig. 3, shaded). Consistent with this analysis, the isomerase activity of LmCyp19 was only slightly lower than that of CypA (Table 1). In contrast, two out of four basic amino acids (R48, K51, K54 and K55) determining heparan binding activity of human CypA (Yurchenko et al., 2002) are not conserved in LmCyp19, where lysines in positions 164 and 168 (corresponding to K51 and K55 of CypA) are substituted with threonine and proline, respectively (Fig. 3, in bold). To verify that lysine to threonine and lysine to proline substitutions in positions 164 and 168 of LmCyp19 are critical for the observed differences between human and Leishmania cyclophilins, we changed these residues back to lysines. The mutant LmCyp19 regained the ability to bind heparans (Fig. 2c). Most importantly, it became capable of initiating CD147-dependent signaling, as it induced ERKs phosphorylation in CHO.CD147 (Fig. 2b, lane 8) but not in CHO.pcDNA cells (Fig. 2b, lane 4). Introduced mutations did not affect isomerase activity of LmCyp19 (Table 1).",

            "text": "For human CypA and CypB, two types of binding sites have been identified (Denys et al., 1998, Yurchenko et al., 2002). The type I sites are the specific functional receptors mediating internalization and signaling of bound cyclophilins, while the type II sites are represented by sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Recently, it was demonstrated that syndecan-1, one of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan core proteins, is physically associated with CD147 and is necessary for signaling and chemotactic activity of CypB (Pakula et al., 2007). We proposed that CypA binds first to heparans on the cell surface in order to be presented to its Type I receptor (CD147) for a more efficient interaction (Yurchenko et al., 2002). A similar function of heparans has been described for many chemoattractive agents, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) or chemokine regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) (Schonherr and Hausser, 2000). It appears that due to the K164T and K168P substitutions, LmCyp19 is unable to bind heparans as efficiently as its human counterpart, thus its inability to induce signaling via CD147. This structural peculiarity of LmCyp19 also argues against its role in heparan-dependent binding of L. major to target cells.",

In contrast to CypA, LmCyp19 does not interact with CD147 and does not induce CD147-dependent signaling. Since cyclophilins mediate inflammatory responses via interaction with CD147 (Yurchenko et al., 2006), this feature of LmCyp19 may help Leishmania avoid chemoattracting immune cells to the site of infection. Given high conservation of the rotamase site in LmCyp19, the role of LmCyp19 in the parasite\u2019s infection likely concerns chaperone functions, but it does not seem to contribute directly to the parasite\u2019s interaction with the target cell. While it remains to be determined whether LmCyp19 is secreted, our results indicate that its extracellular activity is unlikely to be a factor in disease pathogenesis.",
