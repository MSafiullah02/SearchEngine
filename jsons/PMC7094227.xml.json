Not only were lay people alarmed, but medical personnel were also frightened. SARS differs from other infectious diseases in that it manifests as an intra-hospital infection and not as a mass community infection. Taiwan hospitals were overwhelmed by the number of cases. The medical staff was anxious and fearful, and some chose to leave their jobs. Their mental health seemed to be affected more than that of the patients due to caring for the patients as well as facing concerns of becoming infected themselves. This rapidly emerging infectious disease has not been well investigated throughout the world. Most research reports focused on the treatment of the disease. They rarely discussed the mental state of health professionals caring for SARS patients.",

When WHO issued a warning in March 2003, many lay people and medical professionals worldwide had already been infected (Lee and Lin, 2003). By July 2003, the number of cases reached 8437, resulting in 813 deaths (WHO, 2003). The mortality rate was highest in Mainland China, followed by Hong Kong and Taiwan. The mortality rate for medical personnel was highest in Taiwan. From the data, we can see the immediate and great impact of the virus on global health systems, disease prevention, education, and the economy within a short period.",

This posture was evident during the early days of AIDS, probably the greatest challenge to nursing in the 20th century. Research showed that more than half of the nurses in Taiwan preferred to care for AIDS patients. About 33\u201350% would resign rather than care for them (Yeh et al., 1990; Su et al., 1992). Nurses were frightened that they or their family members could become infected through frequent contact with body fluids (Ko et al., 2002). International studies demonstrated that lack of knowledge about AIDS led to exaggerated reports of infection risks and reduced nurses\u2019 volition to care for AIDS patients. In contrast to the present, due to the increased knowledge of AIDS and its transmission, nursing staff show a more positive attitude and willingness to care for AIDS patients (Yeh et al., 1990; McCann, 1997; Valimaki et al., 1998).",

When a disease causes deaths among health care workers, it is understandable that they become terrified. From a survey of Canadian medical staff, the SARS epidemic provoked several reactions. They were discouraged from face-to-face contact with people outside the hospital. Since masks were removed while eating, they usually ate alone. Those who had possible contact with SARS patients were isolated voluntarily for 10 days as they were concerned about themselves or family members becoming infected. Staff members who did not have direct contact with SARS patients were on call at all times. Some workers avoided letting others people know where they worked. Thus, it is evident that medical staff would have strong emotional reactions like restlessness, fear, anger, or frustration. They were working under extremely stressful conditions unlike the world outside the hospital. Except for pregnancy, staff members assigned to SARS patients could not refuse their assignments. These workers experienced fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and anorexia. Lastly, their feelings were further complicated when they had to care for infected colleagues (Maunder et al., 2003).",

The virus also can spread when people touch a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes. Therefore, the chance of infection is much higher than with AIDS. Care of a SARS patient requires an isolation area with one or two patients per nurse; thus, more nursing staff is required. Nurses who were usually assigned to clinics, surgical wards, obstetrics and gynecology, and neurology were incorporated into the care roster after brief training. In addition, with the hospital becoming a designated SARS center so rapidly, setting up isolation rooms consisting of an anteroom and a clean zone was not possible due to insufficient equipment. Thus, the patient's room itself became an isolation room. The nursing staff was equipped with full-body protective gear for 6\u20138 h (double-layered protective gear, double layered masks, double layered gloves, isolating caps, foot wraps, and protective glasses) under high temperature and negative pressure. To avoid becoming infected when removing the protective equipment, the personnel could not eat, drink, or use the bathroom during their working hours. Many became dehydrated due to excessive sweating, and consequently, some developed cystitis and skin rashes. Working in the isolation areas required the staff to have frequent, close patient contact while turning patients, performing back percussion, sputum suction, and venipuncture. Under these dangerous exposures, the staff grew mentally and physically exhausted, and began to doubt the value and meaning of life. All this led to anxious and depressive emotional disturbances.",

Ho-Ping Hospital was forced to close due to the lack of a comprehensive plan in against cross-infection in the hospital. The plan included in-service training, manpower allocation, a sufficient supply of protective equipment, and establishment of a mental health team. Two weeks after caring for SARS patients and the initiation of the SARS prevention program, the questionnaire was answered for a second time. The third time was 1 month after the SARS prevention program began. By then moderate anxiety had decreased to mild anxiety and the level of depression lessened. With GEE analysis controlling for time variables and possible factors, coping strategies and the implementation of the SARS prevention program were the confounding factors. Due to their nursing training, the staff would adopt coping strategies to buffer the negative impact of work stress. The coping mechanisms, which were developed by Aguilera (1990) based on Caplan's theory, refer to the usual patterns of reaction when a subject faces a problem. These reactions were repeatedly learned from the individual's daily life because they effectively decrease anxiety and nervousness. Individuals are more confident when they believe that they can effectively manage current situations. Therefore, the perceived control of certain circumstances will affect their choice and insistence on coping strategies. The more frequent coping strategies of nursing staff from previous studies are understanding a new principle, objectively analyzing current situations, reading related books, or exchanging ideas with colleagues. Therefore, coping mechanisms could decrease the anxiety and depression levels of the nursing staff. On the other hand, the implementation of the SARS prevention program is a possible intervention that also decreased anxiety and depression levels. As illustrated by Shieh (2003), in-service training and manpower allocation are important components in a disease prevention program. These plans help nursing staff to better understand the disease and preventive measures as well as provide correct and current information. Besides, working hours and holidays were scheduled to ensure that staff had sufficient rest time. At 2 weeks and at 1 month after implementation of the SARS prevention program, the sleep quality score dropped significantly from 12 to 10, indicating some improvement. However, when 5 points is the cut-off point (<5 equals good sleep quality while \u2a7e5 indicates poor sleep quality), the nursing staff still exhibited poor sleep quality. One possible reason could be the changing work schedule. Other research has shown that nurses\u2019 sleep quality is affected by schedule changes or working at night due the disturbance of their biological clocks. A disrupted biological clock can increase a person's sensitivity to stress. Sleep pattern adjustment requires at least 6 days. Most common sleeping problems experienced by those who work nights are difficulties in falling asleep, sleeping less than 6 h, and being unable to fall asleep after being awoken (Fraser and Filler, 1989; Harma, 1993; Tseng et al., 1995).",

Staff who had been mildly anxious and depressed became no longer anxious and depressed. Thus, when the burden of caring for SARS patients was removed, anxiety and depression ceased to exist. Although the mean sleep quality score improved from 10 to 8, sleep quality was still poor. Perhaps a longer time is required for sleep patterns to return to their usual state. In addition, working varying schedules could be another factor that affects sleep quality. Further research in this area could prove fruitful.",

Some students in nursing schools changed their course of study (Lee and Lin, 2003). The tremendous challenges and impact on available nurses, working environment, and ethical issues were evident. The prevention programs also played a very important role in combatting the potential lethal epidemics. Rigid standard precautions were taken against cross-contamination in the hospital as well as in the city. Procedures for wearing and removal and disinfection of P100 masks, the route of the SARS wards, entering preparation room, entering buffer zone, and entering the negative pressure room were carefully planned in advance. Therefore, the outbreak of the epidemic could be controlled in a limited time. Our research demonstrated that nurses grew anxious and depressed during the SARS epidemic and did not sleep well. However, with a systematic SARS prevention program that included a series of in-service training, detailed manpower allocation, adequate protective equipment, and the availability of a mental health team, the nursing staff had decreased their anxiety and depression levels along with improving their sleep quality. The nursing staff can provide better patient care when they themselves are physically and mentally capable. In summary, the rapid deployment of a comprehensive prevention program should be a priority of governmental authorities when facing an epidemic. Isolation rooms, instruction in the proper use of safety equipment, and allocation of medical personnel will allow health care workers to care for patients without additional stresses.",
