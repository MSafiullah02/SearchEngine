With sites like Twitter, Facebook etc., users are provided with a platform to post emotions, views, and likings about various topics, people, product, and services. Opinions expressed in social media can be classified to determine the orientation (negative, positive, and neutral) of the posted text. Sentiment strength and intensity of the post are determined with the aim to identify opinion and emotion of the user about a specific product or service.\n",

It is important to identify who is prominent. Their proposed work combined open source software and hardware phenomenon. Data download speed is increased with the help of network-based application. Latency and network delays are removed. Reliable connection between source and sink is established using application on Twitter side. Their work shows how data available in HDFS is processed with help of Hive and Pig. To coordinate and schedule the processes, they used Oozie.

Lexicon dictionary of sentiment words using SentiWordNet is generated. All possible usage of a word is obtained to determine the overall sentiment of the word and updated in the dictionary. They used numbering approach to assign suitable range for different sentiments. To reduce the search time dictionary is stored local memory. Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm is implemented using chained MapReduce jobs to process each tweet and assign sentiment to each word. PMR-IR algorithm is implemented to determine orientation of phrases. Sentiment of tweet is computed by aggregating the sentiments for each word in tweet. Overall accuracy of 72% is achieved.

Because of the complexities of Arabic language, a custom text preprocessing module is developed to clean the text. Sentiment analysis module is developed using Hive UDF. Lexicon based on MPQA is manually updated with 1100 negative and 850 positive words. Lexicon is translated into Arabic for this work. Their proposed sentiment detection algorithm can search up to 5 consecutive composite words in polarity lexicon and can detect negation on opinion. Proposed algorithm can identify positive word affected by non-consecutive negative word.

Dictionary consists of all forms of words to avoid stemming each word to increase processing time. Negation and blind negation words that reverse the polarity of sentence are included in the dictionary. Sentiment analysis is performed by combining the polarity of the word its strength to compute the sentiment score with score 0 as neutral polarity. Sentence polarity is aggregation of words score. Polarity of sentence is reversed when blind negation word is identified in the sentence.

Their research demonstrated clustering algorithms: canopy and k-means algorithms. Canopy algorithm differs from traditional algorithm as it uses two computing distance methods and computes only overlapping data vectors. Mahout\u2019s built-in Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm for classification, Apriori and FP-tree algorithms for pattern mining are presented. Mahout used Parallel Frequent Pattern Mining. Firstly identifying one-dimensional frequent items and then dividing original data set into different groups based on frequent items. FP-tree is computed for each group. FP-tree is mining to get frequent items, and result is obtained by merging each FP-tree frequent items.

Data parser would return the desired number of positive and negative reviews on request to WFC. WFC manages work flow of the whole system and stores data set in HDFS for training. Training job, combining job, and classifier job were executed in sequence. The training job builds a model that computes the polarity of each word based on the frequency of word. The combining job generates an intermediate table by associating the test data with the model, excluding the words that appear in test data but not in the model. Classifier job then classifies reviews into positive or negative and output the results into HDFS. The statistics of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative were recorded. Result collector would retrieve the model, intermediate table, classification result, and statistics of test from HDFS. User terminal was used to submit user jobs and results were accessible in user terminal after result collected finished collection. The scalability of the algorithm in Hadoop was tested with accuracy of 82% with changing the data set size from one thousand to one million in each class.Scaling Archived Social Media Data Analysis Using a Hadoop Cloud\n",

Approximately, 3.5 million messages per day can be processed using COSMOS API. Collection of virtual machines makes Hadoop cluster. OpenNebula helps decide size and characteristics of Hadoop cluster. Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) manages virtualization within resources. MapReduce paradigm processes each tweet in parallel using SentiStrength. SentiStrength estimates the strength of word in scale of \u22121 to \u22125 for negative opinion and 1\u20135 for positive opinion.

Twitter data is collected using Search API, and Facebook data is collected using Graph API. Each message is processed using natural processing techniques using MapReduce technique on Hadoop. MapReduce accelerated the analysis speed. Lexicon-based algorithm is developed to measure sentiment of score of each word. They defined five corpora which includes positive, negative, modifiers, conjunction, and point of interest words with sentiment rating ranging from \u22125 to 5. LexTo tool is used to tokenize words in each sentence. DOM implements MapReduce program to generate jobs that detects words in each sentence in parallel. Non-related sentences were discarded by matching words in point of interests. DOM then computes the sentiment score using positive and negative words in corpora. Sentiment score is inverted when modifier is adjacent to sentiment words. DOM engine can classify messages and perform sentiment analysis with accuracy of over 75% when compared to Human analysis. DOM engine was tested on general public opinion expressed in social network to determine political climate around end of 2013.Customer Preference Analysis Based on SNS Data\n",
