            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV\u20102) is responsible for haemorrhagic enteritis in dogs (Carmichael and Binn, 1981). CPV\u20102 emerged in the late 1970s but in a few years it was replaced completely by two antigenic variants, named types 2a and 2b, that are characterized by amino acid substitutions occurring in the capsid protein (VP1/VP2) gene (Parrish et al., 1988). While the original type 2 is no longer circulating in the dog population and is present only in vaccine formulations (Parrish et al., 1991), its antigenic variants are distributed worldwide (Mochizuki et al., 1993; De Ybanez et al., 1995; Greenwood et al., 1996; Truyen et al., 1996, 2000; Sagazio et al., 1998; Steinel et al., 1998; Buonavoglia et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000; Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Martella et al., 2004, 2005b; Decaro et al., 2005a, 2005c, 2006b; Desario et al., 2005). Real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on minor groove binder (MGB) probe technology have been developed for rapid characterization of the antigenic variants, taking advantage of single nucleotide polymorphisms occurring in the VP1/VP2 gene (Decaro et al., 2006b). An additional MGB probe assay has also been established for discrimination between vaccine and field strains of CPV (Decaro et al., 2006a).",

In previous studies, both genotypes were detected simultaneously in the faecal samples of most dogs infected with CCoV (Pratelli et al., 2004; Decaro et al., 2005f). Moreover, it has been shown that CCoV can exacerbate the clinical course of concurrent infections caused by CPV\u20102, by damaging the intestinal villi and enhancing the mitotic activity of the crypt cells where CPV replicates (Evermann et al., 1980; Yasoshima et al., 1983; Pratelli et al., 1999).",

The involvement of the entire litter in terms of morbility and mortality could be related to a poor protection against the CPV variants by MDA for the original type 2, rather than to a failure in the transfer of MDA from the bitch to its offspring (Decaro et al., 2004b). Because of the physico\u2010chemical properties of CPV\u20102 (high resistance in the environment with long persistence in kennels and shelters), a good vaccine should prevent the disease as well as the viral shedding by dogs eventually infected. Dogs with HI MDA titres \u22651 : 80 are considered protected against disease and viral shedding after challenge with virulent CPV\u20102 (Pollock and Carmichael, 1982). However, more recently it has been observed that pups with HI MDA titres up to 1 : 160, conventionally considered protective from CPV infection (Pollock and Carmichael, 1982), were infected by CPV\u20102b and shed virus in their faeces (Decaro et al., 2005e; Elia et al., 2005). Consequently, the minimal MDA level required for protection from CPV infection has to be reconsidered (Decaro et al., 2005e). The present report stresses the need to update the CPV vaccines, by replacing the original type 2 (\u2018ghost\u2019 virus) with the CPV variants currently circulating (Martella et al., 2005a; Truyen, 2006).",
