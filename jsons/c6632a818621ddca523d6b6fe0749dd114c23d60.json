During the sudden onset of a crisis situation, affected people post useful information on Twitter that can be used for situational awareness and other humanitarian disaster response efforts, if processed timely and effectively. Processing social media information pose multiple challenges such as parsing noisy, brief and informal messages, learning information categories from the incoming stream of messages and classifying them into different classes among others. One of the basic necessities of many of these tasks is the availability of data, in particular human-annotated data. In this paper, we present human-annotated Twitter corpora collected during 19 different crises that took place between 2013 and 2015. To demonstrate the utility of the annotations, we train machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we publish first largest word2vec word embeddings trained on 52 million crisis-related tweets. To deal with tweets language issues, we present human-annotated normalized lexical resources for different lexical variations.",

            "text": "Twitter has been extensively used as an active communication channel, especially during mass convergence events such as natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, typhoons (Imran et al., 2015; Hughes and Palen, 2009 ). During the onset of a crisis, a variety of information is posted in real-time by affected people; by people who are in need of help (e.g., food, shelter, medical assistance, etc.) or by people who are willing to donate or offer volunteering services. Moreover, humanitarian and formal crisis response organizations such as government agencies, public health care NGOs, and military are tasked with responsibilities to save lives, reach people who need help, etc. . Situation-sensitive requirements arise during such events and formal disaster response agencies look for actionable and tactical information in real-time to effectively estimate early damage assessment, and to launch relief efforts accordingly. Recent studies have shown the importance of social media messages to enhance situational awareness and also indicate that these messages contain significant actionable and tactical information (Cameron et al., 2012; Imran et al., 2013; Purohit et al., 2013) . Many Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) techniques such as automatic summarization, information classification, named-entity recognition, information extraction can be used to process such social media messages (Bontcheva et al., 2013; Imran et al., 2015) . However, many social media messages are very brief, informal, and often contain slangs, typograpical errors, abbreviations, and incorrect grammar (Han et al., 2013) . These issues degrade the performance of many NLP techniques when used down the processing pipeline (Ritter et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2011) . We present Twitter corpora consisting of more than 52 million crisis-related messages collected during 19 different crises. We provide human annotations (volunteers and crowd-sourced workers) of two types. First, the tweets are annotated with a set of categories such as displaced people, financial needs, infrastructure, etc. These annotation schemes were built using input taken from formal crisis response agencies such as United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). Second, the tweets are annotated to identify out-of-vocabulary(OOV) terms, such as slangs, places names, abbreviations, misspellings, etc. and their corrections and normalized forms. This dataset can form the basis for research in text classification for short messages and for research on normalizing informal language.",

However, since our dataset was used for disaster relief efforts, volunteers were willing to annotate it; this work can now be leveraged to improve text classification and language processing tasks. Our work provides annotations for around 50,000 thousand messages, which is a significant corpus, that will enable research into applied machine learning and consequently benefit the disaster relief (and other) research communities. Our dataset has been collected from various countries and during various times of the year. This diversity would make it an interesting dataset that if used would be a foil to solutions that only work for specific language \"dialects\", e.g., American English and would fail or suffer from degradation of quality if applied to variations, such as Indian English. Our work shows that when a dataset is used for a real application, we could obtain larger number of annotations than otherwise. These can then be used to improve text processing as a byproduct.",

AIDR is an open source platform to collect and classify Twitter messages during the onset of a humanitarian crisis. AIDR has been used by UN OCHA during many major disasters such as Nepal Earthquake, Typhoon Hagupit. AIDR provides different convenient ways to collect messages from Twitter using the Twitter's streaming API. One can use different data collection strategies. For example, collecting tweets that contain some keywords and are specifically from a particular geographical area/region/city (e.g. New York).

The class imbalance problem has been known to hinder the learning performance of classification algorithms. In this case, we performed another round of annotations for datasets that have high class imbalance using the paid crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. 3 In both annotation processes, an annotation task consists of a tweet and the list of categories listed below. A paid worker or volunteer reads the message and selects one of the categories most suitable for the message. Messages that do not belong to any category but contain some important information are categorized as \"Other Useful Information\". A task is finalized (i.e. a category is assigned) when three different volunteers/paid workers agree on a category. According to the Twitter's data distribution policy, we are not allowed to publish actual contents of more than 50k tweets. For this reason, we publish all annotated tweets, which are less than 50k, along with tweet-ids of all the unannotated messages at http://CrisisNLP.qcri. org/. We also provide a tweets retrieval tool implemented in Java, which can be used to get full tweets content from Twitter.

            "text": "Many applications of machine learning and computational linguistics rely on semantic representations and relationships between words of a text document. Many different types of methods have been proposed that use continuous representations of words such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). How- ever, recently models based on distributional representations of words become more famous. In this work, we train word embeddings (i.e. distributed word representations) using the 52 million Twitter messages in our datasets and make it available to research community. To the best of our knowledge this is the first largest word embeddings that are trained on crisis-related tweets. We use word2vec, a very popular software to train word embedding (Mikolov et al., 2013) . As preprocessing, we replaced URLs, digits, and usernames with fixed constants and removed special characters. Finally, the word embeddings are generated using Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) architecture with negative sampling along with 300 word representation dimensionality.",

Typically, Twitter messages are brief, informal, noisy, unstructured, and often contain misspellings and grammatical mistakes. Moreover, due to Twitter's 140 character limit restriction, Twitter users intentionally shorten words by using abbreviations, acronyms, slangs, and sometimes words without spaces. The accuracy of natural language processing techniques would improve if we can identify the informal nature of the language in tweets and normalize OOV terms (Han et al., 2013) . We divide these lexical variations into the following five categories:",

The SCOWL dictionary is suitable for English spell checkers for most of English dialects. Although, the SCOWL dictionary contains places names (e.g. names of countries and famous cities), after testing it on Nepal Earthquake data, we found that its coverage is not complete and a large number of cities/towns of Nepal are missing.

A worker reads the given message and provides a correct OOV tag (i.e. slang/abbreviation/acronym, a location name, an organization name, a misspelled word, or a person name).
