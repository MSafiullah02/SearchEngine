            "text": "Viral infections still represent a major global public health problem. Although hundreds of viruses are known to be pathogenic, only less than 10 of them can be treated in clinic with available antiviral drugs. For some highly pathogenic virus such as Zika (ZIKV), Ebola (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as well as many others, there is still no effective drugs on market against them. Most of the antiviral drugs approved are designed to target viral proteins to inhibit viral infections, and they are named as direct\u2010acting antiviral agents (DAAs).\n1\n DAAs have been demonstrated to be very successful in clinic to combat viral infections, and are generally considered as very safe for human use because most of the targeted viral proteins have no human homologs. However, viral polymerases, one of the hottest targets for antiviral design, do share some structural similarity with their human counterparts, especially at the active sites, which is the major underlying reason for the toxicity observed with nucleoside\u2010based antivirals. In addition, viral proteins do not normally share structural similarity among different species or even genotypes of virus, and hence one antiviral agent targeting a specific viral protein can hardly impart the same inhibitory effects against the other virus. Consequently, the antiviral drugs available on market can barely be employed to treat newly emerging virus, and the magnitude of this problem is further exacerbated by the lack of broad\u2010spectrum antiviral drugs on market. The other inherent limitation of DAAs is that DAAs, in most cases, have low genetic barrier to drug resistance because they act directly on viral proteins, and the resulted selective pressure will facilitate the mutations of virus during replication, which will make the virus refractory to the treatment of DAAs.\n2\n Altogether, there still exist great unmet needs for the treatment of viral infections, and new antivirals with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities as well as new mechanism of action are highly demanded.",

            "text": "It is widely known that viruses are unable to complete their replication without the help of the host. They will hijack various host proteins or pathways throughout their replication cycle to facilitate their replication, and hence the inhibition or knockdown of such host proteins will block viral replication. Therefore, host proteins as such are potential antiviral targets for drug development. The host targeting antivirals (HTAs) are complementary to the DAAs, and are superior to DAAs from several aspects. Chiefly, a specific host protein might play crucial roles in the replication of several types of viruses, and thereby its inhibition will yield broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. HTAs as such are likely to be effective against newly emerging virus, because they may also leverage on the same host protein for replication. For example, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a host chaperone responsible for the folding, assembly, and maturation of endogenous proteins, is also found to be crucial for maturation of many viral proteins, and therefore, Hsp90 inhibitors are endowed with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities.\n3\n Altogether, targeting host factors is a very promising strategy with possibility to address the critical challenges faced with the DAAs. In this review, we summarize the recent advances made in HTAs from a medicinal chemistry standpoint, and the host targets are generally classified into three different categories based on the development stage of their corresponding inhibitors/modulators, namely the ones which reached Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, that have entered clinical trials and those in preclinical studies. The focus is mainly placed on the small\u2010molecule based HTAs, and the antibody or small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2010based strategy will not be included. For several well\u2010studied host targets with quite a lot of known inhibitors, because each one can stand alone as an independent review, and this review is not intended to be comprehensive, so for such targets, only a selection of representative inhibitors will be presented to discuss related issues.",

            "text": "It should be noted that chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist but not chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) antagonist has reached FDA approval. However, CXCR4 is discussed in this section because it is closely related to CCR5. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 belong to the superfamily of G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains, and both are involved in the entrance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus.\n4\n The glycoprotein 120 (gp120) on the surface of HIV envelop will bind to the CD4 receptor on the surface of T lymphocytes, leading to the conformation change of gp120. The gp120 will then bind to coreceptor CXCR4, CCR5, or both to facilitate the entrance of HIV virus.\n5\n HIV\u20101 virus can thus be broadly classified into three types based on the coreceptor tropism, namely the X4\u2010, R5\u2010, and dual\u2010tropic viruses. The feasibility of targeting CXCR4 or CCR5 for HIV therapy is supported by the fact that CCR5 mutations confer the host with resistance to HIV infection.\n6\n Ample studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 antagonists can block HIV\u20101 infection through CXCR4.\n7\n, \n8\n Generally, CXCR4 antagonist can be divided into two types: peptide and nonpeptide based. The peptide\u2010based antagonists were designed using the natural chemokines of CXCR4 as template, such as stromal cell\u2010derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF\u20101\u03b1) and viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP\u2010II), both of which can bind to and then activate CXCR4 to initiate downstream signaling pathway. For example, peptide V1 (1; Figure 1) was derived from the first 1 to 21 residues of VMIP\u2010II, and it can block the interaction between CXCR4 and HIV\u20101, and thereby inhibit the entry of both X4\u2010 and dual\u2010tropic HIV\u20101 virus. Interestingly, replacement of all the residues in 1 with all d\u2010amino acid lead to much more potent antiviral activities.\n9\n Due to the inherent limitation with the peptide\u2010based antagonist, several nonpeptide based antagonists have been developed. AMD3100 (2) was discovered by random screening, and it inhibited HIV\u20101 infection by disrupting the interaction between CXCR4 and HIV\u20101.\n10\n Encouragingly, it showed antiviral efficacy in X4 HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients in a phase II clinical trial. However, compound 2 lacks oral bioavailability due to its high positive charge, and cardiotoxicity was also reported in the clinical trial.\n11\n The structural optimization identified AMD3465 (3) with just one macrocyclic structure retained. This compound retained all the biological profiles of 2, and it showed improved antiviral activity (IC50: 1\u201010 nM). It also inhibited the replication of drug\u2010resistant virus strain (zidovudine).\n12\n AMD070 (4), a noncyclam derivative, was discovered by AnorMED as a new CXCR4 antagonist. It showed much improved oral bioavailability (rat: 20%; dog: 80%), but hepatotoxicity was observed in preclinical studies.\n13\n Further structural optimization led to GSK812397 (5) without the basic sidechain. It showed potent anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity with an IC50 value of 1.5 nM, and it did not show any detectable toxicity (>1000 nM) in in vitro assay. In addition, 5 also presented acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles with the oral bioavailability in the range between 10% and 21% among different species.\n14\n Further structural modification with constraining conformation (6) and/or opening up the tetrahydroquinoline ring (7) resulted in a series of new derivatives with retained anti\u2010HIV activities.\n15\n, \n16\n However, none of these compounds have been advanced into clinical trials.",

The underlying reasons are at least twofold: one major concern with the CXCR4 antagonist is the toxicity issue, especially that CXCR4\n18\n, \n19\n or SDF\u20101\u03b1\n20\n knockout mice die prenatally with multiple neurological, cardiac/vascular, and hematopoietic defects. Such potential adverse outcomes are exacerbated in the case of HIV treatment, wherein a life\u2010long treatment is required; the other minor issue with these CXCR4 antagonists is the lack of oral bioavailability. IV injection is not practical in the case of HIV treatment, because this will definitely hurt the compliance of the patients.",

            "text": "In comparison, the development of CCR5 antagonists for HIV treatment is much more successful. One CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (8; Figure 2) has been approved by FDA as HIV entry inhibitor in 2007.\n21\n With a long plasma half\u2010life (15\u201023 hours),\n22\n\n8 is administrated orally once daily. The clinical data showed that 8 is well tolerated in patients and it can significantly repress the viral load in R5\u2010infected HAART\u2010treatment experienced patients. Moreover, it is active against 200 clinically derived HIV\u20101 envelope\u2010recombinant pseudoviruses, with 100 of them being resistant to existing drug classes, demonstrating the merits of HTAs.\n23\n In the clinic, it is primarily recommended for the patients infected with R5\u2010tropic HIV virus, and a tropism test (although not approved by FDA) is highly required to determine the viral tropism population within the patient before the treatment to ensure treatment success. The first generation of the test (known as TROFILE) failed to distinguish R5 from R5/X4 mixed tropism, resulting in significant drug failure in clinic in R5/X4\u2010infected patients.\n24\n Therefore, 8 is just designated as a backup regimen, despite that a new reliable and cost\u2010efficient tropism test is available in clinic now. Interestingly, the combination of 8 with raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine led to faster reduction of 2\u2010long term repeat (2\u2010LTR+) newly infected cells and recovery of CD4+ T\u2010cell counts after 48 weeks of treatment,\n25\n and 8 in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors is being tested in clinic for preexposure prophylaxis.\n26\n However, the use of 8 is accompanied with severe side effects, and in some cases even life\u2010threatening conditions such as hepatotoxicity and heart attack were observed. To mitigate these limitations, the second generation of CCR5 antagonists have been developed. Two clinical candidates vicriviroc (9) \n27\n and aplaviroc (10) \n28\n have made to phase II trials. However, the studies were halted due to insufficient efficacy and observed hepatotoxicity for 9 and 10, respectively. Much of the subsequent medicinal chemistry effort is devoted to the structural modification toward 8 to 10, aiming to improve either efficacy and/or ADME profiles. For example, Pfizer discovered compound 8's structural analogue PF\u2010232798 (11),\n29\n which showed not only potent anti\u2010HIV activity (IC50: 2.0 nM) and moderate hERG inhibition (IC50: 12 \u03bcM), but also superior oral bioavailability as compared to 8. In addition, compound 11 is also active against maraviroc\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 isolate strain CC185. The data from phase\u2010II trials demonstrated its superior safety in patients with no adverse effects observed at a dosage up to 250 mg. However, no further data were disclosed after that.\n30\n GSK 163929 (12) with a 4,4\u2010disubstituted piperidine scaffold exhibited potent anti\u2010HIV activity and excellent pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles, but it did not progress to clinic trials due to toxicity concerns.\n31\n The other two representative new scaffolds derived from compound 8 are monocyclic piperidine amides and cyclic and acyclic urea\u2010piperidines. Some representative candidate compounds from these two series are shown in Figure 2. Among these compounds, only TAK\u2010220 (13) was progressed to phase\u2010I clinical trials.\n32\n However, no further update about the status of compound 13 has been reported. Inspired by the scaffold of 9 and 10, several new CCR5 antagonists have been devised as depicted in Figure 2.\n33\n The most promising antagonist among this series is the one developed by Incyte based on the structure of 10. INCB9471 (16) showed potent antiviral activity against R5 HIV\u20101 strains at IC50 values in sub\u2010nanomolar range. In addition, it presented excellent PK profiles with oral bioavailability being 100% and 95% in rat and dog, respectively.\n34\n As such, 16 has been advanced to phase II trials, and the data showed that it was well\u2010tolerated in humans. However, its clinical studies were halted due to business issues. Besides the chemotypes described above, CCR5 antagonists with miscellaneous scaffolds have also been discovered, yet none of them have made to clinical trials.\n35\n\n",

Although its specific antiviral mechanism of action remains largely uncertain, it is widely accepted that it elicits its antiviral efficacy via modulating host pathways. For example, 18 showed moderate inhibitory potency against inosine\u20105\u2032\u2010monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) with a K\ni value of around 250 nM, which is believed to be highly involved in the replication of various viruses (see below). In addition, several other mechanism of actions have also been proposed and evidenced: (a) direct inhibition of RNA polymerase by converting 18 to its triphosphate form to competitively bind to the nucleotides binding site in RNA polymerase\n37\n, \n38\n; (b) 18 can act as a mutagen by inserting into the viral RNA to push the virus beyond the threshold of error catastrophe\n39\n, \n40\n; (c) 18 shows immunomodulatory effect of shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype, which helps to clear virus infections.\n41\n Although the combination of 18 and interferon 2\u03b1 (IFN\u20102\u03b1) used to be the SOC for HCV treatment, it is notorious for several severe side effects. One major adverse effect associated with the use of 18 is hemolytic anemia.\n42\n To alleviate this unwanted effect, taribavirin (19) was developed as the prodrug of 18. Ideally, 19 can be metabolized to 18 mainly in the liver to target HCV\u2010infected hepatocytes, and hence the distribution of 18 within red blood cells will be significantly decreased, and thereby the development of hemolytic anemia will be subsequently eliminated. Indeed, the clinical data from phase III trials revealed that patients receiving 19 (fixed dosage 600 mg, BID) and IFN showed significantly lower rates of anemia as compared to the ones in 18 (1000\u20101200 mg) and IFN group (5.3% vs 24%).\n43\n However, the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates for 19 and 18 group are 38% and 52%, respectively, failing to demonstrate the noninferiority end point for efficacy. The ViSER\u20102 trials also failed to meet the noninferiority end points.\n44\n\n",

Initially, it was expected that the HCV treatment would not benefit much from the combination of RBV with other DAAs due to the safety concern associated with RBV. However, very interestingly, it has been found recently that RBV remained an indispensable component for the optimal treatment for some difficult\u2010to\u2010cure subgroups of HCV patients.\n45\n For example, in a phase 3 C\u2010EDGE studies, the combination of RBV with elbasvir/grazoprevir achieved much higher SVR (12 weeks, 93% [14/15] vs 78% [7/9]; 16 weeks, 100% [8/8] vs 60% [3/5], respectively) as compared to the group without RBV in patients infected with genotype 4 HCV.\n46\n In addition, RBV increased the barrier to resistance, especially in patients receiving DAAs with low barriers to resistance.

The important roles cyclophilin A (CypA) plays during HCV replication were found by an unexpected clinical finding. Cyclosporin A (CsA; 20; Figure 5), which shows high binding affinity to CypA, is an approved immunosuppressive drug. In a clinical trial for CsA's therapeutic potential against hepatitis\u2010associated inflammation, it was unexpectedly found that a significantly more potent antiviral response was observed in the combination group of CsA and IFN\u2010\u03b12b as compared with the IFN\u2010\u03b12b alone group.\n47\n The function of CypA in the replication of HCV was subsequently confirmed in vitro.\n48\n The main cellular function of Cyps is to convert the conformation (trans\u2010 to cis\u2010form) of prolines in the protein, which is essential for trafficking of many proteins and forming protein complexes, and these functions are also indispensable for the replication of HCV. Therefore, it is anticipated that the CypA inhibitors will show anti\u2010HCV activity. Although 20 is an approved drug, its main indication is suppressing immunoreaction after organ transplantation, which is an unwanted \u201cside\u2010effect\u201d for antivirals. Fortunately, the immnosuppressive effect of 20 is attributed to the inhibition of calcineurin (CN) but not CypA, and hence it is feasible to eliminate the immnosuppressive effect while retaining the anti\u2010HCV activity by making new CsA analogues. NIM811 (21) is one of such analogues with a methyl\u2010isoleucine at position 4 of CsA. It showed anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro with an IC50 value of 0.12 \u03bcM, whereas its immunosuppressive effect was completely eliminated.\n49\n The phase I clinical trial showed that 21 is well\u2010tolerated with no obvious adverse effects observed. However, in a subsequent double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study, the monotherapy with 21 failed to yield significant viral load reduction in genotype 1 HCV\u2010infected patients. The underlying reason is attributed to a relatively low trough concentration (0.47 \u03bcM) at a dosage of 600 mg (BID), which is lower than the IC50 value (1.5 \u03bcM) of 21 against HCV in the presence of serum, and the dosage elevation did not result in proportional exposure.\n50\n Therefore, the clinical trial with 21 is not continued.",

In 2016, a new family of nonpeptide based small\u2010molecule Cyps inhibitors have been designed using fragment\u2010based strategy.\n59\n The crystal structure of CypA indicated that its PPIase catalytic site consisted of hydrophobic, aromatic, and polar residues, next to the catalytic site is a deep pocket called gatekeeper site, which might contribute to the substrate binding specificity (Figure 7). A total of 34 409 fragments were docked into these two sites, and several fragments were identified to bind to these two sites separately. Eventually, fragment 28 and 29 from each binding site were selected and connected together by a urea linkage to yield compound 30 (Figure 8), which showed potent inhibitory effect against CypA and B with IC50 values of 13 and 6 \u03bcM, respectively.

Meanwhile, the host has also evolved an innate immune system to counteract viral infections. Compounds with the capacity to mediate the host antiviral pathways are expected to confer broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity, and nitazoxanide (32; Figure 9) is such a compound that regulates several host antiviral pathways to convey broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles. 32 is originally an FDA approved drug for the treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis in both adults and children, and it has been demonstrated to be well\u2010tolerated in humans with the gastrointestinal disorders as the most frequently observed side effects. It also showed no effect on cardiac repolarization in a clinical trial for cardiac safety.\n69\n In recent studies, 32 was revealed as a promising antiviral agent against a wide range of pathogenic viruses including influenza virus,\n70\n HBV,\n71\n HCV,\n71\n EBOV,\n72\n DENV,\n73\n JEV,\n74\n HIV,\n75\n and ZIKV,\n76\n among others with IC50 values ranging from 0.06 to 1.0 \u03bcg/mL\n77\n, \n78\n Its mechanism studies revealed that multiple host antiviral pathways were involved, and as such 32 is widely known as a polypharmacology antiviral agent. 32 activated protein kinase R (PKR), which plays vital roles in innate immune system. The activation of PKR leads to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1, an important host restriction factor against viral replications.\n79\n HBV viral protein HBX was found to interact with host protein damage\u2010specific DNA\u2010binding protein 1 (DDB1) to promote transcription of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and degradation of a host restriction factor chromosomes 5/6 (Smc5/6).\n80\n\n32 was reported to disrupt the interaction between HBx and DDB1 to block the transcription from cccDNA.\n81\n In addition, 32 was also able to activate cellular antiviral response and induce the expression of a subset of IFN\u2010stimulated genes, especially interferon regulatory factor 1,\n82\n which is known to block the replication of a wide range of viruses.\n83\n Other host targeting mechanisms are also involved in the broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles of 32.\n72\n Since 32 has been safely used in clinic for many years, it has been advanced into clinical trials for the treatment of several viral infections. The most advanced one is the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza with 32. In a phase 2b/3 trial, significant reductions in TCI50 viral titer and alleviation in symptoms were observed in 32 (600 mg, twice daily) group as compared to the placebo. No resistance was identified in the influenza virus collected from the patients receiving 32, and no adverse effect on humoral immune response was reported.\n84\n A large global phase 3 trial is being conducted. Several clinical trials of 32 for the treatment of other viral infections are also ongoing. In a pilot clinical trial of 32 for the treatment of chronic HBV, the serum HBV DNA of eight of nine patients became undetectable after 4 to 20 weeks of treatment with 32, and more importantly, three out of nine subjects became HBeAg negative, which is a rare outcome for current standard of care. This proof\u2010of\u2010concept study presented 32 as a very promising drug to achieve a HBV cure.\n85\n\n32 was also tested in clinical trials against HCV infections, and it showed very pronounced efficacy either as monotherapy or in combination with IFN\u2010\u03b1 and RBV. For example, administration of 500 mg 32 twice a day for 48 weeks with 180 \u03bcg of IFN\u2010\u03b1 once weekly from week 13 to 48 achieved a SVR of 79% in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4, as compared to 50% for IFN\u2010\u03b1 and RBV. However, the development of 32 as an anti\u2010HCV drug was not further pursued due to the approval of several new DAAs, despite that 32 has much higher genetic barrier to resistance as compared to DAAs.",

To obtain new candidate compounds with improved potency and safety profiles, structural modifications were made to 32 primarily on the phenyl ring A and the thiazole moiety. It was revealed that electron\u2010withdrawing group such as nitro and chloro group at C\u20105 position was favorable for the antiviral activity, and replacement of the thiazole ring with phenyl ring retained the activity. The structural optimization led to the identification of a candidate compound RM\u20105038 (34) with a chloro group at the C\u20105 position, which showed comparable activity to that of 32 with EC50 values in the submicromolar range. 34 was considered to be superior as compared to 32 due to the replacement of the potential cytotoxicity nitro group in 32. 32 also suffers from poor systemic exposure after oral administration, and it is primarily biodistributed in the gastric intestinal tract, and excreted via urine and faeces. For antiviral therapy, it is preferred to increase the systemic exposure of the active drug.

To address these limitations, further structural modifications were made to 36 by introducing various substituted alkyl sidechain, and several analogues were identified as potent antiviral activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), tacaribe virus, and DENV with EC50 values in the submicromolar range, which is hundreds fold more potent than 38. In addition, these compounds showed much superior PK profiles, especially compound 42, which had an oral bioavailability of 94%.

To avoid such side effects, a prodrug of compound 42 was designed by masking the free hydroxyl group by acylation. The tetrabutyrate prodrug 43 exhibited preferred stability toward simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, and yet was readily converted to the parent drug in the plasma and liver of mice.

Therefore, IMPDH inhibitors are expected to show broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. Indeed, IMPDH inhibitors exhibited broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities against both DNA and RNA virus in vitro.\n100\n The approved non\u2010nucleoside\u2010based IMPDH inhibitors include mycophenolic acid (44), its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (45) and mizoribine (46; Figure 11), and all of them were approved for prevention of organ transplant rejection, but not for antiviral therapy, Nevertheless, all these inhibitors were reported to inhibit the replication of a wide range of virus in vitro and even in vivo. For example, 44, an uncompetitive IMPDH inhibitor with respect to IMP and NAD+, is active against flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthopoxviruses, avian reoviruses, and DENVs with EC50 values in low micromolar range, and its antiviral potency is closely correlated to the intracellular GTP levels, indicating the involvement of IMPDH inhibition in its antiviral mechanism.\n101\n, \n102\n However, one major limitation with the application of 44 is the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group, which is prone to glycosylation for excretion, and thereby limits its efficacy. To overcome this limitation, a series of phenyloxazoles were developed by the Vertex group and others. The representative compound from this series is VX\u2010497 (47), which shows high affinity to IMPDH with a K\ni value of 10 nM. It shows potent antiviral activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA virus including HBV, HCMV, RSV, and murine encephalomyocarditis virus, HCV, ZIKV, and EBOV,\n103\n among others with IC50 values ranging from low micromolar to submicromolar levels, and its antiviral activity can be reversed by the addition of guanosine, indicating that its antiviral mechanism is resulted from IMPDH inhibition.

Although 47 is a very selective IMPDH inhibitor with potent anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro, it did not achieve similar magnitude of antiviral efficacy in patients. It is speculated that the level and supply of nucleotides varies in vitro and in vivo, and hence the dependence of viral replication on the de novo synthesis of nucleotides may be significantly different between in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is expected that IMPDH inhibitors can only show limited efficacy in vivo, albeit with potent antiviral activities in vitro. One may argue that the success of RBV in the treatment of HCV has established IMPDH as a viable antiviral target. It should be noted that RBV is only a weak IMPDH inhibitor with a K\ni value of around 250 nM, and it is widely accepted that other mechanisms are involved in the antiviral action of RBV. In addition, RBV has to be used in combination with IFN\u2010alpha or other anti\u2010HCV agents in clinic, and the monotherapy with RBV failed to yield any antiviral efficacy in patients.\n108\n Although quite a few other IMPDH inhibitors are under development, they are all intended for other indications. Consequently, special attentions should be paid to this issue in pursuit of IMPDH inhibitors as antiviral agents.",

Host kinases adaptor protein 2 (AP2)\u2010associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G\u2010associated kinase (GAK), two kinases from this family, are found to regulate intracellular trafficking of a variety of viruses including DENV and EBOV. Two approved kinase inhibitors sunitinib (49) and erlotinib (50) were found to potently inhibit AAK1 and GAK, respectively, and both are reported to exhibit potent broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity in vitro. In addition, the combination of 49 and 50 showed very pronounced protective effects against morbidity and mortality in DENV and EBOV infection mouse models.\n112\n A cocktail treatment containing 49 and 50 against EBOV infection is being investigated in clinic trial, but no clinical data have been disclosed yet (NCT02380625). GAK and AAK1 were also reported to regulate the binding of AP2M1 to HCV core protein, which is essential to the HCV assembly. Inhibitors of GAK and AAK1 disrupted the interaction between AP2M1 and core, and thus inhibited HCV replication with EC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 1.8 \u03bcM.\n113\n Although 49 and 50 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against GAK and AAK1, both of which are known as pan\u2010kinase inhibitors, and thus raise off\u2010target toxicity concerns when used as antiviral agents. In 2015, Herdewijn et al developed a series of highly selective inhibitors against GAK. The crystal structure of GAK in complex with one of these inhibitors has been resolved, showing that inhibitors as such behaved as classic type I adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\u2010competitive kinase inhibitors. These compounds showed pronounced anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro with EC50 in the low micromolar range.\n114\n Further structure optimization lead to the identification of compound 51 with a K\nd value of 8.9 nM, which is endowed with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of viruses including DENV, EBOV, CHIKV with EC50 values in the low micromolar range.

For example, DENV developed resistance against the viral NS4B inhibitor SDM25N after eight passages, yet it remained sensitive to the treatment of 49 and 50 under the same conditions.\n119\n Despite with advantages of broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles and higher genetic barrier to resistance, there still remain concerns or limitations for repurposing kinase inhibitors as antiviral agents. Chiefly, toxicity is the major concern associated with kinase inhibitor, because most of kinases (if not all) play essential roles to regulate the cellular functions. However, it should be noted that, in most cases, the duration of antiviral therapy can be as short as several weeks or even several days, and hence the incidence of severe side effects can be significantly decreased. In addition, the potential toxicity can be further diminished by operating in a well\u2010defined therapeutic window. Since most of the kinase inhibitors are designed to target the ATP binding site, which is highly conserved among different kinase families, so nearly all kinase inhibitors possess cross inhibitory activity against other kinases, which could be problematic. First, targeting multiple kinase may result in off\u2010target side effects; second, it is challenging to understand the mechanism underlying the antiviral action of these inhibitors because multiple kinases are involved. However, one could also argue that pan\u2010kinase inhibition is favorable for antiviral therapy in that the off\u2010target kinase(s) may also contribute to the viral replication, and targeting multiple kinases simultaneously may result in not only synergetic antiviral activity but also high genetic barrier to resistance as well. Altogether, targeting kinases represent a promising strategy for the development of antiviral agents, especially the ones with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles and high genetic barrier to resistance.",

There are four HSP90 isoforms, namely HSP90\u03b1, HSP90\u03b2, TRAP1, and GRP94, each of which has distinct subcellular distribution and functions. Recently, mounting evidence demonstrate that HSP90 is highly involved in all life cycles of various viral replications. It plays vital roles at different viral replication step by interacting with different viral proteins. At the viral entry and intracellular trafficking stage, HSP90 is reported to be critical for the intracellular translocation of viral proteins as well as other host factors critical for viral replications. For example, HSP90 is required for the nuclear translocation of EBV and HSV\u20101 DNA polymerase and\n139\n, \n140\n RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase of influenza virus.\n141\n To facilitate viral gene expression, HSP90 also activate several host signaling pathways. For instance, HSP90 is upregulated to activate Akt and nuclear factor \u03baB for viral gene expression upon HCMV infection.\n142\n As a chaperone protein, HSP90 is indispensable for the maturation, accurate folding, and maintenance of stability of various proteins including viral proteins. For example, HSP90 facilitates the accurate folding of NS5A of HCV virus in the replication complex to promote viral replication.\n143\n It can also help to maintain the stability of various viral proteins, including polymerases of VSV,\n144\n CHIKV,\n145\n and RSV,\n146\n and ribonucleoprotein complex\n147\n to facilitate viral genome replications. In addition, HSP90 is also involved in the formation of viral capsid. Hsp90 can maintain the stability of capsid precursor P1 protein of poliovirus,\n147\n and it can also increase affinity between core protein dimers to facilitate HBV capsid formation.\n148\n In summary, HSP90 plays indispensable roles at almost all life cycles of various virus. Therefore, it can be anticipated that HSP90 inhibitors would present broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. Currently, there are up to 17 HSP90 inhibitors in clinical trials for cancer treatment, and most of them are N\u2010terminal ATP binding domain inhibitors.\n149\n This type of inhibitors competitively bind to the ATP binding site, and subsequently abolish the hydrolysis of ATP and HSP90's functions. Shown in Figure 9 are some representative HSP90 inhibitors, and the most famous one among this series is geldanamycin (GA; 63; Figure 16). 63 was first isolated from a fermentation broth of Streptomyces hygroscopicus in 1970, and was identified as the first HSP90 inhibitor binding to the N\u2010terminal ATP binding pocket. It was initially evaluated as an anticancer agent due to the important roles of HSP90 in multiple cancers. Because HSP90 also plays indispensable roles at different life cycle of viral replications, 63 was reported to exhibit antiviral activities against a wide range of viral infections, including HSV\u20102,\n150\n HSV\u20101,\n151\n HCMV,\n142\n EBOV,\n152\n HIV\u20101,\n153\n and influenza virus,\n154\n among others. However, since 63 possesses several inherent limitations, such as poor water solubility and severe hepatotoxicity, structural modifications to 63 have been carried out. The modification was primarily made at the C\u201017 position by replacing the methoxyl group with various substituted amines, such as 17\u2010AAG (64) and 17\u2010DMAG (65). These two analogues showed improved PK profiles, especially 65, which presented much better water solubility, stability, bioavailability, and safety. Both compounds have entered clinical trials for cancer treatment, but neither of them has made it to market for unknown reasons. 64 was shown to inhibit RSV replication in an in vivo model of well\u2010differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells at concentration as low as 1.9 nM. Moreover, despite extensive replication in the presence of 64, no resistance against 64 was observed even after 17 passages, which is in direct contrast to previously reported RSV inhibitor.\n155\n Similarly, 63 was reported to inhibit the replication of poliovirus both in vitro and in vivo, and no resistance against 63 was detected after 10 passages, despite that poliovirus is feature with rapid replication rate and high mutation frequency.\n156\n These results showcased the advantages of HTAs over DAAs in regard to drug resistance.",

Most of the HSP90 inhibitors in clinical trials are accompanied with some severe side effects including cardiotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and/or ocular toxicity amongst other side effects.\n162\n, \n163\n, \n164\n It is now widely accepted that these unwanted toxicities are mainly attributed to pan\u2010inhibition of HSP90 isoforms. For example, the observed cardiotoxicity mainly resulted from the inhibition HSP90\u03b1, which is responsible for the maturation of hERG channel.\n165\n Therefore, HSP90 isoform\u2010selective inhibitors are expected to side\u2010step some detrimental toxicity observed with pan\u2010inhibitors. Indeed, several HSP90 isoform\u2010selective inhibitors against Grp94\n166\n, \n167\n (72\u201073) and HSP90\u03b2\n168\n (71) have been successfully developed with much better safety profiles. These inhibitors were devised for cancer treatment, and their antiviral profiles were not investigated. Very recently, two GRP94 selective inhibitors 72 and 73 were found to inhibit the replication of DENV and ZIKV with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range, and it was further confirmed that GRP94 was essential for the replication of DENV and ZIKV.\n169\n Therefore, it can be deduced that GRP94 might be indispensable for the replications of other viruses as well. It can be envisioned that antiviral therapy with HSP90 inhibitors can benefit from HSP90 isoform inhibition, and isoform\u2010selective HSp90 inhibitors could be a new strategy for the development of broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents.",

            "text": "HSP70 is a family of chaperones with diverse cellular functions including protein folding, protein transportation, breakdown of unstable proteins, and removal of protein complexes. There are generally two types of HSP70 protein, namely the inducible (ie, HSP70i) and the constitutive (Hsc70) isoforms, both of which are shown to play an integral role in viral replications. For example, HSP70 is indispensable for the folding of several viral proteins, including HCV NS5A,\n170\n the L and envelop protein of HBV,\n171\n G protein of VSV,\n172\n the envelop protein of HIV,\n173\n among others. Similarly, Hsc70 is also required for the replication of a wide range of viruses, such as influenza virus,\n174\n rotavirus,\n175\n polyomavirus,\n176\n HCV,\n177\n among others. Consequently, HSP70 inhibitors are expected to show broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. As compared to HSP90 inhibitors, Hsp70 inhibitors are under developed, and the development of Hsp70 inhibitors is faced with several challenges: HSP70 has a high affinity toward ADP, and the conformation state of HSP70 makes the ATP binding site less accessible.\n178\n Therefore, it is very hard to design inhibitors targeting the ATP binding site.\n179\n Due to high sequence similarity between HSP70i and Hsc70, most of the available inhibitors are unable to discriminate between those two isoforms. Shown in Figure 10 are a selected subset of HSP70 inhibitors, and all those inhibitors are intended for cancer indication. MKT\u2010077 (76; Figure 17) is the most advanced one, which has entered phase I clinical trial for cancer treatment. However, its clinical trial was halted due to severe renal dysfunction observed in patients.\n180\n, \n181\n\n76 inhibits HSP70 by disrupting its interaction with nucleotide exchange factors, which promote the release of Hsp70\u2010bound substrates. 76 along with its analogue JG\u201018 (77) and JG\u201040 (80) were reported to inhibit the propagation of DENV, and no toxicity toward the host cells was observed at concentrations inhibiting viral replication. Interestingly, the other two structural analog JG\u201019 (78) and JG\u201028 (79) did not inhibit viral propagation at the same concentration (1 \u03bcM), albeit with highly structural similarity toward 80.\n182\n In addition, 80 suppressed the inflammation response associated with dengue fever. More importantly, no resistance to 80 was detected even after 10 passages, while significant resistance was observed with a viral NS5 inhibitor under the same conditions, highlighting the advantages of HTAs over DAAs in terms of resistance selection. 80 and its analogues have also exhibited broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles with inhibitory activity against HCV,\n183\n ZIKV,\n184\n West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses.\n182\n The HSP70i is at relatively low level in unstressed cell, while its expression is significantly induced upon viral infections, indicating an integral role of HSP70i in viral infections. To achieve HSP70 isoform inhibition, several inhibitors targeting an allosteric site on HSP70 were elegantly designed with selectivity toward Hsp70i.\n185\n, \n186\n HS\u201072 (81) is one of such inhibitors, and it was shown to inhibit the entry of DENV mainly by disrupting the association of Hsp70i with the DENV receptor complex.\n187\n In comparison, Hsc70 selective inhibitors have not been precedented. However, in contrast to direct inhibition, Hsc70 downregulators have been reported with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. For example, IMB\u2010DM122 (82), an analogue derived from natural compound oxymatrine, was discovered as a Hsc70 downregulator. The half\u2010life of Hsc70 messenger RNA (mRNA) was reduced by 78% followed by the treatment of 82 (500 \u03bcg/mL) in Huh7.5 cells. As such, 82 is effective to inhibit HCV replication at a concentration of 125 \u03bcg/mL. In addition, 82 is well\u2010tolerated in mice with no obvious toxicity at a single dosage of 1000 mg/kg (intraperitoneal [IP]).\n188\n Intensive structural modifications were further made to the sidechain and/or substituent at the nitrogen position of 82, yielding several analogues with IC50s against HCV in the low micromolar range (ie, 83).\n189\n, \n190\n, \n191\n The oxymatrine analogues were also shown to inhibit both wild\u2010type and lamivudine\u2010resistant HBV infection via downregulating Hsc70 expression with excellent safety profile in mice (LD50 = 750 mg/kg, oral administration).\n192\n The activity against other virus was also reported with oxymatrine analogues.\n193\n, \n194\n The other naturally occurring Hsc70 downregulator is lycorine (84).\n121\n It was reported to decrease the Hsc70 mRNA level does\u2010dependently with definitive anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro. The structural optimization led to several derivatives with IC50 values ranging from low micromolar to submicromolar levels. The SAR study showed that the double bond between C3 and C4 and the basic nitrogen at N\u20105 position are crucial to the anti\u2010HCV activity.\n195\n Interestingly, its naturally occurring cousin lycoricidine (85) possessed much more potent inhibitory effect against HCV with an EC50 value of 0.55 nM, and the mechanism of action studies revealed that downregulation of Hsc70 expression at least partially account for the observed antiviral activity.\n196\n Although these compounds are confirmed to downregulate Hsc70 to exert their antiviral efficacy, their respective physical binding protein(s) remain to be clarified, but it can be deduced that their physical binding partner(s) must be host factor(s).",

In addition, a series of intracellular restriction factors are also expressed endogenously to counteract viral infections,\n197\n and apolipoprotein B mRNA\u2010editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide\u2010like 3G (APOBEC3G, A3G) is one such factor, which possesses the capacity to restrict the replication of a panel of viruses including HIV\u20101, HBV, HCV, and EV71 among others via different mechanisms. A3G is known as a cytidine deaminase, catalyzing the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of cytidine and deoxycytidine to uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. Its anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity is closely associated with its deaminase function, by which consistent mutation from dG to dA in the positive strand of viral DNA is frequently observed.\n198\n The high level of G to A mutation is attributed to the C to U transitions occurred on the complementary negative\u2010strand DNA by the cytidine deaminase activity of A3G. Introduction of deoxyuracils in the proviral DNA can ultimately lead to its cleavage and degradation by specific AP endonucleases. Additionally, high percentages of G to A mutation in the HIV\u20101 genome will result in the loss of functions of viral proteins.\n199\n Interestingly, the antiviral activity of A3G against other virus is independent of its deaminase activity. For example, A3G is reported to inhibit HCV replications by binding to the C\u2010terminus of HCV NS3 protein to reduce its helicase activity, which is essential for HCV replication.\n200\n, \n201\n A3G was also reported to inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo, but its anti\u2010HBV mechanism is not related to its deaminase activity, because A3G did not yield any G to A hypermutation within the HBV genome, and the catalytically inactive A3G derivatives were able to result in the same magnitude of HBV inhibition as compared with its wild\u2010type counterpart.\n202\n, \n203\n\n",

For example, HIV\u20101 expresses a viral protein Vif, which binds to A3G and form an ubiquitin ligase complex with cullin 5 (CUL5), elongin B/C (ELOB/C), and CBF\u03b2, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of A3G.\n204\n In the cases of HBV and HCV infections, endogenous A3G is also eliminated by some unknown mechanisms. Therefore, agents either disrupting the formation of ubiquitin complex, stabilizing A3G or inducing the expression of A3G are expected to demonstrate antiviral activity. In 2008, Chen et al identified two compounds IMB\u201026 (86; Figure 18) and IMB\u201035 (87), which directly binds to A3G and disrupted its interaction with Vif, and therefore rescue A3G from Vif\u2010mediated degradation. Both compounds showed A3G\u2010dependent anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity in nonpermissive H9 cells with EC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Moreover, no cytotoxicity was observed at a concentration of around 4 \u03bcM, indicating a therapeutic index of greater than 200, and the LD50 value for 87 is as high as greater than 1000 mg/kg (IP).\n205\n\n86 also showed strong antiviral activity against HCV in vitro via stabilizing intracellular A3G.\n206\n Due to the presence of a bromo substituent at the \u03b1 position of amide, which is highly reactive as a alkylation agent, structural modifications were made to 86, and it turned out that the bromo is not essential for the antiviral activities. Most of the synthesized derivatives showed potent antiviral activity against HCV and EV71 virus with IC50 values ranging from 0.57 to 80 \u03bcM.\n207\n, \n208\n Since the amide linkage is liable to hydrolysis, a methylene group was inserted between the carbonyl and amino group. However, such modification resulted in complete loss of activity.\n207\n To further address this issue, a ring formation strategy was employed to generate compound with 2\u2010aryl\u2010isoindolin\u20101\u2010ones scaffold (88). These analogues showed much\u2010enhanced stability toward hydrolysis, and most importantly, the anti\u2010EV71 activity was retained with IC50 in the low micromolar range.\n209\n Interestingly, the derivatives of 86 also showed definitive antiviral activity against both wild\u2010type and Tamiflu resistant influenza virus in vitro with IC50 values in the low micromolar range,\n210\n despite the fact that A3G does not yield any inhibitory activity against influenza virus replication,\n211\n indicating that other A3G\u2010independent antiviral mechanism must be involved.",

Since the target of the BST\u20102 is not encoded by viral genome, so the virus cannot mutate the viral protein to evade the antiviral activity of BST\u20102. However, viruses have evolved other mechanisms to counteract the action of BST\u20102 by expressing different viral proteins to physically bind to BST\u20102, and thereby block the interaction between BST\u20102 and its target. Such proteins include HIV\u20101 Vpu, HIV\u20102 Env, SIV Env, SIV Nef, KSHV K5, and the EBOV glycoprotein. For example, HIV\u20101 Vpu, a type I integral membrane protein, can either induce the ubiquitination of BST\u20102 for degradation or downregulate the cell\u2010surface BST\u20102 level by sequestering the de novo synthesized BST\u20102 away from the plasma membrane to counteract its antiviral activity.\n226\n Therefore, it can be envisioned that disruption of the interaction between BST\u20102 and these viral proteins or stabilization of BST\u20102 could yield antiviral agents. Zhang et al\n227\n developed a cell\u2010based high\u2010throughput enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay for the quantification of cell\u2010surface BST\u20102 levels,\n227\n and a lead compound IMB\u2010LA (95; Figure 19) was identified to inhibit Vpu\u2010mediated BST\u20102 degradation and recover the expression of BST\u20102 at the cell surface.\n228\n This compound inhibited both the HIV infection and release in a BST\u20102 dependent fashion.

Compound 96 showed a BST\u20102 dependent anti\u2010HIV activity with IC50 values being 0.22 and 4.42 \u03bcM in BST\u20102 positive and negative cells, respectively.\n229\n The mechanism study revealed that compound 96 did not disrupt the interaction between Vpu and BST\u20102, but inhibited Vpu mediated ubiquitination of BST\u20102.",

Although kinases have been proposed as viable targets for broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents development, targeting DDX\u20103 and multiple kinases simultaneously may lead to some unwanted adverse effects. To side\u2010step this limitation, other inhibitors were designed to target the RNA binding site of DDX\u20103. In 2012, Botta et al discovered the first inhibitor (97 and 98; Figure 20) targeting the RNA binding site of DDX\u20103. Further structural modification led to the identification of more potent inhibitors with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Such inhibitors were able to block both the helicase and ATPase activity of DDX\u20103, and thereby inhibited viral replication in HIV\u20101 infected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cells with an EC50 value of 10 \u03bcM.\n241\n In a follow\u2010up study, the structure\u2010based drug design strategy was employed to devise new inhibitors with more potent activity.

The preliminary in vivo studies in rats indicated a good safety profile with no obvious side effects and acceptable PK profiles with a half\u2010life of around 3 hours for compound 99. Altogether, DDX\u20103 is a very promising target for broad\u2010spectrum antiviral drug development, and compound 99 represents a good start point for further in\u2010depth investigation.",

            "text": "Enveloped RNA virus such as filoviruses and rhabdoviruses are highly pathogenic. These viruses express various matrix proteins to facilitate virus assembly and egress. Although these viruses will express different types of matrix proteins, they all share one common motif referred as Late (l) budding domain consisting of core consensus amino acid motifs such as PPxY, YxxL, P(T/S)AP, or FPIV (where x could be any amino acid). It has been confirmed that the L domain interacts with host protein to facilitate viral egress and spread. For example, the PPxY motif within the matrix proteins of various RNA virus formed a complex with the WW domain of E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4 (Nedd4) for efficient virus egress. Therefore, the PPxY\u2010Nedd4 interaction is a feasible target for broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents. In 2014, Harty et al identified several small\u2010molecule inhibitors of PPxY\u2010Nedd4 interaction by combining virtual screening and biologic assay. The initial hit compound 100 (Figure 21) was able to dose\u2010dependently block the PPxy\u2010dependent budding of Marv vp40 virus\u2010like particles. Further structural modification lead to the identification of lead compound 101 and 102, which showed much more potent antibudding against filoviruses, arenavirus, and rhabdovirus VLPs. For example, both compounds inhibited egress of LFV\u2010Z VLPs by more than 10\u2010fold at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM, and as expected, showed no inhibitory activity against a PPxY mutant and budding defective virus, confirming the antibudding mechanism via inhibition of PPxY and Nedd4 interaction. In addition, no cytotoxicity toward HEK293T cells was observed for both compounds at concentrations tested (1 \u03bcM).\n242\n In a follow\u2010up study, an intensive structural modifications were made to the lead compound 102, and several more potent analogues were identified with nanomolar activity in the antibudding assay. For example, compound 103 can achieve more than 90% inhibition of budding of mVP40 VLPs at 10\u2010fold lower concentration (100 nM) as compared to the lead compound 102, and 30 nM of compound 104 can also lead to 3\u2010 and 15\u2010fold of decrease in mVP40 VLP budding. Importantly, compounds 103 and 104 were able to block the budding of a recombinant virus M40\u2010VSV (EBOV surrogate) from the HEK293T cells.\n243\n Of note, it still remains unclear which protein (the viral matrix protein or Nedd4) is the physical binding partner of this type of compounds. The antiviral activity of these compounds against live virus has not been tested. Nevertheless, the PPxY\u2010Nedd4 interaction represents a promising target for the development of broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents.",

The mechanism of action study demonstrated that 105 and its derivatives showed no inhibitory effect against HCV viral proteins, and yet led to the downregulation of a host target chondroitin sulfate N\u2010acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAcT\u20101), which is a key enzyme responsible for the initiation of chondroitin sulfate chain. CSGalNAcT\u20101 was shown to play a key role during the replication of HCV virus, and its expression was elevated upon HCV infection. Knockdown of CSGalNAcT\u20101 by siRNA led to significant suppression of HCV replications. It is interesting to note that 105 showed no effect on the mRNA level of CSGalNAcT\u20101, and the downregulation of CSGalNAcT\u20101 protein level was recovered by a general protease inhibitor MG132, indicating that cajanine promoted the degradation of CSGalNAcT\u20101 by proteasome pathway. In consistency with such host targeting mechanism, 105 showed the same magnitude of inhibitory effect against both wild\u2010type and drug resistant HCV virus strains, and it also showed very pronounced synergistic effects with other DAAs to inhibit HCV replications, indicating that 105 and its derivatives are worthy of further studies. Although it is still unclear whether CSGalNAcT\u20101 is broadly required for the replication of other viruses, our unpublished data showed that 105 and its derivatives also possessed inhibitory effect against other virus such as influenza virus, HIV\u20101, HBV, and coxsackie B virus. Although it is ascertained solidly that 105 inhibits HCV replication via downregulation of CSGalNAcT\u20101 protein, it remains unclear how 105 leads to the CSGalNAcT\u20101 degradation, and which protein(s) 105 binds to physically. Answering these types of questions would definitely provide new host targets for the development of new antiviral agents.",

The inhibitors against P\u2010glycoprotein, calmodulin and protein kinase C failed to inhibit HCV replication, excluding the possibility of these proteins as the anti\u2010HCV targets for 108. A specific siRNA against ER\u03b1 significantly suppressed HCV RNA in replicon\u2010containing cells, and transient transfection with ER\u03b1 (but not ER\u03b2) expression plasmids also augmented HCV replications. Altogether, these results confirmed the important roles ER\u03b1 played during HCV replication. The subsequent binding assay showed that domain C of ER\u03b1 physically bound to NS5B but not NS3, NS4B, and NS5A, and such interaction is essential for the HCV genome replications.

It is reasonable to anticipate that such host proteins can also be targeted by small\u2010molecule modulators to convey antiviral activity.

However, DAAs also suffer from several inherent limitations due to its viral protein targeting nature: viral proteins varied among different species and even different genotypes, and thus DAA targeting one specific viral protein is unlikely to exhibit inhibitory effect against viral proteins from other viral species or variants. Therefore, DAAs are normally narrow\u2010spectrum antiviral agents, and this is also the underlying reason for the lack of effective antiviral drugs against newly emerging viruses; the other major downside for DAAs is they are prone to cause drug resistance, particular among RNA viruses with very high frequency of replication errors. HTA agents perfectly complement to DAAs in regard to narrow\u2010spectrum activity and drug resistance. Since host factors are probably broadly required for viral replications, HTAs are very likely to show broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles. HTAs also have much higher genetic barrier to resistance as compare to DAAs in that host factors are not under the genetic control of virus. The expected selected mutations are not in the host genome, and should be selected in the viral protein that interacts with the host target. Consequently, HTAs are highly expected to address the problem of drug resistance and provide solution to the treatment of newly emerging viruses.",

            "text": "Although a large number of host factors are known to play vital roles throughout the whole life cycle of virus, only very few of them were explored as antiviral targets. This is primarily attributed to several concerns raised by HTAs. Chiefly, targeting a host protein may potentially lead to unwanted toxicity issues, because the target protein may be indispensable for some cellular functions. However, this may not be intrinsically true for all the host proteins, and many host genes are known to be nonessential for cellular functions. Therefore, the inhibition of such host proteins will be well\u2010tolerated, and the on\u2010target based toxicity can be minimized. Even though the target host protein is essential for some cellular functions, the on\u2010target based toxicity can be mitigated in many ways. First, it is known that the expression level or the activity of many cellular proteins are elevated to facilitate viral replications. Therefore, it is possible to knockdown the target protein to a level, at which the viral replication can be blocked while the normal cellular functions can still be maintained. Second, most of the time, alternative pathways or proteins exist for a cellular function, and hence the inhibition of one of these proteins or pathways may lead to the blockage of viral replication, but not the cellular function. Third, the on\u2010target based toxicity is closely associated with the duration of treatment, and the treatment of most of viral infections only lasts for several weeks or even days. Therefore, the toxicity concern raised by targeting a host factor for virus treatment can be further alleviated. It is worth noting that quite a few approved drugs targeting host factors for other indications are considered to be generally safe to use in clinic for years. Consequently, toxicity issue is something that one should pay attention to, but not something used to bias against host target antiviral agents.",

The other example is the repurposement of statins as anti\u2010HCV drugs. Statins showed very pronounced inhibitory effects against HCV replication in vitro, but yield unsatisfactory outcomes in clinic trials. The lack of reliable predictive in vitro models indeed increased the attrition rates in the development of HTAs. However, despite with these challenges, development of HTAs can be highly rewarding because HTAs can potentially address the unmet needs in the treatment of viral infections.",
