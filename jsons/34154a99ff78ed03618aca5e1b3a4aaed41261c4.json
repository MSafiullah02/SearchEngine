Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important diamino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies.",

Previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of CoVs (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) which can infect the human species. HCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E belongs to alphaCoV genus while rest belongs to betaCoV genus. (Tang et al., 2015) . The betaCoVs appears to be prima-facie genre of CoVs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades. Recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreak spread from China to the intercontinental arena and already infected 0.3 million people globally claiming ~13000 (~4.3%) deaths till 21 st March 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). China and Italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future. Genome sequence analysis of SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV confirmed its presence in betaCoVs family and divergence from the other two viruses (Zhu et al., 2020) . The 2019-nCoV is a positivestrand RNA viruses with ~29 Kb genome size, 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2019) . Viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and 3-5 nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genome starts with short untranslated regions (5' UTR) followed by genes 5\u2032-replicase (rep gene), S, E, M, N and 3' UTR (Song et al., 2019) . Two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5' end which encodes for non-structural protein (Nsp). Spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre (Du et al., 2009 (Du et al., , 2017 . Viral assembly relies primarily on M and E proteins and RNA synthesis is achieved by action of N protein (Song et al., 2019) .",

Further a phylogenetic analysis between these viruses displayed that hCoVs are closer to bat/SARS-like virus (MG772933.1) and distant from SARS coronavirus (KY352407.1) and bat coronavirus (GU190215.1) (Figure 1 ). These results demonstrate that SARS coronavirus and bat coronavirus (GU190215.1) could be apparent ancestor of other coronaviruses studied in the investigation. Scrutiny of nucleotide and amino acid in coding region of the genome revealed that the hCoV genome share 92.67% and 96.92% similarity at nucleotide level with pangolins and bat hCoV genome, whereas the similarity level increased up to 97.82% and 98.67% at amino acid level (Table 2 ). This indicates that most substitutions taking place were of synonymous type. Among various protein coding genes Nsp4-10, Nsp12-14, Nsp16, M, E and ORF6 shared highly conserve amino acid composition between bat-hCoV and hCoV with >99% similarity, especially Nsp7-10, Nsp16, E and ORF6 share 100% amino acid similarity ( Table 2 ). The 100% similarity in these regions across 591 hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV mark them to be a probable target region for future antibodies and vaccine therapy.

The phylogram was majorly divided into 5 groups based on their clade division. Bat and pangolin-hCoV were categorized in the group I and all other hCoVs were categorized in group II to V ( Figure 2 ). Group II comprises of the human 2019-nCoV mainly belonging to different province of China. However, few exceptions were also from South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Chile, USA, India, Belgium, Spain, Germany and France hCoVs. Group III mainly comprised of the hCoVs belonging to USA while Group IV represented the hCoVs of mixed type population belonging to several countries distributed over continents. Group V possess the hCoV from European countries along with few hCoVs of America and one from Taiwan. To understand mystery underlying the clustering pattern of the hCoVs, bat and pangolin-hCoV were used as a reference sequence to observe the nucleotide substitution in hCoV members in different groups. Interestingly, hCoV members (Group II and Group III) falling in proximity to Group I have less substitution in the genome sequences (Table   S2 ). The T:C (GroupV-hCoV:bat-hCoV and GroupV-hCoV:pangolin-hCoV) substitution were frequent in Group V as compared to hCoV representing other groups (Table S2 ) . The genomic signature of USA-hCoVs present in Group V is very different from USA-hCoVs of Group III.",

The nucleotide substitution in hCoV genomes were predominantly of transition type with ~45% being C:T ( Figure 3A) . A detailed investigation of the nucleotide substitution in the coding region of hCoVs genome with perspective of encoded amino acids revealed 43 synonymous and 57 non-synonymous substitutions ( Table S3 ). The proteins Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp7-10, Nsp14-16, ORF4, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 mainly possessed synonymous substitutions and hence were mostly devoid of amino acid changes ( Figure 3B ). The 57 amino acid changes were distributed over 12 regions in the ~30kb genome. The number of amino acids substitutions varied between different regions such as 7 in Nsp2, 10 in Nsp3, 5 in Nsp4, 3 in Nsp6, 1 in Nsp12, 4 in Nsp13, 11 in Spike, 3 in ORF3a, 2 in ORF5, 1 in ORF6, 2 in ORF8 and 8 in ORF9 (Figure 4) . Intriguingly, various important non-synonymous mutations were observed majorly in European and US continent while the mutations were mostly synonymous in Asian continent. These interesting observations can be used to infer the reason behind larger infectivity and pathogenicity in these regions (Table S3 ).

Spike region determines the specific binding to host receptor and initiation of viral replication. This region is reported to be the most potent and indispensable for viral attachment and entry into host system. The RRAR amino acids found only in the human CoVs spike region has proved to be essential for binding to host receptor (Walls et al., 2020) . We observed similar region in the hCoV genomes studied (23713-23724 region in nucleotide alignment), although there was mutation in two hCoV-England nucleotide sequences (CTCCGCGGCGGG in place of CTCCTCGGCGGG) but the resulting amino acid remained same in all hCoV genomes. These findings corroborate the essentiality of RRAR sequence for viral infection to host system. We found different type of mutation in hCoV spike protein at different places such as leucine to valine (L8V), glutamine to histidine (Q675H and also found in ORF3a:Q57H), glutamine to lysine (Q239K) and aspartate to glycine (D614G and also found in ORF5, D3G) might have potential role to augment viral infection (Table S3) . Previous investigations showed mutations such as leucine to valine change in retroviral envelope protein, glutamine to lysine in influenza virus, glutamine to histidine and aspartate to glycine in H1N1 had a severe impact in virus entry, replication and cross infectivity to other species (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2012; Glinsky, 2010; Yamada et al., 2010) . Additionally, mutations were present in structural proteins such as, glycine to valine mutation in ORF3a (G196V and G251V). Similar amino acid change imparts resistance against inhibitor drug saquinavir in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This might provide an explanation why drugs used for treating HIV became a failure in case of hCoV infection (Hong et al., 1997) . Notably, in ORF9 region the nucleotide sequence GGG changed to AAC in European and American continent resulting in a change of amino acid from RG to KR (AGGGGA coding for RG changed to AAACGA coding for KR, 28993-28995 in nucleotide alignment).",

An isoleucine to valine mutation (Nsp2, I559V and Nsp3, I797V) and methionine to isoleucine (Nsp4, M33I) were observed in hCoVs. Change of isoleucine to valine in polymerase subunit PB2 of influenza virus resulted in critically enhanced activity of reconstituted polymerase complex (Rolling et al., 2009 ) and M to I substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase imparted resistance to nucleoside analog 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-3\u2032thiacytidine (3TC) (Julias et al., 2004) . Interestingly, presence of a non-synonymous substitution in RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RDRP) region in majority of European hCoV samples resulted in change of amino acid from proline to leucine (P314L). It will be quite interesting to validate the effect of this substitution on RDRP activity as one of the previous study established that similar change of proline-to-leucine substitution (P236L) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, imparts resistance against a highly specific inhibitor bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) (Fan et al., 1995) .

Few mutations also resulted in change of amino acid which may provide an explanation for failure of previously employed antiviral therapies. This research will better equip the researchers to utilize the mutated amino acid information for drug targets in particular geography and less cases of failure. Beside the substitution resulting into transformation to a more virulent strain there are number of highly conserved regions in the hCoV genome which can be used as target for inhibitory drugs and vaccine development for a large repertoire of strains. Finally, we believe that our data provide useful information pertaining the changes in genomic and proteomic features which could serve as a guide to design the future antiviral therapies and diagnostics.",
