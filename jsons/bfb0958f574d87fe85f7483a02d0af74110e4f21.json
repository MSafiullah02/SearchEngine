            "text": "T he outbreak of Coronavirus disease that began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has attracted great attention from the international community. By February 24, 2020, more than 77,000 cases including 2,595 deaths have been reported in China and in 27 other countries worldwide. Because the outbreak of COVID-19 has required many healthcare workers to provide direct care to infected patients, they are at high risk of infection. Despite great efforts to control the spread of the disease and minimize human-to-human transmission, more than 3,000 healthcare workers have been infected according to reports by the Chinese Center for Disease Control as of February 12, 2020. 1 The risk of getting COVID-19 for healthcare workers is much greater than that of the general population.",

            "text": "Anesthesiologists likely have an even higher risk than healthcare workers of other subspecialties because anesthesiologists manage the airway and ventilation. This requires them to be adjacent to the airway of patients during emergency airway intubation outside the operating room, while taking care of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and while providing perioperative care for patients undergoing urgent and emergency surgeries. Several anesthesiologists have been infected after providing tracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients, although the exact number of infected anesthesiologists is yet unknown. Meanwhile, because the operating room is a busy environment, it further increases the risk of nosocomial infections of the perioperative team including anesthesiologists. Therefore, urgent development of safe medical practices and infection prevention protocols for the perioperative management of patients with COVID-19 is needed.",

This document was created based on World Health Organization 2 and National Health Commission guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, 3 clinical experiences from the most frontline care providers, [4] [5] [6] and a comprehensive review of updated literature on the perioperative management of infectious patients. [7] [8] [9] This first edition is not intended to replace any existing guidelines on anesthesia care and infectious disease control. Rather, it is aimed at providing recommendations on how to manage this specific patient population when anesthesiologists provide care either in the perioperative setting or in the management of the airway of patients outside the operating room. We hope the recommendations from the experts who have managed patients on the frontlines and who have firsthand experience can help our colleagues provide the best care to our patients, including the care of providers themselves, and prevent those who are not infected from becoming infected. We realize that there is a lack of well-designed and executed studies to support these recommendations. However, these recommendations are based on the experience of the frontline healthcare workers who have observed its effectiveness. This task force will be continuously working on and updating the following versions in a timely manner.",

However, a small fraction of patients present with nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. Severe cases often develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the first symptom.

However, the organization of the equipment drugs must be sufficient as visualization and access to the equipment and drugs are often suboptimal due to restricted space and vapor condensation on the eye shield ( fig. 3 ). (4) The team should choose the airway devices that they are most familiar with, including but not limited to: (1) a video laryngoscope with disposable blades; (2) a disposable video-optic stylet or disposable video endotracheal tube; (3) a disposable second-generation intubating laryngeal mask; (4) a kit for emergency cricothyroidotomy; (5) if available, preparation of a disposable flexible video bronchoscope; and (6) if available, preparation of supraglottic and subglottic airway compatible with the insertion of an endotracheal tube. Periodical injection of 2% lidocaine 2 to 3 ml or 1% lidocaine 4 to 6 ml through the working channel can reduce irritation and minimize the coughing of the patient. For physicians who are very familiar with the use of the video laryngoscope or fiberscope, the video laryngoscope or fiberscope is recommended because it may significantly increase the distance between the patient's airway and that of the anesthesiologist who performs intubation ( fig. 4 ). (5) A high efficiency breathing circuit filter should be installed between the mask and the breathing circuit or respiratory bag, and at the proximal end of the breathing circuit as well. However, the efficiency of the filter in blocking the virus is undetermined. Therefore, once the ICU ventilator is used for a patient confirmed with COVID-19, it should be dedicated to patients with COVID-19 only. The disinfection of the ICU ventilator for use on a patient not infected with the virus is the same as described in \"Anesthesia Equipment Care and Operating Room Disinfection.\" 6) A closed airway suction system is, if available, recommended to reduce viral aerosol production. If it is not available, the team should keep the minimal but necessary number of suctions using a nonclosed suction system.",

(4) Be aware that adequate mask seal and minute alveolar ventilation results in adequate preintubation oxygenation. If high flow oxygenation is required, the providers should be cautious as high flow oxygen increases the production of viral droplets and aerosol. The patient's mouth and nose should be covered with two layers of wet gauze, ensuring that it does not obstruct the airway. The preoxygenation mask is superimposed over the gauze. For patients already on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, preoxygenation can be achieved with 100% oxygen for 5 min without alternating the ventilatory settings. The bag-mask ventilation setting can be useful as a backup option. (5) For patients with a normal airway, modified rapid sequence induction is recommended.
