This disease constitutes a serious worldwide public health issue (Coura and Dias, 2009), that causes a chronic parasitic condition characterized by a life-long infection of the host (Martin et al., 2015). Clinically, this disease may have an acute phase that lasts for 1 to 4 months characterized by patent parasitemia, and a chronic phase with a life-long phase including a subpatent parasitemia and tissue parasitism (Dias, 1997, Rassi et al., 2010). The diagnosis of T. cruzi infection during the acute phase is carried out by the direct detection of circulating parasites. However, during the chronic phase, the diagnosis is performed by conventional serologic assays (WHO, 2002, Otani et al., 2009, Carlier and Torrico, 2003).",

However, the treatment with benzimidazole has many side effects, prolonged treatment time, and low and variable efficacy in the chronic phase of this infection, which is the most prevalent form of the disease (Urbina and Docampo, 2003, Viotti et al., 2009). Thus, the search for more effective medications with less adverse effects is one of the main focuses of many studies (Coura, 2007). In this context, the search for alternative models for the treatment and diagnosis of T. cruzi is essential, mainly because it is a disease considered neglected. Specific antibodies for immunotherapy against this parasite might be a therapeutic alternative in controlling and/or prevention infections. Immunoglobulin Y (IgY) are polyclonal antibodies obtained from egg yolk (yolk = y) of immunized chickens. Such molecules have high specificity for binding and inactivating foreign substances, such as antigenic molecules that are able to invade the body (Karlsson et al., 2004). For this reason, IgY has been used for diagnosis and therapy (Reilly et al., 1997).",

This difference might be related to the immunization protocol, since we used only 10 days of intervals. Moreover, this difference may occur due a greater immune response mounted by the chickens opposite to the antigenic epitopes of T. cruzi antigenic epitopes that may be more complex than T. evansi. In addition, regarding the ELISA results, higher optical densities were observed up to 8 weeks, coinciding with the inoculation of a greater number of trypomastigotes (2.4 \u00d7 104\n trypomastigotes/mL), which shows that the antigen concentration is closely related to the specific production of IgY.

(2005), where avian antibodies were produced by intradermal immunization of chickens with T. cruzi epimastigotes. However, the literature reports that the light chains of IgY can weight 18 kDa (Sun et al., 2001) to 21 kDa (Hatta et al., 1993), differing from our results. There are other molecular weight characterization of different IgY as the IgY anti-Staphylococcus aureus with light chain of 15\u201325 kDa and heavy chain of 55\u201370 kDa (Reddy et al., 2014), and IgY anti-Schistosoma japonicum with light and heavy chain between 25 and 68 kDa, respectively (Cai et al., 2012.), demonstrating that there is a certain variability in the molecular weight of IgY produced.",

The results of our experiment regarding IgY anti-T. cruzi indicate that this antibody could not be used in a diagnostic test, since it showed cross-reactivity with antigens of T. evansi. But on the other hand, this finding leaves the possibility that IgY could be used as immunotherapy against many trypanosomes.",
