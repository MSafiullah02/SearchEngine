            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most costly and commonly diagnosed diseases in the beef industry. The disease results in economic losses from morbidity, mortality, cost of therapy and reduced performance (Fulton, 2009; Griffin, 1997). Approximately, 75% of the morbidity and 50% of the mortality in feedlots in United States is caused by BRD (Edwards, 2010). In Canada, over 80% of the vaccines licensed for cattle are applied for control and prevention of BRD (Bowland & Shewen, 2000; Edwards, 2010). Bovine respiratory disease is considered multifactorial, involving complex interactions between the animal, the pathogens and the environment, which poses significant challenges to its prevention and control (Murray et al., 2016). It is generally proposed that management practices such as shipping may compromise the immune system, and predispose the animals to viral and bacterial infections (Mosier, 2014). Viral infection can interfere with the immune system and damage the mucociliary escalator mechanism and lung parenchyma, which in turn facilitates translocation of bacteria and establishment of infection in the lower respiratory tract (Taylor, Fulton, Lehenbauer, Step, & Confer, 2010).",

Although vaccines for these pathogens are commercially available, mass medication with antimicrobial on arrival at the feedlot (also known as metaphylaxis in North America) is still needed for effective prevention, which raises major public health concerns regarding antimicrobial usage and resistance (Bowland & Shewen, 2000; Ellis, 2009; Hilton, 2014; Timsit et al., 2017). Furthermore, despite aggressive use of antibiotics and vaccines, BRD morbidity and mortality rates among feedlot cattle have remained steady (Hilton, 2014).",

Results of another US study suggested IDV as a potential aetiologic agent for BRD after metagenomic sequencing of nasal swabs from Mexican and American steers (Mitra, Cernicchiaro, Torres, Li, & Hause, 2016). Neither of the above studies, however, included samples from the lower respiratory tract to determine whether the viruses identified in the nasal tract are representative of the entire respiratory tract virome.",

Cattle with BRD (n = 58) and control cattle (n = 58) were enrolled in this study. These cattle were from four different feedlots in Southern Alberta, Canada. Samples were collected from November 2015 to January 2016. On arrival, all cattle were vaccinated with modified live vaccines against IBR, BVDV types I and II, BPIV3 and BRSV (Pyramid FP 5 + Presponse SQ, Boehringer Ingelheim, Burlington, ON, Canada). The vaccination was repeated 30 days later. Experienced pen\u2010checkers and veterinarians observed cattle daily for signs of respiratory disease and collected the samples after the animals arrived at the feedlots. Cattle with at least one BRD sign (depression, nasal and ocular discharge, cough or dyspnea), a rectal temperature \u2265 40\u00b0C, abnormal lung sounds, a serum haptoglobin concentration \u22650.25 g/L and no prior treatment against BRD or other diseases were enrolled as cases. Cattle without any of the above\u2010mentioned signs were defined as control. Deep nasal swab (DNS) and trans\u2010tracheal aspirates (TTA) were collected from these animals (Timsit et al., 2013, 2018). Control steers were removed from the study if they became sick within 30 days of enrolment.",

Unmapped reads were extracted from the original fastq files using cdbyank. De novo assembly of unmapped reads was performed for each sample using Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) with default parameters. Assembled contigs were aligned to the virus Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database (Brister, Ako\u2010Adjei, Bao, & Blinkova, 2015) using BLASTn. As an initial screen of contigs for virus\u2010like sequences, contigs yielding alignments of at least 100 base pairs in length with the expectation (e) values <10\u22123 were analysed further. Contig sequences from each sample that passed this initial screen were examined manually by BLASTx comparison to the Genbank non\u2010redundant protein sequence database to confirm the nucleotide sequence\u2010based identification and remove any contigs with spurious matches such as vector sequences. The total number of reads of each virus in each sample library corresponding to the assembled contigs was determined by Bowtie2 mapping of reads from each sample on to the assembled contig sequences.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of identification of IDV in western Canada. IDV was initially identified in swine in the United States, and then was found to be prevalent in cattle of the United States, Luxembourg, Ireland, France, Japan and China (Flynn et al., 2018; Mekata et al., 2018; Snoeck et al., 2018; Su, Fu, Li, Kerlin, & Veit, 2017). IDV may be an emerging pathogen in Canadian cattle; or, on the other hand, the lack of Canadian reports before may be due to the unavailability of a diagnostic assay. IDV was also recently identified in sheep and goats (Quast et al., 2015). Although there is evidence that IDV can infect humans, whether it can cause disease is unclear at this point and the risk of zoonosis is considered to be low (Su et al., 2017). Preliminary evidence showed that IDV could be potentially associated with BRD (Mitra et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2015), and our study provided additional evidence for the role of IDV in BRD as its detection was significantly associated with BRD in single variable analysis. In a previous study, IDV was transmitted efficiently through direct contact, causing mild respiratory signs and the virus can be detected in the lung of affected animals by PCR (Ferguson et al., 2016). However, in that same study, the lack of pulmonary lesions and negative immunohistochemical staining suggested that IDV might mainly act in the upper respiratory tract (Ferguson et al., 2016). An inactivated IDV vaccine was developed recently, providing partial protection in cattle from mild respiratory disease, which further supports an aetiological role for IDV in BRD (Hause et al., 2017). The samples of our study were paired nasal swabs and tracheal washes and the majority of positive IDV samples were nasal swabs, which again suggested IDV might mainly cause upper respiratory tract infection.",

BRAV is composed of two serotypes, BRAV1 and BRAV2, while BRBV consists of one serotype, BRBV1. Both viruses are common in cattle in the United States (Hause, Collin, Anderson, Hesse, & Anderson, 2015). In this study, BRBV was significantly associated with BRD and there was a statistical trend of association between BRAV and BRD (Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, these two viruses have not previously been reported in Canada. The current data represent early evidence that these two viruses may play a role in BRD development. Further research is needed to verify the current data and study the mechanism by which BRAV and BRBV may be implicated in BRD development.",

On the other hand, it is not practical to collect tracheal washes for diagnostic purpose due to the laborious procedures. Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting negative diagnostic results based on only one location of the respiratory tract.",
