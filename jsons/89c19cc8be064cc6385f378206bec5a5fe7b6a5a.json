With the ability to identify a specific target in a biological sample, microarrays are also well-suited for detecting biological agents for genetic and chronic disease [2, 3, 4, 5] .

To list some advantages of selecting oligo probes by the proposed method, first, the method selects probes via sequential solution of a small number of compact set covering (SC) instances, which offers a great advantage from computational point of view. To be more specific, consider classification of two types of data and suppose that a training set is comprised of m + target and m \u2212 non-target sequences. The size of the SC training instances solved by the proposed method is minimum of m + and m \u2212 orders of magnitude smaller than optimization learning models used in [10, 11, 12] . Second, the method uses the sequence information only and selects probes via optimization based on principles of probability and statistics. That is, the probability of an l\u2212mer (oligo of length l) appearing in a single sequence by chance is (0.25) l , hence the probability of an l\u2212mer appearing in multiple samples of one type but in none or only a few of the sequences of the other type by chance alone is extremely small. Third, the proposed method does not rely on any extra tool, such as BLASTn [16] , a local sequence alignment search tool that is commonly used for probe selection [6, 8, 17] , or the existence of pre-selected representative probes [6] . This makes the method truly stand-alone and free of problems that may possibly be caused by limitations associated with external factors.
