Although rare, IMD affects all ages, and the brunt of the disease burden is highest in infants, children below 4 years of age and adolescents [1, 2]. Compared with other age groups, there is also a relatively increased incidence of IMD in the elderly who suffer the highest case fatality rates of all [1\u20133]. Despite advances in medical care, around 10% of individuals with IMD die, and up to 20\u201336% of survivors sustain permanent disabilities such as sensorineural hearing loss, neurodevelopmental problems, seizures and amputations [4\u20137].",

MenB still causes the majority of IMD within Europe, followed by MenC and more recently MenW [1]. In the USA, MenB, MenC and MenY are each responsible for around one third of the IMD cases [2]. Classically, MenA was a major cause of epidemics within countries in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa [8], with recent emergence of MenW, C and X disease [9, 10]. Nasopharyngeal carriage provides a continuous reservoir making eradication of the disease difficult. Migration and international travel poses a risk of transmission of Men capsular groups especially to family members within hosting countries [11].",

            "text": "The introduction of meningococcal conjugate vaccines on national immunization programmes has resulted in significant reductions in the corresponding burden of IMD. Control of IMD at a population level by meningococcal conjugate vaccines is not only a direct effect of protection of the vaccinated individuals but also is largely a result of their ability to interrupt transmission through reduction in meningococcal carriage rates, thus inducing a herd immune effect. This effect is only seen when adolescents, who are the main transmitters of the meningococcus, are included in meningococcal immunization strategies. Drastic reductions in IMD in all ages, including unvaccinated groups, have been observed with immunization programmes that included adolescents in catch-up or routine campaigns for MenC in Europe and Salvador in Brazil and MenA in Africa [12\u201316]. In contrast, exclusive vaccination of at-risk children < 5 years old against MenW disease with a MenACWY conjugate vaccine in Chile and with a MenC conjugate vaccine in Bahia, Brazil, without immunizing adolescents did not impact MenW and MenC disease in unvaccinated age groups, including the elderly, in the respective countries [15, 17]. The recent introduction of protein-based vaccines against MenB in developed countries holds promise for control of the most prevalent meningococcal capsular group although up until now their effect is only envisaged to result from direct protection since impact on nasopharyngeal carriage has not been demonstrated [18, 19].",

Cases were included if they satisfied the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) laboratory criteria for IMD which consisted of (a) identification of the meningococcus through culture or molecular methods from usual sterile sites (blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synovial fluid and any other usually sterile fluid) or from purpuric lesions or (b) detection of Gram-negative diplococci from direct visualization of the CSF or through a positive meningococcal rapid antigen screen (RAS) [22]. Subsequently, isolates were classified according to the capsular group, if groupable. Identification of the serogroups was performed by slide agglutination tests using specific capsular antisera (Remel Europe Ltd., Kent, UK). All isolates were sent to the Public Health England (PHE) Meningococcal Reference Unit (previously Health Protection Agency Meningococcal Reference Unit) in Manchester, UK, where the capsular group was reconfirmed and phenotyping was performed by identification of the serotypes and serosubtypes with monoclonal antibodies as described by Gray et al. [23]. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was not carried out. From 2012 to 2013, a polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) amplifying the specific capsular genes was performed at the PHE laboratory on CSF and/or blood of patients whose cultures were negative. In 2014, a meningococcal screening PCR was introduced at the microbiological laboratory in MDH, and any positive samples were sent to the PHE laboratory for capsular gene identification. Meningococcal capsular gene detection was performed at MDH in 2017. Meningococcal isolates identified from non-sterile sites such as throat or nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were excluded.",

Cases were notified to the IDCU by clinicians when a patient was clinically suspected to have IMD and subsequently by the laboratory when the meningococcus was identified in clinical specimens. When microbiological results did not reveal an invasive pathogen, IDCU contacted the clinicians to ascertain that the clinical picture, investigations and progress of the cases still satisfied the set case definitions of IMD.

The median was used in preference to the mean to describe the age demographics as in view of the relative rarity of IMD, it was expected to have a small number of cases with a wide age range. The proportion of laboratory-confirmed IMD cases was calculated per year from the total number of reported IMD cases. The disease burden caused by the different meningococcal capsular groups was calculated for each year from the number of laboratory confirmed isolates. The distribution of cases was analysed according to prespecified age groups as follows: < 1, 1\u20135, 6\u201310, 11\u201315, 16\u201320, 21\u201325, 26\u201345, 46\u201364 and \u2265 65+ years. A cut-off of < 16 years was taken to indicate the paediatric population as determined by the hospital admission policy for children in MDH, Malta. This enabled calculation of the age-specific incidence rates of meningococcal disease, and the corresponding 95% CI using a Poisson regression analysis, in Maltese children and identification of the target groups that would benefit from vaccination. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to analyse differences in the disease burden between the capsular groups. A p value < 0.05 for all analyses was taken as being statistically significant. The software STATA 13 was used for the analyses.",

Introduction of a MenB vaccine will address the most prevalent cause of IMD in Malta, although projections of vaccine effectiveness would require whole genome sequencing and vaccine antigen sequence typing of the MenB isolates. In the past, a serotype-specific MenB outer membrane vesicle vaccine, MenZB, that matched the MenB strain B:4:P1.7\u20132,4 causing a prolonged epidemic in New Zealand (which was used in a 3 dose schedule for mass vaccination of < 20 year olds from 2004 to 2006 and subsequently for routine infant vaccination up to 2008), had an estimated effectiveness of 80% in children < 5 years of age and an overall effectiveness of 68% [61, 62]. A reduced two-dose infant schedule of the currently available MenB-4C vaccine at 2 and 4 months followed by a boost at 12 months of age, as introduced in the UK, would be expected to result in a modest 59% vaccine effectiveness up to 2 years following the last vaccination assuming high vaccine coverage and favourable vaccine sequence matching with invasive MenB strains [37]. In contrast to meningococcal conjugate vaccines, indirect protection in unvaccinated population groups from herd immunity is very unlikely to be observed since MenB-4C has not been shown to reduce MenB carriage, or other pathogenic capsular types, in a large cohort of Australian adolescents [18] indicating that MenB transmission will still occur despite vaccination. Similarly, carriage data have also discouragingly not demonstrated a reduction in MenB carriage following vaccination with a Menb-fHbp vaccine during an outbreak [19]. The lack of an impact on MenB carriage makes the utility of catch-up vaccination campaigns against MenB questionable [18, 19]. Protection against MenB disease in infancy, early childhood and adolescence will have to rely on the direct protection offered by a MenB vaccine. Infant MenB vaccine priming and boost schedules will still need boosting in adolescence as, similar to the antibody decline seen with conjugate MenC vaccines, bactericidal antibody will not last into the teenage years [63, 64]. Introduction of MenB vaccination at 2 and 4 months with a boost at 12 months of age together with two-dose vaccination of adolescents starting from the age of 12 years would be expected to have an impact on MenB disease in Malta.",

A mean of 1296 conjugate vaccines against MenC was given per year in children aged < 16 years, amounting to vaccination of around 2% of the paediatric population per year (National Immunization Service, personal communication; Pfizer Malta, Vivian Corporation, personal communication). Such practice of meningococcal conjugate vaccination on request results in individual protection, but considering the epidemiology of MenC, W and Y disease over the last 10 years is evidently not enough to induce herd protection. Control of infant MenC and W disease in Malta may be achieved with the introduction of a routine infant MenACWY vaccination programme consisting of a single MenACWY dose at 3 months of age, followed by a 12 month boost, a schedule which would induce protective MenC bactericidal antibodies in infants and toddlers [65] and with extrapolation also to MenW. This would have potentially prevented 30.4% (7/23) and 40% (2/5) of cases of invasive MenC and MenW disease, assuming 100% vaccine efficacy. An effective national MenACWY conjugate vaccine strategy would also need to target adolescents, not only to target MenY disease observed in 11\u201320 year olds in Malta but also to contribute towards a desired herd immune effect and reduce the corresponding IMD in non-vaccinated groups, especially in the elderly > 65 years of age in whom 83.3% (10/12) of IMD was caused by MenC, W and Y. Furthermore, adolescent vaccination would eventually serve the purpose of boosting those children who would have received the routine infant and toddler MenACWY schedule since adequate protection against all of these capsular groups will not persist until adolescence [66, 67].",

Such a schedule using a monovalent MenC conjugate vaccine was introduced in Ontario, Canada, in 2004/2005 [68]. Although a reduction in invasive capsular group C disease was seen in vaccinated and unvaccinated age groups, the reduction in the incidence of MenC disease in infants over the subsequent 8 years was not statistically significant [68]. In contrast, the introduction of routine MenCC vaccination in 2001 in 14-month-old children following a catch-up vaccine campaign in 14-month to 18-year-olds in The Netherlands resulted in control of invasive MenC disease, even in infants [69]. Similarly, the introduction of routine infant MenC conjugate vaccination in 1999 concurrently with a catch-up vaccine campaign in 1 to 25-year-olds in the UK was also successful [70], although a MenC boost was introduced at 12 months of age in 2006 due to low vaccine efficacy rates just within 4 years of infant vaccination [12]. The importance of a catch-up campaign targeting adolescents and young adults to control MenC disease was also observed in Brazil where sole vaccination of children < 5 years of age in the state of Bahia did not result in a herd immune effect in contrast to Salvador where the concurrent introduction of a catch-up campaign targeting 10\u201324-year-olds resulted in control of MenC disease in all age groups [15]. Similarly, vaccination of 9-month to 4-year-old children with a conjugate MenACWY vaccine without adolescent catch-up vaccination did not control MenW disease on a population level in Chile [17].",

Such induction of herd protection would translate in a reduction in IMD in older unvaccinated individuals (as seen in countries introducing a MenC catch-up vaccination programme), the disease burden in whom was substantial over the last 18 years (47.4%, 18/38 cases) in Malta. Herd immunity against MenC, W and Y could then be sustained through a routine MenACWY vaccine dose at 12 years of age. Once the epidemiology of Men disease shows that control of invasive MenC and W disease in infants has been achieved (reflecting minimal MenC and W transmission), which, as seen in the UK for MenC, would be expected to be reached within 5 years [70], then the infant MenACWY dose may be dropped. This would leave a routine meningococcal conjugate vaccine schedule consisting of a single MenACWY dose at 12 months of age, which is important for priming, followed by a booster dose in adolescence. The induction of robust protection against invasive MenACWY disease in adolescence would protect teenagers and young adults from possible transmission of these capsular groups from the large number of foreigners that visit Malta and mix with the young population in summer.",

Adolescents receive a tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated polio (Td-IPV) vaccine at 14-16 years with girls being vaccinated with 2 doses of the human papilloma virus vaccine at 12\u2013<13 years of age. Introduction of a conjugate MenACWY vaccine at 3 months and 12 months of age with another routine dose at 12 years would easily fit within this schedule even when a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is eventually introduced. Similarly, MenB vaccination in a 2, 4 infant priming and 12 month boost in addition to two-dose vaccination starting from 12 years of age can also be easily accommodated within the national vaccination programme.",

Furthermore, a MenB immunization programme consisting of a 2 dose prime and boost MenB infant vaccine schedule in addition to MenB adolescent vaccination at 12 years of age would also be projected to provide direct protection and reduce the incidence of MenB, which is responsible for the highest meningococcal disease burden in Malta.",
