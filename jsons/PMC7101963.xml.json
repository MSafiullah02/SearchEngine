            "text": "Since the first case of human infection in March 2013, continuous H7N9 influenza A viruses (IAV) infection cases were reported in both humans and birds, and more than 500 laboratory-confirmed human cases with over 30 % fatality highlight the potential pandemic threat [1]. Though H7N9 IAV is avian origin, it shows low pathogenicity in birds but with signs of adaptation to mammalian species, including increased ability to bind with mammalian cell receptors, and replicate at temperature close to the normal body temperature of mammals which is lower than that of birds. Almost all H7N9 IAVs isolated from human have an amino acid change at site 226 in HA which contributed to dual receptor-binding property [2]. A H7N9 IAV strain isolated from Anhui, China, can bind human receptors while it still retains the avian receptor-binding property [3]. An E-to-K amino acid change at residue 627 of polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) occurred frequently in the H7N9 IAV isolates obtained from human, but not in viruses isolated from poultry. Mok et al. [4] tested the importance of PB2-627K using A/Shanghai/2/2013 as backbone and found that this amino acid change contributed to mammalian adaptation. Mice infected with the H7N9 IAV mutant containing the avian signature protein PB2-627E showed a marked decrease in weight loss and pathological lesions compared to mice infected with the wild-type strain (PB2-627K) [4]. H7N9 can induce pneumonia and hypoxic hepatitis [5], leading to systemic immune response [6]. As to human beings, clinical presentation of H7N9 IAV infection is characterized by rapidly progressing severe pneumonia and induced complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multi-organ failure [7]. Host clearance of IAV requires the development of host\u2019s inflammation-related responses [8, 9], especially associated with exuberant pulmonary inflammation characterized by influx of inflammatory cells and production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and so forth. However, the detailed systematic data of H7N9 IAVs inducing the inflammatory responses of host are still obscure.",

            "text": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are responsible for identifying pathogen-associated molecular patterns which promote the initiation and orchestration of innate and adaptive immune response [10]. At the early stage of IAVs infection, the viral RNA, which is present in infected cells, is recognized as foreign by various PRRs, which leads to the secretion of type I interferon (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, eicosanoids and chemokines. Nod-like receptors (NLRs), one of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), play a central role in inflammation development in virus infection and regulate the host response to adaptive immunity [11]. Among various types of inflammasome, the NLRP3 inflammasome is well characterized in a variety of mammalian cells and contributes to regulate the cleavage and maturation of pro-IL-1\u03b2, the inactive precursor of IL-1\u03b2 [12]. IL-1\u03b2 binding with its receptors induces the activation of multiple cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 [13], playing the vital role during the early stage of host defense against IAVs infection [14]. With the disease development, IAVs-infected dead cells release intracellular components which stimulate the immune cells. This is dependent on the activity of the receptor-interacting protein 3(RIP3) which could switch TNF-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis by regulating TNF-induced reactive oxygen species production [15, 16] and accelerate systematic inflammation and thus lead to mortality [17]. In addition, RIP3 initiates mitochondrial fission to active NLRP3 inflammasome [18] which would accelerate the inflammatory response. Though these cytokines and chemokines could result in infiltration of leukocytes to the site of infection, which would be beneficial, the resulting \u201ccytokine storm\u201d also contributes to pathogenesis and mortality [19]. The inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, which directly combat the infectious agent and activate additional immune and inflammation response, injure the host by triggering leakage from capillaries, tissue edema and organ failure. This is one of the major reasons that lead to the pathogenesis and the poor medical outcome during the late stage of IAV infection. Therefore, for survival of the infected patients or animals, a balance must be struck between the protective response and the excessive inflammatory response.",

Slit2 is a secreted protein, which was previously known for its role of repulsion in axon guidance and neuronal migration, can also inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis induced by chemotactic factors [22]. During IAVs infection, cytokines produced in host inflammatory response lead to internalization of VE-cadherin and disruption of barrier function, which results in vascular leak and accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid in the alveolar space. Binding with Robo4, Slit2 enhances vascular barrier function against multiple cytokines by enhancing VE-cadherin, a primary molecular determinant of intact barrier function in the endothelium, at the cell surface [19]. Thus, this strengthened barrier can protect host from the lethal effects of inflammatory response induced by influenza infection.",

Relative expression levels of RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, Slit2 and Robo4 were determined by real-time PCR using DNA Engine 7500 Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM Kit (Takara Biotech, Dalian, China). Primers used for qRT-PCR (Table 1) were designed with Oligo 7 software (Molecular Biology Insights Inc., Cascade, CO, USA).The melting curves for each PCR were carefully analyzed to avoid non-specific amplifications in PCR products. The relative expression levels of these genes were calculated by normalizing the levels of gene transcripts to that of \u03b2-actin transcripts using a relative standard curve method through 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct formula. The data were confirmed with three repeat experiments. The statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software (version 20.0), and the figure was made by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). One-way ANOVA and t test were used to determine statistical significance between samples in relative expression levels of RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, Slit2 and Robo4 among different groups at different time point, respectively.\n",

            "text": "Novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus has emerged in China since the first human case reported in 2013, and there were 655 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in mainland China by 15 June 2015 [28]. The clinical characteristics of these patients often included fever and cough, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [29, 30], and human H7N9 IAV infection cases showed the significant association between a longer incubation period and a greater risk of death [28]. Researches about host responses induced by influenza virus showed that through the recognition of pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs) by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [31, 32], mainly containing the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and NOD-like receptor family members (NLRs) [33\u201337], the host can block virus replication and promote viral clearance. Among these PRRs, NLRP3 is vital and efficient for cell-intrinsic recognition [38] and its activation and function is closely associated with RIP3. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complexes results in the autocatalytic processing of pro-caspase 1 into its active from and then cleaves pro-IL-1\u03b2 into IL-1\u03b2. Then mediated by TLR, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) signaling, cytokine production and secretion are triggered including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 [39], which contributes to the defense against IAVs infection of host [14, 40].",

In this research, we considered the mRNA expression and protein distribution of Slit2 and Robo4 during H7N9 IAV infection, which could limit the disruptive effects of proinflammatory mediators on the vasculature. Previous reports showed that by mounting a protective adaptive immune response, the host could survive from the infection of sub-lethal doses of influenza A virus or with inactive virus [9, 42]. In this research, we choose the H7N9 IAV strains of A/Chicken/Guangdong/G1/2013 (VK627) and its site-mutation virus (rVK627E) with low pathogenic, which would be suitable for the research of the potential mechanism of inflammatory response induced by IAV infection in mice.",

            "text": "Result of the virulence of H7N9 IAV in BALB/c mice demonstrated that VK627 caused more serious histopathological changes than that in rVK627E group. It is noticeable that after 5 dpi, VK627 virus induced continuously slightly interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of inflammatory cells, whereas the rVK627E virus showed only slightly and locally venous hyperemia in alveolar wall. Coincidently, mRNA expression level of RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 continuously significantly higher in VK627 group than that in rVK627E, which might contribute to the more serious interstitial pneumonia in VK627 group. This result was similar to that of Mok et al. [4]. In return, the dramatic increase expression level of Slit2 and Robo4 after 3 dpi might be the main factor to inhibit the interstitial pneumonia and infiltration in rVK627E group, while interstitial pneumonia and infiltration in the VK627 group maintained, in which the expression of Slit2 and Robo4 exhibited similar level to control group. However, it is interesting that from 1 to 3 dpi, the expression of Slit2 and Robo4 in both infected groups was significantly lower than in control, and it seems that there would be a potential mechanism of IAVs to inhibit the Slit2\u2013Robo4 signaling pathway which deserves further detailed research. Similarly, immunohistochemistry showed that stronger stain of RIP3, NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 protein was detected in the lung tissues of VK627 group than that in rVK627E group at 5 dpi, while stronger stain of Slit2 and Robo4 protein was detected in rVK627E group than that in VK627 group at the same time point. This implied that both VK627 and rVK627E H7N9 IAV could induce the host response in the lung of BALB/c mice, while more serious tissue lesion was companied with higher level of cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 during VK627 infection compared with rVK627E. However, BALB/c mice infected with rVK627E might be associated with the function of Slit2\u2013Robo4 signaling pathway.",
