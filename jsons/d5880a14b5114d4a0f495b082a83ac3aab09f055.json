All four patients with baseline abnormalities in liver enzymes were noted to have at least a two-fold elevation in liver enzymes during their SARS-CoV-2 disease course. Among those with abnormalities in liver chemistries, we noted slightly higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as shown in Table 1 Isolated AST involvement can potentially indicate a non-hepatic etiology, however autopsy reports of a patient with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed moderate microvesicular steatosis with mild lobular and portal inflammatory activity suggestive of direct viral injury within the liver, compared to only minimal interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in cardiac biopsies. 5 Additionally, in a sub-analysis of our data, 43 patients were screened for cardiac injury with troponin I or T enzyme levels, and only 3 were noted to have positive cardiac biomarkers.

As evaluation of SARS-COV2 at our hospital was streamlined, exhaustive documentation of non-respiratory symptoms may be incomplete. Moreover, testing was currently only offered under specific criteria (that required pulmonary symptoms) and could have missed patients with gastrointestinal symptoms only, thereby underestimating the true prevalence of gastrointestinal involvement. It is also unclear if our results can be extrapolated to asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients that do not seek medical care.",

Two patients had abnormal bilirubin levels during their presentation however they also had abnormal bilirubin levels at baseline.The severity of overall illness and level of care were associated with aspartate aminotransferase levels at the time of presentation (Pearson coefficient 0.33, P = 0.009). No other variables, including presence of gastrointestinal disease, correlated to disease severity.DiscussionTo our knowledge this is the largest published analysis of an American cohort of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. We noted that a significant proportion (31.9%) of patients experience concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms prior to presentation. Additionally, elevations in AST levels correlated to severity of disease. However, none of the patients in this cohort developed gastrointestinal symptoms as the initial presentation or as isolated symptomatology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Previous reports of gastrointestinal symptomatology in SARS-CoV-2 have varied, with estimates ranging from 5-50%.[2][3] While, the etiology for the gastrointestinal symptoms noted in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown; ACE2, a cellular receptor, appears to play a critical role in the life cycle and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and is widely expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.4",
