The aftermath of recent major storms is still being felt, perhaps no more so than by the survivors of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas [1, 2]. Dorian was the fifth Category 5 Atlantic hurricane to make landfall since 2016. Its protracted passage over the Northwest Bahamas underscored two very dangerous trends: (1) hurricanes are becoming increasingly hazardous and (2) hardships associated with these storms are disproportionately challenging for those with chronic medical problems [1, 2]. These observations have important implications for safeguarding individuals with disabilities and special medical needs residing in coastal or island communities, especially those living with spinal cord injury (SCI) [3].",

Collectively, these storms are becoming stronger, in terms of higher peak wind speeds and rapid intensification, and wetter, in terms of increased precipitation rates and rainfall totals [4\u20136]. Moreover, the forward motion \u201ctranslational\u201d speed of some storms slows to near standstill above populated areas, adding to the devastation and trauma experienced by the affected communities [6, 7]. As a memorable example, after making landfall in 2017, Hurricane Harvey hovered over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico for 4 days, producing trains of rain bands that deluged the Houston area [8]. An examination of the environmental justice implications of Hurricane Harvey found that flooding was considerably worse in areas with a greater proportion of residents with disabilities [9].",

Because individuals with SCI face unique challenges in the aftermath of major hurricanes, evacuation in advance of a storm may be considered. However, individuals with disabilities are less likely to evacuate in a disaster [10]. Persons with SCI may have limited options for transportation and sheltering. Indeed, the lack of accessible transportation was cited as a major factor impeding disabled individuals from evacuating their homes during Hurricane Katrina, resulting in at least one death of an individual with tetraplegia [11]. Personnel staffing medical shelters may lack the expertise to meet the care needs of this population. The need for an accessible environment may preclude an alternative option of being able to ride out a storm in the home of friends or family members who live outside the hurricane impact zone. In addition, some persons with SCI require equipment for life or function that may be difficult to transport, such as respiratory equipment and mechanical lifts. As such, individuals living with SCI must weigh the difficulties involved in evacuating one\u2019s home and community against the considerable risks of remaining in an area where a major hurricane is predicted to strike.",

Moreover, an already-strained health care system and workforce may be left unable to provide necessary care for storm-related illnesses and injuries.",
