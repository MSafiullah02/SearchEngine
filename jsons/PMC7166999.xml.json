            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease which has caught the attention not only of the scientific community, but also of the public. Infection is usually characterized by fever, dry cough, myalgia, and mild sore throat, which progresses to atypical pneumonia. SARS is caused by a newly identified virus within the family Coronaviridae\n1, 2, 3. This virus has been designated SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) 4. The overall genome of many SARS\u2010CoV strains has been sequenced. It is an enveloped, single\u2010stranded, plus\u2010sense RNA virus with a genome of \u223c30 kb 5, 6. From 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003, 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries were reported as a result of SARS by the World Health Organization 7. Although the initial global outbreak of SARS seems to be under control, SARS will remain a serious concern while there are no suitable measures for curing this disease.",

The SARS\u2010CoV rep gene comprises approximately two\u2010thirds of the genome and incorporates a ribosomal slippage site 5, 6, 8. Translation without ribosomal frameshifting generates the Orf1a protein and the (\u22121) frameshift results in translation of the extended Orf1ab polyprotein 8. These products are then auto\u2010cleaved by the main proteinase (3CLpro), which is encoded within the 5\u2032\u2010proximal region of the rep gene 9, to generate several nonstructural proteins including the main proteinase (3CLpro), the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the RNA helicase. The structural proteins S, E, M and N are common to all known coronaviruses 5. They function during host cell entry and viron morphogenesis and release 10, 11. During viron assembly, N binds to a defined packaging signal on viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid. M is localized at intracellular membrane structures. The interaction between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids results in budding through the membrane. The S protein is a membranous glycoprotein and is important for viral entry and might define host range, tissue tropism and virulence 12, 13.",

            "text": "Antisense technology has become a widely used research tool for the specific inhibition of gene expression. It has attracted considerable attention as a potential therapeutic strategy 14, 15. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), usually 18\u201321 nucleotides in length, could sequence\u2010specifically hybridize to the target mRNA through Watson\u2010Crick base pairing to form an mRNA/DNA duplex, which is then degraded by RNAse H, a ubiquitously expressed endonuclease which hydrolyses the RNA strand of the heteroduplex. The antisense ODNs might also physically block mRNA function (e.g. translation) or gene transcription 14. Therefore, treatment based on an antisense technique only demands knowledge of the DNA sequence of the gene and not of the function of the protein. Antisense ODNs play potential roles in the treatment of many diseases, such as cancer, influenza, AIDS and other diseases 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. The problems of nuclease sensitivity and lower cellular uptake limit antisense oligonucleotides in in vivo applications 22. More stable oligonucleotide derivatives, such as methylphosphonates 23, phosphorothioates 24, and phosphoramidites 25, have been designed. Among these derivatives, phosphorothioate oligonucleotide seems to be a potential antiviral therapeutic agent. In this study, we selected antisense phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide (antisense PS\u2010ODN, 20mer) complementary to 20\u2010base segments within the transcripts of SARS\u2010CoV structural proteins E, M and N.",

The down\u2010regulation effect of antisense PS\u2010ODN added to the culture medium as a free oligonucleotide is varied between different cell types. This could be due to different intracellular concentrations of the PS\u2010ODN, to cell\u2010type\u2010specific differences in the level of RNase H, which is supposed to be a main factor in antisense inhibition of gene expression mediated by PS\u2010ODNs 26. A FAM\u2010labeled antisense PS\u2010ODN (No.13) was cotransfected with its target gene expression construct (pCDNA3.1/M) to the Vero E6 cells by adding it to the medium directly at a final concentration of 50 \u00b5M. The cell cultures were washed with fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS 24 h post\u2010transfection to remove the FAM\u2010labeled PS\u2010ODN. Microscopic examination of the green fluorescence was performed on days 1, 3, and 5 post\u2010transfection (Figure 1). Fluorescence signals were mainly distributed in the cytoplasms after 24 h (Figures 1A and 1B). A nuclear accumulation of PS\u2010ODN was observed in about 5% of the Vero E6 cells. Three and 5 days post\u2010transfection, fluorescence signals could still be observed in the same pattern of distribution (Figures 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F). These results indicated that the antisense PS\u2010ODN at a high concentration of 50 \u00b5M in the culture medium could be taken up by Vero E6 cells and could remain stably in the cytoplasm and the nucleus for a long time.",

The expression did not vary for increasing concentrations of the scrambled oligo within this range suggesting that the inhibition obtained with the antisense oligo was sequence\u2010specific (Figure 3A). We tested for different toxicities of the oligos in a setup using 2, 10, 30, and 50 \u00b5M of the No.13 oligo. The total number of living and dead cells at the termination of the experiment revealed no significant differences between the antisense\u2010treated and the scrambled\u2010treated cultures (Table 3). This indicates that the observed antisense downregulation of SARS\u2010CoV gene expression is not due to toxic effects of these oligos.",

The cells were examined 48 h post\u2010transfection. To show the specificity of the antisense effect, we used scrambled oligo and antisense PS\u2010ODNs targeting other SARS\u2010CoV genes as controls. Microscopic examination of the green fluorescence revealed that the No.2 and No.4 antisense PS\u2010ODNs could reduce the expression of the E\u2010EGFP fusion protein in the cells. However, the No.13 and No.20 antisense PS\u2010ODNs, which could reduce the expression of M\u2010EGFP and N\u2010EGFP, respectively, had no effect on E\u2010EGFP expression (Figures 5A and 5D). The No.11 and No.13 antisense PS\u2010ODNs could reduce the expression of the M\u2010EGFP protein, whereas the No.4 and No.20 antisense PS\u2010ODNs targeting E and N respectively had no effect on M\u2010EGFP (Figures 5B and 5E).

These structural proteins were attractive targets for the development of an anti\u2010SARS agent. Among these proteins, we selected E, M, and N as the targets of antisense oligos. A characteristic of RNA viruses is the high rate of genetic mutation, which leads to evolution of new viral strains and is a mechanism by which viruses escape host defenses. The spike protein, a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface, was crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. In addition, variations of S protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism 27. China confirmed a new case of SARS on January 5, 2004. It is the country's first new case since the outbreak last year. The results of genetic sequencing of samples from the latest patient with SARS show that variation of the S gene existed in this SARS\u2010CoV strain 28. Since the S1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety for coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein, it is prone to high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations 29. Therefore, we have not chosen the S protein as a target of antisense oligos. In this work, we have evaluated the down\u2010regulation effects of 26 antisense PS\u2010ODNs targeting different sites along the open reading frames (ORFs) of E, M, and N proteins and obtained 12 antisense oligos which could reduce target gene expression by over 50% in Vero E6 cells at the concentration of 50 \u00b5M in the culture medium. Therefore, we could have many choices when one target site is mutated.",

Because SARS is dangerous for its high morbidity and mortality rates, it is safer and more convenient to study anti\u2010SARS agents by using Vero E6 cells transfected with SARS\u2010CoV gene expression vectors. In this cell model, we obtained an antisense sequence\u2010specific downregulation of SARS\u2010CoV gene expression as seen from the results of RT\u2010PCR and from a reduced fluorescence intensity of EGFP to which the SARS\u2010CoV protein E, M, or N was fused.",

Therefore, we used high concentrations of the free antisense PS\u2010ODNs in the cell culture medium to increase the intracellular concentrations of the PS\u2010ODNs. In experiments with FAM\u2010labeled antisense oligos in concentrations of 50 \u00b5M, we observed that most Vero E6 cells internalized antisense oligos in the cytoplasm and about 5% of the Vero E6 cells showed nuclear uptake of the oligo. The FAM\u2010labeled PS\u2010ODN also showed high stability in Vero E6 cells. In accordance with this, we obtained a long antisense downregulation effect in Vero E6 cells. As antisense PS\u2010ODNs may not work well in in vivo treatment of diseases because of a fast breakdown and of possible toxicity, more suitable antisense oligonucleotide derivatives have been developed for therapeutic use, for example, NeuGenes antisense compounds (AVI Biopharma 34) and locked oligonucleotides. They displayed advantageous pharmaceutical properties in stability, specificity, efficacy, delivery and safety. However, the PS\u2010ODNs can play an important role in further studies of pathological functions of SARS genes in the Vero E6 cell model for a future treatment and cure.",
