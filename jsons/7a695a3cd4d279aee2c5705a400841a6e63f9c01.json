While complications associated with IUD use are rare, they range from expulsion to uterine perforation. Numerous reports have been published regarding the sequelae of intraperitoneal copper IUDs or retained fragments following the removal of a fractured device. No data exist, however, on the intraperitoneal retention of copper following the removal of an otherwise intact IUD. Here we present two patients in whom copper IUDs were found to have missing fragments of copper wire despite removal of an otherwise intact IUD found in utero. We caution providers to examine all removed devices carefully, to surgically address intraperitoneal copper in order to mitigate adhesion formation, and to counsel patients about this potentially serious complication. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof IUD inserted outside the U.S. 10 years previously. At the initial visit, an annual breast and pelvic exam were done and a Pap smear was collected. Bimanual exam was significant for an anteverted uterus which was mildly tender at the fundus, as well as tenderness of the left adnexa. Notably, the strings of the IUD were not visualized on speculum exam. She was prescribed a 21-day course of Microgestin (1 mg norethindrone acetate and 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol) in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13. Ingec M, Kumtepe Y, Kadanali S, Ozdiller O.

IUDs currently available in the United States are small, T-shaped plastic devices imbued with varying concentrations of progestins or copper, which are inserted into the uterine cavity by a healthcare provider and left in place for 3-10 years, depending on the device. In addition to the convenience and discretion of a contraceptive which is administered only once every several years, IUDs also confer significant health benefits. Hormonal IUDs are routinely used to treat excessive menstruation and pelvic pain associated with endometriosis and adenomyosis. There are also data to suggest these devices may play a role in the clearance of HPV infection as well as the prevention of gynecologic cancers [1, 2] .",

Of those, 10 .3% reported using a longacting reversible contraceptive (LARC) such as an IUD or hormonal implant [3, 4] . An analysis of survey data from 2008-2014 noted a rise in IUD use from 6% to 14% accompanied by the concurrent drop in permanent sterilization in the same group from 37% to 28%, perhaps suggesting a changing preference toward reversible, less invasive contraception [5] .",

Uterine perforation has also been reported in 0.2% of patients in clinical trials of the copper IUD [6] . Device migration, movement of the device outside the uterine cavity, is an uncommon phenomenon which has been reported almost exclusively in case reports.

While the exact mechanism is unknown, researchers suggest endometrial secretions near the cervix create a more corrosive environment leading to disproportionate damage to the copper coil on the long arm of the device [20] . Another purported mechanism of degradation is via the presence of Actinomyces species, which have been shown to colonize IUDs [21] .",

Specifically, providers should ascertain the exact type of device they plan to remove and be aware of all device components, such as copper coils and hormone release capsules. In a 1987 report on intrauterine devices, the World Health Organization recommended the prompt removal of migrated IUDs even when discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic patient [22] . This recommendation is especially poignant for patients using copper IUDs given the established propensity of copper to induce inflammation and adhesion formation within the peritoneum. While the IUDs we encountered in the above cases were found in utero, we feel this work allows for the extension of the WHO recommendation to include removal of any retained copper following the removal of a copper IUD. Providers should strive for prompt minimally invasive copper fragment removal as patients in whom intervention is delayed ultimately require more invasive procedures. While we present evidence for the previously theoretical complication of retained copper fragments following the removal of a copper IUD, we stress the rarity of such complications and the continued safety of IUDs. It is our hope that this report will also inform the counseling of future patients regarding the risks of copper IUD use. Given that copper IUDs are composed of a polyethylene J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof backbone and three copper coils, patients should be notified of the risk of these additional components separating from the device when compared to the hormonal or plain IUD. Furthermore, patients should be advised they may require surgery to remove any retained copper fragments in order to mitigate dangerous sequelae such as adhesion formation.",
