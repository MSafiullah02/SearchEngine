After that, in the American continent, the United States has also been hit very hard with the spread of the virus.

The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, but the quick human to human transfer has been confirmed in many experiments. Nowadays there is not yet a clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine that can be used against COVID-19. Recently at the end of 2019, the city of Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the current COVID-19 experienced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that killed more than eighteen hundred and infected thousands of individuals within the first two months of the epidemic [9]. More recently, the epicenter has moved to other cities in Europe and then in America.",

Another interesting study is the investigation of the cases of COVID-19 in China using dynamic statistical techniques [12]. Other cases are: predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus using a deep learning model [13] and early prediction of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in mainland China based on simple mathematical model [14]. Also, the paper in [15] offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. In addition, in [16] the authors proposed applying the concept of cartograms to visualize both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. Finally, we have to mention that some research has been done using Artificial Intelligence (AI), for example the study in [17] in which the authors proposed the use of machine learning algorithms for improving possible case identifications of COVID-19 more quickly when using a mobile phone-based web survey. Also several AI techniques are applied in analyzing data and decision-making processes in healthcare. This means that AI-driven tools can help in identifying COVID-19 outbreaks, as well as forecast their nature of spread rate across the world [18].",

Of course, this facet of the problem is also important, as governments want to be able to know the estimated future values of the coronavirus cases to make the right decisions regarding funds to be assigned to solving the problem. On the other hand, it is our firm believe that the spatial aspect is also very important, so in this regard the main contribution of this paper is the use of unsupervised self-organizing Kohonen maps for grouping together similar countries in their fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, and thus in this way be able to propose that strategies for similar countries could be established accordingly. In our opinion, this contribution is very important as it could complement the temporal perspective that has been developed by most of the previous papers by providing the spatial component to achieve a complete solution to the Coronavirus problem.",

            "text": "The Self-organizing maps (SOM), also called the Kohonen map, is a model being used to explore and visualize patterns in high-dimensional datasets. This model was first introduced by Teuvo Kalevi Kohonen in 1982. SOM is a clustering technique that identifies groups in a dataset without having to use traditional statistical techniques. The SOM consists of only two layers: the input layer and the output layer [1]. The goal of this neural network is to transfer all input data objects with n attributes (n dimensions) to the output in a way that the objects are related to each other. The SOM is based on an unsupervised training where there is no given output target, the objective of the algorithm is to find the set of centroids (neurons) to represent the cluster, but with topological restrictions. Topology refers to a centroid arrangement on the output grid, the most common used topology grids are the hexagonal and rectangular. Each of all data objects in the dataset is assigned to each centroid. Each neuron in the SOM grid is closely related to each other and each of the inputs are connected to each of the output nodes by means of a connection weight. Weights from N input nodes to M output nodes are initialized in small values randomly [2]. The activation of the output units according to Kohonen's is shown in the Eq. 1. The modification of the weights is shown in Eq. 2:(1)Oj=Fmindj=Fmin(\u2211i(Xi\u2212Wij)2)\n(2)\u0394Wij=Oj\u03b7(Xi\u2212Wij)where Oj=activation of output unit j, Xi=activation value from input unit, Wji= lateral weights connecting to output unit, dj= neurons in neighborhood, Fmin= unity function returning 1 or 0, \u03b7= gain term decreasing over time.",

Based on the clustering abilities of self-organizing maps we were able to spatially group together countries that are similar according to their coronavirus cases, in this way being able to analyze which countries are behaving similarly and thus can benefit by using similar strategies in dealing with the spread of the virus. Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months were used in the analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained, that could be helpful in deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus. In addition, the proposed approach was tested with the spatial distribution of cases around the country of Mexico and its relation to the Diabetes and Hypertension cases. Most of the previous papers dealing with data of the Coronavirus have viewed the problem on its temporal aspect, which is also important, but this is mainly concerned with the forecast of the numeric information. However, we believe that the spatial aspect is also important, so in this view the main contribution of this paper is the use of unsupervised self-organizing maps for grouping together similar countries in their fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, and thus proposing that strategies for similar countries could be established accordingly. As future work, we envision integrating both the spatial and temporal aspects of the Coronavirus spread problem in a unified manner to achieve a complete view and solution to the problem. We can also consider applying other intelligent techniques (like fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) that could help in dealing in a better way with this complex problem. Finally, we could also consider other recent approaches, as the ones presented in [20, 21], and other recent interesting works related to evolving fuzzy models and chaos, like in [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. In summary, we envision that there are many potential beneficial lines of research that could be engaged.",
