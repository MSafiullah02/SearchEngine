Aptamers possess key advantages over antibodies due to their increased flexibility and the nature of in vitro evolution. They have low variability between batches, do not rely on animals for their production, can be created against toxic or non-immunogenic targets, are economical and fast to produce, and can be synthesized against a complex target without prior knowledge of a specific target molecule or without purifying a known target molecule.",

Gram-negative bacteria possess a negatively-charged outer membrane that can repel nucleic-acid molecules. Capsules covering the surface of many pathogenic bacteria can also obscure target proteins. Both of these factors make it difficult to generate aptamers that bind to the surface molecules of bacterial cells. In addition, bacteria often grow much faster than culture cells of mammalian tissue. Short generation times lead to rapid changes in protein expression and high surface variation between cultures and colonies. Such variation can impede consistent measurement of aptamer binding.",

Briefly, pathogenic bacterial cells are incubated in solution with a randomized nucleic-acid library. Cell-bound nucleic acids are separated from unbound nucleic acids via centrifugation. Cells are then washed, and cell-bound nucleic acids are eluted using low salt concentrations at high temperature. Cell-bound aptamers can also be amplified directly from the cell surface. Aptamer pools obtained after each round are screened for increased target-cell-binding affinity (e.g., by flow-cytometry analysis). Rounds of counter-selection against non-target cells, in which the sequences bound to the nontarget cells are removed, can be introduced after the first two rounds of positive selection. Alternatively, positive selection and counter-selection rounds can be alternated. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of selecting aptamers for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A summary of pathogenic whole cell and whole virus targets is presented in Table 2\n.",

The process begins with incorporation of modified nts (four dUTP analogs) into the DNA library by polymerase extension of a primer annealed to a biotinylated template. After separation from biotinylated templates, the DNA library containing modified nts is incubated with the target molecule. The slow off-rate enrichment and partition process is subsequently performed with the partition step of high stringency, including the use of extensive washing with large volumes. After separation of the bound DNA from the unbound DNA, the enriched DNA sequences are amplified by PCR to prepare the DNA pool for the next round of selection. Because the chemically-modified dUTP analogs in the modified DNA library and the enriched DNA pools contain functional groups that mimic amino-acid side-chains, the SOMAmers generated are thought to have some \u201cprotein-like\u201d properties [12]. The expanded chemical diversity due to the incorporation of the modified nts extends SELEX to selection of aptamers against more difficult targets (e.g., carbohydrates on microbial cell surface and wide range of protein targets). Indeed, huge potential has been demonstrated from the success of obtaining aptamers (with pool Kd values below 30 nM) against 1200 human proteins [12].",

After washing the beads, target proteins in complexes were then modified with a NHS-biotin tag. The complexes were photocleaved from the first set of beads and challenged with a polyanionic competitor (dextran sulfate) for selective disruption of non-specific binding interactions. The complexes were further attached via the target protein biotin to a second set of avidin-coated beads. After the free SOMAmers were washed away, the bound SOMAmers were released from their targets and quantified. The number of SOMAmers was directly proportional to the number of target molecules (i.e. one SOMAmer per analyte). The utility of the SOMAmer assay was demonstrated by measuring 813 different proteins with pM levels of LODs and 7 logs of overall dynamic range.

The slow off-rate enrichment and partition process involving high stringency was used to separate and to enrich the DNA sequences that were bound to the target molecule.
