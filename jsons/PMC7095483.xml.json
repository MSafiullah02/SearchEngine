The mortality rate was 5\u20137% in hospitalized patients and approximately 20% among those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [2]. The H1N1 infection occasionally developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and in some cases the hypoxemia was so severe as to require advanced rescue therapies, such as extracorporeal support. To the best of our knowledge, however, the quantitative characteristics of the ARDS due to the H1N1 virus as assessed by computed tomography (CT) have not yet been reported.",
