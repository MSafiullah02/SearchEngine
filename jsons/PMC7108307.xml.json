            "text": "Gaining understanding of particle transport and deposition indoors has numerous engineering applications. There has been considerable interest over the past decade in exposure assessment of fine particles inhalation and its influence on public health. The anthrax mailing accidents following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have generated enormous concern in design and application of ventilation strategy for protecting indoor environment against the intentional release of biological agents. Phrases like aerobiological engineering or immune-building technology are coined recently to reflex the importance of studying aerosol behaviors indoors. Better understandings of the aerosol dynamics in terms of mixing time and dispersion rate are vital to decide the positioning of air toxic sensors which have became an important element for monitoring buildings (Gadgil et al., 2003). Improper placement of the sensors can impair the ability of the sensors to provide the first response decision. In addition, understanding aerosol dispersion and transport is very essential in the prevention of nosocomial transmission of airborne pathogens (Cole and Cook, 1998; Li et al., 2005). After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in South East Asia 2003, there is increasing research interest in studying transport and control of airborne bacteria or viruses in indoor environments (Beggs et al., 2005; Nicas et al., 2005) and in confined environment like flight cabinet (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005). While conducting in situ experiment can provide detailed information on microorganisms transport and survival in enclosed environments, potential danger and cost involved should be carefully considered. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides a very cost-effective way to perform parametric studies to investigate the microorganism dynamic behavior prior to full-scale experiments.",

The Eulerian method considers the particle phase as another continuum. Governing equations derived from the mass (species) conservation condition are solved to give details of the particle concentration field. However, some studies treated the particle phase as scalar species (no inertia) and the results should be inferred cautiously (Lu et al., 2005; Noakes et al., 2004). Gravitational settling was considered in some Eulerian CFD models (Murakami et al., 1992; Holmberg and Li, 1998; Zhao et al., 2004), nevertheless, the deposition rate in those studies was only estimated empirically or simply ignored. It has been shown that, in certain circumstances, ignoring the deposition flux may result in numerical instability problems. Theoretical model needs to be developed to evaluate deposition rate according to local turbulent flow condition.",

Under this framework, generally speaking, the flow field is obtained by applying Reynolds averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) turbulent models. The flow and other quantities obtained are ensemble-averaged components. Near-wall fluctuating velocities are highly anisotropic with the component normal to the wall substantially smaller than those in the other two directions. Proper treatment for the fluctuation components is critical to particle deposition modeling. However, many previous RANS approaches for indoor environments ignored this effect and lead to incorrect deposition rates.",

A number of Lagrangian simulations have been carried out for particle transport and deposition in ventilated single-zone room (Zhao et al., 2004), two-zone chamber (Lu et al., 1996) and multi-zone chamber (Chung, 1999). Unfortunately, the effect of turbulence on particle phase was overlooked in most of those models, even though the airflow fields were simulated with turbulence models. Recently, large eddy simulation (LES) has applied to simulate particle transport and deposition for simple single-zone geometries (B\u00e9ghein et al., 2005; Bouilly et al., 2005).",

To model particle deposition accurately, the grid should be able to resolve not only the turbulence field, but also the flow field properties along particle paths. If the near-wall boundary layer is not properly resolved, the predicted deposition rate may depart from the actual solution severely. In the present model, the near-wall turbulence is deliberately damped. If the near-wall cell center is out of the viscous sublayer, the normal velocity at the point may not be negligible and consequently the interpolated normal velocity at the particle position may be sufficiently large to drive the particle to impact onto the wall directly. Hence, the near-wall grid should be fine enough to resolve the important deposition boundary layer. Three different grid systems are tested and details of them are listed in Table 1\n. Taken into account of both computational resources requirement and result accuracy, grid system 2 with 181,976 hexahedral cells is chosen for the present simulation (Lai and Chen, 2007).",

It should be emphasized that the optimized turbulent kinetic energy in Eq. (8) still remains isotropic. There are several salient features of this hybrid scheme. The method can be conveniently applied to various conditions, as the modification to the model is minimal. The prediction of the normal Reynolds stress component is remarkably improved, thus it can result in a more reasonable particle deposition rate. On the other hand, the turbulent intensities in the rest two directions are underestimated undesirably. This under-estimation is unlikely to incur significant error when the particle deposition rate is the parameter of concern, as particle deposition is not directly affected by the rest two components and, the mean flow velocities in these two directions overwhelms the fluctuation counterparts.",

A noticeable observation is that the submicron particle concentration can achieve fairly uniform in just 300 s, and in 30 min the particle concentration is virtually homogeneous for the entire zone. The ultrafine particles exhibit similar dispersion characteristic to that observed for 0.3 \u03bcm particles (results not shown).

In case of non-uniform mixing, a useful parameter, the mixing time, is used to quantify the time needed to reach a well-mixed state. It is defined as the time at which the coefficient of variation becomes <10% permanently since the release of pollutant. Fig. 3\npresents the coefficients of variation of the three particle sizes. Inferring from the results, it can be shown that CV strongly depends on the particle size and airflow; small size and high airflow favor mixing. One thing should be noted is that the mixing characteristics of 0.3 and 1 \u03bcm are very close whereas very distinct difference can be observed for 1 and 7 \u03bcm particles. As the gravitational settling magnitude is a function of particle size with an exponent of 2, sedimentation influences the mixing and dispersion rates (Fig. 2) in a non-linear way; in the results presented, the distinct behavior of 7 \u03bcm particles is observed.",

            "text": "For Lagrangian model, the results presented are very different. Since particles are treated as a discrete and not a continuum phase, concentration contour does not exist. Another factor further complicates the issue is the computer resources required for Lagrangian model. Due to the current limitation of computational resources, almost all Lagrangian models inject particles momentarily and track the individual particle based on the forces exerted. Because of the transient in nature and the validity of the well mixed (discussed above), these pose limitation for presenting the results obtained from Lagrangian approach. In the literature, the parameter decay rate loss coefficient is often used to characterize the particle removal rate in an enclosure. The decay rate coefficient is derived from the mass balance principle where well-mixed condition is assumed. This has a significant implication on the application of particle decay rate coefficient for quantifying the fate of particles in a non-well-mixed enclosures and it must be used cautiously (Bouilly et al., 2005). Hence for Lagrangian framework, another common approach, which counts the number of particles remaining in the domain versus time, is adapted (B\u00e9ghein et al., 2005). The particle deposition fraction, \u03b7, is defined as(10)\u03b7=Nin-NoutNin,where N\nin and N\nout are the numbers of particles released at the inlet and the number of particles exited from the outlet, respectively. As observed in Fig. 4\n, the original EIM without correction over-predicts particle deposition rate noticeably, particularly for 0.3 and 1 \u03bcm particles at the high ventilation rate. The turbulent intensity is stronger for the high-velocity case. If the correction scheme is not applied, the original EIM tends to give more severe over-prediction for the high-velocity case. Generally, the deposition fractions predicted with the correction are closer to the semi-empirical equation (Lai and Nazaroff, 2000).",

            "text": "Thus far we have highlighted the main features of two models developed recently and results are presented separately. It is very valuable to quantify the simulation results by a same parameter. In Fig. 5\n, Eulerian and Lagrangian results for two airflow velocities are shown. Overall speaking, the results modeled by the two approaches agree well with each other; as the particle size increases, the deposition fraction increases. For submicron particles, the deposition fractions predicted by Lagrangian (without near-wall turbulent correction) is higher than those predicted with correction and Eulerian drift flux prediction follows. Deposition fraction for 0.45 m s\u22121 is also higher than the case of 0.225 m s\u22121. This is because for submicron particles, the deposition is significantly affected by turbulent diffusion and it is stronger for the high-velocity case. For supermicron particles scenario, the discrepancy between Eulerian and Lagrangian increases with particle size, however, is not significant. One thing should be noted is that as the particle size increases, the influence of the turbulent correction diminishes. These observations can be explained by the dominant fate mechanism for this size range of particles. As particle size increases, deposition by gravitational settling increases significantly and the other effect, i.e. turbulent diffusion, becomes less important. It must be careful when direct comparison is attempted to be made. As discussed above that the injection type for Eulerian is continuous while for Lagrangian, the injection is momentarily. For steady-state condition such as Eulerian model, the parameter deposition velocity can be used to quantify the deposition rate in a more rigorous way, while for Lagrangian framework, using deposition velocity as a parameter is not an obvious means. On the other hand, the deposition fraction cannot be used to quantify the deposition onto various orientated surfaces, however, it can be used to characterize both models.",

CFD has become a virtual tool for studying particle dynamics. We compared a new drift\u2013flux Eulerian and a modified Lagrangian models for a single-zone chamber geometry. One key feature of the drift\u2013flux model is to encapsulate external forces into the formulation and present the results in a continuous domain. Near-wall anisotropic turbulence correction is properly applied in the Lagrangian model. Inferring from the results, it is shown that non-corrected turbulent scheme over-predicts particle deposition significantly for submicron particles while supermicron particles are not sensitive to the correction scheme. The paper also highlighted the results obtained by Eulerian and Lagrangian models. The two models agree very well for submicron particles. As the size increases, the discrepancy increases moderately. It is not straightforward to conclude which model is better than the other as each model has its own fundamental assumptions imposed. The results shown here reveal that the two present models are comparable.",
