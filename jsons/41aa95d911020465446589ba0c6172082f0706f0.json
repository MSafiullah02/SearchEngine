            "text": "D iaphragmatic paralysis has been described in a few animals, including a pony, a dog, a llama, and 3 cats. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The condition can be hemilateral or bilateral, with bilateral showing more severe signs of respiratory distress. Diaphragmatic paralysis in animals and humans has been attributed to central or peripheral nervous system trauma or compression, degeneration of the phrenic nerves that innervate the diaphragm muscle, or myopathies. 2,4-6 Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis can be asymptomatic; however, animals or humans with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis typically show signs of respiratory distress and demonstrate a paradoxical abdominal respiratory pattern in which the abdominal musculature contracts inward on inspiration. [1] [2] [3] 6 Blood work can be unremarkable if an inflammatory condition is not present, but arterial blood gas samples might demonstrate the presence of alveolar hypoventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch with a respiratory acidosis, hypercapnea, hypoxemia, and metabolic compensation. 1, 3, 5, 6 These findings are not specific to the diaphragmatic paralysis condition. Diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis can be challenging to confirm. Diagnostic imaging used in animals and humans includes radiography, ultrasonography, and fluoroscopy. 3, 4, 6 Other diagnostic tools such as respiratory inductive plethysmography and pneumotachography, and electromyogram testing, have been utilized to confirm a diagnosis but are not commonly available to many veterinary practitioners. 1, 2, 6 Prognosis is dependent on the inciting cause of the diaphragmatic paralysis and whether the condition is hemilateral or bilateral.",

Reports in humans, dogs, and horses describe similar degenerative lesions as Wallerian degeneration or ''dying back'' neuropathies.

Currently, there are multiple proposed etiologies regarding these types of neuropathies in humans and animals and include inadequate transport of cellular products to the distal axons, inflammatory, nutritional, metabolic, toxic, and heritable conditions. 7,9 Ancillary testing and history essentially ruled out many disease processes as the etiology in these alpacas.

Minimal respiratory stress occurs during the fluoroscopic procedures because the alpacas are maintained in sternal recumbency and oxygen can be provided as needed during the procedure. Thoracic radiographs can be difficult to interpret as it is difficult to obtain consistent inhalation or exhalation images and inhumane to restrict breathing in order to adequately access diaphragm position. Hemiparalysis often causes a characteristic increases in the affected side that is easily observed on thoracic films. 4, 13 Ultrasound can be used but requires a skilled operator who is familiar with thoracic anatomy. Other diagnostic testing that can aid in diagnosing diaphragmatic paralysis in animals includes arterial blood gas measurements, respiratory inductive plethysmography and pneumotachography, nerve conduction studies, and electromyogram testing. 1,2,6 Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new tool for use in animals and might be helpful in evaluating nerve conduction abnormalities and localizing spinal cord lesions. 14 Prognosis for bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in alpacas appears guarded, particularly when both respiratory and neurologic deficits are observed. Medical treatment did not appear to result in direct improvement of diaphragmatic function, but vitamin E supplementation might have been beneficial in some animals. Supportive care with oxygen supplementation and stall rest in a low-stress and low-activity environment is recommended until the animal can develop a satisfactory abdominal and intercostal respiratory function to become stable or nerve regeneration occurs.
