First, relying solely on governments to provide outbreak information under formal international legal obligations proved a failure under the IHR.@ Although WHO still needed governments involved in global surveillance, the Organization wanted to be able to use epidemiological information from nongovernmental sources.64 Second, new information technologies, such as the Internet and e-mail, provided WHO with opportunities to mine non-govemniental sources of information in order to enhance global si~rveillance.~~ Prior to the IHR revision process, WHO had access to non-governmental sources of information but, in law and policy, was limited in how it could use them.

Whether the elevation of public health as a political priority because of SARS spills over to affect positively efforts to deal with other infectious clisease problems, such as antimicrobial resistance, also is uncertain.'\" SARS may cause governments to shift public health resources away from some exjsting problems toward SARS-related programs. As WHO indicated in connection with China, \"[mleasures may need to be found for sustaining China's present monumental effort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other priority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TI3, niay suffer in the long run.''ta The U.S. National Intelligence Council argued that SARS \"will not lead to a significant boost in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the corning years. Indeed, many countries are likely to view spending on diseases like SARS and HlV/AIDS as a zerosum game in the ~h o r t -t e r m . \" '~~ How much positive spill-over effect, if any, SARS-induced shifts produce for general public health is unknown. If responses to SARS create public health systems only tuned to severe epidemic diseases with high cross-border then post-Westphalian governance will risk becoming as irrelevant as the IHR became for today's infectious disease problems.",

The reliance on GHG mechanisms to address SARS also underscores that traditional internationalization of public health through the Westphalian approach failed to work.
