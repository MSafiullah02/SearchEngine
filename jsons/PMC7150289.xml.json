Staphylococcus aureus occasionally causes superficial auricular cellulitis, which is less extensive than that of streptococcal origin.

Other affected structures may include the eye, the cardiovascular system, small and large peripheral joints and the middle and inner ear (Lucente 1995, Staats 2002, Gergely 2004). The aetiology is unknown; however, the pathogenesis is most likely autoimmune (Gergely et al 2004). Signs and symptoms of RP of the auricle include auricular cellulitis, typically with a sudden onset of unilateral or bilateral auricular pain, tenderness, swelling and redness, with sparing of the lobules. The pain and redness usually disappear within 2\u20134 weeks but may recur. A definitive diagnosis of RP is made by biopsy of the affected cartilaginous tissue that demonstrates infiltration of the cartilage and perichondrial tissues with neutrophils and lymphocytes and loss of cartilaginous matrix. Mild cases may respond to symptomatic treatment with aspirin, indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Severe cases are initially treated with systemic corticosteroids with tapering of the dose in accordance with the clinical response. In very severe cases addition of an immunosuppressive agent such as cyclophosphamide is required.",

Often this infection is predisposed by moisture in the external ear canal such as in warm-moist climates or after bathing. Injury caused by attempts to clean or scratch an itching ear as in patients suffering from contact dermatitis (from earrings or earphones), allergic dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis is another common cause (Hirsch 1992). A variant of AOE is \u2018swimmer's ear\u2019, a condition caused by a combination of external ear canal trauma and humidity during the swimming season (Agius et al 1992). Signs and symptoms of AOE include mild to severe otalgia associated with purulent discharge from the external ear canal. Auricular movement or pressure on the tragus intensifies the pain. The otalgia can become extreme as the canal swells and becomes blocked. Appropriate treatment includes topical application of a combination of antibiotic and corticosteroid eardrops, instilled directly into the ear canal. Irrigation of the ear canal with either hydrogen peroxide or 70% alcohol can temporarily stop the pain and itching.",

            "text": "Necrotizing external otitis (NEO) is an infection which starts as an external otitis caused by P. aeruginosa and progresses into an osteomyelitis of the temporal bone (Sander 2001). This disease commonly occurs in elderly diabetic patients and occasionally in immunocompromised patients (Handzel and Halperin 2003). The disease spreads outside the external ear canal through the fissures of Santorini which are two slits located at the anterior cartilaginous external canal wall and the osseocartilaginous junction into the skull base. It is characterized by persistent severe otalgia, purulent otorrhea and granulation tissue in the external ear canal (Handzel and Halperin 2003). Pre-auricular and temporomandibular joint pain intensified by opening the mouth or by chewing may be present. Severe headache in the temporal or occipital areas may accompany the earache. The severity of the pain can give a clue to the diagnosis. In severe cases, facial nerve involvement may occur, indicating an invasive infection. Other cranial nerve palsies, such as IX, X, XI and XII, may also occur. Imaging evaluation by computed tomography (CT) usually demonstrates soft tissue infiltration and bone destruction (Guy et al 1991). Technetium99 bone-scan is usually positive and is highly sensitive to NEO. Treatment includes good control of the diabetes and prolonged therapy with an anti-pseudomonal antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin for at least 6 weeks in addition to local therapy for the otitis externa. Surgical debridement through a mastoidectomy approach is occasionally required to control the spread of the infection.",

            "text": "Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (RHS), also called herpes zoster oticus, is a herpes virus-3 infection (varicella-zoster virus infection which causes chickenpox and shingles) of the geniculate ganglion (facial nerve ganglion) (Kuhweide et al 2002). The virus spreads from the geniculate ganglion to the facial nerve and to the adjacent vestibulocochlear (XIII) nerve (Kuhweide et al 2002). The syndrome consists of unilateral facial paralysis, severe ear pain on the same side as the infection, tinnitus, vertigo and herpetic blistering rash or vesicles on the pinna, external canal and sometimes the roof of the mouth, in the distribution of the sensory branches of the facial nerve. Other cranial nerves may be involved and some degree of meningeal inflammation may occur (Ko et al 2000). RHS is usually more painful than Bell's palsy. It is rare in healthy people and occurs more commonly in people with a weakened immune system, such as the elderly (Burke et al 1982). Diagnosis of RHS is based on the clinical symptoms and signs. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids and antiviral medications such as acyclovir and famciclovir reduces the symptoms and improves recovery (Morrow 2000, Kinishi 2001). Overall, chances of recovery are better if treatment is started within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. Certain degrees of hearing loss or facial paralysis may become permanent (Morrow 2000). Recovery may be complicated if the nerve grows back to the wrong areas (synkinesis); this may cause inappropriate responses, such as tearing when laughing or chewing (crocodile's tears). Some may start blinking when talking or eating.",

            "text": "Acute otitis media (AOM) is an infection of the middle ear cavity. AOM occurs most frequently in infants and children, particularly between the ages of 3 months and 3 years, although it can occur at any age. AOM usually follows or accompanies an upper respiratory infection (URI) or a reduced immune response with no special reason. AOM is the second most common childhood disease after URI. The first complaint is usually persistent, severe otalgia, which is often caused by an accumulation of fluid and pressure behind the tympanic membrane (TM). Other symptoms include hearing loss, fever, chills, irritability and a feeling of fullness and pressure in the affected ear. Spontaneous drainage of pus or a clear or bloody fluid from the middle ear is common, and may indicate perforation of the TM. An otoscopic examination reveals abnormal findings of the TM, including an erythematous and bulging TM, middle ear effusion, non-distinct anatomical middle ear landmarks, displaced or absent TM light reflex and decreased TM mobility on pneumatic otoscopy. The most common bacterial pathogen in AOM is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. These three organisms are responsible for more than 95% of all AOM cases with a bacterial aetiology. The most important factors in the pathogenesis of a middle ear infection are eustachian tube dysfunction and direct extension of infectious processes from the nasopharynx into the middle ear cleft. AOM is treated with painkillers and systemic antibiotics such as oral amoxicillin. Topical analgesics such as tetracaine applied by eardrops and nasal decongestants such as xylometazoline can be helpful. Antibiotic therapy relieves the symptoms, hastens resolution of the infection and reduces the chance for developing complications (such as mastoiditis or meningitis). Myringotomy (small incision of the TM) should be considered in cases of a bulging TM or a persistent earache.",

An upper respiratory tract infection can precede the ear manifestations. Pain is severe, starts suddenly, persists for 24\u201372 hours and is due to the TM blisters, which appear between the richly innervated outer epithelium and the middle fibrous layers of the TM (Woo 1992, Marais 1997). Bullae involving the TM may also extend towards portions of the external auditory canal immediately adjacent to the TM. Objective cochlear and vestibular involvement manifested by sensorineural or mixed-type hearing loss and vertigo have been reported in patients suffering from MB (Eliashar et al 2004). Treatment includes analgetic and antibiotic therapy such as azithromycin which is efficacious against the major known pathogens causing MB.",

The ET enables normal fluids to drain from the middle ear, and has an important role in equalizing the pressure in the middle ear when atmospheric pressure of ambient air shifts. Acute obstruction of the ET, mainly in cases of URI, may cause otalgia. This is especially common in small children, whose ET is naturally shorter and more horizontal. ET obstruction also occurs when there is an increase of postnasal drainage (PND) or allergy (Derebery 1997, Grimmer 2005). As the PND drains posteriorly into the nasopharynx around the opening of the ET, it gets irritated and swollen and eventually becomes blocked on one or both sides. When this happens, surrounding tissue absorbs the air in the affected tube, creating a vacuum, which causes the differences in pressure to pull the tympanic membrane inward, the result being a sensation of fullness and pain. Hearing can be slightly impaired and the ears can feel blocked or stuffed. To improve ET function, topical vasoconstrictors such as xylometazoline may be instilled into each nasal cavity.",

When a sudden increase in the ambient pressure occurs, air must move from the nasopharynx into the middle ear in order to maintain equilibrium on both sides of the TM. In cases of eustachian tube dysfunction, the pressure in the middle ear is below the ambient pressure, and the relative negative pressure in the middle ear results in retraction of the TM and transudation of blood from vessels. Very severe and sudden pressure differences may rupture the TM, causing bleeding in the middle ear with severe earache and conductive hearing loss. A perilymphatic fistula through the oval or round windows can occur, causing sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. Barotrauma commonly occurs with altitude changes, such as in descent of an airplane, deep sea diving, scuba diving or driving in the mountains (Mirza and Richardson 2005). Otalgia is the most common complaint of scuba divers and is experienced at some point by almost every diver (Clenney and Lassen 1996). Some divers call it the \u2018ear squeeze\u2019. A person with an acute URI or allergic rhinitis should be advised to abstain from diving. Topical application of a nasal vasoconstrictor such as xylometazoline before any activity associated with descent and pressure changes can prevent barotrauma.",

            "text": "The trigeminal nerve is the main facial sensory supply. The ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) divisions of the trigeminal nerve provide sensation to the mucosa of the sinonasal cavity. These nerve branches terminate as extensive uncovered nerve terminal endings next to the basal cells of the nasal epithelium (Baraniuk 2001). Nasal pain is mediated by A\u03b4 fibres\u2014the fast-responding, primarily mechanoreceptive pain fibres\u2014and by C fibres\u2014the slower, unmyelinated fibres associated with a duller pain from mechanothermal and chemosensory stimulation (Baraniuk 2001). Recent theories of sinonasal pain from \u2018contact points\u2019 or pressure from sinus inflammation are based upon substance P (SP) release from trigeminal sensory neurons located in the nasal mucosa (Stammberger 1988, Chow 1994, Clerico 1995, Clerico 1997). This may be accompanied by the release of various other neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which appear to be involved in the inflammatory cascade (Baraniuk 2001). The local stimulation of the trigeminal fibres leads to both a painful orthodromic and an antidromic response, typified by vasodilatation and hypersecretion (Stammberger 1988, Baraniuk 2001). Despite this frequently cited mechanism for contact point sinonasal pain, it is poorly documented and highly controversial (Abu-Bakra 2001a, Abu-Bakra 2001b, Jones 2004).",

People with acute rhinosinusitis have a significantly lower pain and sensory detection threshold in their sinus regions when compared to a healthy control group (Meltzer 2004, Benoliel 2006). Sinus pain caused by inflammation induced by infection (bacterial or viral) or allergic rhinosinusitis occurs when exudate blocks the sinus ostium and exerts pressure which stimulates local trigeminal nerve fibres. The local release of proinflammatory and proalgesic mediators is an early mechanism (this is probably as important as the pressure).",

Other authors have adopted this concept to explain how pain might be induced by anatomical variants such as a concha bullosa (a pneumatized middle turbinate) or a pneumatized superior turbinate touching the septum (Morgenstein 1980, Blaugrund 1989, Goldsmith 1993, Clerico 1994, Clerico 1996). According to the IHS, the assumptions related to certain otolaryngologic conditions often considered to induce headaches have not been sufficiently validated. These include deviation of the nasal septum, hypertrophy of turbinates and atrophy of sinus membranes. However, mucosal contact point pain is defined in the IHS appendix; see Table 6.7\n(Olesen et al 2004).",

Common causes of sinus barotraumas include allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, nasal deformity, nasal polyposis, acute URI and chronic irritation (such as smoking, diesel fumes, chemicals and prolonged use of decongestant nasal drops). Symptoms include pain in the area of the affected sinus or in the upper teeth (when the maxillary sinus is involved) and nose bleeding. The frontal sinuses are the most frequently affected, because the nasofrontal duct draining the frontal sinus is longer and more tortuous. A \u2018reverse squeeze\u2019 occurs during ascent, when air in the sinus expands without any ability to escape and is extremely painful. The situation is self-limiting, because air is gradually absorbed into the tissues lining the sinuses. When a sinus squeeze occurs, a slow ascent to the surface that generally alleviates most of the pain is recommended. Because the sinus may be filled with blood, the patient is at high risk of developing consequent sinusitis. Antibiotic therapy along with oral and nasal topical decongestants to promote drainage is recommended. Persistence of severe pain with no signs of acute rhinosinusitis may be treated by a short course of steroids. Diving is not recommended for patients with URI.",

Recent publications have stated that \u2018sinus\u2019 headache patients, at least those with no obvious signs of infection, have a 58\u201388% incidence of a migraine-type headache (Perry 2004, Schreiber 2004).

            "text": "The reason for the high rate of sinus headache patients misdiagnosed by their physicians is related to the pathophysiology of migraine and to the nature of nasal pain. The neurovascular theory of migraine implicates the nervous system as being the initiator of the process, and the blood vessel involvement occurring as a consequence of the neuronal process. This migraine model identifies the starting point in the central nervous system followed by a sensitization of the peripheral neurons of the trigeminal nerve, including those which supply sensation to the meninges. When the peripheral early phase is not treated in time, central sensitization at the level of the caudal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve occurs, with concomitant repetitive firing of the involved neurons, and pain in the distribution of the ophthalmic (V1) and/or maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve. These nerves also provide sensation to the mucosa of the sinonasal cavity and are involved in the neurobiology of primary sinonasal pain. The early sensitization phase is accompanied by cutaneous allodynia (pain induced by stimulation which is normally non-painful) in the majority of patients (80%), and often occurs in the distribution of V1 and V2 (Cady and Schreiber 2004). This may include stimulation of the nose, such as while breathing cold air. A migraine attack may include secondary nasal symptoms, which are probably mediated by stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system via the superior salivatory nucleus of the facial nerve (VII); this reflex activation is extensively discussed in Chapters 9 and 10chapter 9chapter 10. A report on patients with sinus headaches which fulfil the migraine criteria demonstrated that 84% reported sinus pressure, 82% sinus pain, 63% nasal congestion, 40% rhinorrhea, 38% watery eyes and 27% \u2018itchy\u2019 nose (Schreiber et al 2004). Occasionally, sinonasal disease or nasal allergy can play a role in triggering migraine which may respond to nasal steroids or to leukotriene antagonists (Cady and Schreiber 2004). The appearance of \u2018neurogenic rhinitis\u2019 along with a sinus headache in patients with migraine is often misunderstood and contributes to misdiagnosis.",

Swelling of this region can compromise the airway. Most Ludwig's angina infections are odontogenic, usually from the second or third mandibular molar. Other causes include peritonsillar or parapharyngeal abscesses, mandibular fracture, oral lacerations or piercing, and rarely submandibular sialadenitis. Predisposing factors include dental caries, recent dental treatment, systemic illnesses (such as diabetes mellitus), malnutrition, alcoholism, compromised immune system (such as AIDS) and organ transplantation. The term \u2018Ludwig's angina\u2019 is reserved for infections meeting the following five criteria:1A cellulitic process (not an abscess) of the submandibular space;2Involvement of only the submandibular space, although this might be bilateral and spread into secondary spaces;3The finding of gangrene with foul serosanguineous fluid on incision, but no frank purulence;4Involvement of the fascia, muscle and connective tissue, with sparing of the glandular tissue; and5Direct spread of infection rather than spread by lymphatics.\n",

            "text": "The most common microbes involved are usually Streptococcus species and oral anaerobic bacteria. Symptoms include painful neck swelling, tooth pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnea, fever and malaise. Ludwig's angina is characterized by a brawny induration of the mouth floor and suprahyoid region (bilaterally), with elevation or protrusion of the tongue, thus potentially obstructing the airway. Other signs include a tender, firm swelling in the submental and anterior neck without fluctuance, tachypnea, stridor, trismus, muffled or \u2018hot potato\u2019 voice and drooling. The white blood cell count is high with a \u2018shift to the left\u2019. Airway management is the primary therapeutic concern. Airway control by endotracheal intubation is mandatory. Therapy includes intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and occasionally drainage of the swelling through a cervical incision with placement of drains. Dental treatment may be needed to treat the initiating tooth infection. Complications such as sepsis and descending necrotizing mediastinitis may occur through the retropharyngeal space and carotid sheath.",
