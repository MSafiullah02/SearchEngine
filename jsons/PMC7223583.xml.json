            "text": "Noroviruses are a major causative agent of acute gastroenteritis, with high prevalence across the globe [1]. Norovirus outbreaks in public spaces, such as kindergartens and primary or secondary schools, are generally associated with low hygiene levels and contaminated food or water [2\u20134]. Noroviruses belong to the family Caliciviridae and have three open reading frames (ORFs) in their genome. ORF1 encodes a large nonstructural protein (Ntpase, p22, VPg, 3CLpro and RdRp), ORF2 encodes the major structural capsid protein (VP1), and ORF3 encodes a minor structural protein (VP2) [5]. Based on the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein, noroviruses have been classified into 10 genogroups (GI~GX) and approximately 53 genotypes so far [6, 7]. Of the genogroups, GI, GII and GIV can be found in human infections, with genogroup GII being the most common [8]. The GII.4[P4] genotype has been reported in many countries and is the prevalent strain in most outbreaks and human infections [9\u201311]. Previous reports have shown that GII.17[P17] became the main epidemic genotype of norovirus in China, in 2014 [11\u201314]. GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] have also been found in the coastal environment and in seafood in Korea. These two genotypes share a close phylogenetic relationship with GII.17[P17]. However, these genotypes are found infrequently in human infections, and this might be associated with a unique histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding site involved in host susceptibility and the presence of decoy glycan receptors in the human gastrointestinal tract that prevents binding of the virus [15, 16].",

The emerging virus can replace the old ones and cause new infections and outbreaks every two to four years, as has been observed with GII.4(Sydney)[P4(New Orleans)] and GII.2[P16] [19]. In addition, other recombinant strains, such as GII.6[P7], GII.13[P16] and GII.4[P31], have been reported in outbreaks and environments [20\u201323]. Although those genotypes have not caused severe outbreaks, studying these strains has helped us to obtain more information on the genetic diversity and gene constellation of noroviruses.",

            "text": "GI and GII noroviruses are the most important viral cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans globally. A large proportion of the population is infected with noroviruses via contact with contaminated food, water, and environment every year [17, 18, 26]. Various GII genotypes have been recognized in a number of outbreaks, including GII.4[P4], GII.16[P16], and GII.17[P17] [9, 11, 20]. Owing to the high frequency of genetic exchange at the ORF1 and ORF2 junction, multiple recombinant strains have emerged and caused outbreaks, such as GII.4[P31] and GII.2[P16] [19, 27, 28]. Previous studies have shown that GII.17[P17] was the most prevalent genotype in 2014 in China [11, 13]. Genotypes GII.17[P17], GII.13[P13], and GII.21[P21] belong to a separate genetic lineage in the phylogenetic tree[29, 30]. Unlike GII.4[P4] and GII.2[P16], which have caused large outbreaks and infections around the world, human infections with genotypes GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] have rarely been reported. Differences in the HBGA binding sites of GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] variants might contribute to the sporadic rate of infection [15]. Hence, GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] genotypes are still evolving and spreading at a lower rate. Although these genotypes might infect humans only sporadically, it is still useful to study the genetic diversity of these norovirus genotypes.",

Whole-genome sequencing of recombinant strains is important for vaccine development strategies and studies of viral evolution. Hence, we determined the genome sequences of GII.13[P21] recombinant strains isolated in the city of Changsha, China. From the epidemiological information, although only visitors of the commercial park suffered from gastroenteritis, all food and water samples from the park were free of contamination, indicating that the source of the contamination might have been direct contact with infected persons or contaminated environments. Based on the genetic and sequence data, we conclude that the outbreak involved multiple genotypes, including GII.4[P4], GII.2[P16], and GII.17[P17], which have been reported frequently in previous outbreaks [10]. These results reveal that the prevalent genotypes continue to infect humans. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1 and ORF2 segments showed that the recombinant strains belong to different branches. These results suggest that sequences in these recombinant strains might have originated in other countries neighboring China or that the strains might have evolved from local strains that have not been detected in the environment before. The high degree of sequence similarity between the two GII.13[P21] recombinant strains indicated that the infection probably had a common source or was spread via human-to-human transmission. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that members of genotypes GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] are closely related to each other [15]. GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] are continually observed in Korea and Thailand [13]. The break point identified in this study was located in ORF1 segment, at the same position as reported previously in other recombinant strains [23]. Based on these findings, it is suggested that recombination between these genotypes might occur more easily than with other genotypes.",

The role of substitutions in the B, N and T loops of the P domain, including N294S, N309S and V394Q, which are associated with adaptation of the HBGA binding site, needs to be clarified in future research. TheT135A and K139R substitutions in the ORF1 sequence and the V541A substitution in ORF2 sequences may have no influence on the structure of the binding pocket. Although the sporadic norovirus genotypes do not cause serious epidemic worldwide, unlike GII.2[P16] and GII.4[P4], due to these special binding sites, human infections are associated with severe vomiting and diarrhea.
