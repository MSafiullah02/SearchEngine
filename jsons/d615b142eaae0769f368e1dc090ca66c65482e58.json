Spatially structured stochastic models can capture these important features of disease dynamics, thereby allowing a broader exploration of interventions. Here we develop a stochastic model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission amongst an interconnected group of population centres representing counties, municipalities and districts (collectively, \"counties\"). The model is parameterized with demographic, epidemiological, testing, and travel data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that the local strategy results in far fewer person-days of closure but only slightly more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, even under assumptions of high inter-county travel. However, both cases and person-days lost to closure rise significantly when county triggers are not coordinated by the province and when testing rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that phased plans for re-opening economies on the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider preceding larger-scale re-openings with coordinated local re-openings.",

Our objective is to develop a spatiallystructured stochastic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, testing, and school and workplace closure in order to address three questions: (1) Are closures best lifted at the scale of an entire province or on a county-by-county basis? (2) Does coordination of testing protocols and re-opening criteria between counties improve outcomes? (3) How well can a spatially phased approach work in the early stages of the epidemic? We use our model to determine the timing and organizational scale at which school and workplace re-opening strategies can minimize both the number of infections and person-days lost to closures, during the late-stage and early-stage epidemic.

Symptomatic individuals are tested for SARS-CoV-2 and their status becomes ascertained with some probability per day. The infection transmission probability in a county depends on the number of contacts in schools and workplaces-which are reduced by closures-and on contacts in other settings not affected by closures, such as homes. Transmission also depends on how effectively closures reduce transmission, and the extent to which population density drives transmission.",

Each individual travels from their home county to another county for the day with some probability that is reduced if schools and workplaces are closed in the destination county.

Our model dynamics are characterized by two distinct regimes (Fig. 1a,c) . In highly-populated counties, COVID-19 is endemic throughout the time horizon of the simulation. However, in counties with lower populations, cases blink in and out during the year, as infections jump between counties through travel. The infection patterns appear qualitatively similar under both strategies (Fig. 1a,c) , but closure patterns are very different, with most counties being closed most of the time under the global strategy ( Fig. 1b,d) .",

When the trigger prevalence is very high (i.e. an extreme scenario where decision-makers re-open or re-close for a prevalence of 1,000 confirmed positive cases per 100,000), a high proportion of the population becomes infected, since school and workplace closures are rarely sustained in either strategy after the initial 50-day province closure. At the other extreme of the lowest trigger prevalence, both strategies minimize infections by maintaining closures for the majority of the year. However, intermediate values of the trigger prevalence represent a \"sweet spot\" for the local strategy, where it outperforms the global strategy in terms exhibiting significantly fewer person-days of closure at the cost of a relatively small increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The local strategy can accomplish this because it affords flexibility to enact closures only in areas with continuing active outbreaks-primarily more populous counties with higher epidemic spread rates. We identify an optimal trigger prevalence as the trigger prevalence that allows significant reductions in person-days lost to closure, but only permits cases to increase by 1% compared to its minimum value across all values of the trigger prevalence (blue dashed lines, Fig. 2 ).",

The rise in person-days lost to closure is larger than the rise in infections. This occurs because renewed outbreaks in counties that lift closures prematurely are exported infections to neighbouring counties. This, in turn, necessitates additional closures in those counties and increases the number of person-days lost to closure (Fig. 3b ). This emphasizes how tight coordination can be beneficial from both public health and economic perspectives. Lack of coordination in testing is also problematic (Fig. 3c,d) . As between-county variation in the testing rate for symptomatic individuals increases, the mean and 85 % quantile of proportion infected and person-days lost to closure increase in most of the model stochastic realizations.",

Interestingly, the relative performance of the local and global strategies depends very little on the extent to which transmission probabilities are driven by population size, i.e., whether mass action incidence function or standard incidence function is a better approximation (SI Appendix, Fig. 2 ). The only exception is when population density has no effect on epidemic spread (pure standard incidence), in which case local and global strategies perform similarly because the initial 50day province-wide closure is effective enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in all counties. Similarly, the relative performance of the two strategies is not strongly affected by doubling our baseline travel rates (SI Appendix, Fig. 3 ).

We found that the modified local strategy could outperform the baseline local strategy under specific conditions for trigger prevalence and testing rates (Fig. 4) . In particular, the trigger prevalence must be reduced compared to our baseline analysis (Fig. 4a) , such that counties are closed as soon as a few cases are detected (Fig. 4c) . The optimal trigger prevalence for the modified local strategy increases exponentially with the testing probability (from 6 to 120 positive active cases in a city the size of Ottawa), meaning that counties can apply less stringent triggers only if their testing rates are very high and find more cases (Fig. 4c) . Testing of asymptomatic individuals is not included in our baseline analysis, but might occur under high testing capacity and effective contact tracing, and would permit a higher trigger prevalence and reduced person-days closed under the modified local strategy (Fig. 4b) by limiting epidemic growth to the most populous counties. However, given the initial short supply of test kits and long testing turnaround times that characterized Ontario and many other jurisdictions, the testing rate for symptomatic individuals probably remained below the required 0.1/day during the early epidemic in Ontario. Sensitivity analysis in the early epidemic (Fig. 4b) additionally shows that the benefit of fewer person-days closed under the local strategy declines when closures begin after many thousands of people are already infected, when travel is high, or if initial infections are concentrated in cities. Taken together, these results suggest that the modified local strategy of omitting the 50-day province-wide closure could significantly outperform the baseline local strategy early in the initial epidemic only with prompt mitigation, moderate-to-high testing rates, and very low trigger prevalence (a scenario resembling the South Korean control strategy). This finding reiterates public health consensus that early and aggressive action in the early stages of a pandemic, and also potentially during second waves, could minimize both infections and total person-days of closure.",

Nonlinear interaction between human and natural systems is pervasive [24] , and epidemiological systems are no exception [6, 46] . Behavioural feedback during the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested through (1) physical distancing to minimize individual infection risk in response to rising case reports [39] , and (2) pushback against lockdowns on account of economic impacts or perceived restrictions on civil liberties. An evidence-informed and coordinated approach to lifting lockdowns in less densely populated areas first, such as the one we propose, might have the added benefit of improving compliance to measures in populations that perceive province-wide closure to cover a needlessly large section of the population.

At the start of each day, each individual in county j travels to county k for the day with probability m jk , in which case they experience any transmission events that occur there. At the end of the day, they return back to county j. The values of the travel matrix M = [m jk ] were obtained from survey data [1] spanning 39% of Ontario inhabitants, of whom 25% worked outside their census division. We assumed individuals not surveyed travel half as often as commuters but exhibit similar movement patterns, since centers of work also tend to be centers of shopping and recreation, arriving at an aggregate daily travel probability of 15% per day. Infected individuals are less likely to travel by a factor r = 0.19 (i.e. 19% less likely to travel), since 81% of reported COVID-19 cases are mild [11] . Individuals who test positive are less likely to travel by a factor \u03b7 = 0.8 [19, 41] , with travel by I, K individuals reduced by (1 \u2212 \u03b7)(1 \u2212 r). Additionally, each individual's travel probability to a closed county is reduced by a factor , since fewer individuals travel to a county when its schools and workplaces are closed. 5.

We assign each newly infected individual to be a super-spreader with probability s = 0.2 [30] and denote super-spreading (non-super-spreading ) individuals with the subscript s (e.g., A s , I s ) (ns, resp.). Super-spreaders infect others with a probability that is (1\u2212s)/s times higher than non-superspreaders. Daily testing probabilities improved over the the first 30 days of province-wide closures as processing time declined from 10 days to a steady-state level of 3 days [36] . To model this, we assumed daily testing probabilities increase from 0.3\u03c4 I initially to \u03c4 I by day 30 after the 50th positive case is detected. Low coordination can cause the testing probability of infected persons to vary among counties. Physical distancing through closures or behavioural changes can reduce the probability of transmission by up preventing a fraction of all contacts. Closure C j (t) (see below) of schools and workplaces in county j can be applied and lifted over time and affect a fraction w of all contacts. We take w = 0.45 based on time use data for time spent at schools, workplaces, and other institutions that can be mandated to close [9] . The remaining time spent, 1 \u2212 w, is in settings such as homes and social gatherings. We assumed that individuals reduce their contacts in proportion to the number of confirmed cases reported in their county by a factor 1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03c9P + j /P j ), where P + j = P AK j +P IK j .
