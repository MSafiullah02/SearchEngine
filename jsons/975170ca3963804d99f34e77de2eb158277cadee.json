            "text": "A data set consisting of twenty-eight anatomical characters scored for twenty-eight terminal taxa representing the world fauna of Signiphoridae was analysed using parsimony and compatibility methods. The Coccophaginae (Aphelinidae) and the Azotinae (Aphelinidae) were used as outgroups to establish polarity of character state changes. Relationships of Signiphoridae to other Chalcidoidea are discussed. Several multistate characters were treated in the parsimony analyses either as unordered or as ordered into transformation series using additive binary coding, which in some cases drastically reduced the number of equally parsimonious solutions. Monophyly of Signiphoridae is supported by seven synapomoryhies. Four genera, Chartocerus, Thysanus, Clytina and Signiphora, are recognized within Signiphoridae based on synapomorphies. Rozanoviella syn.n. and Kerrichiella syn.n. are synonymized under Signiphora. Species of Signiphora are further assigned to four species groups, three of which are demonstrably monophyletic. Nine species or subspecies are transferred to Chartocerus from Signiphora (australicus comb.n., australiensis comb.n., australiensis orbiculatus comb.n., beethoveni comb.n., corvinus comb.n., funeralis comb.n., reticulata comb.n., ruskini comb.n., thusanoides comb.n.), one species to Thysanus from Signiphora (melancholicus comb.n.), and one species to Signiphora from Kerrichiella (coleoptratus c0mb.n.). A key to genera of Signiphoridae and species groups of Signiphora is presented. A diagnosis, relevant nomenclatural history, and a list of included species are given for each genus and species group, and the biology and distribution of each is summarized.",

If Correspondence Dr James Woolley, Department of Entomology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, U.S.A. one consults the major treatments of the superfamily in the literature, one can find a plethora of family and subfamily classifications. Major nomenclatural changes often have been proposed with little or no justification beyond a statement of the form: 'this group seems to be related to . . .'. I agree with Heraty & Darling (1984) , that this unfortunate situation can be resolved only by careful study of definable lineages, or monophyletic groups in the sense of Hennig (1966) . Once we have learned to recognize and characterize monophyletic lineages, we can begin to construct a natural classification of Chalcidoidea.",

Various workers treated the group as a family, or as a subfamily in the Encyrtidae, Aphelinidae or Eulophidae. The group was divided into from one to seven genera and a variety of generic schemes were proposed. Particularly troublesome has been the use of two different family names. The first family-group name was Signiphorinae, erected by Howard (1894) to contain Signiphora Ashmead (1880) . Peck (1951) synonymized Signiphora Ashmead under the older name Thysanus Walker (1840) and changed the family name to Thysanidae. This course was followed by most (but not all) workers until Rozanov (1965) presented a detailed argument for maintaining Thysanus and Signiphora as distinct. Following Rozanov (1965) most (but not all) used the family name Signiphoridae. A detailed account of this nomenclatural matter is presented in Woolley (1986) .",

Revisions for New World Signiphora and of the world species of Thysanus and Clytina Erdos are nearly complete. In connection with this work, I reviewed the world species. Study of Neotropical Signiphora, in particular, presented certain problems for classification. Two groups of Neotropical species did not seem to fit into any of the genera as previously defined. One group seemed to be intermediate between Rozanoviella Subba Rao and Signiphora. Another group seemed to be similar to, but distinct from, Rozanoviella as previously defined. The genus Kerrichiella Rozanov apparently was related to, but distinct from, Rozanoviella and the two groups of species just mentioned. These and other problems prompted a phylogenetic analysis of the entire family. The objectives of the study were fourfold: (1) to analyse the morphology of signiphorids and determine the relationships of the group to other Chalcidoidea, (2) to evaluate the evidence for monophyly of the Signiphoridae, (3) to evaluate the existing classifications of signiphorids from a phylogenetic perspective, (4) to incorporate into the classification previously unstudied Neotropical species.",

As discussed in detail by Gauld & Mound (1982) , students of parasitic Hymenoptera and certain other insect groups often find homoplasy (parallelisms or reversals) in phylogenetic analyses. The studies reported here are no exception. Gauld & Mound (1982) , Throckmorton (1965) and others speculated on the evolutionary phenomena that may result in lineages characterized by frequent parallelisms and reversals. These authors provided some recommendations for analysis under various conditions. The analysis that follows was complicated by homoplastic data. Several methods were used in an attempt to sort out the reliable indicators of phylogenetic relationship. I use the terminology of Gibson (1985 Gibson ( , 1986 ) for thoracic structures. Mesosoma refers to thorax and propodeum. Tergal numbering refers to metasomal terga: T1 is the tergum immediately posterior to the propodeum, T7 bears the spiracles, and so forth. Numbering of sterna refers to metasomal sterna: in females the posterior-most sternum (hypopygium) is S6, in males the posterior-most sternum is S8.",

For example, Compere & Annecke (1961) mention the expanded mesopleuron found in both Coccobius Ratzeburg (Aphelinidae) and encyrtids. Gibson (personal communication) determined that the expanded mesopleuron of Coccobius consists of enlarged acropleuron, as found in many eupelmids and all tanaostigmatids and encyrtids. However, this configuration of the acropleuron is only rarely found in aphelinids and probably represents a convergent modification of internal musculature due to selection for jumping ability (Gibson, 1986) . A convincing case for a close relationship of Encyrtidae and Aphelinidae has yet to be made. Domenichini (1954) made a significant contribution to the understanding of the affinities of Signiphoridae by analysing the structure of Thysanus and Chartocerus in some detail and comparing various aspects of signiphorid anatomy with that of Encyrtidae and Aphelinidae. In particular, Domenichini (1954) directed his attention to the thorax. He found little morphological evidence to support a close relationship between the Encyrtidae and Signiphoridae, except for the lack of notauli as discussed above. He did find certain similarities in structure between the Aphelinidae and Signiphoridae, the most notable of which was an undivided prepectus continuing across the venter between the prosternum and ventral mesepisternum (sensu Gibson, 1986) . However, the ventral portion of the prepectus is broadly fused with the ventral mesepisternum in all signiphorids. Yashnosh (1976) discusses both a 'divided' and an 'undivided' prepectus in Aphelinidae , but my Historically, the Signiphoridae have been considered to be closely related to two families in the Chalcidoidea, the Encyrtidae and the Aphelinidae. Ashmead (1900) first placed the subfamily Signiphorinae in the Encyrtidae and this placement was followed by many authors (Schmiedeknecht, 1909; Girault, 1913a Girault, , 1915 Girault, , 1916a Girault, , 1929 Brkthes, 1914; Malenotti, 1918; Crawford, 1913; Richards, 1935; Ferrikre, 1953; Yoshimoto, 1965; Riek, 1970; Gordh, 1979) . However, none of these authors presented a detailed justification for the union of the two groups, or discussed morphological similarities between the Signiphoridae and Encyrtidae that might set them apart from other Chalcidoidea. On the other hand, Howard (1895) placed Thysanus in the subfamily Aphelininae, a scheme that was then followed by several workers (Dalla Torre, 1898; Mercet, 1912; Girault, 1913b; Ashmead, 1904; Schmiedeknecht, 1909) until Mercet (1917) brought Thysunus into the 'Signiphorinos' . Kurdjumov (1916) placed his genus Xana in the Aphelininae; Xana was then transferred to the Signiphoridae by Nikol'skaya (1950) . Most recent authors have treated the Signiphoridae at the family level although Gordh (1979) reduced both the Aphelinidae and Signiphoridae to subfamily status and included them in the Encyrtidae.",

            "text": "The Encyrtidae have been regarded as a member of a lineage that includes the Tanaostigmatidae and the Eupelmidae (Trjapitsyn, 1977; LaSalle, 1987) . These groups are characterized (with the exception of male Eupelminae) by a convex and enlarged part of the mesopleuron that Gibson (1986) called the acropleuron. LaSalle (1987) provided an explicit hypothesis for the rnonophyly of a lineage composed of the Encyrtidae, Eupelmidae and Tanaostigmatidae, based on proposed synapomorphies. He also provided evidence that Tanaostigmatidae and Encyrtidae together form a monophyletic lineage, and the relationship of these taxa is further discussed in terms of apomorphic characters by LaSalle & Noyes (1985) . Gibson (personal communication) believes that Eupelmidae is probably a grade composed of at least three monophyletic lineages. In any case, Encyrtidae are characterized by a number of synapomorphies including anterior migration of the cerci studies indicate that in many aphelinids the prepectus is fused with the ventral mesepisternum as in signiphorids. The prepectus/mesepisternal complex of Aphelinidae requires further study, now underway in my laboratory. In addition, the prepectus of signiphorids is connected by an internal apodeme to the pronotum but in the aphelinids the prepectus is connected by a different apodeme to the mesoscutum (Domenichini, 1954) . Another similarity between aphelinids and signiphorids mentioned by Domenichini (1954) was the juxtaposition of the posterior margin of the mesotrochantinal plate (sensu Gibson, 1986) with the anterior margin of the metasternum in the signiphorids and aphelinids, whereas in encyrtids, eupelmids and tanaostigmatids these two sclerites are separated by a wide, membranous area. Further, he noted that the structure of the mesopleuron is very different in the three families. In encyrtids, the acropleuron is large and convex and both the mesepisternum and mesepimeron are quite reduced (Gibson, 1986) . In general, in Aphelinidae the acropleuron is a small anterodorsal region of the mesopleuron and the mesepisternum and mesepimeron are subequal and subrectangular. The mesopleuron has a similar configuration in Signiphoridae. The acropleuron is not greatly enlarged, the mesepimeron is subrectangular, and the upper and lower mesepisterna both have a ventral orientation (ac, eps2, epm2: Fig. 3 ). In summary, Domenichini (1954) recommended that the three groups continue to be recognized as distinct families. Quezada et al. (1973) presented new evidence for their view that the Signiphoridae are more closely related to the Aphelinidae than to any other group of Chalcidoidea. In particular, the genus Aphytis Howard was compared to signiphorids. Among the points of similarity noted were a reduced number of funicular segments and an undivided club in the antenna. Several unusual attributes of the mesosoma of Signiphoridae were believed to have counterparts in Aphytis. In Signiphoridae the metanotum bears a median sclerite set off by two oblique sutures and a small anteromedial apodeme. The mesosoma is also characterized by a 'relatively long propodeum with a cut-off triangular median salient' (Quezada et al., 1973) . The anteromedial apodeme is present in Aphytis, but in Aphytis and all other Aphelinidae that I have examined, if analogous medial areas are present in the metanotum and propodeum, they are set off from lateral areas by a difference in sculpture or convexity, not by sulci as in Signiphoridae (see also discussion for character 9 below).",

The first is a broad union of the metasoma and mesosoma and the modification of the first tergum (petiole of most chalcidoids) to a transverse dorsal sclerite at the base of the gaster. As noted below (character ll), the first tergum is further modified in some Signiphoridae. However, the broad union of the mesosoma and metasoma is found in other chalcidoid groups, for example the Trichogrammatidae and some genera of Encyrtidae and Mymaridae. Broad union of the mesosoma and metasoma usually is accompanied by the extension of the endophragma into the metasoma, a condition found in both Signiphoridae and Aphelinidae. A second characteristic common to many Aphelinidae (other than Eriaporinae, some Coccophagus spp., etc.) and Signiphoridae is the lack of a postmarginal vein on the forewing.",

In the Azotinae and Signiphoridae narrow apodemes project forward from the anterolateral angles of sterna 3-6 in females (sta: Fig. 4 ). Such apodemes have not been noted in other Chalcidoidea. Another possible synapomorphy involves the conformation of the terminal terga. In most Chalcidoidea the eighth and ninth terga have become fused to form a single sclerite, often referred to as the syntergum (Domenichini, 1953, and others) , which bears the cerci. Most workers have followed the interpretation of Snodgrass (1941) , as has Domenichini (1953) : because the ninth tergum normally bears the cerci in the Symphyta and Ichneumonoidea, the apparent eighth tergum of Chalcidoidea must represent the fusion of T8 and T9. The structure of these terga in Signiphoridae is unusual in that a separate sclerite posterior to the tergum bearing the cerci (T8) is found on the metasoma of all females (Fig. 13 ) and many males. The eighth tergum is continuous with the outer plates of the ovipositor ventrally and its dorsomedial portion is reduced to a more or less transverse strip which lies under T7 for the most part. The posterior sclerite is subtriangular or elongate in dorsal aspect. It is separated from T8 by a membranous area most easily visible in cleared whole mounts in which the apical portion of the abdomen has become somewhat distended during preparation. Since cerci are borne on T8, or at least are closely associated with the posterolateral margin of T8, the posterior sclerite in the Signiphoridae cannot be homologous with T9 in Symphyta and Ichneumonoidea. I follow Domenichini (1953) and refer to this sclerite as the epiproct, a neutral term which does not imply homology with similar sclerites in other taxa.",

In females of these genera the epiproct is subtriangular and the cerci are borne at the posterolateral margins of T8, as in Signiphoridae. The syntergum of male Ablerus and Azotus is very weakly sclerotized and almost membranous, although a pair of lateral, sclerotized regions are apparent in the anterodorsal region. I found no indication of a separate, sclerotized and well-defined epiproct in males of Ablerus and Azotus. Yashnosh (1976) and Compere (1955) state that a separate 'tenth tergum' is present in Aphelinus Dalman. My examination of Aphelinus material, including the slide-mount preparations of Mr. Compere, has shown this interpretation to be incorrect. In fact, T8 and T9 are clearly connected to form a syntergum in both sexes. However, the dorsomedial portions of the syntergum are set off by membranous areas dorsally and to some extent laterally. In dorsal aspect it may appear that an epiproct is present, but in lateral aspect the broad connection between the dorsomedial portion and the lateral portions (which bear the cerci) is clearly visible.",

Further complications arise if the taxonomic structure of the outgroup is poorly known (Maddison et al., 1984; Donoghue & Cantino, 1984) . This problem is present in this study due to the inability to precisely resolve the relationship of the Signiphoridae and Aphelinidae as discussed above. In particular, three characters used in the analysis of Signiphoridae are polymorphic in both Signiphoridae and Aphelinidae. The best solution was to include a sufficient number of outgroup taxa such that all possible combinations of these characters known to occur in the outgroup were represented. For this purpose, genera representing all of the aphelinid subfamilies were scored for the characters used in the signiphorid analysis. It was found that an outgroup consisting of two aphelinid taxa, the Coccophaginae and the Azotinae, was sufficient to encompass all observed combinations of character states in the outgroup.",

For example, can one assume that a mandible with two acute teeth must evolve through a mandible with three teeth to reach a mandible with four teeth? Such assumptions impose constraints on the interpretation of character state evolution, which may not be justified. One solution is offered in the PAUP package (discussed below), in which multistate characters can be treated as unordered series, that is, evolution from any particular state to any other is treated as equally likely and counted as a single step. The consequences of treating multistate characters as ordered or unordered series are explored below. Additive binary coding was also used with multistate characters to determine if different state changes showed more homoplasy than others. Additive binary coding was performed on the data set using the FACTOR algorithm contained in the PHYLIP package (discussed below). FACTOR requires that transformation series (character state trees) be specified a priori, thus the additive binary coded data set contains implicit assumptions about the evolution of particular states in multistate characters.",

In some cases, derived states of character are not known to occur in any potential outgroup taxon. Here, a priori decisions can be made without difficulty. In cases in which heterogeneity exists for character states both in the outgroup taxa and in the Signiphoridae, I took the approach of searching for the globally most parsimonious solution over both the ingroup and outgroup. If such a solution can be found, it will also be most parsimonious for the ingroup alone (Maddison et al., 1984; Farris, 1982) . However, use of outgroup rooting in PAUP allows for results in which ingroup and outgroup relationships are not maintained (i.e. PAUP allows solutions in which a specified ingroup is not monophyletic). This was not a problem with these data because the monophyly of Signiphoridae is well supported, as discussed below. In yet other cases, outgroup comparisons were not possible at all, as character states involved changes in structures found only in the Signiphoridae. That is, assumptions of homology cannot be made for such structures in the outgroup. In these cases, data were scored as missing in outgroup taxa, and the polarity of morphoclines within the Signiphoridae was established on the basis of parsimony. In the description of characters that follows, it may be assumed that (0) represents the assumed plesiomorphic condition (i.e. an a priori decision is straightforward) unless it is stated otherwise.

The function of these structures is unknown but they appear to be present in all chalcidoids. Khashef (1953) studied the structure of these processes in Lariophagus distinguendus Foerster (Pteromalidae). He found that the processes are chitinous and hollow and described a patch of glandular tissue situated in the mandibular lumen between the processes and the ventral inner surface of the mandible. A secretory function for these structures seems likely, but has not been demonstrated. For convenience, I use the term mandibular ducts for these structures.

The posterior margin of the vertex is narrowly rounded in Chartocerus species and acute in Signiphora.

In Clytina the head is subprognathous and elongated dorsoventrally, thus appearing subrectangular in dorsal aspect (Fig. 6 ). In forms with an orthognathous head the foramen is situated about one half of the distance from the vertex to the ventral margins of the genae and the proboscidial fossa occupies roughly the ventromedial third of the posterior surface of the head. In Clytina the foramen is displaced considerably towards the vertex. In addition, in forms with a subprognathous head the hypostornal bridge and anterior tentorial arms are much elongated. Head orientation was treated as a two-state character: orthognathous (0), prognathous (1). 5. Segmentation of male funicle. The antennae of Signiphoridae are composed of from four to seven segments: an elongate scape, which is rarely dilated ventrally, an elongate and subconical pedicel, a reduced funicle of from one to four short annelli or ring segments, and a more or less elongate, unsegmented club (Fig. 7) . Sexual dimorphism for the number of funicle segments occurs in some species; therefore, funicle segmentation for males and females was treated as two separate characters. The number of funicle segments in the antennae of male Signiphoridae varies from one to four. The number of male funicle segments was treated as an unordered meristic character, or as an ordered character using the following transformation series: 1( =)2(=)3(=)4. In coding antenna1 segmentation for outgroup species, homology of funicle segments between Signiphoridae and Aphelinidae could not be assumed. For example, Coccophagus spp. have a single annellus, a threesegmented funicle, and a three-segmented club. Azotinae have two annelli, a four-segmented funicle, and an unsegmented club. Both taxa have seven flagellomeres, suggesting that the distinction between annelli, funicle and club is artificial within Aphelinidae. Therefore, male and female funicle segmentation for outgroup taxa were scored as missing.",

In most signiphorids, the phallobase is more heavily sclerotized at its posterior end between the points of articulation of the digital sclerites. In many signiphorids this region bears a pair of more or less elongate denticles (md: Fig. lS) , the presence of which is apparently unique in the Chalcidoidea. These medial denticles are lacking in Thysanus (Fig. 17 ) and in some Signiphora species. In certain other Signiphora spp. they are large and falcate. The phallobase of genitalia bearing these medial denticles often displays a sclerotic medial ridge on the dorsal surface, visible in cleared slide-mounts as a longitudinal darkened streak terminating at the anterior margin of the phallobase. I have not observed these medial denticles in the outgroup taxa (or in other chalcidoids). These attributes were coded as an unordered multistate character or the following transformation series was assumed: medial denticles absent (0), present but not falcate (l), present, robust and falcate (2). 18. Denticles on digiti of male genitalia. The digiti of most signiphorid males bear a single denticle at the apex (ad: Fig. lS) , generally short and curved laterally but occasionally elongate. The digiti of male Thysanus bear a second subapical denticle on each digitus (sad: Fig. 17 ). This character was coded as follows: one apical denticle (0), one apical and one subapical denticle (1). 19. Microtrichiae on forewing. The fore-and hindwings of all Signiphoridae lack microtrichiae except for very few setae or bristles that occur in characteristic locations. The absence of vestiture of fully developed wings is unusual in the Chalcidoidea and is a synapomorphy for Signiphoridae as well as a convenient recognition characteristic. The presence or absence of microtrichiae was coded as a binary character: present (0), absent (1). 20. Discal seta on forewing. The forewings of many Signiphoridae bear a single, long, dorsal seta in the middle of the discal area posterior to the marginal vein (discal seta: Fig. 19 ). The point of insertion of this seta lies in or close to an oblique crease, generally found running in a posteromedial direction back across the wing from a point just posterior to the stigma1 vein. Presence or absence of a discal seta on the forewing was coded as a binary character: absent (0), present (1). 21. Setae on forewing submarginal vein. The submarginal vein of signiphorids bears one or two long setae on the dorsal surface. The num-ber of setae on the submarginal vein was treated as a meristic character. The Azotinae bear a single seta on the submarginal vein. Coccophagus species bear several to many. The homology of the setae in Coccophagus with those in Signiphoridae is questionable; therefore, this character was scored as missing for the outgroup taxon Coccophaginae. 22. Seta M6 on forewing marginal vein. The marginal vein of signiphorids bears a number of long, dorsal setae on its anterior (leading) and posterior (trailing) margins. The number of dorsal setae present varies somewhat but the location of particular setae, when present, does not vary (with few exceptions), so that it is possible to treat individual dorsal setae on the marginal vein as homologous. I have assigned a notation to the individual dorsal setae on the marginal vein. Fig. 19 shows a marginal vein in which six dorsal setae are present. Four setae are present on the anterior margin and are numbered M1 to M4. Seta MS lies on the posterior margin apical to M1 but proximal to M2. Seta M6 also lies on the posterior margin between the points of insertion of M2 and M3. Two rules allow this notation to be applied without ambiguity (with a few exceptions). Seta M1, if present, is always proximal to MS (always present), and seta M3 is always distal to M6. The presence of absence of particular setae is characteristic of particular genera or species. Chartocerus spp. (Fig. 20) have a characteristic venation in which seta M1 is present or absent, two anterior setae are proximal to M6 (M2 and M2B) and two anterior setae are distal to M6 (M3 and M4). Seta M6 is lacking in both Thysanus and Clytina, but is present on most other signiphorids. The presence or absence of setae M6 in Signiphoridae was coded as a simple binary character: absent (0), present (1). Species of Azotinae have a similar setation on the fore-wing ventation but it is difficult to determine homologies between setae. On Alberus clisiocampae (Ashmead) , four or five dorsal setae are present on the anterior edge of the marginal vein (corresponding to M1-M4, Fig. 19 & Yashnosh, 1966) . The venation of Coccophagus is quite setose and no homologies with Signiphoridae are apparent. This character was scored as a missing data point for Coccophaginae and as present for Azotinae. 23. Shape of hindwing. The hindwing of Signiphoridae varies considerably in width but generally (except in brachypterous species) it is subequal in length to the forewing. The shape of the hindwing ranges from broadly rounded (e.g. the dipterophaga species group of Signiphora) (Fig. 24) , to slightly rounded (e.g. Churtocerus) (Fig. 23) , to almost parallel-sided (actually slightly spatulate, e.g. the flavopalliutu species group of Signiphora) (Fig. 22) . The distinction between broadly rounded and slightly rounded hindwings is subjective, but the distinction between either and parallel-sided wings is less so. Therefore the shape of the hindwing was coded a a binary character: broadly or slightly rounded (0), parallel-sided (1). The hindwing is broadly or slightly rounded in the outgroup taxa.",

This attribute was coded as a binary character: discal seta absent (0), discal seta present (1). 25. Spines on middle femur. The middle femur of most signiphorids is robust and bears several rows of short, stout setae along the anterior margin (Fig. 11 ). Most signiphorids have from one to four long spines (i.e. longer than the width of the middle femur) in the posteroapical area of the femur and one or two short spines just apical to the long spine(s) (Fig. 11) . The number and relative length of these spines is useful in discriminating between species, but their position varies little throughout the family. The number of long spines in the posteroapical area was coded either as an unordered meristic character, or as the following transformation series: 0 (=)1( =)2( =)3 or 4. 26. Shape of middle femur.

In assembling sets of equally parsimonious solutions, PAUP treats all such totally bifurcating trees as distinct. In the discussions herein, reference is sometimes made to a number of equally parsimonious tree structures found by PAUP given a set of input parameters. Unless otherwise stated, the actual number of unique tree structures is less, perhaps far less, than the number presented.

The changes from spines absent to one spine, and from two spines to either three or four spines are not homoplastic, and were included in the largest clique of compatible characters. Thus, by recoding this character to the following sequence: O=spines absent, 1 =one or two spines, 2=three or four spines, the effects of homoplasy for the intermediate states could be eliminated. This was done for subsequent analyses. Strauch (1984) suggested another method to deal with homoplastic characters using compatibility methods. The largest clique of compatible characters is used to define the major lineages. Then, homoplastic characters within each major lineage are re-examined to see if any may be compatible in the context of a particular lineage (branch of a tree). This can be done by running a second compatibility analysis for taxa that constitute such a monophyletic subset of the original taxa. If a larger clique of characters result for the subset, the additional characters are added to the tree structure, subject to the constraint that any new characters must be consistent with the largest original clique of characters. Strauch's (1984) method was used following compatibility analysis for the lineage defined by a pectinate calcar (28) and propodeum with a medial sclerite bearing lamelliform process (9).",

The a priori ordering of multistate characters into morphoclines produced a dramatic decrease in the number of equally parsimonious solutions (Table 2) . Imposing an ordering on all five remaining multistate characters resulted in a single solution (Fig. 29) with a length of thirtyfivesteps and a CI of 0.829. Treatingcharacter 6, the number of segments in the female funicle, as unordered alone or in combination with any other character(s) produced a thirty-four step tree. The reason for this is simple: a state change for character 6 from 3 to 1 (in Kerrichiella) is Combinations of characters in cells are numbered as they are in the text. All trees in which character 6 was unordered, alone or in any combination, had a length of thirtyfour steps. All other trees had length of thirty-five steps. Note that in the case in which all characters were ordered, the forty-five different, bifurcating solutions were determined to be topologically identical (Fig. 29 ). In the other cases, the number of unique topologies was not determined, but is less than the number shown. parsimonious solution was found, with an overall CI of 0.897. One character (3) was homoplastic with the outgroup taxon AZOTINAE, while two characters (25 and 27) showed reversals. The structure of this cladogram did not differ substantially from Fig. 29 . However, with this drastically reduced character set, only seven terminal taxa with character states 63, 9*, 28' could be resolved, versus nine such taxa in Fig.  29 . In the discussions that follow, a superscripted notation is used to indicate character numbers followed by character states, e.g. 63 represents state 3 of character 6. As discussed above, Strauch's (1984) method was employed following compatibility analysis to determine if any homoplastic characters could be retrieved for the lineage defined by the presence of a lamelliform process on the median sclerite of the propodeum (g2) and a pectinate calcar (28l). A single largest clique of thirty-two additive-binary characters was found for this subset of taxa. The following additional characters were compatible within this lineage only: 1 (states 3(=)2 only), 2, 6 (3 annelli (=)4 annelli only), 21 and 23. As a result, more taxa within this lineage could be discriminated. Table 1 lists the relevant terminal taxa in Figs 29 and 30 and the OTUs which each terminal taxon represents. A cladogram showing the revised topology for this lineage is shown as Fig. 30. counted as one step if the character is unordered and as two steps if it is ordered. Treating characters 1, 6 or 25 as unordered, alone or in any combination, had no effect on the number of trees produced. If character 15, projections on the syntergum, was unordered, 105 trees resulted, and 315 trees resulted if character 5, segments in male funicle, was unordered. If both characters 5 and 15 were unordered together, 735 equally parsimonious solutions resulted. Again, the actual number of topologically different solutions is much less than 105,315 or 735 (due to multifurcations) but the actual number of distinct topologies was not determined. A strict consensus solution for the set of 735 trees resulting if all characters are unordered was examined. The primary effect of unordering characters is to lose some resolution of relationships between the taxa above the node defined by characters 9 and 28 in Fig. 29 . The structure of the remainder of the cladogram is not affected. For example, one of the effects of unordering character 15, the ventrolateral projections on the syntergum in males, is to allow an equally parsimonious solution in which this character changes from state (kl (no projections to small projections) in 'New Genus' taxa and from state ( k 2 (no projections to large projections) in S.maxima and Rozanoviella spp. If character 5, funicle segments in males, is treated as unordered, the sister group relationship between Kerrichiella and Signiphora n s p . 2 is lost in the consensus tree. That is, Kerrichiella arises from a pentafurcation at the base of this lineage.",

A narrow or acute occipital margin is a ground-plan state, with parallel evolution of a rounded occipital margin in Azotinae and the common ancestor to Thysanus and Clytina. Three annelli in male signiphorids and four annelli in females are ground-plan character states, followed by the addition of one annellus in male Thysanus and the loss of one annellus in female Signiphora. However, homoplasy is present here (a reversal to four annelli in females of the 'New Genus' group). Some readers may prefer a scheme in which the larger number of annelli is pleisiomorphic in both sexes. Although the consensus among chalcidoid workers is that eleven flagellar segments (with eight funicle segments including annelli) are plesiomorphic for Chalcidoidea, considerable reduction in antennal segmentation has taken place in Aphelinidae, in which from three to seven The effect of ordering character 5 is to tie Kerrichiella and Signiphora nsp. 2 together based only on the presence of two funicle segments in male antennae (Figs 29,30) . However, the number of male funicle segments is further reduced to one in Kerrichiella. The two taxa share only one 'synapomorphy' (reduced funicle segmentation) and they share no uniquely derived character state. Thus, there is no strong indication of relationship and this grouping appears to be an artefact of an a priori specification of a transformation series. Even worse, the derived character states are reductions, notoriously unreliable indicators of relationship (Hecht & Edwards, 1977) .

As discussed above (character 7), assuming a one to one homology between flagellomeres of Signiphoridae and Aphelinidae is questionable, therefore, the unsegmented club of Azotinae and Signiphoridae may not be a reliable indication of relationship. An epiproct occurs so sporadically in Chalcidoidea that the absence of a sclerotized epiproct must be presumed to be plesiomorphic. A parallel gain of an epiproct in female Azotinae and Signiphoridae is certainly possible, especially since the conformation of these terga is somewhat different in each group. However, a sister group relationship is still indicated by the presence of anterior apodemes on S3-S6 in both taxa. No such apodemes are found on any other chalcidoids, to my knowledge. No synapomorphies here unite Coccophaginae with Azotinae + Signiphoridae. The usefulness of Coccophaginae in these analyses has been to polarize character state changes below Azotinae in Fig. 29 .",

It is perhaps surprising that three of these characters were of so little use in inferring relationships within Signiphoridae. I have not observed medial denticles (character 17) on the male genitalia of other Chalcidoidea. Although these denticles occur only in some Signiphoridae (see Appendix A), these results suggest that the expression of this character is very unstable. Similarly, the discal setae on both the fore-and hindwings (characters 20 and 24) are unique features as setae in analogous locations are not found in other chalcidoids. Again, these results suggest that these setae have an unstable pattern of expression in Signiphoridae.",

The most parsimonious solution (Fig. 29 ) requires an epiproct in females and not in males as ground-plan character states for Signiphoridae. The epiproct in male signiphorids other than Chartocerus is acquired independently. This hypothesis is reasonable given that a separate, sclerotized and well-defined epiproct is not apparent in male Azotinae. However, recall that much of the syntergum on male Azotinae is very membranous and difficult to observe. If it is later shown that male Azotinae do, in fact, possess a sclerotized epiproct, the polarity of character 14 in Signiphoridae will reverse. In the context of the other data presented here, reversing the polarity of character 14 alone results in 315 thirty-six step trees (one step less parsimonious than Fig. 29 ). The consensus tree for these solutions lacks resolution of relationships above the basal node for Signiphoridae and the node in Fig. 29 defined by character states 92 and 28'. In these solutions, to the synapomorphies for Signiphoridae + Azotinae ( Fig. 29) is added 14l, epiproct present in males. Reversing polarity of character 14 allows for tree topologies in which possession of four annelli in males becomes a ground-plan state for Signiphoridae, and Thysanus spp. become the sister group of remaining Signiphoridae, which lose one annellus in males. Clytina spp. are sister group to Chartocerus+Signiphora. A margined occiput becomes a synapomorphy for Char-tocerus+Signiphora rather than a ground-plan state of Signiphoridae which is independently lost in Azotinae and Thysanus+Clytina.",

This lineage ( Fig. 30 : S.pulchra+ 'New Genus'+ S. maxima + Rozanoviella) can be characterized by a single reliable synapomorphy: the presence of either large or small ventrolateral projections on the syntergum of males (Figs 16, 18) . The relationship of S. hyalinipennis and a closely related new species (included with hyalinipennis, Figs 29,30) to this group are problematic. An emarginate S7 in males would suggest that both species should be placed in this group (Fig. 30) . However, this character is weakly expressed in these species and it is, in fact, polymorphic in both of them. In addition, the conformation of S8 in both species is like that of other Signiphora (cf. Fig. 15 ) and quite unlike the 'dumb-bell' shaped S8 characteristic of the dipterophaga group species (Figs 16, 18) . The projections on T8, the distinctive shape of S8, and the strongly emarginate S7 form a complex of modifications to the male genital opening which provide strong evidence for the monophyly of the dipterophaga group. Therefore, I include S.hyalinipennis (and the new species) in the bifasciata group. Two lineages may be present in the dipterophaga group. In the species included in Rozanoviella by previous authors and in S.maxima the ventrolateral projections on T8 in males are particularly well developed (Fig. 18) . Males of several of these species also have dilated middle femora (cf. (1) a robust, almost spherical habitus, (2) a reduced setation of the marginal vein in the forewing, (3) extremely short marginal fringe of the forewing (cf. Fig. 32 : Rozanov, 1965 ). One of these species displays a reduction in the funicle in both sexes. There can be little question that these species represent a monophyletic lineage. However, no characters were found that are informative as to the relationship of these species to other Signiphoridae. As noted above in the Discussion (second paragraph), Fig. 30 would suggest that Signiphora n.sp. 2 should be included in this group. However, this species shares no synapomorphies with the coleoptratus FIG. 30 . Solution obtained for Signiphora spp. using the single largest clique of thirty-two additive-binary characters that are compatible within this lineage only. Consistency index= 1.00. Autapomorphies are shown if they are discussed in the text. Species groups of Signiphora proposed here include the following terminal taxa,fZavopalliata group: flavopalliaiu, nsp. 6, and mexicana; bifmciata group: nsp. 2, bifmciaia, and hyalinipennis; coleoptratus group: 'Kerrichiellu'; dipterophaga group: pulchra, 'New Genus', maxima and 'Rozanoviella'. The number of species represented by each terminal taxon is indicated in parentheses and the OTUs which each terminal taxon represents are shown in Table 2. species and its placement in this lineage in Fig.  30 is an artefact of an a priori specification of a transformation series for character 5. Therefore, I place this species in the bifasciata group.",

Nikol'skaya (1950) brought Xana Kurdjumov into the Signiphoridae, treated Matritia as a junior synonym of Xana and described Signiphorina. Rozanov (1965) brought Chartocerus into the Signiphoridae for the first time. He delimited three subgenera: Chartocerus, Xana (treating Matritia as a junior synonym) and Signiphorina. Most authors have treated Xana and Matritia as synonyms. However, the priority of one name or the other is in doubt. The matter was discussed in detail elsewhere (Woolley, 1986) . Rozanov (1965) and others (e.g. Hayat, 1970 Hayat, , 1976 Hayat & Verma, 1980) used several characters to separate subgenera of Chartocerus. Most of these characters involve relative lengths and widths of the hindwing and antenna1 club, and length of the marginal cilia relative to the width of the fore-and hindwings. The attributes used to separate Xana (or Matritia) from Signiphorina do not present any character states that are readily ordered into transformation series, thus none were included in the analyses reported here. Study of Chartocerus species has not yet revealed any new characters that would justify retaining Xana (or Matritia) and Signiphorina as subgenera.",

A potential synapomorphy for this subgenus was described by Rozanov (1965) and discussed by Hayat & Verma (1980) . Chartocerus musciformis and C. walkeri have distal papilliform processes on the phallobase of the male genitalia (Fig. 15) , lateral to the digiti. The position of these structures corresponds with that of the parameres of other Chalcidoidea, although homology with parameres is questionable. In addition to paratypes of C. walkeri, I have seen two other male specimens with such genitalia. Both of these species are known only from the Oriental region.",

The two species included in the subgenus Chartocerus (Chartocerus) (Hayat & Verma, 1980) are known only from India and Sri Lanka, but otherwise the genus is cosmopolitan. Timberlake, 1924: 246. Diagnosis. Two synapomorphies characterize Thysanus: (1) male antenna with four annelli, (2) digitus of male genitalia with two denticles, one at the apex and one at the midpoint on the medial surface, In addition, Thysanus spp. (along with Clytina spp.) lack seta M6 from the forewing marginal vein, and have a rounded occipital margin. Thysanus species have tridentate mandibles (except for one new species, which has four teeth) and the mandibular ducts are expanded distally (an apparent parallelism with some Signiphora spp.). Rozanov (1965) and others (e.g. Quezada et al., 1973) noted an anterior projection of the phallobase of the male genitalia in Thysanus. Males of T.ater generally have such a projection but it is lacking from males of some other Thysanus spp., and present in certain other signiphorids (cf. Fig. 18 ). In most species of Thysanus, the midtibial spur is relatively short, on the order of half the length of the middle basitarsus, as opposed to other signiphorids in which the spur and basitarsus are subequal in length.",

As noted above, Thysanus rusti Timberlake (the OTU THYSRUST in this study) displays all of the synapomorphies of Thysanus spp. Rozanov (1965) and Gordh (1979) treated Neosigniphora as a junior synonym of Thysanus. However, De Santis (1968 and Hayat & Verma (1980) treated Neosigniphora as a valid genus, based on the supposedly acute occipital margin in T.rusti. The occipital margin of other Thysanus (and Clytina spp.) is rounded. The type specimens of T.rusti are in balsam and in poor condition. The shape of the occipital margin cannot be discerned. I have examined the few other available specimens of T.rusti, all of which are slide-mounted, and in these the occipital margin appears to be rounded. One would prefer to examine live material or well-preserved dry material to observe this character. However, even if the occipital margin of T.rusti is acute, as De Santis (1968) suggests, this would constitute an autapomorphy for this species only, and would not justify retaining Neosigniphoru as a valid genus.",

Signiphora borinquensis and S. merceti display an unusual mode of development (Quezada et al., 1973; Agekyan, 1968 ). Eggs of these species are deposited internally in female scales, the first and second instars feed as internal parasites. The larvae then emerge through the host integument and complete development as external parasites. Signiphora flavella is known to be a primary parasite (DeBach et al., 1958) and it apparently is an ectoparasite (Matta V., 1979, cited as S.aspidioti). Notes and records for S.perpauca that I have examined indicate that this species is a primary external parasite of Diaspididae. Signiphora coquilletti, aleyrodis and townsendi are known to be obligate hyperparasites of Aphelinidae and Platygasteridae in Aleyrodidae (e.g. Woolley & Vet, 1981) . Signiphora flavopalliata occidentalis is known to be an obligate hyperparasite of Diaspididae (DeBach, 1953) . Signiphora fax is apparently also a hyperparasite of Diaspididae. The other species listed have been reared from Diaspididae or Aleyrodidae, but no further information is available.",
