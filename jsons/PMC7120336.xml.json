            "text": "The current lymphoma classification system is based on both morphologic and biologic characteristics of lymphomas. The Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL) system was developed in 1994 to incorporate morphology, clinical features, immunophenotype and cytogenetics [22]. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification subsequently updated the REAL system with minor modifications [23]. This integrated system \u2013 WHO/REAL classification \u2013 is currently in clinical use for both HD and NHL [24]. Despite the complexity and diversity of this integrated system, lymphomas are traditionally subdivided into two broad categories: Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL). Also for practical purposes NHL can be classified into indolent (low-grade) and aggressive lymphomas. NHL accounts for more than 85% of the lymphomas. Aggressive lymphomas constitute approximately 60% of NHL series, while indolent lymphomas account for approximately 40% of new diagnoses. The vast majority of NHL (\u223c90%) are of B-cell origin. Early stage lymphoma is curable in greater than 75% of patients; however, advanced stage disease is curable in only 50% of patients [25].",

Although staging is clinically important, studies of immunophenotype and molecular genetics are essential to refine diagnosis and management, particularly in NHL. Until recently, extended field RT has been considered the standard treatment for early stage HD. There is, however, an increasing trend to employ chemotherapy and most groups adopted a strategy using short duration chemotherapy combined with involved field RT (restricted to involved lymph nodes) in this group of patients [30]. Advanced stage (stages III\u2013IV) disease is invariably treated with multiple chemotherapy protocols. Thus, staging still holds its critical position in the management of lymphoma even with the latest changes in therapeutic approach. In patients with HD or aggressive NHL (mostly DLCL), the therapy objective is the complete eradication of disease while minimizing adverse short- or long-term complications of therapy, particularly related to the RT. Unnecessary use of RT could result in excess toxicity such as secondary malignancies and cardiac disease, while appropriate use can potentially decrease risk of disease recurrence and allow for shorter courses of chemotherapy cycles attendant reduction of chemotherapy toxicity [31]. Hence, segregating patients who could achieve cure without the need of RT is an important management strategy involving imaging.",

FDG PET findings can be an independent predictor of tumor response or complementary to the established prognostic factors; international prognostic index in NHL and international prognostic score in HD, and potentially contribute to, or single-handedly, direct a change in management. For this concept to be of practical value, however, alternative treatment options should be available and also establishment of prognosis as favorable or poor must be followed up with a treatment change that is necessary and sufficiently effective to improve outcomes.",

Patients usually present with advanced stage disease (Ann Arbor stages II and IV) with generalized lymphadenopathy and extranodal involvement (90%) (BM, liver spleen GIT) similar to other indolent lymphomas. The prognosis is invariably poor, however, due to aggressive and progressive clinical course with no curative conventional therapy generally available. Imaging for staging purposes does not have major influence on management due to disseminated nature of disease; however, evaluation of therapy response is important for potential therapeutic alterations. PET-CT may have a niche in the posttherapy period for evaluating residual masses and therapy response. Nonetheless, in the absence of effective alternative therapy options, the role for imaging in the management of mantle cell lymphoma is relatively limited.",

The treatment in indolent lymphomas is defined by clinical symptoms rather than disease extent; therefore, determination of extent of disease or therapy response may not lead to improved outcomes. With current therapeutic strategies, identification of additional disease sites using PET-CT in the staging of indolent NHL is not an important determinant of management, as 80\u201390% of patients initially present with advanced-stage disease with generalized nodal and extranodal disease (mainly BM) involvement. New approaches combining classical dose-intense chemotherapy with \u201ctumor-specific\u201d antibody targeting may lead to a survival benefit [32], potentially increasing the role of imaging in the management of low-grade NHL. Nonetheless, imaging currently has a limited role in the management of indolent lymphoma owing to specific features of the disease. A characteristic of indolent lymphomas is the phenomenon of spontaneous regression. Such spontaneous regression is usually partial and short-lived, and imaging findings can help determine the disease status which may prompt therapy during the active course of disease. Other characteristics of indolent lymphomas include synchronous discordant lymphomas (20\u201330% of newly diagnosed patients) and transformation to an aggressive subtype (30\u201350%) during the first 10 years following diagnosis [33]. In these situations, PET-CT has a definite role to determine the sites of discordant lymphomas as well as transformation for biopsy guidance and subsequent effective management.",

Most mediastinal lymph nodes can be detected without intravenous contrast, but are more reliably measured on contrast enhanced scans. Inclusion of the neck in the CT or MRI evaluation yields a more accurate staging as lymphoma, particularly with HD, which accounts for 10% of the head and neck tumors. When lymphoma involves cervical lymph nodes they can be either enlarged or numerous. In general cervical, axillary, and mediastinal lymph nodes are considered abnormal when their short axis diameter exceeds 10 mm. This size criterion of 6 mm has been advocated for prevascular, internal mammary, posterior mediastinal, and anterior diaphragmatic lymph nodes [37].",

Mediastinal HD is characterized by the presence of a discrete anterior superior mediastinal mass with surface lobulation due to involvement and coalescence of multiple lymph nodes (Fig. 22.2), while characteristic features of mediastinal aggressive NHL, mainly diffuse large cell type, included regular contour and absence of associated cervical and abdominal lymphadenopathy [38]. In general, extranodal involvement of the lung parenchyma, pleura, and pericardium is more common with NHL than with HD because of the frequent vascular invasion and hematogenous spread associated with the former [39]. Although CT and MRI are equally sensitive in the evaluation of mediastinal involvement, CT is usually preferred for its availability and relatively lower cost. MRI is spared for patients with iodine allergies and poor renal function. CT plays a significant role for recognizing bulky mediastinal HD as these patients have worse prognosis due to higher risk of disease recurrence compared to those with nonbulky disease. Bulky disease is defined as a mediastinal mass exceeding one third of the chest diameter or greater than 10 cm in diameter.\n",

Overall, FDG PET is more sensitive and specific than CT in identifying lymphoma involved lymph nodes, except in the case of indolent lymphomas, which demonstrate low level or absent FDG tracer uptake [9, 48\u201352]. In general, FDG PET has been superior to CT alone in the detection of nodal disease except in the abdomen and pelvis, in which the two methods have produced equivalent results. However, combined PET-CT systems can improve the sensitivity and specificity of the FDG PET image further, particularly in the neck, abdomen and pelvis. In a small study of 19 patients with nodal disease (either HD or aggressive NHL) evaluated by both PET-CT and separately acquired contrast enhanced CT studies [53], PET-CT demonstrated additional lesions in four patients which were not detected on contrast-enhanced CT, while contrast-enhanced CT did not depict any nodal involvement that was undetectable on PET-CT [53]. As noted, however, when the lymphoma subtype is one with characteristically low or absent FDG tracer uptake, such as MALT, CLL/SLL, peripheral T cell, and low-grade follicular lymphoma, the CT findings based on lymph node size will be the chief criterion for nodal involvement.",

It is becoming now feasible to routinely assess the entire marrow using MRI; however, in the follow-up period, persistent posttherapy MRI abnormalities may give rise to false positive results [59]. Cortical bone involvement can be primary or secondary, the former is usually of NHL type. Primary bone lymphoma has a tendency to involve the metaphyseal regions of the appendicular skeleton while secondary bone lymphoma usually involves the spine.

Distinguishing infectious etiology such as toxoplasmosis can be a challenge for morphologic imaging studies, including CT and MRI, particularly in patients with AIDS. Due to the low sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction test for toxoplasmosis and Epstein-Barr virus titers for lymphoma, patients with AIDS and CNS lesions are empirically treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for 2\u20134 weeks. Essentially, a lesion with an FDG uptake higher than the adjacent gray matter indicates a malignant process which should be biopsied for confirmation rather than empirically treated as infectious. T1-201 is also known as a valuable imaging tool in the differentiation of CNS lymphoma from infectious causes, especially toxoplasmosis [69]. There are no systematic prospective data comparing T1-201 findings with those of FDG PET in the evaluation of CNS lymphoma, however, in few anecdotal cases we have observed that the sensitivity of FDG PET appears to be better than T1-201 imaging in the detection of CNS lymphoma. Difficulty arises, however, when CNS lymphoma undergoes necrosis or is below the resolution limits of PET systems (<8 mm).",

The incidence of BM involvement at diagnosis varies according to the type of lymphoma. In general, the incidence is very low in patients with HD (as low as 1\u20132%), while it is commonly observed in low-grade lymphoma (mainly follicular cell subtype) (60\u201370%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma (90\u2013100%). In aggressive NHL (mainly diffuse large cell lymphoma), BM infiltration is seen in 25\u201340% of patients [70]. BM biopsy is the mainstay of BM evaluation despite its association with a high rate of false-negative findings due to sampling errors. MRI is especially useful in detecting BM involvement; however, its sensitivity is much higher than its specificity and thus benign entities such as hemangiomas and inflammatory processes can easily mimic lymphoma. Overall, focal FDG uptake suggests pathological BM activity, a pattern more commonly seen in HD patients (Fig. 22.11). In aggressive NHL, the degree of BM involvement may range from a few cells to complete marrow replacement. In cases with the latter condition, FDG uptake is usually diffuse and somewhat heterogeneous. Diffusely increased FDG uptake is also observed in patients with BM hyperplasia, particularly following administration of colony stimulating factors (e.g., G-CSF) (Fig. 22.12) [71, 72].\n\n\n",

Certain hemopoietic stimulants used in chemotherapy regimens, however, can cause diffuse splenic FDG uptake as well as diffuse bone marrow FDG activity. With the advent of combined PET-CT imaging, accuracy in the detection of extranodal lymphoma is advanced by the complementary strengths of the two modalities. In a small series involving 19 patients comparing PET-CT with non\u2013contrast-enhanced CT to conventional fully optimized contrast-enhanced CT alone, the PET-CT detected extranodal disease (bone and splenic involvements) in three patients while separately acquired contrast-enhanced CT was false-negative at these sites.

Differences in slice thickness and inconsistencies in the use of intravenous contrast may render the comparisons difficult. Following therapy, the mass attenuation values of the lymph nodes decreases with or without overall reduction in lymph node size in responding patients; however, there is no established standard for an accurate categorization of responders and nonresponders based on CT criteria. Achieving a complete response, which is defined as complete disappearance of the tumor mass, is the goal of cytotoxic therapy. However, failure to completely eradicate tumor mass with chemotherapy does not always correlate with persistent tumor cells or unfavorable prognosis [89]. This dilemma on anatomic imaging has been recognized in the response criteria for both HD and NHL [90, 91]. Both systems designate residual masses of unclear etiology as CRu, or unconfirmed/uncertain complete responses due to inherent uncertainty associated with posttherapy residual CT masses. Naturally, further and aggressive treatment in patients with benign posttherapy masses only increases morbidity and risk of second malignancies [31]. The patients with HD are at a higher risk of developing solid tumors years after therapy as a long-term side effect of combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. New masses discovered more than 10 years after therapy in the lung, thyroid, breast, and stomach should be considered as de novo primary tumors and must be verified by biopsy [92].",

The outcomes after HDT/SCT, however, can be significantly different between chemosensitive and chemoresistant patients. Hence differentiation of these two patient populations is important for the identification of the optimal group that would benefit from HDT/SCT. Patients with less than 25% decrease in SUV measured FDG tracer uptake in the lymphoma after HDT had a progressive disease course while among those with more than 25% decrease in SUVs, 86% remained in complete remission [108]. Similarly, another study found none of the patients with complete resolution of FDG tracer uptake in response to the initial course of therapy before HDT/SCT relapsed subsequently [109], while seven or eight patients with a moderate or high FDG tracer uptake before HDT/SCT relapsed [109].",

In a clinical study, 7 days after initiation of chemotherapy, tumor glucose metabolism as measured by FDG tracer uptake decreased by at least 74% in responding patients [113]. All lesions displayed a further decrease of FDG tracer uptake resulting in a total decrease of 83\u201396% from baseline to day 42 after initiation of therapy. There was no indication initial enhancement of FDG uptake as suggested by data from cell culture and animal studies. Further, the FDG tracer uptake values at day 42 were lower in patients with long-term remission compared to patients with early relapse [113]. Similarly, persistent FDG tracer uptake in the lymphoma after two to four cycles of chemotherapy was reported to predict poor progression-free survival in patients with aggressive NHL and HD [105, 106]. Persistent FDG uptake after a few cycles of chemotherapy was associated with relapse rates ranging from 70% to 100% while the relapse rate in patients with complete disappearance of FDG tracer uptake during therapy was as low as 8%. In one study, at midtreatment, none of the patients with persistent abnormal FDG tracer uptake achieved a durable complete remission, while 84% of patients with negative FDG PET results remained in complete remission after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years [106]. In this study, multivariate analysis revealed that FDG PET at midtreatment was a stronger prognostic factor for progression free survival compared with IPI criteria.",

It has been demonstrated that FDG PET after one cycle of chemotherapy was predictive of long-term outcome in aggressive NHL and HD [104, 114]. In one series by Kostakoglu et al., patients with persistent FDG uptake after one cycle of chemotherapy had a shorter progression free survival (median, 5 months) than those with negative FDG PET results (progression-free survival medians not reached) after a follow-up of 36 months [104]. The positive and negative predictive values for FDG PET after one cycle chemotherapy were 90% and 85%, respectively. However, these results were obtained on a dual-head camera system which lacks sensitivity and therefore may give rise false-negative results. Recently, in a study by the same investigators, using a dedicated full ring PET system, all patients (17 patients) with no appreciable FDG uptake after one cycle of chemotherapy remained in complete remission after a follow-up of 12 months, whereas 90% of patients with a positive FDG PET result had a relapse or persistent disease requiring further therapy, including bone marrow transplantation. These are promising results; nonetheless, these data should be interpreted with caution until larger, multi-institutional studies with a longer follow-up period are executed. Additionally, comparison of the predictive value of early FDG PET scanning to more conventional prognostic measures (such as the International Prognostic Index in aggressive lymphoma) as not yet been performed with sufficient patients to establish whether FDG PET derived early response criteria provides superior or complementary prognostic information.",

            "text": "Benign lymphoproliferative disorders represent a spectrum of lymphoid abnormalities characterized by lymphocyte proliferation. LPD can be divided into two broad categories; benign and posttransplantation. The benign LPD most frequently manifest in the thorax, where the site can be the lymph nodes or in the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue of the lung [116]. Entities such as plasma cell granuloma, pseudolymphoma, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis involve the pulmonary parenchyma as a primary site of intrathoracic disease, while Castleman\u2019s disease, infectious mononucleosis and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy involve intrathoracic lymph nodes. It is important to differentiate the \u201cbenign\u201d forms of LPD from the more common, aggressive lymphomas. Overall, intrathoracic disease confined to one compartment, either lymph nodes or lung parenchyma, implies a more benign etiology whereas multiple sites of disease, a malignant neoplasm. There is considerable overlap between benign LPD and NHL, especially in the immunocompromised patients. One might assume that the FDG uptake would be lower in this benign form of LPD than that seen in aggressive NHL and HD. Only anecdotal case reports are available regarding the FDG uptake patterns in Castleman\u2019s disease in the literature [117, 118]. FDG accumulation in one of these case reports was modest (SUV: 6.2) in a hilar location and low in the other (SUV: 1.7\u20133.2) in a pelvic location. It is expected that in the indolent forms of NHL, the differentiation between benign LPD and lymphoma may not be possible. In the absence of a systematic study assessing FDG accumulation patterns, it is only speculative to discuss this topic; however, one must bear in mind that this category of diseases should be considered as a potential false-positive group among other granulomatous processes, especially in the posttherapy setting [119].",

It has been proposed that this finding is due to an immunologic rebound phenomenon characterized by lymph follicles with large nuclear centers and infiltration of plasma cells following thymic aplasia secondary to steroid-induced apoptosis and inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. Rebound thymic hyperplasia is associated with increased FDG tracer uptake and increased thymus volume. In children with a malignancy roughly 75% will have increased thymus FDG tracer uptake both prior to and following chemotherapy, although with a significant increase after therapy, while in young adults only about 5% will manifest increased thymic FDG uptake after chemotherapy [122, 123].",

Lymphoma patients after therapy, in particular after bone marrow transplantation, can develop cellular immunodeficiency until the transplanted marrow engrafts and creates new white blood cells. These patients are extremely susceptible to infections. Pulmonary infections are the most frequent complications in BMT recipients [124]. Idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis/ARDS, pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus, aspergillus, and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of infections [125]. Additionally, acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) often occurs during the first 3 months following an allogeneic BMT. To minimize the risk of graft rejection and GVHD, allogeneic BMT patients are given immunosuppressants to prevent GVHD before and after transplant. Use of these drugs, however, increases the risk of infection. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting PET-CT images in immunocompromised patients as infectious/inflammatory lesions and granulomas can be falsely interpreted as persistent or recurrent tumor.",
