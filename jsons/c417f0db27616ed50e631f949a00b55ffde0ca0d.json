A pre-post controlled study lasting for 18 months was undertaken in a 40-bed general intensive care unit (GICU). This included a 6-month baseline period (baseline group) and a 6-month intervention period (intervention group). The mobile terminal application program was applied to monitor the cuff pressure of endotracheal intubation as an intervention measure during the intervention period. ETT pressure was the main outcome measure, while gender, age, causes for ICU admission, sedation score, duration of prior intubation, size of ETT, and number of VAP patients were secondary outcomes. ETT cuff pressure was monitored 742 times in both the baseline group and the intervention group. A total of 56.9% of the cuff pressure measurements in the baseline group were within the recommended range, while 78.4% of measurements in the intervention group were within the recommended range, reflecting a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The application of the mobile terminal application program used for ETT cuff pressure measurement could improve the percentage of ETT cuff pressure measurements falling within the recommended range.",

Low pressures could increase the risk of leakage and pulmonary aspiration. Rello [4] showed that cuff pressure below 20 cm H 2 O was an independent risk factor for VAP (RR = 4.23). Currently, the incidence of VAP in patients with mechanical ventilation is as high as 6-52% [5] [6] [7] , which lead to the following serious consequences: VAP was associated with a 6.4-day extension of the duration of prior intubation [8] , a 12.5-day extension of ICU stay [8] , an average increase of $40,000 in hospital costs [5] , and a 13% increase in attributable mortality [9] .",

Nseir et al. measured cuff pressure every 8 h and found that cuff pressure was maintained within the recommended range in only 18% of patients [13] . Only a few large general hospitals in China have established a department of respiratory therapy [14] , and the ETT cuff pressure is managed by the nurse. Xiang et al. found that only 34.8% of nurses in a class III grade I hospital in Beijing used a manometer to assess cuff pressure scientifically [15] . Fu et al. measured cuff pressure 812 times in 53 patients and found that 46.3% of pressure was not within the normal range [16] . Therefore, it is necessary to improve the normative measurement of the ETT cuff pressure. We studied the application of a mobile terminal application program in the execution of ETT cuff pressure measurement, which could ensure that only the manometer is allowed to assess cuff pressure, with the pressure measured at least three times a day, and provide convenient feedback to improve the execution of the normative measurement of the ETT cuff pressure.",

In addition to the lack of training in cuff pressure measurement, these issues may be related to the following conditions. First, nurses may not use a manometer: The ratio of nurses to the number of beds as low as 1.91, which increases the nursing workload in the GICU of class III grade I hospitals in East China [25] , and thus, nurses would use the pilot balloon palpation method to assess pressure because it saves more time. However, the pilot balloon palpation method is less reliable in assessing pressure [10, 26] .
