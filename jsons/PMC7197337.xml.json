Shortly after, we limited our ambulatory visits to what we termed our \u201ccritical access\u201d plan. This adjustment included seeing only postoperative patients and urgent issues in patients where a telemedicine visit was not appropriate. With these reductions in clinic volumes, we had a notable limitation in the clinical hours our staff could obtain. We granted our hourly employees a bank of 80 hours of emergency PTO with the hope of stretching this PTO along with their personal accrued time to approximately 4 weeks before they were either furloughed or completely off without pay. We did allow them to take time off without pay during this period and some with severely limited hours sought unemployment benefits. We also instituted for our salaried employees a reduction of their pay for April and May. For our salaried employees and executives who participate in our management incentive pool historically, they had more notable salary reductions for that period of time.",

We are planning to consider placing all shareholder compensation in our main compensation plan (90% of the practice) in some sort of parity, and we will look to segment the financial losses and expenses of the second quarter and use our financing opportunities, which will be discussed later in this study.

Similar to the other groups previously mentioned, we have approximately 450 to 475 employees and support staff, a number of independent physical therapy centers, ASCs, DME outlets, MRIs, CTs, and radiology suites representing ancillary verticals. The compensation formula is complex, but it is tier based, sensitive to individual workloads, has a socialistic component of shared revenue, and rewards leadership, research, and service. At its fundamental core, the compensation formula encourages accountability and responsibility by assigning direct costs to physician partners and proportionately shared indirect costs (marginal and fixed). For employed physicians, the basic tenants are profit/loss compensation with a contribution to reduce indirect overhead prorated to their economic metrics.",

By March 19, 2020, we went from three to more than 100 providers trained on telehealth including our physical and occupational therapists.

We plan to bring employees back on line to meet the increasing demand and maximize our ability to use newly legislated small business benefits. Notably, although we are optimistic about the government relief from the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payment Program and the Small Business Administration (SBA) 7A loan, we have adopted a strategy that remains agnostic to those payments.

In addition, preserving the integrity of our banking relationships was a priority because they will be providing our credit line increases and hopefully, be administering our SBA loan and working with the practice to provide a smooth transition with ongoing debt management. We think that despite our hopes of resuming elective procedures at some point in the late summer or early fall of 2020, prospective patient demands will be substantially reduced, given unemployment, absence of healthcare benefits, a desire to work rather than convalesce, and generally, fewer injuries related to reduced activities.

Unfortunately, the Rothman Orthopaedics has over 1,500 employees and OrthoCarolina has close to 1,800 employees and does not qualify for the SBA benefits under the CARES Act. However, we encourage groups over 500 to work with outside legal counsel to appeal the current requirements and ask that the employee number requirement be raised because of the pandemic, hopefully allowing larger groups to qualify for these benefits.

Although previous studies have shown telemedicine to be safe with favorable patient perception, barriers for telehealth have impeded its adoption and utilization. The roadblocks to acceptance include using an operating system that complies with the HIPAA guidelines while at the same time being user friendly for a broad array of patients and providers.3\u20135 For instance, platforms such as FaceTime or Zoom are efficient for both providers and patients in that they require no downloads or logins, but these technologies require sharing of cell phone numbers and the use of unsecured communications. It should be noted that the HIPAA enforcement relating to telemedicine has been lessened during this national emergency and does permit outlets such as the aforementioned.6 Other options for using secure third-party platforms remain feasible for the future but still remain cumbersome for both patients and providers because most require additional software downloads on a phone or computer and the creation of an account. Furthermore, the physical assessment of a patient typically required for a complete evaluation remains an inherent obstacle (Figure 3). Regarding the current reimbursement, most payers have approved telemedicine services through June 1, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic along with the recognition of the standard evaluation and management codes for office visits.6 These visits are considered the same as in-person visits and will be reimbursed at the same rate as regular in-person visits. In addition, it should be noted that although the current waiver requires an established provider-patient relationship, the Health and Human Services will not conduct audits to ensure that such a previous relationship existed for claims submitted during this public health emergency.6",

From our experience, we have noticed that although new patient telehealth visits are seemingly more cumbersome and likely longer, postoperative and follow-up visits are more efficient than direct in-person visits. The telehealth visit might present an avenue for patients burdened by long travel distances to \u201csee\u201d their initial provider or who may wish to interview a surgeon before making surgical decisions. The risk to providers with medical comorbidities (ie, diabetes, smoking, heart disease, and older age) of contracting COVID-19 is another critical concern that can be partially alleviated with telemedicine. Researchers are in the process of validating methods to perform an orthopaedic physical examination, which will further improve the value of this telemedicine technology. The use of this technology will allow groups to protect their most valuable asset, the providers, while at the same time administering care for patients and developing the practice.",

To put staff reductions into perspective, at the beginning of March 2020, the the Rothman Institute had approximately 1,500 employees comprising approximately 1,400 FTE employees. After the adjustments described in phase 1, the practice now operates at approximately 700 FTE employees. In the first phase, this was accomplished without having to dismiss staff members. Although seeming altruistic, the additional goal of retaining the staff is the knowledge that the virus burden will lessen to levels that allow providers to be productive again. Having a foundation and staff in place will be essential to a healthcare practice's plan for recovery. In addition, the groups must be thoughtful regarding the office locations that are temporarily closed, being careful to not lose market share to competing practices during this period. Finally, we see a need to continue to use the Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASC) for three purposes\u2014patient care, continued staff employment, and revenue generation. Some leaders in medicine have proposed specific subspecialty guidelines,7\u20139 and the ASC allow orthopaedic practices at this time to continue to provide care for urgent and semiemergent pathologies that can be managed at stand-alone facilities (ie, locked bucket-handle meniscus, distal biceps injuries, and intra-articular displaced distal radius fractures). The ASC utilization should also be based on the regional COVID-19 burden and local resource allocation demands. As Pennsylvania may be one of the first states to peek, plateau, and subside with the COVID-19 surge, this puts the regional policies and group practices in position to model a restart plan.",

There may also be benefit from identifying those with immunity who can provide and receive care without the fear of illness. In addition, it is incumbent on medical practices to provide PPE for their staff members when evaluating patients in the clinical setting. There is a natural desire for a provider to be focused on the patient who has seemingly urgent needs as opposed to theoretical patients at other institutions.
