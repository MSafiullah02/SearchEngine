            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Although much about SARS remains poorly understood, it is clear that this disease has major implications, both for public health and the global economy. SARS emerged amongst the Chinese population in mid November 2002, but did not leave Guangdong Province until mid February 2003, when an infected individual brought the virus to a hotel in Hong Kong. From there, hotel guests rapidly disseminated the disease to distant places, such as Singapore, Vietnam and Canada. On August 7, 2003, 8422 cases were confirmed worldwide with overall case fatalities estimated at 14\u201315%; in persons over 50, the fatality exceeded 50%. SARS dramatically demonstrates the global havoc wreaked by a newly emerging infectious disease.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization coordinated an international investigation through its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/) and worked closely with health authorities in the affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support. Interestingly, the SARS outbreak came at a critical point when the scientific community was actively launching structural genomics projects (Lesley et al., 2002). The large size of the SARS-CoV RNA genome (\u223c30 kb) justified a structural genomic approach in itself. A number of research groups around the world responded immediately to the challenge of SARS being the first pandemic of the new millennium. Four months after the outbreak, the virus was identified as a new class of coronavirus (Peiris et al., 2003), 2 weeks later the genome sequencing was completed (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Zeng et al., 2003). The first structural model of a SARS-CoV protein was reported within another month (Anand et al., 2003) and the initial description of the proteome was reported a few months later (Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Since then, a number of groups around the world have worked towards the complete structural description of the proteome and all related functions (Almeida et al., 2007, Campanacci et al., 2003, Imbert et al., 2006, Joseph et al., 2006, Joseph et al., 2007, Li et al., 2005, Meier et al., 2006, Nelson et al., 2005, Peti et al., 2005, Ratia et al., 2006, Ricagno et al., 2006, Saikatendu et al., 2005, Saikatendu et al., 2007, Serrano et al., 2006, Sutton et al., 2004, Su et al., 2006, Zhai et al., 2005). While a number of important contributions were made by individual groups, a very systematic approach was taken by the European, US and Asian structural proteomics teams.

SPINE was one of the earliest funded integrated research projects (October 2003\u20132006) bringing together top European structural biology institutions in an unprecedented collaborative effort to develop new methods and technologies for high-throughput structural biology. SPINE was funded within Framework V of the European Commission and coordinated by Professor Dave Stuart of the Division of Structural Biology, University of Oxford. The project ran for 3 years from October 1, 2003 and involved more than 20 partners in 11 European countries working together to build a standard pipeline for identifying protein structures important for new drug discovery. VIZIER was funded though Framework VI of the European Commission and focuses on viral enzymes involved in replication. In addition, the European Commission supported SARS-CoV research through several Specific Targeted Research Projects. Two of these also made important contributions to SARS-CoV structural genomics: SEPSDA (http://www.sepsda.biochem.uni-luebeck.de), which was coordinated by Professor Rolf Hilgenfeld at the University of L\u00fcbeck, and SARS-DTV (http://www.sars-dtv.nl), coordinated by Professor Willy Spaan and Eric Snijder at Leiden University MedicalCenter.

            "text": "The last decade has seen a rapid development of miniaturized, automated and integrated methods and instrumentation development for structural biology (Lesley et al., 2002). While initially only applied to simple prokaryotic organisms (Lesley et al., 2002), it is now clear that these approaches are critical to the rapid understanding of complete viral organisms at the structural and functional level in support of developing means of therapeutic intervention. Clearly, these methods are being pushed to their limits and continued development is required that will ultimately enable individual laboratories and large international teams to tackle viral proteomes of both, emerging and re-emerging diseases. Many of the participating research groups are constantly developing, improving and sharing new technologies (Brooun et al., 2007, Stuart et al., 2006) to more reliably and faster clone, express, purify, crystallize, and functionally characterize viral proteins. A significant advancement of what was accomplished over the past 2 years through the biology-guided approach, which demonstrated that many of these methods and instrumentation had reached a level of maturity so that they could be applied rapidly to new problems. Intellectual drivers for these experiments have, in many cases, been the virologists. This development will likely prevail over the coming decade as more and more of the traditionally specialized resource intensive experiments such as mammalian or baculoviral expression systems, automated high-throughput crystallization and the use of international and local synchrotron sources have been streamlined and implemented for widespread laboratory use. Examples like miniaturized and automated crystallization and imaging systems as well as next generation crystallization geometries have demonstrated how new technologies can accelerate discovery on challenging targets. The next wave of these technology developments is now being driven by new roadblocks in the quest for high content structural biology on challenging targets such as viral proteins and their host partners.",

            "text": "Pathogenic viruses do not know any frontiers. Perhaps the greatest boost to viral structural genomics was the availability of the SARS-CoV sequence on the internet, as well as the openness of the small but dynamic coronavirus research world. Strains, sequences, clones, databases and all sorts of viral resources should become more easily available to appropriate labs, and large-scale efforts such as those ongoing in VIZIER and FSPS should be coordinated and bridged to other groups worldwide. (Investigators interested in joining this collaborative network are invited to contact the authors.) Structural proteomics has the great advantage of delivering atomic coordinates that can be quickly disseminated and not only used to considerably speed-up crystallographic problems but also promote cooperation. Given the importance of these pathogens and the possible worldwide impact of an outbreak, it is critical that the scientific community takes responsibility for addressing the needs for identifying and validating targets of therapeutic intervention. In this respect, the short response time of such big consortia has been truly remarkable in providing, for example, key structural data on SARS-CoV enzymes a prerequisite for expediting state-of-the-art drug design. This has been clearly demonstrated by the complementary work of the Canard, Rao and Kuhn labs on nsp15, a critical coronavirus endoribonuclease (Joseph et al., 2006, Ricagno et al., 2006, Xu et al., 2006).",
