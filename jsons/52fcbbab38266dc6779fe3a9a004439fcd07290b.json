In general, it is a disease of older adults; however, MM may effect younger patients as well: 15% are <50 years, 3% are <40 years, and 0.2% are <30 years in age [74] . It accounts for about 10% of hematological malignancies in the United States, with an estimated 30,770 new cases in 2018. Patients often present with osteolytic bone lesions, fractures, bone pain, progressive anemia, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, recurrent infections, and/or bleeding. If not treated appropriately and urgently, any of these may lead to death. The introduction of novel agents to the traditional arsenal of drugs comprising of steroids, chemotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation has shifted the treatment platform from one which often required repeated acute interventions to that of a more chronic manageable disease. As the acute complications can be potentially fatal, early recognition and intensive care management is the key to successful outcomes. These patients who present with complications are often excluded from MM trials, and their prognosis in the modern era is uncertain.",

Continued risk factors for death in this group of patients are organ failure, poor chronic health status, and delayed intensive care management [98] . Despite having increased life expectancy now, the majority of MM patients ultimately develop resistant subclones, leading to disease progression and disease-related complications. With increasing complexity of MM treatments, patients are at risk for more challenging drug toxicities. Recognizing and managing the potential side effects of present-day novel regimens is therefore a cornerstone in MM care. In this chapter, we will provide a systematic review of the key critical clinical events which cause medical emergencies in MM. This crucial, fundamental knowledge for all clinicians who routinely care for MM including intensivists will allow for optimal treatment outcomes and survival in MM. Complications resulting from stem cell transplant or newer therapies including chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy are beyond the scope of this review and will not be discussed here.",

There is a wide variation in data reporting on the incidence and the degree of renal failure due to differences in the definitions of renal dysfunction, sample sizes of studies, and populations assessed. Renal dysfunction occurs in more than a third to half of newly diagnosed patients (serum creatinine (sCr) above the upper normal limit or 2 mg/dL or eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Table 1 details the list of common causes of renal dysfunction encountered in clinical practice. As per the RIFLE risk category, approximately 10-15% of patients develop renal failure, and half become dialysis dependent [9, 64] . Even after an initial renal recovery with appropriate myeloma-directed therapy, more than half of patients can still develop renal failure during the disease course. In the absence of renal recovery, mortality risk is reported to be higher in this population with shortened overall survival. With novel therapies in myeloma, reversibility of renal insufficiency (RI) is associated with improved survival with some studies demonstrating similar survival in patients who recover from acute kidney injury (AKI) and those without renal impairment. Therefore, achieving renal recovery is of priority and the main goal in these patients [1, 11, 29, 43, 125] .",

The tubules eventually rupture and FLC extravasates, causing interstitial inflammation and damage.

Therapy should include aggressive resuscitation with IV fluids in efforts to maintain normal urine output, treating concomitant hypercalcemia and other electrolyte imbalances, initiating treatment of underlying infection, and avoiding nephrotoxins. A multidisciplinary approach with hematology and nephrology consults is paramount to optimize care in these patients. Suspicion of cast nephropathy in newly diagnosed myeloma patients with serum FLC above 1000 mg/L should be high, especially if associated selective proteinuria composed of FLC/BJP exists, as the degree of renal injury is usually related to tumor load [55] . A percutaneous kidney biopsy with histology is not required to initiate treatment if myeloma has been confirmed but can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis, assess concomitant light chain or amyloid deposition disease, and predict prognosis. The need for a renal biopsy should be discussed for patients with lower levels of toxic FLC, as these patients are more likely to have alternate etiologies for their RI. In patients with significant light chain burden, it is critical to begin treatment immediately with renal recovery as the major immediate goal.",

Though it takes a few days to weeks to observe the impact of chemotherapy on light chain production, current evidence suggests using hemodialysis only for clinical indications of renal replacement therapy which may exist and not solely for reduction of tumor load. Based on two randomized clinical trials, the use of high cutoff hemodialysis to rapidly reduce the load of nephrotoxic light chains may be an option in patients requiring dialysis when treated with bortezomib-based therapies, but the results may be stochastic at best [14, 22, 108] . TPE can rapidly reduce FLC loads; however its role in cast nephropathy comes from small retrospective trials which provide no data on the renal histology or SFLC levels. In studies that demonstrated benefit, obtaining a biopsy and using a proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based treatment were not uniformly applied, making interpretation of the data difficult. Especially in the era of novel drugs, the evidence in favor of TPE is limited [21, 29, 63] unless there is evidence of IgM or IgA paraproteinemia-associated hyperviscosity syndrome. The utility of urinary alkalization is debated as this theoretically decreases tubular cast formation and, however, can cause risk of renal calcium precipitation, especially if the patient presents with concurrent hypercalcemia. Acute tubular necrosis: ATN is a consequence of an already compromised renal function in patients with cast nephropathy. Hypercalcemiarelated vasoconstriction with subsequent reduced renovascular flow, dehydration, and use of loop diuretics can speed up cast formation.",

MIDD is most commonly kappa subtype, while AL amyloidosis tends to be lambda; both tend to be associated with predominant albuminuria unlike cast nephropathy. Though the most characteristic presentation is nephrotic syndrome due to glomerular involvement, patients with MIDD can have rapid deterioration of renal function which could be fatal if diagnosis is not reached in a patient presenting with new-onset renal failure. Life-threatening complications which need to be closely monitored include arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and bleeding diathesis.

Cardiac amyloidosis can be clinically silent initially, and a MM patient presenting with progressive dyspnea, worsening edema with evidence of heart failure, or dysrhythmia presenting as syncope or hypotensive event requires a thorough work-up to rule out coexisting amyloid disease. Detection of amyloid in any organ requires ruling out cardiac involvement. Other symptoms which warrant amyloid work-up include easy bruising, periorbital purpura, macroglossia (which is better appreciated when associated with tooth indentation), and carpal tunnel syndrome. Once significant symptoms of cardiac amyloid appear, most commonly related to heart failure, median survival shortens, especially in the event of a late diagnosis.

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels are elevated in cardiac amyloidosis, even in the absence of heart failure, due to regional myocardial stress due to fibrillar extracellular deposition [90] . Cardiac troponins can be elevated, even with an unremarkable coronary angiography, due to predominant deposition in the small intramural vessels sparing the epicardial arteries, but associated with nonischemic destruction of cardiomyocytes. ECG findings suggestive of cardiac involvement include a pattern of low voltage (cardiac changes from amyloid infiltration rather than myocyte hypertrophy) defined as a QRS voltage amplitude of 0.5 mV in all limb leads or 1 mV in all precordial leads (sensitivity 45-70%). This may be described as a pseudo-infarct pattern (50-75%). Atrioventricular right-or left-bundle branch blocks may also suggest cardiac amyloid. Echocardiography in advanced stages usually demonstrates a restrictive pattern due to the structural changes and increased echogenicity of the myocardium with a \"granular speckling\" (low sensitivity of 26-36% but with a high specificity (71-81%)). Cardiac MRI in advanced cardiac amyloidosis shows diffuse subendocardial heterogeneous enhancement in a nonvascular distribution on delayed contrast-enhanced MR images using inversion recovery technique. This, along with diffuse multichambered wall thickening, posterior right atrial wall thickening, or interatrial septal thickening >6 mm, is specific to amyloidosis [10, 112, 126] . Cardiac catheterization is not always required but used to obtain endomyocardial biopsy. It may help to provide important information for cardiac hemodynamics, which generally shows impaired ventricular filling with an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Demonstration of left ventricular diastolic pressure greater than right remains to distinguish restrictive cardiomyopathy from its differential diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Fine-needle aspiration of abdominal fat is relatively sensitive for amyloid deposits (>70% of patients with AL amyloidosis); other sites of amyloid deposition include minor salivary glands, gingiva, and rectum [3, 69] . In a patient with clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement, the presence of physical exam findings, blood markers, imaging, and a cardiac biopsy consistent with amyloid are adequate for diagnosis.",

Diuresis is the key and is probably the only treatment modality that can improve hemodynamics. Optimal therapy usually requires using higher doses of diuretics or in combinations (furosemide, torsemide, spironolactone, and metolazone) to maintain adequate diuresis, especially in the setting of nephrotic syndrome. An intravenous route is likely preferred in the acute stage, due to the often-present gut edema and better bioavailability. Aggressive supportive care includes maintaining strict intake output measurements, dietary salt restriction, measuring daily weights, and monitoring for arrhythmias. The uses of cardiac protective drugs such as beta-blockers should be reserved for cases of atrial fibrillation to maintain adequate filling pressure. In patients without AF, its use should be discussed on a case-by-case basis, considering the significant risks including labile blood pressure due to autonomic neuropathy and risk of bradycardia due to coexistent conduction defects. Caution should be maintained with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II inhibitors, due to similar risk of exacerbating hypotension. Both digoxin and calcium blockers, especially nifedipine, have the tendency to bind to amyloid fibrils. This can precipitate congestive heart failure due to increased susceptibility to digoxin toxicity and enhance the negative ionotropic effect with calcium channel blockers [41, 84, 107] .",

The most common atrial arrhythmia (10-15% of patients) is AF and is associated with a very high incidence of thromboembolism. In a Mayo Clinic study, cardiac amyloidosis patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography had a higher frequency of intracardiac thrombus (35%) irrespective of the presence of atrial fibrillation. Factors associated with increased risk of intracardiac thrombosis include atrial fibrillation, poor left ventricular diastolic function (grade 3 or 4), lower left atrial appendage emptying velocity (15 cm/s), increased RV wall thickness, low systolic blood pressure, and increased heart rate. This group of patients should be considered high risk for thromboembolic events and merits screening with TEE. Anticoagulation should be strongly considered in the presence of any of these risk factors due to the heightened risk for mural thrombus development and embolic events. This should be weighed against the risk of bleeding in these patients due to the potential for concomitant coagulopathy and fragile vasculature [36] .",

The role of intracardiac defibrillators is controversial due to limited evidence showing a survival benefit both for primary and secondary prevention. Several studies report ventricular arrhythmias in about a third of patients; however, this does not appear to be the leading cause of mortality in this patient group. Once congestive heart failure occurs, the clinical course for patients rapidly deteriorates, with a median survival of 6-12 months from diagnosis. Death in severe cardiac amyloid is often heralded by agonal bradycardia, followed by electromechanical dissociation or PEA. Nonetheless consensus guidelines do not support ICD placement for primary prevention of SCD in patients if life expectancy is <1 year. Hence these devices have rarely been used in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis. With improvement in the therapeutic platform of cardiac amyloidosis and improved survival, it becomes a priority to be able to select the patients that benefit from antiarrhythmic prophylaxis and primary prevention ICDs. With the available data, ICDs should be considered in cardiac amyloid patients with recurrent episodes of non-sustained VT, unexplained syncope, young age at diagnosis, early stages of disease at diagnosis with low levels of cardiac biomarkers, and prognosis >1 year [47, 48, 71, 127] .",

FDA-approved therapies in this class include bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib [93] . Among them, carfilzomib has shown the highest rates of cardiotoxicity. In a meta-analysis looking at the cardiotoxicity of carfilzomib, all-grade and high-grade cardiotoxicity were seen in 18% and 8% of patients, respectively, higher than the control arm. The most significant events included heart failure (5%), arrhythmias (2.5%), and ischemic events (2%). Rare reports of carfilzomibassociated cardiac arrests also exist. Risk can be higher in patients with comorbidities such as older age, obesity, anemia, kidney dysfunction, previous mediastinal radiation, high-dose corticosteroids, prior or concurrent anthracycline exposure, use of higher carfilzomib doses, short infusion times, and undiagnosed amyloidosis [5, 52, 92, 133, 135] . Anecdotal reports suggest bortezomib may lead to cardiotoxicity as well, although a recent meta-analysis did not find a significantly increased risk compared to the control arm [128, 136] . The first intervention in suspected cardiotoxicity is to hold further therapy and follow expectant management. In cases of congestive heart failure, once the heart failure symptoms improve, it is reasonable to restart the chemotherapy at a lower dose, with a longer infusion time and limiting peri-treatment IV fluids. Arrhythmic events would require careful consideration regarding rechallenging patients after considering the risk-benefit ratio.",

However, these levels are arbitrary, and the relationship is nonlinear as patients can have symptoms even with a level lower or could be asymptomatic with a higher level [49, 94] .

Management of acute DVT or PE involves withholding the offending drug if any and starting immediate systemic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. LMWH is the preferred anticoagulation at the time of transition to outpatient therapy as evidence suggests better safety and a superior efficacy in stabilizing the clot in comparison to other anticoagulants [67] . Factors that make oral anticoagulation less ideal is drugdrug interaction and unreliable therapeutic levels resulting from patient-related malnutrition, infection, and drug holds from cytopenias. Once full anticoagulation is attained, the immunomodulator can be reintroduced.",

Duration of anticoagulation should be a minimum of 6 months; however in the presence of the offending drug, systemic anticoagulation should be continued for the total duration of therapy [13] . Arterial thromboembolic events, though rare, have also been reported with thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide; rarely, this may present as myocardial infarction or stroke.

High incidence of early infection in MM is due to the suppressed humoral and T cell-mediated immunity by the disease itself. Immunosuppression is mediated by disease-and treatment-related factors including decreased ratio of functional to dysfunctional immunoglobulins, defects in antibody opsonization, steroid-related T cell defects, secondary immunodeficiency related to chemotherapy, restricted pulmonary reserve from thoracic rib fractures and opiate use, mucosal damage, indwelling catheters, and presence of renal failure [53, 88, 100] . Bacterial infections, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli, tend to be the predominant organisms causing infection at diagnosis, while Staphylococcus aureus and other gram-negative infections are more common in the relapsed refractory setting [109, 114] . The use of novel drugs combined with steroids has increased the rate of viral and fungal infections which can occur any time during the disease course [12, 58, 91] . Viral infections, especially herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), have increased in incidence with the introduction of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib. Viral prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir is recommended in all patients undergoing therapy with proteasome inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies. Although invasive fungal infection (approximately 2-3%) incidence is low, the mortality rate is high with approximately 60% of patients requiring ICU management. The introduction of novel agents tends to be associated with later-onset invasive fungal infections compared to studies from the conventional chemotherapy era where an earlier onset was noted [122] . Furthermore the use of long-term and high-dose dexamethasone can cause persistent defect in T cell-mediated immunity which predisposes patients to mucosal candidiasis, P. jirovecii, HSV, and VZV infections.",

Though rare, this is potentially a fatal event. A thorough microbiology screen, echocardiogram, CT imaging, autoimmune work-up, and coagulopathy work-up are warranted [115] . BAL showing presence of gross blood and the percentage of hemosiderin-laden macrophages (siderophages) >20% at BAL are suggestive of a diagnosis of DAH [25, 42, 118] . Aggressive supportive care and empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be considered. The role of early initiation of steroids is currently based on retrospective series and case reports. An MD Anderson prospective study examined 119 critically ill adult hematopoietic transplant patients treated for DAH, and on multivariate analysis, an initial medium (250-1000 mg/day) and high-dose (1000 mg/day) steroids were associated with a higher ICU mortality (P = 0.01) as compared with the low dose (<250 mg/day).

Though mechanisms are not fully elucidated, oxidative stress, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibition, fibroblast proliferation, and impairment of cell repair by epidermal growth factor receptor blocking may play a role. BAL with culture and microscopy should be able to help rule out infectious causes. The lymphocytic preponderance typically seen in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is supportive of a hypersensitivity mechanism; however, this finding is nondiagnostic and requires meticulous exclusion of other causes. Invasive procedures like biopsy usually do not provide any specific findings diagnostic for DIP and, therefore, should be obtained only on a case-by-case basis. Once DIP is suspected, stopping the offending agent is the main therapeutic approach; steroids may be used in severe cases [4, 61] . Although no guidelines exist on the duration of steroids, in general, a slow taper is recommended [61] . Caution should be maintained on rechallenging the patients with the offending medication as the risk of recurrent reaction is extremely high.",

Though the definitive approach is prompt MM treatment initiation, often due to patient frailty and concomitant organ damage, chemotherapy cannot be initiated until the patient is more stable. If the patient is on calcium, vitamin D supplements, thiazide diuretics, or any other drugs which promote hypercalcemia, they should be stopped immediately. In patients with levels >14 mg/dL or with significant symptoms, other adjunct therapies should be used as a temporizing measure. Loop diuretics, which were previously commonly used for hypercalcemia, should not be routinely used. The utility of forced saline diuresis is not consistent; with lower doses, calciuresis is an indirect effect of the accompanying natriuresis. To cause a direct calciuretic effect, doses as high as 100 mg/h is required, which can cause unwanted metabolic derangements and worsening renal cast formation with risk of worsening renal dysfunction [68] . The use of calcitonin to treat patients with hypercalcemia is limited owing to its inability to dramatically lower serum calcium levels. However, it can work synergistically with other therapies without significant adverse side effects until chemotherapy can be initiated. Calcitonin, by inhibition of bone resorption and increased renal calcium excretion, has rapid onset of action and can lower calcium levels by 1-2 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L). The dose is 4 IU/kg given subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6-12 h. The efficacy in general wears off after 2-3 days due to the escape phenomenon (tachyphylaxis) of the calcitonin sensing receptors [65] . Preclinical studies suggest tachyphylaxis can be prevented with the addition of corticosteroids [27, 65, 129] . With its anti-MM effect, adding corticosteroids can add to the synergy to this combination in the treatment of hypercalcemia.",

Bisphosphonates have an established role in severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia, but often it is challenging to administer them upfront for MM patients due to the renal function-based dose limitation [19] . It also has slow onset of action and reaches peak in about 2-5 days; therefore it needs to be used in a combinatorial approach. Denosumab, on the other hand, has a renally independent clearance mechanism and hence does not require kidney functionbased dosing adjustments. It is currently FDA approved to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy and is dosed at 120 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks with additional doses of 120 mg on days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy [37, 50] .

There are reports of bortezomib, thalidomide, and steroid associated TLS [23, 38] . Tumor lysis syndrome manifests due to lysis of massive numbers of tumor cells releasing intracellular potassium and phosphorous causing hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. This causes calcium to precipitate as calcium phosphate in tissues causing secondary hypocalcemia. Hyperuricemia results from the breakdown of nucleic acids in the tumor cells. The resultant metabolic derangement, if left untreated, can progress to kidney failure, mental status changes, seizures, arrhythmias, and even death. Diagnosing TLS can be challenging in patients with MM due to its uncommon association and often seen associated renal insufficiency [131] . It is imperative for clinicians to be aware of this complication in MM patients undergoing treatment with novel combinations.

It is vital to recognize the symptoms early, with prompt imaging since the strongest predictor of neurologic outcome with treatment is the neurologic status when treatment is initiated [77] . Clinical features depend on the site and degree of involvement. A new-onset back pain or a worsening of an existing pain in a MM patient should prompt a work-up to rule this out. Pain can be localized or radiating which usually worsens with lying down. Associated bowel and bladder dysfunction is present in about half of the cases [44] . If treatment is delayed, myelopathy progresses to loss of sensory and motor function leading to paraplegia. Spinal cord injury at the cervical level is uncommon; however, if affected above C4-C5, it results in respiratory, cardiac, and autonomic decompensation [86] . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the initial gold standard imaging modality as it can aid in the thorough evaluation of spine, degree of tumor or fracture involvement, and for radiation planning [59] . The safety of MRI should be discussed in the presence of pacemakers and defibrillators in a multidisciplinary fashion, and if contraindicated, CT myelography should be performed.",

The optimal management depends on the extent of disease, performance status of the patient, and presence of spine instability. Immediate therapeutic strategies involve achieving minimal mobility until stability of the spine is achieved. Steroids should be initiated even while awaiting diagnostic study results (dexamethasone at doses 10 mg IV followed by 16 mg daily in divided doses with a taper over 2 weeks) [137] . Doses as high as 100 mg initial bolus were used in the past, but are not used any more due to risk of significant side effects and limited evidence to suggest benefit [45] . Spine stabilization by reducing the mechanical load can be achieved with the use of a neck collar (e.g., Philadelphia collar) in case of cervical spine or braces at other sites and is not generally recommended for longer than 3 months [87] . A thorough baseline neurological exam followed by serial neurological exams should be done to assess clinical status.",

In a retrospective study which included 63 patients with MM/lymphoma treated with RT alone, 76% of the patients experienced an improvement in motor function, 22% had no change, while 2% deteriorated. In this group, patients who experienced slowly progressive motor deficit defined as time of onset >14 days had better response rates than patients who had fast onset deficit defined as time of onset <14 days. The improvements in motor function in these groups were 80% and 70%, respectively. No patients who received radiotherapy progressed in the slow onset motor weakness group [103, 104] . Current evidence does not support resorting to surgery in patients with ESCC, as most MM cases respond to radiation. The need for surgical stabilization with fixation or by percutaneous repair is in general reserved for cases with spine instability or spine compression from a vertebral body. Treatment of the underlying malignancy with systemic chemotherapy or novel agents, bone-modifying agents, and neurorehabilitation can help in recovery of the vertebral and spinal damage [72, 101] .",

            "text": "CNS myelomatosis: Neurological symptoms in MM are most commonly due to hypercalcemia, cord compression, anti-MM drug related, hyperviscosity, or amyloid-related neuropathy. Direct involvement by malignant cells of the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system, unlike lymphoma, is uncommon in MM. Direct CNS involvement in MM often presents as leptomeningeal myelomatosis (LMM), intraparenchymal metastasis, cranial nerve involvement, or radiculopathy [54, 95, 117] . Though conventional wisdom would suggest CNS involvement is seen later during the disease, most patients present relatively early with median time of diagnosis of LMD around 9 months from MM diagnosis. Hence the risk is unlikely only related to improved survival in MM patients but also due to an aggressive early biology. Supporting this contention, CNS involvement is reported mostly in patients with high-risk MM with heavy tumor burden, plasmablastic morphology, or plasma cell leukemia [138] . Patients often present with focal weakness, cranial nerve palsies, mental status changes, speech and gait disturbances, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, and/or seizures. CSF examination reveals pleocytosis, increased protein levels higher than 100 g/dL, presence of monoclonal plasma cells, and in some cases an increased opening pressure. The diagnosis is usually reached with the first analysis of CSF [78] . MRI imaging with and without contrast would aid in identifying the presence and extent of the disease. In the presence of symptoms, steroids can help in alleviating the symptoms and reducing intracranial pressure. Therapy involves strategies similar to that used for other hematological malignancies with CNS involvement, including intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial irradiation with systemic chemotherapy. Despite majority of patients achieving CSF clearance with CNS-directed therapy showing significant potential for symptom improvement, the overall prognosis is grim with the currently approved therapies in MM. The median survival ranges from 3 to 6 months, with a small fraction surviving past 2 years [75] . Hence it is paramount to have a thorough discussion on the goals of therapy once CNS involvement is diagnosed [17, 34] .",

Anemia (Hb > 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal or a hemoglobin value <10 g/ dL) is a common complication seen in 70-80% MM patients at presentation and in nearly all patients at some point in the disease course [64] . Several factors drive anemia in MM patients which include bone marrow involvement, low serum erythropoietin level due to kidney dysfunction, hemolysis, impaired availability of storage iron, and anti-MM treatment-related bone marrow suppression. An aggressive anti-MM treatment approach despite the severity of anemia is warranted in patients with anemia suspected to be from MM. This is likely encountered in most cases of newly diagnosed MM. Myeloma therapy often worsens the anemia, before it improves once myeloma responds. These patients should be closely monitored for transfusion requirement. No universal guidelines exist for transfusion goals. In general, leukoreduced and irradiated blood is used for transfusion for hemoglobin level <7-8 g/dL or symptomatic anemia. The transfusion goal can vary in the presence of other comorbidities such as cardiac ischemia, active bleeding, or if symptoms due to hypoperfusion are present. A major proportion of patients with MM who have chronic anemia are those with long-standing disease in partial remission or stable response. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are not routinely used, except in this population after careful selection, to improve the ongoing anemia despite chemotherapy.",

One should strongly consider ruling out TMA as it has been reported with novel drugs and with older chemotherapeutic agents; two notable novel drugs are bortezomib and carfilzomib, and a chemotherapeutic agent is cisplatin. Prompt discontinuation of these medications is warranted if the medication is suspected to be the likely culprit. Plasmapheresis is initiated in most of patients, and eculizumab has been tried in a small number of patients. The role of these two therapies in malignancy-associated TMA is controversial and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis [51, 102, 121, 140] .",
