Although the benefits of running are numerous, there is a risk of Running Related Injuries (RRI) of the lower extremities. Electromyography (EMG) techniques have previously been used to study causes of RRIs, but the complexity of this technology limits its use to a laboratory setting. As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology acts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study presents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of jogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of recording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the device, a proof of concept study consisting of N = 2 runners performing a set of 5 km running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on muscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that muscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable device, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the likelihood of suffering from RRIs.",

The wearable sEMG device allows collection of long term EMG data in a great variety of environments due to its compact design. Furthermore, use of the device does not require extensive prior anatomical knowledge, as the sensing electrodes are embroidered into the garment at the correct locations, following standards set by the SENIAM project [5] .

In this paper, the device is demonstated as a platform for monitoring muscle fatigue during endurancebased long distance (5 km) running tests on different surfaces (asphalt, sand and an athletics track). Using data from the device, the dependency between running surface and muscle fatigue is identified, whereby running on compliant surfaces with greater damping (e.g., sand) leads to the highest levels of muscle fatigue, followed by very stiff surfaces with little damping features (e.g., asphalt). These results confirm expectations about likelihood of suffering from RRIs on these different surfaces, and highlight the use of the proposed device for long term observation of behaviour.

The difference between the signals collected by each of the two electrodes is amplified. Current commercial systems such as BTS Surface EMG (Vandrico, North Vancouver, Canada), and Tringo Wireless EMG (DelSys, massachusetts, USA) offer wireless EMG solutions. However, these present several disadvantages: (i) they are expensive (ranging from e448.00 to e15,675.00), (ii) they are bulky (reducing their portability and affecting natural user motion), and (iii) they rely on gel-based sEMG electrodes requiring anatomical knowledge for their placement and limiting their re-usability.",

Regarding the spectral analysis, muscle fatigue results in a left-shifting of the power spectrum of the EMG signal and hence a decrement of the instantaneous mean and median frequencies is seen. Finally, for timefrequency analysis, the wavelets ratios increase their value as the muscles get fatigued.

As a precursor to this study, experiments were performed to elucidate the best fabrication process and design of these electrodes and characterise their behaviour for sEMG signal acquisition. Results show that similar sEMG measurements can be obtained by using conductive textile electrodes in place of gel-based disposable electrodes [14] . Comparisons between the developed stainless-steal threadbased sEMG electrodes (using conductive thread Sparkfun DEV-11791, 3.28 \u2126 m \u22121 ) and standard gel-based electrodes (Covidien Kendall Arbo H124SG) show that, while there is greater noise presence when using textile-based electrodes, muscle activity can still be observed and different levels of muscle engagement distinguished. For this paper, this technology is exploited to enable long term wearable measurement of muscle activity through an integrated textile device recording sEMG of the quadriceps muscles.",

The placement area is tightened using extra thick felt fabric to enhance the contact with the skin tissue. European medium (M) leggings size is selected and the in leg longitude of the participants' leg measured to assure the location of the sensors to be the one outlined by the SENIAM project. To prevent voltage loss due to the high resistance of the conductive thread, the length of the connection lines is limited to 20 cm for which voltage losses are negligible. A double stitching pattern along with a zig-zag pattern ensured robust and stretchable connection lines. The leggings are powered at \u00b13.75 V using a single rechargeable battery of 7.5 V. Fig. 2 shows the final stages of the fabrication process. Silicone sealant (102 RTV, Hylomar) is used to isolate the connections of the power unit.

Fig. 4 shows the iARV for participant 1 whilst running on the three different surfaces. As explained in \u00a7II, the amplitude of the sEMG signal increases in presence of muscle fatigue as more muscle fibres are recruited. This phenomena is observed for the three surfaces with varying rates of increase, as the iARV value of the sEMG signal increases with time. Table 2 seen that running on the sand surface leads to the maximum amplitude increment of the iARV signal for the three muscles whereas the athletics track led to the minimum increase after the 5 km trials.

This section discusses these issues, and their likely effect on the results presented so far. 1) Second wind effect: Looking at the signals in Fig. 4 , it can be observed that the iARV is greater at the beginning of all the trials and then decreases progressively before increasing in presence of muscle fatigue. This can be explained as a result of the second wind effect, which increases the serotonin levels of the participant after the first minutes of running [17] . This results in a decrement of the fatigue levels of the muscles at the beginning of an exercise.",

            "text": "2) Effect of Perspiration: The second issue relates to the effect of perspiration on the data recorded. During the course of experiments involving physical activity, the conductivity the user's skin tissue varies linearly with the number of active sweating glands [18] . In other words, the higher the sweating levels of the participant are, the more conductive their skin will be. In the device created for this study, the conductive thread wiring is not insulated and hence the conductance of the wiring changes, altering the behaviour of the circuit by increasing the inherent offset at the output of the PCBs. This phenomena is observed for all the trials and is particularly noticeable for the Vastus group muscles. Note that, the outdoor temperature for the first two trials (asphalt and sand) on the day of collecting data was 18 \u2022 C and 17 \u2022 C respectively whereas 27 \u2022 C was registered during the athletics track trial suggesting higher sweating levels during the last trial and, therefore, a greater percentage increase of the iARV signal. This suggests that the athletics track might result in lower fatigue levels than the ones measured. In spite of this phenomena, the classification of the surfaces remains the same as the athletics track still led to the lowest levels of muscle fatigue independently of the effect of the sweating.",

This equipment is then used in an outdoors setting to elucidate muscle fatigue. The results showed that different levels of muscle fatigue could be detected when running on different surfaces. They matched the expectations that running on the athletics track leads to the lowest levels of muscle fatigue, followed by the asphalt track and finally by the sand track as a direct consequence of muscle activity as outlined in [4] .
