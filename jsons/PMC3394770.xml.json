Many proteins, namely wound-inducible proteins, are expressed to prevent pathogen infection, inhibit digestion by insects, and repair injured tissues [1], [2]. One group of wound-inducible proteins is lectin, the carbohydrate binding protein [3], [4]. Plant lectins are involved in the plant defense mechanism because of carbohydrate binding properties [5]\u2013[9]. The toxicity of lectins was also confirmed in animal experiments [10], [11]. Plant lectins show resistance to digestive enzymes and can bind selectively to the carbohydrate moieties of gut epithelial cells to interfere in nutrient digestion and absorption [12], so they could be a natural insecticide. In addition, plant lectins have been used for blood typing and immunological assay. The lectin concanavalin A is commercially used in affinity chromatography for purifying glycoproteins. Plant lectins have long been reported as potential inhibitors of viruses [13]\u2013[17].",

Accumulating data have revealed that plants ubiquitously synthesize lectins in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. These inducible lectins are synthesized and then exported to vacuoles by signal peptides or reside in the cytoplasm [18], [19]. The physiological function of plant lectins for subcellular localization remains obscure. However, the major assumption is that lectins are involved in defense and may also have a role in signal transduction for response to stress [20]. Structure analysis of plant lectins demonstrated a diverse group of proteins that can be classified into 6 different groups (http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines/): monocot lectin, hevein domain lectins, \u03b2-prism lectins, \u03b2-trefoil lectins, cyanovirin-N homologs, and legume lectin.",

In 1996, the structure of Jacalin from seed of jackfruit (Artocarpus integrifolia) was first reported to have a tetrameric association for binding to galactose [21]. Later, Maclura pomifera seed agglutinin was reported to have the same tetrameric structure as Jacalin [22]. The other lectin, Artocarpin, from seed of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) shares the same tetrameric association for binding to mannose [23]. Moringa M from black mulberry (Morus nigra) forms a tetrameric association like that of Jacalin [24]. JRLs were once thought to be confined to the Moraceae. However, increasing structural evidence reveals that the lectins with a \u03b2-prism fold exist universally in plants and animals [25] but with different quaternary association. Heltuba is a plant tuber lectin from Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke) that has a donut shape with an octahedral assembly by the \u03b2-prism building block [26]. Caselpa is a rhizome lectin from Calystegia sepium (Hedge bindweed) that has a dimeric form [27]. PPL is a plant seed lectin from Parkia platycephala that contains 3 repetitive \u03b2-prism domains and forms a dimeric form with hexahedral assembly [28].",

In this study, we resolved the crystal structures of IPO in the apo form and in complex with Me-Man, Me-Glc and methyl \u03b1-D-galactopyranoside (Me-Gal) to reveal the different quaternary associations of IPO and its binding pocket for carbohydrates. A truncated IPO (\u0394N10IPO) was prepared to reveal its role in tetrameric association in solution by gel filtration chromatography. In addition, the carbohydrate binding constants of IPO and \u0394N10IPO were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). \u0394N10IPO showed a recovered mannose/glucose-specific lectin. Structural and functional analysis identified IPO as a member of the JRL family but with a different tetrameric association.

We obtained a retarded result, with corresponding molecular mass 4.0 kDa (Peak 3 in Figure 4A). Thus, IPO has the binding ability of dextran in the matrix of the Superdex 200 column. To eliminate the binding effect of IPO to dextran, running buffer was prepared with an additional 0.2 M Me-Glc, and a shift of the IPO peak could be observed, with corresponding molecular mass of 53.3 kDa (Peak 2 in Figure 4A). Consequently, running buffer with an additional 1 M glucose was prepared to totally eliminate the binding effect of IPO. The corresponding molecular mass of IPO in solution was 64.7 kDa (Peak 1 in Figure 4A). The molecular mass of recombinant IPO with a His tag was 17.3 kDa for a monomer and 69.2 kDa for a tetramer.

A previous report indicated that the buried interface of the Calsepa dimer is 1,327 \u00c52 by a probe with 1.6 \u00c5 radius [27]. Here, we analyzed the buried interface of the selected structures from the above comparison by using the PDBe PISA service with 1.4 \u00c5 radius [34]. The buried interface area from tetrameric IPO encompasses 1,539 \u00c52, which is larger than that of Calsepa (1,202 \u00c52), PPL (1,294 \u00c52), Banlec (750 \u00c52), Heltuba (736 \u00c52), and Jacalin (1023 \u00c52). The N terminus of the protomer in the JRL family has an important role in the quaternary association by swapping in the interface and then forming a dimer, tetramer, hexamer, and octomer. To compare the difference between the tetrameric Jacalin (Figure S1A) and the tetrameric IPO (Figure S1C), the tetramer of Jacalin showed a looser interface than that of IPO. Therefore, IPO formed a different compact tetramer.",

The C4 atom of Me-Glc and Me-Gal could form one hydrogen bond with the amine group of Gly21 of IPO and one hydrogen bond with the \u03b2-carboxylic group of Asp145 of IPO (Figure 3A and Figure 3D).

No interaction between \u0394N10IPO and Me-Gal was observed. \u0394N10IPO could be recovered as the mannose/glucose specific lectin if \u0394N10IPO represented the monomeric IPO and wild-type IPO represented the tetrameric IPO. The monomeric IPO showed 5 times and 6 times binding affinity to Me-Man and Me-Glc, respectively, as compared with those of tetrameric IPO. Therefore, the N terminus of IPO is involved in the carbohydrate recognition, which results in the carbohydrate binding polyspecificity of tetrameric IPO. From the tetrameric IPO structure, the residue Leu5 and His8 in the N terminus of monomer B (chain B) forms 3 hydrogen bonds with the residue Asn19 in the loop between \u03b23 and \u03b24 of monomer A (chain A) (Figure 8). The hydrogen bonds might pull out the loop of \u03b23-\u03b24 and form a larger binding cavity for different carbohydrates in monomer A. However, in \u0394N10IPO, the hydrogen bonds would disappear and might relocate the \u03b23-\u03b24 loop to cause a smaller binding cavity. The axial O4 of Me-Gal would not easily enter into the smaller binding cavity. The results might be confirmed by the crystal structure of \u0394N10IPO\u2013Me-Man in further study.",

In addition, the binding pocket of IPO was identified and found to bind to Me-Glc, Me-Man, and Me-Gal with similar hydrogen bond networks. Furthermore, the binding constants of IPO were determined by ITC. The IPO structures further extend the diverse quaternary structures of the JRL family of plants and show versatile carbohydrate binding properties regulated by the N terminus.

The amino acid sequence of Calystegia sepium agglutinin (Calsepa), a JRL (PDB: 1OUW), showed 53% sequence identity to that of IPO. The monomeric structure of Calsepa was further used in a search to determine the structure of apo IPO by molecular replacement with use of the program CNS [39]. After cross-rotation and translation of molecular replacement, 4 values were obtained. Initial rigid body refinement for the 4 monomeric structures gave a 48.8% R-factor. Clear continuous electron density could be observed after calculation of Fourier maps, and the 5th molecule of apo IPO was further built accordingly. Because of different space groups for the structures of the IPO\u2013Me-Man, IPO\u2013Me-Glc and IPO\u2013Me-Gal complexes, the resolved monomeric apo IPO was used as a search template in the following molecular replacement method. The solutions of cross-rotation and translation could be obtained with 2 molecules for the IPO\u2013Me-Man complex, 4 molecules for IPO\u2013Me-Glc and 4 molecules for IPO\u2013Me-Gal. Those solutions were further applied to initial rigid body refinement, and reasonable values were obtained (e.g., 36.7% R-factor for IPO\u2013Me-Man, 35.4% for IPO\u2013Me-Glc, and 32.9% for IPO\u2013Me-Gal).",
