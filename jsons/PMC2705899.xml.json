            "text": "After four decades of effective use of the adamantane class of antiviral drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza, global resistance to these drugs has increased dramatically among influenza viruses of the A/H3N2 subtype in recent years. In the vast majority of cases, the basis for resistance is a single Ser to Asn amino acid replacement (S31N) in the matrix M2 ion channel, which interferes with the drug's ability to block M2 ion channel activity and viral replication (Wang et al., 1993, Aoki, 1998). Whereas < 2% of A/H3N2 influenza viruses sampled globally were resistant to adamantane during 1995\u20132002, resistance was detected among 12.3% of viruses collected in 2004 (Bright et al., 2005). Sharp increases in adamantane resistance first appeared in Asia, particularly in China, where the prevalence of resistance increased from 8.2% in 2002 to 73.8% in 2004, and also in Hong Kong (69.8% resistance in 2004) (Bright et al., 2005). Recently, the S31N mutation was detected in 100% of influenza viruses sampled from multiple Asian countries, although sample sizes were relatively small (Deyde et al., 2007). In the United States, adamantane resistant influenza viruses emerged somewhat later, with prevalence increasing from < 2% in 2003 to 11% in 2004\u20132005, and over 90% during the 2005\u20132006 epidemic (Bright et al., 2005, Bright et al., 2006). Since 2006 the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the cessation of use of adamantanes for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (CDC 2006).",

Although mutations conferring drug resistance emerge readily when adamantanes are administered to control influenza outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities (Shiraishi et al., 2003, Suzuki et al., 2003), resistant strains typically persist only transiently. Accordingly, the prevalence of resistance to adamantane at a population level has remained low for many decades (< 2%), despite periods of significant adamantane usage in certain areas, such as Japan in the late 1990s (Ziegler et al., 1999, Masuda et al., 2000).",

In particular, it has been proposed that the increased global frequency of the S31N mutation in the M2 protein resulted from a chance hitchhiking event involving linkage to advantageous mutations in other segments following a major 4 + 4 reassortment event, including mutations in HA1 at positions 193 and 225 near the receptor-binding site (Simonsen et al., 2007). This reassortment event, which most likely occurred in early 2005, generated a new global lineage of adamantane resistant A/H3N2 viruses, termed the \u2018N-lineage\u2019, characterized by an antigenically A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like HA and an M2 protein bearing the S31N replacement (Simonsen et al., 2007). Further characterization of influenza viruses circulating globally identified additional independent introductions of resistant A/H3N2 influenza viruses that emerged prior to the emergence of the \u2018N-lineage\u2019, but which did not spread globally (Deyde et al., 2007). However, the specific roles of local evolution, migration, and reassortment in the genesis of adamantane resistance in years prior to the global emergence of the \u2018N-lineage\u2019 are unknown.",

            "text": "Although reassortment and genomic hitchhiking appear to be important in the global dissemination of A/H3N2 adamantane resistant viruses to North America and Oceania, it is possible that localized direct selection pressure for drug resistance underlies the initial emergence of adamantane resistance in South-East Asia. In particular, the over-the-counter use of adamantane drugs may have increased in some areas, including China, possibly in association with the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H5N1 avian influenza virus (Bright et al., 2006, Deyde et al., 2007, Hayden, 2006). Furthermore, it has been proposed that South-East Asia serves as an epicenter for continuous influenza virus activity, with antigenic variants emerging in tropical South-East Asian countries before disseminating globally (Russell et al., 2008). According to the \u2018source-sink\u2019 model of influenza A virus evolution, tropical regions in general support continual viral activity, greater genetic diversity, and consequently stronger natural selection, whereas epidemics in temperate areas repeatedly die out due to strong seasonal bottlenecks and require continual re-seeding (Rambaut et al., 2008, Nelson et al., 2007, Nelson et al., 2006, Tang et al., 2008a). Overall, the seasonality of influenza in the tropics is less defined than in temperate regions but in some areas is associated with high rainfall (Shek and Lee 2003).",

Given the early detection of adamantane resistant viruses in China and Hong Kong (Bright et al., 2005) and the prominence of South-East Asia in global influenza virus evolution (Russell et al., 2008), we sought to investigate the specific role of Hong Kong in the origin and rapid global dissemination of adamantane resistant viruses between 1997 and 2007. As drug selection pressure alone inadequately explains the global domination of adamantane resistant viruses in temperate countries where adamantane usage has not increased in recent years, we explored how the interaction between local evolution, genomic reassortment, and ongoing antigenic change more completely explains the rapid global dissemination of adamantane resistance. In particular, to understand the global emergence of the S31N adamantane resistance mutation within the context of antigenic evolution, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of influenza virus sequence data for the HA, M1/2, and NA segments that was obtained through ten years of sampling in both subtropical and temperate regions.",

In Australia and New Zealand, 6.2% (39 / 629) of isolates were resistant to adamantane drugs, 4.5% (22 / 492) of the isolates from New York State, USA were adamantane resistant, and 20.6% (58 / 281) of Hong Kong isolates were resistant (Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). In the years prior to the global proliferation of adamantane resistance viruses associated the emergence of the \u2018N-lineage\u2019 in early 2005 (Simonsen et al., 2007), the overall prevalence of adamantane resistance in our data set was 3.0% (38 / 1250): 11.0% (27 / 246) in Hong Kong, 0.6% (3 / 533) in New Zealand/Australia, and 1.7% (8 / 471) in New York State. Following the emergence of the \u2018N-lineage\u2019 in 2005, the prevalence of resistance increased to 53.3% (81 / 119): 88.6% (31 / 35) in Hong Kong, 66.7% (14 / 21) in New York, and 37.5% (36 / 96) in Australia and New Zealand. The prevalence of resistance is somewhat lower in New Zealand due to the paucity of isolates from 2006 to 2007.",

For example, at least four distinct lineages of A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates and four distinct lineages of A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates co-circulate on both the M1/2 and NA phylogenies, as indicated by the phylogenetically divergent clusters of isolates shaded in pink and light green, respectively, on the M1/2 and NA trees (Fig. 1, Fig. 3).

However, all A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates from Oceania that emerge in the summer of 2003 are reassortant, with NA and M1/2 segments that derive from the major clade of A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates. Reassortant A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates are subsequently detected in New York State and Hong Kong during the 2003\u20132004 season. These reassortant M1/2 and NA lineages continue to circulate for at least a year (last detected in October 2004 in Australia) before dying off during a purging of genetic diversity associated with the selective sweep of the A/California/7/2004-like viruses (Rambaut et al., 2008).",

This reassortment event is evidenced by the phylogenetic distance on the HA tree between two sets of isolates that are both closely related on the M1/2 tree in association with Introduction #7 (Fig. 2, Fig. 1, respectively). On the HA tree, one of these sets clearly is A/Fujian/411/2002-like (\u2018#7F\u2019, Fig. 2), while the other is A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like (\u2018#7W\u2019, Fig. 2). In addition, the four phylogenetically distinct clusters of \u2018#7F\u2019 isolates on the HA tree suggest that A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates may have acquired the #7 S31N introduction through multiple additional reassortment events. The phylogenetic divergence between two clusters of \u2018#7F\u2019 isolates is particularly pronounced on the NA tree (\u2018#7F1\u2019 and \u2018#7F2\u2019, Fig. 3), providing clear evidence of reassortment in this case.",

An expanded phylogenetic analysis of the M1/2 segment that includes additional adamantane resistant isolates collected globally from 1997 to 2007, mainly from South-East Asia from 2003 to 2005, indicates that the \u2018N-lineage\u2019 circulated widely in South-East Asia during the late spring and summer of 2005, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Macau (Supplementary Fig. 1).

By tracing the evolution of adamantane resistance among three geographically and climatically distinct localities for the HA, M1/2, and NA segments, we are able to determine evolutionary processes operating at both regional and global scales. Given that the therapeutic usage of adamantane drugs has been at a constant and relatively low level for many decades in temperate areas, including the United States, simple models based on local drug selection pressures alone inadequately explain the rapid rise in the global prevalence of adamantane resistance in recent years. Rather, we find that the emergence and spread of adamantane resistance appears to be a complex evolutionary process that includes geographically variable selection pressures, extensive global migration, and frequent reassortment.",

This estimate is also conservative, given the limitations of our sampling and our capacity to identify additional de novo introductions among genetically related resistant isolates. As several introductions of the resistant S31N mutation were detected in elderly patients in temperate regions where adamantane is more frequently administered to seniors (Cohen et al., 2008, Couch, 2000), it is possible that intra-host selection was involved in a number of these introductions. However, 10/11 of these introductions were represented by no more than three isolates in each case, suggesting that these introductions experienced only limited in spread in our studied population, and that drug selection pressure alone was insufficient to increase the prevalence of S31N.",

Although our data set is limited to the HA, NA, and M1/2 segments, we were still able to observe a number of reassortment events among these three genome segments. While genetic diversity appears to be more limited in the HA, presumably due to strong immune selection pressures, multiple divergent lineages co-circulated on the NA and M1/2 phylogenies prior to the selective sweep associated with the emergence of A/California/7/2004-like viruses that has been described previously (Rambaut et al., 2008). It is this long-term preservation of genetic diversity in the M1/2 segment that allows for the continued circulation of both adamantane sensitive and adamantane resistant influenza viruses to the present day. Indeed, just as influenza viruses acquired adamantane resistance through reassortment in 2005, it has been observed that resistant influenza viruses may re-acquire drug sensitivity through reassortment with adamantane sensitive lineages that continue to co-circulate in both the United States (Nelson et al., 2008) and in Japan (Furuse et al., 2008).",

Although our inclusion of background global sequences from South-East Asia in our expanded phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 1) suggests that Hong Kong is likely to be representative of the South-East Asian region for the purposes of this study, intensive sampling from additional localities in South-East Asia is greatly needed to understand the evolutionary dynamics in this critical region.

A total of 485 influenza A/H3N2 viruses from 1997 to 2006 were sampled from all 11 regions in New York State, USA, and were collected by the Virus Reference and Surveillance Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health.
