Certain peculiarities in the care of patients with COVID\u201019 differing from the usual nursing care have emerged from our experience as nurse educators who are usually working in the University but have returned to the bedside in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the Italian outbreak.",

The clinical presentation of these patients ranges from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (Huang et al., 2020), therefore airway and breathing management is the main concern. Subsequently, clinical management, such as oxygen, antiviral drugs, antibiotic prophylaxis, invasive and non\u2010invasive ventilation, patient positioning, as well as all safety procedures for the infection control (Sorbello et al., 2020, Jansson et al., 2020) are fully addressed. Unfortunately, ensuring toileting needs and personal cleansing (e.g., mouth care), that have been both reported to be delayed or missed in \u2018normal\u2019 times (Richards et al., 2018), appear to be more at risk to be omitted due to the patient\u2019s acute illness and the increased nursing workload and shortage of nurses (Giusti, 2020). Alongside these needs, other concerns regarding surveillance are emerging, as in the case of pressure ulcer risk in patients in the prone position or with a prolonged use of non-invasive ventilation devices. Moreover, some medical treatments, such as administration of continuous positive airway pressure, may hinder patients\u2019 needs such as eating and drinking or patient comfort, as the nurse may not be immediately available to provide for these needs. Similarly, promoting adequate rest and sleep is also challenging in the overwhelmed wards struggling with COVID-19 (Sorbello et al., 2020).",

Nurses must protect themselves from the airborne pathogen, requiring masks, goggles and/or face shields (Jansson et al., 2020); this prevents the nurse from speaking normally and being close to the patients for a long time. Moreover, personal protective equipment creates additional barriers to communication and reduces the opportunity to identify and discern the health professionals\u2019 role. In the COVID-19 wards, confidentiality and privacy may always not be respected. In the effort to admit newly infected patients, nurses attempt to create an environment capable of offering more beds than the hospital is used to providing, thus generating unavoidably overcrowded rooms. As nurses are following strict safety protocols and procedures, patients\u2019 interests (e.g., move freely around the wards) and priorities (e.g., keeping and using personal possessions) are at risk not to be considered and accommodated; this is a situation that may leave patients\u2019 psychological needs compromised.",

The nurse is then left with the issue of how to help the patient cope and stay calm. For example, some patients are able to receive information using mobile phones, tablets and computers, however these resources are currently scarce and not available to all patients. Even if this is available, the news is far from reassuring reporting alarming information such as daily deaths and numbers of new cases. As a consequence, feelings of helplessness and stigma, as well as higher levels of stress and anxiety among hospitalised patients may emerge (Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, emotional and social support has to be considered among both the short and the long-term goals to improve psychological resilience during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially among older people. Lastly, we have to consider the right to die with dignity in this pandemic era (Pattison, 2020): in the dying phase, no family can see their loved one, as rigorous measures have to be carried out due to orders to avoid physical contact.",
