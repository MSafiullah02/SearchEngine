            "text": "The overall prevalence of the disease varies in different regions of the globe, ranging from 15/100 000 to 250/100 000 (Kingwell et al., 2013; Rosati, 2001). According to WHO, it is estimated that more than 2 million people worldwide suffer from multiple sclerosis (MS) and the disease is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults. Some have suggested that this variability follows a certain pattern greatly depended on the latitude of each country (Figure 1\n). However, epidemiological data depict that the disease varies greatly between areas of similar latitude (Ebers and Sadovnick, 1993). Nevertheless, MS prevalence is higher in Northern than in Southern Europe, as it is in the Americas (Table 1\n). This is most likely due to differences in the ethnicity of the populations: MS is much more frequent in people of Scandinavian (either direct or indirect) descent including Americans in the northern states. On the other hand, the prevalence is high in \u2018southern\u2019 countries, such as Croatia, Israel, Kuwait, and South Africa. There is a great difference in MS prevalence between geographically close areas, such as Malta and Sicilia or Sardinia. The disease is extremely rare in Hindus living in Mumbai, but not uncommon in Parsis living in the same city. Almost no cases of MS have been reported in North or South American Indians, in Samis (Lapps), Eskimos, Australian Aborigines, Maoris, Melanesians, Micronesians, or Polynesians. MS is also extremely rare in black Africans. Israel is a good paradigm to evaluate the variable incidence of MS in subpopulations at the same geographical region and under similar environmental conditions, since there are distinct and well-distinguished ethnic groups living in the country and new immigrants arriving from countries in which the prevalence of MS is variable. The prevalence of MS is three times higher in the Jewish than in the Arab population. The disease is also three times more frequent in Askenazy Jews as compared to those of Sefaradic origin (Alter et al., 2006).",

They include the varicella zoster (Sotelo et al., 2007, 2008), corona viruses, measles, Epstein\u2013Barr, herpes simplex type 6, and canine distemper viruses; the human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-l, an \u2018MS-associated agent\u2019; and, most recently, Chlamydia. None of these has been confirmed, but the idea is mainly based on the mechanism of molecular mimicry, that is, the molecular similarities between antigens on the surface of bacteria or viruses and self-myelin proteins, leading therefore to a false response against myelin, in genetically susceptible individuals. The seasonal variations in MS exacerbations and the somehow increased incidence following vaccinations may also support the infectious theory (Sibley and Foley, 1965; Goodkin and Hertsgaard, 1989; Andersen et al., 1993; Kriesel et al., 2004; Kriesel and Sibley, 2005; Kneider et al., 2009; De Keyser et al., 1998; Sibley et al., 1985; Correale et al., 2006; Banwell et al., 2007; Edwards et al., 1998; Pohl et al., 2006; Alotaibi et al., 2004; Buljevac et al., 2005, 2003; Horakova et al., 2013; Kvistad et al., 2014; Lindsey et al., 2009; Ordonez et al., 2004; Burgoon et al., 2009; Leibovitch and Jacobson, 2014; Mulvey et al., 2011; Karussis and Petrou, 2014; Simpson et al., 2014). In the latter case (of vaccinations) the pathogenetic mechanism may involve bystander activation of the immune system, due to adjuvants that are used in the preparation of vaccines.",

This event could be an infection, which need not be symptomatic, or a vaccination. The MS may become symptomatic, remain asymptomatic, or be manifested only by lesions visible by MRI (RIS). It is likely that the development of the MS \u2018trait,\u2019 defined as \u2018activation,\u2019 occurs early in life, whereas the transition from MS trait to MS (i.e.,\u2018acquisition\u2019) takes place at puberty in most patients, when the immune system is made more vulnerable by the outpouring of female sex hormones.",

Following activation by the macrophages and dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells: APC), Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, which express the antigens specific for myelin, T-cell receptors (TCR), proliferate and begin to express on their membranes, adhesion molecules, and chemokine receptors that enhance their ability to extravasate to the site of inflammation in the CNS (Sharief et al., 1993a, Sharief et al., 1993b; Tsukada et al., 1993a, Tsukada et al., 1993b, Tsukada et al., 1993c; Washington et al., 1994) (and to produce interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) and interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) (pro-inflammatory cytokines)). This migration possibly follows \u2018damage signals\u2019 from the CNS tissue or is due to an opening/destruction of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Adhesion molecules such as VLA4 are crucially important for this process and their blockage may prevent the extravasation of the lymphocytes through the blood vessels' endothelium (Yednock et al., 1992; Polman et al., 2006). Interestingly, the best existing evidence that MS is indeed an autoimmune disease and that the whole process is initiated in the periphery comes from the reported evidence of high efficacy in MS (and the \u2018rebound\u2019 of MS activity following their discontinuation) of medications that specifically block the migration of the lymphocytes into the CNS (such as natalizumab which targets the CD40L molecule) (Polman et al., 2006).",

Additionally, activated B cells can act as antigen-specific APCs for T cells and produce costimulatory molecules that influence the differentiation of T cells into Th1 or Th2 cells (Zouali, 2008). Patients with MS have increased B-cell numbers in the CNS, mainly memory cells and short-lived plasmablasts (Cepok et al., 2005). Plasmablasts persist in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) throughout the course of MS, and the numbers of these cells correlate with intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis (oligoclonal antibodies, one of the hallmarks of MS diagnosis) and with active inflammatory disease (Cepok et al., 2005; Owens et al., 2006). Moreover, B cells, plasma cells, autoantibodies, and complement have been detected in MS lesions (Prineas and Graham, 1981; Archelos et al., 2000), indicating their implication in demyelination. Additional indications for antibody-mediated mechanisms in MS come from the presence of ectopic lymphoid follicles in the CNS of patients with MS (Cepok et al., 2005; Serafini et al., 2004; Krumbholz et al., 2006; Magliozzi et al., 2007), especially those with progressive disease. It appears, therefore, that as the disease evolves into the progressive stage, the inflammation becomes compartmentalized and predominantly mediated by B cells. Additional findings that may explain progression of MS and its correlation with \u2018slow\u2019 in situ inflammation come from reports showing significant meningeal, cortical, and deep gray matter inflammatory lesions predominant in progressive MS or in patients with advanced disability and represent a bad prognostic factor (Serafini et al., 2004; Magliozzi et al., 2007; Ruggieri et al., 2015; Haider et al., 2014; Cappellani et al., 2014; Daams et al., 2013; Calabrese et al., 2011; Ceccarelli et al., 2010; Neema et al., 2009; Geurts et al., 2005; Popescu and Lucchinetti, 2012; Popescu et al., 2013; Lucchinetti et al., 2011; Kutzelnigg and Lassmann, 2006; Romme Christensen et al., 2013).",

The myelin sheath is interrupted at regular intervals by the nodes of Ranvier, where the axon is denuded. Because the axon has a high resistance to the electrical impulse, which makes the speed of conduction too slow, an alternative mechanism takes over. It is called \u2018saltatory conduction,\u2019 in which the electrical impulse jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next while achieving the required conduction velocity. However, if the distance between the available nodes is too great because of destruction of some myelin segments, the impulse cannot bridge the gap, and saltatory conduction is no longer possible. The electrical impulse must then travel via the slow axonal route (Figure 3b\n). Once the axon itself is destroyed, conduction is obviously no longer possible and the deficit, if any, becomes permanent. In some MS patients, signs or symptoms appear because nerve conduction slows when body temperature is elevated as a result of either ambient heat or fever. The latter is a common cause of pseudo-exacerbations. A body temperature increase of as little as 1 \u00b0C may be sufficient to cause such signs and symptoms, which disappear upon cooling. In the past, this was used diagnostically by means of the hot bath test.",

The disease is almost twice as common in women as in men, and the clinical onset is most frequent in the third and fourth decades. Certain neurological complaints in a person under the age of 40 are tantamount to making the diagnosis of MS: a Lhermitte symptom (tingling going down the back when flexing the neck), trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasms, unilateral intention tremor, or binocular diplopia. Similarly, certain abnormalities of the neurological examination of a young person are also common enough in MS to be of diagnostic value: temporal pallor of the optic disk, unilateral hyperreflexia and a Babinski sign, a significant decrease in position and/or vibratory sensation at the ankles, or some dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. MS patients may also experience rarer symptoms such as headaches, positional vertigo, seizures, back and neck pain, and significant cognitive decline. The latter was thought to be very rare since the disease does not affect the gray matter. However, it is now well documented that there is significant involvement of the gray matter in MS, and cognitive impairment is frequent even at the early stages of the disease (DeLuca et al., 2015; Langdon, 2011; Chiaravalloti and DeLuca, 2008; Cardoso et al., 2015) but often overseen/underdiagnosed.

A wide range of other measures is used to assess MS disability. In many cases, these are simple questionnaires, such as the MS Quality of Life and the fatigue scale questionnaires.",

These include the initial events of demyelination defined as clinically or radiologically isolated syndromes (CIS and RIS, respectively) (Okuda et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2005a, Miller et al., 2005b), ADEM (Brinar and Habek, 2010; Menge et al., 2007) and its variants (acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis \u2013 AHL, Marburg variant, and Balo's (Brinar and Habek, 2010) concentric sclerosis) (Zettl et al., 2012; Kuperan et al., 2003; Mader et al., 2004; Susac and Daroff, 2005), Schilder's sclerosis (Zettl et al., 2012) and transverse myelitis (Poser et al., 1986), neuromyelitis optica (NMO and NMO spectrum of diseases) (Wingerchuk and Weinshenker, 2013), recurrent isolated optic neuritis (Zettl et al., 2012), and tumefactive demyelination (Lucchinetti et al., 2008) (a large, tumor-like demyelinating lesion with surrounding edema) (Table 2). The differentiation between them is not only a terminological matter but has important implications on their management. For instance, patients with type-II MS immunopathogenesis (according to Luccinetti's classification (Lucchinetti et al., 2000), where autoantibodies seem to be more involved than T cells, or with the neuromyelitic variants of demyelination (NMO spectrum of diseases, associated with anti-aquaporin antibodies) (Wingerchuk and Weinshenker, 2013; Wingerchuk et al., 2006, 2007; Wingerchuk, 2010; McKay et al., 2006), may not only not respond well but also even deteriorate under some of the first-line treatments for MS (such as IFNs) (Bomprezzi et al., 2011). The unique clinical and neuroradiological features (Table 2), along with the use of immunological biomarkers (such as anti-AQP4 antibodies), help to distinguish these cases from classical MS. The use of such immunological and imaging biomarkers will not only improve the accuracy of diagnosis but also contribute to the identification of the patients with CIS or RIS, who are at greater risk for disability progression (worse prognosis) or, on the contrary, will have a more benign course.",

The crucial request in both criteria, in order to definitely diagnose MS, was the need for clinical (or laboratory) evidence of dissemination in time and space (DIT/DIS), that is, the presence of symptoms affecting more than one discrete CNS region and at more than one time point during the course of the disease. Patients were accordingly subclassified as clinically definite (CDMS) or probable and laboratory-supported definite or probable MS (Table 3).",

Similar to the Poser criteria, the 2001 McDonald diagnostic criteria require two clinical attacks varying in time and space to establish a definite diagnosis of MS. DIT could be fulfilled by either gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion, or a new T2 lesion detected on repeat MRI scanning performed 3 or more months after the baseline study. DIT required either meeting the Barkhof/Tintore MRI criteria (3 of the 4 criteria: \u22651 Gd-enhancing or 9 T2 lesions, \u22651 juxtacortical, \u22651 infratentorial, and \u22653 periventricular lesions) (Barkhof et al., 1997; Tintore et al., 2003) or the presence of two silent T2-weighted brain lesions and OCBs in the CSF. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2001 McDonald criteria for prediction of conversion to MS in 1\u20133 years were high and could therefore establish the diagnosis of MS after CIS earlier than the Poser criteria, more than doubling the rate of MS diagnosis within the first year of disease (Tintore et al., 2003; Dalton et al., 2002). The revised 2005 criteria better underlined the significance of spinal cord lesions for DIS criteria and allowed new T2-weighted lesions on brain MRI after 30 days (rather than the previous time frame of 3 months) following the baseline MRI to establish DIT (Polman et al., 2005). These updated criteria led to an improvement in sensitivity compared with the 2001 criteria (60% vs 47%), while retaining good specificity (88% vs 91%) (Swanton et al., 2007).",

To meet the criteria for DIS, a patient must have two clinical attacks in different CNS sites or one clinical attack accompanied by fulfillment of Swanton's radiographic criteria. Symptomatic MRI lesions in the brain stem or spinal cord are excluded from the lesion count for these MRI criteria. Gd enhancement is not necessary for DIS. According to the 2010 criteria, DIT requires a new T2- or Gd-enhancing lesion on subsequent MRI (regardless of timing from baseline scan) or the presence of both asymptomatic Gd-enhancing lesions and nonenhancing lesions on the baseline MRI (Table 3). Thus, the diagnosis of MS after one clinical attack may now be established even based solely on the baseline MRI (if both enhancing and nonenhancing lesions coexist). CSF findings do not replace the radiographic requirements for DIS according to the McDonald 2010 criteria. These revised criteria are considered to have increased diagnostic sensitivity without compromising specificity.",

Reasons for this poor association include the emphasis of MRI protocols only on the detection of focal white matter pathology, the limited sensitivity of the EDSS score to detect small degrees of clinical deterioration, and the inability of the routine MRI techniques to provide an accurate estimation of degeneration, axonal damage, and compartmentalized inflammation (i.e., in the meninges or in the cortical and deep gray matter) (Ruggieri et al., 2015; Haider et al., 2014; Cappellani et al., 2014; Daams et al., 2013; Calabrese et al., 2011; Neema et al., 2009; Magliozzi et al., 2007; Ceccarelli et al., 2010; Geurts et al., 2005; Popescu and Lucchinetti, 2012; Popescu et al., 2013; Kutzelnigg and Lassmann, 2006; Serafini et al., 2004; Lucchinetti et al., 2011; Romme Christensen et al., 2013). T1 hypointense lesions (\u2018black holes\u2019) seem to correlate better with measures of disability than T2 lesion number and volumes (Venken et al., 2010). Contrast-enhancing lesions indicate acute inflammation; such enhancement is transient, typically lasting about 6\u20138 weeks(Venken et al., 2010; Lucchinetti et al., 2000).",

            "text": "About 60\u201370% of patients with CIS and up to 90% of those with MS have two or more immunoglobulin G (IgG) oligoclonal bands (OCBs) uniquely to the CSF (Miller et al., 2005b; Avasarala et al., 2001; Awad et al., 2010; Paolino et al., 1996; Polman et al., 2008; Sastre-Garriga et al., 2003; Tintore et al., 2001; Zipoli et al., 2009). CSF OCB testing must be run in parallel with sampling of serum obtained within 72 h of the lumbar puncture. The preferred method of analysis with the highest sensitivity and specificity for MS is isoelectric focusing on agarose gels, followed by immunodetection by blotting or fixation (Freedman et al., 2005). Some 70\u201390% of MS patients will have an elevated IgG index (Awad et al., 2010) and (Link and Huang, 2006), and this may be in conjunction with, or independent of, the presence of OCB in the CSF. The presence of \u22652 OCBs in the CSF has a positive predictive value of 97%, a negative predictive value of 84%, a sensitivity of 91%, and a specificity of 94% for developing relapsing\u2013remitting MS (RRMS) after a CIS (Masjuan et al., 2006). The presence of OCBs within 3 months of CIS (Tintore et al., 2008) nearly doubles the risk of a second clinical attack over 4\u20136 years (Martino et al., 2005). On the other hand, CSF with >50 white blood cells (WBCs) mm\u22123 or >100 mg dl\u22121 protein is rarely observed in MS, and this should raise the possibility of an alternative diagnosis (McDonald et al., 2001; Trapp and Nave, 2008). It is also important to bear in mind that disorders other than MS may also be associated with the presence of OCB and a high IgG index. The differential diagnosis for the presence of OCBs in the CSF includes the Sjogren's syndrome (75\u201390% of patients with neurological involvement), neurosarcoidosis (40\u201370%), systemic lupus erythematosus (30\u201350%), Behcet disease (20\u201350%), paraneoplastic disorders (5\u201325%), antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody syndromes (40\u201370%), Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada syndrome (30\u201360%), Hashimoto's steroid-responsive encephalopathy (25\u201335%), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (100%), rubella encephalitis (100%), neurosyphilis (90\u201395%), neuroborreliosis (80\u201390%), human immunodeficiency virus infection (60\u201380%), meningitis (5\u201350%), adrenoleukodystrophy (100%), ataxia telangiectasia (50\u201360%), Leber hereditary optic atrophy (5\u201315%), CNS vascular disorders (5\u201325%), and CNS tumors (<5%) (Awad et al., 2010).",

The use of neuroimaging (MRI) techniques that allow the detection of silent inflammatory activity and neurodegeneration has provided an important tool for the substantiation of the clinical efficacy of treatments and the early diagnosis of MS. The introduction of new diagnostic criteria (McDonald et al., 2001) for CDMS does not necessitate \u2013 as in the past years \u2013 the occurrence of a second clinical relapse, but only the dissemination in time and space, reflected by MRI dynamic changes. This has paved the path to the concept of early immunotherapy in selected patients experiencing the first demyelinating episode (CIS), or even (theoretically) in individuals with a sole neuroradiological evidence of demyelination (RIS). However, the prognosis of MS is highly variable and therefore additional clinical, radiological, and immunological surrogate biomarkers should be used to define those cases with a bad prognosis in which early immunotherapy at the stage of CIS or RIS may be justified.",

Oral administration of high-dose methylprednisolone appears to be equally efficient to intravenous administration (Alam et al., 1993; Sellebjerg et al., 1998; Martinelli et al., 2009). There are indications, not based on published studies in MS but on experience in other autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus \u2013 SLE), that abrupt discontinuation of intravenous steroidal treatment in MS relapses may increase the risk of a recurrence of the symptoms. Therefore, a tapering-off protocol following high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone appears preferable.",

            "text": "Glatiramer acetate (GA; COP-1, Copaxone, Teva, Israel) is a synthetic co-polymer, composed of alanine; glutamine; lysine; and tyrosine, with some immunological similarities to the MBP molecule (and other myelin antigens), without itself being encephalitogenic. GA is presumed to block the MHC/TCR complex and to downregulate the antigen presentation to T cells (competitive inhibition) and/or induce regulatory cells (Racke et al., 2010). In a pilot controlled study (Bornstein et al., 1987), in 50 patients with RRMS, a great reduction in the number of relapses in the GA-treated group was reported. A later and larger pivotal, double-blind, trial (Johnson et al., 1995) showed that GA induced a 29% reduction in relapse rate, but without affecting the progression of disability at 2 years. MRI monitoring, performed in one of the centers, showed only marginal inhibition of the MRI activity. Adverse effects were usually mild, including mainly localized, injection-site reactions and a systemic reaction occurring within moments of GA administration (associated with chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea) in 15% of the patients. In a separate randomized study treatment with GA led to a significant (10%) reduction in the total number of enhancing lesions compared with placebo (Comi et al., 2001); 57% of the patients treated for up to 22 years with GA maintained improved or unchanged EDSS scores and low annualized relapse rates (Miller et al., 2008; Karussis et al., 2010a). GA was also shown to reduce the risk of CIS patients to develop CDMS by 45% (Comi et al., 2009). A trial with GA in PPMS was terminated after an interim analysis that indicated no discernible treatment effect on primary outcome (Wolinsky et al., 2007; Sajja et al., 2008). An oral preparation of GA was shown ineffective evaluated in a later large trial including Filippi et al. (2006).",

It is also justified by the acknowledged complexity of MS immunopathogenesis, which may necessitate the use of more than one drug to interfere with the various distinct immune elements involved at multiple levels of the immune axis, in order to maximize treatment efficacy (Figure 3a). However, owing to the complex interactions and the delicate balance between the various immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks, unexpected or paradoxical effects may occur when different drugs affecting the immune system are combined. Small-size open studies have provided some positive indications supporting the principle of combination treatments such as methotrexate or azathioprine plus IFN\u03b2 (Calabresi et al., 2002; Pulicken et al., 2005). However, other larger controlled studies using IFN as basic therapy and methotrexate, steroids, or azathioprine as add-ons were negative (showing only some trends) (Havrdova et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2009; Ravnborg et al., 2010), with the exception of one (Sorensen et al., 2009) which showed a benefit of combination of IFN with steroids. The combination of natalizumab with IFN\u03b2 showed some additional benefits in reduction of the relapse rate, but this trial was terminated because of two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the natalizumab\u2013Avonex combination group (Goodman et al., 2009a). Addition of GA to natalizumab improved the neuroradilogical endpoints in this trial, but there was no additional benefit in terms of relapses and EDSS changes (Goodman et al., 200a).",

Monthly infusions of this antibody showed strong efficacy against placebo, reducing the relapse rate at 1 year by 68% and the chance of acquiring fixed disability over 2 years by 42% (Polman et al., 2006). Moreover, natalizumab-treated patients were free of any disease activity (relapses, progression of disability, and new MRI activity) by around 30%. Although this efficacy appears higher than that observed in the IFN and GA pivotal studies, such cross comparison between different studies (of different design and MS patients populations) is not scientifically sound. US and European authorities licensed natalizumab for relapsing MS, but the drug was later withdrawn from the market when two cases of PML (progressive multifocal leucoencephalitis, an almost universally, lethal infection) were identified in a trial combining Avonex (IFN\u03b2-1a) with natalizumab (Rudick et al., 2006). As a result, natalizumab is now licensed as monotherapy only for severe RRMS, or as second-line immunotherapy for MS. Since licensing, many (more than 300) additional cases of PML have been identified, almost exclusively among the patients treated for more than 2 years with natalizumab. Three parameters have been identified as being related to an increased risk of PML: (1) duration of treatment; (2) previous exposure to cytotoxic medications; and (3) the presence of anti-JC (John Cunningham) virus antibodies (which are found in half of the MS patients and indicate previous exposure to the virus) (Sorensen et al., 2012). All reported cases of PML following natalizumab treatment were positive for the JC virus antibodies. Introduction of the test for these antibodies has helped in the selection of patients to be treated with natalizumab and those in whom the treatment should be discontinued due to a high risk (i.e., more than 1:1000 and in cases with all the above three risk factors, more than 1:100) of PML.",

Since the introduction of IFN\u03b2, huge steps have been made and increasingly more specific and efficacious (Figure 4) modalities have been introduced and registered. However, along with the seemingly increasing efficacy of the newly introduced and more targeted immunotherapies, more safety issues have arisen. The cumulative experience obtained from the numerous clinical trials in MS with various types of immunotherapies allows one to draw the conclusion that inflammation, most probably initiated in the peripheral immune system, is crucial for the formation of new demyelinating lesions and, with time, appears to be the main cause for the resulting axonal damage and neuronal tissue atrophy. Immunological therapies, ideally applied as early as possible, might prevent progression of disability if given before the cascade of events that lead to irreversible tissue loss. The reported lower efficacy of most of the known immunotherapies in patients with progressive forms of MS might be explained by the possibility that inflammation is less pronounced or only compartmentalized in the CNS at these stages of the disease. More effective modalities that exert strong local immunomodulation in the CNS might be more beneficial for progressive MS. The additional goals of future MS therapy should include neuroprotective modalities and techniques that may enhance neuroregeneration and remyelination. High expectations of this direction are focused on stem cell-related treatments, but these have to be substantiated in future controlled trials.",
