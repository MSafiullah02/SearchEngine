Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we present a severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal chest X-ray images. Such a tool can gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections (and pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU. Images from a public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively by three blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large (non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19 images which are predictive for our task. This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the outputs from an this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE.

Chest X-rays (CXRs) provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease [Yoon et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020] . As early as March 2020, Chinese hospitals used artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted computed tomography (CT) imaging analysis to screen COVID-19 cases and streamline diagnosis [Jin et al., 2020] . Many teams have since launched AI initiatives to improve triaging of COVID-19 patients (i.e., discharge, general admission or ICU care) and allocation of hospital resources (i.e., direct non-invasive ventilation to invasive ventilation) [Strickland, 2020] . While these recent tools exploit clinical data, practically deployable CXR-based predictive models remain lacking.",

The mean absolute error (MAE) is useful to understand the error in units of the scores that are predicted while the mean squared error (MSE) helps to rank the different methods based on their furthest outliers. One possible reason that fewer features work best is that having fewer parameters prevents overfitting. Some features could serve as proxy variables to confounding attributes such as sex or age and preventing these features from being used prevents the distraction from hurting generalization performance. Hand selecting feature subsets which are intuitively related to this task imparts domain knowledge as a bias on the model which improves performance. Thus, the top performing model (using the single \"lung opacity\" output as a feature) is used for the subsequent qualitative analysis.",
