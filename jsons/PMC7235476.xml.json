A novel coronavirus was identified as the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) and the disease was named as COVID\u201019 (ie coronavirus disease 2019).\n1\n By February 2020, COVID\u201019 has spread throughout China and across the world. As of March 11, 2020, the first case of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection has been confirmed in Turkey. Recent reports demonstrate that the COVID\u201019 pandemic is set for exponential growth in Turkey. The Turkish government imposed a partial curfew for citizens over the age of 65 and those with chronic diseases, on March 21, 2020. The government had also banned flights with suspicious countries, closed schools, cafes and bars, mass prayers, and indefinitely postponed matches in its main sports leagues. However, outpatient clinics did not completely halt the services to some patients who need to visit during the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak. As reported before, dermatology practices may be a vector for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 transmission.\n2\n In this study, we summarized our patients profile and possible risk factors for transmission.",

Similar to their suggestion, only 19% of patients need emergent dermatologic intervention, or dose adjustment for their immunosuppresant drugs, biologic agents, systemic treatment. The vast majority of our patients were young, and they might be asymptomatic carriers who could shed viral particles in their prolonged incubation period. Emerging research also suggests that COVID\u201019 viral particles remain viable in droplets for several hours and can survive several days on multiple surfaces.\n3\n Therefore, we cannot predict their risk for transmission. By the way, 40 of patients were over age 65, they were at high risk and severe illness for infection. It was observed that the patients being age 65 and older did not pay attention to the outbreak of COVID\u201019. After the partial curfew, they did not come to outpatient clinics.",

In addition, acne is a well\u2010known stress responsive condition and has known psychological percussion in the causation and in the course of the disease.5, 6 This may be clarified with their anxiety that their symptoms will get worse if they do not visit their physician and take their treatment immediately. These patients frequently consider that they will not have COVID\u201019 infection due to their young age, even though they are exposed to viral particles of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Hu et al showed that 29% asymptomatic COVID\u201019 cases showed normal computer tomography (CT) image and had no symptoms during hospitalization; therefore, some of our patients might not have any symptoms, and as a result they were not screened for infection.\n7\n\n",
