Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum (OAC) has been proved as an easy, safe, and economically viable technique to help preterm neonates to build up their immunity. In this review, we assessed the effects of OAC on preterm infants. Several mainstream databases were searched including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and a website of clinical trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OAC vs. placebo or no intervention in preterm infants (gestation age <34 weeks or birth weight <1500 g) were eligible. Overall, nine RCTs (n = 689) were included in the review. Meta-analysis showed no statistical significance in terms of the incidence of NEC (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.33-1.06, p = 0.08), LOS (RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.60-1.03, p = 0.08) and mortality rate (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.38-1.05, p = 0.07). No significant difference was found in the subgroup analysis, apart from the group of the undeveloped region in NEC and mortality. In addition, time was significantly reduced in terms of achieving full enteral feeding (MD = \u22123.60, 95% CI = \u22126.55-0.64, p = 0.02) and hospital stay (MD = \u221210.38, 95% CI = \u221218.47-2.29, p = 0.01). The results show that OAC does not reduce the incidences of NEC, LOS, and death in preterm infants, but there is a trend toward a positive effect. It is therefore recommended as routine care for preterm infants in the NICU.",

However necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a kind of intestinal excessive inflammation, still remains a major contributor to mortality rates as high as 20-30% and has been confirmed as a multi-factor disease [1, 2] . Immature intestinal development, abnormal bacterial colonization, inappropriate feeding, and inflammatory cascades are all responsible for triggering of NEC [3, 4] . The disease has a blurry onset and a rapid progression making it undetectable in the early stages. Starting with feeding intolerance or abdominal distention, it will gradually evolve into catastrophic complications such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death [4] .",

Similarly, four studies [18, 33, 35, 36] were also of high ROB in blinding of the outcome assessment, with two studies [23, 37] of unclear risk.

            "text": "The key results of previous studies in this field need to be discussed. Some studies found that colostrum was effective in reducing the rate of NEC, revealing its effect in building up immunity [11, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Term babies could suck their mothers' nipples to obtain breast milk and their immunity would be triggered through the first bite with colostrum being served as stimulator [43, 44] . However, preterm infants who have undeveloped digestive systems are deprived of this natural process because they have to be breastfed via a nasogastric tube that bypasses their oropharynx. Some researchers found that the oral cavities of ill babies are easily colonized by pathogens after being administrated into the NICU and the use of oral rinses such as chlorhexidine, could bring unpleasant adverse effects [45, 46] . Thus, oral priming with colostrum is a better way to help preterm infants to strengthen their immunity, thereby preventing infections.",

The duration of hospital stay reflects the condition of preterm infants and the related medical costs, and the pooled results indicate that OAC would shorten the time to achieve these two goals. Some other clinical or biochemical outcomes in these RCT studies still need to be discussed. Abd-Elgawad et al. have reported lower growth rates of Klebsiella species in the oropharyngeal pouch, a lower incidence of ventilatorassociated pneumonia, a shorter duration of oxygen therapy and, fewer episodes of feeding intolerance after OAC treatment [22] . In another study, Zhang et al. have reported that OAC could raise the level of lactoferrin in saliva after 7 days and 21 days, while Glass et al. have also found increased sIgA levels of saliva at day 7 [18, 23] . Sohn et al. have reported changes in the oral microbiota colonization in the OAC group [36] , while Lee et al. report a decreased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increased level of immune-protective factors compared with the control group [34] .

Third, the incidences of NEC, LOS, and death were not the primary outcomes in some studies. Some data related to the secondary outcomes were inadequate, with strong heterogeneity. Thus, the pooled results of the secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution. In view of these limitations, larger, well-designed RCTs are needed, since some included RCT studies had a high ROB and did not contain their predesigned study protocols. Up to now, preterm birth is still the major cause of multiple life-threatening diseases, and the economic costs are high. Although a significant improvement in the clinically important outcomes was not observed in the OAC group, OAC can still have positive effects on preterm infants.
