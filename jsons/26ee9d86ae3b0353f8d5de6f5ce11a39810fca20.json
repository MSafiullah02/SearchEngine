            "text": "In patients with hematologic malignancies, severe lung infections frequently lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial infections predominate (see Table 42 .1) and arise because of severe immune suppression inherent to these disorders and their treatments. The pathology of ARDS involves severe alveolar epithelial cell damage, hyaline membrane formation, and festinate myofibroblast proliferation and fibrosis in the intra-alveolar spaces. Affected HSCT recipients who deteriorate and require intubation and mechanical ventilation for ARDS experience a high mortality. In one series, overall intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 74% [3] . In recent years, advancements in supportive care have resulted in significant improvement in survival [4] . However, longterm survivors continue to have residual lung dysfunction that may progress over time. In one series, autopsy evaluation revealed pulmonary fibrosis in 55% of such patients, underscoring the importance of dysregulated reparative mechanisms in the lung after an acute insult [5] . Factors influencing progression to the fibro-proliferative phase of ARDS versus resolution and reconstitution of the normal parenchymal architecture are poorly understood. Abnormal repair and remodeling may be profoundly affected by both environmental and genetic factors. In this context, mechanical ventilation may affect the macromolecules that constitute the extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin, fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycans) and impact the biomechanical balance within the lung parenchyma. Fungal infections also may follow a chronic course of prolonged inflammation with focal or diffuse scarring ultimately resulting in significant pulmonary dysfunction. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) occurs frequently in hematologic malignancy patients, particularly after an allogeneic HSCT, presenting classically as angio-invasive or airway-invasive disease. Angioinvasive IA is characterized histologically by invasion and occlusion of small to medium-sized pulmonary arteries by fungal hyphae. This effect leads to the formation of necrotic hemorrhagic nodules or pleuralbased, wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarcts. The \"halo sign\" (nodules surrounded by areas of ground-glass attenuation) on chest CT scan strongly suggests a diagnosis of IA [6] .",

Positive yield from respiratory samples such as sputa examination or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) is more likely in this subtype of IA than in the angio-invasive variety. Clinical manifestations of acute airway-invasive aspergillosis include: acute tracheobronchitis, exudative bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. Using high-resolution CT, the associated bronchiolitis is characterized by the presence of peri-bronchial consolidation, centri-lobular micro-nodules, and branching linear or nodular areas of ground-glass attenuation having a \"tree-in-bud\" appearance [7] . This form of airway-invasive aspergillosis can be associated with pseudo-membranous necrotizing tracheal involvement that can cause pneumo-mediastinum and has a high [8] . Airway-invasive aspergillosis can also follow a chronic course known as chronic necrotizing aspergillosis.

            "text": "Radiation-induced lung injury first was described in 1898, soon after the development of roentgenograms [10] . In 1925 the distinction between two separate types of radiation-induced lung injury, radiation pneumonitis and radiation fibrosis, was made [11] . An entire chapter from Drs. Gallego and Rello in this book is dedicated to radiation-related lung injury. Radiation-induced lung injury results from the combination of direct cytotoxicity upon normal lung tissue and, perhaps more importantly, the development of fibrosis triggered by radiation-induced cellular signal transduction. The cytotoxic effect is largely a consequence of DNA damage and death in normal lung epithelial cells. The development of fibrosis that can compromise lung function is mediated by a number of different cytokines. Clinically, the most extensively studied radiation-induced cytokine is transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b), which can induce fibroblast collagen deposition. A normal plasma TGF-b concentration at the conclusion of a clinical course of radiotherapy has been observed to be a predictor for the risk of pneumonitis [12] . Other proinflammatory cytokines, including, but not limited to, interleukin IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNFa and IL-1, are upregulated immediately after irradiation. Increased IL-6 plasma concentrations correlate with an increased risk of radiation-induced lung injury [13, 14] . Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are upregulated in animal models of lung irradiation injury and antedate the development of fibrosis [15] . Factors affecting the development of radiation-induced lung disease are numerous and are included in Table 42 .2 [16] [17] [18] [19] ; all have been reported to raise the risk of radiation pneumonitis. Radiographic and bronchoscopic findings are nonspecific, and the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DL) typically is depressed in patients with radiation-induced lung damage. Long-term glucocorticoids may be effective in the treatment of radiationassociated lung injury in which COP is the leading pulmonary involvement; however, symptoms and radiographic abnormalities, as well as immunologically mediated lymphocytic alveolitis frequently recur with discontinuation of therapy [20, 21] . Early studies suggested that pentoxifylline may have a role \u2022\u2022 Method of irradiation such as conformal radiation therapy or specialized techniques including intensity-modulated radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy [16] [17] [18] [19] in the treatment of radiation-induced fibrosis involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues as this agent also inhibits experimental bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats, likely via its anti-TNFa effects [22] . Pentoxifylline showed a significant protective effect for both early and late lung radiotoxicity. Amifostine is a pro-drug that is de-phosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase in tissues to a pharmacologically active free thiol metabolite. This drug can reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy by acting as a scavenger of free radicals generated in tissues exposed to radiation. Early evidence suggests that amifostine may decrease radiation-induced pulmonary injury without diminishing the therapeutic effect [23, 24] . Captopril and other ACE inhibitors also have been shown to reduce radiation-induced lung fibrosis in rats [25] , but there are no published data in humans. Improvements in the perfusion and ventilation of radiation-injured lung tissue may be expected from 3 to 18 months after radiation therapy. Beyond 18 months, however, further significant improvement appears unusual [26, 27] .",

The increased complexity of multi-modality treatments and high-dose protocols designed to augment antineoplastic efficacy, particularly in the context of HSCT, has increased the incidence of pulmonary complications. The diagnosis of drug-induced respiratory disease often is complex because: (1)1 patients may be exposed to several pneumo-toxic drugs concurrently or in sequence due to earlier treatment failure; (2)2 time to onset of pulmonary toxicity may be delayed, making it difficult to ascertain which agent is responsible for the pulmonary reaction; (3)3 the combination of drugs to treat malignant hematologic conditions may lead to unexpected drug interactions, producing enhanced toxicity compared with the toxicity of each agent considered separately; and (4)4 radiation therapy to the chest or TBI. Other factors that play a role in the development of pulmonary toxicity include advanced age, current smoking, abrupt withdrawal of corticosteroids and the use of HSCT (allogeneic vs autologous). Changes in blood neutrophil counts, thrombocytopenia, coagulation deficits, volume overload or left ventricular dysfunction also can influence the spectrum and severity of pulmonary drug toxicity. In addition to overt pulmonary toxicity, subclinical drug-induced lung dysfunction often occurs in the form of reduced DLCO and lung volumes or changes in cell populations in BAL fluid. Upon cessation of exposure to the agent, most of these changes reverse slowly in a few weeks or months.",

            "text": "Drug-induced lung injury can manifest in several patterns ( the majority of  cases) , azathioprine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine and, rarely, vinca alkaloids. The onset of this condition is unpredictable; symptoms may develop a few days to years after exposure. The clinical picture includes increasing dyspnea, dry cough, high fevers and rash. The severity of illness can vary from mild to progressive respiratory failure, and associated radiographic findings may range from bilateral (usually symmetrical) interstitial or alveolar opacities to extensive consolidation with air bronchograms and volume loss [30] [31] [32] . Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph node enlargement have been reported in patients with methotrexate-induced lung injury [33, 34] . BAL fluid usually shows lymphocyte predominance. A low ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes is suggestive, but not specific, for drug-induced lung disease. Other BAL findings include neutrophilia or a combined pattern of lymphocytosis with neutrophilia or eosinophilia [35] . Appropriate stains, cultures and molecular techniques in BAL fluid should be performed to exclude opportunistic infections. A lung biopsy may be required in selected cases. Histopathologic features include interstitial inflammation and pulmonary granulomas. Fibrosis can be present, but is generally not the dominant histopathologic feature. Alveolar edema or hemorrhage may be found as a manifestation of severe methotrexate pneumonitis [34] . High-dose corticosteroids may be indicated with more advanced disease, as drug-induced NSIP can lead to mortality if it is not treated promptly, but in milder cases, symptoms can subside after simple drug withdrawal [36] . Although rechallenge with the drug may be safe, it is not generally recommended [37] . Eosinophilic pneumonia (EP) is an unusual and unpredictable pattern of response to chemotherapeutic agents as opposed to that described following the use of some antibiotics. EP in patients with hematologic malignancies can result from treatment with fludarabine and, rarely, interferons, inhaled or parenteral pentamidine, and radiographic contrast media [33] . Although methotrexate and procarbazine pneumonitis can often be associated with peripheral eosinophilia, BAL and histopathologic features are not those of EPs. Typically, the syndrome of EP develops during or shortly after termination of treatment. A history of an allergic disorder, or repeated courses of treatment with the specific drug, may predict for a higher risk.",

Single chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., BCNU or other nitrosoureas, bleomycin, busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, procarbazine, vinblastine) or multiagent cytostatic chemotherapy have been reported to cause this lung toxicity [50] . Some regimens may be associated with a greater likelihood of DAD than others even if they differ in one agent only. For instance, in patients with de novo-treated Hodgkin's lymphoma, the substitution of gemcitabine for dacarbazine, e.g., ABVG rather than ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and gemcitabine instead of dacarbazine), was associated with a 42% incidence rate of pulmonary toxicity [51] . Likewise, the substitution of gemcitabine for etoposide in the dose-escalated BEACOPP regimen (bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone and gemcitabine rather than etoposide) significantly escalated the likelihood of pulmonary toxicity [52] [53] [54] . Concurrent administration of radiation therapy to the chest or use of TBI, supplemental oxygen and possibly colonystimulating factors (CSFs) may increase the risk of DAD.",

A clinical pearl from Dr. Bergeron in this book also very nicely describes this type of pulmonary involvement. Noninfectious conditions now represent the major pulmonary causes of morbidity and mortality after HSCT. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), discussed in another chapter in this book, remains one of the more common and serious pulmonary complications occurring within months after HSCT. Although graft-versus-host reactions may play an etiologic role, the major contributing factor is conditioning-related toxicity. Among lung conditions that are more closely associated with GVHD, both bronchiolitis obliterans (BrOb) (onset months to years after HSCT) and bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (COP) may lead to FA. The term COP should not be used interchangeably with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) to describe a patient with chronic lung dysfunction after HSCT, although such usage unfortunately is widespread. The two disorders differ with respect to histopathology, pulmonary function characteristics and, most importantly, response to therapy. BrOb is an inexorably progressive condition, whereas COP behaves similarly to idiopathic COP seen in other populations. COP after HSCT usually is quite responsive to corticosteroids and in other settings may resolve spontaneously, whereas BrOb is not [75, 76] . Organizing pneumonia also is associated with restrictive (rather than obstructive) changes on pulmonary function testing (Table 42 .4).",

In the skin, liver and intestine, GVHD produces a characteristic T-lymphocyte-mediated epithelial destruction. There are few data to support such a defined lesion with the exception of lymphocytic pneumonitis [77] . A variety of pulmonary complications have been described as manifestations of GVHD, but these associations are based primarily on the simultaneous occurrence of pulmonary abnormalities, the absence of an infectious agent and nonspecific histopathologic lesions in the setting of established GVHD in other organs. Nevertheless, both acute and late-onset lung injury syndromes have shown a clinical association with GVHD, including IPS, engraftment syndrome, diffuses alveolar hemorrhage, BrOb and COP [78] .

These entities are manifested on pulmonary function testing by a diminished FEV1 or FEV1/FVC. The incidence of these syndromes ranges from 6% to 32%, depending upon the definition of AFO applied in each study [79, 80] . Typically, the presentation occurs beyond the third month after HSCT [81] . Among patients who develop chronic GVHD, new-onset AFO may develop in up to one third of the patients. In a study of 11 cases the underlying process accounting for AFO was BrOb in 70% [82] . Histologically, this process demonstrates fibrous obliteration of the lumen of respiratory and membranous bronchioles. In the absence of histopathologic evidence, new onset AFO after allogeneic HSCT often is referred to as \"bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome\" (BOS). In addition to chronic GVHD, risk factors for the development of AFO include increasing recipient age, pre-transplant reduction in the ratio FEV1/FVC, low serum immunoglobulin levels, use of methotrexate and a history of respiratory viral infection within the first 100 days [79] . The onset typically is insidious with presenting symptoms including dry cough (60-100%), dyspnea (50-70%) and wheezing (40%), but fever is uncommon [79, 82, 83] . The chest radiograph is usually normal, but high-resolution CT scans often demonstrate evidence of expiratory air trapping, hypo-attenuation and bronchial dilation [80, [84] [85] [86] . Demonstrating persistent AFO using pulmonary function testing and exclusion of other causes of AFO such as asthma, tobacco-related emphysema, and viral or bacterial respiratory infection establish the diagnosis. Except for its utility in excluding an infectious etiology, BAL is usually nonspecific [87] , and transbronchial biopsies typically are nondiagnostic due to the patchy nature of this small airway process and the limited size of samples obtained. Surgical lung biopsy is rarely indicated.",

In RLD, the ratio FEV 1 /FVC is maintained near 100% [90, 91] . RLD is common after HSCT. Significant decreases in FVC or TLC have been reported in as many as 25-45% of allogeneic HSCT recipients by day 100. A decline in TLC or FVC after HSCT (even if the absolute values for each measurement remained within the normal range) has been associated with an increase in nonrelapse mortality. TBI-containing conditioning regimens and the presence of acute GVHD have been associated with RLD, in addition to obstructive lung disease [92] [93] [94] ; however, the impact of age on the development of RLD is less clear. Early reports suggested that the incidence of RLD is lower in children compared to adults and that the incidence increases with advancing recipient age [95] . More recent studies have revealed significant RLD in children receiving HSCT [96] . Organizing pneumonia after HSCT falls under the RLD pattern on liver function tests and recently was shown to be associated with prior acute and chronic GVHD. Organizing pneumonia has been described in case reports as occurring after both allogeneic and syngeneic HSCT; these data suggest an association of the lung lesion with chronic GVHD and intestinal ulcerations. In addition, corticosteroid therapy appeared beneficial in the resolution of the lesion. In a recent case control study, Freudenberger et al. reviewed 49 cases of histologic COP [97] . The clinical features of COP in this population were similar to idiopathic and other etiologies with an association between acute and chronic GVHD and the subsequent development of COP. Affected patients were more likely to have skin involvement with acute GVHD and chronic GVHD affecting the gut and oral mucosa. The causes of COP following HSCT remain enigmatic, but possible etiologies include direct allo-immunologic reactions, atypical infection or atypical manifestations of IPS. Regardless, the clinical presentations and responses of COP are similar to other cases of idiopathic COP.",

            "text": "The immunologic mechanisms responsible for chronic, fibrotic pulmonary dysfunction after HSCT remain poorly defined, in large part because of the lack of correlative data obtained from afflicted HSCT recipients and the paucity of suitable SCT animal models for either RLD or OLD. Chronic pulmonary disease following allogeneic HSCT likely involves an initial insult to lung parenchyma followed by an ongoing inflammatory process involving the interplay between recruited donor-derived immune cells and the resident cells of the pulmonary vascular endothelium and interstitium. Mechanistic insights into OLD following HSCT have been derived from studies of lung allograft rejection. Data generated from both humans and mice support the hypothesis that the development of BrOb in this scenario involves the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, along with interactions between APCs and activated lymphocytes [104, 105] A tri-phasic model of chronic noninfectious lung injury after HSCT has been proposed [106] . In phase I, an acute pneumonitis develops as a consequence of an allogeneic immune response, resulting in the sequential influx of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils into an inflamed pulmonary parenchyma. In phase II, a persistent inflammatory signal, in the setting of dysregulated repair mechanisms, promotes the transition from acute to chronic injury. If the inciting injurious stimulus predominantly involves bronchiolar epithelial cells, phase II is associated with the concentric infiltration of lymphocytes and collagen deposition in the peri-bronchiolar areas resulting in the development of chronic bronchiolitis. If, however, the alveolar epithelium is the primary target, leukocyte recruitment and matrix deposition are confined primarily to the interstitial space. As chronic inflammation proceeds to phase III, lung fibroblasts increase dramatically in number and contribute to the enhanced deposition of collagen and granulation tissue in and around bronchial structures, ultimately resulting in complete obliteration of small airways and fixed OLD. By contrast, fibroblast proliferation and intra-septal collagen deposition during phase III ultimately result in interstitial thickening, septal fibrosis, significant volume loss and severe RLD.",

Evidence for a role of TNFa in the transition from acute to chronic lung injury comes from studies using targeted over-expression of TNFa in the lungs of rodents [110] . In these models, early lung histopathology includes a lymphocytic infiltrate similar to that seen in experimental IPS models [111, 112] , whereas the histologic changes associated with more prolonged exposure to TNFa show both interstitial and peribronchial inflammation that closely resemble changes seen at later time points after HSCT [107, 113] .",

Despite the high success rate in treating hematologic malignancies with or without using HSCT, this sequence of events continues to be a significant contributor to nonrelapse morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies because of either the disease itself or as a result of treatment modalities employed. The pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to the initiation and progression of disease remain poorly defined. To this end, current treatment options remain suboptimal and primarily limited to supportive care measures and antiinflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant therapy. Further research is necessary (in the form of clinical trials and pre-clinical models) to improve our understanding of fibrosing alveolits and related disorders and to ultimately design and implement targeted therapeutic strategies.",
