Sewage sludge, increasingly referred to as biosolids, is an inevitable product of wastewater treatment. Conventional wastewater treatment processes comprise separate process streams for the liquid and solid fractions (sludge). The overall aim of treatment (in terms of solids) is: (i) to reduce to the minimum the amount of solids in the treated effluent in order to achieve discharge standards; and (ii) maximize the level of solids in the sludge in order to minimize the volume requiring further treatment and disposal.",

The screenings are usually removed from the process stream and disposed of separately by landfilling or incineration. Occasionally, screenings may be shredded (comminuted) to reduce their size and returned to the process stream. This may cause problems with downstream processes and, as a consequence, is rarely practised at works which incorporate secondary (biological) treatment. The other component of preliminary treatment is grit removal, which is accomplished in chambers (or channels) or by centrifugation, taking advantage of the greater settling velocities of these solids. The material is largely inorganic in nature and is usually disposed of to landfill.",

There are several commonly used methods of sludge treatment, including long-term storage (in lagoons), lime stabilization, digestion (aerobic or anaerobic), air drying, thermal drying, and incineration or gasification (for energy recovery).

The figures for the EU are 5.1 M tds and 48% respectively (CEC, 1999). Within the EU amounts of sludge produced vary considerably, with Germany producing the largest amount of treated sludge followed by the UK and France (Fig. 17.2\n). The proportion of treated sludge used in agriculture varies across the European Union, with just over 10% of sludge production in Ireland being applied to land compared with 66% in France (Fig. 17.3\n). Factors affecting the amount of sludge applied to agricultural land include topography, land use, climatic conditions, and the availability of alternative means of disposal. In the UK, sludge production is increasing, principally as a result of the EU Directive on the treatment of urban wastewater (CEC, 1991). The cessation of sea disposal has resulted in a greater proportion of sludge being used in agriculture (Table 17.3\n), a trend which is projected to continue in the medium term (Fig. 17.4\n).",

They recognize that for certain crops the risk of disease transmission is unacceptable, i.e. salad items which have a short growing period and which are to be consumed raw. For other crops the combination of treatment and a suitable period of no harvesting will result in the numbers of pathogenic microorganisms being reduced below a minimum infective dose (MID). The concept of MID is important - it relates to the number of organisms which must be ingested to cause disease. It varies widely depending not only on the particular pathogen but also on the susceptibility of the host (Table 17.6\n). For example in the young, elderly, pregnant or those whose immunity is reduced the minimum number of organisms required to initiate disease is much smaller.",

Relatively few cells (2% of total) were transported away from the soil surface and into the deeper layers of the soil. Run-off following heavy rainfall resulted in a loss from the soil of 7% of the E. coli applied in the slurry. A recent ecological study on predation of E. coli O157 by Acanthamoeba polyphaga has shown that the bacterial cells are capable of surviving and even replicating within this common environmental protozoan (Barker et al., 1999). This may be important in the dissemination and survival of STEC within the environment.",

The most relevant data were reported by Mawdsley and colleagues (1996a) who studied the transport of Cryptosporidium oocysts through soil following the application of slurry to a poorly draining silt clay loam soil. Bovine slurry seeded with 5 \u00d7 109\nC. parvum oocysts was applied to the surface of soil blocks (80 cm \u00d7 56 cm \u00d7 20 cm) removed from a perennial ryegrass ley at an application rate equivalent to 50 m3/ha. The blocks were irrigated 24 h following slurry application and periodically thereafter. Samples of run-off (at 4 cm depth) and leachate (at 20 cm depth) were collected and the number of oocysts enumerated. After 70 days the blocks were destructively sampled and examined for the presence of oocysts. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Numbers of oocysts leaching from the blocks declined from 8.4 \u00d7 106 on day 1 to 2.3 \u00d7 104 at day 70. Oocysts levels were consistently lower in run-off compared with the leachate from the base of the soil blocks. Numbers fell below the limit of detection after 21 days and 28 days in two blocks, but were detectable in the third block for the duration of the experiment (70 days). These results suggest that oocysts tend not to become associated with soil particles, being either transported away in run-off or moving vertically downwards through the soil column. The majority of oocysts were retained in the top 2 cm of soil (Mawdsley et al., 1996b).",

There have been attempts to assess the risks posed by Cryptosporidium in drinking water supplies (Gale,P. 1996, 1999; Haas, 2000). However, the foodborne route has not been modelled, probably because of the received view that cryptosporidiosis is primarily waterborne, despite evidence demonstrating the potential for foodborne transmission. Cryptosporidium oocysts have been found on the surface of fresh, raw vegetables obtained from retail markets (Ortega et al., 1991; Monge et al., 1996). In the UK, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis affecting 50 school children was linked to the consumption of improperly pasteurized milk (Gelletli et al., 1997). In the USA, outbreaks have been associated with the drinking fresh-pressed apple juice (non-alcoholic cider) (Millard et al., 1994). Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with infected food-handlers demonstrate clearly the potential for significant foodborne transmission of Cryptosporidium (Besser-Wiek et al., 1996; Quiroz et al., 2000).",
