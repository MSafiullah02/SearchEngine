In this study, the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin (GL) on R5 HIV replication influenced by PMNs was investigated in MDM cultures. The replication of R5 HIV in MDMs was greatly enhanced when cells were co-cultured with freshly isolated PMNs (syngeneic to MDMs). When GL was added to this culture, however, the viral replication enhanced by PMNs was completely inhibited. CCL2 and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were produced in cultures of PMNs exposed to R5 HIV, and the replication of R5 HIV was greatly enhanced in MDM cultures supplemented with a mixture of recombinant CCL2 and IL-10. However, CCL2 and IL-10 were not produced by PMNs exposed to R5 HIV, when GL was added to the cultures. In the presence of GL, these soluble factors were not detected in co-cultures of MDMs and PMNs exposed to R5 HIV. In addition, the replication of R5 HIV in MDMs stimulated with CCL2 and IL-10 was not directly influenced by GL. These results indicated that GL suppresses the PMN-dependent increase of R5 HIV replication in MDMs through inhibiting CCL2/IL-10 production by PMNs stimulated with R5 HIV.",

            "text": "The major targets for HIV infection are cells expressing CD4 molecules and HIV entry co-receptors on the cell surface. The difference in chemokine receptors is important for the cellular tropism of HIV. The b-chemokine receptor, CCR5, is the major co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of HIV (R5 HIV), 1,2 whereas the a-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, facilitates entry of T-tropic HIV strains (X4 HIV). 3 The R5X4 HIV uses both CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors. [4] [5] [6] R5 HIV replicates in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), but not in primarily isolated monocytes. [7] [8] [9] As primarily isolated monocytes do not express CCR5 on their surface, R5 HIV cannot enter into the cells. 10, 11 X4 HIV replicates in cultures of T cells. 12 Recently, we showed that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) stimulate R5 HIV replication in MDMs. 13 Greatly increased replication of R5 HIV was shown in co-cultures or transwell cultures between MDMs exposed to R5 HIV and freshly isolated PMNs (syngeneic to MDMs). CCL2 and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were produced by PMNs exposed to R5 HIV, and the replication of R5 HIV was not accelerated in MDM/PMN transwell cultures supplemented with a mixture of mAbs (monoclonal antibodies) for CCL2 and IL-10. In contrast, the replication of R5 HIV was accelerated in MDM cultures supplemented with a mixture of recombinant CCL2 and IL-10. These results indicate that, through the production of CCL2 and IL-10, PMNs influenced by R5 HIV enhance the replication of R5 HIV in MDM cultures.",

Thus, PMNs (2\u00c210 6 cells ml \u00c01 ) stimulated with 1580 TCID 50 per ml of R5 HIV for 3 h, were washed with media, and cultured with GL (100 mg ml \u00c01 ) for an additional 18 h.

However, the production of CCL2 and IL-10 by PMNs exposed to the virus was greatly decreased (85-90% reduction), when cultures were performed with 100 mg ml \u00c01 of GL ( Figure 3 ).

            "text": "In our earlier studies, 14, 15 GL was shown to be inhibitory on the replication of R5 HIV in PBMCs from patients with R5 HIV infection, or MDMs exposed to R5 HIV. In these studies, the anti-HIV activity of GL was displayed through the induction of CCL4 and CCL5 production. One of the cellular entry sites of R5 HIV (CCR5) on the surface of target cells is blocked by these chemokines. [1] [2] [3] In addition, anti-R5 HIV activity of GL was shown in monocytes, which were previously treated with 1-methyladenosine. 15 CCR5 expression in monocytes was stimulated by CCL2 and IL-10, which were released from the same monocytes treated with 1-methyladenosine. However, in the presence of GL, CCL2 and IL-10 were not produced by monocytes treated with 1-methyladenosine. 15 In this paper, the inhibitory effect of GL on R5 HIV replication in MDMs co-cultured with PMNs was examined. The replication of R5 HIV in MDMs was greatly enhanced when these cells exposed to the virus were co-cultured with PMNs. Enhanced R5-HIV replication in MDMs co-cultured with PMNs was inhibited by 1-100 mg ml \u00c01 of GL. Over 95% inhibition of the viral replication was shown when GL at a dose of 100 mg ml \u00c01 was added to the cocultures. A 50% inhibition was shown when 1 mg ml \u00c01 of GL was added to the co-cultures. The non-cytotoxic properties of GL have been reported in many papers. 24-26 GL at concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 mg ml \u00c01 is not cytotoxic against various murine and human tissue culture cells. In addition, we tested the toxicity of GL on human PMNs. By trypan blue dye-exclusion test, 90% or more of PMNs were shown to be viable, after cultivation of healthy donor peripheral blood PMNs (1\u00c210 6 cells ml \u00c01 ) for 18 h with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 mg ml \u00c01 GL. Under microscopic examination, morphological changes of 18 h-cultured PMNs with GL were not shown. These previous descriptions and our data indicate that cytotoxic properties of GL are not involved in its antiviral activity against R5 HIV replication in MDMs co-cultured with PMNs. The antiviral mechanism of GL against enhanced replication of R5 HIV in MDMs co-cultured with PMNs was examined next. Some soluble factors released from PMNs have been indicated as effector molecules to enhance the replication of R5 HIV in MDMs, because the viral replication has been greatly enhanced in MDMs transwell cultured with PMNs. Indeed, the enhanced viral replication was not shown when a mixture of mAbs directed against CCL2 and IL-10 was added to this transwell culture. 13 In contrast, without PMNs, replication of R5 HIV was greatly enhanced in MDM cultures supplemented with a mixture of rCCL2 and rIL-10. In this study, the replication of R5 HIV was not enhanced in MDMs and PMNs transwell cultures supplemented with GL. However, the enhanced R5 HIV replication in * CCL2 (ng/ml) Figure 3 Effect of GL on CCL2 and IL-10 production by PMNs exposed to R5 HIV.

These results indicate that GL suppresses the enhanced replication of R5 HIV in MDMs transwell cultured with PMNs through the inhibition of CCL2 and IL-10 production from PMNs influenced by R5 HIV. In our assay system, MDMs previously exposed to 1580 TCID 50 per ml of R5 HIV (bottom chamber) were cultured with PMNs (upper chamber) in a double chamber transwell for 24 h. There is a possibility that, in this transwell culture (0.4 mm pore), small amounts of HIV could pass through the transwell membrane from the lower chamber to the upper chamber, and viral particles that pass through the membrane could stimulate PMNs to induce IL-10/CCL2 production. In addition, it has been described that HIV-infected monocytes have a function to produce high levels of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and IL-6. 27,28 Although in our system, we did not test the function of HIV-infected MDMs to produce TNF-a and IL-6, there is a possibility that MDMs exposed to HIV may have an ability to produce TNF-a and IL-6. In addition, small numbers of monocytes contaminating the PMN preparation may have a possibility to produce TNF-a and IL-6. As our PMN preparations utilized in the experiments were not completely pure (93% pure cells), further studies for the clarification of a role of TNF-a/IL-6 will be needed in our transwell-cultivation system.",

This indicates that CCL2 and IL-10 are inducible by viable R5 HIV (but not inactivated HIV) in cultures of PMNs.
