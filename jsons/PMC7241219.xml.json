            "text": "Simulation in neurosurgical training is becoming a prominent adjunct to classical intraoperative teaching of surgical skills and classroom didactics for anatomical education [1,2]. The implementation of duty hour requirements and other tools to decrease fatigue and resident burn-out have presented a challenge to institutions in providing both adequate quantity of and quality surgical procedural experience in order to produce well-trained surgical physicians [3]. In the field of neurosurgery specifically, the rarity of cases and relatively low general incidence of neurosurgical diseases compared to other surgical subspecialties presents additional challenges to ensure adequate trainee exposure to surgical pathology [4]. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) has provided a means for recreating key points of anatomy for anatomical and procedural learning, especially in the realm of spinal surgery [5]. The feasibility of creating low-cost but high-quality 3DP simulation has been investigated, with good results [6-8]. As the number of desktop 3DP continues to move into a standard workflow for many institutions, there remains a large shortage of simulator designs that do not require purchase or extensive assembly [9].",

Currently, the mainstay of surgical education is live operative experience, which has continued to remain unchanged for over a century. The recent world events have demonstrated the immediate need for research and innovation in producing broadly accessible simulators in order to maintain educational activities for surgical residents. Simulator designs for neurosurgical resident education and skills training can be developed and implemented using desktop 3D printing methods that are inexpensive and widely available [11-13]. This report describes a novel simulator design for spine anatomy and instruction of pedicle screw placement in the lumbar spine and provides a link to the Standard Tessellation Language (STL) file for immediate printing and use. This simulator can be used as an in-house or \u201ctake-home\u201d method of instructing residents in lumbar pedicle screw placement.",

This methodology has been shown to improve the teaching elements of simulators by directing learning objects to specific task-training [14,15]. The primary learning goal of the simulator was to instruct junior neurosurgical trainees in the anatomy and technique for pedicle screw placement in the lumbar spine. In order for this to be accomplished, the anatomical and physiologic components of the lumbar vertebrae needed to be replicated, apart from the creation of a simulated operative environment. The key components of the simulation that were included in the initial design planning were as follows: 1. representative surface anatomy of the L1-L5 vertebrae; 2. replication of the cortico-cancellous interface; 3. preservation of the natural anatomical location and direction of the lumbar pedicles at each level (e.g., lordosis); and 4. replication of an intraoperative environment with the operative field deep to a set surface level (i.e., located deep to a \u201cskin-level\u201d surface).",

            "text": "In order to produce lumbar vertebral models that adequately replicated normal surface anatomy and ultrastructure, an anonymized CT scan of the lumbar spine in an adult patient was acquired through formal IRB approval. The scan was inspected for any previous surgical defects or degenerative pathology that would interfere with the learning objectives for the simulation. The CT scan was uploaded into 3D Slicer (Slicer, v.4.0), an open-access DICOM (Digital Information and Communication in Medicine) viewing platform that allows for the creation of 3D anatomical models for 3DP and viewing. The L1-L5 vertebrae were individually selected using the threshold module, and the facet and intervertebral spaces were manually separated to produce individually segmented models of the lumbar vertebrae. This was accomplished by setting the threshold limits to 193-3,000 HU. Each lumbar vertebral model was then converted into an STL file. All five lumbar STL files were then uploaded into Meshmixer 2017 (Autodesk, San Rafael, CA), an open-access computer-assisted design (CAD) software platform that allows for manipulation and editing of STL files in a virtual space (Video 1). The L1-L5 STL files were inspected for the preservation of the anatomical elements allowing for proper identification of the pedicle (e.g., transverse process, mammillary process, pars interarticularis). Additionally, each model was edited in order to remove unnecessary infill elements that would consume unnecessary material and printing time, and also to prevent the creation of a hollow model for programming infill for replication of the cortico-cancellous interface. The lumbar vertebrae were then arranged in anatomical order, with preservation of the lumbar lordosis [16].",

The X-Y dimensions of the box were adjusted to provide adequate space superiorly to the L1 vertebra and inferiorly to the L5 vertebra, and medial/lateral to the transverse processes at each level. The Z dimension was adjusted in order to provide coverage of the superior level over the spinous processes, thus creating a \u201cwork-in-a-hole\u201d design for the finished simulation. The individual STL files were combined and saved as one object. The finished SpineBox STL file was then uploaded into ideaMaker (Raise3D Technologies, Irvine, CA), our laboratory\u2019s chosen software for slicing and G-code preparation. At this point in the design, the L1-L5 vertebral models were \u201cfloating\u201d within the simulator box and thus would not be able to be printed. Using the placement of support material within the slicing software, the L1-L5 vertebral models were connected to the floor of the simulator box, thus ensuring the ability to print the entire object in one session and minimizing assembly post-production. The sliced SpineBox STL file was converted into a G-code and printed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) on a Raise3D Pro Plus fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer (Raise3D Technologies, Irvine, CA).",

Still, the ability of training institutions to acquire such simulation without purchase or considerable assembly requirements remains limited [21,22]. In the current global scenario, it has become increasingly important to have access to learning tools that are mobile and independent of hospital-related conditions. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has diminished many neurosurgical learning opportunities throughout the world due to conference cancellations, decreased operating room utility, and quarantine policies [23]. In the present landscape of spine surgical simulation, a simulator design that is easily created and portable for dissemination to neurosurgical trainees does not exist. At our institution, we have implemented the use of CAD design and 3DP to construct the SpineBox simulator, which is cost-effective, disposable, and able to replicate the cortico-cancellous interface for pedicle screw placement while providing a surgical environment that enables trainees to operate in realistic conditions with respect to instrument depth.",

            "text": "3D printing has been made widely available with desktop FDM 3DP models that are inexpensive and have a relatively small learning curve [24]. The common thermoplastics used for FDM printing materials have similar properties to cortical and cancellous bone and have been investigated to replicate human vertebrae for pedicle screw placement with excellent results [14,19,25]. Combining 3DP thermoplastics with dual-material printing or injection techniques are also distinct advantages of FDM printing for vertebral simulation compared with other 3DP methods [26]. Many teaching institutions have implemented the use of 3DP into their curriculum for anatomy and surgical education due to the relatively low cost and convenience of creating \u201cin-house\u201d models [20,25,27-29]. Despite these advantages, there are currently a limited number of open-access and freely available STL files for the surgical simulation that have been validated. This is partly due to industrial motivation and the potential for commercialization of simulator designs, as well as limitations in the reproducibility of construction methods for the simulators themselves. Investigators have examined the use of 3DP vertebral models placed within a foam operative cavity to simulate pedicle screw placement for the thoracolumbar spine, with excellent results in face, content, and validation [22]. The constructed simulators have shown promise for providing a quality surgical experience for neurosurgical trainees learning to place pedicle screws. Other investigators have explored fiberglass texture cervical vertebral models created through a reverse molding technique with 3DP molds placed within polyvinyl alcohol derivatives to create a cervical laminectomy simulation, with excellent results for task training and objective skill assessment [21]. Now, more than ever, innovation in 3DP simulators such as these models must continue to be investigated and produced in order to assist with the ever-growing needs of the surgical community in training the next generation of surgeons.",

The individual vertebral models in the simulator are designed hollow in order to allow the user to create infill gradients with their chosen slicing software before printing, or to fill with porous foams that accurately replicate the material properties of cancellous bone. Both of these methods have been previously validated as accurate methods of simulating cortical and cancellous bone [12,13,17]. The space around the vertebral models within the housing box can also be easily filled with soft foam, cotton, silicone, or other materials in order to simulate soft tissue structures that can impede visualization during screw placement, and allows the use of retractors during the simulation. The spinal canal of the vertebral models is also patent and can be filled with a Penrose drain, latex tubing, or other methods to reproduce dura and/or cerebrospinal fluid if a laminectomy simulation is desired as well.",
