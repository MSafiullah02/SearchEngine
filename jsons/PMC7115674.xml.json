Those proteins have been purified from a diversity of flowering plants [8], [30], [31], [32], [33], [36], [37], animals [3], [28], bacteria [39], and fungi [34], [35]. Plant tissues that produce antifungal proteins and peptides comprise seeds [1], [2], [4], [6], [11], [30], [31], [36], bulbs [7], [32], leaves [10], [13], tubers [9], fruits [33], shoots [13], and roots [12]. Monocots [4], [6], [11], [13], [14], [25], [32], [37], dicots [9], [15], [16], [17], [24], [29], [33], [36], [38], [40], and gymnosperms [10], [30] have been reported to produce antifungal proteins.",

The different types include chitinases and chitinase-like proteins [29], chitin-binding proteins [2], [10], lipid transfer proteins [16], [17], protease inhibitors [11], [40], ribosome inactivating proteins [14], [24], embryo abundant protein-like proteins [30], thaumatin-like proteins [33], and defensin-like peptides [38]. To date, only one antifungal peptide has been reported from Brassica campestris seeds [16], [17] in spite of the presence of multiple Brassica species. In new of the structural diversity manifested by the various aforementioned antifungal proteins and the presence of different antifungal proteins even in the same species [9], [29], the intent of the present investigation was to isolate an antifungal peptide from the seeds of kale (Brassica alboglabra L.H. Bailey), another Brassica species, and to compare it with the antifungal peptide from B. campestris seeds [16] and other plant antifungal proteins.",

The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the antifungal peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the antifungal peptide [32], [33]\n.\n",

Antifungal activity resided only in fraction BG2, which was then resolved on SP-Sepharose into an unadsorbed fraction and three adsorbed fractions (SP1, SP2 and SP3) of approximately equal size which were desorbed with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1B). Antifungal activity was concentrated in fraction SP2. Fraction SP2 was separated on Mono S into a tiny unadsorbed fraction (S1) and two adsorbed fractions (S2 and S3) (Fig. 1C). Antifungal activity was detected in the sharp adsorbed fraction S2 eluted soon after application of the 0.3\u20130.6 M NaCl gradient. Final purification of S2 on Superdex Peptide resulted in a major and a tiny absorbance peak, the former representing purified antifungal peptide (Fig. 1D) with a molecular weight of 5.9 kDa in SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 2A). Its molecular weight as determined by mass spectrometry was 5907 Da (Fig. 2B). The yields of the chromatographic fractions with antifungal activity from 500 g seeds are as follows: crude extract (13765 mg), fraction BG2 (6648 mg), fraction SP2 (1023 mg), fraction S2 (342 mg) and purified antifungal peptide (32 mg). It differed from known Brassica antifungal proteins, napins and trypsin inhibitors in N-terminal sequence (Table 1\n). It lacked trypsin inhibitory activity toward casein and BAEE when tested up to 10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM, respectively (detailed data not shown). The peptide exerted antifungal activity against various fungal species including F. oxysporum (A), H. maydis (B), M. arachidicola (C), and V. mali (D) with the ranking of potency being D > C > B > A. The IC50 values were respectively 4.3 \u03bcM (A), 2.4 \u03bcM (B), 2.1 \u03bcM (C), and 0.15 \u03bcM (D) (Fig. 3\n). The antifungal activity of the peptide was retained after exposure to temperatures in the range 20\u201380 \u00b0C for 10 min (Fig. 4A) and to the pH ranges 2\u20133 and 10\u201311 for 30 min (Fig. 4B). It inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A) and MCF7 cells (Fig. 5B) with an IC50 of 2.7 \u03bcM and 3.4 \u03bcM, respectively, and reduced the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 4.9 \u03bcM (Fig. 5C). It was devoid of mitogenic activity, HIV-1 integrase inhibitory, and SARS proteinase inhibitory activities (data not shown).",

The present study constitutes the second report on the isolation of an antifungal peptide from the seeds of a Brassica species. The two Brassica antifungal peptides differ in N-terminal sequence. Both exhibit pronounced thermostability and pH stability, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells, and antifungal activity toward F. oxysporum, M. arachidicola and a Helminthosporium species. The antifungal peptide from kale (B. alboglabra L.H. Bailey) seeds did not exhibit trypsin inhibitory activity and also did not resemble B. napus trypsin inhibitor in N-terminal sequence. This is noteworthy in view of the fact that some of the trypsin inhibitors demonstrate antifungal activity [40] and that trypsin inhibitors and napins are produced by Brassica seeds. The two Brassica antifungal peptides were also isolated by using similar protocols. Ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S, and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide were used for isolation of B. campestris antifungal peptide, the only difference from the present protocol for kale antifungal peptide being replacement of SP-Sepharose by Q-Sepharose.",

In contrast, some antifungal proteins like mungbean chitinase [17] lack the last two activities. There are very few reports on the presence of defense proteins such as antifungal proteins, antiviral proteins, antibacterial proteins and lectins from B. alboglabra except for the demonstration of a napin-like peptide with antiproliferative, antibacterial and translation-inhibitory activities [23]. The antifungal peptide isolated in this study would add to the existing literature.",

After elution of unadsorbed proteins, the column was eluted stepwise with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl and then with 1 M NaCl added to the buffer as indicated by the arrows.
