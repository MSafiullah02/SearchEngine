Nowadays, many efforts to reduce sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are ongoing by nationwide quality improvement interventions including vigorous hand washing, catheter bundle management, increasing the diagnostic accuracy of sepsis and antibiotic stewardship6. However, it is still difficult to reduce the sepsis incidence to zero in NICU care because of the immature immunity systems of preterm infants and the different environments in each hospital which cannot be changed in a short time. Although the survival rate of VLBW infants is increasing by advances in neonatal care, the rate of sepsis is still higher in immature and smaller preterm infants.",

According to an analysis of the KNN database in 2014, the sepsis rate in VLBW infants in South Korea was 21.1%, and the late-onset sepsis (LOS) rate was 19.4% with a 16.1% mortality rate12. Such a sepsis rate is similar to that of the Canadian Neonatal Network, however, higher than that of the Neonatal Research Network of Japan13. We still do not know how much the sepsis rate differs from center to center in South Korea. Moreover, we do not know whether such differences in the sepsis rate are associated with a worse neonatal outcome in VLBW infants. Thus, it is necessary to determine the real status of the unit variation in the sepsis rate or the incidence density using the KNN database before starting a nationwide intervention for quality improvement to control sepsis in NICUs in South Korea.",

In our study, similar results were seen in that the GA in the LS group was significantly higher when compared to the IS or HS group.

Because we did not assess whether sepsis itself is an independent risk factor of mortality, BPD, and PVL in this study, we still cannot determine whether sepsis itself was the direct leading cause of the poorer neonatal outcomes or other factors that were associated with a higher sepsis rate led to such poorer neonatal outcomes. From many previous reports, numerous evidence has shown that sepsis itself is associated with increased mortality, BPD, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants1\u20135. Additionally, the many nationwide quality improvements by nationwide neonatal networks, such as Vermont-Oxford Network6 and Canadian Neonatal Network14, to reduce sepsis in units with a high sepsis rate, especially focusing on the LOS, were the most effective in improving neonatal outcomes6,14. Such a reduction in LOS also improved the survival of extremely preterm infants born at 23\u201326 weeks of gestation in a single tertiary hospital15. Moreover, quality improvement can have a spill-over effect from one outcome to another, and many common strategies are used to improve different outcomes. For example, the nosocomial infection rate was decreased not only in the evidence-based practice from improving quality methods (EPIQ) infection group but also in the EPIQ pulmonary group in the EPIQ trial by the Canadian Neonatal Network, which implies that decreasing the duration of invasive ventilator care is another important method to reduce the sepsis rate14. Nowadays, the Canadian Neonatal Network and Vermont-Oxford Network have adopted a multi-targeting quality improvement campaign simultaneously to improve the composite of morbidity and major neonatal outcomes, especially in extremely low GA infants16,17. That is why we think that nationwide quality improvement to control sepsis should be started first in Korea, considering that we cannot start multiple strategies for quality improvement at once.",

Actually, the gap in the incidence density of sepsis is larger between the HS and IS groups when compared with the gap between the IS and LS groups in our study population. Thus, decreasing the sepsis rate in the HS group will be very important and will be a main target of quality improvement in NICUs. Among the LOS infants, coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) is known to be the most prevalent cause of sepsis12; however, gram-negative or fungal sepsis is known to be associated with the highest risk of mortality or adverse outcomes in preterm infants3,18. CONS is also a well-known bacteria associated with an increased risk of BPD19,20. Gram-positive organisms are usually associated with catheter-related bloodstream infection, and gram-negative organisms are more commonly seen in NEC patients18. In our cohort, CONS was the most prevalent causal organisms of sepsis, especially in the HS group, and there was no significant difference in the prevalence of fungal sepsis between the three groups. A quality improvement program with strategies to reduce CONS sepsis such as a central catheter bundle, reducing the duration of central catheter insertion, and hand washing will be important in improving neonatal outcomes in the NICUs of South Korea. Because the duration of invasive ventilator care and the days to full feeding were longer in the HS group, reducing invasive ventilation, prompt extubation as soon as possible, and an earlier start of enteral feeding will be also helpful to reduce the sepsis rate and to improve neonatal outcomes.",

Besides well-known risk factors of sepsis such as GA and patient status at admission, the differences in daily clinical practices caused the center-to-center variation of the sepsis rate11. Unfortunately, in this study, we could not get such information from the KNN database; we could only get the information about the group of mean annual number of VLBW infants registered in KNN, which showed no significant difference between three groups. When we performed the multivariate logistic regression analysis with random intercepts adjusting for GA and the hospital groups after the propensity score matching, the results were not much changed from those of the analysis with multivariate logistic regression only adjusting for GA after propensity score matching. Those groups can represent some portion or quality of the NICU size; however, more information about the NICU levels, i,e, secondary, tertiary, or quarternary units, the presence of other supporting parts such as neonatal surgery, and the presence of a perinatal center or regional NICU center are needed to be judged first whether the hospital level influences the sepsis rate.

            "text": "The limitations of our study were as follows; first, we could not perform a cluster analysis at the individual hospital level at which the individual infant was admitted because it was a policy that the KNN did not provide any data about the individual hospital at which any infant was admitted. We tried to compensate for those problems by performing the multivariate logistic regression analysis with random intercepts adjusting for the hospital groups divided according to the number of registered VLBWs in the KNN. Second, we still could not clearly determine whether sepsis itself or other factors associated with a higher sepsis rate led to such poorer neonatal outcomes. Further studies should be done focusing on this problem. Third, we could not collect information about the duration of central catheter use although days to full feeding can be an indicator suggesting the duration of central catheter use. We also could not get information on staff such as the nurse to patient ratio and the unit size such as tertiary or secondary hospital. Further studies will be needed to determine the risk factors that lead to the difference in the incidence of sepsis between the three groups including the staff and facilities of the NICUs. Fourth, we could not determine the order of the outcomes, so we could not determine the cause and result relationships between sepsis and other outcomes except for BPD or ROP. That\u2019 is why we performed logistic regression analysis for only death, BPD, PVL, and survival without major morbidities. Fifth, we could not get information on the duration of antibiotic use and the antibiotic resistances of each organism from our KNN database. Considering that antibiotic resistance can also be a risk factor for a longer duration of antibiotic use and disease severity, a more sophisticated design for a prospective study including such information should be done later.",

The GA and birthweight were more mature and heavier in the LS group when compared with the IS or HS group; however, there was no difference in the GA and birthweight between the IS and HS groups. Adverse neonatal outcomes including mortality, BPD, and PVL were higher in the HS group when compared with the LS and IS groups; however, there were no significant differences between the LS and IS groups, even after the propensity score matching. Other factors besides GA and birthweight in the HS group might be associated with worse neonatal outcomes. A future prospective cohort study that includes antibiotic use, patient care techniques, hand washing rate, and catheter insertion duration to assess the risk factors associated with center to center variability will be helpful to perform further nationwide interventions for quality improvement in infection control at NICUs.",

Comparisons of the maternal demographics and neonatal characteristics among the LS, IS, and HS groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Comparison of the groups according to the mean annual number of VLBW infants registered in KNN was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test. For multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied. Because the GA and birthweight were significantly higher in the LS group when compared with the IS or HS group and there were significant differences in the many maternal and neonatal demographics among the three groups, propensity score matching was considered to minimize the selection bias. To derive the propensity scores, multivariate logistic regression for the pairwise groups was conducted with GA, gender, SGA, multiple pregnancies, cesarean section, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, HCA, oligohydramnios, complete course of steroid use, delivery room resuscitation, and 5-minute Apgar score. Since the correlation between GA and birthweight was highly positive, only GA was included as an adjusting factor in the propensity score matching. By first matching the LS to IS, LS to HS, and the IS and HS groups based on their propensity scores using the nearest neighbor matching algorithm, three-group propensity score matched dataset was generated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with random intercepts were performed to account for hospital group effects according to the mean annual number of VLBWs registered in KNN, with adjustment for GA on mortality, moderate to severe BPD, severe BPD, PVL, and survival without major morbidities (moderate to severe BPD, NEC \u2265 stage 2, IVH \u2265 grade 3, PVL, ROP requiring surgery or VEGF treatment) in matched sets. Comparison of the distribution of pathogens between three groups were performed by chi-square test.
