The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased in two critically ill patients, who remained in ICU with disease durations of over 20 days. More abnormalities in cytokine spectrum were seen in critically ill patients than in severe patients. Huang et al. [5] also found that COVID-19 patients in ICU had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-\u03b1, compared with non-ICU patients. Conversely, severe SARS patients had very low levels of IL-10 [30]. Different inflammatory responses were found between SARS and COVID-19, so more researches are needed.
