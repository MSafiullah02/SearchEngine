From January to September 2004, 237 patients who fulfilled the patient selection criteria were classified into control group (Figure 1A\n). From October 2004 to March 2005, all nursing staffs in ICU were informed why the study would be done, how the staffs would execute the intervention, and why the compliance of the intervention would be maintained high enough. Change of body position every 2 hours except for routine mouth care in the early morning was the routine nursing protocols in our ICU. The intervention was suction of oral secretions before each positional change. Other suction of oral secretions was allowed if clinically indicated. The suction of oral secretions was performed to clear the oral secretions as completely as possible and the suction tube was not extended into the oropharyngeal space. Accordingly, the patients in the studied group received additional 11 times of suction of oral secretions. The compliance of intermittent suction of oral secretions was monitored by self-report and checked randomly by senior staff during the education phase. The intervention phase of the study was started from April 2005, because the compliance of the intervention was >8/11 times in every staff. From April to October 2005, there were 227 patients who met the selection criteria were classified into studied group (Figure 1B). The institute review board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital approved this study, and a written informed consent was obtained from all patients or patients\u2019 next of kin before the study.",

The heterogeneity of the patients as the study conducted in a combined medical and surgical ICU may confound the results or the effect of intervention. The value of intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change in reducing late-onset VAP remains unknown because late-onset VAP was not found in this study. However, the results of the present study can be clinically relevant because all patients studied came from the same ICU and were treated with same protocol except for the intervention evaluated in the studied group. This may decrease or avoid inherent bias caused by different patient population, nursing protocols, and quality of medical and nursing staffs in particular in multicenter studies or in a study conducted simultaneously in different ICUs at a same hospital. Further prospective and randomized studies with larger population are needed to verify these issues.",
