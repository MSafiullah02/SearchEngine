For example, records from the fifth century B.C. suggest that influenza pandemics were observed in ancient Greece. In Europe, during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, numerous concordant reports from different countries describe epidemics of respiratory infections that resemble influenza pandemics. However, it is not possible to be certain that these epidemics were due to influenza. In the twentieth century, three influenza pandemics have occurred, including the deadly Spanish flu pandemic. Modern virology has unravelled the mechanisms of emergence of pandemic viruses, and considerable knowledge on influenza viruses has been accumulated. The picture is now clear: influenza A is a zoonotic virus whose reservoir is in wild birds. In rare cases, these avian viruses are introduced into man and, eventually, become pandemic viruses. Although these mechanisms are now understood, the time frame required for adaptation of the avian virus to its new host remains unknown. Maybe the next pandemic will show us how rapid this adaptation can be.",

Nevertheless, even if records of past epidemics describe diseases with clinical presentation resembling influenza infections, it is difficult to be certain that these epidemics of the past were the consequence of emerging influenza viruses. Recent knowledge has revealed that pandemic viruses emerge from the avian reservoir (Scholtissek 1994) . In some cases, the emerging influenza requires adaptation before its dissemination in man. This adaptation can be achieved in an intermediate host, e.g. pigs or possibly poultry (Russell and Webster 2005) . The history of pandemics seems to have started very early in mankind; some assume that influenza viruses could have become zoonotic and subsequently adapted to man when poultry started to be raised for food.",

It is clear that the emergence and subsequent adaptation of the deadly A H1N1 virus took several months or even years before the start of the outbreak. This virus hit the whole world very badly within a very short time. In the early stages of the pandemic, in 1916, a French report describes a small-scale epidemic with a very high infection rate in a medium-sized city in the south of France, with very few fatalities. Similar cases were observed in the troops of both sides during the first World War (WWI), but due to the embargo on news because of the war, there was no dissemination of this information.",

The virus then swept through the United States before spreading to the rest of the world (Iezzoni 1999) . The second possibility is that the virus originated from the United States directly. The first cases were recorded in March 1918, and the first epidemic clusters described were located in a military camp in Furston (now called Fort Riley in Kansas), in Detroit, and in a prison in South Carolina (Soper 1918 ). Subsequently, the virus spread over a large part of the United States. Meanwhile, military troops sent to Europe landed in France in Brest and Bordeaux. These boats were loaded with infected soldiers. In some cases, numerous deaths were recorded during the journey across the Atlantic Ocean. The virus was introduced into Europe and cases were subsequently recorded in the French and British armies. The virus then spread to Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia. North Africa was hit in June 1918, and cases were also recorded in India, Asia and New Zealand. Until June, the pandemic was significant but no worse than previous pandemics (Niall et al. 2002) . A limited number of fatal cases were recorded, mainly amongst young children and the elderly. This was only the first wave.",

Taubenberger, the A H1N1 virus that has been reconstructed shows similarities with avian viruses . These similarities are observed at the level of the viral nucleic acid sequences. However, analysis of the proteins shows that this virus has signatures of mammalian influenza. It is still not clear if this virus was transmitted directly from birds to man of if an intermediate host was involved. There is no record of any epidemic in poultry prior to the human pandemic. One of the differences between avian and human viruses is that they bind to different receptors (Gamblin et al. 2004; Glaser et al. 2005) . Hence, a key element of the adaptation of an influenza virus to its new host is the acquisition of mutations that allow binding to the human cellular receptor. Sequences of the A H1N1 virus detected in material collected from cases that died of influenza in 1918 show a receptor binding site intermediate between avian and human, as if the virus was developing mutations to adapt to its new host (Gamblin et al. 2004 ).

It can infect birds (avian viruses), man (human viruses) but also other hosts including pigs (Scholtissek 1994) . Pigs are interesting animals in the biology of influenza viruses since they can be infected by human viruses as well as viruses of avian origin. In birds, influenza viruses can be endemic, and numerous subtypes can circulate in wild and domestic birds (Ferguson et al. 2003; Munster et al. 2007; Scholtissek 1994) .",

In 1984, Scholtissek suggested that a pig had been co-infected by the human A H1N1 virus and an avian A H2N2 virus. During this co-infection, several cells of the host were co-infected and the gene segments coding for the two surface proteins (H2 and N2) were substituted with the respective gene segments of the human virus, together with a third gene segment, PB1 (coding for one of the three proteins of the polymerase complex). This reassortment resulted in a new virus with a human genetic background (five gene segments coming from the H1N1 virus) and new surface glycoproteins. This virus was adapted for dissemination in man and resulted in a new pandemic virus.",

The mechanism for this drastic change remains unknown. We can assume a very high attack rate for an emerging virus for which nobody yet has neutralising antibodies, and it can thus spread very efficiently. Virus spread can be expressed by the reproducibility factor, R 0 , which is the mean value of the number of secondary cases per index case. The R 0 value varies according to the transmissibility of the virus: a highly transmissible virus will have a high R 0 . To initiate an epidemic, a virus must have an R 0 >1. This value is used to construct theoretical models for the putative next pandemic (Longini et al. 2005) . It was determined that the R 0 value of seasonal flu is approximately 1.4. On the other hand, the R 0 value of an emerging pandemic virus like the 1918 virus was >2 or 3.

Such introductions must be taken very seriously. In 1976, at Fort Dix, New Jersey (USA) a soldier felt ill with flu. He died very rapidly after a training march exercise. This case was investigated and an A H1N1 virus was isolated. At that time, only the A H3N2 virus was present in man. The United States authorities feared the re-emergence of a deadly H1N1 virus and initiated a very large vaccination program. The vaccine was produced and administered to 48 million United States citizens. The vaccination program was stopped because of adverse side effects, and the lack of further cases of infection with this virus.
