Our brief operative times and absence of complications support this laparoscopic technique as a reasonable approach in the management of cecal polyps. Gastrointestinal lymphangioma is a rare entity. These benign tumors are composed of abnormally dilated lymphatic channels.

The application of these techniques for gastric cancer requires further assessment. We think Videe-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is useful for pul monary metastatectomy. Resection of solitary pulmonary metastasi., from colorectal carcinoma provides additional survival and we think VAT~ should be chosen for this procedure. Objectives: To evaluate the usefulness of VATS for pulmonary metastate ctomy of colorectal carcinomas. Methods: Twenty-one cases of pulmonary metastatectomy of colorecte carcinoma were performed from January 1985 to December 1999. Nin, out of 21 cases were treated with VATS, 12 were treated with standan thoracotomy. We compare the patient_fs back ground, operative time volume of blood loss, use of analgesics, hospital stay, medical costs, an~ survival between VATS group and thoracotomy group. Additionally, medi astinal lymph nodes sampling were performed five out of nine VAT, c cases to determine whether mediastinal lymph node dissection is nece~ sary or not. Results: The mean of operative time, blood loss during operation, dur~ tion of epidural analgesia, and post-operative hospital stay is 105 rain., 3 ml, 3 days and 8 days in VATS group and 137 min., 72 ml, 6 days, an 16 days in thoracotomy group. There are no differences of medical cost between two groups because of expensive disposable devices. Thre out of nine VATS cases were dead and 6 were alive. Eight out of 12 the racotomy cases were dead and 4 were alive. The mean survival time an observation time after pulmonary procedure is 32.6 and 35.6 months i VATS group and 43.2 and 95.0 months in thoracotomy group. None ( five cases, which were performed VATS metastatectomy and mediastin= lymph nodes sampling, showed mediastinal lymph nodes involvement. Conclusions: 1, VATS metastatectomy is better way than metastatectorr via standard thoracotomy for solitary pulmonary metastasis of colorec~ carcinoma, because of its shorter hospital stay, less invasivenese, at~ equal pest-operative survival. 2, Mediastinal lymph nodes dissection not necessary for solitary pulmonary metastasis of colorectal carcinoma Background: Endoscopic robotic devices may overcome the limitations of conventional laparoscopic instruments. The distally articulated instruments utilize additional degrees of freedom useful when performing complex endoscopic maneuvers. Most robotic systems, however, lack haptic feedback. We assessed the performance of surgically naive participants using a robotic device versus conventional laparoscopic instruments. Methods: 10 medical students were given three endoscopic tasks to perform with the robot (BrockRogers, Norwr MA) and conventional laparoscopic instruments: peg transfer, pattern tracing, and needle driving in axial and non-axial orientations. For the robot, pattern tracing was performed on fiat and cushioned surfaces. Performance was assessed on the basis of timing and accuracy. Results: The average time to complete the peg transfer was 76+-25 sec for the conventional vs 120+-50 sec for the robot (10=0.0069) with similar error rates. Pattem tracing was performed faster with the conventional, 69+-30 sec vs. the robot (flat and cushioned surface), 122+-47 sec (p=0.004). When tracing on a hard surface, the robot group had a significantly greater number of errors than the conventional group. Tracing on a cushioned surface that provided visual clues to the amount of pressure applied reduced the robot error to the level of the conventional group and was significantly lower than robot tracing on a flat surface. For the needle driving task, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of timing or errors with the exception of superior time and accuracy for the robot working in the 12 -6 o'clock orientation versus off-axis conventional suturing. Conclusion: Articulated robotic instruments improve performance when driving a needle in a non-axial direction. Despite the tele-manipulator's ability to maneuver with greater degrees of freedom, the surgically naive operator is hindered by the lack of haptic feedback. The use of certain visual clues seems to partially ameliorate this loss. Introduction: For the past decade, the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has mainly been limited to a single technique: commencing dissection of the gallbladder at the infundibulum, and proceeding upwards toward the fundus. Descriptions of fundus down cholecystectomy have been reported in recent surgical literature, but these techniques often involve additional pertWtrocar sites, special liver retractors, or use of the harmonic scalpel. While these methods have been successful, they often increase the cost and time associated with performing fundus down cholecystectomy.",

We use the same trocars and instruments that we routinely employ in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As is usually done, we first bluntly dissect the cystic duct and cystic artery in the triangle of Calot. Then, we perform our fundue down dissection by using two 5 mm smooth graspers, with which to create a fold in the peritoneum at the apex of the gallbladder. Hook electrocautery is used to start the dissection. One forceps is then placed on the tag of peritoneum left on the apex of the liver bed, and the other is used to grasp the gallbladder, providing adequate countertrection to continue the fundus down dissection with electrecautery. As we near the infundibulum, any branches of the cystic artery are ligated with clips, and the gallbladder is removed from the liver bed.",

We developed an IOC interpretation score(IOCscore) with 1 point assigned for each of the following: cystic duct, intra-& extrahepatic ducts,filling defects & flow into the duodenum. RESULTS: 52 IOC's were performed in 59 patients. 45 females & 14 males had a mean age of 49.4 years(20-80) . Indication for operation was biliary colic(38),acute cholecystitis(8),gallstone pancreatitis(6),biliary dyskinesia(4),other(3). Mean surgeon & radiologist IOC score was 4.3 & 3.0 respectively. The radiologist never read 2 cases, and dictated 9 as \"see op note\". The most commonly omitted details were the cystic duct (surg-21,rad-18) and intrahepatic ducts (surg-11,rad-17) . Other details were rarely omitted. Nearly all of the surgeon's interpretations were recorded the day of surgery. Radiologist reading was dictated an of average 4.4 days (1-8) after the study was completed. There was one case of discordant interpretation between readers that presented with acute cholangitis, had pre-op ERCP/sphincterotomy and extraction of 1 of 2 stones. At operation, clearance of the duct was successful laparoscopically. The final IOC interpretation by the radiologist was \"filling defect in CBD\", and surgeon as no filling defects. Cholangifls developed 4 months later with widely patent ampulla & no CBD stones on ERCP. 2 cases of retained CBD stones presented 3&4 days post.op, both managed with ERCP. One case revealed CBD stones cleared laparoscopically with the final IOC interpreted as normal by the surgeon. Radiologist interpretation was \"see cp note\". The other case was for acute cholecystitis. Filling defects noted on IOC were interpreted as air bubbles by the surgeon, and as \"normal, but limited study\" by the radiologist. CONCLUSION: Interpretation of IOC by surgeons who routinely perform IOC is comparable to a radiologist, and eliminating this step should lower the overall cost of IOC with no disadvantage. Objective: Some surgeons are preferred to cut the meshes half way in size and lay half of it under the cord structures. However, numbers of surgeons leaves the meshes over the spermatic structures without cutting. We compared these two different way of mesh placement technique and recorded the duration of dissecting, mesh placement and total operating pedods, with surgeon and patient satisfactions.",

However, these patients have often had peritoneal dialysis catheters, episodes of peritonitis and there is concem regarding the effecd of the pneumoperitoneum on renal graft function. At our institution, a team approach has been used to successfully complete bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy in a renal transplant patient. The team comprises a General Surgeon and Urologist who have fellowship training in advanced laparoscopic procedures. The patient is a 51 year old female with a renal transplant and document. ed vesico-ureteric reflux. Despite combined antibiotic therapy she continued to have symptomatic bacteriuria and recurrent pyelonephritis Ultrasound demonstrated bilateral hydronephrotic kidneys with thin parenchyma. The patient underwent bilateral nephrectomy via a transperitoneal approach. She was positioned in right decubitus for left nephrectomy, all port sites were closed after the completion of the procedure and ths patient re-positioned in left decubitus for right nephrectomy. For this procedure, 4 trocars were used on each side: 1-10mm trocar and 3-5mm tro. cars. Specimens were morcellized through the 10mm trocar sites. Tota OR time, including repositioning and sterile preparation was 6.5 hrs, There were no intra-operative or post-operative complications.

Furthermore if ~'ocar site metastases are related to the deposition of tumour cells within trocar sites, this may also have a role in helping to reduce the rate of trecar site metastases. Aims: The purpose of this study was to review our surgical technique and results in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated laparoscopically. Methods: From Feb. 1996 -March 2000 patients with GIST underwent laparoscopic resection. Data were obtained reu'ospectively by review of medical records and by telephone interview with patients. Data are reported as mean + SD. Results: Mean patient age was 64 + 14. years (range 42-88 yrs). Presenting features were upper GI bleed (N=9), reflux (N--2), and incidental finding (N--l). Ten tumors were in the stomach, one in the distal esophagus, and one in the jejunum. Mobilization was carried out with an ulU'asonic coagulator and tumor excision with a linear stapler, either totally laparoscopically (8 cases) or in a laparoscopic-assisted fashion (4 cases). Concurrent intraoperative gastroscopy was used in 9 cases. Mean operative time was 142 _+ 61 rain and blood loss averaged 90 + 107 ml. Ten tumors were removed by wedge excision and 2 required resection and reanastomosis (antrectomy in 1, jejunal resection in I). Patients ate a regular diet at 2.7 + 2.2 days postoperatively and median postoperative hospitalization was 3 days. Complications were a hypertensive exacerbation in 1 patient and a peripancreatic fluid collection and prolonged ileus in one patient. Mean tumor size was 4.2 :l: 1.4 cm (range 1.8-6cm) with negative margins in all cases. Tumors were benign in 7 cases, indeterminate in 3 cases, and malignant in 2 cases. There have been no further episodes of GI bleeding, or tumor recurrences at a mean follow-up interval of 20 months (range 4-54 mos) postoperatively. Conclusions: Lapasoscopic resection of GIST is safe and should be the preferred surgical approach unless the tumor is locally invasive. The timing of PEG placement has implications regarding discharge planning in hospitalized patients. Endoscopists have avoided placing PEGs in patients with clinical evidence of active infection for fear of a higher rate of complications. This study investigates the incidence of wound complications in patients with active infection undergoing PEG placement.",

Further, iaparotomy is associated with greater postoperative immunosuppression and increased tumor cell proliferation than either pneumoperitoneum (pneumo) or anesthesia alone. It has been demonstrated, in a munne model, that sham iaparotomy is associated with a higher incidence of lung mets than C02 pneumo. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of lung mets after open and laparoscepic-assisted bowel resection. Methods: A murine pulmonary metastasis model was used. Six week old female A/J mice(n=30) were randomized into 3 groups: 1) anesthesia control(AC), 2) laparoscopic cecectomy under C02 pneumo(LC), or 3) open cecectomy (OC). Immediately after the procedure, all animals were given tail vein injections of 7.5 x 10'~4 TA3Ha tumor cells. After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and the lungs/trachea exdsed en bloc after injection the trachea with India ink. The lungs were later immersed in Feket's solution to bleach the tumor nodules. Surface metastases were counted by a blinded observer. Results: The mean number of lung mets for the groups were: AC, 36; LC, 71.2; and OC, 124.4. The OC group had significantly more mets than the AC group(p<0.05, Mann-Whitney Test). There were no significant differences noted when the LC group was compared to eider the AC or OC groups. Conclusion: Open cecectomy is associated with significantly more lung metastases than anesthesia alone, in this model. Although laperoscopic cecectomy resulted in less mets than the open group the difference was not significant. Although not proven in this study, these differences may be the result of laparotomy related immunosuppression and trophic stimulation of tumor cells. Further studies are needed to assess whether laparoscopic procedures are, in fact, associated with a lower rate of metastases. We present a review of our experience of 1670 inguinal herniorrhaphy over the past 8 years, 1350 cases treated by laparoscopic approach (TAPP technique), and 320 by conventional tension-free open technique. We compare the results (patients compliance, post-operative pain, recurrences, morbidity) of the laparoscopy with open herniorrhaphy. This is a retrospective review of 1670 inguino-femoral hernias treated between August 1992 and March 2000. The laparoscopic approach was exclusively the trans-abdominal pro-peritoneal (TAPP) technique, it was performed in 948 patients (1350 hernias), 276 (20,3%) were recurrent hernias, 855 males and 93 females (ratio: 9/1), median age of 45,6 years (range:19-82).

The robotic system is readily mastered by OR assistants, and technical expertise is easily gained by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Telemanipulative robotically assisted choleoysteotomy can be performed safely, and this technique may well be applicable to more complex laparoscopic procedures. Objective: Visible contrast during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is limited by available light. We devised and tested a novel method of improving perception of low contrast detail in 'real time'. Methods: Video images were obtained using a standard color video camera and a 10mm 0degree laparoscope. Images were digitized and analyzed in 'real time' utilizing a digital signal processor. Images were displayed using a NTSC standard video monitor. Custom software was designed to allow display of the actual camera output or the digital sum the most recent 2, 3, or 4 frames. This yields an effective frame rate of 30, 15, 10, and 7.5 fps, respectively. Target images of known contrast were created. Random sequences of 12 numbers of density 0.5000 (1.0000 = black, 0.0000 = white) were printed on backgrounds with densities that varied between 0.4875 and 0.5 in 7 steps of 0.00125. Contrast was defined as the difference between character and background density divided by character density. Thus, contrast was varied between 0.025 and 0. Normal volunteers (n=14) were used to determine the readability of the target images. The actual number of errors was recorded for each of the seven (12 digit) targets at each of 4 frame rates. An analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine differences between frame rates. Results: There was a significant improvement (p<0.0003) in readability as frame rate was reduced for all targets with contrast between 0.0250 and 0.0125. Improvement with each frame rate reduction was greatest for images with the poorest contrast. A 10-fold improvement in readability was seen at 7.5 fps with a target contrast of 0.0125. Conclusions: Multiple frame integration, with a consequent decrease in effective frame rate, results in a significant improvement in identification of low contrast detail. Future work to determine applicability of this method to various surgical procedures is warranted. Minimally invasive surgical techniques and procedures continue to evolve.

We conclude that laparoscopic exploration for trauma in hemodynamicaily stable patient can be safely performed. All principles of abdominal exploration for trauma can be adhered to while utilizing three 5-mm ports. The advantage of laparoscopic technique is not only to determine the need for laparotomy, but also to provide therapy for stable patients using minimally invasive techniques. A prospective study is needed to determine the role of advanced laparoscopy in managing the stable trauma patient suspected of having an intraabdominal injury. Introduction: The objective of this study was to develop and implement an Intemet-based data entry and management system for use in clinical research. Currently, clinical data collection frequently relies upon information transfer from static paper forms to database programs. Database files often reside on one or more desktoptlaptop computers and are subject to inadvertent deletion, asynchronous merging, and breaches of confidentiality. Methods: A template-driven Intemet data collection and reporting tool was developed using Cold Fusion, r. v 4.0. The application and database were housed on an iPprotected Windows NT, r. server using a secure socket layer. A main menu page provided options for entering and accessing patient data, updating relational tables, and viewing statistics. The templates were compiled by the system and contained information regarding the data to be collected, forms generation and validation, relational tables, and data reporting and analysis. The application was applied to a retrospective surgical series of patients who underwent treatment for rectal cancer. Results: Pre-, intra-, and postoperative clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and pathologic data on >200 patients were successfully entered from multiple locations by several investigators. The database could be downloaded only by users with the highest security access. Study statistics were obtained and will be demonstrated with the application. Conclusions: Intemet-based clinical research systems provide an efficient, secure, and versatile means for collecting and reporting data. The application supported revisions in forms generation, data collection, and data analysis. Monitodng features alerted the investigators as to which subjects needed more data. This approach centralized the database and provided numerous portals for data entry. Although an initial capital investment in software, hardware, and Intemet connections were required, this technology can be applied to numerous clinical investigations and may result in overall costsavings Objective: This prospective randomized trial was undertaken to determine if patients undergoing an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be discharged home 4 hours postoperatively with similar levels of pain and nausea, similar complication and readmission rates and equal satisfaction as patients kept overnight. Methods: All patients presenting for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent randomization to an outpatient group (OPD) who were discharged alter a 4 hour postoperative stay, or an inpatient group (IP), admitted ovemighL Variables measured were degree of pain (scale of 1-10) and nausea/vomiting (scale of 1.4), amount of pain and nausea medication taken, number of phone calls, readmissions or complications, and degree of satisfaction with their procedure (scale of 1-4). Statistical analysis was performed with t-test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Results' Eighty patients were initially enrolled. Two were converted and 4 required admission after being randomized to outpatient, leaving 37 OPD and 37 IP. The OPD patients received more oral pain medication prior to discharge (2.1 doses vs 0.8 p<0.05). However, their degree of pain was similar to IP patients (4.2 vs 4.3). Phone calls, readmission rates and complication rates were similar in both groups. Patient satisfaction was 3.8 at one month for both groups. Conclusions: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, who are discharged home at 4 hours postoperatively, will experience the same satisfaction with no increase in complications as patients kept ovemighL Selected patients should be offered outpatient management following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",

A laparoscopic approach may be considered a feasible and safe alternative to an open operation. Selective angiography has been demonstrated to be extremely useful in the diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding of obscure origin.One of the advantages of angiography is the ability to control the bleeding either by mesenteric vasopressin infusion or supraselective transcatheter embolization.However, the risk of complications,especially bowel isquemia,is not dismissable.Laparoscopic-assisted small bowel resection is easy and allows a fast recovery.However, most of the lesions causing bleeding may be difficult to lecalize.The aim here was to investigate the utility of angiography-guided methilene-blue staining in the laparoscopic treatment of small bowel lesions causing GI bleeding.Between October 1999 and August 2000,we treated 4 patients with diagnosis of lower GI bleeding originated in the small bowel.Mean age was 61.5 years(2 males/2 females).Bleeding was chronic in 3 patients and massive in 1 .Previous diagnostic workup, inciuding endoscopy and scintigraphy was normal.Angiography of the superior mesenteric artery identified small hypervascularized lesions in the ileum in all 4 patients.There was extravasation of contrast in 2 cases.Before the operation, a microcatheter was placed in the most distal branch supplying the lesion. Pneumoperitoneum was established by the Veress technique.The laparoscope was inserted by a 12-ram trocar placed infraumbilically and the small bowel loops were explored.Four ml of methilane-blue were infused and staining of a short segment of the ileum was observed.Laparoscopic-assisted resection was performed and a side to side extracorporeal stapled anastomosis was done by a 4-cm incision in the righl lower quadrant.Postoperative course was uncomplicated and the mear postoperative hospital stay was 3.2 days.Histopathological evaluatior showed acute ulcers in 2 cases,angiodysplasia in 1 patient and lymphoma in 1 case.There was no recurrence of bleeding.Angiography-guided methilane blue staining is an easy and safe technique that facilitates ident]ficatior of small bowel bleeding lesions prior to laparoscopic resection. The three most frequently used badatnc surgeries are the Roux--en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), the vertical banded gaskopiasty (VBG) and the adjustable gastnc banding (AGB). The RYGBP has achieved better weight loss in long-term follow-up. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the results of the association of VBG to RYGBP performed iaparoscopically (LVBG-RYGB).",

We evaluated our initial experience with this procedure in the pediatric population. Methods: Fifteen adolescents underwent ileocolic resection for documented Crohn disease. Retrospective analysis of intraoperative and early post-operative results was done, comparing those undergoing the laparoscopic-assisted approach with those having open resection. Data were compared using Student ttest. Results: Eight adolescents (mean age 15.6yrs) underwent open resection and 7 (mean age 16.2 yrs) underwent laparoscopicassisted resection. No patient had undergone previous resection. The two groups did not differ with respect to time from diagnosis to surgery, indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy, or length of intestine resected. Operative time for the laparoscopic-assisted group was slightly longer than for the open group (160 vs.130 rain), but this was not statistically significant. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. While no statistically significant differences were noted for number of days of narcotic, total dose of narcotic, and time to resumption of regular diet, the patients undergoing laparoscopicassisted resection were discharged 2 days earlier (5 vs. The aim of this case series was to assess the feasibility of a totally laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass (LABF) for aortoiliac occlusive disease.",

Competent performance of laparoscopic skills is not developed in a straight linear fashion; time must be allocated for the maturation of the judgmental aspects of these skills. Laparoscopic colon surgery belongs to the category of the more difficult ones to perform. Specially, low anterior resections or abdominoperineal resection are operations that take a long time. An insertion of a hand of an operating surgeon into the abdominal cavity makes the operation simpler and faster. METHODS: We use a special device, Japanese hand-port LAPDISC, which allows a surgeon to insert a hand into abdomen cavity while preserving pneumoperintoneum. For low anterior resections or abdominoperineal resections we perform an incision of 7.5 cm (3 in) in the left lower abdomen. In this short incision we input a hand-pert LAPDISC. This multi-functional device allows a small opening for a laparoscopic instrument, or a wide opening for an insertion of a hand into the abdomen cavity, or a complete closure of the hand-port while preserving the pneumoperitoneum. The addition of an antireflux procedure during Heller myotomy for achalasia is controversial. We report the incidence of reflux and the rate of esophageal clearance for solid food following laparoscopic Heller myotomy with and without Dor fundoplication in 25 patients.",

Knowing the \"Gassless\" Laparoscopy in obese patients is a great chalenge, we devalopeq the \"Low Pressure Laparoscopy\" technique, it is a Laparoscopy in combinatioe with mechanical, abdonminal wan elevation by Endolift (Storzt), with Icy pressure, 5-9Cm, Co2 pneumopedtoneum.

This method can be applied to all upper and lower abdomen operatior~ -the way we operate on a daily basis. We have conducted ongoing experiments to reduce adhesion formation and improve results in a two layer laparoscopio intrapedtoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair of incisional and ventral hernia and have applied the results clinically. Laparoscopic repair offers advantages over open technique in operating and recovery time, visualization of the defect and low recurrence rate, but concerns remain about adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction. In prior experience we found onlay Gortex patch was unsatisfactor 7 because of slippage and adhesion formation in one out of 16 patients. We have developed a two layer technique using Butterfly Mesh in the defects and on top a wide propylene (Prolen). Animal experiments showed a way to protect the surface of the prolene to reduce adhesions. In four sets of animal experiments we compared incorportation and adhesion formation of Prolene alone, Prolena embedded in PDS and Prolene covered on its visceral surface with Surg~cel. Because of fewest adhesion, we subsequently selected the Composite of Prolene and Surgical for a second set of expenments in attempting to reduce the adhesions that formed predominantly at the edge of the mesh. We achieved this by overlapping the Surgical around the edge and by orienting the staples perpendioulady to and around the edges. In a final set of experiments, we found that wetting the Surgical with saline once the composite was in position, transformed it to a gelatinous film that further reduced adhesion. We applied the later experience in the repair of the incisional ventral hernias in 127 patients. The patients ages were 32-86 years, individual defects ranged from 3-22 cm, and with multiple defects, up to 35cm. Operating time was 0.75-2h with an average of 1.2h, Liquid diet was started at 8-10h. Only non-narcotics analgesic was needed with 1-3 doses per patlenL Patients were discharged on the 1 = to 3 ~ day and returned to normal activity between 3 to 7 days (average 5d). Five patients had significant abdominal pain which resoved at 3-5 weeks. One patient each developed a superficial umbilical infection (not on port site), small bowel fistula (from a repaired enterotomy), and three developed recurrence. Two patients were converted to open because of massive bowel adhesion. There have bean no intestinal obstructions after a ma)dmum of 61/= years follow-up. We experimentally perfected a technique of incisional/ventral hernia repair and designed a composite mesh of surgical and Prolene that produced the smallest amount of adhesions. We have successfully applied this IPOM two layers composite mesh repair in 127 patients with good results and low morbidity. Symptom resolution and fertility alter surgical management of Stage IV endometdosis requires exdsion of all endometnal deposits, including those involving the intestine. Data from open surgical sedes indicates that removal of intestinal disease requires bowel resection.

Bowel resection was only required in 10 cases: proctectomy (n=6);small bowel resection (n=2); ileocoecectomy (n=l); and rectal disc-excision (n=l). The mean LOS in resection cases was 6.2:1:1.5 days. Only 3/33 patients (9.1%) required abdominal hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Preoperatively, all patients had pelvic pain which resolved in 85 %. One colorectal anastomotic leak required a temporary laparoscopic loop ileostomy. Conversion was necessary in n = 3 patients. Even though technically demanding, radical laparoscopic excision with preservation of reproductive organs and limited use of bowel resection can be accomplished in the majodty of patients. Impo[tantiy, the need to resect bowel can be minimized, allowing limited hospitalization in most patients. The laparoscopic approach to Roux-Y gastric bypass is safe and effective, but the relative cost is unclear. Our aim was to compare hospital costs of patients undergoing open (OGB) or laparoscopic (LGB) gastric bypass. From 7/97 through 8/00, 129 patients with BMI of 37-64 underwent GB by a single surgeon at a teaching hospital, 65 OGB and 64 LGB. Outcome variables were length of stay (LOS), presence of postop complications, and inpatient costs (total, OR, room, pharmacy, supplies). Statistical compadsons were made with chi-square and ttest analysis after removing cost and LOS outliers (20GB, 1 LGB). The OGB cohort had a higher BMI (54 vs 48, OGB vs LGB), and lower fraction of women (73% vs 91%). Subgroup analysis by BMI decile and among women did not affect results. Cohorts did not differ in age (44y vs 43y) or comorbidity frequency: DM 28% vs 22%, HTN 48% vs 58%, Sleep apnea 52% vs 48%. LOS was shorter with LGB (5d vs 3d). There was one mortality at home on POD 8 from a PE (OGB). Morbidity was more frequent with OGB (53% vs 17%). Minor wound infection (25% vs 8%), incisional hernia (18% vs 3%), and stomal stenosis (15% vs 2%) were more common after OGB. Gastrograftin swallow in all patients between POD 4 and 9 showed one contained leak (LGB) in a patient after endoscopic treatment of an anastomotic bleed. One LGB patient developed a subphrenic abscess requiring percutaneous drainage on POD 15. Transfusion was more frequent in LGB (4% vs 10%). Conversion of LGP to OGP occurred in 2 cases (3%) due to splenic bleeding and a proximal jejunal injury. Percent loss of excess weight at 1 year was similar within BMI deciles (78% vs 88%). Total costs were greater with LGB ($10755 vs $11588). OR costs were higher in LGB (4089 vs 7878) due primarily to disposables and OR time. This more than offset lower costs in areas such as room (2189 vs 1168) and pharmacy (1481 vs 970). LGB achieves similar weight loss with shorter LOS, but OR and total costs are higher. Complications are less frequent but many occur in the outpatient setting and are not reflected in hospital costs.",

OBJECTIVE: We postulate that multiple, preformed, expandable pros. theses can be easily and accurately placed within the submucosal plan~ of the esophagus in pigs using a simple endoscopic delivery system METHODS: An endoscopic overtube system was developed for th~ delivery of multiple expandable prostheses. Adolescent pigs (n = 25) hac 2-15 prostheses placed into the distal esophageal wall using these steps 1) surveillance endoscopy, 2) passage of the overtube-endoscope sys tern, 3) stabilization of the delivery site, 4) saline expansion of the submu cosa, 5) prosthesis delivery, and 6) repeat steps 3-5 as necessary Sessions were video recorded. Animals had post-procedure endoscop~ at I week, 2 weeks, and at sacrifice. Successful delivery was ultimatel~ assessed by explant histopathology. RESULTS: Prosthesis insertior was successful in 92/94 delivery attempts, and required between 3-1. = minutes of effort per s~te. Five successfully-placed prostheses wer~ unavailable for followup because of immediate animal sacrifice. Using prototype system (n = 54): 44 prostheses remained safely within a sub mucosal location, 9 were lost at one week-presumably because o superficial sloughing-and, 1 was found deep to the muscular layer of the esophagus. A simple modification to the delivery system resulted in 100% retention at one week (n=33), and no instance of esophageal perforation No prosthesis was lost in any animal if endoscopically visible at 1 week Tissue explants revealed encapsulated and intact prostheses that were surrounded by chronic histiocytic fibrosis within the submucosa. Then was no sign of active inflammation or abscess formation. CONCLU SIONS: We have demonstrated that expandable prostheses can be eas ily and accurately delivered into the submucosal esophagus of pigs Multiple prostheses are well tolerated and retained without significant tis sue reaction. Future studies will attempt to assess 1) removability, and 2 prosthesis-induced changes in esophageal sphincter function. Cystic duct leaks have increased since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). An alternative technique for cystic duct and artery ligation was developed. The technique returned to the basic surgical tenet of ligation using suture ties with an occasional clip used when further security was deemed necessary by the operating surgeon. The purpose of this prospective review was to analyze cystic duct leaks, complications and costs compared to a standard LC using clips and disposible canulas.",

Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency and laparoscopic appendectomy has become a more popular procedure for treating this condition. Its use, however, has been questioned in cases of perforated and gangrenous appendicitis because of concems regarding the risk of intraabdominal infection. On the other hand, infection of the operative incision is the most common cause of morbidity after open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.",

The most common histopathologic diagnosis was tubulo-vil-Ious adenoma in 28 polyps followed by villous adenoma in 11 polyps. In three cases histopathologic diagnosis revealed malignancy necessitating segmental resection (1 low anterior resection, 2 right hemicolectomies), which were performed laparoscopically. Patients received a liquid diet within 6 hrs, were discharged in an average of 21 hours and retumed to full activity most commonly within days. The only complication presented in this group of patients was an umbilical port seroma. Virtually all patients (97%) behaved as if only a colonoscopy was performed. Pain at the trocar sites was managed with Acetaminophen 600mg P.O. as needed, CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic monitored colonoscopic polypectomy allows patients to undergo removal of colonic polyps without a segmental resection. This less invasive procedure yields recovery times similar to that of colonosoopy alone and, the potential complications of a segmental resection are avoided. All polyps are examined by frozen section and if a malignancy is encountered a laparoscopic resection can be performed. Obesity and prior abdominal surgery once excluded patients from laparoscopy because of complications related to pneumoperitoneum creation.

Methods.Two groups of ten female dogs (mean weight 20kg) underwent laparoscopic non-anatomic resection of approximately 500 of the total liver mass.Group I was evaluated for 48 hours postoperatively to assess for immediate postoperative complications.Group II was evaluated for 14 days postoperatively to assess for longer-term complications.At the end of the observation period, animals were euthanized.Low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (6mHg) was used.A variety of dissection and hemostatic techniques were employed including endoscopic stapling and bipolar electrocautery. Laparoscopic ultrasound was employed for major vessel identification.The liver specimen was extracted through an approximately 7-cm mcision and weighed. For Group II animals, a drain was placed to assess for postoperathe bile leak. Results.In group I, 3 animals developed a pneumothorax requiring premature euthanasia while the other 7 survived the 48 hours observation period.No significant pedoperattve bleeding occurred.The mean EBL was 66 ml.The mean postoperative Hct was 36%.1n group II, the mean EBL was 70 mI.The mean postoperative Hct remained stable between 35% (POD1) and 37.5% (POD10).Mean glucose (mg%) remained stable between 118 and 130 at 1 and 5 days.One biliary leak at a resection site was confirmed (10%).Total Bilirubin remained in normal range in all animals except two (one associated with a bile leak the other unknown cause).Mean GOT (UI/L) and GPT (UI/L) peaked at 1675 and 1279 respectively but retumed to near normal levels by POD 10.There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism in either group. Conclusion.Laparoscopic non-anatomic hepatectomy in a canine model is feasible with minimal perioperatlve bleeding and a relatively low rate of bile leak using currently available dissectnon and hemostasis techniques.The canine model appears to be helpful in evaluating resection methods prior to use in humans despite anatomic differences with human liver anatomy.",

This study describes our experience with bowel obstruction following the laparoscopic approach to Gastric bypass. Methods. We reviewed our experience with postoperative bowel obstruction in 405 patients who underwent LRYGBP between July 1997 and August 2000. Results. Eight patients in the series (2%) developed a postoperative bowel obstruction requiring operative management. Their mean BMI was 46 (range: 38-65) and the average age was 45 (range: 29-56). Five occurred in the early postoperative period and 3 occurred late (> 3 months). Internal hernias through mesenteric defects (4) were the most common cause followed by obstruction at the entero-enterostomy (3), and adhesions (1). In 6 patients the obstruction was managed laparoscopically (1 conversion) and two patients underwent exploratory laparotomy. In all cases the obstructions were successfully managed without requiring bowel resection. In two cases the entero-enterostomy required revision. All patients recovered uneventfully, except for one patient who eventually succumbed to a pulmonary embolus. Conclusion. Internal hernias appear to be a significant cause of bowel obstructions after laparoscopic gastric bypass. They develop because bowel herniates through mesenteric defects resulting from creation of the Roux-limb. Secure, suture closure of these defects should be performed before completing the operation in order to prevent intemal hernias and subsequent bowel obstruction. Laparoscopic-assisted colectomy has been common in the treatment for colon cancer. However, it can be difficult -especially for advanced colon cancer to perform lymph node dissection including regional blood vessels (D3 dissection)via laparoscopy. There are three main approaches to D3 dissection: lateral, medial, and retroperitoneal. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the appropriate approach to perform D3 dissection. We chose the medial approach with early retroperitoneal mobilization from medial to lateral ( medial retroperitoneal approach ; MRA). The advantages of MRA are the ease and safety of mobilizing the mesecolon from the retroperitoneum, the ease of utilizing the rotation technique for D3 lymph node dissection and its consonance with the no touch isolation technique.",

Acquiring the sldils for laparnscopic suturing and knotting techniques can be a considered a prerequisite to learning advanced laparoscopic procedures. Although disposable mechanical devices are available to simplify the tissue approximation task for surgeons, their use is associated with higher operating costs, and they are not universally applicable. The purpose of our study was to evaluate and compare in the acquisition of intracorporeal knot tying techniques using reusable instruments in two groups of surgeons. The skills of 17 specialists and 12 residents, ranging in age from 26-57 years of age, were compared. Hands-on training workshops on advanced laparoscopic procedures were conducting, ranging from 1.5 to 2 days (15-20 hours) in length. After each surgeon had practiced the knordng techniques three times, their performance limes were measured for tying a simple fiat knot; the number of erroneous movements were also noted and evaluated. The average time for creating a fiat knot d~fered significantly in the group of specialists who had an average performance time of 58.8 seconds (range of 7-100 seconds), whereas the residents group averaged 15 seconds (range of 6-29 seconds). The mean number of erroneous movements corresponded to the average performance lime: 3.4 (0-9) in the group of specialists and 1.08 (0-3) in the resident's group. Following the first round of evaluations, the participants continued to practice their slu'lis. On the second day, creating a complete knot (simple square knot, with a third opposing fiat knot) was the next task. The average performance time for the specialists was 178.8 seconds (range of 65-230 seconds) and in the resident's group: 143.5 seconds (range of 97-205 seconds). The mean number of erroneous movements were similar in both groups: 5 (0-9) and 4.9 (2-12) respectively. The authors conclude that the acquisition of laparoscopic instracorporeol knot tying techniques is dependent on practice rather than whether the surgeon is in training or not. Percutaneous transhepatic intervention with or without endoscopic management is not universally available in developing countries to treat patients suffering from obstructive jaundice. We report the experience at a rural hospital in Argentina, using a minimally-invasive approach to provide adequate long term biliary drainage using several types of biliary-enteric bypass procedures.",

            "text": "Laparoscopic biliary-enteric bypass is an alternative and feasible approach to provide an adequate drainage of the biliary system when percutaneous and/or endoscopic techniques are not available. When applied to debilitated patients carrying a malignant disease, the psychological burden of carrying an external drainage with its side effects can be spared. Objective: Gastric remnant oarcinoma (GRC) after resection for peptic ulcer disease is an uncommon entity that is potentially cured by surgical intervention. A recent case of advanced GRC prompted a review of the role of screening endoscopy in this population. Case: A 67-year-old male presented with complaints of chronic postprandial pain in the epigastric region. The patient had undergone a vagotomy, antrectomy, and loop gastrojejunostomy for peptic ulcer disease 25 years prior. Abdominal CT revealed markedly thickened walls of the gastric remnant with infiltration of the adjacent fat planes. An esophagogastroscopy demonstrated erythematous, friable remnant mucosa. Gastric biopsies revealed invasive adenocarcinoma. At laparotomy a large tumor mass involving the gastric remnant and the antecolic loop gastrojejunostomy was identified. Further exploration revealed a firm nodule in the left lobe of the liver and several small nodules on the diaphragm and the lesser omentum. Biopsies confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma at all sites. Curative resection was abandoned. Discussion: GRC typically presents more than 20 years after the initial gastric procedure and has a history of poor survival rates. With increased use of diagnostic endoscopy, GRC has been detected at earlier stages. Recent cohort studies demonstrate that GRC has similar survival rates after stage stratification when compared with primary proximal gastric carcinoma. The incidence ratio of GRC in patients with resection for benign disease increases from 1.4 for the 5-20 year postoperative interval to 3.9 from 21-40 years and finally to 7.3 from 40-45 years after surgery. Conclusion: The increased incidence of GRC in later decades (>20 years) after operation in conjunction with decreasing numbers of patients suggests that screening endoscopy should be considered on a 2-5 year basis in this population. Furthermore, any endoscopy undertaken in postgastrectomy patients should include biopsy of the gastric remnant because early GRC can often have a normal mucosal surface appear Recently biliary endoprostheses assumed significant role in palliation of obstructive jaundice in pancreatic cancer patients. ERCP and PTC being the usual mutes, we present a novel and effective approach for this unfortunate group in the event of failure with using these traditional methods.

Early postoperative small bowel obstruction (EPSBO) occurs in nearly 1% of patients undergoing laparotomy and has a mortality rate exceeding 17%. Nasogastric (NG) decompression is successful in 78% of patients. Repeat laparotomy has been recommended when obstruction does not resolve after 14 days of NG decompression. We report 4 patients with EPSBO treated successfully with push enteroscopy after failed NG decompression. Methods: Four patients who failed NG decompression underwent push enteroscopy instead of repeat laparotomy. EPSBO was diagnosed if obstruction lasting more than 14 days developed after initial resolution of postoperative ileus or high NG output persisted for 21 days in the absence of prolonged ileus or sepsis. Small bowel series or CT was utilized when radiographic assessment was necessary. The Olympus SIF 100 push enteroscope was introduced with an overtube using topical anesthesia and intravenous sedation. After maximal insertion, the enteroscope was withdrawn without evacuation of insufflated air. NG tubes were placed after enteroscopy and the patients followed clinically. Flatus, defecation, and tolerance of diet defined resolution of EPSBO. Results: EPSBO resolved 24-36 hours following enteroscopy and all patients were discharged on general diets 48 hours after return of bowel function. Readmission has not been necessary during 12-24 month follow-up. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that push enteroscopy is successful in treating EPSBO and should be considered prior to re-operation. Repeat laparotomy may not be necessary and push enteroscopy may reduce patient morbidity, cost, and hospital lengths of stay associated with this uncommon surgical complication.

Additional ports for retraction were used as needed once injuries were identified. Therapeutic procedures consisted of sutudng an intrapedtoneal bladder rupture, draining of a lacerated tail of the pancreas, and obtaining hemostasis of an actively bleeding penetrating wound to the left lobe and caudate lobe of the liver. All patients experienced a prompt and uncomplicated recovery with no missed injudes and a mean hospital stay of 3.3 days.",

Introduction: Conservative treatment of the ulCer disease is not so effective in Ukraine like in Western Europe due to social and economical situations. Operative treatment of duodenal ulcer disease is still economically feasible in Eastem Europe. Methods and procedures: Laparoscopic operation were performed in 149 patients for management of complicated peptic duodenal ulcer disease. Indications for operation were: bleeding in 97 patients, perforation in 36 patients, stenosis in 8 patients. In patients with bleeding, vagotomy was performed after successful endoscopic hemostasis. Taylors procedure -posterior trunk vagotomy and anterior seromyotomy was performed in 82 patients. In 69 patients anterior seromyotomy was performed by contact Nd-YAG laser, which was more effective than seromyotomy by scissors. In 15 patients Gomez-Ferrer procedure -postedor trunk vagotomy and resec~on of the lesser curve by stapler was performed. In 36 cases with perforation, 19 patients were operated by intracorporal suturing of the perforated ulcer, 9 patients by omental patch to the perforation defect. Taylor's vagotomy and sutudng of the ulcer defect was performed in 8 cases. In category of patients with stenosis, 4 patients were operated by bilateral posterior truncal vagotomy with gestroenterostomy. In 3 cases we performed Taylor's vagotomy and pyloroduodenoplasty.

This delay persists even on the postoperative 10th day in rectum anastomosis but not in the ascending colon anastomosis. Anastomosis at diferent sites on the colon causes different gastric emptying rates. Pathogenesis of postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation is still being a subject of investigation. Local peritoneal ischemia is one of the factors that is responsible for the postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation. The current study was planned to investigate the role of ET-1 as a potent vasoconstrictor agent in the local peritoneal ischemia and subsequent peritoneal adhesion formation. 28 Adult Wistar Albino rats weighed 200-230 g were divided to four groups. Control group (Group-I; n=7) did not undergo an operation. In adhesion group (Group-2; n=7),1x1 cm peritoneal patch excision from the right abdominal wall and caecal abrasion were done as the\"adhesion model operation\". Sham group (Group-3; n=7) had only laparatomy. After \"adhesion model operation\" treatment group (Group-A; n=7) received a non-selective ET-1 receptor blocker Bosenthan (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, once a day for five days. Intestinal blood flow through the superior mesenteric artery was measured by doppler ultrasound, at postoperative tenth day. Adhesion scores of the groups were calculated. Mean intestinal blood flow was significantly increased in adhesion group (81.9+-5.6 ml/100g) when compared to Group-1 (65.5+-1.2 ml/100g). Bosenthan caused a significant decrease (44.3+-6.9 ml/100g) in intestinal blood flow when compared to group-1 and 2. Sham group (62.2+-1ml/100g) had similar blood flow level with the control group (65.5+-1.2 ml/100g). Adhesion scores were similar in adhesion and besenthan groups. Sham group had nearly no adhesion. Non-selective blockade of ET-1 has no effect on intraperitoneal adhesion formation. Adhesion formation increases the intestinal blood flow. Chronic intraperitoneal ETA and ETB receptor blockade causes a decrease in the blood flow of adhesion formed intestinal tissue. Colorectal distension that can be occurred in many surgical climcal situations may affect the gastric motility. Gastric emptying rate is an important measure in the evaluation of gastric motility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different modes of rectal distension and estrogen on gastric emptying rate. 32 Male 200-250 g weighed Wistar-AIbino rats were divided to three groups. Group-1 (n=8) subjected to gastric emptying test without undergoing any operation. Group-2 (n=8) has been applied to painless colorectal distension for one hour. Group-3 (n=8) subjected to painfull colorectal distension for one hour. Group-4 (n=8) has been pretreated with 17 beta estradiol benzoate (20 microgram/kg/day s.c.) for five days before painful rectal distension. Colorectal distension has been created by indwellig a number six foley catheter through the rectum 2 cm above the anal verge. Pain stimuli was determined according to electromyographic measurement from the abdominal muscles. Gastric emptying test has been performed by the methyl cellulose phenol red method. Gastric emptying rate was found 72.1+-3.5 % in Group-1. Colorectal distension decreased the gastric emptying rate to 62.6+-3.5 % (n.q.s) while the painfull colorectal distension caused a more decrease in gastric empying rate 48+-6.3 % (p<0.01). Group-4 gastric emptying rate increased even above control levels (80.5+-4.9 %). Painful rectal distension causes significant inhibition of gastric emptying rate. This inhibition can be reversed by estrogen therapy. Although passing a large esophageal dilator is a safe technique in open fundoplication, the same may not be assumed for the laparoscopic operation, since the lower esophagus is unsupported during per oral insertion of the dilator. latrogenic perforation occurs in as high as 3%. We tested the hypothesis that good fundoptication can be performed without a dilator in a consecutive series of 35 patients (Group I), using simple precautionary measures, such as routinely visualizing a 0.5-1 an space between the fundic wrap and ~'e esophagus upoil lifting the wrap. The results, compared with a consecutive series of bougie-assisted wrap (group II), were similar, the follow-up being 100% in both: Objective: Technical skills of residents have traditionally been evaluated using subjective In-Training Evaluation Reports (ITERs). An objective model for assessment of fundamental laparoscopic skills has been developed (FLS).

In addition to the duodenal resections, 2 cholecystectomies with cholangiogram (to assess the ampulla following resection) and a Nissen fundoplication were performed. Average hospital stay was 4.4 days (3-7 days). There were no complications and no deaths. With an average of 6 months of follow-up, there has been no documented recurrence or complication. Laparoscopic resection of duodenal tumors is safe and feasible. Endoscopic-assistance is extremely helpful to localize the tumor and determine its relationship to the ampulla. Even when open resection is required, laparoscopic assistance can limit the laparotomy incision. One hundred and fourteen esophageal cancer cases have undergone thoracoscopic and/or laparoscopic surgery for these 5 years in our institutional hospitals. Noting cases since 1997 when a laparoscopic technique for the abdominal procedure was introduced, we have performed 34 open surgery, 26 thoracoscopic and laparoscopic (TL Group), 28 thoracoscopic and laparotomy (T Group), and 24 laparoscopic and thoracotomy (L Group) surgery for this disease, meaning recent increase of the laparoscopic cases. Above 3 thoracoscopic and/or laparoscopic groups were compared with 80 conventional open surgery cases (C Group) which were performed before introduction of the thoracoecopic technique. Results: The 3 major complications after surgery, pulmonary troubles, anastomotic insufficiency, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, were 7%, 4%, and 24% respectively in TL group, 23%, 5%, and 23% respectively in T group, 8%, 0%, and 12% respectively in L group, and 16%, 3%, and 16% respectively in C group. This summarized that the recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy is higher in the thoracoscopic surgery than in thoracotomy procedure and that the pulmonary troubles are lower in the laparoscopic surgery than in laparotomy procedure. Mean number of nodes dissected, mean duration of the operation, and mean blood loss were not differ among those 4 groups. As far as postoperative respiratory function was concerned, the reduction of percentage of the vital capacity was lower in the T group than in thoracotomy cases, resulting a better tolerance of the exercise. Conclusion: Although the laparoscopic and thoracotomy surgery' was the best procedure among these groups in terms of the postoperative complications, distant respiratory function was the most maintained in the T group. This implied that if the ratio of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy had been reduced the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic surgery would be the best procedure for the esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of performing longitudinal choledochotomy and repair with ZEUS robotic technology.",

ZEUS group:leak-2, back wall injury-2. Condusion: ZEUS robotic assisted longitudinal choledochotomy and repair is technically feas~le. Significant differences in anesthesia and anastomosis times likely represent the learning curve, since current anastomotic times are 70-90 minutes for a robotic end-to-end anastomosis. Set-up times are inherently longer for ZEUS. Additionally, back wall injuries in the ZEUS group were eliminated once scissors were used instead of a scalpel. The highly signiticant difference in complication rates markedly favors robotic assistance. Survivor studies are needed to further validate these results. Nonetheless, ZEUS robotic technology offers the promise of expanding applications in advanced iaparoscopic surgery. Robotic assisted surgery is projected to accelerate the learning curve for advanced laparoscopic surgery, but little data exists to support this contention. This study tested the hypothesis that novice surgeons would learn advanced laparoscopic skills more quickly using a robotic assisted surgical system than using conventional two-handed laparoscopic surgical techniques. Twelve surgical residents (PGY1 -PGY5) participated in the initial study. Each resident was given a brief orientation to the DaVinci(tm) Surgical System and was given standardized instructions to perform 2 simple two-handed laparoscopic tasks. Task 1 was transferring 10 lifesavers out of a box onto a nail using the non-dominant hand while holding a 30-degree camera with the dominant hand. Task 2 was passing a needle through 9 keyhole pins placed in an S pattern. Each resident was given 5 minutes to practice these tasks with both standard laparoscopic needle drivers and with the DaVinci (tm) Surgical System. After the practice session, each subject performed these tasks using the robot and using conventional two-handed laparoscopic technique. Subjects were scored using a standardized assessment tool based on accuracy and time.",

Results for Task I showed no significant difference in time or accuracy (13< 0.05). The number of residents completing Task 2 was significantly higher using the robot (9/12) versus using conventional two-handed lapamscopic technique (2/12)(p <0.001). Accuracy was also significan~ improved on Task 2 when the robot was used. We conclude that for learning speed and accuracy of simple surgical tasks, robotic surgical assistance is at least as good as conventional laparoscopic techniques. However, for complex tasks, both speed and accuracy are enhanced by the DaVinci(tm) Surgical System. These findings suggest that robotic surgery will accelerate the learning and performance curve for advanced laparoscopic skills. Background: Although the liver is the most frequent site of recurrence after conventional open surgery for colorectal cancer, the effect of laparoscopic procedures with or without gas insufflation on the development of liver metastases is largely unknown. Methods: Male BALB/C mice inoculated intraportally with colon 26 cells were randomized to undergo CO2 pneumoperitoneum (n=14), abdominal wall lifting (n=14), full laparotomy (n=12), or to serve as controls without any procedures other than tumor inoculation (n=13). Results: The growth of liver metastases 14 days after surgery was enhanced following full laparotomy (P<0.01) and pneumoperitoneum (P<0.01) as compared with that in the control, while there was no difference in the growth of liver metastases between abdominal wall lifting and the control (P=0.99). Conclusions: These results suggest that the defense against liver metastasis is better preserved following the gasless procedure than following laparotomy and CO2 pneumoperitoneum in this animal model.

Total adrenalectomy performed laparoscopically may become the standard for the treatment of benign adrenal tumors. On the other hand, partial adrenalectomy is infrequently performed, reserved for the patient cohort at risk for iatrogenic Addison's disease were total adrenalectomy to be carried out.This includes patients with a single adrenal gland, bilateral disease and the multiple endocrine neoplastic syndromes. We recently treated a patient by partial adrenalectomy in order to preserve paired organs, an indication we believe to be appropriate in a young person. This type of operation can be performed effectively, safely and indeed was easier than total resection. Laparoscopy affords superior visualization of anatomy. Mobilization and dissection of the adrenal is facilitated by the delicate laparoscopic instruments that reach deep into the recesses of the retroperitoneum. Clearly long term followup studies are necessary, but we believe that adrenal preserving procedures deserve serious consideration in selected cases. (A two minute video accompanies the presentation). Omental Transposition is a recognized but infrequently employed procedure for providing vascularized tissue to heal infected sites, improve the milieu for poorly vascularized tissue or to provide coverage for an exposed prosthesis. The challange of chronically non healing wounds in two elderly patients form the basis of this report. In both cases, the omentum was harvested laparoscopically and used in one instance as an omental pedicle flap to cover an infected stemal wound. In another patient, the omentum was used as a free flap to cover a large pretibial, post radiation wound. This procedure required microvascular technique. The wounds in both patients healed within few weeks with full skin coverage. The omentum can be harvested laparoscopically by dividing its attachment to the greater curvature of the stomach with an harmonic scalpel, care being taken to avoid injury to the gastroepiploic arcade. Detachmment from the spleen is performed with relative ease including separation from the abdominal wall and colon. The free flap method requires dissection of the gastroepiploic vessels as they originate from the posterior gastroduodenal vessel. Division at this level enables the subsequent anastomosis to the donor vessels. Laparoscopic harvesting of the omentum is technically nondemanding and minimally traumatic. It obviates the need for laparotomy and espeQally the need for complicated muscle flaps that are associated with significant morbidities, S134 ENDOSCOPIC THYROIDECTOMY: PATIENT SELECTION, TECH-NIQUE, AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS William B Inabnet, Ill, MD and Michel Gagner, MD, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York NY Objectives: Conventional thyroidectomy is performed through a cervical incision, necessitating myocutaneous flaps to gain access to the thyroid gland.

The clinical picture of chronic vascular compression of the third portion of the duodenum usually presents with intermittent fullness and bloating after meals, vomiting, and weight loss. Conservative treatment includes nasogastric tube decompression, prokinetic agents, and postprandial positioning. If these fall, the operation of choice is duodenojejunostomy. Laparosoopic duodenojejunostomy for SMA syndrome was first described by Gersin and Heniford in 1998. We report a case of SMA syndrome treated definitively by laparosoopic duodenojejunostomy and provide medium-term (one year) fellow-up. PROCEDURE: The patient, a thin 31-year-old male diagnosed with SMA syndrome, had failed medical management. He was prepared for surgery. A stapled side-to-side duedenojejunostomy was created to the third portion of the duodenum through the transverse meseoolon using three five millimeter and one twelve millimeter ports. RESULTS: The patient was discharged home four days postoperatively eating and drinking without pain. He subsequently had a weight gain from 50kg to 62kg over the next several months; however, he continued to have intermittent periumbilical pain, which he desoribes as \"50%\" of the preoperative level. A gastrcecopy performed at about nine months postoperatively showed a new diagnosis (not seen on preoperative gastroscopy)of Barrett's esophagus confirmed by biopsy. The gastrosoopy showed the anastomosis to be widely patent. He has been provided some further relief of symptoms with the addition of a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy provides a minimally invasive surgical altemative to the patient, while not sacrificing the technique of the original open procedure. The procedure can provide symptomatic relief, but long-term follow-up is crucial for this difficult set of patients. In our clinic we developed a technique of performing videothoracoscopic parastemal lymphadenectomy (VTS PLAE). The operation is fulfilled through the use of general anesthesia with the separate intubation ot bronchi. With the appropriate surgery performed on the mammary land and axillary collector 3 thoracoports are introdeuced into the pleural cavit~ in the following way: along the medioolavicular and medioaxial lines in th~ 5th intercostal space and along the anterior axillary line in 4th intercosta space. Pulmonary ventilation is dis-connected from the operation side thoracoscope and manipulators are introduced into the pleural cavity. Th~ parietal pleura is dissected in parallel with intemai vessels using electr~ surgical retractor (from the level of the 1st inter-costal space down to th~ 4th intercostal space). After mobilization the internal breast vessels ar~ clipped and resected, the fat with lymph nodes are sepa-rated and th( preparation is removed. The pleural cavity is drained up to 2 days. 20 cadavers were used to study the adequacy of VTS PLAE volume Simultaneously VTS PLAE from one side and a traditional (open) lyn phade-nectomy from the other side were performed followed by the exam ination of lymph nodes number. In the course of the experiment with car davers histologi-cal assay of the preparation removed the average num ber of parastemal lymph nodes was 2.5+-0,56 and 2,3+-0,3) by VT, r PLAE and traditional (open) method, respectively (P>0,1).

Giant hernias with a loss of intra-abdominai domain are infrequently encountered. However, the incidence may be increasing because of immigration from areas of the world with fewer medical resources. Successful management of these difficult hernias require awareness of potential complications and management options. Three uniquely different cases of giant hernia are presented. Case 1 was a 60 year old white man with a longstanding giant inguinoscrotal hernia who presented with signs of partial bowel obstruction. Pneumoperitoneum was established with a single lumen catheter to a pressure of 15 to 20 mm Hg for two weeks in order to re-establish intraabdominal domain prior to hernia repair. Repair was then accomplished through a groin incision after omentectomy. His preoperative course was complicated by pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation and vena cava filter. Case 2 was a 70 year old Russian female who presented with a complete bowel obstruction seoonoary to a giant incisional hernia. Loss of domain was managed with a midline incision and a large madex mesh placed without tension to span the gap between fascial edges. Despite this, the patient developed abdominal compartment syndrome requiring ventilator support for two weeks. Case 3 was a 60 year old Indian female with a longstanding giant incisionai hernia and intermittent bowel obstruction. Loss of domain was managed at surgery with a long midline incision and construction of a temporary silo using the patients redundant skin. The patients postoperative course was uncomplicated and hernia repair was successfully completed several weeks later when intra-abdominal domain was reestablished by the pressure created by the silo.",

Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients awaiting liver transplant (OL'r). Background: Control of tumor growth while waiting for OLT is ~ly important for patients with HCC. MCT is an ablabve therapy developed in Japan. For more than a decade it has been used routinely in the management of HCC. We applied this technology to OLT candidates with localized HCC. This is a preliminary report of the first US trial of MCT. Patients and Methods: A microwave generator (Microtaze| AZWELL.Inc, Osaka, Japan) with specialized probes (16G-22G needle) was used in the study. Seventeen OLT candidates have been enrolled in the study (mean age 56.2 years). All patients were cirrhotic secondary to hepatitis C (n=12), hepatitis B (n---3), and cryptogenic (n=2). Their Child's scores were:Child A (n=7), B (n=9), and C (n=l). 15 patients had a single lesion and two had more than one lesion. The size of the largest tumor ranged from 1.5cm to 5.0crn (median 4.0cm). All were deemed unresectable due to tumor location and/or the severity of the hepatic dysfunction. Results: Nineteen MCT ablations were performed either laparoscopically (n=12) or percutaneously with ultrasound guidance (n=5) or CT guidance (n=2). Simultaneous laparoscopic choleoysteotomy was performed in two patients with tumors adjacent to the gall bladder. Hand-assisted laparoscopy was used in two cases for exposure. Tumor ablation was assessed by helical CT with IV contrast. All twelve patients with elevated AFP pdor to the MCT expadenced a decrease (mean value decreased from 1048 to 205ng/ml). Nine patients have received OLT. Complete tumor ablation was confirmed in the explanted livers. Two have died post-transplant of causes unrelated to HCC. Neither had evidence of tumor recurrence. The other 7 patients are alive and tumor free at 1-18 months after the OLT. Eight patients are waiting for OLT 1-19 months after MCT. Conclusions: This preliminary experience suggests that MCT may control HCC progression in patients awaiting OLT. Laparoecopic donor nephrectomy has been ut~zed in Univel~y Hospitals with excellent results. The purpose of ~ study was to critically analyze our results Ioparcecopic donor nephreotomy done at a community hospital with a busy transplant center.",

The purpose of this study was to critically analyze our results with laparoscopic lymphocele drainage at a community hospital with a busy transplant center. Significance of any changes was tested using Student's t-test with independent variables Between March 1993 and August 1999 we did 852renal transplants and 113 of these developed symptoma~c lymphoceles requiring operative drainage (13.7%). Laparoscopic drainage was attempted in 39 and was suocessful in 29 cases. Even though we were still in the early learning period of doing laparoscopic lymphoceh drainage our patients had a better cosmetic result, lost less blood and were discharged home sooner. Though laparoscopic skills are required our data suggests that with adequate training community hospitals with busy transplant centers may be able to offer this procedure. Laparoscopic drainage of lymphoceh results in minimal disability and acceptable complication rates. Therefore laparnscopic drainage should be considered as primary treatment for all patients with symptomatic post-transplant lymphoceles even in community centers. RESULT: Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 1 case of laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy, 8 cases of cholecystectomy, 1 case of surgery for the transverse colon cancer, 1 case of left hemicolectomy, 5 cases of low anterior resection, 5 case of colostomy. The surgical mean time was required 176 minutes(60-402). The average of serum Cre was 4.01mg/dl, BUN was 28mg/dl and K was 4.01mEq/l.

Introduction. Although safety and technical feasibility of laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia (VIH) repair with a PTFE mesh have been documented, difficulty handling and high cost are among the drawbacks of PTFE grafts. Polypropylene (PP) mesh is less costly and easier to handle laparoscopicaly, but the fear of adhesions restricts its use.

            "text": "ACHALASIA FOLLOWING FUNDOPLICATION Leana Khaitan, MD, Jonathan A. Cohen, MD, William O. Richards, MD Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, \"IN Backqround: Achalasia is a motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by esophageal apadstaisis and non-relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. It is unclear whether achalasia may develop secondary to a funddonal distal obstruction such as a tight fundoplicetion (FP), or whether the FP may unmask undiagnosed achalasia. Materials and Methods: Four patients who had previously undergone Niesen fundoplication were referred to our institution for evaluation of severe dysphagia and a diagnosis of secondary achalasia. Only one patient had undergone preoperative manometry, which revealed normal peristalsis. The remaining three patients had undergone fundoplication based upon symptoms and esophagram alone. Three of the patients had had multiple previous lower esophageal procedures. After developing dysphagia, all undenvent esophagram and upper endoscopy. Three patients then underwent reversal of the Nissen FP and reconstruction with a Toupet FP. Results: All four patients had low amplitude (~=33.5 mmHg), apedstaltic contractions with a nnn-relaxing, norm=l amplitude LES (~= 21 5 mmHg). Barium esophagram and endoscopy were consistent with achalasia. Intraoparetive findings in the three patients who unden~ent takedown of the FP and revision to a Toupet FP were noted to have a wrap 9 2 cm in length or one that was too tight. While these 3 patients experienced relief immediately after surgery, all of the 3 patients have developed recurrent dysphagia months later. One of these patients continues to undergo dilations and another has since had the Toupat FP taken down. Conclusions: Achalasia discovered following FP is a clinical conundrum. Such cases confirm the recommendation for routine preoperative esophageal manomaW. These cases also highlight the technical considerations of FP, including division of all the short gastric vessels, performing the wrap over a large bougie, and creating a short, loose wrap. Our exparience indicates that repeat dilations and FP revision may be inadequate therapy. Complete takedown of the FP and anti-acid medication may be a durable option in treating these patients with findings of achalesia after fundoplica~n. Repeated operative treatment of these patients exacerbates adhesion formation following each procedure. Seprafilm (Germ/me, Tucker, GA), a bioresorbable membrane, has been shown to significantly decrease postoperative adhesion formation. We reviewed our experience with laparoscopic adhesiolysis and Seprafilm placement in this difficult population. Materials and Methods: Nine consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic adhesiolysis and placement of Seprafilm for chronic abdominal pain secondary to adhesions between July 1, 1998 and July 30, 2000. There were 8 females and 1 male. Patients had previously undergone an average of 5.2 abdominal procedures, of which 2 were for lysis of adhesions. All patients suffered from intractable abdominal pain for at least 4 months prior to procedure. Five patients had radiographic evidence of, or previous admission for bowel obstruction. Results: Two patients were converted to an open procedure due to very dense adhesions. Eight of the nine patients report excellent results (off all narcotic pain medications) from their procedure at an average of 9.4 month follow-up. The one complication occurred in a patient who was converted to an open procedure. This patient's postoperative course was complicated by an abdominal abscess and an enterocutanaous ~tule. She remains on narcotics for abdominal pain. All other patients report complete resolution of their preoperative abdominal pain. Most patients report that their pain resolved almost immediately post-operatively allowing early resumption of activities of daily living. Average hospital stay was 2 days for all patients. Those who had a completely laparoscopic procedure were hospitalized for less than one day. Conclusion: Patients who suffer from chronic, intractable abdominal pain as a result of adhesions from previous abdominal procedures benefit from a combination of meticulous laparoscopic adhesiolysis and placement of Seprafilm. This approach provides excellent relief of pain and interrupts the cycle of repeated operative procedures to lyse adhesions. Achalasia, though a rare disease, represents significant patient morbidity. A validated reproducible animal model is necessary to investigate the etiology and potential treatments of the disease for humans. Previous animal models of achaiasia have not been completely validated using all of the manometric, radiographic and histopathologic cdteda established for achalasia. We present definitive validation of an animal achalssia model with manometric, radiographic and histopathologic criteria.",

This model will be useful for investigating the etiology and potential treatments of achelasia in human beings. Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that laparoscopic CO2insufflation reduces macro-and microperfusion in splanchnic organs and portal venous blood flow (PBF). Doparnine was found to increase PBF by preportal vasodilatation and endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor blockade might diminishing PBF by ET-1 dependant portal venous vasoconstriction. The current study investigates changes on portal venous blood flow during CO2-1aparoscopy using different intraabdominal pressures and application of different vasodilatatoric agents. 15 male WAG/Rij rats were randomized into 3 groups to obtain CO2laparoscopy and low-dose doparnine infusion (n---5), selective ET-l-antagonist (JKC 302) infusion (n--5) or sodium chlodd infusion as control (n--5). A PE-50 cannula was inserted into the intemal jugular veine for drug apply and a Doppler ultrasound probe was placed around the portal vein. Following an equilibration time of 30min PBF was measured during lAP of 2mmHg, 4mmHg, 6rnmHg, 8mmHg, 10mmHg and 12mmHg. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn and Holm test. Increased lAP lead to a linear decrease of portal venous blood flow (PBF) in the sodium chlorid control group. The application of ET-l-antagonist (JKC 302) and low-dose dopamine infusion significantly improved PBF when compared to sodium chlorid controls (p<0.05). No significant differences were found comparing PBF during ET-1 and dopemine application (p>0.05). Pharmacological vasodilatation of the splanchnic organs restores portal venous blood flow (PBF) reduction during laparoscopic CO2-insufflation whereas sodium infusion shows no effect. Whether improved hepatic perfusion may have beneficial effects on the liver function needs further investigation. Recent clinical and experimental data propose laparoscopic CO2-insufflation to enhance proliferation and metastatic potential of different gastrointestinal tumor cell lines. But the pathophysiological mechanisms for these findings are still unknown. E-Cadherin, I-CAM1, I-CAM2 and CD44 are cell surface molecules, which are involved in the metastatic process, invasivness and behaviour of different tumor cell lines. Therefore the aim of the current study was to analyze the influence of CO2-exposure on the expression of tumor-associated cell adhesion molecules of different cultured tumor cells. Two colon cancer cell lines, CX-2 (human colon carcinoma, n=80) and CC-531 (rat colon carcinoma, n=30) were exposed for 60 rain to a CO2-environment at 6 mmHg. Control groups were exposed 60 min to room air. The expression of E-Cadherin, I-CAM1, I-CAM2 and CD44 was measured directly, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after CO2-exposure by flow-cytometry. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney u-test. Expression of E-Cadhefin significantly decreased, while expression of I-CAM1, I-CAM2 and CD44 significantly increased after exposure to CO2-insuffiation, when compared to room air controls (p<0.05). The current study demonstrates CO2-exposure to alter the expression of tumor-associated molecules in cultured colorectal cancer cells. Whether decreased E-Cadherin expression and increased I-CAM1, I-CAM2 and CD44 expression due to CO2insufflation might promote the metastatic potential of colorectal malignancies in-vivo needs further investigations.

For these nodes, size of greater than 1 cm should not be used as a criterion for malignancy. The cosmetic result is one argument in favor of laparoscopic over open appendectomy. To further improve that cosmetic result we developed a laparoscopic access to the abdominal cavity through two suprapubic incisions placed in the line of the pubic hair. Patients: We compared operative characteristic, outcome and patient preference of three different accesses to the abdominal cavity for laparoscopic appendectomy in a retrospective study. Furthermore 24 healthy female persons were asked about their preferred procedure in regaKI to the cosmetic result. Results: Between 111997 and 08/2000, 149 patients underwent laparoscepic appendectomy and were assigned to either one technique (see fig. 1 ).

            "text": "METHOD: In our center, we perform the open prepedtoneal operation popularized by Stoppa initially, on one side only to familiarize the surgeon with the anatomy of the pre-peritoneal space. All the anatomical landmarks are to be noted carefully. A minimum of 10 such operations would be required to enable the surgeon with better insight into this anatomy.The same procedure is then to be repeated in the laparoscopic operation. We have found the learning curve far less steep as the anatomy is now very familiar. In case of bleeding or excessive pneumopedtoneum, the procedure should be converted to open Stoppa operation, which the laparoscopic surgeon performs in open surgery, rather than TAPP. This enables the complication to be identified and noted for future. We feel that this practice would make the learning curve for laparescopic TEP less steep and also decrease the incidence of initial complications. It would also give added confidence in dealing with structures in this space where the anatomy has an \"inside out view\" which the surgeon now finds much more familiar, having routinely performed the \"open equivalent\" of the same operation.

Introduction: The anatomic distortion and technical difficulty inherent with repair of giant paraeeophageal hemiation have limited the use of laparoscopic approaches for the correction of these disorders. Materials and Methods: Since 5/1994, we have performed laparoscopic repair of paraesophageal hiatal hemias in 94 patients. Mean age was 62+-14 and 62%(58/94) were women. Pre and post operative manometric and prolonged pH testing were obtained on 31/94 (33%) patients. Ufestyle improvement and severity of heartbum/regurgitation and dysphagia were assessed on a 1-10 scale preoperatively and at 6-12 months postoperatively. Principles of repair included: reduction of the hemia, excision of the sac, crural approximation, and fundoplication over a 54Fr bougie (Nissen-72, Toupet-22). Results: Operative time was 157+-53 minutes. Length of stay was 2.7+-1.9 days. There were no mortalities. Conversion to Aopen@ repair was required in one patient (due to adhesions). Paired t tests comparisons of mean preoperative to mean 6-12 month scores showed significant improvement: lifestyle 6.9 to 8.1(p=0.001), heartbum/regurgitation 8.2 to 0.1(p=0.001), dysphagia 4.1 to 0.3(p=0.001). Differences in pre and post operative manometric findings were not significant; however, significant improvement in pH scores (15.0 to 2.1% of time pH less than 4) was seen in those patients tested (p=0.001). Conclusions: Our experience suggests that laparoscopic repair of giant paraesophageal hiatal hernias is a viable alternative to Aopen@ surgical approaches. Thoracic surgeons interested in the management of this complex process should become familiar with these minimally invasive techniques. Exlmperitoneel instillation of bupivacaine has been shown to be superior to placebo for postoperative analgesia following endoscopic extraperitoneel inguinal hemioplasly.

Background: Lung transplantation has emerged as a viable therapeutic option for patients with a vadety of endstage pulmonary diseases. As immediate posttransplant surgical outcomes have improved, the greatest limitation of lung transplantation remains chronic allograft dysfunction. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with resultant aspiration has been implicated as a potential contributing factor in allograft dysfunction. GERD is prevalent in end-stage lung disease patients, and even higher in patients after transplantation. This review reports the safety of lapraoscopic fundoplication surgery for the treatment of GERD in lung transplant patients. Methods: Eighteen of the 292 lung transplants performed at Duke University Medical Center underwent anti-reflux surgery for documented severe GERD. The safety and benefits of laparoscopic fundoplications in this population was evaluated. Results: The anti-reflux surgeries included 13 laparoscopic nissen fundoplications and 4 laparoscopic toupets. Two of the 18 patients have reported recurrence of GERD symptoms (11%), however, 24-hour pH testing was normal in all patients. Two other patients reported minor GI complaints postoperatively (nausea, bloating). There were no deaths or intraoperative complications from the anti-reflux surgery. After fundoplication surgery 12 of the 18 patients showed measured improvement in pulmonary function (67%). Conversion was necessary in one patient (5.6%), due to extensive adhesions. Conclusions: GERD occurs commonly in the posttransplant lung population. Laparoscopic fundoplication surgery canbe performed safely with minimal morbidity and mortality. In addition to resolution of reflux symptoms, improvement in pulmonary function may be seen in this population after fundoplication. Lung transplant patients with severe GERD should be strongly considered for anti-rallux surgery.",

            "text": "Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Seattle, WA Controversy exists around the role and appropriate indications for laparoscopic assisted colon resection. We present in detail our technique for laparoscopic assisted total colectomy, developed during 185 consecutive laparoscopic colon surgeries, including 14 total colectomies. The procedure is performed with the patient in a modified lithotomy position using two 12 mm ports and three 5mm ports. Instrumentation includes a 10 mm 30 degree scope, harmonic scalpel, 5 mm bowel graspers, and 5 mm flexible retractors for exposure of the distal rectum. Operative strategy is sequential mobilization of the entire large intestine from distal to proximal colon is followed by intracorporeal mesenteric division going from distal to proximal. Specifics of patient positioning, surgeon and assistant positioning, and technical pitfalls are presented for each sequence of mobilization and mesenteric division of the different segments of the large intestine. Technical pitfalls with specific solutions include splenic flexure mobilzation and distal rectal dissection. Specimen removal is performed through either a 5 cm suprapubic incision, a mini-Pfannensteil incision, or an ileostomy site, depending on the exact procedure performed. Standard anastomotic techniques are used as indicated. Retrospective review of our 14 cases demonstrated a 7% (1/14) conversion rate and a mean operative time of 185 minutes. We conclude that laparoscopic assisted total colectomy can be performed with acceptable operative times by GI tract surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills and appropriate OR and OR team resources. Introduction: The majority of common bile duct (CBD) stones can be cleared successfully by ERCP. Large stones, un-retrievable from CBD by usual endoscopic methods, are usually approached surgically. Open CBD exploration carries a relatively high morbidity and mortality rate in elderly patients. Recent reports showed that a combination of ERCP and ESWL might be an alternative approach to this problem. Objective: The aim of this study was to asses the feasibility of ESWL in combination with ERCP in clearing large stones from CBD in elderly patients. Methods: Patients with symptomatic choledocholithiasis in whom ERCP failed to retrieve stones from CBD were referred for ESWL. All patients had severe co-morbid conditions, which precluded safe surgical procedure. After ESWL the patients undenNent repeated ERCP until complete removal of stones. Results: Five patients with mean age of 70 y. ( range 65-72) were included in the study. A total of 17 ERCP and 6 ESWL were performed. There was no morbidity and mortality after the procedures. In all patients the CBD was completely cleared of stones. The patients were followed for 86-24 months (mean 46) and remained asymptomatic. Conclusion: Elderly patients with CBD stones that are not extractable by ERCP may be successfully treated with ESWL followed by endoscopic removal of fragments. This approach appears to be a safe alternative to surgical common bile duct exploration. Advantages of laparoscopic surgery include shortened hospital stay, decreased post-operetive pain and earlier retum to activity. Studies have indicated that these benefits are realized in laparoscopic Nissen flJndopiication. A Medline review of the literature revealed no studies investigating whether minimizing port size in laparoscopic Nissen [undoplicatton would augment these benefits.",

Background: Referral to surgery is usually reserved for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients with poor quality of life despite medical therapy. However, an appropriate quality of life threshold for referral is not wellestablished. Objective: To determine what quality of life threshold for medically-managed patients would justify laparoscopic fundoplication to optimize long-term outcomes. Methods and procedures: Decision analysis using a Markov model to simulate long-term health outcomes after laparoscopic fundoplication or continuation of dally prescription medication over 10 years. Peer reviewed publications were located with a MEDLINE search for English-language articles for adult patients since 1994 to obtain probability estimates for the model. Health-related quality of life was represented in the model by utilities between 0 and 1.0, where 0 represents death and 1.0 represents freedom from disease. The base case analysis assumed a cohort of otherwise healthy patients with typical GERD symptoms who require daily medication. Results: Surgery is associated with better long term quality of life if the utility with medical treatment is below 0.99. For medically treated patients with a utility of 0.90 (equivalent to the health state of mild angina), surgery confers a benefit of 0.64 quai~ adjusted life years (QALY) over continuing medical treatment. For scores of 0.82 (equivalent to the health state of chronic colitis), the benefit of surgery is 1.18 QAI_Y. Sensitivity analysis shows these results to be relatively insensitive to reasonable variations in baseline risks of surgical mortality, surgical failure, and re-operation. Conclusions: Based on cument estimates of morbidity and mortality for laparoscopic fundoplication, this model suggests that surgery would benefit patients with even modest decrements in quality of life on medical therapy. Explicit quantification of utility scores for GERD patients should be considered to aid clinical decision making.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Definitive treatment of pancreatic insuiinoma is by excision of the turnout. Traditionally this has required a major laparotomy not at all in keeping with the size of the turnout itself, however, a laparoscopic approach would appear to be perfectly feasible and offers obvious advantages to the patient. We present the operative technique and the advantage of hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.Patients: We performed this operation to two patients (a 57-year-old man and a 70-year-old man). The indication of HALTD is limited to the early gastric cancers with submucosal invasion (TI: UICC) at U region of the stomach. Operative procedure: One 10mm and Three 5 mm trocars were inserted to the abdominal cavity. Then a 3 inches upper midline abdominal incision was made to set up the HandPo~_ (Smith & Nephew Inc. USA). The left gastroepiploic and short gastric vessels were dissected using laparoscopic coagulating shears (LCS_, Ethicon Inc.). The left gastric artery was clipped and dissected. The anterior and posterior vagus nerves were dissected preserving hepatic and antropyloric branch. The esophagus was divided, then stomach was pulled out from the HandPort site. After a 25mm anvil head (ILS_, Ethicon Inc.) was inserted into esophagus, the regional lymph nodes located along the right gastroepiploic artery, the right gastric artery, the common hepatic artery and the celiac artery were dissected under the direct vision through the abdominal incision. Total gastrectomy was followed by the reconstruction of the Roux-en-Y method using ILS_. Results: The mean operating time was 363.5 min. These patients were able to walk on the 1st postoperative day and take a meal on 5th postoperative day. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 16 days. Conclusion: This novel technique is available for minimally invasive surgery for the early gastric cancer. The aim of this retrospective study was to confirm the feasibility of laparoscopy-assisted surgery (I_AS) for colorectal neoplasm in geriatric patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS : During May 1995 to April 2000, 74 patients with colorectal neoplasm underwent I.AS in our hospital. Fourteen patients were older than or equal to 75 years old (the aged group), and the remaining 60 patients were younger than 75 years old (the non-aged group). During the same study periods, 46 patients with colorectal neoplasm older than or equal to 75 years old underwent open surgery(OS group). Patients demographic features were compared between LAS-aged group and LASnon-aged group (STUDY 1), and between LAS-aged group and OS-aged group (STUDY 2). A p-value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistical significance. RESULTS : In STUDY 1, neither patients gender, histroy of previous abdominal surgery, operative time, amount of hemorrhage, conversion rate to laparotomy nor preoperative and postoperative complications such as hypertension, diabetic, ischemic heart disease, or respiratory disease were statistically significant between beth groups. Futhermore, amount of postoperative analgesics, postoberative oral resumption, duration of hospital stay, recurrence rates were not significantly different. In STUDY 2, the mean operative time of the LAS group was significentiy longer than that of the OS group ( 273 min vs. 188 min : p = 0.015 ). Mean blood loss of the I.AS group was significantly less than that of the OS group ( 110 ml vs. 192 ml : p = 0.005 ). None of the remaining factors related to the preoperative and postoperative complications and recurrence were significantly different between the two groups. However postoperative oral resumption( p = 0.05 ) and duration of the hospital stay ( p = 0.057 ) tended to be earlier in the I_AS group than in the OS group. CONCLUSIONS : Laparoscopy-assisted surgery is an adequate treatment for colorectai neoplasm even in geriatric patients. The introduction of labaroscopic techniques after residency training has created a new teaching paradigm focusing on laparoscopic workshops with animate course training and limited preceptor instruction. The purpose of this study was to test the benefit of an animate course and evaluate the role of proctoring in learning to perform laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR).",

Background: Advance laparescopic courses, highlighting suturing skill, are needed for surgeons who routinely perform laparosoopic cholecystectomy before they start new demanding procedures. This study is conducted to assess the impact of the advanced laparescopic course on laparoscopic surgical skill and the clinical practice pattern of the participants. Method: A survey was mailed to all eighty one participants of our advanced laparosoopic courses, regarding suture techniques employed at the time of questionnaire, procedures performed in the clinical practice. The course consists of three half days, covedng sutudng practice, suture-closure of duodenal perforation, Nissen fundoplication, and nephrectomy. Results Twenty-eight out of eighty-one participants responded the survey (Response rate 34.6%). Acquisition or improvement of suturing skill was noted in 15 (53.6%). As a result, twenty-two surgeons are able to tie knots laparosoopicelly (78.6%), seventeen surgeons intracorporeally (60.7%) and five surgeons extracorporeally (17.9%). Nine surgeons started laparoscopic closure of perforated ulcer after the courses (32.1%). Skill acquis~ion or improvement in suturing was noticed in all. Seven surgeons started CBD exploration after the courses (25~176 Suturing skill of these surgeons at the course was none in all, and intracorporeal knot tying in all at the survey. F'Ne surgeons started laparosoopic splanectomy after the course (17.9\"/.). Sutudng skiU of these surgeons at the course was none in all, and intracorporeal knot tying in all at the survey. No relation was found between skill acquisition and the profile of respondents, including age, experience in general or laparoscopic surgery. Conclusion Advance laparoscopic course has a tremendous impact not only on surgical skill, but on the clinical practice patterns. Surgeons who have learned suturing skill in the course tend to start more demanding procedures after thaL It has been reported that laparoscopic hemioplasty (LH) yields reduced postopertive disability of exercise.

The objective of this study is to compare the surgical performance of manual and roboti-(:ally assisted laparoscopic surgery. Twenty medical students without any surgical experience were randomized to perform a set of laparosoopic tasks either manually or robotically assisted (ZEUS) to evaluate the efficiency of a set of basic endoscopic movements: dropping beads in receptacles, running a 25 cm rope, capping a hypodermic needle, suture and laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a cadaver liver. All exercises were recorded on videotape for later time motion analysis. A quantitative time-motion analysis was carried out to evaluate the speed of skill performance and the number of actions. Primary efficacy parameters were total time and total amount of actions required to finish the several tasks. Statistical analysis was done using the statistical package of SPSS 9-0 for Windows. The time required to complete the dropping beads exercise and the laparoscopic cholecystectomy was significant longer when done robotically assisted (p---0.001 and p=0.05). Picking up the beads, grasping the rope and picking up either the needle or cap were tasks that required less actions to complete when performed robotically assisted (p=0.011, p=0.030 and p=0.015).

While avoiding the potential risks of gastric and esophageal injury, in the experienced hands it provides low rates of postoperative dysphagia and reflux recurrence. Pharyngeal pH monitoring has recently been used to identify patients with extraesophageal symptoms induced by gastroesophageal reflux. We employed this method of acid detection to evaluate patients with respiratory symptoms prior to and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. METHODS: Twelve patients underwent symptom evaluation, esophageal manometry and 24 hour pH monitoring with a pharyngeal probe before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Episodes of pharyngeal acid exposure were considered abnormal if the pH dropped below 4, occurred simultaneously with esophageal acidification, and occurred outside meal times and a one hour postprandial period. Continuous data was analyzed using student t-tast and ordinal data using a one-tailed Wilcoxon Ranks Sum test. RESULTS: Symptoms of aspiration, laryngeal irritation, and heartburn were improved by operative treatment (p<0.05).The LES pressure before and after operative intervention was 13mmHg and 18mmHg, respectively (p=0.09). There was a significant change in both upright (7.0% to 1.0%) and total (4.9% to 0.6%) percent time acid exposure in the distal esophagus after operative treatment. Pharyngeal acid reflux episodes were decreased from 4.7 to 0.7 episodes/24hr, (p=0.t5). CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment of GERD is effective at controlling subjective and objective measurements of extraesophageal reflux. The use of pharyngeal pH monitoring may help in selecting which patients with respiratory symptoms will benefit from antireflux procedures.

Therefore prompt urgent diagnosis and therapy are needed and open surgery is usually necessary. However, several papers regarding with laparoscopic resection of Mecksi's diverticulum or.bleeding tumor of small bowel were recently reported. In this study, we assessed the outcome of enteral bleeding retrospectively and evaluated indication of laparoscopic management for enteral bleeding. Patients and results: Patients who had accurate diagnoses of enteral bleeding preoperatively were 5 cases from January 1997 to August 2000. All had emergency arteriography in which 3 had extravasation of contrast media and I had tumor stain. One case with no abnormal findings in arteriography had tube enterography and a big enteral diverticulum was detected. Each diagnosis of 5 cases is Meckers diverticulum, leiomyoma, enteral mural aneurysm, lilac pseudo-aneurysm related retroperitoneal abscess, and Crohn's disease. Open surgery was selected for 2 cases (lilac aneurysm and Crohn) who had poor conditions due to shock and laparoscopic surgery was selected in the other. It was difficult for detecting bleeding site in case with enteral mural aneurysm and converted to open surgery. On the other hands, it was easy for detecting each lesions in cases with Meckers diverticulum and leiomyoma and wedge resection of ileum and partial enterotomy were done by laparoscopy-assisted fashion, respectively. Each operative time was 70 and 100 minutes and oral intake was started at 3POD and 6POD, respectively. Two cases required open surgery and 1 case with conversion were obliged to have artificial ventilation for ARDS. Condusion: It was concluded that Meckers diverticulum and benign tumor of small intestine without shock were good candidates of laparoscopic management for enteral bleeding.

Repair in the first 22 patients utilized a simple polypropylene mesh fixed to the esophageal hiatus with silk suture and the endoscopic hernia stapling device. Since early 1997. all repairs utilized a composite mesh developed by the authors which is composed of a 'darted' PTFE teflon cuff secured to the nee-hiatus with polypropylene suture. The mesh was then secured to the hiatus and the fundoplication secured to the hiatus and diaphragm in the same manner as in the first 22 patients.",

PURPOSE: Video images obtained during minimally invasive surgery suffer from limitations in illumination that result in color distortion and degradation of image quality. Real time histogram equalization applied to the video signal can result in a better image. The subjective improvement in the image quality is correlated with an edge detection technique to quantify the improvement. METHODS: Video of a laparoscopic procedure was obtained using standard MIS equipment and was analyzed in real time using a digital signal processor. The signal was subjected to a histogram equalization algorithm on the processor board and fed back to a monitor. The processing speed was fast enough so that the surgeons could detect no delay between the processed view and the actual surgical scene. Several images were captured in both processed and unprocessed form. The images were analyzed using a Sobel edge detection algorithm and the increase in the number of edge pixels of each form was computed. The increase in the edge pixels was compared to the subjective image quality. RESULTS: Twenty images were analyzed. In all cases histogram equalization resulted in an improved image. The more dramatic the subjective improvement in image quality, the greater the increase in the number of edge pixels detected, indicating that the subjective assessment of quality was reflected in an increase in the number of features seen. The results ranged from a 41% increase in edge pixels for images that were judged only slightly better in quality to over a 5400% increase in edge pixels where a dramatic increase in image quality was obtained.Detailed data will be presented as well as examples of the processed images. CONCLUSION: Histogram equalization of an image using a proprietary algorithm and digital signal processing results in an operative view where features can be more easily discemed. The resulting clarity of the operative image translates into subjective improvement of the surgical experience. Congenital duodenal obstruction is uncommon. In general the lesion becomes evident in the newborn or in early years in life, although in a few cases if may manifest in the adult pa~ent (20). We report a case of a 27 year-old female with Down's syndrome and duodenal obstruction by a duodenal web in whom endoscopic treatment was not feasible. We review different treatment options for this rare anomaly and describe an innovative approach by resecting the duodenal web utilizing laparoscopic endoluminal surgery. Duodenal webs are the third leading cause of digestive tract obstruction in childhood (3). Congenital duodenal obstructions are rare in the adult population. Duodenal webs account for less than 2% of the obstructions but the true incidence is difficult to estimate because more than half of the cases are reported later in life (11). Patients with Down's syndrome have an increase incidence of duodenal anomalies. Duodenal webs result from incomplete recanalization of the duodenum during the early weeks in life (2). Webs consist of mucosa and submucosa and rarely have muscular layer (11). Most webs are proximally to the ampulla of Vater (3). The reason why some of these congenital anomalies may only become manifest later in adult life is unexplained. Some suggest that chronic inflammation with superimposed acute edema may suddenly change a tight but asymptomatic lesion into an obstructing and symptomatic one. The role of endoscopy in the management of duodenal webs has been mainly diagnostic to confirm barium studies of the gastrointestinal tract. With the progress of technology and the increase ability of the endoscopists techniques to cut and ablate the lesions are feasible. The development of laparoscopic surgery has provided a different approach to gastrointestinal surgery. The improvement of lens and instrumentation has lead to the emergence of Laparoscopic Endoluminal Surgery (LES). Our center reports on 18 esophagomyotomies performed from November 1996-August 2000; in all cases ultrasonic coagulation shears were utilized in performing the esophageal myotomy. The shears were used to develop the plane between the muscularis and the mucosa, then the device was applied to divide the muscular layer. A Dot fundoplication was then performed in 17 patients. One patient underwent a Toupet fundoplication. Intraoperative endoscopic examination of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter was used in all cases.",

It is therefore beneficial to utilize the incision throughout the operation that is necessary for intact organ removal. Longer follow-up is needed to assess whether the difference in WIT will have an effect on graft survival.

Introduction: Chest tubes afer thoracic surgm'y have traditionally resulted in prolonged hospital stay and morbidity. In this study we have designed a mechanism to eliminate prolonged ches: tube drainage with the benefit of curly hospital discharge. Methods: From Javuary 1999 through July 2000, 245 consecutive patients refcn'~ for diagnostic and/or therapeutic lung resection underwent video-assisted tho'.ra.'scopic surgery (VATS) with lung resection. Patients were placed in three ~agories for chest tube removaL 1) Removal within 1-2 hrs following surgery. 2) In hospital management of air leak with removal of cbest tube prior to discharge. 3) Discharge home with chest tube/Heimlich valve with removal as an outpatient. Chest tubes were removed when there was no air leak, expansion of the lung was demonstrated, and drainage was minimal. Results: Charts were available for review for 237 of the 245 patients. This included 111 males and 126 females ranging from 16 to 89 years. Resections included 133 wedge resections, 16 segmental resections and 86 Iobectomies. The final pathology was benign in 97 cases and malignant in 140 cases. Of the 235 patients, 126 had chest tubes removed within I-2 hours following surgery. Eighty-four patients had chest tube management with removal during their hospital stay. Twenty-seven patients had a persistent leak, which was managed with chest tube/Heimlich valve'as an outpatient. In group !, patients had an average length of stay of 1.2 days with only 4 patients requiring chest tube reinsertion. The average hospital stay for patients in group 2 and 3 were 1.6 days and 1.7 days respectively. Conclusion: Clearly this data indicates that creative and movstive management of chest tubes following VATS lung resection allows an unprecedented shorter hospital stay. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recognized as the gold standard for treatment of gallstone disease, and is now commonly a junior resident case at teaching institutions. This study seeks to determine whether the conversion rate from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy has changed over the last 8 years at our institution.",

With concerns about port site recurrences and difficult Crohn's mesentery, it is recommended that one begin their LAP experience with benign, noninflammatory cases. There ere very few such cases, making it difficult to accrue experience. The following is a review of one surgeon's initial LAP experience with ileocol[c resection for CD. Methods: A retrospective review of all LAP ileocolectomies by a single surgeon without prior advanced laparoscopic experience was done. The patients were divided into two equal groups of 28 (1: 1/97-2/11/99, 2: 2/17199-6/00), to compare eady and late experience. (11), entero-intestinal fistula (13), enter-vesicle fistula (3), extensive adhesions (4), additional small bowel disease (4), and repeat ileocoleotomy (6). Complications occurred in 9 patients, 4 in the group I (anastomaotic bleed, enteretomy, intra-abdominal seroma, and port site hematoma) and 5 in the group 2 (wound infection, prolonged ileus, partial small bowel obstruction, anastomotic bleed, and phlegmon,). Conclusions: LAP ileocolic resectiov for CD, even with complex disease, is a safe way to begin LAP surgery, il one accepts a high initial conversion rate. With experience, OR time ant conversion rate decrease. Lumbar hernias are uncommon. There are three types of lumbar hernia: congenital, acquired and Indsional hernias. The acquired hernia can appear in two forms: the inferior (Petit) type and the supedor type, first described by Grynfeltt in 1866.

Female sex and race were not significant dsk factors possibly due to selection bias. Cholesterol, padty and menarche contributed no nsk for gallstones. Background: Certain surgical strategies, including carbon dioxide (C02) insufflation in laparoscopy, have been demonstrated to induce a hypoxic environment. Patients with hypoxic cancers have a worse prognosis than those with an adequate oxygen supply, particularly in head and neck cancers and cervical tumours. The undelying mechanism has not been elucidated. Expression of Matdx-Metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been correlated with enhanced tumour aggression, we investigated the induction of MMPs in tumours in response to hypoxia. Methods: Colonic (SW1222) and breast (MDA-MB231) adenocaminoma cell lines were exposed to a hypoxic environment of helium or left in normal growth conditions(Control). Media from cells was removed after exposure to normoxia, hypoxia, and reoxygenation for 24 hours after a 4 hour exposure to hypoxic conditions. Gelatin zymography was carried out to determine total activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Activity of MMPs correlates with density of the gel bands. Gel bands were analysed using densitometdc analysis. The anterior laparoscopir approach requires precarious dissection around the lilac vessels to expose the IA-L5 level. Furthermore, a retroperituneal endoscopic approach to the LA-L5 level requires a technically demanding dissection to access the LS-SI disc space. A unique lateral laparoseopic approach to the LA-L5 disc space allows concurrent access to the LS-SI space while avoiding major dissection around the iliac vessels. This paper describes this novel lateral approach and reviews the initial clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Traditionally, urachal anomalies have been treated by open excision to prevent complications of infection and possible malignant change. This is associated with significant post-operative pain, morbid~, and prolonged convalescence. Laparoscopic excision minimizes the morbidity of definitive therapy and is cosmetically superior. However, laparoscopy in young children and infants is not widely practiced. Our case is unique in that laparoscopy was used for the definitive treatment of a symptomatic urachal cyst in an infant. In summary, we believe that laparoscopic excision of urachal anomalies can be safely performed in infants and children. Patient's stress response is an inevitable physiologic consequence of every surgical procedure, whereby it has been assumed, that laparoscopy minimizes the surgical trauma and thus patient's stress response. The purpose of the current study was to assess the hepatic metabolic response of diagnostic laparoscopy compared to open abdominal exploration in a small animal model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 3 groups (n=28 each). Group A underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy (LS) using a CO2pneumoperitoneum with a pressure of 6 mmHg. Animals of group B had a 5 cm taparotomy (LP) and underwent open abdominal exploration. Group C served as control group (CON) and animals only had anesthesia. Animals were characterized by their body weights, daily food intakes, hepatic glycogen contents, activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (AL'r), bilirubin, bile acids and glucose in plasma. Body weight gain and food intake did not differ among the 3 groups. Hepatic glycogen contents were significantly decreased after LS and LP compared to CON for 8 days postoperatively (-32%), whereas plasma glucose, bile acids and glucose remained unchanged. AST was 3-4 fold increased after LS and LP compared to CON for 8 days postoperatively. Both surgical interventions (LS and LP) induced a hepatic metabolic response which could be confirmed by a decreased glycogen content. Plasma glucose levels were maintained demonstrating that glucose homeostasis is not severly altered. The indications for elective sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis are deady defined however, lapamscopic sigmoidectomy has failed to become routine. Concerns remain regarding prolonged operative times, extensive use of instrumentation, and limited reductions in hospitalisation. The purpose of this report is to compare a standardized approach to laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy to open colectomy for diverticular disease in one institution.",

Introduction: With over 600,000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in the United States annually, it is easy to imagine that at least 2.5 million clips are applied and retained in patients each year for this procedure alone. The most commonly applied ligating clip is the crush type clip delivered through a 10mm application device. Almost universally, multiple clips are applied to the retained side of the cystic duct and artery, implying a lack of surgeon confidence in the retention strength of any single clip. This concern is borne out by the fact that the single greatest cause of bile leakage is clip slippage. Method: Pre-formed, titanium spring ligation clips (Smm applicator), were tested for transverse and longitudinal holding force on simulated vessels and compared with published results for conventional crush clips from 2 manufacturers (10mm applicator) and crush clips ( Conclusion: The new clip design was found to demonstrate significantly better holding forces and significantly more consistent application than the crush clips with 25% of the crush clip falling below 147 grams and only 2% of the preformed clips removed with less than 409 grams of pulling force. This design may offer better protection against cystic duct bile leakage and clip slippage owing to patient activity or inconsistent clip application. The morbidity, efficacy, and costs of lapamscopic reoperative antireflux operations have not been established. This study compares cost and outcomes of laparoscopic reoperaUons to initial antireffux procedures. 30 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication revisions were compared to 60 random patients undergoing primary laparoscopic fundoplication undertaken between 1995 and 1999. Patients were of similar age (52ys + 18.3 vs 49ys \u2022 15.0,1o=0.4) and severity of GERD (DeMeester score 31:1:10.6 vs 70:1: 64.1,p=0.4). Patient satisfaction was queried using scales (1 for worst, 10 for best) via written questionnaires that included relief from symptoms, need for antJreflux medications, and capability of returning to precp activities.

Results: Courses of medical therapy varied, but 9 patients were receiving inpatient treatment at the time of surgery, or had recently had inpatient treatment. 2 patients had failed cyclosporin treatment and had resumed prednisone (> 40 mg/day). Profound weight loss or biochemical evidence of malnutrition was present in 9 patients (67=/o) and 6 (50%) were on TPN preoperatively. 4-port access was used in all cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 cases (abscess, rectal bleeding, ileostomy diarrhea). Postoperative length of stay was 5.4 +/-0.4 days compared to 8.8 +/-1.8 days(p < 0.05) for a group of 6 patients who had undergone open subtotal colectomy for the same indications. Systemic steroids were withdrawn in all patients, although 2 required hydrocortisone enemas for rectal disease. 11 patients underwent proctectomy and pelvic pouch construction within 4 months of the laparoscopic procedure. The first 3 patients had protective loop ileostomies, but the remaining 9 patients did not. There were no anastamotic leaks, and all patients have excellent pouch function at 1-24 month followup. Conclusions: Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is associated with early hospital discharge in acutely ill patients with UC. Relatively high morbidity is likely related to these patients' compromised status at the time of surgery. Subsequent pelvic pouch construction was facilitated by the absence of a large abdominal incision and of peritoneal adhesions. Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy, followed by proctectomy with pelvic pouch construction an d eliminat=on of ileostomy is an excellent alternative to conventional 2and 3-staged surgical treatment of fulminant UC.",

However suture repair of common bile duct is sometimes difficult technically, and T-tube insertion tends to prolong hospital stay up to 3 weeks. In order to simplify closure technique of CBD and avoid T-tube insertion for shorter hospital stay, we applied VCS titanium clip to repair CBD in clinical cases. We evaluated efficacy and safety of this method. (Method) Before closing CBD, we performed intraoperative cholangiogram to neglect outflow obstruction of papilla Vater. After lithotripsy, we applied VCS clips ((~ 3ram) to repair CBD. As we can expect pressure tolerance of cliprepaired CBD up to 50 mmHg according to our preceded pig experimatal data, we applied clips every 0.5 mm -,, 2ram. No bile drainage was attempted to place. (Results) We have 4 clinical cases( 3 male, 1 female). Size of CBD exploration was 5 ram, 10ram, 10mm and 20mm, respectively, mainly according to the size of largest stone.

We present the case of a recurrent posttraumatic splenic pseudecyst managed by laparascopic cystectomy. Several methods of treatment exist, however splenic preservation is preferred. Lapazoscopic skill evaluation of general surgery residents is usually a subjective process, carried out by senior surgeons in the operating room using fuzzy criteria. The aim of this study was to develop and assess an objective laparoscopic surgical skill scale using Hidden Marker Models (HMM) based on hapdc informations, tool/tissue interactions and visual task decomposition. Eight subjects (six residents at different training levels: 2xR1, 2xR3, 2xR5 and two experts surgeons: 2xES) performed laparoscopic choleoystectomy on pigs following a specific 7 step protocol. During surgery, they used an instrumented grasper equipped with force/torque if/r) sensors able to measure forces and torques at the hand/tool interface and synchronized with a video of the operative maneuvers. Fourteen types of tool/tissue interactions, each associated with unique F/r signatures, were defined from frame-by-frame video analysis. The statistical distances between HMMs representing expert surgeons and residents were significantly different. Major differences were: (i) F/T magnitudes (ii) tool/tissue interactions used and transitions between them (iii) time intervals in each tool/tissue interaction and overall completion time. The greatest differencr in performaaco was between El and g3. Smaller changes were seen as expertise increased. This obJeCtive learning curve indicates that the laparosoopic surgical residents acquire a major portion of their skill between the first and the third years of their 5 years of training. The aim of the current study was to assess the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic colentomy for cure of left colon and rectal cancer, using a three trocar tenhnlque. MATERIALS AND METHODS: from June 1996 to July 2000, 24 patients left colon and rectal cancer underwent complete laparoscopic or laparoscopic assisted colectomy using only three ports of entry instead of the 4 ports usually required. W'rth the patient in normal supine position a 10 mm. t]'coar is inserted in the midline 3 cm above the umbilicus, a 10 mm trcoar is placed just above the pubis, 2 cm on the left far from the midline and a 10 mm. tzocar is inserted in the right midclavicular line just below the umbilicus. The patient is then placed in a full Trendelemburg posfdon, on the right flank, The assistant holds the camere inserted through the trocar placed in the right midclavicular line, allowing the surgeon to perform the procedure autonomously by utilizing the remaining two ports. RESULTS: All the 24 procedures were completed laparoscopic~ly: 5 left colectomies, 7 sigmo=d resections, 11 anterior resections and 1 Hartmann's procedure. In 18 patients we completed a full laparoscopic colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis, whereas in the remaining 6 we performed extracorporeal anastomosis. We used a 6 cm minilaparotomy for specimen retrieval. There were no intraoperetive complications and 3 (12.5%) postoperative complications requiring reoperation: 2 intestinal occlusions due to adhesions and 1 anastomotic fistula. The average number of lymph nodes harvested in resected specimens was 16 (range 6-26) and the mean distance of the tumor from margins of resection was 9 cm (range 5.21). The average operative time was 180 min (range 120-240) and the mean hospital stay was 8.5 days (range 5.34). CONCLUSIONS: Three trocar laparoscopic colectomy is a reliable and safe technique in which most of the procedure is performed by one surgeon assisted only by a camera operator. The use of only three trcoars decrease the risk of iatrogenic injuries. INTRO: This study compares the performance of a set of standardized surgical skill tests using conventional laparoscopic instruments (CLI) and a robotic surgery system (RS)in subjects with differing surgical expertise. The effect of MIST Virtual Reality (VR) training and a 3 dimensional visual system on skill test performance are also examined. METHODS: 3 test cohorts were recruited: attending surgeons(n=12), general surgery residents(n=lO) and medical students(n=10). Each subject performed a set of 4 tests: bead drop into a container, object transfer, suture placement and intracorporeal knot tie. .Each test set was performed using CLI and the Zeus RS(Computer Motion Inc, Goleta CA). RS test sets were performed with both a standard television monitor and a 3 dimensional visual system. Performance of each test was assessed by both time and error rates. Residents and students, but not attending surgeons were randomly assigned to receive VR training prior to performing the test set. A 2 tailed Hest was used for comparison of means of paired samples. Significance was assumed at 10<0.05. RESULTS: 91% of subjects completed all tests. Combined data from each test cohort demonstrated that CLI were faster and produced lower error rates than RS for both bead drop and suture tests (p<O.02). RS was faster and produced lower error rates than CLI for object transfer and was faster than CLI for knot tying using the standard television monitor(p<O.O3).The 3 dimensional visual system resulted in no improvement in either speed or error rates. Subjects who received VR training prior to testing showed no consistent improvement in performance though reduction in error rates approached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The Zeus RS provided no advantage over CU for simple repetitive tasks such as bead drop and simple suture placement. For complex tasks such as knot tying and object transfer, RS was superior to CLI. MIST VR training and the 3D visual system did not significantly improve skill test performance. Methods: We performed LS in nine patients with refractory or relapsing TTP. The operative as well as the early and late post operative course and complications were recorded.",

There were no intra-operative complications. One patient was converted to open cholecystectomy due to extensive inflammation in the right upper quadrant. One patient had a post-operative gastric leak from the non-robotic portion of the procedure. Average time to engage the system during surgery was 7.4 min. (9.5 for lap Nissens) and average system time was 104 min. (132 for lap Nissens). In most cases, one or two additional 5 mm auxiliary ports were used for additional retraction. In the authors' judgment, 3 cases could not have been successfully completed laparcscopically without robotic assistance (extensive adhesiolysis necessary for bowel mobilization, difficult crural closure during laparoscopic Nissen, and ability to exhaustively examine the small bowel during exploratory laparoscopy). Success with robotic laparoscopic surgery depends upon existing experience in laparoscopic surgery, adequate training regarding robotic technical issues, careful port placement, an anesthesia team willing to accommodate the system, and team coordination during procedures. Robotic systems expand the scope and difficulty of laparoscopic operations, and offer the future promise of at-distance surgical intervention. Recently a minimally invasive operation for gastric malignancies has been advocated. Here we have performed laparoscopic gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection using hand-assisted laperoscopic surgery (HALS) on 83 cases of gastric cancer from March 1998 to August 2000; distal gastrectomy in 78 cases, proximal gastrectomy in 2, and total gestrectomy in 3. The dissection of all group 1 and group 2 lymph nodes defined according to the general rules of the Japanese Research Society for Gastdc Cancer was completely carded out in the distal gastrectomy cases. Reconstruction after distal gastrectomy was made by Billreth 1 method in 67, and by Billroth 2 method in 11, respectively. Billroth 1 reconstruction was applied intracorporeally to the former 29 cases using the double stapling method with a conventional circular stapling device, and in the latter 38 cases 'the quadrilateral (square) stapling technique' with a laparescopic linear stapling device was employed to prevent postoperative anastomotic bleeding and stanosis. The average duration of operation of 78 distal gastrectomy cases was 230 rain, which was significantly longer than that of conventional open surgery. The average blood loss was 132 ml which was significantly less than that compared with an open gaslmctomy. Postoperative complications from anastomosis resulted in leakage in one patient, bleeding in one patient and stenosis in one patient; all complications were treated conservatively. Postoperative pedods of walking flatus, oral feeding, and discharge were 1.1 days, 2,7 days, 3.3 days, and 13.7 days, respectively, which were all significantly sooner than those of conventional open gastrectomy patients. This technique is not only less invasive, but similarly safe and curative compared to an open gastrectomy. In case of colon diverticulitis with dense adhesion, the medial aprcach, which means initial mesenteric dissection followed by mobilization of the bowel, appears to be useful for safe and easy identification of the ureter and gonadal vessels before mobilizing the inflamed bowel from the lateral side.",

Although other variables may contribute to improvement in STS, advanced laparoscopic training at a tertiary referral center provides exposure to complex patients not otherwise encountered in surgical residency. This may account for the decrease in STS in ASA 3 and 4 patients A minimally invasive technique has been devised and tested for the performance of weight redudng surgery. The method of weight reduction is a modification of the bilio-pancreatic diversion procedure described by Scopinaro. A horizontal indsion about 4cm in length is made immediately medial to the left costal margin. Access to the stomach is easily achieved through this incision, as the stomach is the immediate posterior anatomical relation. The greater curvature of the stomach is delivered into the wound. From a point high on the greater curvature, the stomach is stapled and divided across its width using the 6cm Endoscopic GIA linear stapler/cutter, thus completely dividing the stomach. A second horizontal incision about 4 an in length is made to the nght of the umbilicus and infenody lateral to the rectus sheath. This incision allows the small bowel to be delivered into the wound so that accurate measurement prior to stapling can be carried out. Through this incision the small intestine and its mesentery are divided 250cm from the ileo-cecal junction using the Endoscopic GIA. The endoscopic linear vascular stapler can then be placed behind the wound so as to divide suffident mesentery for mobilization. A Roux-en-Y anastomosis of the proximal defunctioned intestinal segment is made 50cm from the ileo-cecal junction again using the Endoscopic GIA device. The proximal end 0fthe 250cm of divided ileum is then passed retrocolically to reach the upper incision where it is anastomosed to the stomach by the linear stapler cutter. The small incisions are dosed. Management is then identical to that used alter laparoscopic bilio-pancreatic by-pass. Roux-en-y gastric bypass has been shown to an effective procedure in the treatment of morbid obesity and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective altemafive. The creation of the Roux-en-Y gastro-jejunal anastomoses has remained an issue of contention with many alternative techniques and modifications reported in literature. The purpose of study was to critically analyze our experience of three different techniques of creation of the gastrojejunal anastomoses. Three different techniques of creation of gastrojejunal anastomoses were compared. These included use of EEA stapler (29 cases); use of Endo GIA stapler (20 cases) and hand sutured anastomotic technique (23 cases). Brief description of different techniques will be provided followed by a critical analysis of our results. Patients were studled for intraoperative time, blood loss, complications, weight loss, length of stay and wound problems. Significant differences were found in between these groups and they will be highlighted. Hand sewn anastomoses required more advanced skills, took a longer time but had better control of stoma size, lower wound infection rates and avoided stapler costs. Endo GIA anastomoses were more reproducible and took less time. Use of EEA resulted in higher incidence of wound infection and has a potential for oral-pharyngeal and esophageal trauma. We believe that Hand Sutured anastomotic technique provides for a safe gastro-jejunostomy avoiding all problems asseQated with stapled anastomoses. It provides a better control of stomal size, avoids stapler costs, eliminates the potential for oral-pharyngeal and esophageal trauma, and potentially decreases wound infection. Exploration of the bile duct at open operation is conventionally followed by insertion of a T-tube. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of T-tube insertion with direct suture closure of the duct following laparoscopic exploration.",

Hdler myotomy resulted in a reduction of LES pressures and vector volume. Conclusion: Manometric and 3D vector volume studies can be used to evaluate the morphology of the LES and can provide recognizable patterns in various fundoplication models and following a Heller myotomy. This information, in conjunction with patient symptoms and 24-hour pH studies, may provide a more thorough understanding of the efficacy and failure patterns of fundoplication techniques. Obiective of the study: The lower esophageal sphincter manometry of patients with hiatal hernia often displays a double hump configuration. It seems that this is due to gastric bemiation above the high pressure zone of the crur~ This study examines this manometric phenomenon in patients with hiatal bemia and relates it to the lower esophageal antireflux barrier. Methods: Manometric and 24-hour pH studies of 68 consecutive patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease were analyzed to obtain information regarding the double hump and acid reflux. Results: The findings of a manometric double hump correlated well with the presence of a hiatal hernia greater than 5cm. The mean pressure of the lower and upper high pressure zones was 12.~1.3 mmHg and 16.0~1.4 mmHg respectively. The overall length of the sphincter complex was greater in patients with a double hump (6.6:k0.3 vs. 4.3~.2, p<0.0001), but the length below the respiratory inversion point was constant (2.5~.2 vs. 2.2_+0.1, p--0.2). Resting pressures at the respiratory inversion point were significantly lower (4.9i-0.9 mmHg) than those measured at either high pressure zone (12.~1.3 mmHg and 16.0-2:1.4 mmHg). The location of the respiratory inversion point was seen most commonly at the superior margin of the distal high pressure zone. Double hump patients with a negative acid reflux score were found to have higher pressures in the distal high pressure zone than patients with acid reflux. Conclusions: The two high pressure zones comprising the manometric double hump represent the cmral and muscular components of the lower esophageal sphincter. Descriptive information regarding the double hump phenomenon is given, and the importance of the crural component of the lower esophageal sphinct~ in preventing acid reflux is stressed. This information stresses the importance of crural closure during laparoscopic antireflux surgery. For the application of the two component sealant in minimal invasive surgery a special adaptor for the trocar was designed in combination with a thin plastic catheter, which can be placed next to the wound surface which has to be sealed.",

We used a HALS method for 13 of them. The operating time of the low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resections with laparoscopic assistance was on average 187 minutes. The operating time of procedures using HALS method was on average 156 minutes. The HALS method allowed to shorten the operations by 31 minutes. CONCLUSION: The HALS method should be used when a pert of the procedure is performed in front of the abdominal wall, or if the operation results in colostomy. A surgeon with an inserted hand in the abdominal cavity can utilize a palpation examination that is usually used at open surgery. Soft palpation of organs and digital preparation together with the use of harmonic scalpel cuts on the operating time. Also, the HALS method keeps all the advantages of the mini invasive surgery.

Stein, M.D., Christian MOebius, M.D., Hubertus Feussner, M.D., J.ROdiger Siewert, M.D., Department of Surgery, Technische UniversitSt MOnchen, Klinikum r.d.lsar, Munich, Germany Introduction: Gastro-intestinal reflux disease (GERD)is a very common disorder in the western world. The acute disease can be sufficiently treated by medical therapy. To prevent relapse many patients require life-Ion~g medication. In these patients lapar0scopic antireflux surgery offers a good altemative. The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative results and compare pre-and postoperative quality of life alter laparoscopic Nissan fundoplication. Methods: Clinical investigations including esophageal manometry, pH monitoring and endoscopy and previously validated Quality of life Index were applied before and a median of 41 month after surgery in 75 patients. Results: The percent total time with pH <4 decreased from 10.4% to 3.2% on 24 hour pH monitoring. The mean pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter improved from 8.1 to 12.3 mmHg. Esophagitis healed in 93% of the patients, but intestinal metapiasia in the distal esophagus persisted in all patients when it was present before surgery. The overall Quality of life Index signiflcanUy improved from 86+_16 to 116+16. Conclusion: The data show that the iaparoscopic fundoplicaUon provides effective and durable relief in patients with GERD. The Quality of life Index significantly improved after surgery.

After formal laparoscopic training we have used needlescopic instrumentation (diameter <3.3 ram) for a variety of laparoscopic procedures. AIM: To determine if the use of needlescopic instrumentation increases operative time compared to standard laparoscopic techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal, comparative, non-randomized. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: BMI > 26, perforated inflammatory process. METHODS: From Aug 1999 to Aug 2000, we have performed a total of 127 laparoscopic procedures (38 using needlescopic instrumentation). According to selection criteria we have the following results: Needlescopic Cholecistectomy n=14 Mean Time(MT)= 64.74 Laparoscopic Cholecistectomy n=23 MT=49.38 p=0.0001 Needlescopic Nissen n=11 MT=96.36 Laparoscopic Nissen n=38 MT=87.76 p=0.1156 Needlescopic Appendectomy n--6 MT=55.83 Laparoscopic Appendectomy n---6 MT--40.83 p----0.0488 Needlescopic Heller n=2 MT 147.5 Laparoscopic Heller n= 6 MT=135.83 p=O.4058 and one Needlescopic Splenectomy was performed in 80 mins. we have not converted any needlescopic procedure to laparoscopic nor conventional open surgery and we have had no postoperative complications in the needlescopic group after a 10-month follow up. CONCLUSION: The use of needlescopic instruments has many applications in laparoscopic general practice. In selected cases and for experienced surgical teams, their use does not result in longer operative time(clinically significant) as compared to standard laparoscopic techniques.

This experimental study was performed to investigate the spread of intraperitoneal tumor cells following carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in rats. The effects of different insufflation pressures were also examined. Methods:Male Donryu rats weighing 180-220g were intraperitoneally injected with 5X1000000 ascites hepatoma AH 130 cells and randomized to 4 groups: Group A (n=14) and Group B (n=15) received CO2 pneumoperitoneum at 5 mmHg and 10 mmHg for 30 min, respectively; Group C(n=15) underwent a xipho-pubic laparotomy for 30 min; and Group D (n=15) underwent trocar placement alone for 30 min. Survival times and frequency of trocar site implantation (for Groups of A, B, and D)at autopsy were evaluated. Results: The median survival (days) was 17.0 in Group A, 15.5 in Group B, 15.5 in Group C, and 32.5 in Group D (P<0.05). The frequency of trocar site implantation was 57% in Group A, 53% in Group B, and 46% in Group D (NS). Conclusions: These results suggests that, compared with the sham-treatment, pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide may not fascilitate port site metastasis, regardless of the pressure of insufflation. However, similar to full laparotomy, pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide may promote the spread of tumor cells.S135METHOD OF VIDEOTHORACOSCOPIC PARASTERNAL LYMPHADIS-SECTION IN BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSE AND TREATMENTArtur H.

Alexander Matz, M.D., Arkadi Ischakov, M.D., Ilan Charuzi, M.D., Ofer Landau, M.D., Shlomo Kyzer, M.D., Department of Surgery 'B', E. Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel. The role of laparoscopic cholecystect0my (LC) as the treatment of acute cholecystitis is well established. However, controversy persists about whether LC is the treatment of choice for gangrenous cholecystitis. We undertook the present retrospective study in order to determine the results of LC on patients operated for gangrenous cholecystiUs as compared to the results on those undergoing LC for acute cholecystitis without gangrene. The study included 231 patients who had undergone LC for acute cholecystitis. The diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis was made only according to the histopathological report. Various variables, such as duration of preoperative symptoms conversion rate, intraoperative and postoperative complications, duration of the procedure and length of hospital stay, were analyzed. The group of 231 patients consisted of 147 cases with various forms of acute cholecystitis without gangrene (Group A) and 84 cases with gangrene (Group B). The two groups were similar in demographic attributes and clinical characteristics except for the presence of more men among the patients in Group B. The conversion rates in Group A and B were 3.4% and 2.3%, respectively (P=0.9017). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the length of surgery, incidence of intra-and postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay. The intraoperative findings of gangrenous cholecystitis do not increase the chance of conversion or occurrence of intra-or postoperative complications.

Introduction:Historically, thoracuscopic procedures have dramatically diminished insult to patients, but have been cumbersome to perform due to positioning of the patient, single lung ventilation, and imposition of the rib cage. We have addressed each of these issues and shortened procedures dramatically. Methods: In the past 36 months we have used a combination of team development, video assessment of team performance, minimizing instruments, Jod facility enhancement to safely shorten all and video assessment of procedure choreography. Conclusions: These data delinate that focusing on maximum efficiency during sophisticated VATS procedures allows a minimum of resource utilization, diminished anesthesia time, decreased the length of operative risk, and promotes improved outcomes per unit cost. Further, this experience provides a \"best practices\" model for minimally invasive surgery.",

Diagnosis may be difficult, as symptoms are often masked and physical examination is unreliable. Imaging studies are not accurate enough, and exploratory laparotomy carries a significant morbidity and mortality. The unstable patient is difficult to mobilize to the imaging department or to the operating room. Bedside laparoscopy may overcome these diffcultJes.We describe our initial experience with the use of bedside laparoscopy in critical patients with suspected abdominal pathology. The procedure was performed in 4 patients, over a 4 months period, and successfully completed ,n all four. Tne findings were. I) I, urbid ~uid consister,t w;U= a v;scus perforation in a patient with unexplained sepsis after cardiac surgery. 2) sterile hemorrhagic fluid in a patient with malignancy and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura. 3) a retroperitoneal mass from which biopsies were taken in a patient with sudden respiratory failure. 4) abdominal abscess in a patient after bowel resection for mesenteric embolism. None of these patients had a laparotomy after the laparoscopy. Patient 1 and 4 died a few hours after the procedure from sepsis, and patients 2 and 3 dies several days later.Bedside laparoscopy in the ICU is feasible, informative and accurate. It has a role in diagnosing abdominal pathologies and planning further treatment, It may save the need for non-therapeutic laparotomy. Unfortunately, the prognosis in these patients is poor. Advanced thoracoacopic surgery requires a method of obtaining reliable hemestasis to ensure successful outcomes. The recent introduction of bipolar vessel-sealing technology has made it possible to seal adedes and veins up to 7 mm in diameter safely and effectively through a 5 mm port. Chronic animal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the vesselsealing device on both the pulmonary vasculature and pulmonary parenchyma.",

Major vessels that were effe<~lvaly sealed by the system include the infedor pulmonary vein and branches of the main pulmonary admy.An procedures were completed successfully without complication. There were no failures of the device to achieve hemostasls, and no apparent injudes to surrounding tissues.\" In all procedures, the vessel-sealing device dissected tissue very well and there was no difference in surgical blood loss when compared to traditional techniques. Thoracescopy was performed completely through trocar sites using the 5 mm vessel-sealing device. Minithoracotemy was not required in any of the cases. Spedmans were morselized and brought out the 12 mm trocar site. Hospital stays ranged ~rom 1to 3 days.Iniial experience whh the laperoscopic bipolar vessel-sealing device in thoracoscopic surgery indicates that it is effective for dissecting and permanently sealing vessels commonly encountered in thoracoscopic lung reseotlons. Generally, it is thought that the technique of a laparoscopic colectomy as the treatment for the colo-rectal cancer is difficult. Therefore, it takes a long time at the operation time of a laparoscopic colectomy. To shorten the operation time and to assume a steady operation, we developed a laparoscopic colectomy which used the retroperitoneal scopy. The advantage of this technique is as follows. We can dissect the retroped. toneum in a short time. We can obtain excellent view. And, we can see the blood vessel and ureter. We will show our operation method of anterior resection. We insert the scope into the abdominal cavity. And, we observe the organs, liver, colon and others. Next, we insert the balloon from a left side of abdomen to the retroperitoneum. We e~pand the balloon and expand the retroperitoneum. We remove the balloon. Next, we flow the carbon dioxide in to the retroperitoneum. And we do retrepedtoneal scopy. We can see the dght and left common lilac artery, the right and left ureter, Abdominal aorta, and IMA under the retropedtomeal scopy. We are not disturbed view by other internal organs such as small intestines and can see these vessels easily. Next, we inserl the scope into the abdominal cavity. Aorta and IMA can be easily observed by incising the retropedtoneum at the dght side of the mesocolon sigmoideum. We ligate and dissect IMA. Next, we dissect the left side of the retropedtoneum and cut the colon. We do anastomosis. Laparoscopic assisted colectomy is done to the cancer of Cecum, Ascending colon, and Tranverse colon. We have performed laparoscopic colectomy for the colo-rectal cancers on 230 cases since 1994. The transition of the operation time is seen. The operation time has been shortened by using the retroperitoneal scopy. Present operation time is 120_}31 minutesin laparoscopic colectomy using retropedtoneaJ scopy. The postoperativus complication in this technique is not seen. Neither the hemorrhage nor the ureter trauma, etc. We will present the technique of the taparoscopic colectomy and our results. Splenic tumor, such as a hemangioma, lymphangioma, hamartoma, hemangic6areoma, malignant lymphoma, metastatic caranoma et al. is very rare and it is difficult to di~ preolm'atively whether it is malignant or not. The technique of hand-assisted laparocoplc splenectomy (HAts) was dcvdct0ed mainly for benign hematologic disease, such as idiopathic throm~nic purpura or heredit=y spherocytmis. We report a case of metastatic splenic tumor, rem~ by HALS. The patient is a 38-~r-old woman who undenvcut a hysterectomy, bilat~ ~y, omentectomy by diagnosis of fight ovarian carcinoma (stage lllc) three yems ago. The solitary tumor formation of 3.0cm in the spleen was noticeable in a CT scan and MPJ. Ne/~r aacites, reU'Ol~-itoneal lymph node swelling, nor other metastatic lesions was observed in the ixeolmmive examinations. HAtS was decided to perform, because we could not diagnose whether this tumor was malignant or not, ~mmy or metastatic, l.~oeroso~c p~edures were ped'ormed with the surgeon's left hand through the 7cm skin incision and lafamscopic coagulating shears. We ckl not use the metal clips to cut the vessels. The splenic vessels were divided using vascular stapl~ By the palpation of the left hand, the swollen regional lymph node was also n:sec~.

Statistical analysis was performed utilizing Fisher's Exact test for qualitative data, Mann-Whitney test for continuous non-parametric variables, and Student t-test for continuous parametric variables; p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: There were 88 patients in Group I and 101 in Group II. There were no differences in gender between the two groups (10=0.15) and the procedures were well stratified. Operations performed included dght hemicolectomy: 55 and 63, left hemicolectomy: 5 and 8, sigmoidectomy: 29 and 30 in Groups I and II, respectively. There was no difference in the incidence of previous abdominal surgery between the two groups. The most prevalent indications for surgery were neoplasia in Group I and Crohn's disease in Group I1. Significantly more patients in Group I1 than in Group I had higher (111 and IV) ASA scores (19~ vs 50%;p<0.0001). There were no statistical significances between the two groups relative to the incidence of conversion (11% vs 15%;IO==0.52), intraoperative complications (6% vs 7%;p=0.77), postoperative complications (37% vs 43%;p---0.66), operative times (169 vs 175 min.; 10=0.55), estimated blood loss (182 vs 213 ml; p--0.57), time to return of bowel function (4.2 vs 4.6 days; p=0.17), or length of hospitalization (6.8 vs 7.4 days; p=0.17).Conclusion: Despite higher ASA scores in eldedy patients the outcomes were comparable to those in younger patients. Surgical robots have been introduced to provide more precise and steady control of camera. We aimed to compare commemially available robotic camera holders Aesop (manual, voice and memory modes, Computer Motion,USA), Endoassist (Armstrong, England),lmagtrac (Olympus, Japan) with the conventional human control. A single examiner conducted the study in surgical training boxes with standard laparoscopic equipment. Unear (upwards, downwards, sideways and diagonal) in and out, and complex three dimensional movements were assessed by using standardized distances and tests. The time required to achieve each task was measured assuming that the more precise and accurate the movements of the robot were, the shorter the time it would take to perform the tasks. Linear regression analysis and Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni corecction was used accordingly. In all type movements human control provided the best camera control. In linear movements, Aesop manual control and Imagtrac were the quickest among all; whereas voice and memory modes of Aesop and Endoassist were relatively slower. Conceming in and out movements Imagtrac was the most effective and closest to human control (p<0.05). In complex three dimensional movements the memory mode of Aesop was supenor to other types (p<0.05) and it was followed by manual control of Aesop and tmagtrac.The human control of the camera is still the best option regarding to time required to achieve each movement; whereas the quality of vision is poor due to movements of the scope. On the other hand, among the robotic systems the manual mode of Aesop and Imagtrac were efficient and precise compared to the other robotic arms. Background: The aim of this study was to compare early and more recent results of laparoscopic colorectal surgery to assess any differences in indications or procedures as well as any changes in results.Methods: All patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery were prospectively entered in a laparoscopic database. Group 1 included individuals operated upon between August 1991 and December 1995 while Group II included January 1996 to September 1999.Results: 364 patients underwent elective laparoscopic surgery including 175 patients in Group I and 199 patients in Group I1. While them were no differences between the two groups relative to gender, patients in Group II were significantly older [50.3+19.5 (range 15-89) years; p<0.001]. In addiUon, significan T more patients in Group I than in Group II had undergone total abdominal colectomy or restorative proctocolectomy (17% vs 2%;p<0.01) for either mucosal ulcerative colitis (19% vs 2%;p<0.01) or constipation (7% vs 2.5%;p<0.05). Conversely, the number of patients who underwent nght hemicolectomy increased from Group I to Group II (24.5% vs 39.7~ mostly due to an increase in terminal ileal Crohn's disease (18.8% vs 26.6%). Despite the fact that there was an increase from Group I to Group II in the number of patients who had adhesions (25% vs 51%;p<0.001), the conversion rate decreased (22% vs 14%;p<0.01) as did the intraoperative complication rate (16% vs 4.5%;p<0.01) and the operative time (181 vs 154 min; p<0.01).Conclusion: Increasing experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery may have lead to better case selection with the performance of less total abdominal colectomias and restorative prectocolectomies and more segmental nght colectomias. Thus, despite an increasing need to perform enterolys~s, both the conversion rate and the intraoperative complication rate decreased as did the operate time. Objective: The FDA has recently approved clinical use of the da Vinci robot for general abdominal surgery. We will present results from our initial series of ten patients. Methods: Patients with indications for elective Nissen fundoplication were offered the option of a robotic procedure. Exclusion criteria included patients with large hiatal hernias, multiple prior abdominal surgeries, and severe dysmotility. Operative times and details are compared to standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Results: Five patients have undergone Nissen fundoplications using a robotic assisted technique, the remainder are scheduled in the coming weeks. Robotic operative time averaged 1.4 hours (range 1.2 to 1.8 hours). To date, no conversions or complications have occurred in either group. Patient satisfaction has been high in each group. Conclusions: Robotic Nissen fundoplication is a feasible alternative to the standard laparoscopic technique. We have found the robotic system easily understood and its operation quickly learned. While the optical system has improvements over conventional laparoscopy, tactile feedback is lacking. Continued development of computer assisted technology and instrument refinement should improve the technique. Background: Exposure to a carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum used in laparoscopic surgery can increase the occurrence of peritoneal metastases; for this to occur cells must attach to the mesothelium. We therefore analysed the effect of a carbon dioxide pneumopedtoneum on tumour cell / mesothelium interactions and mesothelia] cell surface expression. Methods: Pdmary cultures of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) were derived from omental samples. Monolayers of HPMC ceils were exposed to either an in vitro carbon dioxide (CO2) or helium (He) pneumoperitoneum for 4 hours or left under normal growth conditions (control). Colonic (SW1222) adenocarcinoma cells ability to adhere to the monolayer was assessed. In parallel w~ these study alterations in mesothelial cell surface expression of avB3 and av integrin were analysed. Conclusions: Exposure to either a carbon dioxide or helium pneumoperitoneum causes an increase in the ability of tumour cells to adhere to mesothelium. This indicates a mechanism of how the operative environment influences tumour growth. Goal of this study was to prove these reported advantages. Methods:",

            "text": "The first 25 laparoscopic hernia repairs performed in our clinic were compared with 25 historic controls that were operated using an open technique. Only open repairs using a pdmary closure of the hemia with a madex onlay were used as controls. They were matched for age, sex, BMI and ASA status. The hernia sizes were comparable, as was theil operative history. Results: Conversion to conventional repair was necessary in 2 patients of the laparoscopic group. In the laparoscopic group the mean operating time was significantly longer (93 min vs 72 min). On the other hand the mean hospital stay was significantly shorter (6.1 vs 7,4 days; p=0.044). There were more short and long term complications in the open group. ThE number of recurrences was higher in the open group (4 vs 1). Howevel the mean follow up in the laparoscopic group is only 9 months. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the earlier mentioned advantages of the laparoscop. ic approach. It also confirms the disadvantage of a longer mean operative time. Another problem concerns the much higher operative costs. Ou~ plan is to perform a prospective randomized study to compare these ; methods. In this study we will also compare whether the total costs of th~ laparoscopic repair are lower than of the open method due to a shortel hospital stay and a lower recurrence rate. Objective: Assessment and localization of colonic pathology may bE more difficult in laparoscopic surgery as palpation of the specimen is diffi cult, and perception may be distorted. Therefore, the aim of this stud~ was to assess the use of intra--operative lower endoscopy for evaluatJor of the colon in laparoscopic colorectai surgery.",

            "text": "Methods: A retrospective chart review of the patients who underwen segmental colonic resection with primary anastomosis was perfon'ned t( determine the rate and charactedstios of the use of intraoperative Iowe endoscopy. The results were compared to a group of open colectomie., matched by surgeon and procedure.Results: 233 patients had laparoscopic segmental colon resection an( anastomosis between 1991 and 2000. Intaoperative lower endoscop,. was used in 24% (n=57) of these patients, compared to 18% in the opel matched group. In the laparoscopic group, intaoperative Iowe endoscopy was performed in 42% (n=101) of the patients in whom tht pathology was located in the sigmoid colon or rectum, compared to 119 of the patients with pathology proximal to the sigmoid colon, or encom passing the entire colon. The main indication for intaoperative Iowe endoscopy was to assess or localize the pathology in Co4~ rule out syn chromous pathologies in 8%, and asses an anastomosis in 27% However, 42% of the patients had more then one intaoperative Iowe endoscopy during their laparoscopic case. The information gathered fron intaoperative lower endoscopy was judged to directly influence the ope; ative decisions and management in 71% of the patients and provide reassuring information in the rest of the cases.Conclusions: Lower endoscopy is a useful tool for the intaoperatiw assessment of colonic pathotog;es and anastomoses in Japaroscopi, colon resections. These results suggest that surgeons performing laparc scopic colorectai surgery may benefit having the expertise of performin! lower endoscopy. Purpose:There has been confusion and debate regarding the value added by the incorporation of flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy into a general surgery practice. The purpose of this study was to assess the economic impact of flexible endoscopy performed by general surgeons in a large group practice setting. Methods:Total practice size was 11 surgeons, 3 of which performed flexible endoscopy on a regular basis as well as traditional surgical cases. Based on a retospective review of billing records for the calender year 1999, the total amount billed for all surgical procedures was compared to billing for flexible endoscopy. Two of the three endosurgeons performed colonoscopies and EGD's in addition to their open and laparoscopic surgeries, while the third performed ERCP as well. Results:There were a total of eleven surgeons in the practice, three of whom performed endoscopy in addition to other surgical procedures. The total percentage of billed income for the department attributable to endoscopy was 12.2% The three endosurgeons contributed 29% to the total gross billings of the department. We previously prospectively evaluated the effects of pneumoperitoneum and patient position on hemodynamics during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and found that patient position had no effect on Cardiac Index (CI), Stroke volume (SV) and Left Ventdcular End Diastolic Volume (LVEDV). Analysis of that data showed that the adverse hemodynamic changes associated with anethesthesia and pneumoperitoneum were short lived with values tiending towards baseline during the operative peried. The purpose of this study was to examine the duration of negative hemodynamic effects during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Thirty-eight patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystecomy by a single surgeon were enrolled in the study. Hemodynamic data was collected via a trans-thoracic bioimpedance monitor (IQ, Renaissance Technology). Baseline readings of were taken prior to establishing pneumoperitoneum. Data was the collected continuously over the course of each case. Patients were compared to their baseline value. Data was analyzed every 5 minutes with the paired t-test used to determine statistical significance.Baseline was defined as the point prior to insufflation. With insufflation to 15 mm Hg CO2, CI fell from a baseline value of 2.82 UmWrn2 to 2.66 Umin/m2 ( p = 0.04), SV from71.58 ml to 65.44 ml ( p = 0.002) and LVEDV from 111.46 ml to 102.68 ml ( p = 0.003) At 5 minutes, all values were further depressed. At 10 minutes all values were no longer significentiy different from baseline with CI 2.78 L/min/rn2 (p = 0.76), SV 67.42 ml (p = 0.14) and LVEDV 102.26 ml (p = 0.179). Values reached those at baseline at 15 minutes and did not waiver for remainder of each case or the next 35 minutes.Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecysteotomy undergo significant hemodynamic depression with pneumoparitoneum. These hemodynamic changes are short-lived and loose their statistical significance at 10 minutes from the time a patient undergoes pneumoperitoneum.",
