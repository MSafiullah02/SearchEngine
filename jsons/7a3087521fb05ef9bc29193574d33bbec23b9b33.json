On the other hand, HNEC co-cultured with activated T cells produced CXCL10 at a level several orders of magnitude higher than that induced by HRV14. Albeit to a much lower degree, activated T cells also induced CXCL8, IL-6 and NOS2. Anti-IFNc antibodies and TNF soluble receptor completely blocked CXCL10 upregulation. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between epithelial CXCL10 mRNA expression and the amounts of IFNc and TNF secreted by T cells. Likewise, increasing numbers of T cells to a constant number of HNEC in co-cultures resulted in increasing epithelial CXCL10 production, attaining a plateau at high IFNc and TNF levels. Hence, HNEC activation by T cells is induced mainly by IFNc and/or TNF. Activated T cells also markedly inhibited viral replication in HNEC, partially through activation of the nitric oxide pathway.",

They can be caused by a variety of different viruses including coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial viruses but infection with rhinoviruses (HRV) of the Picornaviridae family is predominant [1] . The antiviral response depends on the rapid production of interferons (IFNs), which are classified as type 1 IFNs (IFNa/b) and type 2 IFN (IFNc) based on the receptor complex used for signalling as well as on their sequence homology [2, 3] . Almost every nucleated cell produces IFNa/b when infected by a virus, whereas IFNc is mainly produced by T cells and NK cells. IFNa/ b mount robust host responses against viruses by inducing a wide variety of antiviral proteins including ribonucleases that digest viral double stranded RNA, and the antiviral protein kinase PKR which induces apoptosis. Inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) is also an important component of the innate immune response [4, 5] , as it exerts direct antiviral activity by nitrolysating key thiol residues in viral proteases.",

In vitro infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinovirus induces the production of a wide range of antiviral molecules including INFb [6, 7] , b-defensins [8, 9] as well as NOS2 [10] , or proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines that attract and activate cells of the immune system, including CXCL8, CXCL5, CXCL10, CCL5 and IL-6 [11] [12] [13] . During HRV infections in vivo, levels of epithelial NOS2 induction correlate with levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), and subjects with the highest levels of exhaled NO clear the virus more rapidly and have fewer symptoms [14] . CXCL8 and IL-6 are present in nasal secretions and sputum of HRV-infected individuals [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

This might be due to the lack of type 1 IFNs and NO responses, two systems known to block the spread of virus infection. Indeed, we did not observe induction of IFNb and NOS2 mRNA expression in HNEC, and did not detect IFNb protein and NO in the extracellular media 40 h after HRV14 infection in the absence of activated T cells. Our inability to detect up-regulation of the genes important in antiviral defense cannot be ascribed to insufficient infection of HNEC since the viral dose used in our study did allow productive infection of HNEC. Of note, this viral dose is 5 times higher than that usually employed in experimental inoculation studies, reported to be effective in inducing significant cold symptoms [20, 24, 25] . Hence our observation in nasal epithelial cells differ from those previously reported for bronchial epithelial cells [27] . This may be related to the degree of infection, the cell's origin (upper or lower airways) and/ or differentiation status. Of note, highly polarized cells like those used in our study were reported to be much less susceptible to virus infection [28] . In addition, no significant induction of the neutrophil attractant CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was observed in our cells following HRV14 challenge, which is in accordance with data obtained with fully differentiated epithelial cells grown with an air-liquid interface [28] , but in contrast with those obtained with undifferentiated tracheal/ bronchial primary epithelial cells or cell lines grown as submerged monolayers [11] [12] [13] . We did observe a consistent and significant induction of mRNA and secreted protein of CXCL10, a potent chemo-attractant for T cells. This observation supports the current opinion that epithelial cells are the primary source of CXCL10 during HRV infection. It has been reported that CXCL10 production increased in airway epithelium after in vivo and in vitro HRV infection [6, [29] [30] [31] , in airway secretions during symptomatic in vivo HRV infections, and in serum of asthmatic patients during virus-induced exacerbations [32] . Taken altogether, our results show that apart from CXCL10, HRV infection by itself did not induce significant antiviral and inflammatory responses in fully differentiated airway epithelial cells with intact tight junctions.",

The effect was particularly strong for CXCL10, thousands times greater than that induced by HRV14. Epithelial CXCL10 induction is mediated by T cells derived soluble factors because activated T cells were not in direct contact with HNEC in our cocultures. Our data obtained with neutralizing antibodies, T cell clones secreting different IFNc and TNF amounts, and increasing numbers of T cells, clearly indicate that IFNc and TNF were the main inducers of epithelial CXCL10. Our observation that Figure 6 . Epithelial CXCL10 protein secreted into the basolateral compartment increases with increasing T cells numbers and increasing IFNc and TNF amounts, reaching a plateau at high concentrations.A constant number of HNEC (0.5610 6 cells) was co-cultured with increasing numbers of activated T cells (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5610 6 cells). CXCL10 protein amounts secreted by HNEC into the basolateral media are expressed as a function of the numbers of T cells in co-cultures (A) and the amounts of IFNc (B) and TNF (C) secreted by increasing numbers of T cells. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026293.g006 epithelial CXCL10 production attained a plateau at high IFNc and TNF concentrations points to saturation of IFNc/TNF receptors. However, recombinant IFNc and TNF added as a single bolus at concentrations (50 ng/ml) equivalent or greater than those secreted by high numbers of T cells induced only a modest increase in epithelial CXCL10 mRNA expression. This might be due to the fact that exogenously added cytokines are short-lived in the culture media while in co-cultures, cytokines are continuously produced by activated T cells. Of note, exogenous TNF added alone had no effect (data not shown) implicating that in co-cultures the stimulating effect of TNF on epithelial CXCL10 might be mediated through INFc induced by TNF. Taken altogether these data highlight the importance of continuous interactions between immune and epithelial cells resulting in uninterrupted production of cytokines to maintain transduction signals for host responses. The observed additive effects of IFNc and TNF on CXCL10 suggest that more than one signaling pathway was involved, similar to signaling in human monocytes [33] and airway smooth muscle cells [34] . By contrast, the effects of IFNc and TNF on NOS2 are not additive, suggesting that they might act on similar transduction pathways. Furthermore, IFNc and TNF were only partially effective in inducing epithelial NOS2, indicating that other soluble factors were required.",

In the latter work, epithelial cells were submerged undifferentiated cultures, and in direct contact with HRV16 and monocytes [31] . As such, this experimental system is most likely representative of severe in vivo infection conditions with immune cells infiltrating the mucosa. Our experimental model of polarized airway epithelial cells cultured on semi-permeable membrane and separated from activated T cells is more appropriate to study early interactions through soluble factors when the epithelium is still intact after a mild HRV infection.",

A role for type 1 IFNs can be ruled out as we detected no increase in IFNb gene expression in infected HNEC co-incubated with T cells (data not shown). In contrast, NO is involved in viral clearance, since in most cases when NO production is inhibited HRV14 RNA levels are higher in infected HNEC. This is in keeping with clinical observations reporting that patients with high levels of exhaled NO clear virus more rapidly and have lower symptom scores [14] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, except for CXCL10, highly differentiated human airway epithelial cells are quite unresponsive to low level of HRV infection in terms of antiviral and inflammatory responses, which become largely significant in the presence of activated T cells. It is expectable that a mild viral infection of the mucosal epithelium in vivo promotes further airway inflammation by triggering epithelial CXCL10 production, allowing accumulation of activated T lymphocytes which in turn enhance epithelial chemokines and cytokines production. On the other hand, activated T cells recruited to the site of infection help epithelial cells to clear viruses through production of IFNc and TNF, and induction of epithelial NOS2 expression. Consequently, epithelial cells are important effector cells in immune response and activated T lymphocytes are a major player in HRV-induced airway inflammation by linking innate and adaptive immunity. . Activated T cells inhibit virus replication in infected HNEC partially through the NO pathway. HNEC were exposed apically to HRV14, washed thoroughly then co-cultured with activated T cells in the presence or absence of FP and L-NIL, inhibitors of NOS2 mRNA and activity, respectively. (A) NO secretion in the basolateral compartment and (B) viral RNA levels. NO is expressed as nitrite, the stable oxidation product of NO (mM). Viral RNAs was measured by real-time PCR and expressed as fold change relative to those observed in infected HNEC cultured in the absence of activated T cells. *p,0.05 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026293.g007",
