The entire itinerary for the trip should be reviewed, including destinations, time and duration of travel, types of accommodation, activities, and potential exposure to insects and animals. The evaluation also should review the medical and particularly the immunization history of the child in order to ensure that appropriate advice is given regarding preventive measures, including necessary vaccines. This evaluation can be accomplished by providing a form for parents to complete and bring to the initial pretravel assessment visit. Particular attention should be given to children of immigrants who are returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives because these children have been shown to be at increased risk of many infectious diseases and may be less likely to seek pretravel advice.6, 7, 8 Many excellent resources, the majority of which are accessible online, provide pretravel advice for pediatricians (Box 8-1\n).Box 8-1Resources and Additional Information for Travelers\n\u2022\nInternational Travel and Health, print version updated biannually, online version updated regularly by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Skin protection is an important topic and includes both risk of serious sunburn and avoidance of infectious diseases. For sunblock, 30 is the minimum sun protection factor (SPF) recommended for children. Sunblock should be applied 30 minutes before exposure and always before insect repellent is applied where both are needed. Adolescent travelers should be counseled regarding safer sex practices and risks of body piercing and tattooing in less developed countries. Fresh water exposure of any kind should be avoided in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis or where Leptospira organisms can contaminate the water. Exposure to infected stool of animals or humans can result in several types of parasitic infection either directly (e.g., hookworm) or through fecal\u2013oral exposure (e.g., Toxocara spp.). Shoes provide more protection than sandals for children exposed to contaminated environments. Animal bites can result in injury, bacterial infection at the site, or rabies; therefore, children should be cautioned to avoid unknown animals, particularly dogs, while traveling. Since disposable diapers may not be available in some countries, parents should be aware that cloth diapers must be ironed after washing to kill eggs and larvae deposited on clothing by the tumbu fly, the vector of myiasis, in parts of Africa.",

Measles and varicella-containing vaccines should be deferred from 3 to 11 months after IG administration depending on the indication and dose of IG required (see Chapter 5, Passive Immunization). Although the effect of IG administration on the immunogenicity of varicella vaccine is unknown, the current recommendation is to use the same guidelines for varicella vaccine and IG as are used for measles-containing vaccines.21 IG administration does not interfere with the immune response to yellow fever, oral polio virus (OPV), rotavirus vaccines, or any inactivated vaccines.

Pre-exposure rabies immunization is recommended for travelers with an occupational risk of exposure, for people planning extended stays in endemic areas where medical care is limited, and for outdoor travelers.47 Given that children are more likely to interact with animals and not report an animal bite, rabies pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for children traveling to endemic countries for at least 1 month. The pre-exposure vaccine is 3 doses of 1.0 mL each given intramuscularly at 0, 7, and 21 or 28 days.47 The series can be administered using either of the two licensed vaccines in the U.S.: human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV), or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV). If a vaccinated child is bitten or sustains a skin-penetrating scratch by a potentially rabid animal, the wound must be washed thoroughly and 2 additional doses must be completed as soon as possible (given 3 days apart); rabies IG is not required.48 Without pre-exposure immunization, rabies IG and 4 doses of an approved vaccine (given over 14 days) are required in the U.S. Current WHO recommendations are for 5 intramuscular or intradermal doses of vaccine.49 (Note: rabies IG is often not available in many developing countries.)",

A recent study found that half an adult dose of JE-VC was safe and immunogenic in children ages 1\u20133 years.5lb Therefore, off-label use of JE-VC may be considered with an adult dose of the vaccine above 3 years and half a dose from 1 to 3 years. Two doses of JE-VC are given 1 month apart with the series being completed at least 1 week prior to travel. The duration of immunity is unknown. A booster dose of JE-VC may be given one year after the two dose primary series.",
