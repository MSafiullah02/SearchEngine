            "text": "Within the last 20 years, betanodaviruses have emerged as major pathogens of teleosts, causing disease in several marine and freshwater species (reviewed in Munday, Kwang & Moody 2002). Betanodaviruses are the aetiological agents of viral nervous necrosis (VNN), a disease characterized by vacuolation of the encephalon and retina and the presence of virus particles within infected neurones. VNN is associated with extensive mortalities that may approach 100% in severe cases. Betanodavirus infection has been reported in more than 35 fish species belonging to 10 different orders including Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), amberjack, Seriola dumerili (Risso), groupers, Epinephelus spp. and barramundi, Lates calcarifer Bloch (Glazebrook, Heasman & Beer 1990; Mori, Nakai, Nagahara, Muroga, Mekuchi & Kanno 1991; Renault, Haffner, Baudin\u2010Laurencin, Breuil & Bonami 1991; Nakai, Nguyen, Nishizawa, Muroga, Arimoto & Ootsuki 1994; Fukuda, Nguyen, Furuhashi & Nakai 1996; Chi, Lo, Kou, Chang, Peng & Chen 1997; Starkey, Ireland, Muir, Jenkins, Roy, Richards & Ferguson 2001; Johnson, Sperker, Leggiadro, Groman, Griffiths, Ritchie, Cook & Cusack 2002; Ucko, Colorni & Diamant 2004). Many of the species affected by VNN are of economic importance to the aquaculture industry.",

            "text": "Betanodaviruses are icosahedral viruses with a diameter of 23 nm (Breuil, Bonami, P\u00e9pin & Pichot 1991). The betanodavirus genome is bipartite, comprising two single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA molecules with Mr of 1.01 \u00d7 106 Da (RNA1) and 0.49 \u00d7 106 Da (RNA2) (Mori, Nakai, Muroga, Arimoto, Mushiake & Furusawa 1992). RNA1 encodes a 100\u2010kDa protein representing the viral component of the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase. RNA2 encodes the 42 kDa coat protein precursor (Nagai & Nishizawa 1999). A subgenomic transcript of RNA1, designated as RNA3, is also expressed in infected cells (Sommerset & Nerland 2004). Betanodaviruses are genetically diverse, and have been classified into four genotypes based on the nucleotide sequence of the coat protein gene (Nishizawa, Furuhashi, Nagai, Nakai & Muroga 1997). A betanodavirus with a distinct coat protein nucleotide sequence potentially representing a novel genotype was isolated from sea bass in France (Thi\u00e9ry, Arnauld & Delsert 1999).",

However, established mapping procedures have not been used to characterize epitopes in betanodaviruses. In this study, we have used the pepscan procedure (Geysen, Meloen & Barteling 1984) to identify betanodavirus B cells recognized by serum samples from betanodavirus\u2010infected fish, and by anti\u2010betanodavirus mouse MAbs.",

Correlation between B\u2010cell epitopes identified in antibody\u2010based mapping studies, and epitopes predicted by the method of Kolaskar & Tongaonkar has also been noted for SARS coronavirus (He, Zhou, Wu, Kou, Liu & Jiang 2004). The putative antigenic domain identified on the betanodavirus capsid protein by the method of Kolaskar & Tongaonkar spans residues 193\u2013212 and comprises the amino acid sequence DVVNVSVLCRWSVRLSVPSL. Interestingly, capsid protein residues 193\u2013212 fall within the highly conserved region identified by Nishizawa, Mori, Furuhashi, Nakai, Furusawa & Muroga (1995), and are conserved in 69 of 78 betanodavirus capsid protein sequences deposited on the UniProt database (http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/index.shtml). These include viruses isolated from more than 25 species of fish including halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus (L.), Atlantic cod, Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (Temminck & Schlegel), sea bass, dragon grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus (Bloch), barfin flounder, Verasper moseri Jordan & Gilbert, turbot, Psetta maxima (L.), guppy Poecilia reticulata Peters, tiger puffer, Takifugu rubripes (Temminck & Schlegel), haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus (L.), and flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus L. Five other betanodaviruses on the Uniprot database contain a single amino acid substitution within residues 181\u2013212 where the class of substituted amino acid is conserved. Three further viruses isolated from striped jack and sea bass contain a lys\u2010met substitution at residue 200, and one virus isolated from sea bass contains an ala\u2010arg substitution at residue 196. It is possible that immune selection has influenced sequence variation in the region of the nodavirus genome that encodes coat protein residues 181\u2013212.",

            "text": "The results of the present study should be interpreted with caution when applied to the development of nodavirus vaccines. Firstly, the epitopes identified in pepscan analyses represent those recognized by MAbs or serum samples with the greatest MFI values. However, these epitopes could function as immunological decoys, such as those identified on human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 (Neurath, Strick & Lee 1990) and glycoprotein gp5 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Fang, Jiang, Xiao, Niu, Zhang & Chen 2006). Secondly, the short 12\u2010mer peptides used for mapping mimic linear epitopes are formed by contiguous stretches of amino acids. Consequently, they cannot detect antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes formed by complex three\u2010dimensional protein folding. Many neutralizing antibodies that recognize viral structural proteins are directed against conformational epitopes (Wolinsky, McCarthy, Allen\u2010Cannady, Moore, Jin, Cao, Lovett & Simmons 1991). However, linear epitopes identified in mapping studies have successfully been used to inform the design of viral vaccines and immunodiagnostic reagents (Langeveld, Casal, Osterhaus, Cortes, de Swart, Vela, Dalsgaard, Puijk, Schaaper & Meloen 1994; Wang, Chang, Walfield, Ye, Shen, Zhang, Lubroth, Chen, Li, Lin, Jong, Yang, Chyr, Kramer & Brown 2001). Thus, the results of the present study highlight regions of the betanodavirus capsid protein that might serve as vaccine components with the objective of inducing protective immune responses. This experimentally testable hypothesis will be the subject of future investigation.",
