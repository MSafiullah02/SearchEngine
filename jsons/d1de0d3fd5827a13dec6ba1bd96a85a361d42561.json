            "text": "In the past few decades there have been increased investigations into the effects of captive environments on behavior. Simultaneously, zoological gardens have undergone a revolution in philosophy and design, resulting in a proliferation of \"naturalistic\" habitats. Complex environments such as these have been found to affect the behavior of captive animals favorably, including increasing reproductive and rearing success, encouraging the expression of species-typical behavior patterns, and decreasing abnonnal behaviors. In June 1988, Zoo Atlanta completed four naturalistic habitats for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla go-rilla}. These new habitats afforded a unique opportunity to study the adaptation of lowland gorillas to novel, naturalistic habitats. During the first year of habitation, a total of 451 hours of data were collected on 11 gorillas housed in three harem groups. Focal animal sampling with a behavioral change scoring system was used to obtain information on behavior, substrate, environmental components utilized, and location in sun or shade. Instantaneous scans at 15 minute intervals provided information on location and behavior of all individuals. Adaptation to the environments was assessed by using the indices of time spent manipulating objects across the course of the study, the percent of the habitats utilized, and the dispersal of individual animals over the habitats. Trends in these behaviors indicated that exploration of the environments significantly decreased, but that this decline in exploration took over six months to occur. Several interpretations of these findings are presented including the unfamiliarity of these naturalistic habitats to these subjects.",

The effects on behavior of deprived environments, such as those described by Harlow and his students [e.g., Harlow and Harlow, 19621 , are well-known. These effects include reductions in the exhibition of species-typical behaviors and accompanying increases in the exhibition of stereotypiciabnormal behaviors [e.g., Erwin and Deni, 19791. At least three reasons can be listed for identifying methods to improve the quality of captive environments: First, the new USDA regulations regarding psychological well-being in captive primates encourage us to learn more about providing adequate environments for these species [Animal Welfare Act Amendments, 19851 . Second, a factor of relevance primarily for zoological gardens is that exhibit animals should behave and be housed in ways that will most effectively educate zoo visitors [Finlay et al., 19881 . And last, of critical importance is increasing the expression of those behaviors associated with successful breeding and parenting. Beck and Power [ 19891 concluded that the majority of reproductive failures in captive gorillas are due to deficits in sexual behavior rather than to physiological factors.",

            "text": "Deficiencies in the social environment have been clearly linked to subsequent inadequacies in sexual behavior and parental care. In particular, the presence of both the mother and conspecifics during rearing positively affects the probability of future reproductive success [e.g., Harlow and Harlow, 1962; Beck and Power, 19891 . Physical variables of captive environments have also been shown to affect behavior, most notably reproductive behavior. Complex exhibits, which include most naturalistic exhibits, have been found to be related to positive behavioral outcomes in great apes. Miller-Schroeder and Paterson [ 19891 conducted a survey of successful reproduction and parental behavior in lowland gorillas and related environmental variables. A discriminant analysis revealed that several aspects of complex physical environments (e.g., visual cover, provision of natural vegetation) were related to appropriate breeding behavior and to successful parenting. Complex exhibits are also associated with alteration in activity to levels typical for the species [Wilson, 19821, reduction in stereotypic or abnormal behaviors [Akers and Schildkraut, 1985; Clarke et al., 1982; Erwin and Deni, 1979; Goerke et al., 1987; Gould and Bres, 1986; Pfeiffer and Koebner, 19781 , and encouragement of species-typical levels of aggressive and affiliative behaviors [Maple and Stine, 1982; but cf. Clarke et al., 1982; Goerke et al., 19871 . Additionally, animals have been found to prefer complex, naturalistic exhibits over sterile alternatives when enclosure size is held constant [Timson, 1978; cited in Shettel-Neuber, 19881 . A current proliferation of naturalistic habitats in zoos across the world encourages us to further investigate the specific effects of such complex habitats.",

The pattern of decline in object manipulation was similar across the three groups, but there were differences in degree. Group 1 exhibited more object manipulation than did the other groups. As shown in Table 2 , the adult male in Group 1 was the only male to engage in a substantial amount of manipulation, with a mean manipulation time of approximately 30 seconds per 15 minute focal sample, compared to approximately 2 seconds per focal sample for the other two males. Similarly, the adult females in Group I exhibited more manipulation than did females in the other groups.

It was expected that the subjects would at first exhibit a high level of exploration, gradually declining as a function of days in the enclosure. The present data did not completely conform to this expectation. Instead, the data indicated slow onset of exploratory behavior, a longer than expected period of stabilization of exploration, followed by significant declines. The slow onset of exploratory behavior is indicated by the initially low levels of object manipulation (see Fig. 3 ) and by high clumping during the first quarter of the study (see Fig. 5 ) . The stabilization of exploratory behavior is indicated by the fact that object manipulation, once begun, did not decrease until six months into the study (see Fig. 3 ). Figures 3 and 5 demonstrate the dramatic declines in object manipulation and increased clumping seen in the third and fourth quarters. As an additional indicator of overall low exploration, a large portion of the exhibits remained unexplored for each subject; in the case of the males in Groups 2 and 3 , this figure reaches a dramatic 40% (see Fig. 4 ). Finally, several of the animals (including the males in Groups 2 and 3 , and one adult female in Group 2) showed virtually no object manipulation. These results converge to suggest a period of initial caution, followed by limited exploration for approximately the first six months of habitation, that then declined fairly dramatically. Many potential explanations for these combined findings exist, including: 1) a lessened availability of objects to manipulate; 2) the continual novelty provided by naturalistic exhibits; 3 ) species-typical exploratory tendencies; 4) age of the subjects; 5 ) habituation, or a determination of functional utility; and 6) \"neophobia,\" or fear of novel areas, or, possibly relatedly, inappropriate responses to such environments. Each of these explanations will be considered in turn.",

Although the number of branches may have decreased as the gorillas dismantled saplings, this destruction should have resulted in a concomitant increase in the number of sticks.

A \"functional\" hypothesis may be related to the habituation hypothesis; that is, the gorillas may have determined which locations have the most utility to them, and thus are not exploring additional locations. Exploratory behavior is presumed to provide the animal with information about the environment which is important for survival (e.g., foraging sites, resting sites, environmental hazards) [Birke and Archer, 19831 . Increased clumping and preference for the holding area quadrats may reflect that the animals have located those areas most useful to them, and have little need to venture beyond them. This would suggest that the animals are not necessarily unaware of the novelty the remaining unentered areas represent, nor are necessarily avoiding them, but that they are not compelled to explore those areas. This explanation is not supported by the increased dispersal seen in Group 1 during the last quarter.",

All of these gorillas have been reared in smaller, less complex environments than the present naturalistic zoo exhibits. Although these environments are ecologically appropriate for this species, these individuals have spent the majority of their lives in simpler environments. These data therefore may indicate that the naturalistic environments are intensely novel to these subjects, and may reflect a kind of \"neophobia\" [Russell, 19831. Neophobia may additionally account for the dramatic increase in exploration. The cessation in exploration may be due in part to an unwillingness to enter areas of heightened novelty; the remaining unentered quadrats may be unexplored because they possess aversive or unfamiliar characteristics (e.g., steep hills, or edges adjoining moats).",

Chimpanzees raised in restricted environments have also been found to be \"retarded\" in their responses to novel objects, although less so than rats [Menzel et al., 19631. Several results of the present study support this neophobia hypothesis. First and foremost is the greater amount of exploratory behavior observed in those animals previously housed in a large outdoor area (Group 1). The other groups had previously been housed only in smaller, less complex, caged environments; we do not suggest that these environments were as restrictive as those in the studies described above [e.g., Renner, 1987; Menzel et al., 19631;  however, this experience may predispose the animals to feel more \"comfortable\" in a certain kind of environment. This greater amount of exploratory behavior is indicated by the fact that the animals in Group 1 spent more time engaged in object manipulation. (See Table 2 ; although this result was not significant, this may be due to the low power of the required test.) Furthermore, this group continued to show increased dispersal, or exploration, over the habitats, whereas the other groups showed increased clumping. Finally, Group 1 had entered a greater percentage of the available habitat, leaving an average of 17% unentered, compared with 26% and 23% for Groups 2 and 3, respectively.",

The largest between-group disparity in unentered quadrats is found in males, with the male of Group 1 leaving 20% unentered, compared with 40% and 41% unentered in Groups 2 and 3. Additionally, as seen in Table 2 , the males in Groups 2 and 3 show virtually no object manipulation, whereas the females in these groups do engage in this behavior, albeit not at the level of the females in Group 1. Similarly, the males in Groups 2 and 3 have entered a smaller percentage of the available quadrats as compared to the females, whereas the differences between the male and females in Group 1 are not as striking. These sex differences are suggestive of sex differences typically found following environmental restriction. For example, male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) demonstrate much greater inhibition of responses to novel stimuli than do females [Sackett, 19721, and this effect has also been found in other primate species [Mitchell, 19791. In addition to the group differences, a finding in support of a neophobia hypothesis is the fact that in all but two individuals, the highest frequency of usage was observed in areas adjoining the holding building. This usage is meaningfully predicted by temporal and climatic factors in only one group, and even in that group a sizable amount of the variance remains unaccounted for. Russell [ 19831 distinguishes between novelty paradigms wherein subjects are placed in wholly novel areas vs. those in which subjects are given access to a new area adjacent to a familiar one. These holding area quadrats may represent more \"familiar\" environments to the animals. First, they have characteristics which are similar to the holding areas in which the animals are both housed at night and in which they were held in quarantine prior to their release into the outdoor habitats. Additionally, these quadrats are representative of the housing experiences of the animals prior to their transfer to the zoo. This is true even in the case of Group 1; although these animals had previous experience in a large environment, the majority of their lives had been spent in less complex enclosures. Russell [1983] suggested that time spent in familiar areas represents a return to a \"safer\" zone; these data support such an interpretation.",

Information derived from studying the exploratory behavior of infants recently born in these exhibits may shed light on the effects of restricted environments. However, the tendencies of the individual infants may be superseded by the controlling role played by adult male gorillas [see Hoff et al., 19821 .
