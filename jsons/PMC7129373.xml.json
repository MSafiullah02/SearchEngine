Such therapies are often associated with adverse reactions involving the innate immune system, which under physiological conditions is an important participant in our immediate defense against alien/foreign substances such as microorganisms. In a similar manner, the reactive surfaces of medical equipment as well as the surfaces of transplanted cells or solid organs will trigger an innate immune response, orchestrating a thrombotic/inflammatory reaction that ultimately results in a poor outcome of the therapy and/or damage to the host.",

These initial triggers induce activation of the cellular systems of the blood: platelets, subpopulations of leukocytes within the innate branch of the immune system, and the endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels. There are multiple points of interaction or cross-talk between the humoral and cellular portions of the innate immune system, meaning that a moderate initial activating signal can be rapidly and dramatically amplified [1]. When these processes are triggered by medical treatment procedures, such as treatment with biomaterials or drug delivery devices or the transplantation of cells, cell clusters, or solid organs, the end result may be thrombotic/inflammatory reactions that can diminish the efficacy of the treatment or (in the case of transplantations) induce graft impairment or rejection, processes that are detrimental to the patient undergoing treatment (reviewed in [2]).",

All three pathways lead to the assembly of the CP/LP C3-convertase C4bC2a and the AP C3-convertase C3bBb, both of which cleave C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and the opsonin C3b.

In each case, binding to target surfaces induces the activation of enzymatic compounds that mediate the proteolytic activation of C4 and C2, leading to the formation of the CP/LP C3 convertase, C4bC2a. Activation of the AP can be facilitated by properdin binding and also via the so-called \u201ctick-over\u201d mechanism, whereby the internal thiol ester of C3 is disrupted and the C3(H2O) or iC3 formed acquires C3b-like properties and can form an initial AP C3 convertase, (C3(H2O)Bb), in the fluid phase.",

The MAC promotes cell lysis via its insertion into the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. The terminal complex is also present complexed with vitronectin in a soluble, aborted form, termed sC5b-9. Other important effector functions of complement, in addition to direct cell lysis by the MAC, include the recruitment and activation of PMNs and monocytes by the anaphylotoxins C3a and C5a, with C5a being the more potent. Phagocytosis of the target particles is facilitated by the interaction between the target-bound opsonin C3b, and its fragments iC3b and C3dg with complement receptors (CR1, CR3, CR4, and CRIg), which are upregulated on phagocytic cells in response to anaphylatoxins.",

The generated KK activates soluble FXII to \u03b2-FXIIa, which in turn generates more KK, providing a very effective amplification loop.

Initially, no complement activation seems to occur on the platelet surface, but C3 in the form of C3(H2O) is bound to the surfaces of activated platelets. In addition, several other complement components (C1q, C4, C9, ficolins-1, -2, and -3, and MASP-1 and MASP-2) are all detected on the surface of activated platelets [13], [14]. The lack of complement activation despite the abundance of bound complement proteins is consistent with the strong expression of membrane-bound complement regulators and the high density of plasma-derived complement regulators (factor H, C4BP, vitronectin), partially bound via CS-A to the platelet surface [15]. Platelet-bound C3(H2O) acts as a ligand for leukocyte CR1(CD35) and CR3 (CD11b/CD18), thereby serving as an important ligand in the tethering of activated platelets to PMNs [16].",

We have recently reported that both MASP-1 and MASP-2 become activated by interaction with preformed fibrin, produced using purified fibrinogen and thrombin, without the involvement of platelets [14]. Hence, the interaction between fibrin and the MASPs may represent a crossroad between the complement and coagulation systems as well as another amplification mechanism, analogous to that between FXII and fibrin mentioned above (Section 2.3). When activated on fibrin, MASP-1 and MASP-2 are inactivated exclusively by AT, without the presence of heparin as a co-factor [14].

            "text": "When an artificial (bio)material comes into contact with blood, the first event to occur is an instantaneous protein adsorption onto the material surface, which can be observed within the first second [28], [29]. The plasma proteins form a monolayer on the material surface, and the composition of the protein layer and the amount of the individual protein deposited is mainly affected by the material\u2019s inherent chemical and physical properties [30], [31]. Among the plasma proteins, IgG [32] and C3 [33] preferentially bind to material surfaces in their altered conformations, thereby triggering CP and AP activation, respectively. Once the complement system is activated, C3b covalently binds to the protein film surface and activates the amplification loop, generating more C3b fragments. These fragments will ultimately conceal the initial protein layer, enhancing the release of C3a and C5a as well as sC5b-9 into the fluid phase [29]. These anaphylatoxins are potent chemo-attractants that bind to PMNs and monocytes and recruit them to the biomaterial site. Active leukocytes recognize surface-bound C3b fragments via ligands such as CD11b/CD18 and initiate opsonization and cytokine release [34]. Thrombi on biomaterial surfaces are formed by platelet-mediated reactions and coagulation activation [35]. Plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin are potent mediators of platelet adhesion, and they are prone to bind to material surfaces. A minute amount of fibrinogen is sufficient to induce primary platelet activation via integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 interactions [36]. In addition, FXII adsorbed onto material surfaces automatically activates the contact system pathway of the coagulation cascade, generating thrombin that can, in turn, intensively activate platelets. Furthermore, IgG, IgM, and human serum albumin (HSA) have been demonstrated to potentiate activation of FXII, leading to contact pathway activation [37], [38]. Generally, biomaterial surfaces lack complement or coagulation regulators. Therefore, once the cascade systems are activated, they can spin out of control, resulting in the accumulation of anaphylatoxins and the activation of immune cells and generation of thrombi. This sequence of events is summarized in Fig. 3\n.",

There is a higher risk of myocardial infarction for hemodialysis patients than for healthy individuals [44]. In addition, CPB and ECMO procedures have increased over the past decade as patients who have had vascular bypass surgery have begun to suffer from long-lasting infections affecting the lungs, e.g., swine influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [45]. The CPB and ECMO procedures are usually associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), in which contact between the blood and the material surfaces evokes cellular and humoral defense reactions [46]. Even vascular stents, which are small implants, induce fibrosis, restenosis, and thrombosis when they are exposed to the bloodstream [47]. Cardiac aids and pumps can trigger thrombotic reactions, leading to emboli [48]. Thus, the thromboinflammatory reactions induced at the implantation site lead to deleterious effects.",

The administration of these cells is usually associated with a large loss of transplanted cells as the result of thromboinflammation [49], [50], [51], [54], which is also termed the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). Once the cell surface is exposed to host blood, the innate immune system is triggered and thromboinflammation occurs on the cell surface due to expression of TF and rapid binding of platelets and infiltration of leukocytes into the clot, resulting in early loss of the transplanted cells. This results in the loss of transplanted cells. In addition to TF, collagen is also involved in the activation of the thromboinflammation [53]; for example, when MSCs were systemically infused into 44 patients, a reduction in the platelet count and a significant increase in thrombin-antithrombin (TAT; i.e., a marker of thrombin activation) and elevated levels of C3a were detected within 48 h [53]. Also, we have reported a case of clinical hepatocyte transplantation in which an increase in TAT and C3a levels and a reduction in platelet concentration were found within an hour after transplantation [54]. In conclusion, transplanted cells may be expected to be destroyed by thromboinflammatory reactions immediately after infusion.",

            "text": "The corresponding reactions in whole-organ transplantation are ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and xenogenic/allogeneic antibody-mediated rejection, the major mediator of cell damage during transplantation [42], which is also triggered by complement activation and thrombotic reaction-induced thromboinflammation. IRI occurs upon re-establishment of the blood supply to cells, tissues, or organs that have been exposed to prolonged imbalance between oxygen/nutrient supply and demand [55]. This critical reaction is an inevitable event during organ transplantation, but IRI also occurs in a wide range of other clinically relevant situations such as brain death, sepsis, and cardiac surgery, as well as revascularization after myocardial infarction or stroke. IRI is a complex pathophysiological process involving a cascade of adverse events including hypoxia, ATP exhaustion, mitochondrial damage, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and ionic imbalance, which ultimately leads to structural lesions of the endothelial cells and initial activation of innate immunity and, subsequently, of adaptive immunity. The endothelial cell surface is normally covered by a negatively charged glycocalyx, which consists of a complex network of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and glycoproteins as well as a number of anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant proteins that ensure microvascular homeostasis and prevent thromboinflammation. Moreover, this thick shield engulfs adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, preventing the recruitment of leukocytes and platelets on the endothelial surface. In IRI, vascular protective barriers such as the vascular glycocalyx are lost, resulting in a decrease in adenylate cyclase activity and an increase in vascular permeability [56]. Under hypoxic conditions, TF, together with proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, is expressed on endothelial and stromal cell surfaces. Also, there is a deposition of complement components onto the cell surface. These reactions lead to the triggering of local inflammation, with the binding of platelets and infiltration of leukocytes, particularly PMNs. This response leads to a further loss of integrity of the endothelial cells, ultimately causing vascular damage. After exposure to circulating fresh blood, the hypoxic cells are also attacked by the innate immune system, which recognizes the cells as \u201caltered self\u201d structures. This attack further aggravates the condition and finally leads to cell death and apoptosis. Recognition molecules in this process are FXII, MBL, and the ficolins; also, CRP and natural antibodies of the IgM isotype (both of which most likely also involve C1q) have also been implicated in these reactions (Fig. 4\n).",

C1-INH is not a specific complement inhibitor, in that it also regulates proteases generated by the contact system (Section 2.3).

When platelets are activated, a multi-step process begins that involves adhesion, aggregation, contraction, and secretion. Released ADP is essential for recruiting and aggregating platelets; therefore, it is an obvious target for achieving platelet inhibition [60]. Nilsson et al., have reported that the ADP-degrading enzyme apyrase, immobilized onto substrate surfaces, can inhibit both platelet activation and platelet-dependent activation of the coagulation system [61], [62]. The idea comes from CD39 (NTPDase-1, EC 3.6.1.5), an enzyme expressed on human endothelial cells, which has an ADP-degrading activity similar to that of apyrase [63]. In order to regulate platelet activation, vascular ADP is continuously degraded under homeostatic conditions by CD39. In fact, the immobilization of apyrase can attenuate the activation of platelet and the coagulation system.",

Apyrase immobilized on the cell surfaces of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) has been shown to prevent coagulation activation as well as platelet activation in human whole blood [62].

            "text": "Regarding the regulation of complement system, utilization of the fluid-phase RCAs factor H and C4BP is effective for local regulation on the surfaces of materials and cells. Several studies have indicated that complement activation on material surfaces is initiated through the CP [29], [68]. The concept of exploiting those complement-regulatory effects on foreign surfaces has been reported. Engberg et al. have used streptococcal M protein-derived peptides to specifically recruit human C4BP to substrate surfaces, thereby reducing complement activation via the CP and suggesting that RCA-binding peptides may be promising regulators of complement activation on the surface [69]. The AP C3 convertase is of major importance because of its ability to amplify the reaction on the surface [33], [70], [71]. Therefore, it is critical to regulate the AP C3 convertase in order to avoid complement attack. The mobilization of factor H to the surface of materials and cells offers a possible approach to regulating complement systems through the AP that has been explored using purified, covalently immobilized factor H to regulate complement activation [72], [73]. Another approach has been the use of factor H-binding peptides, which can specifically recruit factor H from the plasma of the host. Various peptides with high affinity for various domains of human factor H were created, and one of these peptides (5C6) recruited factor H without interfering with its regulatory function, since it bound to a region of this regulator that does not interact with the C3 convertase [74]. By immobilizing 5C6 onto materials, factor H can be specifically recruited from the host blood onto the surface, thereby mimicking the host surface and protecting the host cells from attack by complement [75], [76]. Moreover, it is also possible to co-immobilize 5C6 with apyrase, which is autoregulatory against thromboinflammation. This surface modification with 5C6 and apyrase can be applied to both substrates (artificial materials) and cells [62].",

            "text": "Platelets are intimately involved in the incompatibility processes that occur on foreign surfaces and are directly activated by surfaces [1]. Not only are platelets closely connected to the coagulation cascade, but they can also interact with leukocytes and trigger the activation of complement, thereby acting as an important hub that mediates cross-talk between these components [1], [12]. Therefore, it is critical to regulate both coagulation/platelet activation and complement activation. Using cell-surface modification techniques employing PEG-lipid derivatives, it is possible to co-immobilize apyrase and 5C6 onto the cell surfaces of PAECs. When exposed to human whole blood, factor H is specifically recruited to the modified surfaces and inhibits complement attack. In addition, activation of platelets and coagulation is efficiently attenuated as a result of ADP degradation. Thus, by inhibiting thromboinflammation with a multicomponent approach, we can create a hybrid surface with the potential to greatly reduce incompatibility reactions involving biomaterials and transplants.",

The term \u201cthromboinflammation\u201d refers to adverse inflammatory and thrombotic crosstalk- reactions, which are initiated and propagated by the different constituents of the innante immune system, which ultimately may result in thrombosis and/or chronic inflammation. Thromboinflammation is triggered by biomaterials, which lack the physiological inhibitors present on autologous cells, as well as by therapeutic cells in contact with blood. If uncontrolled, these adverse reactions may cause damage to an implant, a graft, and/or the recipient. Therefore, control of thromboinflammation is a major hurdle to overcome in order to improve results in a number of treatments using biomaterials and transplantation of cells and/or whole organs. Targeting the surface of biomaterials and the surface for therapeutic cells and solid organs with specific inhibitors is a promising approach to decrease thromboinflammation and thereby improve clinical outcome.",
