Many of these molecules are still being used today, including aspirin, steroids, and antibiotics produced by microorganisms. In light of the problems with bringing a new drug to market, many researchers consider screening Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved drugs for repurposing a lower risk than de novo drug design.1 Searching for specific molecules for a novel drug target may be perceived as unrealistically slow,2 especially during emerging disease outbreaks.3, 4 Thus, the approximately 4000 compounds used in the clinic are now being reinvestigated, to see what other treatments they could provide for difficult to treat conditions. Searching approved drugs for new purposes has been aided by commercially available compilations of drugs approved by the FDA, such as the Prestwick Chemical Library, the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC1280) and others,5, 6 or specific libraries assembled for various purposes, such as those targeting RNA\u2010protein interactions 7 or kinases. The \u201cDrug Repurposing Hub\u201d (http://www.broadinstitute.org/repurposing), consisting of both a reliable physical source for approved drugs, as well as a virtual library describing their characteristics, will certainly help to identify new uses for the existing pantheon.8 There are also a variety of other publicly available resources that can assist repurposing, including RepurposingDB,9 Re:fine Drugs10, or repoDB.11\n",

The section highlights how, despite a disastrous first introduction and withdrawal from the clinic in the last century, thalidomide and its derivatives are now used to treat a variety of serious health threats. While drugs designed to treat many indications have been introduced into cancer therapy,13 the thalidomide story illustrates how even a drug with serious known side effects can be successful. It is also an example of how simple changes in structure can generate a much more active molecule, showing how repurposing can aid in the design of novel drugs (section 3). Many other examples are given of drugs that have found new uses, far from their initial indications.",

Section 2.2 highlights these strategies, as well as efforts to combine antibiotics with agents that target bacterial toxins15, 16 or block bacterial enzymes from exporting or degrading antibiotics.

Ways to complement antibiotics and antivirals with drugs that enhance host cell resistance mechanisms have thus become an active and promising area for study,2 discussed in Section 2.3. One driving force for this is the ability of pathogens to quickly develop resistance to targeted inhibitors. For example, drug resistance has developed to two of four FDA\u2010approved antivirals17, 18 against influenza. Activating the host immune system is especially important in looking for new ways to treat chronic infections such as tuberculosis (TB).19 New ways must also be found for treating viruses, including Ebola, that have developed mechanisms to evade host immune systems. Paradoxically, the repurposing wave is occurring just as the clinical success of direct\u2010acting antivirals (DAAs) against Hepatitis C virus has shown the power of high throughput screening coupled with structure\u2010based, rational design.20, 21\n",

Many approved drugs have low solubility, lack specificity, and may require unrealistic dosing for uses beyond their initial target (Section 3.1). Dosages that may be well tolerated in trials conducted using healthy subjects (or in the case of animal studies, healthy until infected) may not be achievable in the clinic. Patients in the clinic or field hospital are very sick when they present and have comorbidities. Burn, cancer, Ebola, and other emerging infection victims are fragile patients. They will thus be more likely to suffer side effects at high doses. Collaboration with medicinal chemists at an early stage in development can insure more specific and potent therapies for testing. In Section 3.2, a few examples show how derivatives of older drugs, with better pharmaceutical properties and selectivity, can bring new treatments into the clinic. These derivatives can add to the continuously expanding drug pantheon.",

The drug was not approved by the US\u2010FDA, as the young examiner assigned to the thalidomide application noted defects in its safety profile. She was especially concerned about severe peripheral neuritis reported as a possible side effect.23 Thus, even without teratogenicity testing, thalidomide's potential to cause dangerous side effects was clear before 1960. Thalidomide was withdrawn worldwide in 1962 only after it became notorious for causing severe birth defects. The drug's other associated side effects, including rash, tremor, hypothyroidism, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (in 3%\u20104% of patients) would seem to have doomed it to a mere cautionary tale in the history of pharmacy.",

One of the most useful TB drugs, isoniazid, inhibits the enzyme InhA, blocking the synthesis of the mycolic acids that make up the cell wall of the mycobacterium. Much of the resistance to isoniazid, a prodrug, comes from mutations in the bacterial enzymes required to activate it. It has recently been found that an older natural product antibiotic, pyridomycin, discovered in the 1950s, inhibits InhA directly. Thus it can be used to treat infections with resistant TB strains that survive by their lack of ability to activate isoniazid.61 Understanding this mechanism of action may also advance the use of pyridomycin in conjunction with other drugs.62\n",

Today, topical versions of the dye are being tested for reducing scarring after injury or burns.128 The molecule became even more interesting when testing in the 1980s indicated it inhibited the growth of tumor cells. A formulation, PV\u201010, is in clinical trials for treating tumors.129 However, large amounts of the dye are required as the compound has only a 30\u2010minute half\u2010life in serum and as Figure 1 illustrates, it is a large hydrophobic molecule with limited solubility. The results of these trials may be used to obtain derivatives with better pharmaceutical characteristics, designed for solubility or more specific anticancer activities.",
