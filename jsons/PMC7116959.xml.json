            "text": "In response to oil shortages, air pollution and climate change, an increasing number of governments have begun to set goals for energy savings and emission reductions (USEPA, 2012, Zhang et al., 2011a, Zhang et al., 2011b, Zhang et al., 2014). More than half of the world's population currently lives in cities. What is more, their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions accounted for more than 80% of the world's total GHG emissions (Feng et al., 2013). In China, approximately 18% of the population lives in the 35 largest cities, but they brought in vast energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which accounted for more than 40% (Dhakal, 2009). Therefore, energy savings and emission reductions at the city level played a vital role in the process of fulfilling existing overall energy conservation and emission reduction targets (Chen and Chen, 2012, Zhang et al., 2012, Chun et al., 2011, Li et al., 2010). In addition, energy consumption and CO2 emissions from urban passenger transport played an important role at the city level; therefore, energy conservation and emission reductions in urban passenger transport became important measures by which to achieve low-carbon development goals (Litman, 2013a, Litman, 2013b, Geng et al., 2013, Chiou et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Currently, there are many researchers interested in urban transport energy conservation and emissions reduction measures (AASHTO, 2009, Ross Morrow et al., 2010, Gross et al., 2009, Seckin et al., 2013). Substantially, these measures can be divided into two categories: a clean vehicles strategy, which reduces energy consumption and emissions of vehicles or other automotive devices per kilometer using related technical improvements for vehicles or fuel; and a mobility management strategy, which reduces traffic volume through a variety of measures. However, there have been many debates regarding which strategy is optimal overall. Researchers who support a clean vehicles strategy usually think that mobility management is difficult to implement because there is great uncertainty and the potential for great harm to residents' utility and the urban economy (Cox and Moore, 2011, Hartgen et al., 2011, McKinsey, 2007, Moore et al., 2010). Others who support a mobility management strategy argue that the effect of mobility management on energy conservation and emissions reduction is more economical and efficient (TRB, 2009; USDOT, 2010; Gross et al., 2009). The mentioned measures are not absolutely negative or positive in principle. But comprehensive energy conservation and emission reduction policy should include various mobility management policies both in developed countries and developing countries (Litman, Litman, 2013a, Litman, 2013b). What is more, there is a high-income elasticity of demand for cars in developing countries. It means that car ownership will grow faster in the nearest future (Dargay and Gately, 1999). Thus, the motorization of developing countries will put a strain on global efforts to cut carbon emissions from transport. At the same time, developing countries lack the financial resources and governance system for achieving low-carbon transport target. Fortunately, the mobility management strategy can help cities in developing countries on the path toward a more low-carbon future (Santos et al., 2010). So we primarily analyze mobility management measures.",

            "text": "In the past few years, a large number of studies have delved into the problem of urban transport energy consumption and emissions. These researches can primarily be divided into three types: top-down, bottom-up and hybrid methods.(1)Top-down methods mainly include CGE, MACRO, GEM-E3, 3Es-Model, and so on. For example, Schafer and Jacoby (2005) analyzed how promoted new automobile technologies enter the automobile market and influence climate change under policy constraints using the CGE Model. Small (2012) assessed the effectiveness and cost of different energy policies for light motor vehicles using the National Energy Modeling System. Rentziou et al. (2012) forecasted urban passenger transport volume, energy consumption and CO2 emissions based on the simultaneous equations Model. On the whole, top-down methods are good at providing economic analyses, but not do well in describing technology concretely. These methods generally underestimate the potential for technological progress (Nakata, 2004).(2)The bottom-up approach primarily includes MARKAL, MESSAGE, EFOM, LEAP model, and so on. For example, Pressley et al. (2014) utilized a life cycle assessment methodology to evaluate the conversion of U.S. municipal solid waste to liquid transportation fuels via gasification and Fischer\u2013Tropsch. Contreras, et al. (2009) analyzed the change in hydrogen energy vehicles' market share in road traffic using the MARKAL model. Cort\u00e9s et al. (2008) developed an object-oriented simulation platform using a Java program to analyze urban traffic network energy consumption and emissions. On the whole, bottom-up methods perform economic analyses poorly, providing useful detailed descriptions of technology. These analyses generally overestimate the potential for economic progress (Nakata, 2004).(3)Hybrid methods mainly include NEMS, POLES, PRIMES, POLES model, and so on. For example, Messner and Schrattenholzer (2000) analyzed an energy supply situation according to demand changes for different passenger and cargo transport units using an IIASA-CEC E3 model. Hickman et al. (2010) built the transport and carbon simulation model and investigated a series of potential policy packages that could reduce the emission's effect in London. Yang et al. (2009) built Long-term Evaluation of Vehicle Emissions Reduction Strategies and researched how to reach the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 in California. On the whole, hybrid methods combine the advantages of top-down and bottom-up methods. Not only are their functions more complete, but they also have a more complex structure. Therefore, they are more suitable to the simulation of complex giant systems.\n",

In the field of transportation, SD was applied to research into the operational management of the public transport enterprise (Bivona and Montemaggiore, 2010), the operational management of roads and infrastructure networks (Fallah-Fini et al., 2010), the usage of low emission cars such as electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles (Walther et al., 2010), and the relationship between land usage and urban transport (Pfaffenbichler et al., 2010). Recently, Vafa-Arani et al. (2014) built an SD model that included urban transportation and air polluting industries subsystems to research urban air pollution in Tehran, Iran.

Annual incremental car purchase credits numbered 240,000, and individual demand accounted for 88% of credits. Credits were distributed by free lottery.

Third, the population of Beijing reached 19.619 million in 2010. The floating population reached 7.047 million with an incremental increase of 905,000 people from the year before. The population has reached its highest record level so far. The explosive growth in population has placed huge pressure on the urban passenger transport system in Beijing. Therefore, we suggest limiting the influx of floating populations by balancing development of medium cities and small towns, gradually reducing or even cancelling special benefits obtained from Beijing's Household Registration.",

In the ARM scenario, total energy consumption has the largest decline of all of the individual policies in the beginning and maintains a lower level of consumption continuously until 2020.

In TDM scenario, energy consumption per capita shows a slow decline in the beginning, and then its decline becomes more rapid. In the PDPT scenario, energy consumption per capita shows a sharp downward trend, but the pace of decline slows down gradually. Energy consumption per capita in the ARM scenario is the lowest of all individual policies, but the amplitude of decline is much smaller than in the PDPT scenario throughout the entire period. Compared with different scenarios, the ARM and TDM policies have a huge initial drop in energy consumption per capita. However, the PDPT policy will result in a dramatic decrease in energy consumption per capita on the whole. Therefore, it presents an important way to fundamentally reduce energy consumption from urban passenger transport.

In terms of emissions reductions, TP's contribution is much stronger here than in the area of energy savings. ARM can achieve the stated goals most quickly and with the largest drop in numbers.

Therefore, vehicle manufacturers and energy providers usually lack the motivation to research such technologies.

Furthermore, the implementation cost of each policy was not taken into account in this analysis. These conditions need to be studied further. Governments should choose the appropriate policy portfolio to achieve the most significant energy savings and emission reductions in practice, according to each city's own characteristics and development stage and considering the cost of implementation and the applicable scope of different policies.",
