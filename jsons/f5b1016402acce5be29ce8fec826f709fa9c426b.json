            "text": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently occurred neurobehavioral disorder among children (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000) , which has negative impact on a wide range of aspects including learning ability, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, and emotions (Lecendreux et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2017) . Previous meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of ADHD among children and adolescents in China was 6 % (Wang et al., 2017) . In the event of COVID-19 outbreak, schools in China are shut down and students are restricted to staying at homes. Primary and secondary schools in China open online official educational websites in order to allocate students to continue the education (Xinhua Net, 2020). Children with ADHD face noticeable challenges during this period. Firstly, the loss of daily routine and the lack of interpersonal and social interaction could work as potential risk factors for mental health problems or could worsen ADHD symptoms. In addition, majority of the ADHD children receive care from primary care settings (Patel et al., 2017 ; Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity et al., 2011) . Children with ADHD could not get timely and professional care from home setting. Most of the parents of these children can be assumed not to be the domain experts but are forced upon the educational responsibility in addition to handle all the children's emotional and behavioral problems 24/7. Moreover, the pandemic of COVID-19 is a serious challenge to everyone including the adults. Their worry of the situation may further exacerbate the children's psychological wellbeing and worsen their behavioural problems.",

Finally, the relationship between the worsened behaviours among children with ADHD and their medication status was not directly tested.

To examine the relationship between child's ADHD behaviours and acute stress, attention to media coverage, time allocation, and the mood state of children and parents, a stepwise regression analysis was conducted with ADHD behaviours treated as the DV and all the other variables IVs. The stepwise regression analysis determined a three-predictor model, with F(3, 237) = 31.73, p < .001, R 2 = 0.29. In particular, children's overall mood, B = 0.17, 95 % CI of B [0.11, 0.23], p < .001, parents' overall mood state, B = 0.13, 95 % CI of B [0.06, 0.20], p < .001, and children's study time, B = \u22120.09, 95 % CI of B [\u22120.15, \u22120.02], p = .010, significantly predicted children's ADHD behaviours.",
