The result, a protocol based on the formalized consensus of 42 international, multidisciplinary neurotrauma experts, provides class III evidence to guide the management of sTBI patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) as their only monitored brain-specific parameter [1]. During this process, the group expressed a desire to additionally address multi-modality monitoring if possible. They strongly supported brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) monitoring as their first choice for the second parameter. Indeed, the evidence suggesting that sTBI clinical care informed by PbtO2 measures may lead to improved clinical outcomes is growing [3]. This paper thus presents the second product of the SIBICC meeting, an algorithm for managing adult sTBI patients based on combined monitoring of ICP and PbtO2.",

The other is to maintain integration of the two monitors and create separate algorithms for the three pathologic combinations of ICP and PbtO2 status. Our panel felt that when high ICP and low PbtO2 are present concurrently ideal management would not simply reflect a simple combination of care provided when high ICP and low PbtO2 each exist in isolation. In particular, the CWG felt that mechanical ventilation requires distinct management when both high ICP and low PbtO2 are present concurrently. In the interest of supporting precision medicine and to ease clinical application by providing specific, separate protocols for individual pathological combinations, we chose to present three distinct algorithms (Figs. 2,3,4,5).

The provider should maintain awareness of the duration of any episode and consider moving to more aggressive interventions in a higher tier quickly if the patient is not responding.

FiO2 can effectively increase PbtO2 values. Although the CWG approved upward FiO2 adjustment to 60% at tier one, further oxygenation manipulation was left to the discretion of the physician in terms of manipulation of ventilator dynamics, PEEP, FiO2, etc. Therefore, at tier two, elevating the PaO2 up to 150 mm Hg is recommended but the means is meant to be fine-tuned to the patient.

First-tier recommendations include setting the target CPP at the upper limit of the generally accepted range of 60\u201370 mm Hg as blood pressure augmentation can be an effective strategy for increasing PbtO2. The avoidance of hypocarbia is also stressed in tier one; hypercarbia induces vasodilation which can improve PbtO2 though this strategy increases intracranial blood volume and risks ICP elevation. At tier two, the CWG supported consideration of setting an ICP threshold below the general target of 22 mm Hg (acknowledging that this group does not have intracranial hypertension by definition). They also allowed compliance manipulation via CSF drainage.",

At tier one, therefore, although the CWG supported elevation of the FiO2 to 60% and setting the CPP threshold to the upper limit of the normal range (i.e., 70 mm Hg), they recommended against hyperventilation to any degree which could worsen PbtO2. In tier two, the CWG recommended raising the PaO2 to as high as 150 mm Hg in addition to considering neuromuscular blockade and CPP manipulation based on autoregulation testing but did not support lowering the ICP threshold. At tier three, they combined ICP-based recommendations for pentobarbital/thiopentone coma or decompressive craniectomy with PbtO2-based treatments including normobaric hyperoxia to above 150 mm Hg and limited transfusion. Notably, decompressive craniectomy can enable more aggressive PbtO2 augmentation strategies such as hypercarbia which can exacerbate ICP; it can also mitigate the intracranial hypertension associated with MAP augmentation in patients who are not autoregulating.",
