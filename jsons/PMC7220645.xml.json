During the first 4 months of spread, this deadly disease has infected about three million people resulting in about two hundred thousand deaths in more than 209 countries. These figures are mostly of the hospital admissions of a handful countries as reported by the media. Real numbers would never be known. The United States of America has the maximum number of casualties as well as infections, followed by Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. These figures are largely reported by a handful of developed countries. However, there is limited information of fatalities reported from developing countries, many of which do not have adequate testing facilities and/or hospital beds to treat all the patients. Therefore, the extent of actual damage by COVID-19 would be limited in its accuracy.",

During 165\u2013180 A.D., the Antonine Plague, is thought have killed more than five million people in the Roman Empire. During 541\u2013542 the bubonic plague, named as Justinian (after the name of the Emperor) killed up to one tenth of the world\u2019s population [12]. The Black Death during 1346\u201353 killed more than half of the population of Europe [12]. During 1545\u201348, the Cocoliztli epidemic took the lives of fifteen million people of Mexico and Central America. The Great Plague of London during 1965\u201366 killed about one hundred thousand people, and the Great Plague of Marseille during 1720\u20131723 wiped out thirty percent of the population of the area [12]. The Russian plague during 1770\u20131772 took the lives of about one hundred thousand people in and around Moscow, and Flu pandemic during 1889\u20131890 took the lives of about one million people globally [12].",

There seems to be some controversy about the effectiveness of face masks. Various outlets have frequently reported the shortage of medical grade masks (N95) due to high demand for medical professionals and general public globally. The Centers for Diseases and Prevention (CDC) has also advised people to use face masks, and even use cloth masks if proper ones are not available. Studies have revealed that even the best face masks cannot prevent some unfiltered air getting through. In order to make them highly effective, social distancing is recommended to reduce the risk of contaminated droplets being spread from an infected person to other people through coughing or sneezing. Self-isolation is also a very useful technique to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

Holding the breath for 10 s or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean that the body is free from COVID-19. Mosquito bites cannot transmit coronavirus. There is no evidence that eating garlic prevents coronavirus although garlic is considered very healthy for the body. People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). But those at greatest risk of infection include the elderly, people with compromised immune systems and people with chronic health conditions (e.g. asthma, diabetes and heart disease).",

Recently we have witnessed the oil prices to hit the subzero territory for the first time during the history of the mankind. We are already witnessing some very serious impact in China, where the virus first emerged in December 2019, seems to be coming out of the pandemic. According to [23], China has suffered loss of 13.5% in its industrial production, 21% in retail sales, 92% in car sales, and 95% in restaurants. According to [24], world\u2019s working class, estimated to be more than three and a quarter billion strong is being severely impacted by the sudden and unimaginable slowdown in the world economy causing unprecedented loss in employment in all countries. One of the reasons cited for the heavy toll lies in the fact that more than four-fifth of the workforce lives in countries which are under severe restrictions of distancing and lockdown due to curfews and other mandatory closures. According to [26], decline in working hours by 1st Aril 2020 is estimated to be equivalent to two hundred million fulltime job loss. Many developed countries are facing a two digit unemployment rate forcing people to seek unemployment benefits, severely impacting the economies of those countries. If the pandemic is prolonged, the loss of jobs could be many folds. Goldman Sachs has predicted that the US economy in the April-June quarter of 2020 could shrink to about three fourth, more than twice worse of any previous setbacks [23]. The pandemic has the potential to cause the worst recession ever.",
