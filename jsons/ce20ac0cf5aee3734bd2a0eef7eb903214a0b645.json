First, they have higher financial risk due to the need for accessible housing and personal assistance. Moreover, they face greater health risks, depending on their specific situation. In addition, the risk to their education is also higher due to potentially inaccessible course content and classroom environments [21, 31] .

Our sample includes 28 students with disabilities/health concerns in 2020. Where relevant, we also make comparisons to data collected from a subset of 91 students, of whom 13 have disabilities/health concerns who filled out a very similar survey in Spring 2019 (before COVID- 19) .",

Impact on Mental Health. When social systems are placed under stress due to sudden forces such as a global health pandemic, the impact on marginalized populations can be especially severe. Outbreaks of widespread infectious diseases, such as SARS and COVID-19, are associated with psychological distress and eroded mental health, stimulating calls for mental health care to be part of the national public health emergency system [4] . Our examination of mental health impacts starts with exposure to stressors. We look at several potential sources of stress, including the use of social media, income loss, quarantine and isolation, loneliness, chronic discrimination, and overall exposure to adversity.",

Thus, we argue that under COVID-19 (and, really, in general) an accessible education is also one that contributes to student well-being and resilience. Our data help to justify this need by demonstrating that, at least in our sample, students with disabilities are operating under increased stress loads both over their lifetime and specifically since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition, some stressors differentially impact vulnerable groups, and these impacts can translate into changes in mental health and behavior (e.g., [36] ), particularly when they interact with risk [35] . Increasing participation by people with disabilities requires understanding and efforts to lessen the particular stresses and risks they face. The COVID-19 pandemic is one obvious stressor that may directly impact students in a multitude of ways. Some may be at greater risk of contracting the illness and interrupted access to health services [3] . Pandemics can also impact availability of personal assistance, reduce educational accessibility [21] , and create higher risks of exposure than for the overall population [5] . Below we explore expected consequences for learning and mental health of these stressors for people with disabilities.",

As of 2015, only Blackboard (of all online learning management systems) had been awarded Gold certification for its accessibility by the National Federation for the Blind [21] . In addition, content generators (i.e. faculty) have a big impact on the accessibility of their content [21, 22] and over half (65%) of faculty are unsure or do not know how to make accommodations [31] . This results in many courses being designed and deployed without accessibility support [21] . When faculty additionally have to make very rapid changes to their courses due to pressure to go online quickly, it is even less likely that they will make time to attend to an issue they are unsure of, like accessibility.",

For example, many individuals show resilience in disasters; this resilience manifested in a recent study of college students who, contrary to expectations, reported less loneliness in April than in February of this year [10] . Daily surveys by Kanter et al. of the general population from March 14th through May 5th 2020 (during the COVID-19 epidemic) have not shown overall increases in anxiety, depression or loneliness (https://uwcovid19.shinyapps.io/dashboard/).

What is expected is that people with disabilities/health concerns are likely to experience more stressors associated with the pandemic. In addition to the risks of COVID-19, and educational accessibility, emergency response plans do not always include planning for people with disabilities [5] , social distancing may be harder for people with disabilities who rely on caregivers, and people with disabilities may have to deal with inaccessible communications [5] . These risks may put people with disabilities at greater risk of experiencing distress associated with the pandemic. Their concerns about personal safety may be stronger than those of people without disabilities and they may be more vulnerable to stressors during the pandemic (such as disruption of critical health care). For these reasons they may be at greater risk of psychological distress.",

Drawing from research related to cumulative disadvantage and marginality [29] , we anticipate that students with disabilities will express justifiably greater vulnerability in the COVID-19 context through elevated levels of concern about their educational environment and likelihood of success, as well as features of their family and personal lives affected by the pandemic. Finally, we anticipate that students with disabilities may be experiencing greater levels of psychological distress in the form of mental health indicators.",

In 2020, we recruited from all past participants in the UWEXP study and additionally advertised to the entire University of Washington entering first-year student class.

For example, if a student's PTSD scores were 16 and 5 in this year and last year, respectively, the value on the y-axis would be 11.Not surprisingly (since it is a lifetime measure), the 13 returning students with disabilities/health concerns reportedsimilar exposure to Major Life Events in both 2019 ( = 11.15, = 5.18) and 2020 ( = 10.54, = 5.29), (25) = 0.30, = .77. We also examined the change in PTSD scores from 2019 to 2020 for the 13 students with disabilities/health concerns. As Figure 4 shows, 10 of the 12 students who answered the PTSD scale reported higher levels of PTSD symptomology in 2020 than in 2019, the majority being 10 or more points higher in 2020, which bears clinical relevance. The difference in scores is also significant (2019 ( = 17.5, = 13.57), 2020 ( = 29.31, = 16.13), (23) = 44.0, < .05. In comparison, for students without disabilities/health concerns, the change in score is smaller (only 19 out of 78 have an increase 10 points or more) and the difference in scores is significant in 2019 ( = 8.18, = 9.6) and 2020 ( = 13.0, = 12.01), (\u22122.73) =, < .01.",
