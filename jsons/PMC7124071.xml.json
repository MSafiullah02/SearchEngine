Drugs, toxins, heavy use of alcohol, reduced blood supply to the liver, and microorganisms including viruses may cause it. However, signs and symptoms of hepatitis from any virus are similar and the specific cause is often undistinguishable without blood tests. Sometimes patients have no symptoms. When patients do experience symptoms, these may include jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), fatigue, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever. In severe cases, patients may start noticing swelling of feet, abdomen, or confusion and drowsiness. If any combination of these symptoms occurs, medical care should be sought immediately.\nHow does it occur? Is it contagious?\nMost viral hepatitis occurs from human-to-human transmission, though animal-to-human transmission may also occur. Different viruses may be transmitted either from contaminated water and food; bodily secretions like blood, semen, and saliva (e.g., herpesviruses); or droplets when people cough or sneeze (influenza). The mechanism of transmission and its contagiousness is specific to each virus.\nHow are these infections treated?\nHepatitis caused by viruses is usually treated symptomatically, meaning treating the symptoms of liver inflammation rather than the virus itself. However, some viruses may have a specific antiviral that can be used to eradicate it and prevent progression of the disease.\nHow do I know if I am getting better?\nRecovery after viral hepatitis typically starts with gradual resolution of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and return of appetite and energy. The jaundice is usually the last to resolve.\n",

However, non-hepatotropic viruses only cause acute hepatitis and/or acute liver failure, without causing any chronic damage to the liver. These viruses do not primarily target the liver; hence the term non-hepatotropic is used in their description. These viruses include the herpesviruses (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus [CMV], and herpes simplex virus), parvovirus, adenovirus, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [1].The risk of acquiring infection from any of the non-hepatotropic viruses is specific to each virus and is detailed below. Considerations for determining the risk of infection include sanitary conditions, prior exposure, host immune status, and duration of infection in the contact.\n",

            "text": "Approximately 90 % of people worldwide have been exposed to one or both HSV viruses [2]. HSV-1 is more common, with 65 % of persons in the USA being seropositive to HSV-1 [3]. It is almost universal in the developing world, usually acquired in childhood secondary to close contact with infected family members and causes oral cold sores [2]. HSV-2 on the other hand is less ubiquitous and incidence varies from 15 to 80 %, depending on the population. Transmission is almost exclusively during sexual activity [2].2.Which subgroups are at a particularly high risk for liver involvement with HSV?The infection in the liver with HSV is uncommon. However, when it does occur, it frequently leads to acute liver failure with a high mortality. Severe HSV infections are typically associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity that may occur in a transplant recipient or in patients on high-dose steroids. Females in the third trimester of pregnancy are also particularly at risk for acute liver failure.The diagnosis is often missed as skin lesions that provide clinical clues to the diagnosis are often lacking in patients with HSV-associated hepatitis. A high degree of suspicion, even in the absence of skin lesions, combined with early diagnostic modalities and early institution of appropriate therapy with parenteral acyclovir may dramatically improve survival [4].Four mechanisms of HSV dissemination and resultant hepatitis have been hypothesized [5]: (a) a large HSV inoculant overwhelming the defense system; (b) an impairment in host macrophages, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions; (c) enhanced virulence; and (d) activation of a latent hepatovirulent strain.HSV hepatitis is characterized by rapid development of fulminant hepatic necrosis with serum aminotransferase levels 100- to 1000-fold above normal and hyperbilirubinemia [4]. Positive serology often points at the diagnosis with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nconfirming the diagnosis. In the era of widespread availability of PCR testing, a liver biopsy is now less commonly needed to secure the diagnosis. Common findings on liver biopsy include massive liver necrosis with almost complete absence of portal tracts and central veins. Presence of typical intranuclear viral inclusions is the hallmark finding on a liver biopsy, confirmed with immunohistochemical staining.Given the time-sensitive nature\nof the disease, initiation of empiric therapy with acyclovir is indicated while awaiting diagnostic confirmation in a patient with acute liver failure.\n",

Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development, but they have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness [6]. Mortality remains very high.3.\nWhat is the management of patients who develop acute liver failure due to non-hepatotropic virus infection?\nAcute liver failure is defined by elevation in liver enzymes, an INR >1.5, and development of encephalopathy in someone without known underlying liver disease. It is associated with rapid progression and very high mortality. The first step towards appropriate management is prompt transfer of the patient to the nearest transplant center. These patients are preferably admitted to the critical care unit, and should have close frequent monitoring of sensorium and the basic chemistry panel. Their management is very similar to management of other patients with non-acetaminophen-associated liver failure and the use of N-acetylcysteine may also have a role [15].Management of advanced encephalopathy is arguably the most challenging in acute liver failure. Management is aimed at reducing intracranial pressure. When sedation is indicated, propofol is the preferred agent as it reduces brain edema [16].Early transplant consideration and evaluation offer the best chance at survival in patients with acute liver failure. Even with appropriate management, mortality remains high. Prior to transplantation, most series suggested less than 15 % survival. Currently\n, overall short-term survival (1 year) including those undergoing transplantation is greater than 65 % [17].4.\nDo the non-hepatotropic viruses cause chronic disease or result in an elevated risk of liver cancer?\nNone of the non-hepatotropic viruses, with the possible exception of PV-B19, has been shown to cause chronic liver disease. PV-B19 has been postulated as a rare and unusual etiology of chronic hepatitis. This observation is based on identification of viral DNA from the hepatocytes years after the original infection. However, the extent to which it results in actual fibrosis and chronic damage is unclear. Furthermore, interest has focused on a possible effect of co-infection with PV-B19 on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and C [18]. Similarly, none of the above viruses have been associated with liver cancer.\n",
