In the present study, we focused on the cytotoxic properties of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in influenza virus infection, because cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the major mechanism to eliminate virus-infected cells and thus to eliminate potential sources of new virus. In particular, as a component of innate immunity, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may act as early responders in viral control and clearance, compared with specific CTL activity. We showed that IPP-expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells could kill \u223c50% of human H1N1 virus\u2013infected MDMs after 6 h of coculture. Most importantly, similar potent cytotoxic activities of these cells against MDMs infected with the newly emerged avian fluA H5N1 virus and its precursor H9N2 virus were also found after 4\u20136 h of coculture. Furthermore, we found that IPP-expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells significantly inhibited H1N1, H9N2, and H5N1 viral replication by eliminating virus-infected MDMs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to demonstrate that IPP-expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have rapid and potent antiviral activity against both human and avian fluA viruses",

During 2 weeks of stimulation by IPP and IL-2, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells were expanded by \u223c36-fold. In fact, phosphoantigens have demonstrated the potential to facilitate large-scale in vitro expansion of functional \u03b3\u03b4 T cells for use in adoptive immunotherapy for tumors [36] and infectious diseases in different models [19, 20]. Although the lack of murine counterparts of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells has dramatically hampered efforts to understand the in vivo roles of phosphoantigens in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, the selective activation and expansion of these cells by phosphoantigens were also confirmed in some in vivo models, such as cynomolgus monkeys and severe combined immunodeficient mice engrafted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (human PBL-SCID mice) [17, 37]. Therefore, phosphoantigens such as IPP could be an alternative for treating human and avian fluA infections via targeting V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. Indeed, synthetic phosphoantigens named therapeutic aminobisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronate) have been commonly used clinically to treat osteoporosis through V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell\u2013mediated lysis of osteoclasts [38, 39]",

It has recently been demonstrated that NKG2D can directly activate V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells and trigger their release of cytolytic granules through recognition of the NKG2D ligand [44]. In humans, it has been identified that stress-inducible major histocompatibility complex class I\u2013related proteins A and B and members of the UL16-binding protein family (ULBP1\u20134 and RAET1G) are the ligands for NKG2D [45].

In the present study, we showed that most IPP-expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells expressed NKG2D and that the cytotoxicity of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells against H1N1- and H9N2-infected MDMs was significantly blocked by NKG2D neutralizing antibody, suggesting that the killing of influenza virus\u2013infected cells by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells requires NKG2D activation and recognition. That only influenza virus\u2013infected MDMs expressed up-regulated major histocompatibility complex class I\u2013related protein B, an NKG2D ligand [47], could also explain why IPP-expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells killed only H1N1-, H9N2-, and H5N1-infected MDMs but not mock-infected MDMs in the present study",

In addition, CD107a expression was increased only in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells cocultured with fluA virus\u2013infected MDMs and not in those cocultured with mock-infected MDMs, supporting the hypothesis that granule release from V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells requires virus-infected cell activation. Using the perforin inhibitor CMA and the granzyme B inactivator Bcl-2, we confirmed that perforin and granzyme B facilitated the cytolytic responses of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells to fluA virus\u2013infected MDMs, which is consistent with the findings of other studies in tumor and other virus-infected cells [18, 20, 33\u201335].
