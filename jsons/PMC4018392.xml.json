First experiments concerning the alimentary route were performed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Russia and Austria. It turned out that experimental infected goats excrete TBEV up to 8 days post infection and when orally infected develop a TBEV infection with the virus detectable in the small intestine [9], [11], [12]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that TBEV even though it is an enveloped RNA virus, retains its infectivity in gastric juice and can pass the stomach towards the intestine [13]. Therefore, Balogh et al. [14] postulated that TBEV probably enters the organism via small intestinal M cells of the Peyer's patches which then transport the viral particles to the intestinal lymphoid tissue, but experimental evidence is missing. In another study on the tick-borne encephalitis virus group, Kenyon et al. [15] demonstrated Kyasanur Forest disease virus antigen in epithelia cells of the gut mucosa in bonnet macaques.",

Recently, cellular entry by macropinocytosis has been described for various viruses such as influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, or vaccinia virus [18]\u2013[20]. Moreover, echovirus 1 is internalizing into Caco-2 cell by this mechanism, which displays many features characteristic for macropinocytosis [21]. Thus, we hypothesized that TBEV might also use macropinocytosis to enter intestinal epithelia cells. In our study, we used Caco-2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelium, in order to analyze, whether or not TBEV can replicate in the human intestinal cells and also to unveil the cellular uptake mechanism.",

EIPA has often been used as a hallmark inhibitor that specifically inhibits endocytosis via the macropinocytic pathway [29]. As shown in Figure 5A, TBEV entry into Caco-2 cells is inhibited by EIPA treatment in a dose-dependent manner. One characteristic of macropinocytosis is the nonselective uptake of large amounts of extracellular solutes [28]. To further investigate the involvement of macropinocytosis in TBEV entry, the uptake of soluble FITC-labeled dextran (Fdx) into Caco-2 cells was monitored. Fdx has often been applied as a morphological marker for macropinosomes and is used in fluid uptake assays. We found that TBEV infection slightly increased the uptake of Fdx into Caco-2 cells from 166\u00b179 vesicles and a total particle area of 5\u00b12 \u00b5m2 in mock control versus 1138\u00b1101 vesicles with a total particle area of 60\u00b14 \u00b5m2 (p<0.01 and P<0.001 respectively; n = 3) in a high-power field of 135 \u00b5m2 in TBEV infected cells (Figure 5B). The average particle size of 0.04\u00b10.01 \u00b5m2 in control was not different from Fdx vesicles in TBEV-infected Caco-2 monolayers with 0.06\u00b10.01 \u00b5m2 particle size (n = 3, n.s.). In addition, Early Endosome Antigen-1 (EEA1) was shown to be a marker of newly formed macropinosomes and mediated virus entry in cultured cells [30], [31]. The protein sorting nexin-5 (SNX5) mediates macropinosome formation and is involved in its maturation [32]. For this reason we analyzed co-localization of TBEV with endogenous EEA1 or SNX5 in Caco-2 cells. Figure 5D and E show a co-localization of TBEV E protein 24h p.i. with EEA1 or SNX5, respectively (See also Z-stack Figure S3 and S4 as well as Video S1 and S2).

These results suggest that TBEV significantly accelerated apoptosis in Caco-2 cells in the late phase of infection. Thus, in the early phase of infection (up to 2 days p.i.) no evidence for apoptosis induction was obtained and TER of the Caco-2 monolayers remained unaffected indicating an intact epithelial barrier. Therefore, virus translocation in the early phase of infection points to virus transcytosis. Whereas the decline in the integrity of the monolayer after 4 days p.i., as measured by a reduction in TER (Figure 6B) and an increase in apoptosis ratio (Figure 6D) as well as cytoskeletal (Figure 4A) and subsequent tight junction changes (Figure S2, Video S3), suggests an additional route of virus translocation via the paracellular pathway.",

Virus trafficking via macropinosomes was recently described for a growing number of viruses from other families such as echovirus [39], lentiviral HIV [40], or as reviewed for Vaccinia virus, Adenovirus 3, Coxsackievirus B, and Herpes simplex virus 1 etc. [28]. Several lines of evidence indicate that the TBEV internalization by Caco-2 cells is associated with macropinocytosis: (i) TBEV was detected in mid-sized vesicles of approximately 200 to 500 nm by EM in Caco-2 cells. These observations also revealed the virus particles probably assemble in the rER [41]. (ii) Intracellular trafficking of TBEV containing vesicles was mediated by e.g. SNX5 signaling, which regulates the formation and maturation of macropinosomes [23]. Also EEA1 presented evidence for early endosomes in co-localization with TBEV. (iii) Inhibition of actin- or microtubule-dependent cytoskeleton polarization blocked virus particle trafficking and the inhibition of PI3K signaling also blocked virus uptake. (iv) Inhibition experiments with EIPA and fluid uptake assays of infected Caco-2 cells provide further evidence for a macropinocytosis mechanism. All these findings support the hypothesis that uptake of viral particles is mediated by the process of macropinocysis. Since the reduction in virus endocytosis in these experiment was partial, the evaluation of e.g. clathrin-mediated endocytosis by other specific inhibitors is up to further investigations.",

We now postulate that TBEV transmission and translocation into the organism can occur via the small intestine, but this remains to be experimentally confirmed by an animal infection model. Although some cases of TBEV infection of lab workers by aerosols were described, when cell culture flask containing high amounts of virus were broken in the incubator [42], TBEV transmission via the respiratory tract or oropharyngeal epithelial cells needs to be further investigated. In addition, oral experimental infection of animals resulted in a TBEV infection after an incubation time of several days [11], [12]. TBEV can resist to gastric juice that showed the possibility of alimentary TBEV infection [13]. Furthermore, other viruses such as HIV and EBV can induce persistent infections after oral transmission in animal models [43], [44]. Therefore, it is reasonable that virus translocation via the small intestine is a possible route when humans consume unpasteurized milk products. Milk-borne infections and translocation across tight human epithelial barriers were also reported for other virus, as e.g. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) [45]. Furthermore, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from maternal milk was shown [46]. Milk as a vehicle for pathogen transmission is often observed and milk or its products protect pathogens to survive in the gastric acidic environment in order to get access to enterocytes. As the buffer capacity of milk and milk products is quite high, antibacterial or antiviral activity of the gastric juice is lowered when consuming milk, especially in young children or person with low gastric secretion [47]. Therefore, the gastric passage of pathogens (even in case of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori) depends on the susceptibility of the hosts as well as on the type of the diet [47].",

            "text": "In our experimental infection model, the beginning structural changes of the cytoskeleton and vacuolization in the early phase lead to further developed pathological changes in the late phase of infection. Although we cannot completely exclude virus translocation e.g. via apoptotic leaks, we found indications that the epithelium was not hampered in its integrity up to 48 h p.i. Thus, we conclude that virus particles were released via exocytosis. However, after prolonged incubation time up to 5 days p.i. apoptosis ratio was massively increased in infected cell monolayers. Concomitantly, TER decreases after 4 days and was lowered to the half of the initial value at day 5. Therefore, paracellular virus translocation through the epithelial barrier may occur in the late phase of infection in the leaky epithelium. The induction of apoptosis by cytokine production, as shown for cytokine-containing supernatants of HIV-infected cells may also contribute to the barrier defect [48]. Moreover, we found additional pathological changes in late TBEV infection like the subcellular distribution of tight junction proteins in single areas of infected Caco-2 monolayers that can promote virus translocation via the paracellular pathway (Figure S2). These kind of focal barrier defects were prominently observed in infection models of bacterial enteric pathogens e.g. Yersinia enterocolitica\n[49], Campylobacter concisus\n[50] or Escherichia coli 536 [51]. The drop in TER by TBEV can be assigned to the massive induction of apoptosis in the late phase of infection, but also re-distribution of barrier-forming tight junction proteins may contribute to the epithelial barrier defect. The lowered epithelial barrier function together with apoptosis induction were induced by the virus directly and/or by the host response to the infection (e.g. cytokine induction) likewise shown for infection of the small intestine by other viruses, e.g. astrovirus or HIV [48], [52]. Pathological apoptosis induction can influence TER and increase permeability of the epithelium for macromolecules up to 4 kDa [50], [53]. Thus, a passive uptake mechanism into the organism for virus translocation and on the other hand the loss of solutes and water (diarrhea) is supposedly a further pathogenic features of TBEV infection. Similarly, the pathogenic mechanisms in the human small intestine during norovirus infection could be described by epithelial apoptosis induction and tight junction dysregulation [54]. Moreover, the norovirus p20 protein showed interference with epithelial restitution mechanisms when stably transfected into HT-29/B6 colon cells [55]. Likewise tight junction disruption caused by the capsid of the West Nile virus was found in Caco-2 monolayers [56]. From HIV infection it is known that the enteric immune cells were the site of virus progeny and that the HIV causes GI symptoms per se in the acute phase of infection (HIV enteropathy), thereby both apoptosis induction and tight junction changes contribute to the diarrhea [57]. Thus, it is supposable that the GI tract may also serve as the site for TBEV propagation and dissemination.",

            "text": "As TBEV can translocate via the transcellular as well as the paracellular pathway, the entry of the virus into the organism may lead to a systemic infection and subsequently infection of the nervous system. It was demonstrated that TBEV lead to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in experimental infected mice [35]. Moreover, another report showed that TBEV infection of rat astrocytes did not influence their cell viability [34]. These studies, together with our findings, indicated that both transcellular as well as paracellular translocation of the virus can occur during infection. The mechanisms by which the viruses perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier by transcytosis and paracellular translocation (e.g. over apoptotic leaks) is also supposable for virus translocation through the endothelial blood-brain barrier. The tight junction can be involved in virus endocytosis and replication. For example the Hepatitis C virus exploits the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 as receptors for cell entry into liver cells [58]. In our cell model we did not find any co-localization of TBEV and tight junction or other apical membrane compartments such as lipid-rafts (data not shown), thus a cellular receptor for TBEV entry remains unknown. As Melik and co-workers reported that PDZ-domains might be important for TBEV replication and assembly [59], it is supposable that PDZ-motives of tight junction proteins (e.g. occludin) would be used by the virus and thereby tight junctional dysregulation may be induced. However, tight junction dysregulation by the virus has to be determined separately from apoptosis induction, which can facilitate tight junction changes alone. For further research, the cellular defense mechanisms (clearance of virus particles) in low-dose TEBV-infected epithelial cells are worthwhile to proceed. In preliminary experiments low infectious doses did not affect epithelial integrity nor resulted in high replication rates as seen with MOI above 0.1 (data not shown). Therefore, a possible transmission of TBEV between the cells via actin filament rearrangement should be considered for upcoming observations which seem to play an important role in TBEV infection [60]. Taken together, TBEV is able to translocate through the intestinal epithelial barrier providing evidence that virus infection can occur via the alimentary route. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, TBEV entry into intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by macropincytosis and replication of virus leads to high virus titers in apical and basal compartments. Future studies should confirm the findings on barrier breaking properties of TBEV infection on epithelial and endothelial borders in animal models and clinical observations.",
