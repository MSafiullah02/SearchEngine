Thus, we suggest that politicians, governments and healthcare providers avoid the recommendation of HCQ prophylactic treatment to the public without evidence-based information, and critically appraise upcoming studies on COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis before formulating guidelines. We encourage individuals to avoid purchasing HCQ without prescriptions and medical consultations, since self-medicating can lead to accidental overdoses. Further research is required with transparent reporting of adverse effects, to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ as a prophylactic agent for COVID-19.",

A Timeline of Evidence\". 1 After thoroughly summarizing the literature studies on the efficacy and safety of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), they rightly concluded that there is currently no robust evidence to support prescribing HCQ as a treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19. As they mentioned, the United States President, Donald Trump, tweeted on March 21, 2020 that HCQ and azithromycin \"taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\" and further urged that these drugs \"be put in use IMMEDIATELY. PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST.\" 1, 2 Furthermore, on March 22, 2020, the National Task force of India for COVID-19 recommended that high-risk individuals -asymptomatic healthcare workers of laboratory suspected or confirmed cases and household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases -be placed on a 400 mg/week dose of HCQ prophylaxis for 7 weeks. 3 We would like to bring attention to the dangerous medical consequences of these endorsements by guideline recommendations and institutional leaders, which have led to asymptomatic individuals using HCQ without prescriptions and without awareness of the serious side effects of this drug. This is a serious potential risk, especially since consuming higher than standard doses can lead to fatal outcomes.",
