Mass spectrometry laboratory technology has been modified to achieve quick bacteria typing of aerosols in the field. Initially, aerosol material was collected and subjected off-line to minimum sample treatment and mass spectrometry analysis. More recently, sampling and analysis were combined in a single process for the real-time analysis of bio-aerosols in the field. This chapter discusses the development of technology for the mass spectrometry of bio-aerosols, with a focus on bacteria aerosols. Merits and drawbacks of the various technologies and their typing signatures are discussed. The chapter concludes with a brief view of future developments in bio-aerosol mass spectrometry.",

            "text": "Real-time detection of biological material with absolute identity determination is the stuff of science fiction. In this case, science fiction actually represents the \"market pull\" that challenges a \"technology push.\" As concerns the real-time analysis of biological aerosols, the challenge was taken up in the mid 1980s, when some of the technology seemed sufficiently mature for integration in a universally applicable real-time bio-aerosol mass spectrometer. Two decades later, direct bio-aerosol mass spectrometry is still in the early stages of technology development, with research going on in a few select institutes. In the same two decades, the \"market pull\" of science fiction was fortified by an increasing awareness of biological threat, propelled by possibly emerging pandemics (e.g., Perdue and Swayne 2005; Glass and Becker 2006) , and by the fear of bioterrorist attacks (e.g., Hamburg 2002; Tegnell et al. 2006) . By now, mass spectrometry (MS) has proven capable of producing complicated spectral signatures from biological materials within seconds. This positions MS as a core technology for meeting the challenge of bio-aerosol detection with adequate differentiation of detected agents. This chapter gives an overview of several lines of MS technology development and of the current state-of-theart in real-time bio-aerosol MS. After the previous two decades of early technology development, the next five years will see the evolution of mature MS-based bio-aerosol detection.",

The information gained by MS can range from the profiling of intact cells to the detail of proteomics or nucleotide sequencing. However, chemical analysis by MS is an emerging method with respect to established microbiological typing methods, like serotyping, microscopy, and phage typing. Where identity of organisms is discussed between analytical chemists and microbiologists, misunderstanding often arises from a difference in perception of \"identity\" between the two disciplines. This issue is briefly addressed in the first subsection, to clarify the point that the many approaches to the identification of bacteria correspond to various levels of certainty. The second subsection gives a brief, non-exhaustive overview of applications of MS to the analysis of whole cell material from bacteria, with emphasis on aspects of potential screening and detection technology.",

            "text": "The understanding of \"identity\" in microbiology differs considerably from that of chemistry. In chemistry, identity is assigned on the basis of comparison of molecular structure, for example by spectroscopic methods. Although we like to think that live material is also subject to the rigidity of molecular structure, the adaptive and evolutionary qualities of life imply a certain fuzziness in chemical composition. Historically, classical microbiology and bacteriology set out to assign microorganism identity by descriptive comparison of a selected set of observable characteristics. These characteristics would be morphological, for example colony shape in culturing or cell shape in microscopy. Later methods of typing employed indirectly observable characteristics, for example particular enzymatic activity, chemical resistance or affinity, or immunological activity. With the advent of chemical methods of analysis, typing would also address parts of the chemical composition of microorganisms, like fatty acid distribution or excreted metabolites. The molecular biology revolution, which started around 1980, has provided typing methods based on hereditary properties as these are addressed through the analysis of DNA. It is envisaged that molecular biology may provide a Grand Unification Theory for typing of microorganisms. That will also resolve the practical problem of the evolution of \"standards\" because the abstract information can be documented on paper rather than in a collection of organisms. However, where the link between DNA sequence and biological function is still largely elusive, molecular biology cannot yet accomplish unification by the incorporation of existing typing schemes.",

Studies employing multiple typing methods provide a link between the separate dimensions, often on an empirical basis. For example, if a bacteriophage susceptibility profile is obtained from a specifically serotyped Salmonella isolate, a single mapping term is established between bacteriophage typing and serotyping. If mapping from a given typing method to other typing methods is not available, that typing method remains subjective. For practical purposes, for example in epidemiological comparison of bacterial strains from an outbreak, that subjectivity may be sufficient. When the identification problem is limited to a \"threat list,\" subjectivity will be insufficient. Even when the typing profiles of all organisms on the \"threat list\" are acquired, it remains to be proven that no organisms on the list give the profile of one of the threat agents. For typing in any environment, a link to objective information, generally a DNA sequence, is eventually required to overcome the typing method dimension problem.",

For bacteria, this problem was approached by the application of MS/MS or by a minimum sample pretreatment. An example characteristic accessible by MS/MS is dipicolinic acid (DPA). This compound makes up 5-15 % of a Bacillus spore, and as such it is representative for the possible presence of Bacillus anthracis. Specific pyMS based methods for detecting Bacillus through DPA were developed (Beverly et al. 1996; Goodacre et al. 2000; Tripathi, Maswadeh, and Snyder 2001) . Tandem mass spectrometry was employed to show that a more general characteristic of bacteria, their fatty acid profile, is accessible by pyMS/MS without prior chromatographic separation (DeLuca et al. 1990) . A fast in situ chemical methylation reaction, to form fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), is included to allow better volatilization (Basile et al. 1998; Barshick, Wolf, and Vass 1999; Tripathi, Maswadeh, and Snyder 2001; Poerschmann et al. 2005) . Although FAME profiling does not provide a complete typing scheme for bacteria, correlation with laboratory profiles can be employed in detection applications. Thus, the targeting of specific components by pyMS through MS/MS or fast in situ sample treatment obviates the need for elaborate full spectrum matching in detection.",

Bacterial growth conditions are beyond experimental control, at least in a real detection environment, but their effect on the variability of spectra has triggered further study. For example, it was observed that number and intensity of peaks varied considerably among spectra when E. coli K12 bacteria were sampled at selected stages between 6 to 84 h after inoculation of a culture (Arnold et al. 1999) . However, the general trend is that protein fingerprinting in whole cell MALDI provides adequate identification despite the innate variability (e.g., Valentine et al. 2005; Wunschel et al. 2005a) .

Most of the data analysis research focuses on the processing of spectra as \"fingerprints.\" Because similar fingerprint type processing is also used in pyMS, procedures can be adapted for the purpose. However, plain spectrum fingerprint matching discards the more hidden information from the bacterial genome. The observed high-mass signals, over 1000 Da, are generally taken to represent peptides and proteins of which the mass is determined by the amino acid sequence. Therefore, these signals are considered \"biomarkers\" of the investigated bacteria. The biomarker link to genomes provides a more objective kind of information , from a sequence database that is essentially independent of any analytical method. The notion of biomarkers implies that there is a potential for the kind of spectrum prediction that obviates the need for library accumulation. At present, fingerprinting is the established way for bacteria typing by MALDI MS, and the link to genome information is still under investigation. Both approaches are briefly discussed below.",

Raw spectra are rarely used as fingerprints, and several condensation methods have been reported, for example cross-correlation (Arnold and Reilly 1998) and extraction of numerical fingerprints (Jarman et al. 1999; Jarman et al. 2000) . Actual spectrum comparison is then achieved by methods also employed in matching of pyMS spectra, for example in the neural network approach demonstrated with SELDI (Schmid et al. 2005) . The accumulation of a well-defined set of library spectra, possibly in a condensed form, is an elaborate job. However, it is generally assumed that translation of fingerprint data to other instruments and conditions is possible. This assumption was studied in an objective way by consideration of the protein distribution against the significance of an identification, for a limited set of organisms (Pineda et al. 2000) . It was concluded that the cluttered and incomplete nature of the spectral data, as compared to bacterial proteomes, complicates or even compromises truly robust identification. At a practical level, the assumption of cross-instrument translation is supported by a single published interlaboratory study, which showed that tight control of sample treatment and of instrument conditions allows translation of MALDI MS fingerprints between instruments (Wunschel et al. 2005b ). The assumption is further corroborated by the development of two commercially available MALDI MS platforms with libraries for bacteria typing: from Waters (employed, e.g., by Keys et al. 2004 ) and from Bruker (employed, e.g., by Maier et al. 2006) . Although theoretical considerations and practical experience have not yet fully resolved the issue of method robustness, bacterial fingerprinting has become fairly well established as a method for bacteria typing in a laboratory setting and with a certain level of prior knowledge about target bacteria, for example in the screening for dairy pathogens.",

Later studies provided more substantial evidence, for example for the identity of certain proteins from Bacillus spores (Hathout et al. 1999) or independent proof of protein identity for specific MALDI MS signals (e.g., Hathout et al. 2003; Dickinson et al. 2004 ). On the basis of this sporadic approach it was proposed by the group of Fenselau that it would be most likely that basic proteins, like many of the ribosomal proteins, are responsible for biomarker signals (Pineda et al. 2003) . The proposal was corroborated by experiments that showed it is tenable as a working hypothesis, provided that post-translational modification of the proteins is accounted for . Although this working hypothesis does not have any absolute predictive value, the basic protein approach is the most generalized proposal for biomarker attribution to date.",

LDI was typically used for samples applied to a surface, and to direct surface analysis. In LDI, the ionizing laser energy is dissipated by the sample material and the corresponding energy density is generally so high that covalent chemical bonds easily dissociate. This laser ablation process burns away minute amounts of sample material. Therefore, a laser desorption spectrum will generally show signals of native ions such as Na + and NO \u2212 3 , and of atomic cluster ions such as C + 3 and C 3 H \u2212 , formed from the organic or biological compounds present. A typical example of such a spectrum is shown in Fig. 36.4 . The high energy density in LDI makes the method less suitable for the ionization of relatively thermolabile organic and biochemical compounds. Nevertheless, occasional reports of successful LDI analysis of such compounds have appeared (see, for example, Balasanmugam et al. 1986; Posthumus et al. 1978) . In many cases, the ionization of such thermolabile compounds involved preformed cationized and anionized species (Cotter 1981; Balasanmugam et al. 1981; Zakett et al. 1981) .",

Initially, the capability for analysis of deposited aerosol particles was oddly reported among biomedical applications (Kaufman, Hillenkamp, and Wechsung 1979) , but LAMMA was then quickly adopted by aerosol investigators (Wieser, Wurster, and Seiler 1988) . The initial studies concerned technology development, for example for measuring the elemental composition of micron size particles (e.g., Bruynseels and Van Grieken 1984) . This technology was then applied in atmospheric aerosol research (e.g., Bruynseels et al. 1988; Dierck et al. 1992; Hara et al. 1996) . These aerosol studies generally encompassed inorganic analysis, where the particle size range investigated was set by the aerosol fraction trapped by the offline sampler. In these studies, LAMMA MS is typically used for the analysis of the low Z elements, such as C, N, and S. Other methods, like electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPXMA), turned out to be more suitable for the higher Z-elements, such as heavy metals (e.g., Van Malderen, Hoornaert, and Van Grieken 1996) . Although only a single LAMMA study was reported in recent years, the available aerosol sampling technology and offline LAMMA analysis in a remote laboratory provided many new insights in environmental aerosol chemistry.",

SELDI is the sophisticated, often commercialized variant of earlier academic experiments with on-target sample preparation (e.g., Brockman and Orlando 1995; Liang et al. 1998; Bundy and Fenselau 1999) for MALDI. The SELDI chip that serves as the laser target is coated with specific affinity molecules to allow on-target cleanup before matrix application and actual MS. Mass spectra are then obtained from any material retained by the affinity surface, for a rapid characterization of target material captured from the original sample. The chip technology makes SELDI particularly useful for quick screening of large amounts of samples, for example in clinical diagnosis of cancer by biomarkers (recently reviewed in Engwegen et al. 2006 ) and for bacteria typing (e.g. Schmid et al. 2005; Al Dahouk et al. 2006 ).",

However, the required particle collection provided a cross-section picture of a certain particle size class, but any particle concentration information got lost in the process. In a separate development, Sinha et al. constructed an aerosol mass spectrometer for the analysis of individual particles. A beam of particles was continuously fed into the source of a quadrupole (Q) mass spectrometer, with in-source pyrolysis by a heated filament and electron ionization (Sinha et al. 1985) . A key problem is that Q type mass analyzers require a constant ion input for a time span in the order of one second during a full mass range scan, whereas single particle ionization produces only a short burst of ions during a period in the order of a millisecond. This problem was resolved by using the Q mass spectrometer as a band pass filter at a width of a few mass units. By stepping through multiple bands the 40-300 Da mass range was covered. This yielded mass spectra from a bacteria aerosol (Fig. 36.5) , where a single spectrum would have required ionization of over 10 5 bacteria containing particles. This kind of sensitivity and mass range are not practically useful, but the work provided a most important proof of principle.",

To our knowledge, there is only a single line of development based on off-line aerosol entrapment and subsequent MALDI MS. In the mid 1990s it was demonstrated that a TOF mass spectrometer with a flight tube of a few centimeters long can have the performance of an instrument with a flight tube of over 1 meter in length (Cornish and Cotter 1992; Bryden et al. 1995) . This small TOF mass spectrometer was the basis for interfacing with aerosol sampling and MALDI, as it was developed at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL) and described in a patent (Anderson and Carlson 1999; Anderson et al. 2003) . Typically, aerosol is sampled onto a tape by an aerosol sample collector, where the sampling determines the overall duty cycle for detection. After completion of a sampling/deposition cycle, a matrix is applied and the tape is interfaced with the mass spectrometer by a sealable opening. With the sample spot on the tape in the correct position inside the mass spectrometer source, a common MALDI MS experiment can be conducted. Investigations on the performance of this system were not published in peerreviewed journals, but aspects of system development were covered in JHU publications (e.g., Antoine et al. 2004 ). Although it is hardly possible to come to an evaluation of sensitivity and performance of this aerosol MALDI TOF MS system on the basis of the scant literature data, it is obvious that the technology has the full potential of MALDI MS for the identification of bacteria.",

A typical design for a single particle MS instrument is given in Fig. 36 .7 (Van Wuijckhuijse et al. 1998 ). Environmental aerosol is sampled into the mass spectrometer vacuum through a differentially pumped beam generator. The emerging particle beam is made to pass a low power continuous wave laser beam, where every single particle gives light scattering. The scattered light is detected and employed to fire a high power pulsed excimer UV laser, in order to ionize the particulate material. As the ionization events are located in the source of a TOF mass spectrometer, the ionization laser shot is also used to mark the start of the TOF MS process. Because this experimental set-up only allowed analysis of particles with a certain pre-set size, the demonstrator instruments served as a starting point for further exploration, pursued by several research groups.",

Ionization was accomplished with the help of a 266 nm pulsed UV laser, for which it was considered that 266 nm coincides with the UV absorption maximum of the dipicolinic acid that is abundant in such spores. In a later study it was shown that the fluence threshold and the beam profile of the ionization laser are of prime importance to the spectrum quality and abundance . Data analysis in the Bacillus study showed that m/z 74 + and m/z 173 \u2212 ions provided the main discriminant signals, where the positive ions were proposed to originate from trimethylglycine ) and the negative ions from free arginine (Fergenson et al. 2004 ). However the robustness of these marker signals turned out to depend on the micro-organism growth conditions: Different growth conditions lowered the probability of detection of B. atropheus from 93 to 73 %, whereas the distinction from B. thuringiensis was lost (Fergenson et al. 2004) . Specifically for B. atropheus, the impact of growth on the particle mass spectrum was investigated in more depth (Tobias et al. 2006) . It was also shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be distinguished from Bacillus cereus, B. atropheus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis, with a single marker signal as the determinant . The observed negative ion marker, m/z 421 \u2212 , was tentatively attributed to a sulfolipid precursor earlier identified by independent methods as a component of the M. tuberculosis. Although there are just a few of these micro-organism studies, it is obvious that the focus in research on single particle LDI MS has shifted from technology exploration and development to the originally envisaged applications.",

For single particle MS, this step is relatively easy when a matrix compound is mixed with the sample, prior to aerosolization. This was demonstrated with aerosols of bradykinin, gramicidin S, and myoglobin and -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Murray et al. 1996) , of leucine and of peptides (enkephalin and gramicidin S) mixed with several matrix compounds (Mansoori, Johnston, and Wexler, 1996) and with aerosols of gramicidin S with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as the matrix (Weiss 1997) . At that time, the mass range and some other equipment limitations of typical single particle LDI mass spectrometers did not allow a full exploration of the premixed matrix approach. In addition, premixing of the matrix had little relevance in environmental aerosol research and in bio-aerosol detection. However, in the development of bio-analytical MS for laboratory applications there is a need for online coupling of MALDI MS with liquid flows from continuous separation methods (Foret and Preisler 2002; Gelp\u00ed 2002) , for example with liquid chromatography (Murray et al. 1996; Preisler, Foret, and Karger 1998; Miliotis et al. 2000) or capillary electrophoresis (Zhang and Caprioli 1996) . Therefore, the development of single particle MALDI MS follows two lines of sample treatment, either with matrix premixing prior to aerosolization or with online, in-flight coating of aerosol particles.",

With various matrix compounds and several UV wavelengths employed, it is reported that the required matrix-to-analyte ratio lies between 10:1 and 1000:1 (Beeson, Murray, and Russell 1995; Mansoori, Johnston, and Wexler, 1996; He and Murray 1999) . Although the quantity in a single particle of pure analyte lies between 100 amol and 10 fmol, the analyte loss by interfacing through aerosolization implies that the overall analysis method is relatively insensitive. However, this analyte loss depends strongly on the design of the interface, and actual numbers for the analyte loss are not available. Because MALDI MS of deposited material does not ionize all of the deposited analyte, aerosol MALDI MS is still able to compete favorably. At present, chromatography interfacing to mass spectrometry is still in the research stage of development.",

            "text": "Analysis of environmental bio-aerosol particles by single particle MALDI MS requires inflight coating. Particle coating has found application in existing technology (see, e.g., Agarwal and Sem 1980) . In principle, matrix coating by condensation can be accomplished by subsequent particle passage through a warm saturated vapor and a cold zone (Fig. 36.9 ). Upon cooling, the oversaturated vapor condenses on the aerosol particles, which are the only available condensation nuclei. These coated particles are then analyzed by a single particle TOF mass spectrometer (Stowers et al. 2000; Jackson, Mishra, and Murray 2004) . In the coating process, the final particle size depends on the initial size, the temperature difference between hot and cold zone, the aerosol number concentration, and the sampling rate. These parameters were employed to tune the matrix-to-analyte ratio to produce MALDI mass spectra of acceptable quality. In a proof of principle, spectra were obtained from Gramicidine S and from Bacillus subtilis var niger (known as BG), and BG signals were tentatively assigned to peptidoglycan typical for BG cells (Stowers et al. 2000) . This proof of principle showed that single particle MALDI TOF MS is possible. The initial equipment was augmented with new ion optics to extend the mass range, and with a triggering mechanism for selective ionization of biological particles (Stowers et al. 2002; Van Wuijckhuijse et al. 2005a and . The earlier observations for BG were reproduced and additional signals were found in the 6000-7500 Da mass range. The improvements allowed regeistration of mass spectra in the 1 to 30 kDa range found relevant to whole cell bacteria typing in common MALDI (see above). Biflex III MALDI mass spectrometer 337 nm ionization laser, average of 100 shots; Bruker Daltonics; Bremen, Germany) on two different direct MALDI ATOFMS instruments (middle: Delft University of Technology instrument with 308 nm ionization; bottom: instrument at TNO, with 337 nm ionization; both average of \u223c1000 single particle spectra); vertical lines represent the mass spectrum peak list. Over the last year, work has been going on to improve matrix coating, to become reproducible, and to build a prototype transportable system (Lok, 2007; Van Wuijckhuijse et al. in preparation) . This will show whether single particle MALDI MS gives signatures that compare to those from whole cell MALDI MS in the laboratory. In a first step, Escherichia coli was prepared for a laboratory MALDI experiment by the common addition of matrix. Part of the crystallized material was collected and crushed to allow subsequent aerosolization. As it is shown in Fig. 36 .10, analysis of this material with two different aerosol TOF mass spectrometers and with a common laboratory instrument yielded similar spectra. Although this single experiment requires repetition with a few more organisms, the spectrum resemblance demonstrates that spectrum matching of spectra from a single particle MALDI MS instrument with those from common whole-cell MALDI MS will support bacterial typing. The improved performance of the present system (Van Wuijckhuijse in preparation) is also demonstrated by single particle MALDI MS averaged spectra from several Bacillus species: B. thuringiensis, BG, and B. cereus (Fig. 36.11 ). These 500 particle average spectra, evaluated in their entirety and not yet by biomarker signals, clearly discriminate between the three closely related Bacillus species, and they also discriminate between spores and vegetative cells.",

That tendency is driven by the potential applications, which all involve in situ measurement for quick and reliable detection: medical, environmental, as well as civil and military safety applications. Where potential military and civil safety bio-aerosol MS is pretty much limited to the scope of threat perception, medical and environmental bio-aerosol MS may open up a completely new view of the world. We will become able to \"see\" microorganisms in environments where we have been blind until now. Of course, this sense of science fiction translates into some practical requirements for science and technology development.

Given the fact that, so far, pyGC-ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) was developed for field bio-aerosol detection (Snyder et al. 2004) , the technology and chemistry of FAME pyMS can be further developed for bio-aerosol detection (Krebs et al. 2006; Prasad et al. 2006) . Changing from MS to IMS technology does resolve design issues with regard to size and transportability of the overall system. Although pyMS has the advantage that it does not include relatively vulnerable lasers, the use of laser ionization may greatly aid the selectivity in ionization of specific pyrolysis products. For example, photoionization was demonstrated for the analysis of polymers by pyMS (see, e.g., Zoller et al. 1999) , for the field analysis of chemical weapons agents (Syage, Hanning-Lee, and Hanold 2000) , and for the direct analysis of biological material (Evans, Hanold, and Syage 2000; Nies, Evans, and Syage 2003) . Alternatively, surface ionization might give useful results when applied to bio-aerosols. Surface ionization is already employed in aerosol MS (e.g., Jimenez et al. 2003) , but the published applications were limited to organic and inorganic aerosols. Simplification of the instrument by going from MS to IMS and application of other ionization modes, such as photoionization or surface ionization, may provide new signatures for the analysis of bio-aerosol components.",

            "text": "For all bio-aerosol MS technologies, downsizing is an important issue on the way to increased transportability. Downsizing applies to all of the component technologies integrated in a bio-aerosol mass spectrometer. Downsizing of the mass spectrometer has the additional benefit that smaller vacuum volumes require less pumping capacity and, hence, smaller pumps. The application of Ion Trap MS instead of TOF MS will sometimes be an option in downsizing, and we see Ion Trap MS (e.g., Harris, Reilly, and Whitten 2006) as a viable line of development in bio-aerosol MS. However, both types of mass spectrometer have proved amenable to downsizing, as has been reviewed by Badman and Cooks (2000) . Downsizing often involves application of different or refined physical principles, with a concomitant redesign of the mass analyzer. The application of higher order ion focusing and a redesign of the instrument has for example produced small \"end cap\" reflectron TOF instruments with capabilities comparable to those of common laboratory TOF instruments (e.g., Cornish and Cotter 1997; Fancher, Woods, and Cotter 2000) . A completely different way was pursued with the redesign of the reflectron from the common multistage to a single stage element (Uphoff, Muskat, and Grotemeyer 2004) . Also, developments in the manufacturing process have led to smaller TOF instruments, even down to suitcase size (Cornish, Ecelberger, and Brinckerhoff 2000; Ecelberger et al. 2004 ). Downsizing of Ion Traps to a hand-portable size was recently accomplished Gao et al. 2006) , although it should be noted that the mass range of such small Ion Traps is not yet compatible with high mass range applications. For either TOF or Ion Trap instruments, downsizing of the mass spectrometer will require tailoring to the specific application. Downsizing of laser systems will also drastically reduce the system size of LDI or MALDI bio-aerosol MS systems, with the additional benefit that smaller lasers require less cooling. The development of lasers is mainly driven by other applications, but more specific requirements for (aerosol) mass spectrometry have recently been pointed out in great detail (Holle et al. 2006; Murphy 2006) . In particular, the development of solid-state lasers with UV capability will help in downsizing bio-aerosol MS systems. Downsizing of laser equipment and mass analyzers will determine the overall system downsizing, because aerosol sampling and capture equipment will not be amenable to much downsizing given the required performance.",

Spectrum comparison with library spectra is a routine application, but actual identification of bacteria from spectra requires more research. For any of the bio-aerosol analysis methods applied to bacteria, robustness of the signature towards environmental factors and phenotype requires more research. The signatures obtained from pyMS and LDI approaches will not have sufficient distinctive capability for adequate identification, because the ionized material is essentially a far derivative of biological material. Nevertheless, in the analysis of bacterial bio-aerosols, pyMS and LDI signatures may be useful as indicators rather than identifiers. As for the MALDI MS approach to bio-aerosol analysis, the obtained signatures relate directly to bacterial biomolecules present. However, more research is required to establish the link between aerosol MALDI MS signature and bacterial biomolecules. On the basis of the current state of the art in laboratory MALDI MS of bacteria, direct aerosol MALDI MS has the potential to become a rapid identification method.",
