            "text": "Closely related to this debate, but more recently, a generalized model of Schl\u00f6gl II has been proposed where an arbitrary number of sources is necessary to induce a transition [8] . The study of the model's mean-field critical behavior led the authors to conjecture that such general failure-recovery dynamics belong to the Ising universality class [9] . This model is of particular interest since it not only includes simple contagions but also complex contagion phenomena such as the diffusion of innovations [10,11], political mobilization [12] , and viral marketing [13] that require social reinforcement, i.e., the connection to multiple sources [14, 15] . The model displays an intricate and very rich dynamics including hysteresis effects, limit cycles, and cusp catastrophes [9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Thus, a unifying mean-field theory of the critical behavior is essential for a broad range of dynamical systems. However, the relation to contact process dynamics and cusp catastrophes has only been shown for specific values of the model's parameters [20] . But, given the model's parameter regime, can we generally predict the dynamics type? And does the model's mean-field critical behavior belong to the Ising universality class or not? Here we answer these questions and analytically demonstrate that the mean-field critical behavior of the model is restricted to only three possible regimes: (a) uncorrelated spontaneous transition dynamics, (b) contact process dynamics, and (c) cusp catastrophes. Cusp catastrophes can display abrupt transitions and hysteresis effects-phenomena that can harm the proper functioning of real-world networked systems since small variations in the system's control parameters may cause catastrophic transitions from a seemingly well-functioning state to global malfunction or severe outages [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

            "text": "Closely related to this debate, but more recently, a generalized model of Schl\u00f6gl II has been proposed where an arbitrary number of sources is necessary to induce a transition [8] . The study of the model's mean-field critical behavior led the authors to conjecture that such general failure-recovery dynamics belong to the Ising universality class [9] . This model is of particular interest since it not only includes simple contagions but also complex contagion phenomena such as the diffusion of innovations [10, 11] , political mobilization [12] , and viral marketing [13] that require social reinforcement, i.e., the connection to multiple sources [14, 15] . The model displays an intricate and very rich dynamics including hysteresis effects, limit cycles, and cusp catastrophes [9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Thus, a unifying mean-field theory of the critical behavior is essential for a broad range of dynamical systems. However, the relation to contact process dynamics and cusp catastrophes has only been shown for specific values of the model's parameters [20] . But, given the model's parameter regime, can we generally predict the dynamics type? And does the model's mean-field critical behavior belong to the Ising universality class or not? Here we answer these questions and analytically demonstrate that the mean-field critical behavior of the model is restricted to only three possible regimes: (a) uncorrelated spontaneous transition dynamics, (b) contact process dynamics, and (c) cusp catastrophes. Cusp catastrophes can display abrupt transitions and hysteresis effects-phenomena that can harm the proper functioning of real-world networked systems since small variations in the system's control parameters may cause catastrophic transitions from a seemingly well-functioning state to global malfunction or severe outages [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

Three fundamental processes define the transitions between these two states [9, 20] : (i) nodes undergo a spontaneous transition A \u2192 X from an active (A) to an inactive state (X) in a time interval dt with probability pdt; (ii) if fewer than or equal to m nearest neighbors of a node are active, the node becomes inactive (Y) due to an induced transition, i.e., A \u2192 Y, with probability rdt, and (iii) a spontaneous reverse transition with probability qdt if X \u2192 A or probability q 0 dt if Y \u2192 A. The inactive states X and Y only differ in their reverse transitions and are equivalent if q \u00bc q 0 . Process (ii) describes that a node with degree k can become inactive if its number of inactive neighbors is larger or equal to k \u2212 m. Similar to threshold models describing complex contagion phenomena, the threshold m defines the number of contacts to inactive nodes that is necessary to induce a transition as defined by process (ii) [14, [31] [32] [33] . A low value of m corresponds to the situation where many inactive neighbors are required to sustain spreading. In contrast, for a large value of m only a few inactive neighbors can sustain the spreading process. Processes (i)-(iii) are illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

In order to study the influence of different threshold values m on the mean-field critical behavior of Eqs. (1) and (2), we consider a regular network with degree k, i.e., the degree distribution f k 0 \u00bc \u03b4 kk 0 . We demonstrate below that the model defined by processes (i)-(iii) can only exhibit three different regimes depending on the choice of m. It is important to notice that for more general degree distributions the mean-field critical behavior still falls into these classes; see Supplemental Material [35] . The coupled equations (1) and (2) admit oscillatory behavior for q 0 > q [20] as a dynamical feature that does not belong to the critical behavior [18] . The equations describing the critical behavior, i.e., _ u spon \u00bc 0 and _ u ind \u00bc 0, can be decoupled by multiplying one of them with an appropriate constant excluding limit cycles [18]tantamount to setting q \u00bc q 0 \u00bc 1.

Inside this hysteresis region two stable fixed points coexist. Phase switching is observed when fluctuations in systems of finite size push the dynamics close to the unstable fixed point, cf., Fig. 2 (right) .

The waiting times thus depend on the fluctuation strength and the distance from one phase to the unstable state in the phase portrait, cf., Fig. 2 (right) .

This scenario typically implies dramatic and uncontrollable global transitions in the network for many systems involving complex contagion dynamics. One could naively expect that it could be beneficial for failure control to design systems such that a component only fails if many of its neighbors already failed, i.e., delaying the failure dynamics. Our results suggest, however, that this delaying procedure might facilitate uncontrollable transitions, hence achieving exactly the opposite as initially intended. This result agrees well with previous findings on delaying procedures that have been applied to a SIS model [44, 45] . For low spatial dimensions or highly structured networks, the assumptions of perfect mixing or independent node-to-node interactions are not guaranteed. Still mean-field approximations qualitatively describe a given dynamics [3, 4, 46] ; see examples given in Supplemental Material [35] .",

Our results suggest studying these processes within our more general framework that incorporates contact processlike adoption as one special case and can account for spreading that relies on multiple contacts. For vanishing p, a second-order phase transition from an absorbing to an active phase occurs at r c . For a positive value of p, the transition gets smeared out [3, 38] . (Bottom panel) For all m < k \u2212 1, cusp catastrophes define the phase space. Two in the thermodynamic limit stable states coexist inside the hysteresis region (II) that is surrounded by bifurcation lines (black solid lines) merging at the cusp point \u00f0r 0 ; p 0 \u00de. Outside the hysteresis region (I) only one stable state exists. The critical point r c is defined as the transition point for vanishing p. ",
