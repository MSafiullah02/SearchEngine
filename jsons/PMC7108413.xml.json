            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious atypical pneumonia that caused an epidemic between November 2002 and July 2003 with a 9.6% mortality rate (8096 known cases and 774 deaths) (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/). While the SARS-CoV epidemic has subsided, the closely related Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is still presenting severe public health threats locally and globally. Generation of effective anti-viral therapeutic and detection agents is warranted, and the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, which mediates viral entry and initiates viral infection, represents attractive drug development target. The SARS-CoV surface spike (S) glycoprotein is composed of the surface-exposed S1 subunit and the transmembrane S2 subunit which further hetero-trimerize on the viral envelope, a characteristic structural prerequisite for Class I fusion glycoproteins to facilitate viral entry (Fig. 1\n) (Bosch et al., 2003; Xiao and Dimitrov, 2004). Specifically, following the recognition of the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the surface S1 subunit, structural changes are induced within the S2 subunit, exposing the fusion peptide (FP) within S2 and enabling it to be inserted into the target cell membranes. This leads to the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) regions C-terminal to the FP to oligomerize in an antiparallel fashion with the more C-terminal HR2 regions of the S protein trimers, resulting in a coiled-coil structure, i.e., the six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion cores (Bosch et al., 2003). The 6-HB structure is further strengthened by hetero-dimerization of the hydrophobic regions flanking the two HRs, specifically the membrane proximal external region (MPER) and the S2 internal fusion peptide (IFP) (Guillen et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2015). Collectively, the opposing viral and cellular membranes are juxtaposed into proximity for the subsequent fusion and viral entry (Bosch et al., 2003).",

            "text": "One of the approaches to generate anti-viral therapeutics has been focused on self-binding peptides. Self-binding peptides bind to their cognate proteins through sequence-specific interactions (Beisswenger and Cabrele, 2014; Hard and Lendel, 2012), with examples including Leu/Ile zipper sequences in coiled-coil motifs (Hakoshima, 2001; Perutz, 1994), cross-\u03b2 spine steric zipper sequences (abbreviated as steric \u03b2-zipper) in amyloid and amyloid-like fibrils (Nelson et al., 2005; Parry, 2005; Sawaya et al., 2007), and aromatic-residue-rich sequences in aromatic zippers (Cochran et al., 2001), among others. Their abilities to conduct sequence-specific interactions have been exploited and been further developed into peptidyl therapeutics and biochemical reagents (Azzarito et al., 2013; Hakoshima, 2001). For anti-viral applications, Leu/Ile zipper-like sequences within HRs have successfully been developed as entry inhibitors against infections such as the human immunodeficiency virus type I and SARS-CoV (Borrego et al., 2013; Bosch et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005, 2004; Medinas et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2011; Wild et al., 1994; Yao and Compans, 1996; Young et al., 1999). Specifically, the HR-derived Leu/Ile zipper-like peptides can bind to the fusion glycoprotein in a dominant-negative fashion, and thereby halt the viral entry and infection.",

The globular S1 subunit is structurally different from S2 subunit, and is largely composed of \u03b2-sheets, such as within the RBD (Giannecchini et al., 2005). Logically, identification of zipper-like sequences within the S1 subunit should focus on \u03b2-zipper-like motifs, which include steric \u03b2-zippers. These complementary, dry, puzzle-like interfaces, form between as few as four and as many as seven tightly interdigitating side chains of two facing peptide \u03b2-sheets (Azriel and Gazit, 2001; Balbach et al., 2000; Balbirnie et al., 2001; Nelson et al., 2005; Reches et al., 2002; Tenidis et al., 2000; von Bergen et al., 2000). Self-binding peptides containing this motif have been shown to recognize and homo-dimerize with the same sequence within amyloid-like fibrils and then inhibit the fibrillation process (Hard and Lendel, 2012). This suggests that the steric beta-zipper sequences within a viral fusion glycoprotein, such as SARS-CoV S protein, could also bind to the cognate viral fusion protein through homophilic interaction, and could further serve as a biochemical reagent for viral detection and/or as anti-viral therapeutics.",

Firstly, putative self-binding peptides were identified by screening a peptide array library that was composed of overlapping peptides covering the entire length of S protein (Kaukinen et al., 2003; Rigter et al., 2007; Uttamchandani and Yao, 2008). The identified peptides were further analyzed by the 3D profile method to predict the steric \u03b2-zipper segments. Subsequently, a peptide that potentially oligomerized through forming steric \u03b2-zippers was identified experimentally and further used to detect S protein expression in vitro. Finally, we could demonstrate the differential influences of peptide lengths on \u03b2- or helix-mediated interactions. Altogether, these data suggest that endogenous steric \u03b2-zipper peptides within viral fusion proteins, such as SARS-CoV S protein, could be a practical source for developing detection reagents against viral infections.",

Accordingly, peptide GG38, encompassing the entire S protein HR2 sequence (aa 1149-1186), both oligomerized into \u03b1 helix trimers and heteromerized with the HR1 peptide into the 6-HB (Bosch et al., 2004; Celigoy et al., 2011) (S3 Fig.). The discrepancy between the known oligomerization potential of the HR sequences and their underrepresentation among self-binding peptides identified in this study may be due to that our peptide array of 20-aa length, which while well suited to identify short-sequence-mediated self-interactions (e.g. steric \u03b2-zipper), is inadequate to sustain helix-mediated interactions. This was confirmed by the diminished ability of HR2-derived peptides to pull down S1188HA, when subjected to serial C-terminal truncation (S4 Fig.) (Jiang and Lin, 1995).",

These eight peptides were chosen based on their relatively high affinity to S1188HA in peptide array screening and their inclusion of the consensus self-binding sequences (Table 2\n). Peptide D4A (302 to 321 aa) contained the sequence shifted downstream from the scanning-identified D4 sequence, to facilitate peptide synthesis and purification. The scanning-identified H18 sequence contained an N-terminal cysteine residue. To investigate if the H18-S protein interaction was mediated through disulfide bond formation, peptide H18A (743 to 762 aa) with sequence shifted downstream from the H18 by two residues was generated. Peptide J1A (866 to 888 aa) contained sequences of the overlapping J1 and J2 peptides that were identified from the 15-residue and 20-residue peptide array library, respectively. Finally, peptide K2A contains sequences of the overlapping K2 and K3 sequences, while K4A contains sequences of the overlapping K4 and K5 sequences. Each of these eight peptides was entirely or largely composed of sequences identified from peptide array scanning, where the specificities of their interactions with S1188HA were ensured by including continuous overlapping peptides. Therefore, no scrambled peptide was included in the subsequent pull down experiments. Finally, peptide GG38 (aa 1149-1186), which was derived from the oligomerizing S protein HR2 sequence, served as the positive control for the S protein-derived self-binding peptide in the following pull down experiments.",

By using S1188HA-containing lysate pretreated with PNGase F that removes the N-linked glycans, we could show that all eight peptides pulled down the PNGase-F-treated S1188HA, similarly to the control peptide GG38, suggesting that these peptides bound to the S protein through amino acid sequence- but not glycan-mediated interactions (Fig. 2a). We further observed that the peptides C6, E11, K2A and K4A, and the positive control peptide GG38 pulled down greater amount of S1188HA, when the cell lysates were pre-treated with their respective non-biotinylated analogues (Fig. 2b). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the peptides C6, E11, K2A and K4A contained oligomerization sequences, as does the positive control HR2 peptide GG38, which contains a trimerizing sequence (Celigoy et al., 2011; Hakansson-McReynolds et al., 2006). The potential oligomerization sequences within C6, E11, K2A and K4A could enable the non-biotinylated peptides to bind to S1188HA during pre-treatment, and further serve as oligomerization sites for their biotinylated analogues during pull down experiments. These oligomerization sequences within the non-biotinylated peptides would be more exposed and accessible than the corresponding region within S1188HA, which could serve as a \u2018bridge\u2019 between the biotinylated peptides and S1188HA and thereby lead to an enhanced retention of S1188HA.",

Furthermore, most of them have been shown to contain potential antigenic epitopes, which further confirms that these sequences are located in the accessible regions on the S protein (S1 Table) (Duan et al., 2005; Greenough et al., 2005; He et al., 2006, 2005; He et al., 2004). Their homophilic-interaction potential and the accessibility of their corresponding regions on the S protein indicated that these peptides could bind to S protein during viral infection and potentially be used as viral detection reagents, particularly if the peptide-S protein interactions are maintained through sequence-specific interactions such as the \u03b2-zipper motifs within amyloid-like fibrils. Indeed, amyloid-derived steric \u03b2-zipper peptides have been shown to specifically bind to the cognate amyloid protein through oligomerization with the corresponding sequence within the protein (Hard and Lendel, 2012).",

Subsequently, the structural profile and fibrillation behavior of C6 was investigated, using CD spectroscopy and Congo red and thioflavin T (ThT) spectroscopic assays, respectively. Peptide C6 was dissolved at 10 mg/ml, a relatively high concentration that could accelerate nucleation stage and allow the observation of fibrillation within the experiment time-span of three days (Teng and Eisenberg, 2009). It has been previously shown that amyloid-like fibrils could bind to Congo Red, resulting in characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light and enhanced absorbance at 540 nm (Nilsson, 2004). It is shown here that peptide C6, upon 3-day incubation, exhibited an increase of absorbance at 540 nm when mixed with Congo Red, suggesting its Congo red-binding and fibrillation formation behavior (Fig. 3b). The incubated peptide C6 also resulted in an approximately 2.5 times increase of the fluorescence emission at 482 nm when mixed with ThT, another characteristic behavior of amyloid fibrils (Biancalana and Koide, 2010; Nilsson, 2004), further confirming its ability to form amyloid-like fibrils (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, CD spectroscopy study revealed that C6 adopts a \u03b2-strand conformation in aqueous environment, supporting its ability to form \u03b2-strand-containing structures such as the \u03b2-zipper (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, the other potentially amyloidogenic peptide E11 did not demonstrate these amyloid-like characteristics (S6 Fig.).",

            "text": "Taking advantage of its self-interacting amyloidogenic behavior, C6 was further applied to detect S protein expression by fluorescence staining in 293 T cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line permissive to SARS-CoV infection (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004). The 293 T cells transiently expressing an HA-tagged full-length S protein, were stained with either anti-HA (Y-11) primary antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 4\na, panel \u2018anti-HA\u2019), or with 2 \u03bcM of the biotinylated peptide C6 followed by Dylight 488-conjugated Neutravidin\u2122 (Fig. 4a, panel \u20182\u03bcM C6\u2019). The staining pattern of anti-HA antibody targeting the S protein, and that of fluorescence-conjugated Neutravidin\u2122 targeting the C6 peptide, were found to co-localize (Fig. 4a). The cells expressing high levels of the S protein were also bound extensively by peptide C6 (Fig. 4a). We further applied C6 and anti-S antibody separately to detect the expression of an un-tagged full-length S protein (S1255). 293 T cells transiently expressing S1255 were subjected to fluorescence staining using either a conventional mouse anti-S monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody and then an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody, or using a 2 \u03bcM peptide C6 followed by Dylight 488-conjugated Neutravidin\u2122. Control cells were probed with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody or Neutravidin\u2122 alone. C6 detected S1255 expression in 293 T cells, with the staining pattern and intensity similar to that obtained with the anti-S monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4b). As our first step to enhance the binding avidity of peptide C6 to S1188HA, C6 was homo-dimerized on a biotinylated Lys-based linker molecule, a strategy that has been applied successfully in enhancing the peptide immunogenicity and anti-viral potency (Fig. 5\na) (Tam, 1988; Tam et al., 2002). The dimeric C6 peptide, C6-D, formed visible fibril-like aggregates upon four to five days of incubation at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 5b). However, such aggregates were not observed in C6 monomer when incubated for the same duration at 4 \u00b0C. Furthermore, in the pull down experiment, peptide C6-D retained approximately 2.5 times higher amount of S1188HA than C6 (Fig. 5c). Collectively, the data indicate that the dimeric C6-D had a higher propensity for oligomerization and a stronger affinity towards the S protein, as compared to the monomeric C6, which warrants further investigation of C6-D as a detection reagent for S protein expression.",
