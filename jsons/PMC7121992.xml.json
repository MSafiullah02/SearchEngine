He is started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline per community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines and admitted to the medicine service. Five days into the hospitalization, the patient decompensates and ultimately requires intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Blood and sputum cultures are unrevealing. Urinary antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are negative. While in the intensive care unit, the patient continues to spike fevers. Blood cultures are obtained again but remain negative. The antimicrobial coverage is broadened to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Eventually, the patient is extubated and transferred back to the general medical floor. He is eventually narrowed to amoxicillin/clavulanate. He is discharged to a short-term rehabilitation facility still requiring two liters of oxygen.\n",

Regarding the pathogen, one probes the clinical history for susceptibilities and characteristic syndromes\u2014for example, a background of chronic alcoholism or poorly treated HIV will point to aspiration pneumonia and opportunistic infections, respectively. The patient\u2019s clinical course is also closely observed in-house for clues to an etiology, for example, rapid response to empiric antibiotics indicating infection.",

In the case of pneumonia, the basic defining features include a radiographic infiltrate, systemic signs of infection (e.g., fever), and pulmonary symptoms of infection (e.g., productive cough, SOB, and occasionally pleuritic chest pain) [4]. Unfortunately, in practice, these historical features may be insufficient and potentially misleading as they may manifest in completely different disease processes, many of which do not require antibiotics. These include decompensated heart failure (SOB), pulmonary embolism (pleuritic chest pain), COPD exacerbation (SOB and cough), and even allergic rhinitis (fatigue, malaise, productive cough). Furthermore, studies have shown that history has poor interobserver reliability in the ability to record symptoms in patients with suspected pneumonia. For instance, the classic amalgam of fever, cough, tachycardia, and crackles has a sensitivity of less than 50% for the diagnosis of acute pneumonia, and no other constellation of historical and physical findings has performed better [5].",

Equally poor results are seen in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, in whom only 50% of pathogens are identified [7].

In response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and inflammatory cytokines during infection, however, the expression of procalcitonin is upregulated in virtually every tissue and cell type [57]. Importantly, its expression is suppressed by type I interferons generated during viral infection, improving its specificity for bacterial etiologies. Serum levels elevate rapidly (within ~4 hours) and peak around 24\u201348 hours, making it an excellent early marker for infection [58]. Compared with CRP, it has been shown to be more sensitive and specific in identifying bacterial infections [59]. Also, unlike other infectious markers, its level is neither decreased (as is CRP) nor increased (as is white blood cell count) by the use of steroids [60]. An important drawback, however, is its lack of sensitivity for atypical infections such as Legionella, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydophilia [61].",

Although numerous reports have shown the efficacy of procalcitonin-guided prescribing strategies in decreasing antibiotic usage, questions have lingered regarding safety. To address these questions, Schuetz et al. conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis, including studies across a variety of clinical settings including primary care, emergency departments, and the ICU. The study not only confirmed dramatic reductions in antibiotic exposure and safety, but in fact showed that procalcitonin-guided strategies improve clinical outcomes in terms of mortality and treatment failure [69].",

Notable associations have been made with polymorphisms in pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) [86]. Additionally, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-related genes have been shown to confer either resistance or susceptibility to Streptococcal infection; for instance, mutations in the toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and the NF-kappaB pathway have been identified as protective [87].",

Using bacterial pneumonia as an example, pathogens access alveoli and trigger immune responses through the elaboration of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which activate pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) and production of inflammatory cytokines. Pathogens also damage lung tissue directly, in some cases leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In general, procalcitonin is secreted during bacterial and not viral infections. Bacterial lung infections can also result in systemic inflammation characterized by acute phase response and production of C-reactive protein (CRP), fever, multiorgan failure, vasoplegia, and vascular permeability that presents as sepsis",
