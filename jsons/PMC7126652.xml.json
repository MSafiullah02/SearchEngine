Since the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015, hospitals at various levels have announced visiting hours. They have also installed glass sliding doors to block infection routes. However, pediatric wards are an exception; they issue one access card per pediatric patient to authorize access to guardians for reasons such as mental security of hospitalized children and consent for treatment procedures. Given that young children are more likely to cross-infections in ambulatory settings and hospitalized facilities (Buet et al., 2013; McBride, 2018), visitors (family and non-family) must engage in minimum health behaviors for infection prevention before entering pediatric wards. The easiest prevention measure is engaging in hand hygiene using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.",

However, the HHC of participants increased significantly when visual stimulation was provided (2.3%), and even more when audio-visual stimulation was provided (3.8%) (Fisher's exact, p < .05).
