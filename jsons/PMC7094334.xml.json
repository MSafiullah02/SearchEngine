By May 2003, the disease outbreak spread worldwide affecting thousands of individuals, resulting in 764 deaths. The causative agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel CoV (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus), was recognized at the end of February 2003 and declared a global threat to health by WHO. This disease is highly contagious, and if SARS-CoV maintains its pathogenicity and transmissibility, it could become the first severe new disease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential.",

The Coronaviridae family contains enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases in human and animals. Their genome of around 30 kb is the largest found in RNA viruses, encoding 23 putative proteins, which include 4 major structural proteins: Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and small envelope (E). The Spike protein is a large membrane glycoprotein that forms 180- to 190-kDa peplomers that bind to receptors on CoV-susceptible cells and induce cell fusion. S protein is also a well-known neutralizing antigen of many coronavirus (Homberger, 1994, Jackwood and Hilt, 1995, Callebaut et al., 1996, Gomez et al., 1998). SARS Spike protein has a low level of similarity [20% to 27% pairwise amino acid (a.a.) identity] when compared to Spike proteins of other CoV (Lu et al., 2004).",

Although it is more sensitive and specific than a serological assay, the drawback of using real-time RT-PCR is that the equipment is very expensive. Differences in optimization of RNA extraction, delays in processing specimens, and deterioration of samples may further lower the efficiency of the assay. These drawbacks make real-time RT-PCR a difficult procedure to use in the majority of clinical laboratories, especially those in developing countries.",

            "text": "Currently, the more commonly used diagnostic assay for the detection of SARS-CoV is the detection of antibodies by immunoflourescence assay (IFA). IFA is recognized as the \u201cgold standard\u201d (Tang et al., 2004). It uses inactivated SARS-CoV-infected cells fixed on a slide as antigen to detect SARS antibody in serum samples. It is known that conventional whole virus IFA can detect positive SARS-CoV infection using sera collected as early as 8 days. However, conventional whole virus IFA is not so convenient since it initially utilizes infectious SARS-CoV to infect cell culture before fixating on the slides. Although the inactivated IFA slides can be handled in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories, the initial infection procedure needs to be carried out in a BSL-3 research facility. This makes the whole virus IFA difficult to perform in most laboratories, as there is a risk of contamination when dealing with live virus. Due to the current problems and safety issues with the whole virus IFA, a safer serological assay with little risk of contamination is needed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. This has led to the development of Nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA and immunoblot assays. However, until recently, little information has been available to evaluate Spike protein-based immunoassays for the detection of specific antibodies in SARS patients.",

Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome shows that this virus does not belong to any of the three classes described above, although it has the same genome organization as other coronaviruses. Further interpretation suggests that SARS-CoV proteins share low homology with other known coronaviruses (Rota et al., 2003). The SARS-CoV Spike gene encodes a glycoprotein of approximately 150 kDa containing 1255 amino acids, which is normally cleaved into an S1 domain and an S2 domain (Jackwood et al., 2001). Recently, an angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-recognizing site has been identified in the Spike protein S1 domain as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV in humans (Li et al., 2003). The Spike protein may mediate membrane fusion and induce neutralization antibodies in the host, raising the possibility that antibodies against the SARS-CoV Spike protein may be a good marker for early detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV infections.",

We have compared the sequences of our protein C, 441 to 700 a.a. of Spike protein with the ACE2 recognizing site and found that the ACE2 recognition domain is overlapping in our protein C. This sequence is found in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein and has a high affinity to ACE2. This ACE2 recognition domain is important as it grants SARS-CoV the ability to bind and mediate virus entry in cells, causing infection and hence inducing an early immune response. Because protein C overlaps with the ACE2 recognition site, we believe that antibody against protein C may be a good candidate for the development of effective and sensitive detection assays for SARS-CoV. In this study, we are the first to show that the immunogenic protein C-based IFA is a sensitive and specific method for detecting SARS-CoV infection.",

Further localization studies using an inverted confocal microscope showed that protein C was localized in the cytoplasm of Sf-9 cells, thus forming a \u201cring\u201d fluorescence pattern (Fig. 1b). However, in terms of sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV antibody in serum samples, our Spike protein-based IFA utilized one-tenth of the serum used in the commercial IFA. We have conducted experiments to optimize the conditions used for the IFA and we have identified the best dilution of serum (data not shown). We found that the Spike protein-based IFA can detect SARS-CoV specific antibody at a lower dilution of 1:100, compared to the 1:10 dilution for commercial and conventional IFAs. This might be due to the overexpression of protein C in our system. Thus, our Spike protein-based IFA is more sensitive compared to the existing IFAs. Moreover, protein C is able to mimic the antigenicity of the whole SARS-CoV although it was developed on the basis of a truncated immunogenic fragment, from 441 to 700 a.a. of Spike protein. Future development of an assay with protein C of the Spike protein will now be possible.",
