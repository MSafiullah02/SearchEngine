However, the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria that exist in many of these countries remains incompletely characterized. The aim of this study was to examine the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria associated with acute respiratory infection in children under the age of 16. Methods: A total of 10 435 serum sera specimens were collected from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect immunoglobulin M antibodies against nine common pathogens: mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila, coxiella burnetii and chamydophila pneumonia. Results: Of the 10 435 specimens examined, 7046 tested positive for at least one pathogen. Among all of the tested pathogens, mycoplasma pneumonia had the highest detection rate (56.9%). Influenza virus A and influenza virus B epidemics occurred during both winter and summer. The detection rate of respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus was higher in spring. Cases of mixed infection were more complex: 4136 specimens (39.6%) tested positive for \u22652 pathogens. There were statistically significant difference in detection rates of mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila and chamydophila pneumonia among different age groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The most common pathogens causing acute respiratory infection among children in Hubei of China were mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B and respiratory syncytial virus.

Most cases of death caused by ARI are found in the developing world. 1 Between 2000 and 2003, over two million children under the age of 5 died from ARI, with 75% of these deaths occurred in Africa or Southeast Asia. 2 Worldwide for children under the age of 5, ARI (including pneumonia) accounts for 18% of deaths. 3 Therefore, whether in developing or developed countries, ARI is a cause of tremendous human and economic burdens to families and society as a whole. 4, 5 Currently, it is widely considered that the major pathogens responsible for ARI are bacteria, [6] [7] [8] although atypical bacteria (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP)) and viruses also play crucial roles. In particular, during acute upper respiratory tract infections, the infection rates of MP and viruses (mainly influenza virus B (FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and adenovirus (ADV)) can be even higher than those of bacterial pathogens. In addition, new viruses are being discovered, such as human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses (NL63 and HKU1). 9, 10 Many studies have also shown that MP and viruses display seasonal variations in infection and that mixed infections with multiple pathogens are common. Furthermore, many viruses show high infectivity, rapid transmission, short latency and acute manifestations; and they may also fail to induce lifelong immunity following diseases. The characteristics of these pathogens can lead to high morbidity and mortality, as well as disease pandemics. 11, 12 Hence, the detection of viruses and atypical bacteria is crucially important.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 193, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 340, "end": 341, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 439, "end": 440, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 590, "end": 592, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 593, "end": 594, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 689, "end": 692, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 693, "end": 696, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 697, "end": 700, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1186, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1189, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1639, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The symptoms of respiratory viral infection and atypical bacterial infection in children are very similar and show no specificity.

This finding is consistent with the results of Chan et al. 27 and demonstrates that this disease can have epidemic during the winter and spring as well as summer.

Climate is an important factor.

Among mixed infections with two pathogens, the MP+FluB and FluB+RSV combinations were the most common. In a similar study, Peng et al. 28 showed that FluA+FluB was the most common mode. The reason may be that MP, FluB and RSV were the most common pathogens of single infection; besides, there may be some similarities in their epidemic season. Mixed infection is likely the result of damage to airway mucosal cells caused by a prior pathogen (such as MP), allowing other pathogens to infect a patient. Mixed infections may also be associated with the relatively poor health and immune function of children, the long course of certain diseases, long hospitalizations or physical contact with other patients. It is also important to be aware that the detection rate of mixed infection is very dependent on methodology 29 and how many types of pathogens are being studied. We found that the detection rates between the different age groups were significantly different and that the <1-year-old group had the lowest rate. The detection rates for MP were the highest for each age group, which was significantly higher than that reported by a previous study, 1, 20 but similar to that reported by Liu et al. 30 In general, MP is more prevalent among older children 1, 31 The detection rates of FluB observed in this study were much higher than those reported elsewhere; 32, 33 in addition, the detection rates for the different age groups also showed significant differences, with the detection rate in the 3-6year-old group being the highest. The detection rates of RSV in the different age groups were significantly different, with the highest detection rate being seen in the 3-6-year-old group; however, our RSV detection rates were higher than those of earlier studies. 34, 35 The LOS was affected by many factors, such as the pathogen species, the timeliness of treatment, the hospital medical level, the children's family economic status and the individual differences with regard to medication; but most important was the pathogen species. Therefore, the LOS of children was analysed according to the pathogens responsible for the infection. A difference in the virulence of pathogens may lead to differences in LOS.
