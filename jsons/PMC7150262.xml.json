            "text": "Throughout history, infectious diseases have vastly impacted human civilization. This impact has been demonstrated by the relentless appearance of various infectious disease outbreaks, including plague that scourged Europe during the Middle Ages, yellow fever that decimated Napoleon's forces in Haiti during the early nineteenth century, and influenza that claimed the lives of as many as 50 million people in 1918 (Zietz and Dunkelberg, 2004; Patterson, 1992; Johnson and Mueller, 2002). In the twentieth century, public health knowledge and interventions increased, particularly in more developed countries, reducing the burden of infectious diseases (Armstrong et al., 1999). Industrialization and urbanization influenced improvements in sanitation, structural development (e.g., window screening), and vector control that collectively lowered transmission rates by reducing the population's contact with infectious agents (Armstrong et al., 1999). In addition, the discovery of penicillin in 1928 and the continual development of vaccines ushered in an age of treatment and prevention strategies that many believed could eradicate infectious diseases from the globe (Clardy et al., 2009; 1999).",

A well-known example comes from the Rockefeller Foundation, an organization that allocated substantial resources in the early twentieth century to combat yellow fever in the United States and other highly impacted territories, efforts that established precedence for future work (Fosdick, 1989). After World War II, new health organizations were established, including the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO) that led multiple campaigns to completely eradicate specific infectious diseases. One of the most notable efforts was the vaccination campaign against smallpox, a highly infectious viral disease that was completely eradicated by 1980 (Henderson, 2009). These campaigns established a great confidence and optimism in the ability to combat and control infectious diseases worldwide.",

Currently, it is estimated that at least 25% of total global mortality is attributable to infectious diseases, translating into over 15 million deaths per year (Mathers et al., 2008). The majority of deaths occur among children less than 5 years of age, living in countries with low to middle incomes (Mathers et al., 2008). Certain diseases have greater mortality, such as acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, malaria, measles, and HIV/AIDS, which account for 9 out of every 10 infectious disease deaths (2001).",

            "text": "Data from the past 30 years reflect various degrees of resurgence or reemergence of different infectious diseases worldwide. Two important examples of this phenomenon include the increased incidence of wild-type poliomyelitis across geographic pockets of Northern Africa, as well as an increase in the number of individuals being infected by the mosquito-borne disease caused by dengue viruses. Additionally, novel infectious diseases continue to emerge in virtually every region of the world. Examples include Hendra virus, discovered in 1994 in Australia (Murray et al., 1995); Nipah virus, identified in 1999 as the causative agent of outbreaks among pig farmers in Malaysia (Chua et al., 2000); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) responsible for an outbreak of respiratory disease in multiple countries in 2003 (Marra et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003); and the 2009 emergence of a new influenza strain, originating in North America, responsible for the first pandemic of the twenty-first century (2009b). In public health, these types of events are referred to as emerging or reemerging infectious diseases, or collectively known as emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). EIDs have been defined as infections that are newly recognized in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range (Morse, 2004; Morens et al., 2004; Fauci, 2005, 2001; Institute of Medicine (US). Committee on Emerging Microbial Threats to Health et al., 1992). EIDs can be considered emerging, recently reemerging/resurging, or deliberately emerging, depending upon the pathway of emergence (Morse, 2004; Fauci, 2005; Morens et al., 2008).",

A number of recent bioterrorism events have had a dramatic impact on public health policies and resource allocations. New research and technology have provided better detection and response capabilities, as well as basic general knowledge of the various factors and determinants affecting the emergence and spread of EIDs; however, much is still unknown. This article offers a review of the most relevant literature associated with EIDs, as well as perspectives on how to address the most critical future public health questions.",

For example, a piece of fruit that is grown in Chile today can be purchased in a market on the other side of the world in 1\u20132 days. EIDs travel via these rapid global transport systems as made evident by the frequent international foodborne epidemics and zoonotic disease outbreaks that have occurred over the past few decades. SARS in 2003 demonstrated how quickly a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen can be spread, originating in China, and making its way to more than 15 countries in just a few months (Shen et al., 2004). Another example is the cholera outbreak that began in Haiti following a devastating earthquake in 2010, with genomic evidence suggesting that the epidemic Vibrio strain that ignited the outbreak was likely carried into the country by foreign security forces (Keim et al., 2011; Chin et al., 2011; Pun, 2011; Piarroux et al., 2011; Ali et al., 2011). These types of events make control extremely difficult, reflecting how quickly EIDs can be transmitted and established in new populations before public health officials can intervene.",

Poverty both promotes and results from social determinants including access to health care, clean water, food, and other important environmental factors that influence disease transmission (Marmot, 2005).

Pathogens have coevolved with vectors to exploit this behavior, often relying on transmission to allow for the propagation of new progeny. An example of a model vector that does this is the mosquito, which is the most widely distributed and abundant vector in the world.

For JE, humans are dead-end hosts, capable of infection if bitten by an infected mosquito, but unable to amplify and transmit the virus further, whereas, swine and other wild birds are able to propagate the virus and maintain a complete transmission cycle.

An ecological relationship could be as simple as the symbiosis of certain types of fungus and plants where no other factors play a role in the survival of everyone. Others can be much more complicated, such as the multistage life cycle of the guinea worm (cause of the disease dracunculiasis), a parasitic nematode that uses two different species, a copepod and humans, to complete its life cycle.

Deer and small mammals play an important role in the life cycle of ticks that vector the spirochete causing Lyme disease. Studies have shown that host populations directly correspond to tick abundance, often influenced by ecological factors that promote population growth (Levi et al., 2012). When this is coupled with urbanization and reforestation, transmission can drastically increase, since both the host and environment serve as the drivers for disease emergence.",

Just in the last 20 years, new variants of influenza have caused major human outbreaks, including HPAI subtype H5N1, first detected in 1997 (1997) and the pandemic influenza subtype H1N1, first detected in 2009 (2009a). Influenza A contains two surface proteins (glycoproteins), called hemaglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA): HA proteins are associated with viral attachment and cell entry using a fusion pathway, while NA proteins regulate the release of progeny virus from an infected cell. Antigenic drift and shift are two mechanisms that create variations in the antigenic properties of these two proteins that allow influenza A to bypass the acquired immunity of a population, Figure 4\n. Antigenic drift occurs when small point mutations accumulate gradually, altering the antigenic properties of the two surface proteins. This can cause population immunity to partially decrease, resulting in seasonal epidemics. Antigenic shift involves major changes in proteins, sometimes through the swapping of entire gene segments. The genetic reassortment occurs when two or more unique viruses infect the same cell and generate mixed progeny viruses (Chen and Deng, 2009; Kaye and Pringle, 2005). In particular, genetic reassortments of the HA antigens may result in large worldwide epidemics or pandemics. Waterfowl are thought to be the largest source of diverse viruses from which gene reassortment may occur, as they are known to carry viruses with 16 different HA proteins. When a population has no or little immunity to a new subtype and the new subtype is highly transmissible, pandemics may result.",
