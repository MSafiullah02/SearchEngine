However, an inefficient utilization of healthcare resources has been one of the major reasons for inflated spending on healthcare services [9]. This inefficient use of resources, in conjunction with a greater consciousness of the importance of healthcare system reform has led to more scrutiny of the cost effectiveness of healthcare delivery services [4], [10]. To promote cost-effectiveness, nearly 70% of US hospitals have implemented total quality management (TQM) and continual quality improvement (CQI) programs [11]. Bosworth et al. [12] validated that progress in quality improvement contributed to the productivity growth.",

Prior studies have shown the flexibility of DEA over traditional parametric methods in estimating hospital productivity [15], [16]. The Malmquist productivity change index can be used to track the specific position corresponding to each hospital and to examine changes in productivity and quality [17]. F\u00e4re et al. [18] advanced the Malmquist productivity index to measure changes in the following three components of productivity growth: quality change, efficiency change, and technical change. The use of the Malmquist productivity change index enables us to identify individual components of changes in hospital productivity, especially changes in efficiency and quality [17].",

The procedure of healthcare is logically divided into the above-mentioned three steps with individual indicators for performance evaluation and comparison. Traditional healthcare quality evaluation has focused on structural perspectives, such as hospital size, the quantity of facilities and equipment, and the quantity of services provided.

Due to such changes in organizational adjustment over time, short-term performance impact may differ from longer-term impact. For example, treatment cost may increase initially following quality improvement adoption because of changes in long-standing organizational routines and investment in data systems and other elements of QI infrastructure. However, organizational performance may, over a sufficiently long period of time, result in net savings and improved economic efficiency [24].",

With limited financial resources and growing patient demands, cost-efficiency concerns tend to prevail over quality considerations. There seems to be a constant debate over the trade-off between quality and efficiency. Currently, there does not seem to be any consensus on the link between quality elevation and efficiency improvement. Over the last decade, total quality management (TQM) has emerged as a possible solution to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare [26].",

However, there was only higher bed occupancy in lower quality hospitals. Harkey and Vraciu [30] discussed the relationship between quality and financial performance. They applied perceived quality, level of community wealth, hospital image, and scale as the independent variables, while marginal operational profit was treated as a dependent variable.

The scarcity of healthcare resources is particularly concerned in developing countries where poor health condition is one of the most important obstacles in the fight for economic development and welfare [39].

The Department of Health of Taiwan encouraged TQIP hospitals to collect and utilize the acute care indicators to facilitate improvements in healthcare quality and efficiency. After joining TQIP, hospitals are able to identify the non-value-adding processes, reduce costs, as well as obtain a thorough understanding of cost structure. They are also able to discover quality problems, comprehend the in-house quality status quo, improve data collection methods, and promote the quality philosophy. Therefore, we anticipate hospitals to improve their efficiency as well as productivity after joining the TQIP. We apply the Malmquist productivity change index to measure healthcare productivity change. The Malmquist productivity change index is decomposed into quality change, relative efficiency change, and technical change [18]. We anticipate the aggregate effect from the quality and efficiency progress would lead to productivity growth after the TQIP adaptation. Accordingly, we propose the following two research hypotheses:H2TQIP hospitals improve their efficiency in the post-TQIP period.\nH3TQIP hospitals improve their productivity in the post-TQIP period.\n",

Depending on their primary functions, hospitals in Taiwan are divided into three basic levels: medical centers, regional hospitals, and district hospitals. The reimbursement schedule under the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act, while uniform within a given level of hospitals, varies by the level of hospitals. The type of patients serviced (hospital output) also varies within these different levels of hospitals. To ensure greater homogeneity in performance evaluation across comparable units, and taking into account sample size variations, we focus on examining the productivity change only for regional hospitals. There are 31 regional hospitals (15 public hospitals and 16 private hospitals joined the TQIP program in 2000) that provided complete data on acute care indicators for the years in the pre-TQIP period (1998) and in the post-TQIP period (2002 and 2004).2\nIn 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) originated in Hong Kong and China. Taiwan also had 664 cases, including 346 contagions and 73 dead. SARS had an important impact on healthcare and economics for Taiwan.

The productivity improvement is 12.52% composed of the quality improved (10.62%), relative efficiency progressed (2.08%), and technical promoted (1.27%). Therefore, the overall improvement in productivity change, quality change, and relative efficiency change from 1998 to 2004 is lower compared to the progress in productivity change, quality change, and relative efficiency change from 1998 to 2002. This was attributable to the severe SARS impact in 2003. In 2003, SARS resulted in 346 contagions and 73 dead and had a serious impact on healthcare and economics of Taiwan. The public was reluctant to seek medical aids from hospitals until 2004.",

To evaluate our hypotheses, we test the Malmquist productivity index and its components for 1998\u20132002 and 1998\u20132004. We find that both the means of the quality change and relative efficiency change index are significantly less than one for the period of 1998\u20132002 (0.8645, 0.9712) and 1998\u20132004 (0.8938, 0.9792), indicating that TQIP hospitals improved their quality and efficiency in the post-TQIP period. In addition, the aggregate effects from the quality and efficiency progress have led to productivity growth after the TQIP adoption (0.7877, 0.8748). These evidence support H1, H2 and H3. That is, after joining TQIP, hospitals can identify the non-value-added process and reduce cost as well as thorough cost structure comprehension.",

In particular, we analyze the changes in efficiency and quality derived from the Malmquist productivity change index. Our results indicate that hospitals had improved their healthcare quality, efficiency, and total productivity from the pre-TQIP period (1998) to the post-TQIP implementation period (2002 and 2004).
