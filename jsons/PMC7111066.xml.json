Twenty-four hours post-infection, we collected the supernatants from the aforementioned cultures for plaque assays to determine the inhibitory effect of ATA on SARS-CoV replication. As shown in Fig. 1\n, in comparison with the untreated cells, more than 1000-fold inhibition of the virus replication was observed when the culture was treated with ATA at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml, while at least 100-fold inhibition at 0.4 mg/ml. Such inhibitory effect on viral replication could still be observed at 0.2 mg/ml, with viral replication level being 10 times lower than that of the control.",

However, the mechanism involved in its ability of inhibiting virus replication in those studies remains largely unknown, as is also the case in our current studies on SARS-CoV. The potency of ATA against SARS-CoV replication is also higher than that of the reported chemicals such as glycyrrhizin and recently reported nelfinavir [12], [20]; both drug candidates were reported to have two logs or less inhibition effect on SARS-CoV replication, while ATA showed more than three logs of inhibition effect. The biological activities of ATA have been demonstrated to be quite complicated, including inhibition of protein synthesis, prevention of the attachment of mRNA to ribosomes in cell-free systems, and suppression of enzymes involved in polynucleotide metabolism [21]. How ATA exerts its anti-SARS-CoV activities will require vigorous characterization. Our preliminary result indicated that ATA could inhibit SARS-CoV RNA synthesis (data not shown). Vaccine development could take years to complete and serious adverse reactions have been reported in other coronavirus vaccine studies, i.e., exacerbation of disease in animals received vaccines prior to infection [22]. Certain precautions have been proposed for the development of SARS-CoV vaccines due to potential detrimental effects [23], therefore the search for anti-SARS-CoV drugs must be pursued. Here, we report for the first time that ATA is a potent anti-SARS compound with low toxicity in tissue culture, suggesting that it could have therapeutic value for SARS in patients.",
