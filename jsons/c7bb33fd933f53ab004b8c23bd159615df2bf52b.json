Routinely MDA is responsible for operating over 1000 ambulances, 2500 salaried workers and 24,000 volunteers. By the end of January 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Health instructed MDA to act to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 and to prepare to respond to potential cases of infection. MDA then expanded the NMEDC and opened a dedicated COVID-19 call center. The goal is to contain viral exposure by keeping suspected patients in quarantine at home and away from the public. Upon excluding medical emergency, if the call is concerning COVID-19 and fulfills either the clinical or epidemiological criteria, it is transferred to the COVID-19 call center.",

Patients clearly not exposed to an index case, can return to their normal routine. If exposure is confirmed, they are instructed to stay in home quarantine (for 14 days) and a paramedic contacts them to inquire about symptoms. If the case is suspicious of COVID-19, a physician then decides whether to send a paramedic with personal protective equipment to the home to collect samples for testing. Over 25,000 samples have been collected. Cases, where COVID-19 are confirmed, are transported by paramedics on a dedicated negative-pressure hooded bed in an ambulance to the hospital.",
