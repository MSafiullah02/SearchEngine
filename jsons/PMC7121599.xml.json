During B cell maturation, this nonglycosylated hydrophobic phosphoprotein is first expressed on pre-B cells, but is lost during the final stage of maturation to plasma cells. In particular, CD20 is expressed in a subpopulation (about 30 %) of precursor B cells, in mature B lymphocytes, and in follicular dendritic reticulum cells. CD20 is also expressed by low-grade B cell NHL, precursor B cell neoplasms, precursor B-Lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, (B-LBL), HCL, B-CLL (weak), and by B-PLL. It is also present in lymphoplasmacytic cells in Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, but is absent in myeloma and B cell ALL.",

            "text": "Rituximab (formerly C2B8) is a glycosylated chimeric IgG1k murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the human CD20 antigen. The antibody has murine light- and heavy-chain variable regions and human constant region sequences. Rituximab was developed from the fully murine parent ibritumomab, which recognizes the same epitope. The basic effector mechanisms of this antibody are related to the Fc portion, and include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), mediated by one or more of the Fc\u03b3 receptors at the surface of granulocytes, macrophages, and NK cells. However, rituximab is also able to induce cell death via apoptosis, yet it is not clear which of these potential aggressive mechanisms are prevalent/effective in vivo. Administration of rituximab induces a rapid and massive destruction of circulating and tissue-based normal and malignant B cells. In some studies, depletion was evaluated by assessing the presence of residual B cells by another marker (CD19) and resulted being over 95 %. However, rituximab has no effect on hemopoietic progenitor cells and T cells. In hematologic malignancies, B cell depletion in circulation and in tissue localizations occurs within 3 weeks, and recovery begins in 6 months, reaching normal values within one year after treatment. In RA patients, there is an almost total depletion of circulating B cells within 2 weeks of treatment, lasting about 6 months and reaching normal levels within one year in most patients. A delayed recovery occurs, over 3 years after treatment, in a subgroup of subjects (4 %). Consequently, there is a reduction of both IgM and IgG serum levels, reaching concentrations below normal limits in 15\u201320 % of cases. A reduction of IgA was also observed in RA patients, being below normal levels in a minority of cases (<1 %). B cell depletion was also rapidly detectable in WG and MPA, and lasted up to one year [7, 8].",

For example, rituximab is effective in restoring platelet levels in immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITCP), but CDC and ADCC depleting action on B cells seems not sufficient to explain its action, since levels of antiplatelet autoantibodies remain virtually unchanged in these patients, while the platelet count increases rapidly. Among the proposed additional involved mechanisms, there is a saturating binding effect of rituximab-coated B cells to macrophages via Fc receptors, which may compete with platelet phagocytosis actively occurring in ITCP [9].",

            "text": "In a recent overview on anti-CD20 mAbs, five mechanisms of action were recognized, and the therapeutic mAbs were grouped according to their capacity to induce the reorganization of CD20 molecules into lipid rafts upon binding [10]. In particular, Type I antibodies induce the formation of lipid rafts and efficiently activate the classical pathway of the complement system, while Type II antibodies do not translocate CD20 into lipid drafts, yet induce cell death upon direct binding, and poorly activate complement. Both types are capable of inducing ADCC in the presence of effector cells. Rituximab is a Type I mAb and expresses the cytolytic action mainly by ADCC via Fc\u03b3R-expressing monocyte/macrophages, while CDC may play an additional role. In contrast, Type II mAbs, such as tositumomab, mostly act by direct apoptosis. These cytolytic functions may be differently expressed in various situations, being CDC more effective in circulation, where complement factors are highly represented, than on a solid tumor mass. Moreover, their efficacy varies in dependence of the tumor burden. In this case, multiple events are expected to be necessary in the presence of significant tumor masses. Further mechanisms are involved during therapy, such as the opsonization of mAb-covered targets mostly occurring as late effect. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and is not endocytosed during the antibody binding [8]. However, Type I mAbs can be internalized when bound to some Fc\u03b3R, more than Type II mAbs. As for rituximab, the internalization requires the cross-link between the Fc tail to Fc\u03b3RIIb, an ITIM-containing inhibitory receptor, and the Fab portion to CD20 on the same target cell. This mechanism is crucial in reducing therapeutic efficiency; it lowers the available amount of mAb at the target cell surface, necessary for effector cells recruiting, and drags the rituximab-CD20 complex into lysosomes for degradation. Interestingly, the expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb on different targets correlates with resistance to rituximab while the presence of Fc\u03b3RIIIa, the ITAM-containing stimulatory receptor, is related to mAb efficacy [11].",

            "text": "However, a genetic polymorphism of this receptor produces differences in the binding of IgG1, and subsequent activation of ADCC. In particular, homozygous valine in the position 158 exerts higher ADCC capacity with respect to heterozygous or homozygous phenylalanine alternatives in the same position. About 49 different Fc\u03b3RIIIa phenotypes have been identified in NHL patients showing differences in therapy response. Similarly, a correlation between B cell depletion induced by rituximab and receptor phenotype has been shown in SLE patients. Another mechanism potentially capable of influencing the therapeutic response is related to the rituximab-induced downregulation of IL-10 that enhances apoptosis and synergize with chemotherapeutic and steroid agents on the target [12]. Finally, rituximab seems to increase the number of Treg lymphocytes and prevents the activity of specific autoreactive T cells. These two additional mechanisms support in principle the administration of rituximab in autoimmune diseases. Overall, rituximab shows multiple and complex functions, which may explain the different target sensitivities and safety profiles under various clinical conditions. These mechanisms are shared with other anti-CD20 mAbs, but their efficiency is expressed with a different hierarchy among them. In fact, clinical experience indicates that cases of noncross-reactive resistance and synergistic effects between anti-CD20 mAbs and chemotherapy occur, and are possibly related to mechanistic diversities (see also 10.1007/978-88-470-5313-7_23, 29, 37).",

However, as a single agent rituximab is also used in patients with IgM-related peripheral neuropathy, with no concomitant evidence of symptomatic lymphoma. A peculiar drug-related AE is referred as hyperviscosity syndrome, caused by a transient increase of serum IgM levels, which usually almost returns to baseline level within 4 months. The syndrome is commonly expressed by local hemorrhage (epistaxis, gingival and retinal episodes), dizziness, and fatigue. The general safety profile in chemotherapy-associated treatment of Waldenstrom\u2019s disease is within the range of other lymphomas and includes hematologic (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) and nonhematologic signs (infusion reactions, constitutional signs, arrhythmias, etc.). In a recent study on 43 patients treated with multiple cycles of rituximab, fludrocortisone and cyclophosphamide, infusion reactions (49 %) were mostly mild and associated to first administration. One of them was severe and associated with rash. Major events included anemia (30 %), neutropenia (12 %), thrombocytopenia (3 %), nausea/vomiting (21 %), arrhythmia (5 %), dyspnea (2 %), biliary/liver dysfunction (2 %), and polyuria (2 %). Hyperviscosity syndrome was absent. However, there was at least one episode of severe neutropenia in about 88 % of patients during the study, and it was long lasting in 44 % of them. Two cases of severe thrombocytopenia and one of serious hemolytic anemia were also observed. A total of nine infections (six severe) including pneumonia (5) and sepsis (1), UTI (2) and Herpes zoster infection (1) were observed during treatment. Three additional cases of pneumonia were observed as tardive and two of them were associated to late neutropenia. One patient required hospitalization for pemphigus vulgaris.

During treatment with rituximab it was possible to discontinue steroids in 77 % of cases, and CsA in 60 % of the recipients. About 50 % of patients recovered from these drug-related events, including CsA resistance. In contrast, rituximab-related AEs were mostly mild infusion reactions expressed as constitutional signs, pyrexia, rash, cardiac frequency disorders, and blood pressure unbalance. Severe events were limited to one infection and two cases of late granulocytopenia recovered without sequelae. However, many patients relapsed, thus requiring repeated rituximab treatments and re-introduction of some immunosuppressive agents for maintenance [24].",

The intervention of different mechanisms of action may also be involved in diversity of expressions at local level, both in efficacy and safety, as well as in early versus late interventions. For example, CDC is more likely to cause early events in circulation, while internalization of rituximab-CD20 complexes may led to resistance episodes and more persistent late events.
