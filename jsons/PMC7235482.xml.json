To address this critical situation and to reduce the spread of the infections, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a series of decrees that imposed restrictions on the movement of individuals in the entire national territory from March 10 until May 3 (but these measures are likely to be extended). People are allowed to leave their homes for limited and documented purposes (e.g., shopping for basic necessities and to go to work [if this cannot be done from home]). Several activities have been temporarily closed, including schools, universities and shops selling non\u2010essential goods.",

Home confinement can reduce the level of physical activity and the exposure to daylight, and increase the level of stress due to social isolation (e.g., avoid social contact with family and friends) and the impossibility to engage in satisfying activity. These changes can impact the pace of the flow of time (Zakay, 2014), disrupt night\u2010time sleep (Altena et al., 2020) and increase the risk of mental health problems (Leigh\u2010Hunt et al., 2017). Sivertsen et al. (2019) have shown that young adults in a range between 18 and 35 years old tend to have a high and growing prevalence of sleep problems, and young adults make extensive use of social media devices that interact with daily activities, including sleep (Gradisar et al., 2013; Orzech, Grandner, Roane, & Carskadon, 2016). Social media platforms offer an opportunity to ameliorate social isolation, but the use of digital media near bedtime could have a broadly negative effect on sleep outcomes of young adults (Orzech et al., 2016).",

To achieve this, we administered a cross\u2010sectional survey to non\u2010hospitalized Italian residents. In this survey we asked participants to think about the previous week (March 17\u201323, which was the second week of the lockdown) and the period prior to the first week of February (February 3\u201310, before any restriction in any Italian area).",

The survey was shared via social media for a limited time window (from March 24 to 28, 2020), targeting people from 18 to 35 years old to obtain a homogenous sample of responders, because young adults (e.g., ages 18\u201335 years) are likely to be heavy digital users and they are especially at risk of sleep disturbance (Levenson, Shensa, Sidani, Colditz, & Primack, 2017; Sivertsen et al., 2019). There was no monetary or credit compensation for participating in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Centre for Research and Psychological Intervention (CERIP) of the University of Messina and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 1,342 participants completed the survey. From this sample, we excluded 26 participants who reported having been infected by COVID\u201019, 17 participants with age >35 or <18 years and one outlier. The final sample consisted of 1,310 young adults living in the Italian territory. Data reported in this study were part of a wider research project designed with multiple purposes regarding the psychological impact of home confinement in Italy, and other data with different purposes will be presented elsewhere.",

Nevertheless, already in the second week of the lockdown (March 17\u201323), sleep\u2013wake rhythms markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality.

As stated by a task force of the European CBT\u2010I Academy (Altena et al., 2020), during total lockdown individuals' sleep habits are challenged by several factors (i.e., reduced exposure to sunlight, reduced physical activity and psychological distress. We also think that the lack of social zeitgebers, such as regular work schedules and social activities, as well as changes in living conditions (e.g., moving to parents' house), are strongly affecting sleep habits under restrictions. Of note, our data were collected before the passage to the daylight\u2010saving time (March 29), which may further exacerbate sleep and mood problems in people living under social restrictions.",
