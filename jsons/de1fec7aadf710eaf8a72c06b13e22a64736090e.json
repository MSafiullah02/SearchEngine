This is expressed, for example, in the recent establishment of special research centers such as UCLA's Institute on Inequality and Democracy, LSE's International Inequality Institute, Stanford's Center on Poverty and Inequality, and the University of Amsterdam Centre for Inequality Studies. It is also apparent, of course, in the literature. The work by Thomas Piketty (2014), particularly, drew much attention and it was emblematic of a wider trend across the academy (e.g., Stiglitz, 2012) and in public debates and popular media (e.g., The Economist, 2019) .",

Variations across class, race, ethnicity, age, gender, or citizenship status are also often considered at the national level.",

In some respects, this tradition goes back as far as the urban ecology approach of the Chicago School. There appears, however, a significant disconnect with the more general social science literature and much of that is probably due to different scales of analysis and the attention (or lack thereof) to the role of space in the creation or maintenance of inequality.",

In part, this is simply a reflection of rapid and ongoing urbanization worldwide, where social questions are increasingly urban questions (Brenner & Schmid, 2014; Wang, He, Liu, Zhuang, & Hong, 2012) . It is also, we argue, related to the worldwide emergence of new modes of production in the last few decades (digital, information-based, consumer oriented) that signal an unprecedented urbanization of the world economy, what Scott (2017) refers to as the \"third wave\". Finally, we argue that this new, largely urban-based, economy is accompanied by new and deepening inequalities across multiple dimensions. Our argumentation is based on a broad overview of the literature, in part from a comparative perspective (Nijman, 2015a) , and with special attention to the other articles in this special journal issue. Our main point is that, if we want to understand overall inequality trends in the 21st century and the policies needed to confront them, it is imperative to consider their urban contexts.",

Proper understanding of current urban inequalities requires a fundamental understanding of such recent shifts in the nature of production and of the spatial ramifications of these shifts, particularly at the urban scale. As we argue below, the new economy has propelled urban inequalities in three ways: (1) greater bifurcation of the workforce and deepening income inequalities; (2) increasing inter-urban inequalities (growth vs. shrinkage); and (3) revival of central cities and urban centers that have become increasingly exclusionary, along with increased 'sorting' and inequalities between different suburban areas.",

There is no need here for a general review but it is worth noting that the manufacturing era generally witnessed urban growth and expansion of the (lower) middle classes. The later decline of manufacturing in North America and Europe since the 1960s was directly related to the ensuing urban crisis, one aspect of which involved the shrinking of the working middle classes. For the purpose of this paper, we are particularly interested in what happened since the 1980s and in more recent years.",

The recovery of urban growth since around 1990 was in essence based on the emergence of a new economy; a new mode of production that was, even more than during the industrial age, emphatically situated in urban areas. Instead of manufactured goods, the new economy revolves around information products and was propelled by the digital revolution. It involves mainly finance and professional and business services (accounting, insurance, advertising, consulting, marketing), cultural industries (Sassen, 2012; Scott, 2017) , and, in some urban areas, high-tech industries (e.g., Silicon Valley, The Texas Corridor, the NC Research Triangle, etc.).",

Half of them are in finance, three in insurance, and the other two in information technology and pharmacology.

For some of the cities that did not follow the example of New York, deindustrialization had lasting and deeply erosive effects; the transition to an urban information economy, high-tech production and especially consumption never quite arrived and the return to growth never happened. In 2017, one in ten U.S. cities had shrinking populations and the experience is not unique to the United States. For example, one-third of Germany's cities are losing population; the same is happening in varying degrees across Europe and, notably, also in Japan and South Korea.

While cities such as New York and others revived against the backdrop of this dynamic new economy, the benefits did not accrue equally across the urban population. In fact, the new economy has only deepened the inequality that crystallized during the period of deindustrialization and urban decline. Professional workers in the new economy tend to be highly educated, highly skilled, and highly paid. The service workers in that same economy, from retail personnel to clerical staff to hospitality workers, tend to be low-skilled and low-paid. Accordingly, the new urban economy is characterized by a bi-modal income distribution, a bifurcated workforce, and a polarized social structure (e. g., Sassen, 2012) . To keep with the example of New York: in 2016, the top 1% of income earners took 40% of all income while the bottom half had to make do with 6% (NYIBO, 2017). Nationally, in terms of wealth (of greater significance than income to the truly advantaged), in 2014 the top 0.1% of the U.S. population had more than doubled its wealth since 1980 and controlled as much as the bottom 90% (Saez & Zucman., 2014) .",

Those suburbs may at the same time witness an influx of foreign migrants or the very people who are being displaced from the center. Gentrification has been prominent feature of central city revival.

On the other hand, the divergence school argues that regional inequality tends to be maintained and even intensified; agglomeration and capital accumulation tend to reinforce spatial inequality and uneven development. Barro and Salaimartin (1992) emphasizes beta-convergence (i.e., poorer regions tend to grow faster than richer regions), and club convergence among regions with similar development conditions.

For example, renters in China may not have access to public schools and public housing because of the hukou system (Li, Wei, Yu, Tian, 2019) .

Many affordable housing programs have \"failed\" to some degree (Albright, Derickson, & Massey, 2013; Nguyen, Basolo, & Tiwari, 2013; Zou, 2014) . These programs tend to cover the people who are more vulnerable (Huang, 2012) . However, in the U.S., illegal immigrants are suffering more from housing affordability problems (McConnell, 2013) , but the lack of legal status may prevent them from getting housing assistance (McCarty & Siskin, 2004) . There are similar situations in China, as many policies are only available to registered residents (local urban hukou holders), and government policies provide registered residents better accessibility, or lower barriers to get the benefits than migrants (Huang, 2012) . Furthermore, these programs may not be welcomed by nearby communities because of \"not in my back yard\" (NIMBY) effects (Nguyen et al., 2013) . Combined with the fact that people relying on affordable housing usually have lower income and mobility, these people may get stuck in areas with less development, which can finally constrain their upward mobility (Verdugo, 2016).",

Other studies also find that racial residential segregation varies among different ethnic backgrounds. For example, Mexican immigrants in the U.S. generally fit the trend described by the spatial assimilation model (Brown, 2007) . Chinese immigrants, however, are more likely to fit the cultural preference model, although some of them are not pursuing residential assimilation, as Chinese immigrants still prefer to live among other Chinese (Yu & Myers, 2007) .",

Income segregation results in severe problems when local governments highly depend on taxes to provide social welfare, public goods, and infrastructure (Ross, Houle, Dunn, & Aye, 2004 ). The rich may \"self-segregate\" thanks to their enhanced residential mobility (Reardon & Bischoff, 2011; Watson, 2009) . Scholars have also begun to relate income segregation to other dimensions of urban inequality, such as spatial mismatch. For example, Haddad (2020) uncovers the positive and intensifying relationship between income segregation and commuting time, which significantly affects urban poor.

Two kinds of spatial mismatch are highlighted by researchers. The first one studies spatial variation and commuting behavior in the labor market and housing market, and the second one studies the impacts of spatial mismatch on people in terms of demographic and socioeconomic conditions (Horner, 2004; Kim, Sang, Chun, & Lee, 2012) . In Western countries, scholars are mainly attracted to racial or socioeconomic spatial mismatch (Mclafferty & Preston, 1992; Ross, 1998) . Although residential segregation is still one of the most important causes of spatial mismatch, it is not as pervasive as in the past. Nevertheless, the spatial mismatch level seems have not to have decreased in step with the decline of residential segregation, which suggests residential segregation is not the only cause of spatial mismatch.",

As population sprawls, people who cannot afford new suburban homes are remain in the old community. As employment sprawls, especially the service and manufacturing jobs which are suitable to poor and under-educated people, poor people who are trapped in urban centers and highly rely on public transportation facilities no longer have access to these jobs (Ding & Bingham, 2000; Glaeser & Kahn, 2001, p. 8117) . Job decentralization also affects people's commuting time. In monocentric cities, decentralization can partly solve the traffic problem because people in the suburbs may have better accessibility to their jobs locally (Giuliano & Small, 1993; Gordon, Kumar, & Richardson, 1989) . However, in a polycentric city, the complexity of urban spaces and unevenly distributed houses and job opportunities have significant negative effects on commuting time (Giuliano & Small, 1993) , although others disagree (Veneri, 2010) . Job opportunities and spatial mismatch in the context of polycentric development need further investigation.",

Scholars have revealed that vehicles and other small sources of air pollution may contribute more than large pollutive facilities to health problems in poor neighborhoods. Busy roads produce both air pollution and noise, and the inverse-distance based relationship between busy roads and negative impacts on health has been uncovered (Stewart et al., 2014) . Moreover, urban green space has been recognized as another important factor in environmental inequality and social justice (Whitehead, 2009; Wolch, Byrne, & Newell, 2014) . Green spaces attract people to do more physical activities, and reduce local pollution Wolch et al., 2014) . Poor people usually have less access to urban green spaces for two reasons. First, they are trapped in urban centers, which are crowded and there is not enough available area for urban green spaces. Second, the region they live in may lack resources, and local government may not be able to maintain urban green spaces.",

How these forces contribute to urban inequality and how to address arising urban problems remain challenging questions. More generally, theories of urban economic/income inequality in the context of rapid technological change are under-developed and are insufficient to examine emerging patterns of urban inequality (Huang & Wei, 2019) . In particular, more research is needed on the significance of the growing segment of self-employed workers and the emergence of the gig economy.

In China, especially, underlying mechanisms of housing markets and affordability remain poorly understood.

The notion of urban 'syndemics' (Singer, Bulled, Ostrach, & Mendenhall, 2017) can be used to indicate the spatial convergence of an array of conditions that define well-being and inequality: problems of, for example, unemployment, low incomes, poor health, low education, and lack of access to amenities, food, and urban services, often are concentrated in space but it is hard to identify the key drivers of such processes. Emergent approaches in data analytics and urban policy analytics rely on potentially rich data sources to study the multiple dimensions of urban inequality, and the development of data science and GIS can provide powerful tools to increase our understanding. In the meantime, any progress in our understanding of the nature of present-day inequalities requires close attention to their urban spatial dynamics, across the globe.",
