Hospital emergency departments (EDs), outpatient clinics, and even physician offices could be required to handle a surge of patients, many potentially infectious, others motivated by fear to seek medical care for their nonspecific \u201cflu-like\u201d or respiratory symptoms. In addition to providing patient care, health care facilities must also protect their patients, staff, and visitors from exposure to potentially infectious patients. Between April 15 and June 9, 2003, 74 SARS cases were reported to Toronto Public Health. Of these, 29 (39%) of 74 were among health care workers, 28 (38%) of 34 occurred as a result of exposure during hospitalization, and 17 (23%) of 74 occurred among hospital visitors.1 Under these scenarios, staffing shortages are probable, appropriate respiratory protection supplies will be in high demand, and the need to isolate potentially infectious patients will exceed the availability of airborne infection isolation rooms.",

Recent governmental reports indicate that the US health care system generally lacks the patient isolation capacity to handle a significant airborne infectious epidemic or bioterrorism event.2., 3. Attempts to identify alternative isolation approaches have had few details and much controversy.4., 5. Draft recommendations prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for community-level preparedness and response to SARS include a few references to the use of portable filtration units and other engineering controls to address surge-patient isolation requirements; however, more guidance is needed about their selection and effective use.6\n",

HEPA filters are at least 99.97% efficient in removing particles that are 0.3 \u03bcm (the size most difficult to capture) and essentially 100% efficient for particles either larger or smaller than 0.3 \u03bcm. The selection of portable filtration technology as an evaluated approach was fueled by its compatibility with existing ventilation systems, its affordability, and its recognition in published literature as an available engineering control to assist in patient isolation.7., 8., 9., 10. In particular, these references cite the use of portable filtration units as a way to increase the effective dilution of airborne contaminants within a designated airborne infection isolation room. By virtue of a \u201czone-within-zone\u201d approach to configuring patient isolation areas, the researchers sought to improve on the traditional whole-room dilution approach to contaminant control by significantly increasing source containment and capture efficiency within a smaller inner isolation zone occupied by the patient. In this manner, contaminant spread to the remainder of the room (the outer zone) could be minimized, thus reducing health care worker exposure potential.",

The room's floor space measured approximately 20\u00d716 ft (6\u00d75 m). The original room design accommodated 3 patient beds, with no provisions for airborne infection isolation. A restroom measuring approximately 5\u00d710 ft (1.5\u00d73.0 m) was connected to the patient room. The door to the restroom remained closed throughout the testing. For the patient isolation research, there were 2 evaluated configurations: a 2-patient configuration with independent isolation areas for each patient and a single-patient isolation configuration. Of the 7 trial scenarios evaluated during the study, 3 scenarios were variations of the 2-patient configuration, and 4 scenarios were variations of the single-patient configuration.",

In actual practice, the cotton privacy curtains could remain in place, and the plastic curtains could be mounted inside of the cotton. The plastic curtains were constructed from 4-mil plastic sheeting sold as painting drop cloth in home improvement and painting supply stores. The plastic curtains were mounted to within approximately 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) of the ceiling curtain track using the existing curtain hooks, thus retaining the curtain's ability to be completely opened and closed.

The inlet perimeter of the HEPA unit was tightly secured to the 2 curtains using plastic sheeting and strips of sheathing tape. In this configuration, the HEPA unit pulled \u201ccontaminated\u201d air from the 2 patient isolation areas (inner zones) and discharged clean air into the remainder of the room (the common outer zone). After initial tests revealed a transfer of source aerosol between the 2 patient isolation zones, additional 4-mil plastic sheeting was used to construct a floor-to-ceiling vertical partition at the inlet-side of the HEPA unit to prevent such migration. A photograph of the inlet side of the HEPA unit showing the vertical partition, as well as the plastic curtains taped into place, is shown in\nFigure 3. To facilitate controlled airflow into the inner isolation zones, each curtain was retracted to create a gap approximately 10 inches (0.25 m) wide near the head of the respective patient beds where the patient care provider might frequently stand. The gap width selection was based on qualitative smoke tests using a handheld smoke generator (Cumulus Air Flow Indicator, Draeger Safety Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). This gap provided a strategic path of least resistance for air to enter the inner isolation zone and flow past the health care worker, over the patient, and toward the HEPA unit with minimal recirculation inside the enclosure.",

This particle size was chosen as being representative of the 1- to 3-\u03bcm size range of tuberculosis bacteria, spores (including anthrax spores), and other infectious bioaerosols that remain airborne for long periods, are readily inhaled, and penetrate deep into the lung.11 The airborne particles were sized and counted at 3 locations inside of the source patient's (patient 1) isolation zone and 3 locations outside of this zone using real-time light-scattering aerosol spectrometers (Grimm Dust Monitors, Models 1.105, 1.106, and 1.108 [2 each], Labortechnik GmbH & CoKG, Ainring, Germany). These monitors measure the aerosol size distribution in 8 size ranges. Results were logged in the form of particle counts per liter of air at a 1-minute sampling interval. For the purposes of this research, attention was paid to the size range between 1 \u03bcm and 2 \u03bcm, which corresponds to the 1.65-\u03bcm source aerosol. The aerosol monitors were located as shown in Figure 2, Figure 4 and placed at bed height (approximately 36 inches [91 cm] above the floor) except the provider position monitor inside the enclosure, which was placed at a height (60 inches [150 cm] above the floor) representing the breathing zone of a standing health care provider.

After the initial trial run in the 2-patient configuration revealed low-level source migration into the outer zone, qualitative smoke tests revealed that a stream of contaminated air, induced by the discharge side of the HEPA unit, was escaping under the HEPA unit in the gap created by the wheels. A simple addition of tape and plastic eliminated this path, and no further migration of source aerosol was measured or observed. Smoke tests, such as the one shown in\nFigure 5, were also helpful in conducting qualitative evaluations to visualize a configuration's ability to quickly capture and remove airborne contaminants.",

The disparity in particle counts observed at patient bed 1, the provider position, and the remaining measurement locations produces poor resolution at the lower particle counts.\nFigure 7 is a reduced-scale version of the same graph to allow better resolution of the particle counts measured outside patient 1's inner isolation zone. In evaluation of the ability of a tested scenario to contain the source aerosol within the inner isolation zone, the particle counts logged by the outer zone aerosol monitors were examined for concentration increases within the 1- to 2-\u03bcm band corresponding to the released source aerosol. If all of the outer zone monitors reported steady or decreasing concentrations, the inner zone was considered to have contained the generated source aerosol. In the 2-bed configuration trials, the potential migration of source aerosol between patient zones was evaluated by observing concentration trends within the patient 2 isolation zone. Preventing such contaminant crossover could be extremely important if the 2 patients have only a suspect diagnosis, such as with patients recently admitted into a hospital ED. Last, the metric used to determine the relative ability of a tested scenario to reduce the risk of airborne exposure to the health care worker was the mean particle count (within 1- to 2-\u03bcm range) observed at the health care worker position divided by that observed near the source patient (monitoring position at center of bed). This value is identified as the \u201cworker/patient exposure ratio.\u201d Although the metric is useful in evaluating the different scenarios and in making comparisons between them, there is insufficient evidence to extrapolate this metric to a quantitative exposure reduction in an actual environment.",

The first trial scenario, a 2-patient configuration with the curtain entrance gap closed, was the worst performing trial among both configurations. However, the knowledge gained by this test run aided the success of subsequent trials. After establishing the desired curtain gap and sealing the gap discovered under the HEPA unit, the aerosol count data for trials 2 through 7 revealed continuous reductions in aerosol counts for those monitors located outside the inner zone, despite the activation of the nebulizer and source generation. Counts outside the enclosures were indistinguishable from background levels present at the beginning of the experiments, indicating that the source aerosol was being successfully contained, captured, and filtered within the inner isolation zone. After trials 1 and 2 revealed slight increases in aerosol concentration within the patient 2 isolation zone, the vertical partition was added to the inlet-side of the HEPA unit, thus isolating the 2 inner isolation zones and eliminating this potential path of contaminant crossover.",

The most protective trial among all tested configurations was the 2-patient configuration evaluated during trial 3. Trials 4 and 6 among the single-patient configurations also look promising. There were increased variability and diminished protective effect in trials 5 and 7 when the supply air diffusers were opened within the inner isolation zone, which is believed to be caused by the competing air currents increasing turbulent mixing within the inner isolation zone and disrupting the flow path into the HEPA unit. In practice, supply diffusers within the inner isolation zones should probably remain closed, thus relying on tempered transfer air from the outer zone to meet thermal comfort requirements.",

The key characteristic of the observed reductions is the controlled movement of the particles away from the patient and provider and toward the HEPA unit. This controlled movement allows providers to minimize their exposure by positioning themselves away from the airflow path. Standard isolation rooms do not share this feature because room air is mixed to dilute contaminants rather than being directed in a single flow direction for removal. Furthermore, contaminant removal by directed airflow is virtually immediate, whereas removal by dilution takes place during a period determined by the room volume and ventilation rate.",

As such, it has several limitations that should be considered in interpreting the results. First, the study was limited to a discrete set of enclosure designs evaluated in a single facility, whereas actual work environments will undoubtedly require variations to accommodate specific patient care situations and health care facility engineering characteristics. Additional work is needed to refine design options that integrate the enclosure systems with the facility HVAC systems to ensure pathogen control while maintaining patient comfort, without interfering with HVAC operation in other areas of the facility. Second, the measurements were performed without an actual patient in place and undergoing normal care so that the influence of factors such as patient movement, positioning, breathing, and coughing, as well as care provider movements on system effectiveness, remains to be evaluated. Finally, actual pathogenic bioaerosols were not used in the work; however, this should not be considered a limitation because the determining factor in particle movement and filtration efficiency is particle aerodynamic size. Because the viability and pathogenicity of biologic aerosols are negatively affected by environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and oxygen toxicity,13., 14. use of inanimate surrogates actually represents a conservative evaluation of system effectiveness.",
