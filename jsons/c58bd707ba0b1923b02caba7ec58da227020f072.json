            "text": "Fungal viruses or mycoviruses are widespread in fungi and are believed to be of ancient origin. They have evolved in concert with their hosts and are usually associated with symptomless infections. Mycoviruses are transmitted intracellularly during cell division, sporogenesis and cell fusion, and they lack an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Their natural host ranges are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups. Typically, fungal viruses are isometric particles 25\u00b150 nm in diameter, and possess dsRNA genomes. The best characterized of these belong to the family Totiviridae whose members have simple undivided dsRNA genomes comprised of a coat protein (CP) gene and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) gene. A recently characterized totivirus infecting a \u00aelamentous fungus was found to be more closely related to protozoan totiviruses than to yeast totiviruses suggesting these viruses existed prior to the divergence of fungi and protozoa. Although the dsRNA viruses at large are polyphyletic, based on RDRP sequence comparisons, the totiviruses are monophyletic. The theory of a cellular self-replicating mRNA as the origin of totiviruses is attractive because of their apparent ancient origin, the close relationships among their RDRPs, genome simplicity and the ability to use host proteins ef\u00aeciently. Mycoviruses with bipartite genomes ( partitiviruses), like the totiviruses, have simple genomes, but the CP and RDRP genes are on separate dsRNA segments. Because of RDRP sequence similarity, the partitiviruses are probably derived from a totivirus ancestor. The mycoviruses with unencapsidated dsRNA-like genomes (hypoviruses) and those with bacilliform ( ) strand RNA genomes (barnaviruses) have more complex genomes and appear to have common ancestry with plant ( ) strand RNA viruses in supergroup 1 with potyvirus and sobemovirus lineages, respectively. The La France isometric virus (LIV), an unclassi\u00aeed virus with multipartite dsRNA genome, is associated with a severe die-back disease of the cultivated mushroom. LIV appears to be of recent origin since it differs from its host in codon usage.",

In general, mycoviruses are associated with latent infections of their hosts and are not known to have natural vectors. They are transmitted in nature intracellularly by hyphal anastomosis and heterokaryosis (lateral transmission), and are disseminated via spores (serial transmission). Because fungi have a potential for plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange during extended periods of their life cycles, and because they produce many types of propagules (sexual and asexual spores), often in great profusion, mycoviruses have accessible to them highly ef\u00aecient means for transmission and spread (1, 2) .",

Because of lack of infectivity as free particles, mycoviruses have been described as noninfectious, endogenous, or heritable viruses (3, 4) . The use of this terminology without ample explanation, however, may be misleading and inaccurate. Whereas the term noninfectious may be useful in differentiating between viruses that lack extracellular routes of infection and those that are infectious as free virions, it inaccurately implies structural de\u00aeciencies of the viruses (see section on mycovirus infectivity). The terms endogenous and heritable viruses imply that mycoviruses have the ability to integrate a DNA copy into host DNA. Although there is preliminary supportive evidence (S.M. Tavantzis, personal communication), this mode of mycovirus existence is not well documented for any group of fungal viruses. If true, this would be of considerable interest because it would mean that fungal viruses have evolved an ultimate intracellular existence.",

As a result of these intracellular modes of transmission, the natural host ranges of mycoviruses are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups (20) . Mycoviruses may be eliminated during sexual spore formation. Even though the yeast ssRNA and dsRNA viruses are effectively transmitted via ascospores, the mycoviruses infecting the ascomycetous \u00aelamentous fungi are essentially eliminated during ascospore formation (1) . On the other hand, ssRNA and dsRNA mushroom viruses are transmitted ef\u00aeciently via basidiospores (21) . Mixed infections with two or more unrelated viruses are common, probably also as a consequence of the ways by which fungal viruses are transmitted in nature. There are apparently no structural interactions between these viruses since heterologous encapsidation has not been reported in mixed infections (1, 2) . Accumulation of defective dsRNA and/or satellite dsRNA is a common feature of mycovirus infections, and the resulting complexity of dsRNA banding pattern has, in some instances, led to confusion in interpreting the nature and organization of the virus genomes. In these cases, molecular characterization of the virus in question is required to verify whether the essential genome is segmented, nonsegmented plus defective/satellite dsRNAs or whether the complexity is the result of mixed infections with more than one virus.",

Virusinduced diseases and virus-mediated attenuation of virulence in plant pathogenic fungi provide excellent opportunities for fundamental studies aimed at developing novel biological control measures. The hypovirulence phenotype in the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) is an excellent and well documented example for a mycoviral-induced phenotype that is currently being exploited for biological control (22, 24) .

Giardia lanblia is a primitive eukaryote with two nuclei, but no mitochondria, Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum. G. lanblia, but not other protozoan hosts of relatively more recent origin, must have natural cell surface proteins that may serve as virus receptors and allow the entire virion to enter the cell. For a dsRNA virus like GLV, entry of the entire virion is crucial since the virion-associated RNAdependent RNA-polymerase (RDRP) must accompany the dsRNA template to initiate infection.

If the SKI genes are defective, the L-A virus with associated satellite M dsRNA system becomes pathogenic, as cells become cold sensitive for growth (31). About 30 chromosomal genes, termed MAK genes (for maintenance of killer), are required for stable replication of the satellite M dsRNA (31). Only three of these MAK genes are necessary for the helper virus (ScV-L-A) multiplication. Mutants defective in any of 20 MAK genes show a decreased level of free 60S ribosomal subunits. Since the mak mutations affecting 60S subunit levels are known to be suppressed by ski mutations and since the latter are now known to act by blocking translation of nonpolyadenylated mRNAs, the level of 60S ribosomal subunits is believed to be also critical for translation of nonpolyadenylated mRNAs (31). The Hv190S totivirus that infects the plant pathogenic fungus Helminthosporium victoriae, utilizes host-encoded proteins (a protein kinase and a protease) for posttranslational modi\u00aecation of its CP. Phosphorylation and proteolytic processing of CP may play a role in regulating transcription and the release of ( ) strand transcripts from virions (8, 32) . Hypoviruses (members of the family Hypoviridae) that infect the chestnut blight fungus have little or no effect on fungal growth but attenuate virulence by altering the G protein-linked cellular signal transduction processes (33) . Hypovirus-infected fungal strains (hypovirulent strains) are able to colonize wound sites and form super\u00aecial cankers on infected chestnut trees. One may argue that hypovirulence in this system represents a compromise that is bene\u00aecial for the survival of both the virus and fungal host. Unlike the virulent strains, hypovirulent strains do not kill the host trees, and furthermore, can convert virulent strains to hypovirulence.",

They are differentiated based on host, number of genome segments and capsid structure (single or double shelled). Members of the family Reoviridae (10\u00b112 segments packaged in double shelled virions) infect vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. The Pseudomonas phage f6 (family Cystoviridae) is the only known dsRNA virus that infects bacteria; its genome is comprised of three segments that are packaged in enveloped virions. Members of the families Birnaviridae (hosts; vertebrates and invertebrates) and Partitiviridae (hosts: fungi and plants) have bipartite genome segments that are packaged together (birnaviruses) or separately ( partitiviruses) in single shelled virions. The dsRNA viruses with undivided genomes (the family Totiviridae) package their monopartite genomes in single-shelled virions (hosts: fungi and parasitic protozoa). The sixth report of the ICTV lists a sixth family of dsRNA viruses, the family Hypoviridae (host: fungi), whose members lack conventional virions and their dsRNA molecules are enclosed in host-encoded vesicles. Whether the genomes of hypoviruses are dsRNA or ssRNA is still a matter of debate (see section on hypoviruses below).",

Even though the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPs) are the most highly conserved genes among RNA viruses, phylogenetic analysis of the RDRPs did not suggest a monophyletic origin for dsRNA viruses. The dsRNA viral RDRPs tend to group with different subdivisions (supergroups) of the ( ) strand RNA viruses (35) . Koonin (35) concluded from such phylogenetic studies that dsRNA viruses could have originated at multiple events in evolution from different supergroups of ( ) strand RNA viruses. Clustering of ( ) strand RNA viruses in three supergroups, however, received little support in a recent phylogenetic study to reevaluate the higher taxonomy of RNA viruses based on RNA polymerase (36) . These authors concluded that it is more appropriate to present the evolutionary relationships between RNA viruses as a set of distinct subtrees, the links between which are unclear, rather than a single and resolved phylogenetic tree. Because of the lack of conservation in primary sequence and size among polymerases, it was suggested that the requirements for polymerase function can be ful\u00aelled by diverse means supporting the notion of polyphyletic origins. Convergent evolution could then explain the presence of many of the conserved motifs among RDRPs.",

The UAA termination sequence at the end of ORF A is part of the pentanucleotide UAAUG in all hypoviruses investigated to date, with the AUG of the UAAUG pentanucleotide initiating the other long ORF, ORF B. The N-terminal product of ORF B is a papain-like cysteine protease that autocatalytically releases from the growing polypeptide chain. No further processing in vitro has been demonstrated for the remaining 300 kDa polypeptide from this ORF (18) . Sequence analysis of the putative polypeptide products encoded by ORF A and B of CHV-713 L-dsRNA revealed \u00aeve distinct domains with signi\u00aecant similarity to known conserved domains within plant potyvirus-encoded polyproteins (39) .

Considering the relative organization of the conserved domains within the CHV1-713encoded and potyvirus-encoded polyproteins, Koonin et al. (39) proposed that CHV1-713 dsRNA might have evolved by rearrangement of a positive strand RNA potyvirus-like genome. The following major events were perceived to have taken place: a) transposition of the helicase gene; b) duplication of the sequence encoding the protease domain of the HC; c) deletion of the sequence encoding the protease domain of the NIa; d) deletion of the capsid protein gene; and e) emergence of the termination codon separating the two ORFs. Because of their intracellular mode of transmission, fungal viruses can dispense with an extracellular route of infection and the required packaging function. In the absence of a capsid protein, the ratio of the ssRNA genome to the replicative form could have been altered so that the dsRNA form predominated. Because gene module shuf\u00afing has been recognized as a major trend in the evolution of positive strand viruses, Koonin et al. (39) propose that a similar process may account for the evolution of a dsRNA virus-like genetic element from a ( ) strand RNA virus (see Fig. 2 , pathway 7 for possible origin of hypoviruses from supergroup 1 ( ) strand RNA viruses).",

Like the totiviruses, the partitiviruses have simple genomes comprised of two genes (CP and RDRP) but, unlike the totiviruses, each gene is carried on a separate dsRNA segment (bipartite genomes). Whereas many of the totiviruses express their RDRP as a CP-RDRP fusion protein by fusing the CP and RDRP ORFs, the partitiviruses express their CP and RDRP as separate proteins from their divided genomes. The totiviruses (e.g. Hv190SV) that express their RDRP as a separate nonfused protein, possibly via an internal initiation mechanism (8), may be intermediates in the evolution of partitiviruses from ancestral totiviruses.",

            "text": "The LIV (or AbV1), an unclassi\u00aeed virus, is associated with a severe die-back disease (named La France disease) of cultivated mushroom. The virions isolated from diseased fruit bodies and mycelium are isometric 34\u00b136 nm in diameter and co-purify with 9 dsRNAs (referred to as disease-associated dsRNAs). The size of dsRNA segments varies from 3.6 kbp to 0.78 kbp, three of which are believed to be satellites (2, 49) . Although present evidence strongly suggests that the 9 disease-speci\u00aec dsRNAs are encapsidated in 34\u00b136 nm isometric virus particles (50), it is not clear whether the dsRNAs are encapsidated individually, in various combinations, or all nine segments are packaged in single particles. Examination of the cesium sulphate gradient pro\u00aele and results of dsRNA and protein analyses of the gradient fractions reveals that at least two broad density components were resolved, a lighter component of empty capsids and a nucleoprotein component (50) . Judging from the size of the particles (34\u00b136 nm in diameter), it is highly unlikely that all dsRNAs are packaged together in single particles. More likely, LIV represents a multiparticle system in which the various particle classes have similar densities. Packaging of the dsRNA segments probably occurs by a headful-type mechanism, in which either various combinations of different dsRNA segments, or single/multiple copies of the individual dsRNAs, dependent on size of segment, are packaged together. The various particle classes are thus predicted to have similar densities, and this is consistent with the results of cesium sulphate density gradient analysis of the puri\u00aeed virions (50) .",

The LIV RDRP is most closely related to those of totiviruses and partitiviruses. However, unlike the totiviruses and partitiviruses, LIV is believed to be of recent origin since its codon usage differs from that of its host Agaricus bisporus (19) . Because of its genome nature (segmented dsRNA genome) and RDRP sequence similarity, it may be possible that LIV arose from a partitivirus by acquiring additional genes (via reassortment/recombination) that are essential for its spread in the mushroom\u00afeshy tissue and for pathogenicity (see pathway 6, Fig. 3 ).",
