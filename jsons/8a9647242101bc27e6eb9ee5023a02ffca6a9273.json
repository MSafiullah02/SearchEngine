Notwithstanding, various scholars, apart from the definition given by the WHO, have defined the concept. Although it is not the first definition of health, the WHO's definition will still be the starting point because it is relatively old and has been central to the debate on the meaning of health. WHO (1948) defined health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease and infirmity. The definition is holistic, and it presents three major interrelated components of health (see Fig. 2 .1).",

Most often, disease represents a malfunction of a part of the body system or an intrusion of harmful organisms such as a virus or parasite. This may cause a breakdown of the individual affected. This physiological aspect is the most important biomedical criterion in the determination of health. For someone to be healthy, his/her biological components must be in order. A major diagnosis procedure involves a determination of what could be wrong with any component of the body or detection of any intrusion of any anti-body by tracing the pathways of the disease from underlying causes to pathology in the human body system and examination of any emerging of symptoms. Determining this may involve a series of laboratory tests or clinical examinations. One may be certified as healthy if there is no detection of any biological hitch. 2. The social: this represents the behavioural aspect of human health. Being a member of society is being in the network of social interaction and being able to fulfil social roles and expectations. If an individual is not active in the social network, it represents a form of social pathology-an abnormality, which is an infraction on the norms and values of society. The social also incorporates the spiritual dimension. The spiritual aspect could be personal to the individual by connecting to the world of reality and divinity. Larson (1999) observed that since the WHO's definition of health, medicine has treated individuals as social beings whose health is affected by social behaviour and interaction. 3. The mental: this indicates the psychological, emotional, and mental status of the individual. Emotional apathy, fixation, and maladjusted personality constitute a part of the manifestation of illness. Huber et al. (2011) observed that the mental aspect of health signifies the possession of a \"sense of coherence,\" which includes the subjective faculties enhancing the comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness of any circumstances.",

            "text": "The WHO's definition has been heavily criticised since it was conceived in 1946 after the Second World War (see Callahan 1973; Bice 1976; Pannenborg 1979; Wood 1986; Simmons 1989; Saracci 1997; Jadad and O'Grady 2008; Huber et al. 2011; Godlee 2011; Awofeso 2012) . For instance, Awofeso (2012) observed that the definition is inflexible and unrealistic. He claimed that the inclusion of the word \"complete\" in the definition makes it unlikely for anyone to be healthy for a reasonable period of time. Godlee (2011) also noted that the definition is absolute and therefore unachievable for most people in the world. The definition presents an absolute ideal situation by combining the three aspects of human life. It is often difficult, if not impossible, to gain complete contentment in all the aspects. It is observed that since health is a goal, not only of the health care system but also individual and the society at large, it is ideal for a body like WHO to present a realistic definition that can be operationalised and achievable (Godlee 2011 ). In addition, Saracci (1997) also submitted that the WHO's definition of health is problematic and it should be reconsidered. Saracci observed that the definition equates health with happiness-that a disruption of happiness could be regarded as a health problem. He further argued that the WHO's definition reflects that health is boundless. More so, Huber et al. (2011, p. 2) opined that the WHO's definition is problematic because it impliedly declares people with chronic diseases and disabilities definitively ill. The definition further minimises \"the role of the human capacity to cope autonomously with life's ever changing physical, emotional, and social challenges and to function with fulfilment and a feeling of wellbeing with a chronic disease or disability\" (Huber et al. 2011, p. 2) . Despite several decades of criticisms, the WHO has not reviewed the definition. The idea of a definition is to present a holistic view that is meaningful not only for individuals but also as a (definitive) tool in scientific investigation. The idea is not to advance an operational perfection that is unchangeable. Perhaps, there is yet a review because there has not been a more holistic and measurable alternative definition of health. The question is simple: are other definitions of \"health\" more operational?",

Some of these definitions will be critically examined; however, the essence of examining other definitions is not to defend the WHO's definition or to render such alternative definitions as immaterial. After some strictures of WHO's definition of health by Saracci (1997 Saracci ( , p. 1410 , he proposed a definition of health as \"a condition of wellbeing, free of disease or infirmity, and a basic and universal human right.\" Impliedly, this definition also defined those who are living positively with chronic disease as unhealthy. It presents a health as a basic right, which is also problematic. In most parts of the world, health is a commodity with an insurance premium, a price-tag, or it requires a pool from the public tax. This also seems like a theoretical proposition that is not operational. It does not really account for the multidimensionality of health. Therefore, it may not be considered a holistic and viable alternative to the WHO definition. Health promotion and progress toward higher functioning, energy, comfort, and integration of mind, body, and spirit Environmental model Adaptation to physical and social surroundings-a balance free from undue pain, discomfort, or disability Bircher (2005, p. 1), on the other hand, defines health as \"a dynamic state of wellbeing characterised by a physical and mental potential, which satisfies the demands of life commensurate with age, culture, and personal responsibility.\" While this is stylishly holistic, it is contentious due to the use of other concepts (e.g., age and culture) without unified definitions. For instance, culture is complex, dynamic, and relative. This may imply that the definition of health will also be relative and probably depend on the circumstances or societies. Additionally, does the definition refer to biological age or social construction of age? This is part of the complicatedness as the concepts used are not specific.",

A combination of these models will be more holistic beyond the use of only the WHO model or other definitions. Table 2 .1 presents the models of defining health. One major problem with model-based definition is that there could be more models than expected. The model-approach does not present a whole definition. Later, every profession will likely present a model of health beyond common understanding, and this will generate more issues.

Health in this sociological sense is more inclined towards human capacity to fulfil their obligations, participate in social activities (including work), and fulfil role expectations in the society in the face of structural limitations. This conception is connected with both physiological and mental models of health in the sense that the source of a social incapacitation could be from a biological or mental limitation.

The definition seems to be receiving some considerations, especially because of the use of \"adaptation.\" While the WHO's definition stresses on a complete state, this definition proposes adaptive capacity. Lancet Editorial (2009, p. 781) commented, \"Health is an elusive as well as a motivating idea. By replacing perfection with adaptation, we get closer to a more compassionate, comforting, and creative programme for medicine-one to which we can all contribute.\" The major strength of this definition is that it takes account of the shift in health challenges in the twenty-first century. Unlike the period before World War II when acute diseases were more prevalent than chronic diseases, now the latter constitutes a greater burden. Chronic diseases require behavioural adjustments in terms of self-care or management (see Sects. 2.6.2 and 8.3). This is why the idea of adaptation seems to be more current than that of \"a complete state.\"",

One of the major dimensions of health identified by Blaxter (1990 Blaxter ( , 2010 is the lay concept of health. This implies how different individuals define health, which explains the relativity of the concept. The lay concept of health is essentially subjective because it is based on people's own assessment and judgment of whether they are healthy or not. Blaxter (1990, p. 40) observed that the most \"usual way of measuring self-perceived illness, as distinct from the presence or absence of disease, is by means of symptom lists.\" To the lay population, absence of symptoms means health. From this perspective, Blaxter (1990) identified the three \"states\" of health: freedom from illness, ability to function, and fitness. In this regards, health is also perceived as energy and vitality in terms of fitness for functions: physical, social and normative activities. Blaxter (2010) argued that health could be defined, constructed, experienced, acted out, and it is also dynamic. Definitions of health are often for operational use like the previous definitions that have been considered. Construction of health stems from the lay perspective or individual's appraisal of state of health, which can be good or bad. Such construction also includes what a particular society qualifies as \"health.\" For instance, labelling reactivity (people's reaction to a particular condition) might influence designation or conceptualisation of health or illness in a particular society (see sect. 8.4.1 for labeling theory). Experiential knowledge of health is phenomenological-derived from feeling of wellness or otherwise, which emanate from the presence or absence of personal discomfort and pain. In terms of \"enactment\" of health, the central consideration includes what people do to maintain their health. Health is also a dynamic attribute because it fluctuates across biographical, historical and contextual milieus. The state of health varies across lifespan, and is influenced by a number of factors including personal (e.g., lifestyle) and structural factors (e.g., access to health care) (see Chapter four). The conceptualisation of disease will be the focus of next section.",

            "text": "Health has been conceived in a biomedical model as the absence of disease while the holistic definition from the WHO signifies that health is not a mere absence of disease. Whichever form the definition takes, the question now is \"what constitutes a disease?\" One major issue is that disease is often conceived from a biomedical point of view. It can also have behavioural manifestations, especially with regard to human functionality. The definition of health is complex, so also is the definition of a disease. If the lack of health can be defined as not a mere absence of a disease or infirmity, this signifies that there are a number of germ-and non-germ-related (medical) conditions that can signify the presence of a disease. This, however, also makes the definition of a disease complex because of variations in its conceptions. Mainly, Boorse (1975 Boorse ( , 1977 was engrossed in a practical and philosophical discussion of what health and disease may entail. He defined disease as a type of internal state which impairs health (i.e., reduces one or more functional ability below typical efficiency). One major criticism of this definition is the use of \"typical efficiency,\" which implies the presence of a reference group in the definition of disease (Kingma 2007; Stempsey 2000) as a kind of comparative analysis. This view is often referred to as a biostatistical theory (BST) of health and disease. Kingma (2007) argued that human species are different in functional capacity: what is normal in one group can be abnormal in another and vice versa. Therefore, Boorse's definition of health or disease is only valid depending on the reference group.",

There is also a measure of statistical normality of clinical variables such as blood pressure, basal metabolism, weight, sugar level, height, pulse, and respiration. Any measure beyond the normal range is usually termed as an abnormality or a disease condition and signifies the need for medical attention. When normal blood pressure ends, there begins hypotension or hypertension. This average of normality is derived from the rate of mortality or functionality within normal and abnormal ranges. It is assumed that mortality or dysfunctionality is often higher when below or above normal ranges. This may not always be the case as clinical variables are measures of probability or propensity to a disease. 4. Disability: disease could also lead to many forms of disability. Poliomyelitis is a typical example of a disease that can cause physical deformity. In another case, a disease may reduce active participation of an individual in the social network, such as the inability to walk or stand. Pregnancy, for instance, could not count as a disease even though it comes with some limitations. A number of skin diseases may not count as disease since they may not present with disabling effects. 5. Adaptation: the ability to adapt to the environment has also been categorised as a form of healthiness while those who are not fit are presumably diseased. Lack of adaptation prevents an individual from meeting the average level of a species' functionality. The presence of eumelanin pigmentation in the skins of black Africans helps in adapting to their environment, but it does not mean those with pheomelanin pigmentation cannot survive in Africa or that Africans cannot survive elsewhere. Environmental can even inflict suffering on humans in the process of adaptations. 6. Homeostasis: health is a state of bodily equilibrium while disease is a state of homeostatic failure. But the process of human growth as Boorse observed is itself leading to homeostatic disequilibrium. 7. Value: disease is undesirable while health is desirable. Health is thus a social value in human society. However, it is also impossible to exclusively delineate disease from the point of undesirability. Conditions such as shortness and ugliness cannot be counted as diseases even though they may not be desirable.",

Disease often requires medical intervention. As noted earlier, not all that conditions which require medical intervention constitute disease. A disease is a pathological state which can be diagnosed through a competent medical analysis. Disease, however, does not always mean there must be a pathological agent such as a virus or bacterium. Conditions such as infertility, gunshot wound, fracture, drowning, and other forms of injuries/accidents also qualify as disease because they represent an infraction on normal human condition. More so, Fabrega (1973) explained that diseases usually present with a biological discontinuity. Biological discontinuity signifies the presence of pathology in any part of the body or bodily inactivity due to an injury. Some diseases have pathological , some are mere deformities or birth defects (e.g., brain injury, autism, spinal bifida), while some are the actual breakdown of organs (e.g., renal failure, blindness) or organ functional problems (e.g., impotency, ectopic pregnancy). All these diseases have to do with biological problems and constitute apparent forms of diseases.",

In the pre-industrial era, obesity was a sign of affluence and good living, while in the modern era it is a disease with enormous research and development of medical interventions (including surgical procedures) to \"cure\" obesity. Apart from the medical risks of obesity, the social and modern reconstruction of beauty as a slim body figure also affects attitudes towards obesity.

This is why Nordenfeldt (1993) observed that to be ill is to be in pain, to be anxious, or to be disabled. The notion of illness fits appropriately into the concept of sick role described by Parsons (1951) . It is a situation when an individual consciously feels that he/she is unhealthy, sometimes as a result of discomfort and pain. Therefore, illness is the live-experience of a diseased condition.

The goal was set following a realisation that chronic diseases are the major cause of death in almost all countries, accounting for up to 60 % of all causes of deaths: 4.9 million people die as a result of tobacco use; 2.6 million people die as a result of being overweight or obese; 4.4 million people die as a result of raised total cholesterol levels; 7.1 million people die as a result of raised blood pressure (WHO 2005) . A chronic disease/illness often presents as a medical condition, which makes an individual perceptually and perpetually ill. Major chronic diseases include heart disease and stroke (cardiovascular diseases), cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic respiratory diseases), diabetes, obesity, ulcers, sickle cell diseases, and hypertension.

Protracted course: Even when a chronic disease is symptomatic, the sufferer may live with it for several years, especially with proper medical management. For this reason, chronic diseases impoverish millions of (already poor) households because such diseases often gulp a lot of expenditures: its management is usually protracted and expensive. 3.

Mental problems frequently manifest with behavioural changes that represent an infraction on the social norms of the society. A mental disorder is socially disastrous to the individual and could lead to total incapacitation or exemption from normal roles in the society. There are two major divisions of mental illness, which include neurosis (minor) and psychosis (major). While the former does not usually involve organic (brain) breakdown, the latter usually does. Examples of neurosis include: obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobia, dissociative disorder, minor depression, hypochondria, hysteria, and puerperal neurosis. Psychosis involves loss of contact with reality. It is generally the worst form of mental disorder. Examples of psychosis include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, substance-induced mental disorder, dementia (Alzheimer), delusional disorder, and epilepsy. A mental disorder may not necessarily lead to death, but it is disabling-it could be acute or chronic. Sartorius (2007) observed that stigma attached to mental illness is the main obstacle to the provision of care for people living with mental disorders. The stigma is a mark or label on those who are ill and their generations (see Sect. 8.4 .2 for the theory of stigma).",

It is often the case for scientists to consider some local beliefs about causality implausible, inexplicit, and inconsiderable in scientific explanations.

As Conco (1967) and Omonzejele (2008) explained, this is the spiritual construction invoked to explain the \"uncommon or out-of-the-ordinary\" types of sickness. It is further observed that it is made use of at a point where ordinary empirical methods of treatment and explanation have failed. This typically deals with divine attribution of illness. With the emergence of modern religions, such as Christianity and Islam, there is attribution of diseases to God. Such diseases may come as punishment for misdoings or sins. References to divine infliction of diseases/plagues can be cited from both the Bible and Quran in historical times. Especially among most religious adherents, there is a fatalistic belief that disease or health comes from God. Such infliction will usually present with medically unexplained symptoms or with medically explained symptoms that are beyond medical remedies. This is a part of the belief system and such diseases require pleasing the God through repentance, fasting, and prayers. Disease could also come from the gods, spirits, deities, and other supernatural entities such as wizards and witches. This traditional perspective of illness describes a different source of evil (illness) caused by invisible spirits that exist within and outside human social boundaries (Foster 1976 ). These spirits inhabit trees, rivers, lakes, mountains, and deserted places around the habitation (Bhasin 2007, p. 6) . In most African societies, there are gods or deities of the land who need to be appeased from time to time, both at the individual and community levels. Lack of appeasement from either of the levels could be detrimental. The people of the Kalahari Desert also attribute diseases and health to Hishe (god). So also the Bantu of South Africa (like many other groups in Africa) believes that supernatural entities can inflict pain or disease on individuals. Conco (1967, p. 288 ) specifically explained that [i] n varying degrees most rural Africans believe that it [supernatural causation] explains all complexes of extra-ordinary diseases. They also believe that it is true, and this implies that they are psychologically convinced, though they cannot give conclusive empirical grounds for its truth. It is a metaphysical article of faith, and as such it cannot be verified or falsified empirically, though it always has some claim to being factual.",

Foster (1976) and Garro (2000) noted that, among several people, there is a wide belief in the supernatural cause of illness: the Mono of Liberia and Abron of Cote d'ivoire believe that death is usually caused by external forces. Jegede (2002 Jegede ( , 2005 observed that among the Yoruba of western Nigeria, illness can be traced to enemies (ota), witchcraft (aje), sorcery or wizard (oso), gods (orisa), and ancestors (ebora). The belief of the supernatural causes of illness is still highly prevalent and central in the explanation of illness in Africa (Omonzejele 2008) .",

The Yoruba call hereditary disease aisan idile, literarily translated as \"a family disease.\" Treatment depends on the perception of the aetiology, whether natural or supernatural. Some biomedical hereditary/genetic diseases include autism, cancer, dwarfism, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, albinism, color blindness, myotonic dystrophy, porphyria, and some forms of mental illness (e.g., Huntington's disease).

This is the attribution of such a condition to the will of God claiming it has been destined that a person would have such a medical condition. The Yorubas call this kadara or ayanmon (i.e., destiny). Especially in heritable genetic disorders in children and adults, this fatalistic idea prevails. The idea can also be applied in cases of injuries and accidents. This idea serves as a coping mechanism and aids reintegration into the society. Since it is the will of God, discrimination is termed against the will of God. It helps the individual to live and surrender to destiny, fate, or an act of God. Unfortunately, the idea does not help in preventive measure. Fatalistic individuals tend to accept everything that comes their way-if it has been destined, it is beyond human preventive measure.",
