Our arXiv:2005.11975v1 [stat.ME] 25 May 2020 approach is based on an optimal ensemble of two simple methods: a generalized linear mixed regression model which pools information over different areas, and an area-specific non-stationary integer autoregressive methodology. Optimal weights are estimated using a leave-last-out rationale. The approach has been set up and validated during the epidemic in Italy.

The resources of the national health system were not designed to face a large-scale epidemic. The national health system was equipped with a total number of approximately 5200 beds, that was substantially increased very quickly during the spread of the disease [3] . This reversed a trend that started years ago, especially after financial crises, according to which resources allocated to the national health system were progressively cut.",

Most of patients stay in intensive care only for one or few days [4] , even if some of them can stay months. However, ICU length of stay (LOS) due to COVID-19 infection was rather long: a recent study [5] involving 1591 patients admitted in ICUs in Lombardia reported a median length of stay of 9 days (6-13 [95% CI]). Long LOS implied a slower turnover, and increased the risk of collapse of the national ICU system. Indeed, in the absence of measures to flatten the epidemic curve, the number of ICU beds available in Italy would have achieved very quickly 100% occupation, leaving several thousand patients short of the cures needed (see also [3] for a discussion).",

Nevertheless, careful and reliable planning of resources can also aid substantially in controlling the consequences of the epidemics, and likely increase the likelihood of early diagnoses and better care. To respond to the looming threat of shortage of ICU beds, hospitals urgently need to establish and implement policies that more fairly allocate these scarce resources. If hospitals can plan in advance how many ICU beds shall be made available for the nearly following days, capacity can be increased (or decreased) to match the demand. This would avoid the ethical dilemma of severe triaging patients and not admitting those whose lives are not worth saving [6] . In this work we propose one statistical tool of this sort, which can be used to accurately forecast the ICU occupation for the next one to five days. Beds demand in intensive care depends on two factors: the number of COVID-19 patients needing intensive care, and duration of their hospitalisation. Unfortunately, these data are not made available during the Italian outbreak. Public data include, anyway, daily ICU occupation by Region, which we use as a proof of concept.",

Both approaches are subject to certain limitations in our opinion. An obvious limitation of the former approach includes ascertainment bias due to the use of counts of confirmed cases, and inappropriate modeling assumptions (including for instance a Gaussian assumption for log-counts). A model of the SIR family may on the other hand be a very appropriate option. However, SIR-based models require the possibility to precisely estimate several characteristics of the epidemics which are still mostly unknown, and it is well known that changing even slightly the initial conditions can lead to very different results. This is even more difficult as the exposed population is only partially observed [10, 11, 12] .",

            "text": "On January 31, 2020, the Italian Government declared the state of emergency for six months as a consequence of the health risk associated with COVID-19 infection. To inform citizens and make the collected data available, the Department of Civil Protection developed an interactive geographic dashboard (accessible at the addresses http://arcg.is/C1unv (desktop) and http : //arcg.is/081a51 (mobile)) and built a daily updated data githubrepository (CC-BY-4.0 license), with a large number of variables; among them the intensive care defined as number of hospitalized patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) available at the Regional level (20 Italian Regions). In Figure 1 the time series of ICU admission from February 24 until April 16 , 2020 are reported and it appears that several sources of heterogeneity affect the data. The epidemic started at different times across Regions, starting from the North of the country and evolved very differently in each Region, leading to trajectories of different shapes. Population size is also very different across Italian Regions ( Figure 2 ), which are also characterized by different economic and social structures. Moreover, a further heterogeneity source relates to the ICU capacity. In Italy, the health system is Regional-based, so in practice there are 20 different health systems and management choices, local authorities and local policy makers play a fundamental role in the definition of health services capacities, with very few national directives. During the epidemic some of the northern Regions went beyond the capacity of the local system. Figure 3 reports the Regional rate of occupancy (occupancy over capacity 1 ) during the epidemic. Regions are ordered geographically from North to South showing the north-south gradient of the epidemic evolution mostly affecting the northern Regions. It is rather clear that the health systems of northern Regions were under pressure for a longer period and this reflects the difference in the spread of the epidemic. A Regional model that takes into account different sources of heterogeneity and the different timing in the spread of the epidemic is thus required. ",

The first approach pools information over Regions, reducing variance of the final prediction; the second instead can be expected to have a lower bias. The final predictions are then averaged with weights chosen through a leave-last-out method. Furthermore, in order to focus more on the recent trends, we always set T = 15, that is, we use the last two weeks of data to make predictions and ignore previous measurements.",

It can be seen that after the first two weeks, when data available were scarce and a unique weight was used, the absolute and relative errors decreased substantially.

Overall, the performance of the proposal is more than satisfactory. The observed values are all into the 99% confidence intervals, whose length is reasonable and ensure a good representation of the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts. The upper bound of the confidence interval can be used as the worst possible scenario for a specific day and resources should be allocated accordingly to guarantee optimal health services. To be fair, the confidence interval for Puglia is rather wide. However, this is not surprising, as patients were transferred from northern Regions to Puglia for a few days, and daily bursts in the time series of ICU admissions were observed. In the following plot ( Figure 5 ), we provide a focus on some Regions, those whose health systems were under pressure for the longest time. The prediction intervals were slightly wide but reasonable, for instance for Lombardia, the most severely affected Region, the median length was 20% of the predicted occupancy. Median difference between upper limit of the prediction interval and total available beds in the Region is 4.6% in Veneto. We also report data and estimates for Piemonte. This is because the news overlooked the situation in Piemonte, mainly focusing on Lombardia and Veneto.

We have discussed in this paper only one-day ahead predictions, but our approach can also be easily extended to three-days and five-days horizons. From the beginning of this emergency in Italy, the ICU bed capacity was identified as a major bottleneck, to be monitored to avoid the increase in the fatality rate. Accordingly, strong efforts have been dedicated to this issue from government and planners. Our approach was able to predict the demand of ICU beds since the very beginning, showing an improvement in its behavior as long as more data were available.
