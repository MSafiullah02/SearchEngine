Our previous studies have shown that a recombinant SARS-CoV RBD protein fused with human Fc induced highly potent immune responses that completely protected vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV challenge [20], [21]. We have also demonstrated that recombinant Fc fusion proteins containing conserved sequences of hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) of H5N1 influenza virus elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses than those without fusion with Fc that cross-protected mice from divergent strains of H5N1 virus challenge [22], confirming the ability of Fc in the enhancement of immunogenicity of the fusion proteins. The potential mechanism may be associated with its ability to promote correct folding of the fusion proteins, and allow the proteins binding to Fc receptor (FcR)-containing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [23], [24]. Notably, the immunogenicity of human Fc region in mice has no detrimental effect on the immunogenicity of the specific antigen in the fusion proteins, as evidenced by the fact that H5N1 HA1 or MERS-CoV RBD proteins fused with human IgG Fc could elicit high titers of H5N1 influenza virus HA1 or MERS-CoV S1-specific antibody responses, respectively, in vaccinated mice [22], [25].",

As shown in Fig. 2A, a single prime dose i.n. vaccination of RBD-Fc did not elicit significant IgG antibody response, while MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG antibodies rapidly increased to a higher level post-last vaccination. In comparison, a single prime dose s.c. vaccination of RBD-Fc induced a relatively higher level of specific IgG antibody response.

Sera from s.c. and i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc could bind specifically to MERS-CoV S1 protein without fusion with Fc (Fig. 2B), with the endpoint IgG antibody titers reaching similar levels at 1:8.3 \u00d7 104 for s.c., or 1:4.0 \u00d7 104 for i.n., respectively (Fig. 2C), post-last vaccination.

These data suggest that vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein by the i.n., but not by the s.c. route, induced strong local mucosal immune response, as represented by a high level of mucosal IgA.

However, only background level of IgA was detected from mouse lung wash samples of s.c. and i.n. PBS control groups (Fig. 4).

Importantly, SARS-CoV RBD protein control failed to stimulate the splenocytes derived from MERS-CoV RBD-Fc-vaccinated mice, irrespective the routes of immunization. Also, mice immunized via either i.n. or s.c. route in the PBS control group did not reveal any MERS-CoV S1-specific IL-2- or IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell responses. Taken together, these results suggest that vaccination via the i.n. route with MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein has the ability to elicit stronger cellular responses than the s.c. route, as represented by IL-2- and IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells.",

Data from Fig. 6A demonstrated that both i.n. and s.c. vaccinations of RBD-Fc could induce equally strong neutralizing antibody responses against MERS-CoV in immunized mouse sera (P\n > 0.05). Notably, i.n. vaccination of RBD-Fc induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody in the collected mouse lung wash than s.c. vaccination of RBD-Fc, indicating that i.n. immunization with RBD-Fc is able to induce stronger mucosal immune responses with neutralizing activity (Fig. 6B). The s.c. and i.n. PBS control groups only induced a background level of neutralizing antibody titers in both vaccinated mouse sera and lung wash.

As for the adjuvant, we used Poly(I:C) for i.n. vaccination and Montanide ISA 51 for s.c. immunization.

More specifically, both vaccination pathways induced a relatively higher level of Th1-associated IgG2a than Th2-associated IgG1. It should be noted that similar levels of IgG3, which is considered important in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and virus neutralization [37], were detectable in vaccinated mouse sera via both i.n. and s.c. routes. These data suggested that MERS-CoV RBD-Fc immunization by the i.n. route was capable of eliciting similar, if not greater, systemic humoral antibody responses than those elicited by the s.c. pathway in vaccinated mice. Significantly, a similarly high titers of serum neutralizing antibodies were raised in mice vaccinated with 5 doses of RBD-Fc protein via both i.n. and s.c. routes (P\n > 0.05, Fig. 6), about 4-fold higher than that attained from 2 doses of s.c. vaccination of the same protein [18]. That the increase of vaccination doses leads to improved neutralizing antibody titers indicates the need for multiple vaccinations of RBD protein containing residues 377\u2013662 of MERS-CoV S to induce stronger neutralizing antibody responses that can be maintained up to 6 months.",

Accordingly, vaccines capable of inducing strong local mucosal immunity represented by secretory IgA would be helpful in preventing MERS-CoV infection. Our data indicated that MERS-CoV S1-specific IgA antibody responses with neutralizing activity in vaccinated mouse lungs were elicited by i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein, which were significantly higher than those induced by s.c. vaccination of the same protein, confirming the ability of RBD-Fc to induce strong local mucosal immunity via the i.n. route. Our previous studies on SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines demonstrated that induction of mucosal IgA via the i.n. pathway played an important role in preventing SARS-CoV infection. We have previously demonstrated that in the presence of high titer of mucosal IgA, mice with serum neutralizing antibody as low as 1:190 can still be fully protected from SARS-CoV challenge replication [12]. It is thus reasonable to prospect that high titers of local mucosal neutralizing IgA, and serum neutralizing antibodies induced by i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein, as shown in this study, will effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection and protect the animals from MERS-CoV challenge.",

Similarly, when compared to the s.c. route adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 51, we found that MERS-CoV RBD-Fc was able to induce a higher frequency of MERS-CoV S1-specific, IL-2-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in vaccinated mouse spleens through the i.n. route in the presence of Poly(I:C) adjuvant. The higher cellular immune responses induced by RBD-Fc vaccination through the i.n. route, compared to the s.c. route, are possibly because of different adjuvants used in the corresponding pathway. It was reported that that s.c.-vaccination of a cancer vaccine formulated with Montanide ISA 51 and Picibanil OK-432 adjuvants is able to induce antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in majority of the vaccinated patients [43], while i.n. administration of Yersinia pestis LcrV protein fused to anti-DEC antibody adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) induced high frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD4+ T cells as well as IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1/IL-2-secreting polyfunctional CD4+ T cells in the airway and lung of vaccinated mice [44]. Thus, further optimization of the MERS-CoV candidate vaccines in the presence of different adjuvants is essential to evaluate the roles of cellular immune response, in addition to humoral and mucosal immunity, in protecting against MERS-CoV infection once an animal challenge model for MERS becomes available.",

We found that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induced systemic humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and significantly higher local (lung) mucosal immune responses in the vaccinated mice. Therefore, our results suggest the possibility of developing this protein into an effective and safe mucosal MERS vaccine for preventing MERS-CoV infection and stopping further spread of MERS-CoV.",
