            "text": "Significant cost and safety issues occur when the demand for hospital resources is not matched by the supply of these resources [1]. When demand exceeds supply, unsafe conditions arise due to less availability of resources, which can cause increased mortality and the rate of medical errors [2, 3]. Conversely, when supply exceeds demand, excess clinician staffing can produce significant cost with no benefit to patient care quality. Hospital management must actively manage the supply of fixed resources, such as beds and specialized equipment, and variable resources, such as nurses, technicians, and providers, that affect care quality and ensure patient safety. Matching supply to demand is difficult because the future patient resource demands are random and unknown, while the resource supply is often set far in advance and is difficult to adjust in the short term significantly.",

            "text": "Uncertainty in patient resource demand is caused by several stochastic processes, including the number and timing of arrivals and discharges, length of stay (LOS), unit transfers, health improvement and deterioration, surgical complications, and same-day cancellations for outpatient and surgical appointments. Variability arises from disease seasonality, holidays, and the numerous types of specialized staff, physical resources, ailments, procedures, allergies, comorbidities, and surgical techniques. Additional variability is created when surgeries are scheduled without anticipating and managing the aggregate downstream resource requirements, such as the time needed in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or intensive care unit (ICU). The aggregate patient resource demand several weeks in the future, which is the time period for which clinician shifts are being scheduled, is often significantly different from the current demand. Short-term staffing adaptations are made to manage the mismatch of resource supply and demand, such as incorporating on-call and per diem staff and canceling unnecessary shifts.",

Proactive is harder than reactive adaptation, in which the mismatch of supply and demand already exists, which is relatively simple to measure and align. The cost of a staffing adaptation is typically dependent upon its magnitude and timing, and thus requires a forecast that is both accurate and lengthy to be cost-effective. Developing and applying an accurate model to forecast patient resource demand for multiple time periods into the future improves both the cost and safety of providing care when coupled with an adaptive staffing strategy.",

The random variable representing not-yet-scheduled patients present at period t, with mean and variance as shown in Eq. 8, is thus represented by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\gamma}_d^{nysch}(t) $$\\end{document}\u03b3dnyscht.8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\displaystyle \\begin{array}{c}E\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{nysch}(t)\\right]= Var\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{nysch}(t)\\right]=\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_{b=1}^s\\sum \\limits_v^V\\left[{\\lambda}_v\\left(b,s\\right)\\times \\left(1-\\sum \\limits_{h=0}^{t-s}{f}_v(h)\\right)\\right]\\\\ {}=\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_{b=1}^s\\sum \\limits_v^V\\left[{\\lambda}_v\\left(b,s\\right)\\times \\left(1-{F}_v\\left(t-s\\right)\\right)\\right]\\\\ {}=\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_{b=1}^s\\sum \\limits_v^V\\left[{\\lambda}_v\\left(b,s\\right)\\times {R}_v\\left(t-s\\right)\\right]\\end{array}} $$\\end{document}E\u03b3dnyscht=Var\u03b3dnyscht=\u2211s=1t\u2211b=1s\u2211vV\u03bbvbs\u00d71\u2212\u2211h=0t\u2212sfvh=\u2211s=1t\u2211b=1s\u2211vV\u03bbvbs\u00d71\u2212Fvt\u2212s=\u2211s=1t\u2211b=1s\u2211vV\u03bbvbs\u00d7Rvt\u2212s",

This is partly because it has an infinite domain and the number of unique combinations of the PB distribution is equal to 2(M + N), where M + N is the number of known patients, which exceeds one trillion with just 40 known patients. Instead of calculating the complete convolution of \u0393d(t), an approximation using the normal distribution is obtained using the mean and variance of forecasted patient demand. The mean, as shown in Eq. 9, is the sum of Eqs. 2, 5, 7, and 8, and the variance, as shown in Eq. 10, is the sum of Eqs. 3, 6, 7, and 8. This Normal distribution, as well as the underlying convolution that includes a Poisson distribution, both have infinite domains. These distributions represent the demand for beds, and can thus exceed the hospital unit capacity. When calculating the bed demand, this Normal distribution should be truncated at zero, and when predicting the bed occupancy, this Normal distribution should be truncated at both zero and the hospital unit capacity.9\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ E\\left[{\\Gamma}_d(t)\\right]=E\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{curr}(t)\\right]+E\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{sch}(t)\\right]+E\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{emer}(t)\\right]+E\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{nysch}(t)\\right]=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^M{R}_i\\left(t-d\\right)+\\sum \\limits_{j=1}^N{R}_j\\left(t-{s}_j\\right)+\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_u^U\\left[{\\lambda}_u(s)\\times {R}_u\\left(t-s\\right)\\right]+\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_{b=1}^s\\sum \\limits_v^V\\left[{\\lambda}_v\\left(b,s\\right)\\times {R}_v\\left(t-s\\right)\\right] $$\\end{document}E\u0393dt=E\u03b3dcurrt+E\u03b3dscht+E\u03b3demert+E\u03b3dnyscht=\u2211i=1MRit\u2212d+\u2211j=1NRjt\u2212sj+\u2211s=1t\u2211uU\u03bbus\u00d7Rut\u2212s+\u2211s=1t\u2211b=1s\u2211vV\u03bbvbs\u00d7Rvt\u2212s10\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ Var\\left[{\\Gamma}_d(t)\\right]= Var\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{curr}(t)\\right]+ Var\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{sch}(t)\\right]+ Var\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{emer}(t)\\right]+ Var\\left[{\\gamma}_d^{nysch}(t)\\right]=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^M\\left[{F}_i\\left(t-d\\right)\\times {R}_i\\left(t-d\\right)\\right]+\\sum \\limits_{j=1}^N\\left[{F}_j\\left(t-{s}_j\\right)\\times {R}_j\\left(t-{s}_j\\right)\\right]+\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_u^U\\left[{\\lambda}_u(s)\\times {R}_u\\left(t-s\\right)\\right]+\\sum \\limits_{s=1}^t\\sum \\limits_{b=1}^s\\sum \\limits_v^V\\left[{\\lambda}_v\\left(b,s\\right)\\times {R}_v\\left(t-s\\right)\\right] $$\\end{document}Var\u0393dt=Var\u03b3dcurrt+Var\u03b3dscht+Var\u03b3demert+Var\u03b3dnyscht=\u2211i=1MFit\u2212d\u00d7Rit\u2212d+\u2211j=1NFjt\u2212sj\u00d7Rjt\u2212sj+\u2211s=1t\u2211uU\u03bbus\u00d7Rut\u2212s+\u2211s=1t\u2211b=1s\u2211vV\u03bbvbs\u00d7Rvt\u2212s",

            "text": "The case where all LOS distributions are deterministic, meaning no uncertainty in LOS, such that all variance comes from unknown future patients, is the theoretical lowest-variance forecast. In this case, the mean and variance of the PB random variable would become an integer constant and zero, respectively. Thus, the distribution of the forecasted PMF with the lowest variance is a translated Poisson random variable that is translated by the amount equal to the expected value of the PB random variable. If a forecast is made equal to the mean of this translated Poisson random variable, then the expected MAE of the forecasted PMF with the lowest variance can be obtained as shown in Eq. 13, where \u03bb + c and \u03bb represent the mean and variance of the translated Poisson (TP) random variable, respectively. The proof is shown in the appendix. Note that \u230a\u03bb\u230b represents the largest integer less than or equal to \u03bb. Translating the Poisson random variable does not affect the expected MAE, and the result in Eq. 13 can be further reduced, as shown in Eq. 14, where fP represents the PMF of a standard Poisson random variable with a mean of \u03bb. To calculate the theoretical best expected value of a multi-period forecast with non-homogenous Poisson random variables, the value in Eq. 14 must be averaged for all periods, using the actual number of arrivals to estimate \u03bb. Figure 2 shows the expected MAE for a single Poisson random variable as a function of \u03bb.13\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ E\\left[{MAE}_{TP}\\right]=\\sum \\limits_{k=c}^{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor +c}\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\lambda }{\\lambda}^{\\left(k-c\\right)}}{\\left(k-c\\right)!}\\right)\\left(\\lambda +c-k\\right)+\\sum \\limits_{k=\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor +c+1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\lambda }{\\lambda}^{\\left(k-c\\right)}}{\\left(k-c\\right)!}\\right)\\left(k-\\lambda -c\\right)=\\frac{2{e}^{-\\lambda }{\\lambda}^{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor +1}}{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor !} $$\\end{document}EMAETP=\u2211k=c\u03bb+ce\u2212\u03bb\u03bbk\u2212ck\u2212c!\u03bb+c\u2212k+\u2211k=\u03bb+c+1\u221ee\u2212\u03bb\u03bbk\u2212ck\u2212c!k\u2212\u03bb\u2212c=2e\u2212\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb+1\u03bb!14\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ E\\left[{MAE}_P\\right]=\\frac{2{e}^{-\\lambda }{\\lambda}^{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor +1}}{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor !}=2\\lambda \\frac{e^{-\\lambda }{\\lambda}^{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor }}{\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor !}=2\\lambda {f}_P\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\lambda \\right\\rfloor \\right) $$\\end{document}EMAEP=2e\u2212\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb+1\u03bb!=2\u03bbe\u2212\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb!=2\u03bbfP\u03bb",

Improving LOS distributions could be accomplished via real-time updating from electronic medical records, including data on age, gender, medical history, and list of orders, to drive personalized classification and regression models.

Applying the forecasting model to a hospital that predominantly sees scheduled patients relative to emergency patients could significantly reduce the MAE of the predictions. In addition, because the curve in Fig. 2 is concave down, the rate of expected MAE increase is slower than the rate of the increase of the mean of unknown patients, meaning this forecasting model should produce a smaller ratio of MAE to mean census at larger hospitals with similar LOS distributions.",

The estimations hold well within the range of about two standard deviations, indicated by little deviation from the 45-degree line. However, the 1-day high outliers are above the 45-degree line, indicating that the upper tail of the normal distribution estimate may be too thin to fit the real data. This makes sense given that Poisson distributions have positive skew and most of the forecast is driven by the underlying Poisson random variable for unknown patients. The Q-Q plots for other forecast lengths tend to have high outliers below the 45-degree line, suggesting that consistent multi-day volume increases may be mitigated over several days via reduced LOS or fewer scheduled surgeries. A prominent outlier occurs on the night of June 4th, 2016, when the 1-day forecast from the previous day had an error Z-score of \u22123.8, and a 2-day forecast Z-score of \u22124.2.

Incorporating natural language processing to read the clinician notes would further improve the accuracy of the patient-level parameters. The difference in accuracy between the case study accuracy and theoretical best accuracy demonstrates the value in improving these parameters. As these parameter errors compound, the gap between the theoretical best accuracy and the model accuracy widens. Furthermore, error can exist within the input parameters themselves, in addition to the inherent error of any probability not equaling zero or one. This model assumes that probabilistic input parameters have been accurately determined, and an opportunity for future work would be to analyze the effect of poor parameter estimation on the aggregate demand prediction.",
