            "text": "Infections, predominantly bacterial in nature, are not uncommon in patients with cirrhosis and these are associated with high morbidity and mortality [1]. In these patients, infections are a consequence of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms such as gut dysbiosis, increased bacterial translocation, portosystemic shunting, cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction (CAID), liver dysfunction, and genetic factors [2, 3]. The most frequent infections are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and urinary tract infection (UTI) while pneumonia, cellulitis, and bacteremia are not uncommon [4]. Community-acquired bacterial infections account for about 30% of all infections followed by healthcare acquired in approximately 30% and nosocomial infections in 35\u201340% [5, 6]. Recent epidemiological data has shown that the incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is increasing, especially in healthcare-associated settings [6, 7]. MDR bacteria\u2013associated infections have the worst prognosis and are associated with higher rates of treatment failure, septic shock, and high mortality [4\u20136]. Preventive measures, early diagnosis, and adequate treatment of infections are potentially decreasing morbidity and mortality.",

High production of nitric oxide (NO) inducing vasodilatation and portal hypertension may further facilitate bacterial overgrowth [18, 20\u201322]. IBO can then result in bacterial translocation (BT) and liver inflammation [4]. BT is defined as the migration of microorganisms or bacterial endotoxins from the intestinal lumen to the mesenteric lymph nodes or systemic circulation. The most common bacteria involved in BT are derived from the family of Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Klebsiella spp., etc.), Enterococci, and Streptococci spp. These multiple mechanisms can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, including hemodynamic instability, high proinflammatory cytokine levels, development of severe or recurrent infections, ACLF, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and these associated with poor prognosis [18]. Data from 181 patients in The North American Consortium for Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) cohort showed that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (particularly changes in Proteobacteria constituents; e.g., Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacteraceae, and Pasteurellaceae) associates with increased risk of extra-hepatic organ failure, ACLF, and death [23].",

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from enteric bacterial organisms and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), originating from the host tissue upon injury, bring into pattern recognition and activation of immune cells causing systemic inflammation [16]. Further, genetic polymorphisms of immunity pathways may lead to variation in immune responses and infection susceptibilities. Genetic variations coding for pattern recognition receptors (PRR), especially NOD2 and TLR2 variants causing impairment of innate host defense mechanisms, have been associated with SBP susceptibility, and markers of impaired intestinal permeability with higher systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis [4, 28].",

A large multicenter prospective study of 1343 patients hospitalized from acute decompensation of cirrhosis \u201cCANONIC study\u201d (in the context of EASL-CLIF Consortium) established a definition and categorized grading which defines short-term mortality (ACLF grades 1\u20133, mortality 22% to 77%) [29, 30]. In this study, bacterial infection was the most common identifiable precipitating factor for ACLF (33%), followed by active alcoholism (25%). Among bacterial infections, SBP and pneumonia were the most frequent sites of infection associated with ACLF. Severity of infection, such as sepsis or septic shock, also correlated with ACLF. The presence or types of precipitating events were not related to mortality, but prognosis depended more on the numbers of organ failures (OFs). In this context, the presence of OFs assessed by the CLIF-SOFA or the CLIF-C OF scores was associated with 28-day and 90-day mortality and it has been suggested that ACLF grading be determined to assess mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ACLF. During hospitalization, the majority of patients have been noted to achieve Grade 3 ACLF within the first week. Therefore, the next assessment, since admission, of ACLF grade at days 3\u20137 with a new scoring system \u201cCLIF-C ACLF score\u201d is suggested as it has a significantly higher predictive accuracy than MELD, MELD-Na, and Child-Pugh-Turcotte score at all main time points after ACLF diagnosis; it has a significantly higher area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for prediction of 28-day and 90-day mortality [30].",

The most frequently encountered infections were UTI (28.5%) and SBP (22.5%) while other infections included spontaneous bacteremia (13.2%), skin/soft tissue (12.2%), respiratory (9.9%), miscellaneous (9.6%), and C. difficile (4.1%). Nosocomial infections, often due to drug-resistant organisms, were found as first infections in 15.8%, and were frequently related to in-hospital procedures, and the use of medications (antibiotics, proton pump inhibitor, or SBP prophylaxis). Most commonly, the infections were due to gram-positive organisms (32.9%), followed by gram-negative (26.8%), and fungi (17.6%); no organisms were isolated in 22.7% [32\u2022\u2022]. Thus, the current epidemiological pattern is of the majority being non-SBP infections, domination by gram-positive organisms, and large proportion of nosocomial infections. In addition, second infections developed during hospitalization were encountered in 21.6% of the patients (UTI 32%, respiratory infections 25%, and SBP 12.5%), and were also associated with poor survival. Some of the hospitalized patients with bacterial infection developed OFs (1-OF 37%, 2-OFs 10%, and 3-OFs 10%). Poor predictors found to be associated with development of ACLF were nosocomial infections, high baseline MELD, low mean arterial pressure (MAP), and non-SBP infections. Independent predictors of poor 30-day survival were I-ACLF (a simple bedside tool, defined as \u2265 2 OFs: shock, grade III\u2013IV HE, ventilation, renal replacement therapy), second infections, high admission MELD, high white blood cell count, and low albumin [32\u2022\u2022]. Similar to the CANONIC study, the numbers of OFs were found to be an important predictor of overall survival in those with ACLF. In liver transplant\u2013listed patients, in the NACSELD experience, there was a 42% risk of delisting/death within a 6-month period following an episode of infection due to multiple organ failures, making it likely the main reason for delisting/death among liver transplant\u2013listed patients [33\u2022].",

While a positive ascitic fluid culture is not essential for the diagnosis of SBP, ascitic and blood culture should still be performed before starting antibiotics as organisms can be isolated in 40\u201360% of cases [5, 8]. Levels of ascitic fluid lactoferrin (AFLAC) have been noted to be elevated in SBP. In a prospective study conducted at tertiary centers (218 ascites samples/148 patients) using a cut-off level of 242 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of SBP were 95.5% and 97%, respectively [41]. Another prospective study from South Korea (182 patients) noted a sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 74.4% at a cut-off level of 51.4 ng/mL [42]; however, further validation studies are still needed for it to be recommended in clinical practice.

Extensive drug resistance (XDR) bacteria, defined by a non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories and pan-drug resistance (PDR) bacteria defined by a non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories [46], may require combination of antibiotics including highly nephrotoxic agents such as vancomycin or aminoglycosides where, if used, plasma levels need to be monitored. Prompt de-escalation based on bacterial susceptibility is highly recommended in order to minimize evolution of a resistant strain [37\u2022\u2022].

Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins in combination with oxacillin, or piperacillin-tazobactam, should be promptly initiated. (Table 1).",

A study in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and with a culture-positive infection during 2008\u20132014 (n = 185) noted an approximate 10% rate of fungal infections (8 (4.3%) combined bacterial and fungal infection, and 11 (6%) fungal infection only). In the fungal infection group, spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) with positive ascitic fluid culture was in 58%(n = 11/19) and fungemia (positive blood culture) without SFP was in 42% (n = 8/19). Most fungal infections were due to Candida spp., with C. albicans and nearly all Candida species were sensitive to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and voriconazole. Nine (47.4%) of the fungal infections were nosocomial infections and seven (36.8%) were healthcare-associated [74]. Mortality rates at 1 month and 6 months were 57.9% and 89.5%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those with bacterial infections. Fungal infections may occur with or without bacterial infections, but often are in those with impaired renal function (creatinine 1.6 vs 1.1 mg/dL; p = 0.034) and in healthcare-associated/nosocomial settings (100% vs 28.3%; p = 0.007). Ascitic fluid characteristics cannot distinguish SFP from SBP. Therefore, hemoculture, ascitic fluid culture for fungi, and empiric use of anti-fungal agents may be considered in those patients with cirrhosis and with nosocomial infections who are not responding to empirical antibiotics therapy [74]. In the NACSELD cohort (n = 2743), 134 patients (12.7% of infected patients) had evidence of fungal infections, all of which were nosocomial. The rate of fungal infections did not correlate with the etiology of cirrhosis. A multi-variable analysis noted that diabetes, acute kidney injury, ICU admission, and admission bacterial infection were associated with fungal infections (AUC = 0.82). Further, fungal infections were associated with ACLF and poor 30-day survival [75].",

            "text": "Superimposed infection with hepatitis A or B in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [80, 81]. As immunogenicity to vaccinations has correlated inversely with the degree of hepatic decompensation [82], early immunization against hepatitis A and B prior to the stage of hepatic decompensation is the optimal strategy. Hepatitis A vaccination in patients with decompensated cirrhosis had low seroconversion rates of about 49\u201366% [79, 83, 84], and thus this group of patients may benefit from post-vaccination serologic testing to evaluate response. Similarly, hepatitis B vaccination has been noted to be safe and with high seroconversion rates in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease, but has reduced efficacy in advanced chronic liver disease and in those who underwent liver transplantation [85\u201387]. Weight and age of the patients are also factors associated with the response rate. Thus, patients with chronic liver disease should be vaccinated before the onset of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis if possible by conventional hepatitis B vaccination series. Although patients with cirrhosis may benefit from a high-dose or double-dose (40 \u03bcg) strategy (68% response rate) [88] than standard doses (16\u201320% response rate) [89\u201391], it remains controversial. As such, a double-dose vaccination is only recommended in other immunocompromised status (e.g., HIV, hemodialysis, on chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant) [50]. However, from our perspective, patients with cirrhosis who do not achieve seroconversion (Anti-HBs > 10 mIU/mL) following a vaccination course may benefit from a second double-dose (40 \u03bcg) regimen (Table 2).",
