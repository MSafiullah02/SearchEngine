The majority of infectious disease models consider the spread of infection from one host to another and are sometimes grouped together as \u201cmathematical epidemiology.\u201d A growing body of work considers the spread of infection within an individual, often with a particular focus on interactions between the infectious agent and the host\u2019s immune responses. Such models are sometimes grouped together as \u201cwithin-host models.\u201d Most recently, new models have been developed that consider host\u2013pathogen interactions at two levels simultaneously: both within-host dynamics and between-host transmissions. Infectious disease models vary widely in their complexity, in their attempts to refer to data from real-life infections and in their focus on problems of an applied or more fundamental nature. This entry will focus on simpler models tightly tied to data and aimed at addressing well-defined practical problems.",

A useful parameter that summarizes this ease of spread is the \u201cbasic reproductive number is the number of secondary infections caused during the entire duration of one infection if all contacts are susceptible (i.e., can be infected). The concept has widespread currency in the literature on infectious disease models with varying degrees of affection [3]. There is no question that it has been a useful, simple rule of thumb for characterizing how easily an infection can spread [4]. Furthermore, the simplest of calculations relate R0 to the degree of intervention needed to bring an infection under control and, eventually, eradicate it. The relationship between the basic reproductive number and disease control arises from the simple fact that if each infectious person causes less than one secondary case, then the number of infections must fall. If it is always true, even when there is no infection circulating, that each new case causes less than one secondary case, then the infection will die out. This simple observation leads to a straightforward calculation for the proportion of a population that must be vaccinated in order to achieve eradication, pc:5.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ {{\\text{p}}_{\\text{c}}} = {1} - \\frac{{1}}{{{{\\text{R}}_0}}} $$\n\\end{document}\n",

Because vaccination acts to extend the time between epidemics (Fig. 5.1b), it also acts to increase the average age at infection. This sets up a complex trade-off when introducing rubella vaccination to a community. On the one hand, vaccinated girls are protected from catching rubella at any age, but on the other hand, the girls who remain unvaccinated are likely to catch rubella when they are older, more likely to be in their childbearing years and so at greater risk of CRS. This means that vaccination with low coverage can actually lead to more CRS, and only when coverage levels get above a certain level do the benefits of vaccinating the community outweigh the costs.

Firstly, Eq. 5.6 calculates the number of cases of infection of a given age over time. Since the main consideration in balancing up the pros and cons of rubella vaccination is the number of cases in women of childbearing age, this is an essential model output. Secondly, the per capita rate at which susceptibles become infected depends on their age and on the age of all the infected people. This model is thus able to take account of the complexities of family, school, and working life which drive people of different ages to age-dependent patterns of mixing. Thirdly, the recovery rate \u03b3(a) and, more importantly, the background death rate \u03bc(a) can both be made to depend on age. Since a fixed per capita death rate is a particularly bad approximation of human survival, this is another important advance on models without age structure.",

The model classifies farms into four groups: susceptible, incubating, infectious, or slaughtered. As in all epidemic models, the heart of the model is the per capita rate at which susceptible farms become infected \u2013 the so-called force of infection.

Here, they are illustrated with two examples, a set of models that consider the emergence of a zoonotic infection in humans and a model of the within-host evolution and between-host transmission of HIV.",

The pandemics of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 swine flu in 2009 illustrated how quickly a new infectious agent spreads around the world. Neither of these was as devastating as some predicted, but the continuing pandemic of HIV is ample proof that emerging infectious diseases can have devastating consequences for human communities. Many novel emerging infections arise as zoonoses \u2013 that is, infections that cross from animals into humans [22]. To become a successful emerging infection of humans \u2013 that is, one that spreads widely amongst people \u2013 is a multi-step process [23]. First, the pathogen must cross the species barrier into people, then it must transmit between people, and finally, it must transmit efficiently enough that epidemics arise. This latter step amounts to having a basic reproductive number, R0, that is greater than 1. The emerging infections mentioned already, SARS, swine flu, and HIV, have transited all these steps. But there are other zoonoses that transmit to humans without emerging as epidemics or pandemics. For example, simian foamy virus, a retrovirus that is endemic in most old-world primates [24], can be detected in people who work with primates [25] or hunt them [26]. There is no record of any human-to-human transmission, implying that this zoonosis only completes the first step in becoming an emerging infection. Other infections, whilst spreading from person to person, still do not cause epidemics because that spread is insufficiently efficient. An example of such an infection is the newly discovered arenavirus from Southern Africa called \u201cLujo virus\u201d [27]. This virus caused a small outbreak in the autumn of 2008. Very dramatically, four out of the five known cases died, but with five cases and just four transmission events, the basic reproductive number stayed below one, and there was no epidemic.",

They developed a multi-type branching process model of the transmission and evolution of a zoonosis. They found that the probability of emergence depends very strongly on the basic reproductive number of the pathogen as it crosses into humans. This is because, even when R0 < 1, short chains of transmission are still possible (as exemplified with Lujo virus described above). During ongoing infections in humans, the zoonosis has opportunities to evolve towards higher transmissibility. The higher its initial R0, the more opportunities there are for such ongoing evolution and hence for emergence.",

Kubiak and colleagues explored the emergence of a novel infection in populations split into several communities, with commuters acting to join those communities together. They found that most communities are sufficiently interconnected to show no effect of spatial distribution on the emergence process, even a small number of commuters being sufficient to successfully transmit any novel pathogen between settlements. Thus, although many zoonotic events happen in isolated parts of the world, unless they are really cut off from urban centers, that isolation offers little barrier to the transmission of newly emerged infections.",

HIV variants that cannot be recognized by current host CTLs are termed \u201cCTL escape mutants.\u201d These mutants yield important information about the strength of the immune responses that they evade.

When CTL escape mutants are transmitted into a host who does not make immune response to that epitope, the mutations are no longer advantageous, and the virus can revert to the wild type [35]. Global change in the prevalence of CTL escape mutants is therefore driven by three parallel processes: the selection of escape mutants in some hosts, transmission between hosts, and reversion of escape mutants in other hosts. Once again, this is a process that takes place across multiple levels of organization, evolution and reversion of escape mutations within infected hosts, and transmission between hosts.",

The model allows heterogeneity in hosts and in the infecting virus so that there are hosts who do and do not mount immune responses to a given epitope and there are viruses that do and do not have escape mutations in that epitope. This model is represented in Fig. 5.4. As in the SIR model described in section \u201cThe SIR Model,\u201d the rate at which susceptibles become infected is determined by the number of infectious people present.

Figure 5.5a shows total cases through time. The total epidemic goes through three phases: an initial exponential growth, a saturation phase, and then settling to a long-term equilibrium. Figure 5.5b shows the proportion of all cases that are escape mutants through time. Not surprisingly, faster escape rates and slower reversion rates lead to higher prevalence of escape mutants. Less intuitive are the following characteristics of Fig. 5.5b. Whilst the epidemic is in its exponential growth phase, so long as reversion rates are reasonably fast (say once in 10 years or faster), the prevalence of escape is expected to stabilize quite quickly. However, this is not a long-term equilibrium, and as the total epidemic turns over, the escape prevalence shifts again. For an epitope that escapes fast but reverts at an intermediate rate, this leads to a substantial drop in the prevalence of escape. Secondly, fixation of escape variants only occurs if they never revert, and even then fixation takes a very long time \u2013 much longer than it takes for the underlying epidemic to equilibrate. Thirdly, the predicted dynamics and equilibrium are very sensitive to the reversion rate when that is slow. Notice the big difference, in the long term, between no reversion (brown line) and average time to reversion of 50 years (yellow line).\n",
