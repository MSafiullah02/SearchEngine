In addition, staff may become colonized with hospital organisms without ill effects, leading to the possibility of patients becoming infected from a colonized member of staff. MRSA is perhaps the best-known example of this problem. Recommended routine infection control procedures to be followed in the care of any patient are listed in Table 11 .1.",

Aseptic insertion and manipulation of intravascular devices is crucial, the general principles of infection control; hand washing, sterile environment, and wearing of PPE should be followed to protect both the patient and the healthcare worker. Aseptic technique does not automatically necessitate sterile gloves; a \"no-touch\" technique may be equally as effective with nonsterile disposable gloves for peripheral cannulae. Where the consequences of infection are increased, especially with central venous The risks of acquiring an infection from an intravascular device is directly proportional to the length of time that the line/device has been in place. Removal of unneeded lines is, therefore, of great importance. Peripheral lines carry less infection risk than central lines, and substitution of peripheral for central lines should occur as soon as possible. Some studies suggest that antibioticcoated lines reduce infection risk, but no studies have ever demonstrated effi cacy using clinically relevant end points to our knowledge. Routine, prophylactic line changes have not been shown to reduce the risk of infection and are associated with increased complications. Guidelines for the prevention of catheter-related infection have been produced by the North American Center for Disease Control. 5 Cannulae-related infection is very common in the critically ill. In the pyrexial patient who has been on the ITU for a number of days, line-related sepsis is very likely. In this situation, all lines should be removed, cultured, and replaced as needed.",
