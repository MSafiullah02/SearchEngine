For this, we observe individuals within cities that contain one of the 500 most frequently used airports worldwide (based on annual total passenger number). Individuals within the model can be susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (R).

This gives a much more realistic estimate of the actual spreading pattern as not only the existence of a flight connection but the specific number of passengers that flow over that link is taken into account.

Second, spreading was observed only in one season, summer. Previous work23 has pointed out that the actual spreading pattern differs for different seasons. Third, only the 500 airports with the largest traffic volume rather than all 3,968 airports were included in the simulation. While this was done in order to be comparable with the earlier study of Hufnagel et al.5, tests on the larger dataset would be interesting.
