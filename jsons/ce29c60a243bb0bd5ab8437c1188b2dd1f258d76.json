The pandemic had a reproduction value of approximately 1.5 and appeared to exhibit a community transmissibility similar to the respiratory pathogen SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Even though the most commonly affected age group was 5-45 years old, the influenza also affected other age groups, such as older adults, pregnant women and children. By the end of the pandemic in 2010, it was registered that the virus caused the death of around twenty thousand people all over the world, and it was fueled by the mobility between regions and different countries. In [1] the authors studied the role of travel restrictions in halting pandemics, by using short-range mobility data, and explored alternative scenarios by assessing the potential impact of mobility restrictions. However, although this strategy could be very effective, it was found only useful to slow down the spread of the diseases, which might give time to the health authorities to develop a better strategy to stop the epidemic, for example the development of a new vaccine. Fortunately, in the case of the H1N1 pandemic, it was possible to develop and deploy a vaccination campaign, just in time to prevent a further spreading of the disease.",

            "text": "It is well known that infectious diseases usually spread by physical contact between individuals in a society [2, 3] . Over the years, researchers have found that the best way to model these types of contact patterns [4] [5] [6] is by using the topology of complex networks [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , where people are represented by nodes, and their interactions, as links. A commonly-used model for reproducing the dynamics of the spreading of endemic diseases, such as seasonal influenza or SARS [12] , is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [13] [14] [15] . This model groups individuals of a population into three compartments according to their state: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). When a susceptible individual is in contact with an infected one, it becomes infected with probability \u03b2, which is the same for everyone. Infected individuals recover after a period of time t r , i.e., they become immunized and cannot be infected again or infect others. When the parameters \u03b2 and t r are constant, the effective probability of infection is given by the transmissibility [16, 17] . The SIR model has a tree-like structure with branches of infection that develop and expand, and this is because infected individuals cannot be re-infected, so the infection can only move forwards. It has been proven that this process can be mapped into link percolation [18, 19] , and thus the dynamic can be described using the generating function framework. The most important property in this framework is the probability f that a branch of infection will expand throughout the network [19] . When a branch of infection reaches a node with k connections across one of its links, it can only expand through its k \u2212 1 remaining connections. It can be shown that f verifies the",

The spread of epidemics in networks [20] [21] [22] [23] have been the focus of motivation of several investigations that seek to develop and study different strategies of mitigation for decreasing the impact of diseases on healthy populations [13, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . On one hand, referring to non-pharmaceutical strategies, one of the most common and studied is \"quarantine\", in which all individuals of the affected population must remain in isolation for a period of time. This scenario is difficult to perform, besides it involves a great economic loss. On the other hand, a more moderate strategy proposed is \"social distancing\" [29, 30] , in which those susceptible individuals distance themselves from those infected individuals or from those who present the symptoms of the disease. Although all these strategies are beneficial, but with no doubt the most effective one is \"vaccination\" [31] if available. In the early times random vaccination has been studied [32] . In this protocol susceptible individuals are vaccinated regardless of whether there are or not in contact with an infected individual. However, this strategy requires a huge amount of vaccines and resources that may not be available. One way to improve this strategy is targeted vaccination [33] , that is to vaccinate those people that have many connections, and therefore, higher probability of getting the disease and transmitting it. However, this strategy is difficult to implement, since the degrees of nodes in the network must be known in detail. In [34] , the authors proposed the acquaintance immunization strategy which does not require knowledge of degrees. They choose a number of nodes at random and point for each one of his nearest neighbors. Then, those nearest neighbors are selected for immunization. So, given that a randomly chosen link points with high probability to a high degree node, this is actually a preferential immunization of the hubs, which reduces dramatically the amount of vaccines needed.",

We assume that an epidemic occurs in a realization if the number of recovered individuals is greater than 200 [60, 61] .

For instance, for the case of \u03c9 = 0.8 there is a noticeable difference in \u03b2 c for the different q. However, it can be seen that qualitatively, the behavior of the curves, for R and V, are very similar regardless the overlap.

Besides, as \u03c9 increases the critical threshold \u03b2 c also increases, i.e, as we vaccinate with higher probability a more virulent disease will be needed to reach the entire system. This behavior can be seen in the inset of the figures, where we plot \u03b2 c as a function of \u03c9. Notice that for \u03c9 0.8 the disease never becomes an epidemic.",

            "text": "In summary, we studied a novel model of dynamic vaccination on a system of the topology of two partially overlapped multiplex network, where q is the fraction of overlapped nodes between them. In our model, susceptible individuals in contact with infected patients have the opportunity to be vaccinated before the their neighbors attempt to infect them. That is, each time an infected person comes in contact with a susceptible individual, this one will try to get vaccinated with probability \u03c9 and if he does not succeed he will be infected with probability \u03b2. Each infected node is assumed to recover after t r time steps and will become immunized. Besides, vaccinated nodes are also immunized and can not be infected or infect others. Mapping this process into bond percolation and using the framework of generating functions, we analyzed analytically the total fraction of recovered and vaccinated nodes in the steady state as a function of the virulence of the diseases \u03b2 for different values of the \u03c9 and q, and we found a perfect agreement between the theoretical and the simulation results. As expected we find that as \u03c9 increases the epidemic threshold \u03b2 c becomes larger, and disappearing for very large values of \u03c9. We also find a peak, for certain values of the parameters, in the fraction of vaccinated nodes as a function of \u03c9, which is determined by the competition between the vaccination strategy and the spread of the disease. We find an interesting phase diagram in the plane \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c9, where we can see an epidemic phase, which diminish as q and \u03c9 increase, and a non-epidemic phase, where the diseases can not spread. A remarkable result of the phase diagram is that for certain values of q and \u03c9, regardless of the virulence of the disease, it will never become an epidemic. Finally, we demonstrate that our strategy is much more efficient than random immunization. In our model, vaccines are used in a more effective manner and therefore the total fraction of recovered individuals is lower. In this section we show the dependence on the overall transmissibility T \u03b2 of the recovered and vaccinated fraction of nodes, R and V , in the steady state. Also, we show the dependence on the prefactors that multiply Eqs. (4) and (5), which measure the relative weight of the probabilities of infection (or vaccination) in the dynamic.",

The process continues until the fourth temporary step, which is the steady state, where there are no more infected individuals that can continue spreading the disease. three susceptible neighbors: one gets vaccinated, the other becomes infected, as well as his counterpart in network B, while the last remains susceptible. In network B there are two infected individuals, of which only one manages to infect one of its neighbors.
