For each resident, we calculated the modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics scores, developed and published by Linn et al in 1968 for the compilation and quantification of health problems in older adults. In addition, we recorded the number of drugs and the number of antibiotics for respiratory infections prescribed during the symptomatic phase. According to the French immunization schedule, an annual influenza vaccination is required for health care workers and NH residents; it is also recommended for regular visitors. Pneumococcal vaccination for at-risk NH residents is proposed at admission. In our health care setting, both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were made by the same nurse after a physician had checked the absence of medical contraindications.",

Rapid tests have been developed for hMPV,38 although in France testing is not recommended for every resident of NHs. When investigating a respiratory outbreak in an NH, French national recommendations do not clearly define indications for RT-PCR tests. Nevertheless, in 2012 the French Public Health authority recommended the microbiological testing of an ARI if it was severe, had an unfavorable course, and/or concerned an outbreak in a nursing home. In the latter case, it is recommended to make 3 swabs. This recommendation was adhered to in the outbreak reported here. Partly to limit costs, residents who subsequently presented an ARI were considered as probable cases.",

During this outbreak, 10 health care workers developed a respiratory viral infection, of which 5 had received the annual influenza vaccination. Although no vaccination against hMPV currently exists, some organizational measures can be taken to prevent or contain outbreaks, such as reinforcing the nursing skills and better education of health care workers,39, 40 upgrading NH admission criteria for improved medical surveillance, and training in measures for infection control.41 Kossover et al41 showed some discrepancies in practices within the American facilities they studied. Harmonization may permit a better sharing of anti-infectious strategies, including the systematic use of masks by all health care workers and NH staff throughout this type of outbreak.",

To our knowledge, the outbreak reported here is 1 of the largest occurring in an NH, allowing us to attempt a more precise description of this infection in the institutionalized older adults with predominantly upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The major limitation was that because of public health policy, swabs for viral identification were not taken in every symptomatic case. Precautions to prevent transmission seem difficult to apply to this population and need to be improved. As a low ADL score has been shown to be associated with risk of infection, the care of older adults with infections should be approached through the prism of capacity trajectory. Interestingly, influenza vaccination appeared to be statistically associated with a higher risk of hMPV infection\u2014an observation that requires further investigation.",
