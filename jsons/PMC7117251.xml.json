            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, causes infections in pigs worldwide. The virus replicates highly in the respiratory tract and shows a distinct tropism for broncho-alveolar macrophages (Duan et al., 1997). However, a single PRRSV infection, particularly under experimental circumstances and with European isolates, fails to induce overt respiratory disease (Done and Paton, 1995). Also under field circumstances, most pigs become infected with PRRSV at growing age without respiratory disease. Still, the frequency and severity of respiratory disease have increased since the enzootic occurrence of PRRSV (Done and Paton, 1995). This has stimulated research into the combined effects of PRRSV and other infectious agents. Consequently, experimental dual infections have been performed with PRRSV followed by various bacteria such as Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Salmonella choleraesuis (Cooper et al., 1995, Galina et al., 1994, Brockmeier et al., 2000, Wills et al., 2000). We ourselves have performed dual infections with PRRSV followed by enzootic viruses, notably porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SIV) (Van Reeth et al., 1996). The clinical effects of these combinations were extremely severe in some cases, but almost completely subclinical in other. Most important, none of the dual infections mentioned provides a reliable model to study pathogenetic features or to test control measures. We hypothesized therefore that the clinical outcomes of dual inoculations with two infectious agents are influenced by factors that are too difficult to control, such as the stage of replication and the viral or bacterial load.",

            "text": "Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or endotoxins, a major constituent of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, are released in high concentrations in the lungs upon infection with gram-negative bacteria (Lamp et al., 1996, Kadurugamuwa and Beveridge, 1997) and these endotoxins are present in varying concentrations in dust in swine buildings (Rylander, 1994, Zejda et al., 1994). The release of LPS by gram-negative bacteria, such as H. parasuis, P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica, and S. choleraesuis may explain the more severe disease in the experimental dual infections with PRRSV and these bacteria (Cooper et al., 1995, Brockmeier et al., 2000, Wills et al., 2000). Van Reeth et al. (2000) recently demonstrated that dual inoculations with PRCV followed by bacterial LPS seriously aggravate respiratory signs in gnotobiotic pigs, while the respective single inoculations were subclinical. Therefore, we wanted to examine if exposure of PRRSV-infected pigs to LPS similarly enhances respiratory signs. PRRSV may lend itself excellently as a predisposing agent for synergism with LPS, because all pigs become infected at ages varying from 4 weeks to fattening age (Albina et al., 1994, Houben et al., 1995). Also, PRRSV persists in the lungs for 40 (Labarque et al., 2000) to 49 (Mengeling et al., 1995) days. We have examined the clinical course of inoculations with PRRSV followed by LPS, and the effect of the timing and frequency of LPS administrations. Additionally, some preliminary investigations of cellular and virological aspects in the lungs were performed.",

However, it has been most difficult to reproduce respiratory signs in experimental infection studies with PRRSV and a second infectious agent. The present PRRSV\u2013LPS combination induces clear respiratory signs in 87% of the pigs. Unlike in our previous studies with PRRSV\u2013SIV and PRRSV\u2013PRCV combinations (Van Reeth et al., 1996), mean clinical scores were higher than those of control pigs in every experiment. Only two out of the 15 PRRSV-infected pigs did not develop respiratory signs upon LPS exposure. It is important to mention, however, that individual variation in disease severity is unavoidable with respiratory pathogens. Such an individual variation has even been reported in experimental infection studies with primary respiratory pathogens such as Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Baarsch et al., 2000) or SIV (Van Reeth et al., 1998).",

The clinical effect of a second LPS administration was dependent on the time interval between the two LPS administrations. In non-infected pigs, a second LPS administration at a 24 h interval caused milder clinical signs than the first one. On the other hand, a second LPS administration within a 3 h interval seriously aggravated and prolonged general and respiratory signs. These observations suggest that two LPS administrations within a short time interval lead to an accumulation of LPS in the lungs. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the clinicopathological manifestations of LPS are strictly dose-dependent. For example, if sufficient amounts of LPS are given to animals and man, cytokine induction, lung inflammation and decreased lung function are observed. Slightly smaller LPS doses, on the other hand, will cause only a mild lung inflammation (Michel et al., 1997). In PRRSV-infected pigs, the clinical effect of a second LPS administration was difficult to assess since pigs had not yet recovered at the moment of the second LPS administration, 3 or 24 h after the first one. There is little information on the effect of repeated LPS administrations to farm animals in the literature. It appears logical, however, that the mediators or mechanisms responsible for the clinical effects of LPS may become exhausted if high LPS doses are administered frequently.",

Indeed, virus titres were similar in PRRSV\u2013LPS or singly PRRSV-inoculated pigs. Total BAL cell numbers and neutrophil infiltration were similar in PRRSV\u2013LPS or singly LPS exposed pigs. Also, the two PRRSV\u2013LPS exposed pigs, which remained healthy, had similar BAL cell profiles as their clinically affected group mates. This suggests that inflammatory changes in the lungs have little or no effect on the synergism between PRRSV and LPS. We hypothesize therefore that functional lung changes, such as bronchial hyper-responsiveness, are more important in the pathogenesis of PRRSV\u2013LPS induced disease than structural changes. Similar findings were made in a previous experimental infection study with PRCV followed by LPS (Van Reeth et al., 2000). In this study, disease development was tightly correlated with lung production of proinflammatory cytokines, among which tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to cause bronchial hyper-responsiveness in laboratory animal models (Kips et al., 1992, Thomas et al., 1995).",
