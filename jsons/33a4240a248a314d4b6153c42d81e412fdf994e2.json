            "text": "Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Aim: We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of presymptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.78-6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01-4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32-67) for Singapore and 62% (95% CrI: 50-76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information. Conclusion: High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.",

As at 22 April 2020, 2,573,143 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 185 countries and territories around the world [1] . In order to plan intervention strategies aimed at bringing disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 outbreak under control as well as to monitor disease outbreaks, public health officials depend on insights about key disease transmission parameters that are typically obtained from mathematical or statistical modelling. Examples of key parameters include the reproduction number (R) (average number of infections caused by an infectious individual), and distributions of the generation interval (time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair), serial interval (time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair) and incubation period (time between moment of infection and symptom onset) [2] . Estimates of the reproduction number together with the generation interval distribution can provide insight into the speed with which a disease will spread. On the other hand, estimates of the incubation period distribution can help guide determining appropriate quarantine periods.",

It has recently been shown that ignoring the difference between the serial and generation interval can lead to biased estimates of the reproduction number [8] . More specifically, when the serial interval distribution has larger variance than the generation interval distribution, using the serial interval as a proxy for the generation interval will lead to an underestimation of the effective reproduction number, R. When R is underestimated, this may lead to prevention policies that are insufficient to stop disease spread [8] .",

In 2012, Hens et al.

Te Beest et al. [11] used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as an alternative to the EM algorithm, to facilitate taking uncertainty related to the dates of symptom onset into account. In this paper, we use a MCMC approach to estimate, next to the serial interval distribution, the generation interval distribution upon specification of the incubation period distribution. We compare the impact of differences among previous estimates of the incubation period distribution for COVID-19.",

The first step updates the missing links v(i) missing and the second step updates the parameter vector \u0398 1 , i.e. the parameters of the generation interval distribution. We assume that both the generation interval and the incubation period are gamma distributed, i.e. f(x; \u0398 1 ) \u2261 \u0393(\u03b1 1 , \u03b2 1 ) and k(\u03b4; \u0398 2 ) \u2261 \u0393(\u03b1 2 , \u03b2 2 ). The parameter vector \u0398 2 is fixed to (\u03b1 2 = 3.45; \u03b2 2 = 0.66), corresponding to an incubation period with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 2.8 days [6] . Minimally informative uniform priors are assigned to the parameters of the generation interval distribution, i.e. \u03b1 1 ~ U(0,30) and \u03b2 1 ~ U(0,20). For cases with multiple potential infectors, the possible links v(i) missing are assigned equal prior probabilities. The missing links are updated using an independence sampler, whereas \u0398 1 is updated using a random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a uniform proposal distribution [13] . We evaluate the posterior distribution using 3,000,000 iterations of which the first 500,000 are discarded as burn-in. Thinning is applied by taking every 200th iteration. The mean and variance of the generation interval distribution are monitored within the MCMC chain. Posterior point estimates are given by the 50% percentiles of the converged MCMC chain. CrIs are given by the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the converged MCMC chain. The serial interval distribution is obtained by simulating 1,000,000 draws from h(z; \u0398 1 , \u0398 2 ).

Table 1 shows parameter estimates of the generation and serial interval distributions for each dataset, assuming an incubation period with a mean of 5.2 days and a SD of 2.8 days. The mean generation time is estimated to be 5.2 days (95% CI: 3.78-6.78) for the Singapore data, and 3.95 days (95% CI: 3.01-4.91) for the Tianjin data. As expected, the estimated means of the generation interval and serial interval distributions are approximately equal, but the latter has a larger variance. Table 2 shows parameter estimates of the generation and serial interval distributions for each dataset, assuming incubation periods with a mean of 6.4 and a SD of 2.3 days, or a mean of 4.8 and SD of 2.6 days. The parameter estimates are fairly robust to the specified incubation period distribution, with mean generation times of about 5 days for Singapore and 4 days for Tianjin. Table 3 shows parameter estimates of the generation and serial interval distributions obtained when allowing for negative serial intervals in case there is no known infector. Compared with baseline analyses ( Table 1) , estimates of the mean generation time are smaller when allowing for negative serial intervals. The mean generation time is 3.86 days for Singapore and 2.90 days for Tianjin. Table 4 shows parameter estimates obtained when we fit the model to data from the largest cluster (n = 45). We only show results for the Tianjin dataset because for the Singapore data, there were too few cases (n = 25) and the MCMC chain did not converge. When allowing only positive serial intervals for cases with no known infector, the mean generation time is estimated to be 3.50 days. On the other hand, when allowing for negative serial intervals, it is estimated to be 2.57 days. Table 5 shows the proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers for each dataset. Pre-symptomatic transmission is higher when allowing for negative serial intervals for cases with no known infector.

For the Tianjin data, the baseline estimate of the mean generation time (3.95 days) is about the same as when allowing serial intervals to be negative in the Singapore data. However, there were already some negative serial intervals among the reported links in the Tianjin data, which may explain this lower estimate. The difference in these estimates could also be the result of differences in containment strategies. When allowing for negative serial intervals in the Tianjin data, the mean generation time decreased to 2.90 days (95% CrI: 1.85-4.12).

When the incubation period is larger, it is expected that these proportions will be higher and when it is smaller, they are expected to be lower. Hence, a large proportion of transmission appears to occur before symptom onset, which is an important point to consider when planning intervention strategies. It is worth noting that the outbreak data we used were collected in the presence of intervention measures such as case isolation and quarantining of identified contacts. This means that our estimates do not necessarily reflect the natural epidemiology of COVID-19, but instead reflect what is observed in the presence of these intervention measures. It is expected that these measures reduce the proportion of symptomatic transmission, which implies that a high proportion of infections is likely to have occurred before symptom onset because isolation prevents symptomatic transmission.",

            "text": "Our study does have some limitations. First, we rely on previous estimates for the incubation period. However, our sensitivity analyses showed that changing the incubation period distribution does not have a big impact on our estimates of the generation interval distribution. Second, we do not account for incomplete or possible changes in reporting over the course of the epidemic. Incomplete reporting means that cases are missing, with this leading to incomplete transmission networks. As the underlying transmission network has a large impact on our estimates, incomplete reporting may bias our estimates. Third, we do not acknowledge changes in contact patterns and thus behavioural change, which could shape realised generation interval distributions as well as serial interval distributions (data not shown). Fourth, we do not account for contraction of the generation interval because of depletion of susceptibles. Future work should take these shortcomings into account.",

A variable that determines how effective these case-based measures are is the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission. Our estimates of this proportion are high, ranging from 48% to 77%. This implies that the effectiveness of case finding and contact tracing in preventing COVID-19 infections will be considerably smaller compared with the effectiveness in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, where pre-symptomatic transmission did not play an important role (see e.g [17] ). As has been shown by other studies, e.g Hellwell et al. [18] , it is unlikely that these measures alone will suffice to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Additional measures, such as physical distancing, are required and are already implemented in most countries.",
