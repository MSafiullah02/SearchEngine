COVID-19, the disease caused by this highly contagious virus, can have serious health consequences, though risks of complications are highly age-dependent. Rates of hospitalization and death are less than 0.1% in children, but increase to 10% or more in older people. Moreover, at all ages, men are more likely than women to suffer serious consequences from COVID-19. These patterns are familiar to the geroscience community. The effects of age and sex on mortality rates from COVID-19 mirror the effects of aging on almost all major causes of mortality. These similarities are explored here, and underscore the need to consider the role of basic biological mechanisms of aging on potential treatment and outcomes of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The geroscience concept holds that treatments that target the underlying molecular pathways of aging biology that shape this physiological decline could, in turn, decrease risk for many different age-related diseases and improve outcomes in those that succumb to disease (19, 20) . In light of the coronavirus pandemic, researchers have also suggested that putative 'geroprotective' treatments, such as rapamycin or senolytics, might be used to treat or prevent COVID-19 (21, 22) . For example, it would be of great interest to understand the role of widely-known agingrelated molecular pathways-mTOR signaling, IIS signaling, cell senescence-in the response to coronavirus infection and recovery from COVID-19. Geroscience has seen major strategic advances for the discovery of treatments to increase healthspan in laboratory organisms (23) , and there is some evidence for the efficacy of longevity-derived interventions in treating acute symptoms of age-related disease at least in the lab (24, 25) . There can be no doubt as to the interaction of aging biology and COVID-19 mortality, and its seems likely that a better understanding of this relationship would inform not only the biology of viral susceptibility and progression to life-threatening outcomes, but also how aging creates a pernicious environment that augments the negative consequence of viral load. For specific causes of mortality, MRDT 95% confidence intervals: all causes (8.6 -9.1); heart disease (6.4-7.6); malignant neoplasms (5.7 -7.0); COPD (4.5 -5.0); diabetes (6.7 -7.5); kidney disease (6.4 -6.7).
