In this paper, we show that a multiplex structure can greatly affect the spread of an epidemic driven by traffic dynamics. One of the interesting findings is that the multiplex structure could suppress the outbreak of an epidemic, which is different from the typical finding of spread dynamics in multiplex networks. In particular, one layer with dense connections can attract more traffic flow and eventually suppress the epidemic outbreak in other layers. Therefore, the epidemic threshold will be larger than the minimal threshold of the layers. With a mean-field approximation, we provide explicit expressions for the epidemic threshold and for the onset of suppressing epidemic spreading in multiplex networks. We also provide the probability of obtaining a multiplex configuration that suppresses the epidemic spreading when the multiplex is composed of: (i) two Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi layers and (ii) two scale-free layers. Therefore, compared to the situation of an isolated network in which a disease may be able to propagate, a larger epidemic threshold can be found in multiplex structures.",

Multiplex networks are proved to describe many real-life systems better, especially when these systems are composed of different but interconnected subnetworks [2] [3] [4] [5] . Representative examples include the traffic systems with multimodal transportation, and the social networks where individuals can use multiple platforms. In social networks, an individual can use different platforms to communicate with different categories of friends: kinship, vicinity, membership of the same society, colleague in a company, etc. In the spreading of information, people will first select the subgroup of friends that are thought to be interested and then forward the information to the subgroup.",

            "text": "Multimodal traffic systems can be also abstracted as traffic dynamics on top of a multiplex structure. In the system, each geographical location has different entry points for different transportation media. Traffic dynamics are usually modeled as the flow of elements from origin to destination nodes guided by routing paths [6, 7] . The routing strategy and network structure can greatly influence the emergence of congestion [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Many works have been devoted to extend the traffic and spreading dynamics on isolated networks to multiplex networks [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The multiplex structure has been proved to affect the transportation process, such as traffic load dis-* humaobin@ustc.edu.cn \u2020 minglichn@ustc.edu.cn tribution, and choice of origin and destination [15, [21] [22] [23] . For example, in the multimodal traffic system, each element can choose the most appropriate media to start and end its travel. If all elements adopt the shortest paths to minimize their travel distance, this \"selfish behavior\" will provoke an unbalance in the traffic load of the transportation layers and induce counterintuitive congestion [15, 23] .",

For convenience, we briefly review the main results of epidemic dynamics on networks. As epidemic dynamics is concerned, the structure of a network is vital to the outbreak of an epidemic [24] [25] [26] . One of the most important findings is the vanished epidemic threshold on scale-free (SF) networks [24, 25, 27] . The generalization of classical epidemic models [such as the susceptible-infected susceptible (SIS) and susceptibleinfected recovered] to the multiplex networks has stimulated a great interest. Obviously, one important issue is to relate the epidemic onset of the whole system with those corresponding to the isolated networks. Previous studies have pointed out that an epidemic can be induced in the multiplex system even for infection rates for which a disease would be unable to propagate in each isolated network [19, 20, 28] . That is, the critical epidemic point of the multiplex network is smaller than any of the isolated layers. The coupled system can sustain an epidemic even when the isolated networks would be free of disease.",

            "text": "However, in practice, the spreading of an epidemic is often accomplished with traffic dynamics, such as the outbreak of a virus in the Internet through data transmission, and the propagation of annual influenza by air travel [29, 30] . When the epidemic spreading is taking place in a traffic-driven environment, the situation will be more complex. In fact, the outbreak of such an epidemic is mainly dependent on the spreading scope, which is determined by traffic conditions FIG. 1. Schematic of the multiplex networks. Without loss of generality, here the multiplex network is assumed to be double layered, labeled A and B, respectively. For traffic dynamics, elements travel from the origins to the destinations following the shortest paths. For example, if an element travels from i to j, the shortest path is i A \u2192 j A with length 1. Since only layer A is used, this is an intralayer path. Another example, the path length is 3 from j to k, i.e., j A \u2192 i A \u2192 i B \u2192 k B . Obviously, this is an interlayer path. [27, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Due to the distribution of traffic flow among the layers, the relation of the epidemic onset of the whole system with those of the constituent layers is still unclear. In this paper, we study the traffic-driven epidemic problem with a traffic model similar to the multimodal traffic system [15] . By mean-field approximation, we obtain analytical expressions for the epidemic thresholds of the multiplex network. We show that the epidemic threshold of the multiplex network is not always smaller than those of the isolated networks. An appropriate structure of one layer will attract some traffic flow and suppress the epidemic spreading in the whole system. The suppression of an epidemic by a multiplex network will occur when the structure of constitutive layers meets some special requirements. The theoretical analysis provided in this paper can be applied to both homogeneous random multiplex networks and heterogeneous scale-free multiplex networks. The results reveal a profound relation between the outbreak of the epidemic and the multiplex structure.",

(13) is used to determine the regions where the multiplex suppresses the epidemic. One can see that the result of Eq. (13) shows the qualitative agreement with the experiments. The deviation is mainly caused by the mean-field approximation and the correlation of networks, especially when the average degrees of individual layers are large.",

The more efficient layer (in terms of the traffic flow) will attract some traffic flow from the less efficient layer, which is also more vulnerable in the epidemic spreading. When the structures of two layers are appropriate, this effect will eventually increase the epidemic threshold. However, for the region of comparatively different average degrees (upper and right edge), the probability of observing an epidemic suppressed by multiplex structure is very low. The reason of this phenomenon is also the redistribution of traffic flow among the layers. When one layer is far more efficient than the other layers, the traffic flow will immigrate to the layer, and eventually induce an epidemic outbreak in the layer.",

            "text": "In the previous subsection, we show that the spreading of a traffic-driven epidemic may be suppressed by a multiplex network composed of homogenous random graph layers. In fact, this phenomenon can be observed in other multiplex network structures. Here, we demonstrate the suppression of a traffic-driven epidemic on SF multiplex networks, which is more appropriate to represent real-life communication systems. We construct each layer by the uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) [37, 38] . The rules of the UCM proceed as follows: (1) In a set of N initially disconnected nodes, assign each node i a degree k i sampled from the power-law distribution P(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 with the constraints k min k i k max (normally k max = \u221a N); (2) randomly connect nodes by the preassigned degrees, and multiple and self-connections are forbidden. One can see that the parameters controlling the structure of the UCM SF networks are k min and \u03b3 . Here, we fix \u03b3 = 2.8, N = 1000, and adjust k min as a variable to control the layer structure. Furthermore, since the system used here is relatively small, the hubs could dominate the structure of the network as well as the distribution of the traffic load. So, we add a constraint k max = min(k min + 10, \u221a N ) to distinguish layers with different k min 's. With the increase in the system size, this constraint can be relaxed. However, that might be computationally expensive. Figure 5 shows the probability of observing an epidemic suppressed by the SF multiplex networks. The phenomenon of suppressing the epidemic in the multiplex networks is observed when both layers' minimal degrees are relatively small. When the minimal degree of any layer exceeds k min \u2248 22, the UCM model will make a node in the layer have the maximum degree of k max = \u221a N. Then, the traffic flow will be attracted to the layer, and the effect will eventually produce a lower epidemic threshold for the multiplex network. Equation (13) can work well in predicting the boundaries of regions. With SF networks, the approximation of \u03bb \u2248 1.0 is no longer valid. Therefore, the prediction of Eq. (13) with \u03bb = 1.0 is not presented.",

We also provide an explicit expression for determining the network parameters that trigger these phenomena. The theoretical predictions show a qualitative agreement with the empirical experiments.",
