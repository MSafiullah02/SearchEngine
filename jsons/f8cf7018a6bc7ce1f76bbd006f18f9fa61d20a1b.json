Single viral infections in both, March and October showed predominance of enterovirus (EV, 33.3% and 40%) and rotavirus A (RVA, 33.3% and 25%).

Mixed viral infections were largely represented by two viruses (84.6% and 88.9%), a small proportion showed presence of three (7.7% and 11%) and four (7.7% and 0%) viruses in the two outbreaks. Genotyping of the viruses revealed predominance of RVA G2P [4] , RVB G2 (Indian Bangladeshi lineage), NoV GII.4, AdV-40, HAstV-8 and AiV B types. VP1/2A junction region based genotyping showed presence of 11 different serotypes of EVs. Although no virus was detected in the tested water samples, examination of both water and sewage pipelines in gastroenteritis affected localities indicated leakages and possibility of contamination of drinking water with sewage water. Coexistence of multiple enteric viruses during the two outbreaks of gastroenteritis emphasizes the need to expand such investigations to other parts of India.",

RVBs are genetically and antigenically distinct from RVAs and have been found to infect humans and different species of animals.

However, Echo-11 identified in the gastroenteritis outbreak from Southern India [35] was not detected. The high prevalence and genetic diversity of EV strains noted in the present study are indicative of the association of EVs with acute gastroenteritis and suggest the need for surveillance of EV infections in India. AiVs have been described to be present in the mixed infections together with other enteric pathogens [40] . Interestingly, in this study, all four patients excreting AiV showed absence of other enteric viruses.",

Thus, sewage water is a good source of a variety of enteric viruses circulating in any region/community [40] . An accidental mixing of the sewage water with the drinking water supply provides an opportunity to multiple enteric viruses to infect humans simultaneously and cause disease outbreaks. In the present study, water samples tested negative for enteric viruses. However, contamination of drinking water was reflected by brown color and malodor noticed by the inhabitants prior to the occurrence of outbreak, thus indicating leakages in the pipelines. The information available from the affected localities indicated that the water supplying pipes were more than 100 years old and that unauthorized and unclaimed pipelines existed for water connection. Since the daily water supply in this area was intermittent, back siphoning of sewage water in the drinking water supplying pipes could not be ruled out. Subsequently, clusters of cases who developed diarrhea and/or vomiting were reported from a single locality in a short period representing rampant infections of gastroenteritis [43, 44] . These findings highlight the possible enhancing impact of the sewage contamination on the endemic transmission of prevalent and emerging strains of enteric viruses. Notably, majority of the viral agents (RVA, NoV, AdV, HAstV and EV) detected in the patients affected by outbreaks showed the presence of more than one genotype/serotype indicating diverse nature of enteric viral pathogens. Thus, this report provides strong evidence of the cocirculation of multiple enteric viruses in Mumbai, the biggest cosmopolitan city of India. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from India that documents coexistence of seven (RVA, RVB, NoV, AdV, HAstV, EV and AiV) important enteric viruses in the outbreak cases of acute gastroenteritis and emphasizes the need to investigate such outbreak cases in different parts of India to evaluate the health risk associated with enteric viral pathogens in Indian population.",

Virological examination of the faecal specimens from the outbreaks ascertained the predominance of RVAs and EVs in the study population. Therefore, intervention strategies need to be developed against these viral infections. Occurrence of two outbreaks within seven months period in the same region emphasizes the need for constant vigilance of water supply and drainage systems to reduce the risks of such incidences. Overall, the study ratifies the need for continuous surveillance of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Mumbai and also in other parts of India for identifying the prevalent and new enteric viruses.",
