The environment in which decisions are made is influenced heavily by the legacy of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission in the 1980s and hepatitis C (HCV) in the 1990s. A precautionary approach is taken in a situation of ongoing review of past actions. Such reviews are often critical of delayed and inadequate responses by national blood services.",

It is noteworthy that, at least in developed countries, the acknowledged major blood borne viruses shared a common epidemiology enabling the application of donor exclusion criteria based on sexual behaviour and other lifestyle risks. This along with the application of increasingly sensitive serological testing methods and in many countries the introduction of molecular based testing has significantly improved the overall safety of donated blood. Indeed by the end of the 20th Century the residual risk of transmission of viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B and C had become very small indeed with reported risks of less than 1 in 2 or more million for major viruses commonly quoted.",

In this context, careful management of the balance between safety and supply becomes very important.

Four serotypes of the virus have been reported. Immunity appears to be restricted to each individual serotype. There are currently few reports of transfusion transmitted dengue, these include case reports from Hong Kong in 2002 [5] and Singapore in 2009 [6]. Detection of cases attributable to transfusion will however be problematic in endemic countries during periods when large numbers of cases are occurring in the community.

Pandemic planning within blood services will need to address both of these issues. Pandemic influenza will also impact blood services in other ways. Staff sickness and restrictions on movement will potentially impact adversely on business continuity. Demand for blood products will also be affected. The blood service response to novel influenza H1N1 09 has been inconsistent. Some national blood services initially implemented travel\u2010based donor deferrals.
