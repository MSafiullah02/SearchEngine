            "text": "Existing studies commonly rely on national official reports to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on population health and human life. However, relying on national reports is problematic because classification and estimation of COVID-19 mortality are not consistent across countries. Likewise, delay coronavirus test results and shortage of testing kits can result in undercounting of coronavirus deaths. To overcome these problems, this study exploits all cause daily death registrations data provide by the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) from 1 st January to 4 th April 2020. This allows us to: 1) calculate excess mortality in 2020 compared to the years 2015 to 2019; and 2) estimate life expectancy on a seasonal and annual basis. We focus our analysis on Bergamo and Brescia, the two hardest hit provinces in Lombardy, northern Italy. Given the clustering nature of the epidemic, focusing on the areas with high concentration of severe illness and deaths allows us to capture the true impact of COVID-19 on mortality and life expectancy, which are likely to be underestimated in the national level data. We find that on the period 1 Jan to 4 April 2020, seasonal life expectancy in Bergamo reduced by around 8.1 and 6.5 years compared to 2019 for men and women respectively (4.5 and 3.4 years in Brescia). The drop in period life expectancy for 2020 may total up to 3 years in the case of men and 2 years in the case of women. Such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the Second World War. This study shows that, in the absence of public health interventions to reduce the spread of the virus, COVID-19 has set life expectancy in Bergamo and Brescia back to the Italian life expectancy of 15 years ago.",

Italy, the first country outside China to experience a large-scale health impact of COVID-19, imposed a (partial) nationwide lockdown since 9 March 2020. Whilst the Italian government was praised by WHO for an implementation of such a measure (never employed in modern democratic nations since WWII), given the evidence that the virus spread under-detected in the northern part of the country already since late January 2020, strict measures might have been imposed too late. As a consequence, the outbreak has put unprecedented strain on the Italian healthcare system, resulting in an exceptionally high number of coronavirus deaths, currently the second highest in the world after the US.",

In particular, Italy is shown to have the highest case fatality rate while Germany, Austria and Norway are among the countries the lowest rate (Global Health 5050 2020). Accordingly, the media has constantly trying to dig out the underlying reasons behind the country differentials in COVID-19 deaths. Comparing COVID-19 deaths across countries, however, is challenging for several reasons, ranging from disparities in testing coverage, the criterial for defining a COVID-19 death to practice in post-mortem examination (Garc\u00eda-Basteiro et al. 2020) . One way to overcome the inconsistency in the differences in measurement of incidence and fatality is to consider excess mortality. Data on weekly or daily excess deaths, for instance, would allow scientists to compare the observed deaths in 2020 with the mortality patterns typically observed in previous years (Leon et al. 2020) .",

Three main features characterise the present analysis. First, COVID-19 deaths are estimated using excess mortality measures rather than relying on the official report of the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19. This way the mortality estimation does not suffer from biases related to sampling in testing and reporting policies. Second, the analysis focusses specifically on Bergamo and Brescia, the two hardest hit provinces in Lombardy, northern Italy. The two provinces were sometimes compared to Wuhan given their position as epicentres of the outbreak, which experienced a rapid escalation in the number of infections resulting in an insufficiency of healthcare resources and intensive care units (Porcheddu et al. 2020 ).",

Therefore, the direct impact of COVID-19 on mortality and average life expectancy is likely to be felt at a sub-national level rather than in a whole country. Finally, at the moment of writing, the epidemics in Bergamo and Brescia appear now to have been contained given that the epidemic curve has presented a downward trend in the first wave of infections. The results presented here are thus based mainly on hard number observed in these regions rather than on some forms of simulations with underlying assumptions. Focusing on the areas where the outbreak appears to have slowed down allows us to capture a fuller picture of the impact of the virus on mortality and life expectancy. Hence, by using complete and reliable data on the number of deaths for the first largest-scale outbreak outside China, this paper provides the first unbiased account of the mortality impact of COVID-19 and its consequence on life expectancy.",

            "text": "This paper aims to provide the first evidence-based assessment of the human life consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic based on unbiased weekly death registrations data. In particular, the choice of using overall daily mortality rather than official COVID-19 figures is motivated by two major concerns. First, during the last couple of months it has become clear that there exists no uniform way of classifying COVID-19 death. There is a variation across countries in counting mortality \"from\" and mortality \"with\" COVID-19. Italy, for instance, include any persons who tested positive for the virus when they died in the official COVID-19 death toll statistics regardless of the pre-existing diseases that may have caused death (Onder et al. 2020) . Likewise, whilst countries like Belgium and France after 2 nd April 2020 include coronavirus deaths outside hospitals in its official daily report, countries like the UK, Italy or Spain do not. Some countries such as Belgium, the UK and the US record COVID-19 deaths also from suspected cases and do not require a positive laboratory diagnosis like in Germany and the Netherlands (Roser et al. 2020 ). In addition, when the epidemic worsens, the counting of fatalities becomes more difficult. People dying at home or in long-term care facilities might indeed not be tested at all simply because resource allocation prioritises emergency operations. Even within the same country, it is difficult to compare the number of cases and deaths in different regions given disparities in regional policies and testing strategies and capacities . Therefore, weekly death registrations data from all causes are more comparable across countries and regions (Leon et al. 2020) . This is important given the need to share generalisable information in order to track the progress of the epidemics, to guide the implementation of prevention and control measures as well as to plan when to relax social distancing measures.",

Since case-fatality rates are calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases, the absence of accurate estimation of the infection rates in a reference population makes the denominator in the CFR relies heavily on testing strategies and capacities . Although much of the attention from the media and WHO has been devoted to increasing the number of coronavirus testing to as many people as possible (WHO 2020), little has been said about a sampling strategy. The only possible way to obtain reliable information about infection rates is through selecting and testing a representative sample of the population (Galeotti and Surico 2020) , an approach only very few countries have actually implemented. Only recently in April 2020, Iceland and Austria were the first countries to carry out a random-population screening test. This is understandable, since testing has been used as a measure of containment through isolating infected patients (together with tracing). However, testing only suspected cases implies a selection bias in a sampling approach which fails to provide unbiased estimates of infection rates in a population, no matter how many tests a country runs. The figures on infection rates based on unrepresentative sample testing thus are likely to be misestimation of the true prevalence.",

Due to the clustering nature of the virus outbreak, an analysis at the national level would underestimate the scale of the impact of COVID-19 on mortality and life expectancy. With a total population of approximately 2.3 million in the two provinces, a large-scale excess mortality can indeed affect life expectancy of a population in these small areas. In addition, the containment measures through lockdown were introduced too late given that the virus had already been circulated undetected in the region as early as in January 2020 (L'Eco di Bergamo 2020; Reuters 2020). This allows the epidemic to develop in its \"purest\" form, showing the potential impact of the virus in absence of any intervention measures to reduce its spread. Hence, when indicators like life expectancy are calculated, the reference population should naturally be the one experiencing the consequences of the epidemic. On the contrary, if the national data are considered and the outbreaks have been contained, the negative impact of the epidemic on potential years of life loss might end up being heavily underestimated.",

Indeed, later studies have shown that COVID-19 was present in the Lombardy region since the first half of January 2020 (Cereda et al. 2020 ; L'Eco di Bergamo 2020; Reuters 2020). The area around Codogno was immediately declared a \"red zone\" and a complete lockdown was enforced in 11 municipalities, while universities and schools in Lombardy were immediately closed. The region was about to enter what is probably the most serious public health and economic crisis after-WWII period. However, in the ten days following the presence of patient one, the nature of the epidemic was downplayed by most media and authorities, including some health experts. Testing strategies changed in due course, with only patients showing a combination of symptoms being tested. Lockdowns were gradually and slowly introduced only when it became clear that important outbreaks were on the way. On 8 March 2020 the whole Lombardy was declared \"orange zones\", just one day before the rest of Italy. Non-essential activities were however stopped only on 23 rd March 2020.",

Bergamo has been the first and hardest hit province in Lombardy. By 14 march 2020, all beds in intensive care units (ICUs) of the main hospital of the city were already filled.

For this purpose, we calculate seasonal age-specific mortality rates for each year. The numerators (i.e. the death counts) are recorded daily. Thus, aggregation over the period 1 st January and 4 th April at the provincial level is straightforward. The corresponding exposures (i.e., the denominators) were estimated as follows. Starting from the estimated resident population on 1 st January in 2020, we counted age-specific person-days up to 4 th April. Theoretically, these counts are a function of four demographic events, namely births, ageing, migration, and dying. The daily inflow of births is estimated by using monthly birth data and assuming that these births are uniformly distributed over each month. The effect of ageing, i.e. individuals might transition in-and out of a given age interval, is modeled by giving each individual the probability of 1/365 for turning one year older during the observation period. The outflows due to deaths are straightforward as age-specific death counts are known on a daily basis. We neglect migration because the population under study is quarantined. In sum, the exposed population at day t in age group x is given by the population alive at day t-1 in age group x plus those who age into age group x at day t minus those who either die in age group x or age out of the age group x in day t. We express the obtained daily exposure values in terms of person-years by multiplying them by 1/365 (1/366 for leap years). Then, we derive age-specific mortality rates for the period 1 st January to 4 th April. Finally, life tables are built following standard procedures outlined by the Human Mortality Database protocol. We estimate confidence intervals for life expectancies by bootstrapping using Monte Carlo simulation methods, assuming death counts follow a binomial distribution (Andreev and Shkolnikov 2010; Chiang 1984) . Further, the method proposed by Arriaga (1984) allows for decomposing changes in life expectancy into agespecific contributions. We applied this approach in order to assess, which age-groups have primary contributed to the change in seasonal life expectancy between 2019 and 2020.",

This scenario is probably not a very likely one, but it represents a clearly defined upper bound for life expectancy in 2020. In other scenario, harvesting is set to zero and we assume that after the end of the epidemic, mortality rates will go back to the average levels recorded in the previous years. There are good reasons to assume that mortality will not reduce substantially after the end of the first wave of COVID-19 infections. For example, because of most of the resources and health services have been directed to COVID-19 patients, people with other medical conditions such as cancer were under-treated. Likewise, although most vulnerable people have been doing self-isolation and locking themselves inside, it is highly possible that they would get the virus later after restriction measures are lifted. As a matter of fact, mortality after the epidemic wave might actually increase, especially among the working age population, as a consequence of the lockdowns and the likely economic recessions as has been observed, for example, in Greece (Laliotis et al. 2016 ). However, for this paper, we are not making assumptions on the indirect impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mortality after the epidemic ends. Therefore, if anything, years of life lost due to COVID-19 for the year 2020 may in fact be underestimated.",

To estimate life expectancy for the entire 2020, we need to project the evolution of deaths after 4 th April. We use cubic spline extrapolation to project the number of daily deaths in each age class from 4 th April until 30 th April. After 30 th April, we project mortality until the end of the year based on two scenarios. In the \"conservative\" scenario, we assume that after the end of the COVID-19 epidemics, deaths in each age class will occur such that the total number of deaths in 2020 equals the total number of deaths registered in 2017 2 . If the cumulative number of deaths by the end of the epidemics in any age class exceeds the total number of deaths registered in 2017, we assume zero deaths will occur after the end of the epidemics in that age class. In the \"business as usual\" scenario, we assume that mortality will return to the average levels recorded in 2015-2017. These are the most recent years for which data on annual death counts are available. Thus, it is possible to derive the number of deaths occurring after 30 th April as the difference between the annual death counts and deaths registered up to 30 th April for the years 2015-2017. As we do not know the daily distribution of deaths after 30 th , we make two assumptions. For age groups <50, we assume that deaths occur uniformly over the period 1 st May -31 st December 2020. For age groups \u226550, we assume that deaths between May and December 2020 occur following the 2015-2019 average distribution of monthly deaths.

Still, in the first quarter of 2020, in Bergamo the 80-89 mortality increased by 350% for males and 250% for females. Similar figures are observed for the 90+ and for the 70-79.

In Brescia, the number and the relative increase in mortality for the 70+ are lower than in Bergamo, with female and male mortality increasing in 2020 roughly by 190% and 220% respectively. However, a much higher than expected number of under 40, both males (1300%) and females (infinite increase) died in Brescia municipalities. Figure 2 shows trends in daily mortality within each of the two provinces from raw data. It is evident how the epidemic curve inflates with age and how this age effect is particularly remarkable for Bergamo. It is also clear that our last day of observation is already on a downward pattern of daily mortality. Indeed, on the 4th of April the epidemic wave was already towards the end in both provinces. This allows us to rely on hard data for the most part of the infection wave, reducing our reliance on modelling in the estimation of the total number of deaths related to this first wave of infection.",

Second, gender disparities in the percentages distribution of deaths are not as large (56% deaths involve male subjects) as reported for the whole nation of Italy (65%). However, this figure is misleading: the risk of dying for a male is between 1.5 to 3.5 higher than that for a female, depending on the age class and the province considered. Men are thus more at risk of mortality, but since COVID-19 affects the elderly the most and women are overrepresented among those aged 70+, absolute figures show a high number of deaths also among the females.

One good feature of the life expectancy indicator is that it provides a historical perspective over the human consequence of relevant shocks (Ghislandi et al. 2019 ). Looking at Figure A3 in the Appendix, it appears evident that such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the Second World War. In terms of the pandemic impact on years of life lost, we are observing a large-scale loss in life expectancy second only to the Spanish flu in 1918, where, according to Figure A3 , life expectancy for Italy dropped by more than 15 years. For the USA, Noymer and Garenne (2000) estimate reduction in life expectancy of 11.8 years. The differences between the COVID-19 pandemic and the 1918 flu pandemic are very distinct. First of all, the Spanish flue typically killed the young, which of course, all else equal, reduces life expectancy much more. Second, the outbreak of the Spanish flu occurred at the same time as the First World War when no public health and preventive measures were implemented. Finally, the medical technology and knowledge was much less advanced, with penicillin and other crucial pharmaceutical products not yet being available. It thus can be said that the years of life lost in Bergamo and Brescia, although not at the level achieved after the Spanish flu, are of a substantial scale given a much more advanced medical technology and the absence of war in the present day.",

This study does not represent the experiences of Italy and Lombardy region but also by choice, we intend to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on human life in the areas where little containment interventions were put in place. From the point of view of the timing, we have enough information to actually picture the entire evolution of the epidemic wave. However, when it comes to life expectancy for the year 2020, we need to rely on harvesting assumptions and we exclude the possible negative impact of the present and future lockdown policies and global economic recessions on health and human life.",

Indeed, the present analysis represents the first attempt to provide an evidence-based assessment of the human life impact of a frontline COVID-19 outbreak. In doing so, we raise a warning for the scientific and public health community around the world: the epidemic, when undetected and not contained, can easily get out of control and cause relevant social and human consequences. In defining the lockdown strategies governments should balance the costs of limiting social and economic activities with the human costs of possible epidemic waves. Vulnerable populations should be protected with a particular attention and constant monitoring of the epidemic progression. This should be given a priority in order not to get caught by surprise by devastating epidemic waves like the ones experienced in Bergamo and Brescia.",

So many years of life lost due to COVID-19 pandemic is worrying since it sets the affected areas back to their level of human development 20 years ago. As shown in the case of Bergamo and Brescia, the cost of human life from a delay in public interventions to reduce the virus transmission is disturbingly high. Amidst countries' preparation to ease the lockdown restrictions and social distancing measures, it is important to keep in mind the conceivable risk of viral reintroduction and a potential direct and indirect cost it can pose on human life. Well-planned government measures to prevent a second wave of infections along with public collaboration in keeping physical distancing and practicing proper hygiene until a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is available are key to achieve a balance between health and economic protection.",
