Recent emergence of newer pandemics e.g. H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and Zika virus etc. are also a major threat to public health [1], [2]. All these emerging viruses have more or less RNA genomes and as a result are capable of rapid mutation and resistance to the clinically available antiviral drugs. Thus threat of resistance poses major challenges in clinical management of these viral infections [3]. However, the field of antiviral drug discovery has witnessed a steady flow of exciting developments since the advent of nucleoside analogue acyclovir in 1960 [4]. Subsequently, more than 60 antiviral drugs of diverse chemical classes have been approved by the FDA, mainly for the management of HIV, herpes, the hepatitis B and C, and influenza A and B viruses and still many molecules are in various stages of clinical trials. Despite of these progress in the development of antiviral agents in recent years, there is still a pressing need for newer drugs acting through different mechanism to combat the problem of viral resistance as viruses are constantly evolving and have been developing new ways to evade the drugs [5]. Moreover, all of these render the search of antiviral therapy indistinct since it is difficult to identify unique biochemical features of viruses that may be appropriate for selective attack without harming the host cells [6].",

Coumarins have gained momentous attention in the last three decades as a lead structures for the discovery of orally bioavailable non-peptidic antiviral agents. Several of natural, semisynthetic, synthetic lead molecules bearing coumarin scaffold have been discovered in the recent past and are in various phase of drug development [9]. Although some erstwhile reviews have already been published, but all of them have specifically focused on the anti-HIV potential of coumarins derivatives [10], [11].

A number of virus-specific proteins or processes have been identified as targets for chemotherapeutic intervention [12]. Most of the antiviral drugs block intracellular events affecting the synthesis and dynamics of viral proteins and nucleic acids and amongst these, viral polymerases constitute the major target for many antiviral drugs [13]. Viral replication cycle generally consists of virus adsorption, virus-cell fusion, reverse transcription, integration, translation, proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, assembly, or release. All these steps could be envisaged as targets for chemotherapeutic intervention [14]. In addition to these virus-specific events, there are a number of host enzymes and processes that are innately involved with viral DNA, RNA, and glycoprotein syntheses. Also, these processes [i.e., inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase for RNA viruses, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase for Ebola, orotidine 5\u2032-monophosphate decarboxylase, CTP synthetase, glycosylation pathways, etc.] may be considered as targets for antiviral agents. The other strategies involve HIV reverse transcriptase, herpes viral DNA polymerase, HIV adsorption inhibitors as vaginal microbicides in the prevention of AIDS, inhibition of HIV-cell fusion through their interaction with the viral gp41, HIV nucleocapsid p7 zinc finger-binding, HIV integrase inhibition, viral (HIV, HSV, CMV, HCV, etc.) protease inhibition, HIV-1 Vpr inhibition, picorna viral capsid binders, influenza A virus uncoating inhibition, HIV Tat and Rev antagonism, HIV and HBV glycosylation inhibition, and influenza A and B virus neuraminidase inhibition [15], [16].",

            "text": "Previously, more or less all the clinically available HIV protease inhibitors are pepetidomimetics. Although these peptide-based inhibitors have got the edge over other inhibitors because of their very high binding affinity, but generally lacking the bioavailability requirements essential for cellular and oral activity and metabolic instability. This led to the search for inhibitors containing non-peptidic templates that might offer superior biopharmaceutical properties. 4-hydroxycoumarins (4-HCs) as non-peptidic HIV protease inhibitors have received considerable attention in the 90s, owing to their low molecular weight, high oral bioavailability, low clearance and more importantly, these are already being in use as therapeutic agents in human. Warfarin (1) is a 4-HC analogue, which is clinically available drug used in the prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. It acts by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent conversion of prothrombin into an active form thrombin, which is a serine protease enzyme catalysing many other coagulation-related reactions [17]. Moreover, several studies demonstrate that the protease is also an essential viral enzyme and an attractive target for anti-HIV drugs [18]. Prompted by these correlations, Bourinbaiar and his colleagues pioneered the study of testing the effects of the oral anticoagulant, warfarin, on viral replications and spread. Remarkably, they found that the low doses of warfarin (10\u22129 to 10\u22128 M) effectively inhibited the 50% HIV infections [19]. This discovery of 4-HC as a lead compound having promising anti-protease activity pave the way for the development of a new class of non-peptidic oral anti-viral agents. In pursuit of this goal, the Upjohn laboratory scientists Thaisrivongs et al. evaluated some similar coumarin derivatives as potential HIV-protease inhibitors using fluorescence based high-throughput screening. Surprisingly, an another coumarin based anticoagulant phenprocoumon (2) emerged as a novel lead template possessing weak HIV protease inhibitory activity (Ki = 1 \u03bcM) with antiviral ED50 of 100\u2013300 \u03bcM but having superior pharmacokinetics (Fig. 2\n). Protein crystallography of 2 in complex with HIV-1 protease was successfully carried out in order to get a clear insight of interactions and lead optimization. This crystal structure revealed that the 4-HC scaffold binds in a mode very similar to that of peptide inhibitors at the catalytic site, with the C-4 hydroxyl forming two hydrogen-bonds with aspartic residues (Asp25A and Asp25B) and lactone group forming two hydrogen bonds with isoleucine residues (Ile50A and Ile50B) (Fig. 3\n). This study led to the postulation of 4-HC as an essential pharmacophoric element which formed the basis of ensuing structure based drug design of more active analogues.",

Based on these approach Thaisrivongs and co-workers (Upjohn Lab.) did an extensive research and examined the crystal structure of 4-HC analogues bound to HIV protease superimposed along with previously reported peptide-based inhibitors (4). The relative positioning of peptidic and non-peptidic compounds in HIV-protease revealed that addition of amide chain at the meta position of the phenyl ring of 4-HC could improve the binding affinity of coumarin-based inhibitors. This design strategy resulted into an exciting series of a several promising amino acid and non-amino acid residue containing 4-HCs (5\u201310) with improved enzyme-binding affinity. These study revealed that, in addition to the essential pharmacophore 4-HC, 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrones incorporated side chains at the C-6 position are also suitably accommodated into the S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 subsites of the enzyme active site. Thus, previously reported compound 3 also provided a basis for possible further modification of these series into potent 2-pyrone analogues. Consequently, pyrone compound containing L-histidyl amino acid residue (11), was found to be most potent analogue of the series having Ki = 4 nM. Further resolution of its four specific diastereomers had no significant impact on enzyme-binding affinity which clearly indicates their insignificant stereochemical preferences. Cell culture assay proved the compound as a nontoxic (TD50 = >>30 \u03bcM) with antiviral potency of IC50 value 3\u20136 \u03bcM, which is comparable to that previously reported for the inhibitor 3 (Fig. 5\n) [21]. Replacement of ethyl group by cyclopropyl group at C-3\u03b1 position has also resulted in compounds 12\u201315 with improved efficacies. The general SAR of the series has been illustrated in Fig. 6\n.",

            "text": "Romines et al. at the Upjohn laboratories demonstrated a unique strategy for the enhancement secondary binding of 4-HC inhibitors to the protease enzyme. Instead of pursuing 4-hydroxy-2-pyrones they explored an alternate strategy for increasing the flexibility by replacing the benzene ring of 4-HC with saturated cycloalkyl rings i.e. cyclopentylpyranone (16) and cyclooctylpyranone (17) (Fig. 7\n). The results were surprising and cyclopropyl containing cyclooctylpyranone (18) emerged as a potential protease enzyme inhibitor having good pharmacokinetics but relatively very low activity in cell culture (IC50 = 57 \u03bcM). The size variation of cycloalkyl ring also provided some interesting information about the binding mode of conformationally-flexible cyclooctyl ring on the inhibitors [22]. Further, they also designed some meta substituted carboxamide derivatives (19 and 20) which were significantly more active than the corresponding unsubstituted cyclooctylpyranone due to its additional hydrogen bonding by the amide group [23]. Substitution of cyclooctylpyranones with a wide variety of arenesulfonamides led to analogues with markedly enhanced antiviral activity. Especially p-cyanophenyl sulphonamide derivative (U-103017) (21) was found to be potent (Ki = 0.8 nM, IC50 = 1.5 \u03bcM). Resolution via chiral HPLC yielded more potent enantiomer having a Ki = 0.6 nM and an antiviral IC50 = 1 \u03bcM. Oral bioavailability of this compound ranged from 42% (rat) to 77% (dog) with t1/2 = 6 h [24], [25]. Saturation of the 5,6-double bond in the pyrone ring led to the identification of a cycloalkyldihydropyrone derivative (22) with superb binding affinity for the HIV protease (Ki values in the 0.05 nM) and excellent antiviral activity in cell culture, with significantly less ED50 value of 0.95 \u03bcM [26]. Unfortunately, all the previous agents (U-96988 and U-103017) had failed in the early 1990s, but Pharmacia & Upjohn (now Pfizer) was again successful in generating buzz in June of 1999 when they reported the promising results of its new compound tipranavir (PNU-140690) (23), a potent orally bioavailable HIV-1 protease analogue of the 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrones sulfonamide class (Ki = 8 pM) effective against the 96 out of 107 highly resistant strains [27]. Later in the year 2000, Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) acquired the exclusive rights to tipranavir (Aptivus\u00ae) and subsequently, it was approved by the US FDA in 2005.",

They screened the Parke-Davis compound library using a high through-put assay and identified phenoxypropyl derivatives of 4-HC (PD099560) (24) and phenylthio derivative of 4-hydroxypyrone (25) as reversible competitive inhibitors effective at micro molar level. These two derivatives were excellent lead molecules in the development of therapeutically effective HIV-1 protease inhibitors, since they are small achiral nonpeptide molecules which can be easily synthesized and possessed promising pharmacological properties [28]. Binding mode of the compounds were studied employing a Monte Carlo-based docking procedure and X-ray crystal analysis. Subsequently, several analogues were prepared to test the binding interactions and improve the overall binding affinity. Amongst all, 4,7-dihydroxy-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)butyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (26) emerged as the most active compound having IC50 0.52 \u03bcM. Further optimization of pyrone derivative yielded several potent analogues (27\u201332) having several fold higher binding affinity among which PD-178390 (31) EC50 of 200 nM) was selected for further preclinical evaluation [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Unfortunately, no further clinical progress of this compound has been reported, probably as a consequence of the merging of the company with Pfizer. Parke-Davis laboratories also identified a dimethyl derivative of warfarin (32) which was nine-fold more potent than the parent compound (IC50 value 1.9 \u03bc M) but later they did not pursue warfarin analogues (Fig. 8\n) [35].",

The pharmacophore query used in the search was derived directly from the X-ray crystallography structures of protease-inhibitor complexes. Results of the in-vitro HIV protease bioassay evaluations clearly suggested that, while compounds containing a single 4-HC moiety are capable of binding to HIV-1 protease, compounds such as NSC 32180 (33) (ID50 0.32 \u03bcM) and 158393 (40) (ID50 1.7 \u03bcM, IC50 11.5 \u03bcM), which contain a \u201cdimer\u201d or \u201ctetramer\u201d of 4-HC, may be superior leads for further development. Compound NSC 158393 was also found to be an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). This compound therefore represents a multi-target lead for the development of potential anti-AIDS drugs. Based on their structural studies, they also proposed a pharmacophore essential for the HIV protease activity [36]. Further optimization of lead molecule NSC 158393 into structurally simpler coumarin derivatives through fragmentation of tetramer revealed that a coumarin dimer containing an arylmethylene (41) is an essential HIV Integrase pharmacophore [37]. Indeed, it turned out that modification of central phenyl ring with more lipophilic extended aromatic systems and addition of 7-hydroxy substituents to the coumarin rings (42) significantly enhanced its potency [38].",

The results demonstrated that any hydroxyl group nearer to the 4-hydroxyl group interfere with the hydrogen bond between this group and Asp25/Asp25\u2032 of HIV-1 protease however, distant 7-hydroxy derivatives were most active anti-HIV agents. Replacement of 3-phenyl with benzyl group indicates that flexibility did not lead to any significant change in activity [39]. Similarly, another scientist Stanchev et al. also reported some 4-HC derivatives as HIV-1 protease inhibitors. All these compounds were tested for anti-HIV-1 protease activity in MT4 cells infected by HIV-1. The highest inhibition of HIV-1 PR (25%) and highest MT4 cell survival (78%) were demonstrated by compound containing m-nitrophenyl derivative (44) (Fig. 10\n) [40].",

The structures of suksdorin and related coumarin derivative pteryxin (46) was previously established by Willetti et al. [42]. Suksdorfin was found to inhibit HIV-1 replication in H9 lymphocytes with an in vitro EC50 value of 2.26 \u03bcM and a therapeutic index value of 30.6. They observed that varying the acyl groups at 3\u2032 and 4\u2032 positions of pyran ring greatly affect the anti-HIV potency of unsubstituted analogue seselin (47). This led to discovery of first synthetic lead compound 3\u2032,4\u2032-di-O-(\u2212)-camphanoyl-(3\u2032R,4\u2032R)-(+)-cis-khellactone (DCK, 48), showing extremely potent inhibitory activity (EC50) 2.56 \u00b1 10\u22124 \u03bcM) against HIV-1 replication in the H9 cell line and had a remarkable therapeutic index (TI = 136719) however, its other diastereoisomers were 10000 times less active [43]. Enthused by their promising early findings, Lee et al. reported numerous DCK analogues and its thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) which demonstrates that, 3\u2032R,4\u2032R configurations and planarity of the coumarin ring system are essential structural features for anti-HIV activity; alkyl/O-alkyl substituents at the 3-, 4-, and 5-positions on the coumarin are favourable for enhanced anti-HIV activity and decreased toxicity of DCK [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. However, development of DCK-analogues as effective anti-AIDS drugs has been hindered by problems of their low water solubility hence less bioavailability and their ineffectiveness against multidrug resistant HIV strains (RTMDR). Therefore, in furtherance to the development of DCK-related clinical drug candidates (49\u201351) they identified hydroxymethyl derivative of DCK (49) as first moderate orally bioavailable drug (water soluble, F = 15%) which acts inhibiting the production of double-stranded viral DNA from the single-stranded DNA intermediate [49]. Moreover, ring opened DCK analogues or seco-DCK (52) which contains lesser hydrogen bond acceptor also showed improvement in ADME properties and found to be effective against RTMDR strains [50]. Isomeric replacement of coumarin with chromone resulted in DCP analogues (53) which are potent anti-HIV agents against the resistant strains RTMDR [51]. Seco-DCP (54) and extended conjugated xanthenone analogues (55) were also turned out to be promising against these untreatable resistant strains (Fig. 11\n) [52], [53].",

            "text": "The discovery and development of the anti-HIV compounds calanolide A and its analogues is an interesting account of lead identification that brought a promising drug candidate to patients with HIV while addressing the challenging issue of drug resistance. In 1992, Kashman and co-workers at the NCI laboratory discovered a new class of coumarin derivatives known as calanolide from the tropical rainforest tree, Calophyllum lanigerum as anti-HIV chemotype. Calanolides (A, B and C) (56\u201358) are chemically tetracyclic dipyranocoumarins having three chiral carbon centres in the scaffold at the C-10, -11, and -12 positions. Studies with purified bacterial recombinant reverse transcriptases (RT) revealed that these calanolides are HIV-1 specific RT inhibitors active against both AZT-resistant G-9106 and pyridinone-resistant A17 strain. A 5-fold reduction in activity was observed for the 12-keto analogue 59 which contains one lesser chiral centre. Thus calanolides represent a substantial departure from the known class and therefore provide a novel new anti-HIV chemotype for drug development [54]. Because of their limited availability from natural resources, the total synthesis and racemic resolution of calanolides has been carried out. After bioassay, only (+)-calanolide A (NSC-675451) accounted for the anti-HIV activity, however its (\u2212)- isomer was inactive [55]. Related novel RT inhibitors inophyllums A (60), B (61), C, E and P (62) were isolated from the fractions of Calophyllum inophyllum Linn. (Malaysian indigenous) [56] and cordatolide A (63) and B (64) were isolated from Calophyllum cordato-oblongum (a Srilankan indigenous) [57]. Prompted by these results, a number of closely related pyranocoumarins have been reported afterwards in different Calophyllum species and their semi-/synthetic derivatives (65\u201368) were also designed as potent anti-HIV agents [58], [59], [60]. Currently, (+)-calanolide A (56) (Sponsor: Sarawak MediChem Pharmaceuticals) has completed phase I/II 48-subject clinical trial as combination therapy for HIV (Fig. 12\n). The oral toxicity of the drug was minimal and reported adverse effects were dizziness, nausea, oily aftertaste.",

Imperatronin inhibited HIV replication in H9 lymphocytes with EC50 values of <0.10 mg/ml, and it inhibited uninfected H9 cell growth with IC50 values of >100 mg/ml, calculated therapeutic index (TI) value of >1000. Further studies on its mechanism of action revealed that unlike the other coumarins, imperatronin did not inhibit the reverse transcription nor the integrase but inhibit the Sp1-related genes (D1 expression) thereby arresting the cells at the G(1) phase of cell cycle. These results highlight the potential of SP1 transcription factor as a target of natural anti-HIV compounds, such as furancoumarins that might have potential therapeutic role in the management of AIDS [63].",

These compounds did not show any suppressive effect on the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, suggesting that they act specifically on the HIV promoter. These results suggest that 3-phenylcoumarin derivatives might be potential candidate for developing novel anti-HIV drugs targeting at HIV promoter activity [64]. Encouraged by these observations, Olmedo et al. synthesized different 3-phenylcoumarin derivatives and evaluated their anti-HIV activity. The sulfanylphenylcoumarin derivative (80) emerged as the most potent inhibitor of HIV replication acting through dual inhibition of NF-\u03baB and unspecific Tat functions whereas, 4-hydroxy derivative (81) (umbelliferone derivative), acts through specific Tat inhibitory activity. All the synthetic coumarins were more potent than mesuol against both NF-\u03baB and Tat molecular targets but less effective in the RV assay. Thus, the presence of prenyl or prenacyl substituents attached to coumarin nucleus could be prerequisite structural factor reinforcing the antiviral activity (Fig. 14\n) [65].",

Detailed SAR and minimal pharmacophore responsible for Vpr inhibitory activity has also been explored. Binding assay of Vpr mutants revealed that the hydrophobic region about residues Glu-25 and Gln-65 are potentially involved in the binding of the inhibitor.

It inhibited HIV replication in H9 lymphocyte cells with ED50 values of 2.51 \u03bcg/mL and therapeutic index of 11.2 (Fig. 18\n) [73].",

            "text": "Viral hepatitis is a potentially serious infectious disease mainly affecting liver causing hepatocellular carcinoma and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, recent research efforts have been more focusing on development of antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies against these viruses. Several coumarins analogues also proved to have a substantial anti-hepatitis virus activity. Recently a new compound library of hybrid coumarin-benzimidazole derivatives connected through methylenethio linker (\u2014SCH2\n\u2014) as anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents were reported by Hwu et al. These conjugates exhibited very appealing anti-HCV activity and become promising leads in the further development of assortment of hybrid molecules. Preliminary antiviral activity against the Huh 5\u20132 replicon system demonstrated that compound containing 6-bromocoumarin (94) exhibit potent inhibitory effect with EC50 value of 3.4 \u03bcM. From the results of anti-HCV activity, it was anticipated that the substitution of coumarin at 6th position with lipophilic electron withdrawing atom bromine is essential for maintaining the anti-HCV activity. Glucosidation of these compounds by linking \u03b2-d-glucose peracetate have also resulted in further 4.8-fold increase in anti-HCV activity and 6-bromocoumarin glucopyranose derivative (95) emerged as a potent antiviral agent (EC50 = 4.1 \u03bcM) inhibiting HCV RNA replication by 90% and had no effect on cell proliferation. These data in the new compound library provided clues for the development of several coumarin-benzimidazole related conjugates as anti-HCV agents [74]. Subsequent modifications of benzimidazole nucleus into heterobicycles; imidazopyridine, purine, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole were also carried out to establish the structure-activity relationship (SAR) on the basis of new compounds library. Most promising compounds were imidazopyridine-coumarin (96), purine-coumarin (97), and benzoxazole-coumarin (98), which inhibited HCV replication at an EC50 of 6.8, 2.0, and 12 \u03bcM, respectively [75]. However, the benzothiazolyl-coumarin analogue (99) was least effective against the HCV. These encouraging results of purine-coumarin conjugates pave the way for the development of corresponding ribonucleoside-coumarin analogues. Seven among the 26 new compounds were found to inhibit HCV subgenomic replicon replication in the Huh 5\u20132 cell line. Amongst these purine analogues, 8-(Coumarin-3\u2032-yl)methylthio-9-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranos-1\u2033-yl)-purine (100) showed potent activity with EC50 value of 2.0 \u03bcM [76]. In another series, the benzimidazole ring was replaced by imidazole ring to further explore the SAR of imidazole\u2013coumarin conjugates (101). It was observed that unsubstituted imidazole (i.e. hydrogen atom at the N1 position) and Cl, F, Br, Me, and OMe substitution at the coumarin nucleus resulted into compounds having significant activity [77]. Removal of methylenethio linker between the benzimidazole and coumarin afforded directly hinged coumarin-benzimidazole derivatives as potent anti-HCV agents. The dimethylimidazole-coumarin (102) and methylimidazole-benzocoumarin (103) exhibited promising EC50 values of as low as 3.0 and 5.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Further incorporation of a d-ribofuranose afforded corresponding nucleoside (104) with slight abatement in activity [78]. Thus, all these detailed studies underline the significant potential of coumarin-benzimidazole conjugates as a lead compound for the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of HCV (Fig. 19\n).",

A novel angelicin derivative 119 as potent influenza A (H1N1) virus inhibitor was identified by using a cell-based high-throughput screening of around twenty thousand compounds. The structural novelty of the hit molecule encouraged them to further pursue the lead-optimization of this class through SAR exploration. Thiophenoyl substituted angellicin (120) emerged as the optimised lead exhibiting 64-fold enhanced activity compared to hit. The compound was found to be broad spectrum anti-influenzal agent effective against both influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B strains same as drug zanamivir. Further plasmid-based reverse genetics using luciferase assay yielded key insight into the molecular mechanism of angellicin derivatives which point toward viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) as a probable molecular target for these agents [84]. Later benzoyl substituted angelicin (121) (BPR2-D2) also emerged as a novel inhibitor against influenza virus exhibiting excellent antiviral efficacy against the oseltamivir-resistant virus (EC50 = 0.021\u20130.040 \u03bcM). BPR2-D2 also exhibited a broad antiviral spectrum against various strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses. The compound acts by targeting viral RNPs that are responsible for viral RNA synthesis [85]. This same molecule (BPR2-D2) was later established as an effective anti-HIV agent (BPRHIV001) which inhibits Tat-Mediated Transcription through Akt pathway (EC50 = 1.3 nM) [86]. Thus this molecule has the potential to become a promising lead compound for the development of a novel therapeutic agent effective against both HIV-1 and influenza infections (Fig. 24\n).",

In the year 1995, Ishikawa et al. isolated a unique coumarin-naphthoquinone dimer called toddacoumaquinone (122) from Toddalia asiatica (Rutaceae) and evaluated its antiviral activities against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The compound was found to be weakly active against HSV (EC50 = 10 \u03bcg/mL) but was ineffective against HIV [87]. Xu and colleagues have also demonstrated that inhibition of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) replication could be achieved by the use of (+) rutamarin (123) which is a natural furanocoumarin obtained from the plant Ruta graveolens L (common rue). In this study, a total of 7200 compounds were virtually screened for their topoisomerase II inhibition properties and subsequently tested for antiviral activities. Out of these, natural product (+) rutamarin, exhibited significant inhibition of both viral DNA synthesis and virion production, with relatively low cytotoxicity at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM. Precisely, (+) rutamarin exhibited excellent efficiency in blocking Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic DNA replication (EC50 = 1.62 \u03bcM) which is a proven etiological cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and other AIDS-associated malignancies. Thus, (+) rutamarin could be a potent clinical candidate for the treatment of human diseases associated with KSHV infection [88]. The sesquiterpene coumarin, kellerin (124) isolated from the gum resin of Ferula asafoetida significantly reduced the viral titre of the herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA viral strains KOS at concentrations of 10, 5 and 2.5 \u03bcg/mL with an inhibition rate of 98 \u00b1 5.2%, 80% and 65%, respectively.

In order to lower their toxicity, the active molecule was modified while preserving the cyclic \u03b1-dicarbonyl structure and prepared several Mannich bases 4-N,N-dialkylaminomethyl-3-hydroxycoumarins (126). Preliminary examination of these compounds did not show any appreciable antiviral activity (Fig. 26\n) [91]. However, the 4-bromobenzylidene derivative of bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) (127) were found to exert some inhibitory activity against HSV-1 (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and HSV-1 TK-KOS (ACVr) in the range of 9\u201312 \u03bcM [92].",

A set of doubly (uracil\u2013coumarin) and triply conjugates (uracil\u2013coumarin\u2013arenes) were evaluated to establish their SAR. The extension of the doubly conjugated uracil\u2013coumarins to triply conjugated uracil\u2013coumarin\u2013arenes by use of the \u2013SO2\u2013 linker was vital to their anti-CHIKV activity.

Coumarin 30 (130) was found to exhibit an IC50 value of 0.4 \u03bcM against SFV and a selectivity index of 308 and also found to be the most potent inhibitor of CHIKV-Rluc as well (IC50 value of 6.4 \u03bcM).

Since the 1990s, significant researches have been devoted to the development of antiviral coumarins. A diverse class of natural, semisynthetic and synthetic coumarin analogues have been reported as promising antiviral agents effective against the broad spectrum of viruses. Among these natural coumarins remain a fascinating rich source of lead compounds and boast ingenious functionalized motifs and proven to be important precursors to many effective antiviral drugs. Several classes of coumarins which were abandoned can be further improved in terms of efficacy and selectivity for the target or achieving optimal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Given all these promising results and the potential antiviral activity, coumarins could be used in future in the clinic. Moreover, this review will surely provide a new horizon for research on antiviral agents and give better understanding of role of these molecules in diseases and how therapeutic agents could be most effective.",
