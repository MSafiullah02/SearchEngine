            "text": "Despite being the most significant arboviral disease worldwide, dengue has no antiviral treatment or reliable severity predictors. It has been shown that apoptotic cells from blood and tissues may be involved in the complex pathogenesis of dengue. However, very little is known about the interplay between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mediators in this disease. Therefore, plasma levels of the three proapoptotic mediators Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were measured in dengue patients. Patients were classified according to the World Health Organization classification of dengue revised in 2009. Additionally, inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs) were determined in plasma (Survivin) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) lysates (cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP). Levels of apoptotic proteins in plasma were correlated with counts of blood cells. FasL and TRAIL levels were elevated in dengue patients without warning signs when compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. Dengue patients with warning signs showed decreased levels of Survivin compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. TRAIL was inversely correlated with counts of lymphocyte subsets. In contrast, Survivin was positively correlated with leukocyte counts. There was a trend of elevated IAPs levels in PBMCs of patients with severe dengue. The results suggest a likely antiviral effect of TRAIL in dengue. It appears that TRAIL might be involved with apoptosis induction of lymphocytes, whereas IAPs might participate in protecting leukocytes from apoptosis. Further research is needed to explore the interactions between pro and antiapoptotic molecules and their implications in dengue",

Modulation of the immune response by apoptosis during dengue has been reported previously in Thai children who showed higher levels of plasma soluble Fas in DHF than DF [Myint et al., 2006] . However, the present study was performed mainly in an adult population, and the measured circulating mediator was the FasL. There-fore, this is the first reported study of circulating FasL molecule in dengue. In this study, FasL values in patients with dengue without warning signs were elevated compared to those in patients with severe dengue and control subjects. However, the premortem detection of FasL in the only fatal dengue case showed the highest FasL value measured in the study. It is very likely this highest value was due to the plasma sample being obtained on the day of the death. More dengue fatalities should be studied to understand if the elevation of this proapoptotic mediator in the critical phase of dengue is related to fatal outcome and to explore the probable mechanisms of action involved. In the present study, elevated TRAIL levels were observed in patients with dengue without warning signs compared to those with severe dengue and control subjects. In addition, TRAIL levels discriminated patients with dengue with warning signs from patients with severe dengue. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated an increase of TRAIL production by DENV infection in a variety of human primary cells including umbilical vein endothelial cells [Warke et al., 2008b] , muscle satellite cells [Warke et al., 2008a] , dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells [Warke et al., 2008b; Becerra et al., 2009; Balas et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2012] . In these human primary cells was not demonstrated an apoptotic activity of TRAIL. Conversely, antiviral action of TRAIL was shown by recombinant TRAIL pretreatment of monocytes and dendritic cells [Warke et al., 2008b] .",

The TRAIL hypothesis, that TRAIL antiviral action is not direct, in dengue infection is supported by recent findings of Shrestha et al. [2012] . These authors demonstrated that TRAIL secreted by CD8\u00fe T cells provides antiviral signals to neurons infected by West Nile virus (a flavivirus closely related to DENV). The effect was studied in the central nervous system of a mouse model and in primary culture of mouse cortical neurons. This work suggests that TRAIL produced by CD8\u00fe T cells is necessary but not sufficient to confer an antiviral effect, and that such an effect requires additional secreted cytokines and/or cytolytic activities by the CD8\u00fe T cells.",

The antiapoptotic protein Survivin is studied in dengue infection for the first time in the present study. This molecule showed variable levels with reduced levels in patients with dengue without warning signs as compared to control subjects and patients with severe dengue. Survivin was positively correlated with counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and CD14\u00fe monocytes in the dengue patients studied. Although this work did not verify experimentally the exocytosis of Survivin and the extracellular action of Survivin on white blood cells, these correlation results suggest that Survivin may be associated with proliferation of leukocytes, and specially monocytes during dengue. Additionally, elevated Survivin levels may provide more protection against apoptosis in these immunological blood cells from the circulation of the dengue patients studied.",

This result suggests that the IAPs may be involved with apoptosis inhibition in PBMCs, however, it is not clear whether this antiapoptotic effect of IAPs might counteract the probable induction of apoptosis by TRAIL in circulating lymphocytes.

We highly regret he could not participate in the final work because he died. We thank Jaqueline Bastos for the dengue diagnostics in the Flavivirus Laboratory at FIOCRUZ. We also acknowledge the staff from the Pl\u00ednio Bacelar Laboratory headed by Dr. Carlos Bacelar and Prefeitura Municipal de Campos de Goytacazes. We are grateful to the clinical and nursing staff of the participating healthcare facilities. The preparation of this manuscript was improved by the intensive course in research writing at Texas A&M University (TAMU). We thank the main instructor of the course, Dr. Barbara Gastel, and her university colleagues. Dr. Daniel Limonta received a scholarship to attend this international course.",
