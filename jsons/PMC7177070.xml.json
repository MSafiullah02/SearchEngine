We showed that, despite the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis, the rate of venous and arterial thromboembolic complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was remarkable, approximately 8%. Indeed, this already high figure may represent an underestimation of the actual values. We postulate this based on four key findings: (i) VTE was actively searched in only 10% of COVID-19 patients, (ii) one third of VTE imaging tests were positive, (iii) more than half of venous or arterial thromboembolic events were diagnosed within the first 24 h of hospital admission, representing often the first manifestation of COVID-19, (iv) the vast majority of PE events was \u201cunquestionable\u201d from a radiological/anatomical perspective and no diagnosis was \"incidental\".",

In a recent Dutch paper, symptomatic VTE was diagnosed in 28 (15% of total; cumulative rate 27%) of 184 patients receiving thromboprophylaxis during intensive care and mainly consisted of PE (n = 25) [10]. In the Dutch study, only a minority of patients experienced arterial thrombotic events (n = 3). According to a Chinese study, the prevalence of VTE was 25% with routine VTE screening, although details on the type and timing of screening were not provided [11]. These values appear much higher than the rate of symptomatic VTE events observed in thromboprophylaxis trials, not exceeding 3% in patients not receiving anticoagulant therapy and <1% on thromboprophylaxis [13], but in line with what observed in patients with sepsis or shock [14,15]. A recent analysis from a French group showed that the rate of thromboembolic complications in 150 COVID-19 patients with ARDS was much higher (11.7%) than what observed in a historical control group of non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (2.1%) despite anticoagulation [16].",

Consistently, the proportion of positive CTPA out of total CTPA performed (33%) appeared higher than that of positive CUS (21%) out of total CUS performed. As indirect as this evidence is, one may postulate that in case of suspected PE, the execution of CUS may be logistically more feasible but give less useful information and delay CTPA testing. It has been suggested that the use of higher prophylaxis dosages may improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients [10,17]. The results of our analysis suggest that a lower threshold of suspicion to perform VTE imaging tests may be reasonable, even upon admission or in the very early phases of COVID-19. We observed at least half of thromboembolic events were diagnosed within the first 24 h of admission and, therefore, not preventable by in-hospital thromboprophylaxis, which would have been otherwise inadequately dosed in the presence of acute VTE.",

In several country, a number of patients is being managed on an ambulatory basis, also for logistical reasons. The burden of thromboembolic complications in these patients is unknown. Our data, which represent conditional probabilities and should therefore be carefully interpreted, suggest that this may represent an underestimated, large-scale issue requiring rapid answers. A randomized controlled trial, the OVID trial, is being planned to study whether prophylactic-dose enoxaparin (vs. no treatment) may reduce early all-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalizations in adult symptomatic ambulatory COVID-19 patients with no other indications to receive anticoagulation.",

This may have influenced not only patients' outcome, as no global experience on the disease was available yet, but also the execution and frequency of imaging tests during hospitalization. From this perspective, we could not confirm whether thromboembolic events contributed substantially to such a dramatic mortality and no autopsies were routinely performed in COVID-19 patients.
