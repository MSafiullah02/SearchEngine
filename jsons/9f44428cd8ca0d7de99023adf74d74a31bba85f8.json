Presumably because of their long history of coevolution, most of these viruses remain subclinical in bats, but have the potential to cause severe illnesses in domestic and wildlife animals and also humans. Spillovers from bats to humans either happen directly (via contact with infected bats) or indirectly (via intermediate hosts such as domestic or wildlife animals, by consuming food items contaminated by saliva, faeces or urine of bats, or via other environmental sources). Increasing numbers of breakouts of zoonotic viral diseases among humans and livestock have mainly been accounted to human encroachment into natural habitat, as well as agricultural intensification, deforestation and bushmeat consumption. Persecution of bats, including the destruction of their roosts and culling of whole colonies, has led not only to declines of protected bat species, but also to an increase in virus prevalence in some of these populations.

Post-infection survival is supported by the frequent identification of antibodies to known viruses in apparently healthy bats and longterm survival of these bats (e.g. Hayman et al. 2010) . Additionally, viruses isolated or genetically detected from bat populations are highly diverse and often ancestral to related viruses in human and other mammalian species (e.g. Towner et al. 2009; Drexler et al. 2012; Baker et al. 2013a; Tong et al. 2013; Vidgen et al. 2015) . Together, these findings suggest a long history of coevolution between many bat-virus relationships identified to date. Recent progress in the field of bat immunology and genomics has identified key differences in bat immunity and physiology that evolved concomitantly with the evolution of flight, resulting not only in apparently increased immunotolerance of intracellular pathogens, but also in increased longevity and decreased tumour production (Baker et al. 2013b; Zhang et al. 2013; Brook and Dobson 2015) . Immunotolerance and incomplete clearance of viral infections are also likely to favour the establishment of persistent infections (Virgin et al. 2009 ), as proposed for a number of bat-borne viruses .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 243, "text": "(Brook and Dobson 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 414, "end": 433, "text": "Hayman et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 613, "end": 632, "text": "Towner et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}, {"start": 633, "end": 653, "text": "Drexler et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 654, "end": 673, "text": "Baker et al. 2013a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 674, "end": 691, "text": "Tong et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}, {"start": 692, "end": 711, "text": "Vidgen et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1184, "text": "(Baker et al. 2013b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1203, "text": "Zhang et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1226, "text": "Brook and Dobson 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1378, "text": "(Virgin et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emerging Viral Diseases: Why Bats?"}, {"text": "Various ecological and life-history factors play a key role in the susceptibility of individuals and populations to pathogens (Allen et al. 2009; Turmelle et al. 2010; Schneeberger et al. 2013) , and notable differences exist between bats and terrestrial mammals such as rodents (Luis et al. 2013) . For example, the often high-population densities and the usually gregarious roosting behaviour of bats increase the likelihood of both intra-and interspecies transmission of viruses (Luis et al. 2013; Streicker et al. 2010) . Large-scale movements of bats due to their ability for powered flight are also likely to facilitate viral transmission within and among species, including the exchange of novel viruses and virus variants across biomes or even continents (Calisher et al. 2006; Epstein et al. 2009; Peel et al. 2013) . The extreme relative longevity of bats compared to other mammals of similar size (Wilkinson and South 2002) and the potential for persistent and/or subclinical viral infections could further increase transmission potential (Calisher et al. 2006) . Reduction of body temperature associated with hibernation of temperate zone bats lowers both viral activity and the metabolism of hosts, leading to increased incubation periods and therefore reduced likelihood of epizootic fadeout (of rabies, for example; George et al. 2011) . Bats are ancient mammals in evolutionary terms, and virus utilisation of highly conserved cellular receptors could facilitate transmission to other mammals (Calisher et al. 2006) , for example, as has been suggested for henipaviruses (Negrete et al. 2005) . Lastly, it was recently speculated that, similar to the febrile response of other mammals, the relatively high body temperature (about 38-41 \u00b0C) and metabolism of bats during flight may select for viruses tolerant to such conditions, meaning the normal febrile defence mechanism of other mammals is ineffective (\"Flight as fever hypothesis\", O'Shea et al. 2014) , making bat-borne viruses potentially more virulent and lethal for other, non-flying mammals. Kuzmin et al. 2011a ), which has a wide distribution across Mexico, Central America, and South America. Bites from this species appear to be responsible for the majority of human and domestic animal rabies infections of bat origin in South and Central America, with increased prey availability via expansion of livestock into new areas across the region hypothesised to be contributing to increasing incidences (Schneider et al. 2009; Ruiz and Ch\u00e1vez 2010) . In Canada and the USA, 51 cases of human rabies transmitted by non-haematophagous bats were recognised or inferred between 1951 and 2006 (mostly silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), eastern pipistrelle bats (Perimyotis subflavus) and Brazilian/Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis)) (Constantine and Blehert 2009; Banyard et al. 2011) . However, across the Americas, only 15 % of human rabies cases between 1993 and 2002 were reported as resulting from encounters with bats (Belotto et al. 2005) . Reported antibody prevalences against RABV in D. rotundus include 3-28 % in Peru (Streicker et al. 2012 ) and 12 % in Brazil (Almeida et al. 2011) . Depending on the year, location and species, prevalence in other bats varies from relatively low 2 % in T. brasiliensis in New Mexico (Steece and Altenbach 1989) and 2.5 % in the little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in New York (Trimarchi and Debbie 1977) , to 58 % in Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata) in Peru (Salm\u00f3n-Mulanovich et al. 2009 ) and 67 % in T. brasiliensis in Texas (Baer and Smith 1991) . As with other lyssaviruses discussed below, the potential for high antibody prevalences in bat populations and infrequent reports of mortality suggest that many individuals exposed to the virus survive, contrary to the overwhelmingly lethal nature of lyssavirus infections in other mammalian species (reviewed in Banyard et al. 2011) . The mechanisms for this remain unclear. a Lyssaviral phylogenies infer WCBV, LLEBV and IKOW that are more genetically distinct from other species, and they have not yet been assigned a phylogroup (Kuzmin 2014) b Barrett (2004) Seven bat lyssaviruses have been isolated in Eurasia (Table 10 .1). European bat lyssavirus type 1 and type 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2; Bourhy et al. 1992 ) are the most widely recognised and studied. Five fatal cases of human infections with EBLV have so far been reported, three from EBLV-1 (Roine et al. 1988; Selimov et al. 1989; Botvinkin et al. 2005) and two from EBLV-2 (Lumio et al. 1986; Fooks et al. 2003; Nathwani et al. 2003) . Spillover of EBLV-1 into other mammals has also been observed, but rarely, with examples including zoo bats (R\u00f8nsholt et al. 1998) , sheep (Tj\u00f8rneh\u00f8j et al. 2006 ), domestic cats (Dacheux et al. 2009 ) and a stone marten (M\u00fcller et al. 2004) . While EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 have been detected in a range of bat species (reviewed in Schatz et al. 2013) , they are most frequently associated with serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) and Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii), respectively. The dynamics of EBLV infections in their natural hosts is poorly understood, but banding and recapture data and the frequent capture of apparently healthy bats with antibodies against EBLV suggest that many bats survive infection (Serra-Cobo et al. 2002; Amengual et al. 2007; Schatz et al. 2013) . In cases where bats develop clinical symptoms of EBLV infection, the affected individuals are often unable to fly, are generally weak and show abnormal behaviour, including attempts to bite (Banyard et al. 2011) . Experimental studies suggest that variable development of clinical signs may be related to inoculation route and dose (reviewed in Banyard et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 145, "text": "(Allen et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 146, "end": 167, "text": "Turmelle et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}, {"start": 168, "end": 193, "text": "Schneeberger et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 279, "end": 297, "text": "(Luis et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 482, "end": 500, "text": "(Luis et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 501, "end": 523, "text": "Streicker et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 763, "end": 785, "text": "(Calisher et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 786, "end": 806, "text": "Epstein et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 807, "end": 824, "text": "Peel et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 908, "end": 934, "text": "(Wilkinson and South 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1072, "text": "(Calisher et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1350, "text": "George et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1531, "text": "(Calisher et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1608, "text": "(Negrete et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1972, "text": "O'Shea et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2087, "text": "Kuzmin et al. 2011a", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 2479, "end": 2502, "text": "(Schneider et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2524, "text": "Ruiz and Ch\u00e1vez 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 2832, "end": 2862, "text": "(Constantine and Blehert 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2863, "end": 2883, "text": "Banyard et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3023, "end": 3044, "text": "(Belotto et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3128, "end": 3150, "text": "(Streicker et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 3172, "end": 3193, "text": "(Almeida et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3330, "end": 3357, "text": "(Steece and Altenbach 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3451, "text": "(Trimarchi and Debbie 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3552, "text": "(Salm\u00f3n-Mulanovich et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 3592, "end": 3613, "text": "(Baer and Smith 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3929, "end": 3949, "text": "Banyard et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4148, "end": 4161, "text": "(Kuzmin 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 4164, "end": 4178, "text": "Barrett (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4309, "end": 4327, "text": "Bourhy et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4466, "end": 4485, "text": "(Roine et al. 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 4486, "end": 4506, "text": "Selimov et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 4507, "end": 4529, "text": "Botvinkin et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 4550, "end": 4569, "text": "(Lumio et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 4570, "end": 4588, "text": "Fooks et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 4589, "end": 4610, "text": "Nathwani et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 4721, "end": 4743, "text": "(R\u00f8nsholt et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 4752, "end": 4774, "text": "(Tj\u00f8rneh\u00f8j et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 4775, "end": 4812, "text": "), domestic cats (Dacheux et al. 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4834, "end": 4854, "text": "(M\u00fcller et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 4939, "end": 4958, "text": "Schatz et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 5324, "end": 5348, "text": "(Serra-Cobo et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 5349, "end": 5370, "text": "Amengual et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 5371, "end": 5390, "text": "Schatz et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 5583, "end": 5604, "text": "(Banyard et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 5738, "end": 5758, "text": "Banyard et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4232, "end": 4241, "text": "(Table 10", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Emerging Viral Diseases: Why Bats?"}, {"text": "Comparatively, little is known about the remaining Eurasian bat lyssaviruses, which have each been isolated from bats only once: West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV, Botvinkin et al. 2003) , Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV, Freuling et al. 2011) , Aravan virus (ARAV, Kuzmin et al. 1991) , Irkut virus (IRKV, Botvinkin et al. 2003) and Khujand virus (KHUV, Kuzmin et al. 2001) , or is only known from partial genetic sequence data (Lleida virus, Ceballos et al. 2013, Table 10 .1).

Most human infections have been traced down to close contacts with dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), which carry a virus with a similar genome organisation as human MERS (Hemida et al. 2014) . There is at least one report of direct transmission of the virus from camels to humans via contact with infected animals (Memish et al. 2014 ).

All Ebola outbreaks recorded until 2004 in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo have been linked to handling of gorilla, chimpanzee or duiker carcasses, species that can carry the Ebola virus (Leroy et al. 2004; Pigott et al. 2014 ). It has thus became apparent that spillover from animals to humans occurs through hunting, butchering and consumption of bushmeat (Gonzalez et al. 2005; Li and Chen 2014; Chap. 12) , followed by fast human-to-human transmission (World Health Organization 2014). An outbreak of Ebola in Congo in 2007 that resulted in 260 infected humans of whom 186 died has been traced to a potential direct transmission from a dead fruit bat that the first human victim bought from hunters to eat (Leroy et al. 2009 ). Antibodies against Ebola virus have since been detected in a total of 14 bat species, with seroprevalences of up to 44 % depending on species and location (Olival and Hayman 2014) . Experimental infection of several bat species with Ebola led to high replication of the virus, but to no apparent signs of illness, suggesting that Ebola infections are subclinical in these species (Swanepoel et al. 1996) . One Eidolon helvum has survived for at least 13 months after being tested seropositive for Ebola virus and Lagos bat virus, indicating longterm survival of an individual bat following exposure to these viruses . The recent outbreak of Ebola in Guinea and neighbouring countries in 2013-countries that are at significant distance to the previous outbreaks in central Africa-has caused speculations about a possible transmission of the virus by migrating fruit bats (Bausch and Schwarz 2014; Vogel 2014). However, as the strain of the west African Ebola virus is a genetic outlier within the known Ebola viruses, it has been argued that the west African variant may have emerged from local wildlife populations rather than from migrating individuals (Gatherer 2014) .

The fact that lyssaviruses are occasionally found in temperate zone bats sometimes finds its way to the media, not always in favour of bats. Biased newspaper articles or press campaigns may result in the public misconception that bats are aggressive animals or that their mere presence can lead to human infections with these viruses. Although there are anecdotal reports of unprovoked attacks of bats on humans and dogs (Baer and Smith 1991) , bats, as is the case of most mammals, usually only bite when handled or provoked. Furthermore, once bitten or scratched by a bat, immediate post-exposure vaccination can prevent a person from contracting rabies (see Sect. 10.5.2). In the case of the 37-year-old woman who died from a bat lyssavirus infection in Kenya, staff members of the health facility which the woman visited after being scratched by a bat were unaware of the possibility of rabies transmission (van Thiel et al. 2009 ). Likewise, two persons in Europe who worked regularly with bats and died from rabies after being bitten and scratched by bats received neither pre-nor post-exposure treatment (Roine et al. 1988; Nathwani et al. 2003) . These two cases triggered a Europe-wide serological screening effort involving more than 11,000 bats, with seroprevalences varying depending on the species and location (Racey et al. 2012 ). EBLV-1 was most commonly detected in the serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus), while EBLV-2 was very uncommon in all bat species. As a result, the public has been persuaded not to handle bats or to do so only with gloves and, in the case of bat workers, to receive pre-and/or post-exposure immunisation. Two fatal cases in which persons contracted rabies in Australia (Samaratunga et al. 1998; Hanna et al. 2000 ) triggered a similar campaign on this continent (Speare et al. 1997 , but see Francis et al. 2014) . Efficient education of medical professionals worldwide seems to be pivotal for implementing the correct treatment after scratches or bites from bats. In addition, vaccination should be mandatory for those who are frequently exposed to bats (Rupprecht and Gibbons 2004) . Studies on animal models have shown that rabies vaccine also provides protection against other, although not all, lyssaviruses' variants (Brookes et al. 2005; Hanlon et al. 2005) . However, there is no known case of a person developing bat-associated rabies despite having been vaccinated, neither pre-nor post-exposure.

Some of the investigated bat species are listed as near threatened or vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with decreasing population sizes even in many species of least concern.

In South-East Asia, flying foxes are hunted regularly for the purpose of food (Mickleburgh et al. 2002; Mildenstein et al. 2016, Chap. 12) , sometimes even authorised by the local Wildlife Department such as in Malaysia (Breed et al. 2006) . Likewise, fruit bats are consumed regularly throughout Africa (Mickleburgh et al. 2009; Mildenstein et al. 2016, Chap. 12) . Since bats are suggested as potential reservoir for the recent outbreak of Ebola, Guinea banned bats for sale from markets (Gatherer 2014) . Educational efforts to reduce the threat both to public health by zoonotic diseases and to the conservation of local bat populations are challenging, as they are usually impeded by the lack of understanding of entrenched cultural behaviours and social components (Pooley et al. 2015; Kingston 2016, Chap. 18) . In Ghana, for example, where the consumption of bats is part of the local culture and traditions, a survey revealed that knowledge about the ecological and economical value of bats would not make people refrain from killing and eating bats (Kamins et al. (left) in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, as compared to former roosting trees that have been cut (right) after bats were suspected to be the source of the recent Ebola outbreak in western Africa (photograph credits: Simon Ghanem) 2014). Usually, the direct economic benefit from selling hunted bats is more valuable to an individual person than the indirect, not always obvious economic value of bats, for example, for agriculture. However, about half of the hunters stated they would stop hunting bats if they could make them sick (Kamins et al. 2014 ). This highlights the potential effectiveness of public education, but careful consideration is needed to avoid demonising bats in the process (Pooley et al. 2015) . The recent Ebola epidemic in western Africa for example has led to an increase in the persecution of bats, with roosts being destroyed and colonies being killed by communities ( Fig. 10.1) .

For example, in Central and South America, the conversion of forested habitats into pastures shifted the dominant food source for vampire bats from native vertebrates to livestock. This has increased rabies transmission from vampire bats to livestock and domestic animals in many parts of Latin America (Schneider et al. 2009 ). Where bat habitats have been converted largely into agricultural farmland, the remaining bat populations are forced to concentrate in patches that provide them with resources they need. Flying foxes, for example, are highly sensitive to landscape modifications, as they require large forested areas for foraging. Where natural habitats are scarce, flying foxes may use fruiting or flowering trees in agricultural, suburban and urban areas, which increases the contact zone and spillover risk between bats and livestock or humans Plowright et al. 2015) .

Anthropogenic transformation of bat habitats in Australia has also been shown to lead to decreased migration in Pteropus bats, which can itself lead to a decline in population immunity (Plowright et al. 2011 ). This could give rise to more viral shedding after local viral reintroduction, a mechanism that may be facilitated by urban habituation of fruit bat and the resulting increased contact with human and domestic animal populations Plowright et al. 2011) . In Australia, all recently emerged bat-associated viruses-Hendra, Menangle and Australian bat lyssavirus-are hypothesised to be associated with habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural intensification (Jones et al. 2013) . Therefore, protection of remaining natural habitats of bats along with farm management aiming at decreasing the contact zone between bats and livestock as well as education plans increasing awareness of environmental issues and safety may play a crucial role in the avoidance of future spillovers of bat-borne diseases to livestock and human populations, and promote further protection of local bat populations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 304, "text": "(Field 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 475, "end": 496, "text": "(Roberts et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 684, "end": 706, "text": "(Plowright et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 937, "end": 959, "text": "Plowright et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1192, "text": "(Jones et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conservation of Bat Populations and Population Dynamics"}, {"text": "Bats harbour viruses that may become zoonotic.
