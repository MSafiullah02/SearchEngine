            "text": "The majority of pathogens implicated in causing acute bronchitis are viruses, with pathogens documented in only a minority of patients studied (16\u201329%).8, 9 To date, only a handful of viruses and even fewer bacteria have been recognized to cause acute bronchitis (Table 27-1\n). Despite laboratory isolation of the typical community-acquired pneumonia bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis in 26% of investigated cases of acute bronchitis in one study,7 there is no convincing causation data to show bronchial wall invasion by such typical bacteria. In contrast, influenza A viral infection of large airways results in rapid cytopathologic change, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate and associated denuding of the airway epithelial barrier.19 Human parainfluenza viruses, which in immunocompetent subjects only causes self-limiting respiratory disease, exhibit a tropism towards superficial ciliated cells, with budding of virions directed to apical epithelial surfaces. Human parainfluenza virus infection also leads to inhibition of ciliary motility, which plausibly contributes to impaired clearance of mucus and cellular debris.10, 20 Respiratory syncytial virus resembles parainfluenza virus in having limited cytopathic potential in human airway epithelium, and targeting the superficial ciliated cells with resultant impaired ciliary beating.21, 22 Minimal discernible epithelial necrosis or sloughing occurs in human rhinovirus-mediated acute bronchitis, and the symptoms are thought to reflect activation of host defense and inflammatory responses, as with the other less cytopathic respiratory viruses.23 Interestingly, there is some in vitro evidence to suggest greater susceptibility to rhinovirus infection of bronchial rather than nasal epithelium, though rhinovirus is a more prevalent cause of upper respiratory than lower respiratory tract infections.24 The bacterial pathogen best described to cause acute bronchitis symptoms is Bordetella pertussis, which adheres to ciliated respiratory epithelial cells and induces local tissue damage via tracheal cytotoxin, dermonecrotic toxin or adenylate cyclase, among other biologically active substances and virulence factors.25 Another causative bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, produces adherence proteins that have a particular affinity for respiratory tract epithelium, and subsequent to attachment, the bacteria release hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and a vacuolating cytotoxin that are toxic to ciliated epithelial cells.26, 27\n",

By definition, acute bronchitis is a primary diagnosis, and not secondary to an underlying chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma. Any fever is generally low-grade. Severe paroxysmal cough, with or without cough-induced emesis and a more prolonged course, should prompt consideration of pertussis infection, and requires a high index of suspicion to make the diagnosis.",

Some erroneously assume that the presence of purulent sputum indicates serious infection, though fewer than 5% of patients with discolored sputum have evidence of pneumonia.28 The practical diagnostic difficulties provide the rationale to find a tool that may predict bacterial rather than viral infection, such as procalcitonin (PCT), a peptide pre-hormone of calcitonin, normally secreted by C cells of the thyroid in response to hypercalcemia, with low levels in serum (<0.5 ng/mL), but also elaborated in inflammatory states, being produced by liver hepatocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and modulated by lipopolysaccharides and sepsis-related chemokine signals.29, 30, 31 Its upregulation appears to be abrogated by interferon-gamma-mediated inhibition in the setting of viral infection, rendering PCT more specific for bacterial infection. A recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials (4221 participants, mainly in Europe), examining whether or not procalcitonin levels could be used to safely guide therapy decisions in settings varying from primary care to ICU, concluded that the strategy was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure, and significantly reduced antibiotic consumption across all clinical settings and types of acute respiratory tract infection.32 A significant minority studied had acute bronchitis. A recent multinational real-life observational study showed that those with acute bronchitis (253 patients) had the highest compliance with a PCT-guided antibiotic-treatment algorithm for lower respiratory tract infections (81%, vs 70.1% for acute exacerbations of COPD and vs 63.7% for community-acquired pneumonia; p < 0.001). Overall, in this study that encouraged the use of highly sensitive immunoassays for PCT measurement, it was found that antibiotic therapy duration was shorter if the PCT algorithm was complied with.33 While the data are encouraging, the use of PCT in routine care awaits further validation in large trials.",

As the vast majority of cases of acute bronchitis are not bacterial in origin and are self-limiting, there are well-founded concerns that over-prescription of antibiotics for acute bronchitis could lead to an excess of adverse drug reactions, costs and antimicrobial resistance.28, 35 In the most recent Cochrane systematic review of antibiotic therapy in data from randomized controlled trials involving more than 3000 instances of acute respiratory tract infection, the treatment strategy resulting in least antibiotic use and comparable patient-related outcomes was to avoid prescribing antibiotics and advise the patient to return if symptoms did not resolve.35 It has been suggested that anti-inflammatory therapy might reduce the cough symptom in acute bronchitis.3, 36 A recent Spanish primary care study of 416 subjects randomized to receive the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid or placebo for uncomplicated acute bronchitis and discolored sputum showed no significant differences in the number of days with cough (ibuprofen: 9 days, 95% CI 8\u201310; amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic: 11 days, 95% CI 10\u201312; placebo: 11 days, 95% CI 8\u201314).37\n",

A diverse array of conditions is associated with the development of bronchiectasis to a varying extent and severity (see Table 27-2\n). An example of a recognized etiology is shown in Figure 27-1\n. However, despite an exhaustive work-up, there may be no cause found in half of all cases.47 It is envisaged that important advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis will result from collaborations in the form of patient registries, as have been established.48\n",

The study authors contended that changes in microbiota composition do not account for exacerbations of bronchiectasis, while conceding that potential pathobiological interactions among microbes or alterations in microbial genetic factors remain unexplored as potential mechanisms of exacerbation.52 Others have shown clinical measures of bronchiectatic disease activity can be related to the lower airway microbiota. Rogers and co-workers showed that the more diverse the lower airway microbiota in non-CF bronchiectasis, the higher the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), likely reflecting less overgrowth by pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. The same group also showed that bacterial community composition similarity correlated significantly with neutrophil inflammation, cough-specific symptoms and lung function.53 Recently, Purcell et al. from the UK evaluated sputa from 70 non-CF bronchiectasis outpatients with culture and pyrosequencing and found no relationship of bacterial community diversity with lung function, antibiotic therapy or gender, though they found that P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae exerted a significant effect on the diversity of the bacterial community in the lungs of their patients.54 A larger number of taxa (27), including Pasteurellaceae, Streptococcaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Burkholderiales, Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae, were associated with acute exacerbations, whereas a smaller number of taxa (11), including Pseudomonas spp., correlated with stable states, suggesting that the bacterial community in the lungs of exacerbating patients has a more dynamic community composition than that seen in stable patients, somewhat at odds with the earlier findings of Tunney et al. using similar pyrosequencing technologies.52 This more recent study did not evaluate the stability of this signal over differing timepoints, however.54 Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) appear to be uncommonly identified in non-CF bronchiectasis, detected in 2% of 100 patients in one cohort, with a predilection towards Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).55 Another large cohort study of 98 adult-onset bronchiectasis patients identified 10% with NTM.56\n",

The optimal test with which to make the diagnosis is high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan imaging, preferably using helical high-resolution multi\u00addetector technology that is usually available, looking for evidence of airway dilation and mucus plugging. The dilated airways are suggested by the lack of bronchial tapering (see Figure 27-2\n), the presence of ring shadows (sometimes accompanied by mucus/secretions) and the signet ring sign (cross-sectional luminal airway diameter greater than the diameter of the adjacent vessel, see Figure 27-3\n). Dilated airways are reproducibly suggestive of bronchiectasis when the lumen is at least 1.5 times the diameter of the accompanying vessel.59 Mucus plugging involves large and/or small airways, with the latter site resulting in appearances known as tree-in-bud (see Figures 27-2 and 27-4\n).",

The therapeutic interventions are intended to enhance quality of life, preserve pulmonary function and minimize healthcare utilization. Such is the inherent difficulty in producing robust evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety in this diverse patient population that, as of yet, no pharmaceutical agent has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-CF bronchiectasis. Significant progress has been made, however, and the condition is attracting greater attention now than in the past. It is important to direct therapy against the underlying cause of bronchiectasis where known, as appropriate. Acute management is based on identifying those in need of inpatient therapy and refining antibiotic selection to reflect isolated pathogens and local resistance patterns, with augmented airway clearance techniques and dealing with specific situations including hemoptysis. The need for surgical interventions such as lung transplantation or surgery to remove severely damaged segments or lobes that perpetuate infection or hemorrhage, should continue to recede with earlier identification and better medical management. Over recent years, some data have begun to accrue that specifically address non-CF bronchiectasis management, with important lessons learnt, for example the potential danger of CF therapies being indiscriminately extrapolated to non-CF patients, as with aerosolized recombinant deoxyribonuclease (dornase-alpha).61\n",

            "text": "It is intuitively attractive to aim to suppress the bacterial burden for symptomatic patients with bronchiectasis who have failed measures to have a pathogenic organism eradicated. Where P. aeruginosa is first identified in sputum, it is recommended that eradication be attempted with a 2-week course of an oral antipseudomonal agent such as ciprofloxacin 750 mg BD, with further regimens a consideration for those who fail to clear the organism, such as intravenous and inhaled anti\u00adpseudomonals.66 Patients who continue to have copious sputum and frequent infective episodes can be considered for more prolonged antibiotic therapy. In support of such an approach, there is a clear proportional relationship between airway bacterial load on the one hand and measures of systemic and airway inflammation, exacerbations and health-related quality of life on the other. The inflammation will lessen with short- and long-term antibiotic interventions.67 Long-term oral antibiotics have been in clinical use and studied as an intervention for bronchiectasis patients for decades. A systematic Cochrane review in 2007 of nine eligible trials concluded there was a small benefit to the use of prolonged antibiotics in treating purulent bronchiectasis in children and adults.68 Where non-macrolide oral antibiotics are concerned (such as amoxicillin or doxycycline), it would seem reasonable to consider a prolonged suppressive regimen for patients who are suffering from at least three exacerbations a year and who cannot be considered for long-term macrolide regimens, provided they are not colonized with P. aeruginosa.\n66 Nontuberculous mycobacteria are problematic pathogens when present and should not be treated with macrolide monotherapy, but rather in accordance with American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.69\n",

The Australian BLESS trial randomized 117 non-CF bronchiectasis patients to receive either twice daily erythromycin ethylsuccinate (400 mg BD per os) or placebo for one year, at a single center. Patients had to have had two or more exacerbations in the preceding year. Erythromycin was shown to modestly reduce protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations (mean events 1.29 vs 1.97 per patient per year, p = 0.003), reduce sputum production and attenuate the decline in lung function (mean difference in FEV1 of 2.2% of predicted, p = 0.04), at a cost of increased macrolide-resistant oropharyngeal streptococci (median change 27.7% vs 0.04% in placebo subjects, p < 0.001).70\nPseudomonas-colonized patients also gained from having fewer such exacerbations in the active treatment arm.70 A recent multicenter randomized trial emanating from the Netherlands, the BAT trial, evaluated 12 months of daily azithromycin (250 mg) versus placebo in 83 bronchiectasis patients having had at least three lower respiratory tract infections in the previous year. While macrolide resistance was again noted (88% with azithromycin, 26% with placebo), the active therapy group experienced fewer exacerbations (p < 0.001), with at least one exacerbation occurring in 46% of azithromycin-treated subjects versus 80% of those on placebo (hazard ratio 0.29 [95% CI 0.16\u20130.51]).62 The EMBRACE trial, which enrolled those with at least one exacerbation of bronchiectasis in the previous year, found that 6 months of three-times-a-week azithromycin (500 mg) reduced the exacerbation frequency rate compared to placebo (relative reduction 0.38 [95% CI 0.26\u20130.54]), though without a benefit in terms of lung function or quality of life in this shorter study.64\n",

There are promising indicators nonetheless. Inhaled gentamicin has been used off-label in non-CF bronchiectasis by reconstituting 80 mg of the intravenous preparation in 0.9% saline to the 5 mL volume employed in commonly used nebulizer systems, and given as a twice-daily regimen. Such therapy has been shown over 3 days to reduce microbial load, sputum myeloperoxidase (as a surrogate of neutrophil quantity) and sputum volume, improve peak expiratory flow rates and improve exercise capacity as assessed by Borg breathlessness scores and 6-minute walk test distance.79 A more recent single-masked study randomized 65 patients to a year of either nebulized gentamicin or nebulized normal saline and found that gentamicin therapy led to a reduction in sputum bacterial density, with the secondary endpoint of exacerbation frequency also favoring gentamicin over placebo (0 [IQR 0\u20131] vs 1.5 [IGR 1\u20132], p<0.0001), though all outcome measures reverted to baseline at 3-month follow-up, attesting to the lack of durable response off therapy.77\n",

            "text": "When a patient with bronchiectasis experiences the symptoms of an acute exacerbation (see Table 27-3), sputum should be sent for bacterial and mycobacterial stains and culture, with antibiotic therapy initiated pending the results of these samples, and based on the patient's prior sputum results where known. When there is no available prior bacteriologic information on a patient's sputum, empiric therapy should be directed against Pseudomonas but be cognizant of other frequently isolated pathogens, including H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The quinolones levofloxacin or moxifloxacin would be appropriate choices, given the broader spectrum of activity of such quinolones compared to ciprofloxacin, provided patients are counseled regarding the risk for quinolone-associated tendinopathy, especially in older, renally impaired patients or those on concomitant steroids.87\nClostridium difficile colitis is another concern, as with many other antibiotics, especially in the elderly. A chest radiograph helps rule out other noninfective causes of exacerbation such as pneumonia or less commonly, a pneumothorax. The majority of patients experiencing an exacerbation can be treated in the outpatient setting. When sputum results are known, therapy can be tailored to reflect sensitivity results, aiming for the optimum balance among efficacy and toxicity. As many patients with bronchiectasis can have resistant strains of bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, which have no orally active form of therapy, intravenous therapy is required, which may be provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis (the latter if the patient satisfies local service criteria), but admission to hospital is advised if the patient displays significant tachypnea, hypotension, confusion, hypoxemia or fever. The British Thoracic Society guidelines make an expert recommendation of combination antibiotics in the setting of resistant Pseudomonas, while acknowledging the issue as controversial. Some may prefer to decide on single versus combination therapy based on overall initial severity at presentation, though firm data for either approach are lacking. Where aminoglycosides are used, they should only be in addition to another agent, not as monotherapy, and require protocols for monitoring with pharmacy involvement, aiming for a peak concentration of 7\u201310 mg/L and a trough concentration of <2 mg/L.56 The presence of renal impairment, advanced patient age and the typically lengthy 14-day duration of antibiotics given for bronchiectasis exacerbations highlight the need for particular vigilance to toxicity in those receiving aminoglycosides.",

            "text": "Acute bronchitis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis reflect opposing ends of the spectra of chronicity, incidence and severity of infectious airway diseases and both have traditionally suffered from a dearth of research focus. Acute bronchitis, generally virally mediated, represents an opportunity for the healthcare professions to make a favorable impact on the emerging epidemic of antimicrobial resistance, though influenza needs to be carefully considered. Of late there is heightened interest in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in particular, stemming from an increased rate of detection, better understanding of the underlying pathobiology and the unmet clinical need for proven licensed therapies. As the disease is characterized by pulmonary infective episodes, the role of the innate and adaptive immune responses and the interaction of host immunity with the local microbiome will continue to be a major focus of interest, utilising newer research technologies analogous to recent research directions for other complex disorders. Research priorities for bronchiectasis have recently been articulated by a newly formed bronchiectasis network in the UK and are centered on the need for better epidemiologic data, enhanced efforts to help identify the cause of bronchiectasis for the ~50% of patients for whom no (potentially reversible) causative factor is identified, and the requirement for adequately powered and designed randomized clinical trials to address the deficit in robust positive studies of therapeutic interventions for the disease.80 Given the uncommon nature of the disorder, patient registries are highly desirable and are now in recent existence to help further these goals.88, 89 The future is therefore much more hopeful for those now living with bronchiectasis than in any period in the past.",
