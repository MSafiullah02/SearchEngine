In response to the pandemic, many health systems have chosen to restrict access to surgical procedures and reallocate resources in order to create additional short-term hospital capacity [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ; the impact on the provision of surgical services has been profound with more than two million procedures cancelled to date in the UK at a cost of \u00a33bn [8] . Patients will continue to develop a full range of pathologies as the pandemic progresses, continually contributing to the demand for post-pandemic surgical services. Ultimately, this will further exacerbate waiting times, cause preventable morbidity and mortality from surgical disease and adversely affect quality of life. As healthcare systems attempt to regain the initiative, policy makers and administrators must now determine how these systems adapt to meet their elective responsibilities and transition from the current crisis mode of operation back to 'business as usual'. The challenge is to manage patient demand for surgery during all phases of the pandemic whilst ensuring equitable, timely and high-quality care for all. However, no models currently exist that allow policy makers to develop strategies for achieving this goal.",

The principal cause of stroke is carotid territory ischaemia, with up to 15% of all cases attributable to significant carotid artery stenoses [10] . Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is one of the most studied surgical procedures, and there is little controversy regarding its benefit in those with moderate to high-grade stenosis, with up to a 53% relative reduction in stroke risk compared to best medical therapy alone, and with optimal outcomes seen when surgery is performed within two weeks of symptoms [11, 12] . Whilst there is some evidence for a decline in the number of procedures performed annually across the world [13, 14] , carotid endarterectomy remains a relatively common procedure with approximately 4,000 cases performed annually in the United Kingdom [15] . National bodies such as The Vascular Society for Great Britain and Ireland have issued guidance suggesting that surgeons should still try to operate on high risk patients during the pandemic, but that aggressive best medical therapy may be more appropriate [16] ; the impact of COVID-19 on carotid surgery has been hugely significant.",

In addition, it was assumed that at baseline demand matches system capacity. Different scenarios for the capacity to perform carotid endarterectomies were simulated subject to two distinct parameters; the time taken to return to baseline capacity (TTB) and the eventual additional capacity reached above pre-COVID-19 capacity (EC). Capacity is assumed to increase at a constant rate until EC is reached.

The waiting list does not reduce, owing to new demand being equal to the number of cases performed each week. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 400 models simulated with respect to the average time waited for surgery, the time taken for the waiting list to be eliminated and the proportion of patients waiting more than 2 and 12 weeks for surgery is shown. Figure 3A shows that above an EC of 40%, the average time waited for surgery is primarily dictated by the TTB, while for EC of less than 20%, EC is more influential with respect to average waiting time than TTB. For a 20% increase in capacity above baseline, an average waiting time of 12 weeks can only be achieved if pre-COVID-19 baseline capacity is reached in fewer than 10 weeks. Where eventual additional capacity is double pre-COVID-19 baseline capacity, if TTB is 8 weeks, patients would on average wait 4 weeks for surgery. Figure 3B shows the time taken for the additional waiting list to be eroded is more than two years where capacity is increased above pre-COVID-19 baseline capacity by less than 20%, unless capacity is returns to baseline in less than 3 weeks. For capacity increases of 10% or less, the additional waiting list is not eroded completely for at least three years. Even if capacity is doubled, unless baseline capacity is reached within three months, it would take at least a year to erode the additional waiting list as a result of cessation of surgical services.",

            "text": "The cessation of the majority of surgery has had a profound impact on services and will undoubtedly lead to huge increases in patients awaiting intervention as the incidence of nontraumatic surgical pathology is unlikely to change as a result of the pandemic. Whilst the initial priority for policy makers and clinicians was rightly managing the acute phase of the pandemic, the next, and potentially far bigger challenge is determining how and when hospitals return to business as usual in what will be a post-pandemic new normal. This demand modelling scenario has shown that following a 3-month cessation of carotid endarterectomy surgery, if no additional capacity is provided on resumption of normal service the waiting list will not be cleared for over 2 years, and the vast majority of patients would wait >12 weeks for surgery at which point it is of no benefit; exposing them to double the risk of stroke and resulting in the region of 350-1100 additional strokes [11] . Even if surgical capacity is doubled after 1-month of resuming normal service it will still take over 6months to clear the waiting list backlog, 30.8% of patients will not undergo surgery within the 2-week target, and 11.5% will wait more than 12-weeks with an average wait to surgery of External factors may include unpredictable changes in the rate of new stroke diagnoses due to a reduction in the number of patients presenting with acute symptoms during the pandemic; changes which have already been reported across a range of diagnoses including in stroke [18, 19] . This phenomenon will be of even greater importance in diseases with more complex referral and treatment patterns such as gastrointestinal cancer where the majority of patients move between primary care, screening services, diagnostics and hospitals prior to receiving surgery. Additionally, there are going to be inevitable further spikes in COVID-19 cases until either a vaccine is developed or herd immunity is achieved [20] . This will lead to further fluctuations in surgical capacity and successive shut downs over time; it is therefore it is important to meaningfully catch up when excess capacity .

            "text": "In addition to external factors, multiple internal considerations will also influence the ability to increase capacity and catch up with a surgical backlog as highlighted in current capacity planning models [21] . Surgical teams do not operate in isolation, and critical care capacity is vital to support a wide range of surgical procedures including CEA. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a huge increase in demand for critical care capacity that will likely continue into the medium-and long-term [22, 23] , and even before the crisis critical care units typically had occupancy rates of around 80-85% [24, 25] with significant variability in the availability of critical care capacity in relation to surgical activity [26] . Surgical teams can therefore not depend on predictable levels of critical care availability to support an increase in capacity and so will need to plan accordingly or modify peri-operative practice. It is not just critical care capacity that may limit the ability to rapidly expand surgical services. The NHS in England typically runs at general bed occupancy rates of 90-95% [27] , and therefore its ability to rapidly expand surgical numbers is severely limited without seeking alternative infrastructure. Potential options could include the use of the private healthcare sector or transitioning temporary facilities such as the NHS Nightingale Hospitals that were built in response to the COVID-19 crisis to more permanent facilities geared towards reducing waiting lists by providing additional capacity. The most important resource for clearing surgical waiting lists is staff though. Burnout is an increasingly recognised phenomena across all healthcare workers, and especially in those delivering surgical services [28, 29] .",

This would act to reduce the number of patients requiring intervention, and thus the time to return to baseline, but the impact will be minimal; importantly, the model represents the worst-case scenario for which health systems should plan for, and act on.

To address the avoidable burden of stroke, the health implications and costs of these policy decisions could be expressed as incremental gains or losses in quality adjusted life years (QALY).

These patients are added to the list of patients awaiting surgery. Each week, a finite number of patients are taken from this list and undergo surgery. Patients are selected on a 'first come, first served' basis, and so the patients operated on each week are those that have waited longest for surgery. In each model it is assumed that no carotid endarterectomies are performed for three months (13 weeks) due to COVID-19, after which surgery resumes. Throughout this period, new patients continue to require carotid endarterectomies at a constant rate of 74 cases per week. In the model it was assumed that once deemed to require surgery, all patients remained eligible and survived to undergo their procedure irrespective of delay.",

It should also be noted that this modelling technique is not specific to CEA, with delays in surgery from a post-COVID-19 backlog in cases likely to have a direct impact on patients across a wide range of diagnoses. Given these sobering figures hospitals must now start to look forwards and plan for how they can and should manage capacity to ensure they provide equitable, timely and high-quality care for all in the post-COVID-19 recovery phase.Increasing capacity to deal with excess demand is not straight forward, with multiple factors influencing the ability of hospitals to increase the number of surgical procedures performed and clear the post-COVID-19 backlog.",
