As Fig. 1 shows, a user\u2019s interest similarities with his friends vary greatly in different categories of items. When the user needs suggestions on one category, he may refer to friends with strong correlations on that category, and suggestions of friends with strong correlations on other categories are not useful. Therefore, a global scalar indicator used in existing methods cannot express the multifaceted interest correlations between friends. Unfortunately, there exists no explicit evidence to refine social networks into the elaborate correlation, and simply distinguishing items\u2019 categories would make the problem of data sparsity even more serious, which is not conducive to the learning of model parameters.",

We propose to use a correlation vector, instead of a scalar value, to characterize the interest correlation between each pair of friends, and design a dimension-wise attention mechanism with the social network as input to learn it. The correlation vector has the same dimension with user\u2019s embedding, thus can sufficiently capture the high variation in users\u2019 interest correlations on each fine-grained dimension. Moreover, we smooth a user\u2019s embedding by his friends\u2019 embeddings, with the correlation vector into consideration. The combination of the dimension-wise attention mechanism and the smoothing operation can impose strong and delicate unstructured correlations on users\u2019 embeddings while making interactions between users and items. Such an end-to-end framework allow the proposed method to learn the unstructured correlations in a fully data-driven manner.",

Here, we select the baselines which serve as representative works of memory-based and model-based social recommendation methods. The baselines include:SoCF [3]: SoCF is a social-based collaborative filtering method, which recommend friends\u2019 visited items to users.SoReg [11]: SoReg defines individual-based regularization with Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in traditional matrix factorization model. The PCC-version regularization achieves the best performance, compared with other variants, as reported in [11].LOCABAL [17]: LOCABAL takes advantage of both local friends and users with high reputations for social recommendation.PTPMF [22]: PTPMF is a probabilistic matrix factorization model that incorporates the distinction of strong and weak ties.ASMF/ARMF [8]: ASMF and ARMF argument user-item matrix using friends\u2019 visited items as potential items. ASMF optimizes a square-loss based matrix factorization model with potential items being assigned a score lower than a user\u2019s own visited items. ARMF optimizes a ranking-based matrix factorization model which assumes that users\u2019 preference to different items are: visited items > friends\u2019 visited (potential) items > unvisited items.\n\n",

Specifically, among these methods, SoCF is the only memory-based method, which directly recommend friends\u2019 items to users. Performance of SoCF is worse than other model-based methods, which learn users\u2019 and items\u2019 embeddings. SoReg integrates social relations as regularization term in matrix factorization model with feedback-based similarities as regularization coefficients, leading to that friends share similar embeddings. It achieves a good result. Besides social relations as local context, LOCABAL exploits extra social influence, i.e., users with high reputation as global social context. This makes LOCABAL outperform SoReg. PTPMF splits social relations as strong ties and weak ties, and distinguish the different influence of the two types of social ties. We can observe that the differentiation in PTPMF model benefit the recommendation performance. Since ARMF\u2019s performance is better than ASMF, we present ARMF only for comparison. It is observed ARMF is the best baseline method. This may profit from that ARMF introduce friends\u2019 visited items as potential items and it optimizes users\u2019 preference to items in a ranking manner. The proposed method, i.e., DASR, learns rich correlation patterns between users\u2019 interest by a correlation vector and finally beats these baselines.",
