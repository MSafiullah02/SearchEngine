Physical characteristics of inhaled particles and airway mucosal immunity determine which viruses and microbes will persist in the airways. Here we present the first metagenomic study of DNA viral communities in the airways of diseased and non-diseased individuals. We obtained sequences from sputum DNA viral communities in 5 individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 5 individuals without the disease. Overall, diversity of viruses in the airways was low, with an average richness of 175 distinct viral genotypes. The majority of viral diversity was uncharacterized. CF phage communities were highly similar to each other, whereas Non-CF individuals had more distinct phage communities, which may reflect organisms in inhaled air. CF eukaryotic viral communities were dominated by a few viruses, including human herpesviruses and retroviruses. Functional metagenomics showed that all Non-CF viromes were similar, and that CF viromes were enriched in aromatic amino acid metabolism. The CF metagenomes occupied two different metabolic states, probably reflecting different disease states. There was one outlying CF virome which was characterized by an over-representation of Guanosine-59-triphosphate,39-diphosphate pyrophosphatase, an enzyme involved in the bacterial stringent response. Unique environments like the CF airway can drive functional adaptations, leading to shifts in metabolic profiles. These results have important clinical implications for CF, indicating that therapeutic measures may be more effective if used to change the respiratory environment, as opposed to shifting the taxonomic composition of resident microbiota.",

Particle size and the local airway host immune response determine which inhaled viruses and particles will adhere to epithelial surfaces and persist in the airways [1, 2] . The lungs and lower respiratory tract have generally been considered sterile in the absence of respiratory disease although very little is known about the microbiota of the upper and lower airways of nondiseased individuals. Microbes and viruses, including phage, have been implicated in chronic pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis (CF) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, most of this work has been performed using standard microbial cultures and PCR-based studies, which provide an incomplete picture of the airway microbiota and little opportunity for viral discovery compared to metagenomic techniques.",

CF affects paranasal sinuses as well as the lower respiratory, hepatobiliary, pancreatic and lower gastro-intestinal tracts [23] . The current median age of survival for individuals with CF is approximately 38 years. Over 80% of CF mortalities are attributable to respiratory failure from chronic bacterial infections of the lungs, most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia [4, 24] . Individuals with CF have impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) which results in airway mucus plugging [2] [25] [2] . This creates hypoxic microenvironments, forcing invasive microbial species to adapt [2] . This unique airway environment is believed to increase viral replication and susceptibility to viral infections in individuals with CF [8, 22] . Expectorated sputum provides a sample of airway secretions from the proximal airways. Sputum also contains material from the entire respiratory tract including airway mucus, cellular debris, DNA, and degraded proteins as well as microbes, their associated phage, and eukaryotic viruses [26, 27] .",

CF viromes had more tBLASTx similarities to phage genomes overall than Non-CF viromes, and were similar to a wider range of phage ( Figure 1 , Table S2 ). The tBLASTx analysis identified a core set of 19 phage genomes which had similarities to sequences in all metagenomes (Table S3 ). An additional 12 genomes had significant similarities to viromes from all CF individuals but none of the Non-CF individuals. This suggests a core set of phage characteristic of the human respiratory tract, and an additional core group in CF individuals. A few phage genomes appeared to dominated the Non-CF2, Non-CF3, and Non-CF5 viromes when tBLASTx similarities to phage genomes were plotted against the Phage Proteomic Tree (Figure 1 ). Over 90% of tBLASTx hits to phage in Non-CF2 were to Streptococcus phage Cp-1, and 80% of tBLASTx similaritites in Non-CF3 were attributable to two phage, Haemophilus influenza phage HP-1 and Brucella melitensis 16 M BrucI prophage. The large relative abundance of these phage may reflect their prevalence in inhaled air, since environmental air has been shown to contain diverse bacterial communities [29] .",

In CF individuals, phage communities are driven by airway pathology, and correspond to a shared internal respiratory environment. The phage community in the Non-CF4Spouse virome reflects a continuous sampling of CFassociated phage via a shared external environment. Common phage taxonomy in CF individuals and Non-CF1Asthma occurs because of shared respiratory pathology (i.e., similar internal environments). Both CF and asthma are conditions marked by impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) [2, 25, 30] . MCC is slowed in asthma, leading to increased retention of microbes and hence their phage [30] . In CF, mucus is extremely viscous and stagnant, forming obstructive plugs, and creating hypoxic microenvironments that serve as scaffolds for bacterial biofilm formation [2, 25] . Therefore, in both asthma and CF, phage communities are derived from microbes which persist in the airways for longer periods of time than in healthy individuals.",

The higher abundance of Staphylococcus phage in CF is consistent with the increased induction of Staphylococcus prophage by antibiotics in CF individuals, as shown by previous studies [31] . P. aeruginosa was cultured from the sputum of all CF participants, yet Pseudomonas phage were not abundant in the metagenomes. Pseudomonas phage may be of novel types not closely related to those in the database, making them undetectable by tBLASTx. Even if known phage are present, infections of Pseudomonas in CF may be unsuccessful, since phage may not be able to penetrate the biofilm to access susceptible microbial hosts [32] . Alternatively, P. aeruginosa may not be as abundant in the CF airway as indicated by culturing, an idea supported by 16S rDNA and Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of bacteria in CF sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [33] [34] [35] . T-RFLP uses fluorescently labeled 59 PCR primers coupled with restriction digests to allow for rapid profiling of unknown microbial communities, providing a less biased picture of microbial diversity than culture-based studies [35] .",

The estimated number of DNA viral species has been reported to be as low as 1440 in hot springs, and as high as 129,000 in the open ocean [9, 37] . In comparison with other environmental viromes, the respiratory tract viromes had low species richness. Similarly, Rogers et al. [34] found low diversity of Bacteria in CF sputum using T-RFLP analysis. Low species richness probably results from physical and biological barriers to microbial and viral persistence, including both MCC as well as innate and adaptive immunity [2, 38] . Richness may be further depressed in CF individuals because of antibiotic therapies and the metabolic adaptations required for microbial and viral survival in the unique microenvironment of the CF airway [26, 27] .",

These included a mammalian adenovirus (Bovine adenovirus A), eight mammalian herpesviruses, and three poxviruses. Adenoviruses and herpesviruses have been detected in the airways of both CF and Non-CF individuals, and tBLASTx similarities to non-human viruses represent related undiscovered human variants [8] . Several other viruses, such as algal and insect viruses, were shared among all metagenomes, but similarities to these viruses were largely concentrated in one area of the genome. Since metagenomics allows direct sequencing of environmental DNA, metagenomic techniques often isolate novel viruses and microbes. The hallmark of a novel viral genotype is a large concentration of sequences in one discrete region of a previously sequenced genome. Therefore, these results suggest the presence of a novel virus common to all individuals which cannot be identified using database similarities, analogous to viruses detected in human blood [15] . Differences in eukaryotic DNA viral communities in CF versus Non-CF individuals were confirmed by PCA ( Figure 5 ). Non-CF viromes all had nearly identical values for the first and second principal components, resulting in a tight cluster on the graph. This was largely driven by the general absence of ssDNA and Retro-transcribing viruses from Non-CF viromes ( Figure 4A ). Principal components for CF viromes were more variable, reflecting the tendency for CF viromes to have a small number (between one and four) of highly abundant viral species. Specifically, the outlying behavior of CF2 was driven by a high positive loading of the second principal component by the Geminivirus Sugarcane streak Egypt virus. CF4 did not cluster with other metagenomes due to a high negative loading of the first principal component by Reticuloendotheliosis virus.",

This is in contrast to asthma, where the sequelae of viral infections are often severe in the lower respiratory tract, yet individuals are no more likely to acquire such infections [3] .

T-RFLP analysis of bacterial communities demonstrated that sputum is not substantially contaminated by saliva and bacterial flora of the oral cavity [34] . However, the degree to which sputum represents the upper and lower respiratory tract is unknown, especially in healthy individuals. Microbial communities in fecal samples have been shown to differ significantly from those in intestinal mucosal samples, based on 16S rDNA analysis, and similarly, sputum samples may contain different communities than the lung or lower respiratory tract [19] .",

These metagenomes contained over 90% of sequences from human genomic DNA as determined by BLASTn analysis (data not shown). This human DNA comes from neutrophils present in the airway, either through the active dissemination of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) or by the release of cellular contents during cell death [51] . Using the protocol described above, the percent of human DNA detected ranged from 10% to 34% (Table 2 ). This was markedly lower than in the control metagenomes, and was comparable to the percentage of human DNA (24% and 36%) obtained by Allander et al. [16] for viral isolation from pooled nasal aspirate samples. As studies of the human microbiome move away from characterization of microbes using 16S rDNA and towards complete metagenomic analysis of After all contaminating sequences were removed, there were still at least 130,000 sequences comprising over 30 Mbp in all metagenomes. To verify the presence of viruses in the metagenomes, we assembled two metagenomes and compared contigs to the non-redudant database using BLASTn. There were 23 contigs assembled from Non-CF2 which had BLASTn matches to Streptococcus phage Cp-1 (E-value ,10 25 ), with an alignment length greater than 50 bp, and greater than 85% identity ( Figure S4 ). The assembly of the CF3 metagenome yielded high coverage and significant BLASTn hits to the genome of H. influenza prophage Mu ( Figure S5 ).",

However, little work has been done to describe phage communities and DNA viruses associated with CF or with the airways in general [4, 38] .

The non-diseased airway virome contains a set of shared core metabolic functions, which deviate strongly in the face of chronic disease. These deviations are driven by dramatic environmental changes in the airways, induced by the nature of cystic fibrosis, such as the introduction of hypoxic microenvironments and novel carbon sources [26, 27] . In cases where phage taxonomy was shared between Non-CF and CF individuals, metabolic functions still remained distinct. The converse was also true, that is, even when Non-CF viromes differed in phage and eukaryotic viral constituents, they maintained typical Non-CF metabolic profiles. The presence of two alternative metabolic states in CF reflects the heterogenous nature of disease. Though CF is generally considered to be well-characterized, there is still inherent individual variation. The need for alternative therapies for CF is increasing, as microbial antibiotic resistance becomes widespread. The results of this study suggest that CF therapeutics might be better aimed at changing the environment of the airways rather than targeting dominant taxa.",

All volunteers with CF were screened for signs and symptoms of a upper respiratory infection for the thirty days prior to the study. All CF subjects were required to have a well documented diagnosis with either two known mutations in the cystic fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) or an abnormally high sweat chloride test. In addition, all CF patients had Pseudomonas aeruginosa present in their sputum, as determined by culturing in the clinic's microbiology lab. The five CF individuals randomly selected for the study consisted of two males and three females. The age range was from 20 to 35 years and all patients had severe airway obstruction as assessed by standard spirometry (FEV1,50% of predicted). Four Non-CF volunteers were recruited from the campus of San Diego State University, and were subject to the same exclusion criteria for upper respiratory infection. One of these Non-CF individuals had mild asthma controlled by medication. A final Non-CF volunteer was the spouse of a CF patient and was recruited from the greater San Diego area.

To aid in mucus dissolution, samples were incubated with 10 ml of 6.5 mM dithiothreitol (Acros Organics: Morris Plains, New Jersey) for 30 minutes at 37uC. The treated sputum was homogenized using a PowerGen 125 mechanical homogenizer (Fisher Scientific: Hampton, New Hampshire) until it was uniform in color and there was no visible particulate debris. Homogenized samples were filtered through a 0.8 micron black polycarbonate filter (GE Water & Process Technologies: Trevose, Pennsylvania) followed by a 0.45 micron MILLEXHHV filter (Millipore: Carrigtwohill, Colorado) to remove eukaryotic and microbial cells. Viruses in the 0.45 micron filtrate were purified and concentrated using a cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient to remove free DNA and any remaining cellular material [56] . After collection of viral concentrates from the CsCl gradient, the presence of virus-like particles (VLPs) and the absence of microbial contamination were verified by epifluorescence microscopy using SYBRH Gold (Invitrogen: Eugene, Oregon) as described in [56] . Sputum samples from healthy subjects contained approximately 10 7 VLPs per ml, while the samples from CF patients contained approximately 10 9 VLPs per ml. A sample epifluoresence micrograph is shown in Figure S6 . Chloroform was added to the viral concentrates to rupture the membranes of any remaining cells. Following a one hour incubation and centrifugation, choloroform was removed by pipetting. To degrade any remaining free DNA prior to viral DNA extraction, samples were treated with 2 units per ml of Dnase I (Sigma-Aldrich: St. Louis, MO) at 37uC for 1 hour. Viral DNA was isolated using CTAB/phenol:choloroform extractions and amplified using multiple displacement amplification with Phi29 polymerase [56] . Viral DNA was sequenced at 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT) using the GSFLX pyrosequencing platform to produce ten total viral metagenomic libraries. The ten viral metagenomes are accessible from NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.gov) under the genome project ID 39545.",
