Pregnant women were also reported being infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), which possesses similarity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As reported by the previous SARS\u2010related studies, pregnant women were more susceptible to coronavirus infection and at a high risk of poor perinatal outcomes.\n3\n, \n4\n Nevertheless, studies on COVID\u201019 are still quite limited, leading to a great challenge for pregnant women care. Our study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of pregnant women infected with COVID\u201019, and we hope this study could provide a guidance for clinical prevention and treatment of COVID\u201019 in pregnant women.",

All patients were regularly given a prenatal routine examination that started from the first trimester. Ultrasound examination and fetal heart monitoring were offered regularly before delivery, no symptoms of viral pneumonia were observed. On latest admission, all patients received routine fetal heart monitoring and laboratory examinations including complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes, C\u2010reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The delivery strategy is determined according to the pregnant women's general situation. Apgar scoring and nursing was routinely given for the newborn after delivery. Once the patient had suspected symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) scan and other blood analysis were instantly performed, antibiotics were empirically given in time to prevent bacterium\u2010related infection, patients were quarantined for an intensive treatment, and newborns were closely monitored with breastfeeding restriction. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province, the work undertaken in this study conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in Tokyo 2004). Informed consent was obtained from all pregnant women.",

As reported by a recent newspaper, a newborn was diagnosed as COVID\u201019 30 hours after delivery, which suggested that there may be a risk of virus intrauterine vertical transmission or infection through contact with the maternal secretion. However, another research including nine pregnant women showed no direct evidence of intrauterine infection,\n12\n which was consistent with the research on pregnant women with SARS,\n13\n therefore, we need to be alert to take preventive and treatment measures for newborns in such period. According to China experts\u2019 consensus, it is recommended to quarantine the infants whose mother is suspected or diagnosed with COVID\u201019 for 14 days. Currently, there is not enough evidence supporting the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in breast milk, however, breastfeeding is not recommended according to the experience from SARS.\n4\n\n",

The pregnant women's exposure to CT radiation barely reaches the dose that causes harm to the fetus,\n14\n so it is plausible to perform a COVID\u201019 screening during early pregnancy.
