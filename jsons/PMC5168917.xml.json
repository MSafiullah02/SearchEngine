Chart records of patients with simple (dystrophic) congenital ptosis who were followed for \u22656 months postoperatively were included in the study. The study was conducted with approval from the Institutional Review Board. All surgeries were performed by or under direct supervision of a single surgeon. For all patients, data from the initial examination and the last postoperative visit were analyzed. The follow-up time was defined as the time between the final surgery and the most recent examination. For each examination LF, MRD1, ocular ductions, Bell phenomenon, and lid-lag were recorded when present. All subjects enrolled in the study had to have LF and MRD1 values. Either a modified Fox-Pentagon technique or an anterior approach levator resection was used for surgical corrections. LF was accepted as the gold standard parameter to differentiate between the surgical interventions. A successful outcome was defined as a MRD1 of \u22653 mm at the final postoperative visit. For study subjects included in this study, levator resection was performed on patients with LF >4 mm technique and frontalis suspension was performed on patients with LF \u22644 mm. Only the data of patients who achieved surgical success were included in the study as it was presumed that appropriate surgical procedure had been utilized in this group. Patients with unsatisfactory outcomes were excluded from the study. Patients with a history of any previous ocular or eyelid surgery, synkinetic movements of the upper lid and strabismus at first examination or during follow-up were excluded from the study. In addition, patients with Marcus-Gunn phenomenon and blepharophimosis syndrome in whom frontalis suspension technique is already indicated were excluded from the study. The optimum cutoff point for the preoperative MRD1 between patients who performed frontalis suspension and levator resection surgery was determined as the point at which sensitivity and specificity was highest at the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the selection of surgical procedure.",

Of these, 42 had right eye (46.7%), 31 had left eye (34.4%), and 17 had bilateral (18.9%) involvement. Levator resection technique was used in 46 eyes of 45 patients (44.7%) and frontalis suspension technique in 57 eyes of 45 patients (55.3%). Of the 57 eyes which underwent frontalis suspension, 37 received autogenous fascia lata (64.9%), and 20 received allograft fascia lata (35.1%). There was a positive linear correlation between the LF and MRD1 at first examination (P < 0.001, r = 0.458) [Fig. 1]. The average MRD1 was 0.4 \u00b1 1.1 mm at preoperative examination and 3.2 \u00b1 0.4 mm at the last postoperative examination (P < 0.001) [Figs. 2 and 3]. The optimum cutoff point for MRD1 to differentiate between the appropriate surgical intervention was determined as 0.5 mm. Patients whose initial MRD1 was <0.5 mm fared better when frontalis suspension was used. On the other hand, patients whose initial MRD1 was \u22650.5 mm fared better when levator resection was used. At the cutoff MRD1 of 0.5 mm, the sensitivity was 71%, and specificity was 86% according to the ROC. When the optimum cutoff point of 0.5 mm was used at which the highest sensitivity and specificity for the selection of appropriate surgical technique was attained, the area under the curve that represented the discriminative power of this parameter was found to be 0.826 [Fig. 4].",

However, the determination of LF needs a voluntary movement of the eyelid, and in children younger than 4-year-old and patients with mental disorders, LF is often difficult to assess.[141516] It is possible to estimate the excursion by watching the patient from a distance and observing eye and lid elevation, frontal contraction as well as the lid crease position. Patients with excessive frontal contraction and discreet or absent lid crease generally have poor LF.[14] To overcome this challenge in young and cooperative patients, special ptosis assessment spectacles have been designed to this effect and with high reproducibility and reliability, but they have not received widespread acceptance in clinics.[17] For assessment of LF more objectively, slit-lamp mounted digital photography system with computerized eyelid measurement analysis have also been proposed.[1819] Again, these methods lack the ease of use in preschool children. Thus, it is evident that an unmet need exists for an objective, quantifiable, and easily assessable clinical parameter to determine the appropriate surgery selection.",

The normal value ranges between around 4.0 and 4.5 mm.[20] The MRD1 is the most important measurement in clinical practice to determine the presence of blepharoptosis. In severe cases, values of zero or less may be present.[14] Since the determination of MRD1 does not need a voluntary movement, its measurement is more objective and easier to obtain than LF. MRD1 is also used to grade the severity of ptosis as mild, moderate, and severe.[14] Our study and prior studies in the literature demonstrates that MRD1 is correlated with LF.[21] In general, mild ptosis is associated with good LF (>8 mm), moderate ptosis with fair LF (5\u20137 mm), and severe ptosis with poor LF (1\u20134 mm).[22232425] Thus, a relation already exists between MRD1 and LF and these parameters are interdependent.",

            "text": "Cetinkaya and Brannan evaluated the findings of the previous studies on surgical correction of blepharoptosis and proposed an algorithm for appropriate surgical selection with utilization of LF and MRD1 parameters in their study.[33] According to that study, the traditional approach is to use frontalis suspension procedures with poor LF and prefer alternative methods depending on MRD1 in eyes with considerably better LFs. It is also emphasized in that study that the amount of LF usually corresponds to the severity of ptosis and is the major determinant of surgical approach.[33] As such, there does not appear to be a clear consensus on the role of alternative clinical parameters (apart from LF) used in surgery selection for treatment of blepharoptosis. The results of our study suggest that MRD1 may be used as a secondary parameter to determine the surgical approach in patients with congenital blepharoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a similar published study looking into the value of MRD1 using ROC methodology to determine the appropriate surgical intervention. It is our opinion that our findings are important as this is the initial study demonstrating the discriminative power of MRD1 inappropriate surgery selection and which determines the objective and quantitative cut-off point for MRD1 as a clinical parameter.",
