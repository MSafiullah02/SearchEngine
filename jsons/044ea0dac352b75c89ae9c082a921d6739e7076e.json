Although the common cold is a self-limited infection, there are no effective treatments presently available and complications, missed time from work and school, and overall discomfort are not insignificant. Understanding how infections are transmitted may lead to interventions to reduce rates of infection. In order to establish a route of transmission, certain conditions must be met. The virus must be produced and shed at the site of infection. The virus must be deposited in the environment and be able to survive there. The virus must then be able to reach the portal of entry. Finally, interruption of the proposed route of transmission must reduce the incidence of infection under natural conditions. Applying this framework, there is clear evidence in both experimental and home settings that colds can be transmitted via self-inoculation. A small amount of evidence is available relating to large and small particle aerosol transmission. Because rhinovirus is responsible for half of all colds, it has been used as the model to understand how virus is transmitted from one person to another in experimental settings. Rhinovirus has been shown to infect via self-inoculation following hand-to-hand contact with contaminated hands or hand-to-surface contact with contaminated objects in the environment. Similarly, there is convincing evidence that the self-inoculation method of cold virus transmission occurs in the home environment, where colds are most often transmitted. Aerosol transmission has been studied in the experimental setting and may provide another, albeit less common, method for transmission of rhinovirus infection. As more is understood about the transmission of cold viruses, effective methods to interrupt transmission may be devised.",

Subsequently, rhinovirus infection may spread anteriorly to infect the nasal mucosa [3] . Rhinovirus replication occurs in only a small number of nasal epithelial cells, as demonstrated by studies using in situ hybridization of nasal biopsy specimens [4, 5] . Rhinovirus can be recovered from nasal secretions of infected individuals for 5-7 days, but viral shedding in the nasopharynx may persist for 2-3 weeks [3] .

Large particle aerosols, such as the large droplets of saliva expelled during a sneeze, would have to land directly on the eyes or nose, or on a surface to be picked up on the hands for self-inoculation to transmit infection (Fig. 2) .

According to this algorithm, the virus must be produced and shed at the site of infection, it must be deposited in the environment and able to survive there, and it must be able to reach the portal of entry, namely the eyes or nose for rhinovirus. Finally, to establish that viral transmission actually occurs via a route, interruption of the proposed route must reduce the incidence of infection. This review focuses on deposition of virus in the environment, transfer of virus to the portal of entry, and interruption of transmission. Virus must be deposited in the environment and able to survive (Tab. 2) Rhinovirus has been found on the hands of about 40% of naturally infected individuals [7] . From the hands, rhinovirus may be transmitted directly to another person's hand or be deposited on a surface by an infected individual where it may survive for several days [8] . In one study, 35% of surfaces tested in hotel rooms used by adults infected with rhinovirus were contaminated with rhinovirus RNA, including door handles, pens, light switches, TV remote controls, faucets, and telephones [8] . Rhinovirus has been recovered with cell culture for 3 hours after deposit on non-porous surfaces such as plastic, formica, stainless steel, and certain hard synthetic fabrics, but it was not recovered from porous materials such as tissues or cotton cloth after 3 hours [9] .",

In another air sample study, picornavirus RNA was detected in 32% of air sampling filters from three office buildings, and the frequency of viral detection correlated with the amount of outside ventilation employed [14] . In a natural setting, there was no evidence that recirculation of air during commercial plane flights increased the risk for cold symptoms in passengers [15] . In a study of rhinovirus infection in insurance company employees working in a large room, it was found that rhinoviruses did not circulate well at work [16] . Finally, evaluation of simulated sneezes and coughs of adults with natural rhinovirus colds showed that rhinovirus could be recovered from only 1/13 sneezes and 0/8 coughs [9] ; neither of these aerosol-producing behaviors were effective in producing rhinovirus-laden aerosols. A more recent study, using a mask placed closely over the nose and mouth, demonstrated the presence of rhinovirus RNA by PCR analysis after coughing, talking, and breathing, but this may have been due to close contact with the mask and not necessarily due to aerosolization [17] .",

Cold viruses in temperate climates move through the community in a predictable and orderly fashion. It begins with an increase in rhinovirus in September after the children return to school. Late October and November herald the onset of parainfluenza, followed by RSV and coronaviruses in the winter months. Influenza peaks in late winter, and rhinovirus has a secondary peak thereafter, while adenovirus remains constant throughout. Because these cold viruses occur in the community at different times, environmental conditions and population characteristics (school attendance, crowding indoors) may affect the survival of these viruses in the environment and their subsequent transmission [19] . In summary, rhinovirus is commonly present on the hands of infected individuals and on the objects that they use in daily activities and can be readily transferred from hands and objects to the hands of susceptible hosts, thus providing a readily available method of rhinovirus transfer from one person to another. Rhinovirus may be present in aerosols, but the frequency of expulsion of viable virus into the air with coughs and sneezes is not clear. Likewise, RSV may be present on surfaces and transmit infection to susceptible individuals following deliberate self-inoculation, but not via small particle aerosol. Other factors, such as human behavior and climate, may also play a role in cold virus survival and transmission.",

They were exposed to infected individuals while playing poker. Five of six restrained players were infected, compared to 6/6 control volunteers who were unrestrained [22] . They then placed arm-braces on volunteers as another method of interrupting transmission via self-inoculation and found that only 1/6 of the restrained volunteers became infected, compared with 5/6 of the unrestrained volunteers.

Interruption of the proposed route of transmission must reduce the incidence of infection Only 8% of uninfected volunteers became infected after exposure across a small table to rhinovirus-infected individuals who were singing, coughing, sneezing, and talking loudly; when separated by a greater distance, none became infected [23] In volunteers playing poker with rhinovirus infected individuals, 67% of those volunteers with restraints to prevent self-touching of the eyes and nose became infected, compared to 56% of unrestrained volunteers [22] In volunteers whose hands were pretreated with iodine who had hand-to-hand contact with the contaminated hands of rhinovirus-infected donors and who then touched their own eyes and nose, 60% of the untreated volunteers became infected while only 10% of the iodine treated volunteers became infected; furthermore, rhinovirus could be recovered from the hands of only 11% of the iodine-treated group, compared with 40% of the untreated group [11] Rhinovirus suspended in cell culture media passed through commercial tissues 26/27 times, but passed through only 1/18 times when the tissues were treated with a combination of malic acid, citric acid, and lauryl sulfate [24] 83% of those who blew their nose without a tissue had rhinovirus recovered from their hands, compared with 42% of those using commercial tissues, and only 3% of those using treated tissues (malic acid, citric acid, and lauryl sulfate) [25] Rhinovirus was transferred to fingertips of recipients after brief contact with donor fingers which were contaminated with virus from 95% of donors who used no tissue to blow their nose, from 27% of those who used commercial tissues and from 0% of those who used treated tissues; likewise, 50% of the recipients in the no-tissue group became infected after touching their own eyes and nose, compared with 13% of those in the commercial tissue group and 0% of those in the treated tissue group [25] virus was recovered from 10/25 (40%) of the hand rinses from the control group and from only 3/27 (11%) of hand rinses from the iodine-treated group.

In the experimental setting, interruption of self-inoculation by treatment of the hands of the recipient with iodine to impair the infectivity of rhinovirus is effective in decreasing both transfer from hand to hand and infection after deliberate self-inoculation [11] . Determining how to interrupt transmission in the home setting is a more difficult proposition. In the best evaluation to date [7] , careful definitions of exposure, respiratory infection, and secondary infection were employed to evaluate transmission in the home. Application of 2% aqueous iodine to the fingertips of mothers was tested as a means of interrupting transmission to reduce secondary infection in the mothers in the home. Mothers were instructed to apply 2% aqueous iodine or brown placebo to their fingertips upon awakening and every 3-4 hours thereafter at the onset of respiratory symptoms in a family member. A respiratory infection was defined as either two respiratory symptoms occurring on the same day or one symptom occurring on two consecutive days. A secondary case (in the mother) was defined as respiratory symptoms beginning at least 2 days and not more than 7 days after onset of respiratory symptoms in the index case. The study was conducted in the fall over 4 years; in the iodine-treated mothers, 6-8% of exposures resulted in secondary illness, compared with 15-26% in the control group. When the results from all 4 years were combined, only 4/58 (7%) of exposures in the iodine-treated group resulted in infection, compared with 16/79 (20%) in the control group [7] . When the results were adjusted for maternal immunity to rhinovirus, only 4/32 (12.5%) of the iodine-treated mothers experienced secondary infection, compared to 16/44 (36%) of the control group. This small study provides convincing evidence that the interruption of self-inoculation can decrease transmission in the home environment. The practical application of this method of interruption of transmission is limited, however, as iodine applied to the hands is drying and stains the hands brown.",

The use of aqueous iodine and of virucidal tissues has been shown to reduce secondary illness when used in the home environment. The use of alcohol-based hand gels did not reduce the rate of secondary respiratory illness in the home. Because alcohol does not inactivate rhinovirus (responsible for up to 50% of colds) this result does not disprove self-inoculation as the predominant method of transmission; aerosol transmission provides an alternative explanation. Interruption of aerosol transmission has not been attempted either in experimental settings or in the home environment.",

Interruption studies in the home environment utilizing iodine and virucidal tissues have demonstrated a decrease in secondary transmission consistent with self-inoculation as a method of cold virus transmission in the home. Interruption of transmission via aerosols has not been studied. Prevention of secondary transmission may be the most effective means of reducing the misery of the common cold. It seems likely that effective and practical methods of interruption of transmission of colds in the home can be developed.",
