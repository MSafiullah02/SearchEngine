However, the sophistication of these interactions has only begun to be revealed. Even by the late nineteenth century, it was established knowledge that human and animal health have many commonalities; an insight that more recently led to the term \u2018One Medicine', coined in 1984 to integrate human and veterinary health and research. In 2003, after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, One Medicine evolved into the concept of \u2018One Health', which expands the idea beyond a focus on the health of animals and humans to include health service delivery, environmental health and ecosystem services (for further reading, see Sidebar A). It defines \u2018health' as a broader concept, whereby humans, animals and the environment are inextricably linked and where each need equal attention to ensure optimal health for all. Although it is an interesting and forward-looking concept, One Health has unfortunately not gained significant attention, particularly in the area of human health.",

The common host of this protozoan is the domestic cat (Felidae), in which the sexual part of the parasite's life cycle takes place (Fig 1). However, T. gondii can infect many other warm-blooded species, from humans to birds, and has become endemic in many areas. Estimates put the number of infected humans at about 500 million, with large regional differences. Although toxoplasmosis is not usually a deadly disease, the infection does have some unpleasant side effects for many species, including its ability to modify the behaviour of rats and mice, making them drawn to, rather than fearful of, the scent of cats\u2014probably a survival strategy for a parasite that requires cats to sexually reproduce (Sidebar A). In humans, toxoplasmosis during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and severe health effects if it infects the fetus, and it has been associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia in adults.",

Felid hosts shed Toxoplasma oocysts with their faeces into the environment, including into water systems, from which the parasite infects other species. The main routes of infection for humans are thought to be direct contact with cats and eating undercooked meat from infected sheep. However, infection could also occur through water and contaminated vegetable or fruit produce. In California, for instance, increased mortality among sea otters has been linked to the pollution of fresh water systems by T. gondii. The prevalence of T. gondii infections among humans is therefore one result of the fact that most people on the planet do not have access to clean water. However, even in developed countries, a significant number of people are infected. One might ask whether this is a serious issue, because few people infected with T. gondii have to be clinically treated. However, T. gondii and its effects are subtle: the organism might lie dormant in the host and become active many years later, and it can cause a range of clinical problems from ocular degeneration to neurological and behavioural changes (Sidebar A). As there is no reliable drug or therapy that can clear the parasite from the patient, it puts the onus on developing and implementing preventive measures.\u2026a broader concept, whereby humans, animals and the environment are inextricably linked and where each need equal attention to ensure optimal health for all",

One of the oldest pathogens shared between Homo sapiens and cattle is the tuberculosis-causing Mycobacterium, which might have originated in humans. Although different strains of the bacteria affect cattle (M. bovis) and humans (M. tuberculosis), the pathogens are still capable of jumping back and forth. Humans experience zoonotic tuberculosis from infected animals, and animals can be infected by humans (anthropozoonotic tuberculosis; Sidebar A).

As such, humans constitute an invasive species that causes ecosystem change, either directly by destroying pristine areas such as the rainforests, or indirectly by causing global climate change, and through global trade and travel.

When discussing and applying the concept of One Health, it is therefore important not to limit the focus to humans or infectious diseases. Pathogens are also an important factor for species loss (Sidebar A), although most cases probably involve more than one cause. Conversely, biodiversity loss affects disease ecology (Sidebar A). Disease can change the composition and distribution of species in ecosystems. A good example is rinderpest, which affected the African savannah landscape with consequences that are still felt more than a century later, such as the balance between grassland and bush, and the change in distribution of the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis. It can also influence land use by humans spatially or temporally\u2014for instance, trypanosomiasis and foot-and-mouth disease have effects on agriculture and its impact on ecosystems in affected areas.",

If this hypothesis is correct, then it is perhaps not surprising that we see a rapid increase in inflammatory disease with increasing urbanization and ongoing loss of biodiversity.

This disease, or rather group of diseases, is caused by a plethora of influenza A viruses, which are classified according to their surface antigens. They are further subdivided into highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains, referring to their ability to cause disease in domestic chickens. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza have occurred on every continent because wild birds, in particular water-birds, that migrate vast distances and mix together with domestic birds at seasonal breeding and feeding grounds are an important reservoir of the disease. Wild birds are usually asymptomatic carriers of a low pathogenic virus, which on contact with local birds, including domestic poultry, can mutate into a highly pathogenic strain. However, avian influenza strains can cause mass mortalities among wild bird populations, such as in South Africa in 1961, when the virus decimated the local population of common terns in the Cape Province.The social aspect requires delicate handling in this era of social alienation, in which many humans are emotionally dependent on pets such as cats",

In fact, avian influenza viruses can infect all mammalian species, not just humans, which creates new reservoirs for the virus and increases the threat of an epizootic for many species.

Poultry trade and consumption drops worldwide when an outbreak of avian influenza is reported anywhere. Thus, we must establish the appropriate trade-off between effective control measures that protect human and animal health and the economic damage they cause, which will cause direct harm to people and indirect harm to the environment. Furthermore, control strategies only work when they are fully supported and implemented by the affected communities. Eradication of flocks or pets might prompt the illegal movement of animals, further spreading the disease. Some farmers might believe that culling wild birds will protect their livestock.

Environmental microbes therefore influence susceptibility to psychiatric disorders, as described above with T. gondii. These examples come from animal studies, but the insights can be extended to human health. For instance, humans who have had antibiotic treatments in early life have an increased risk of asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. In mice, this is apparently caused by increased susceptibility to environmental triggers, owing to a reduction of natural killer T cells.

Such a shift in thinking also has consequences for how we conduct and organize research, in particular in the life sciences. Traditionally, researchers have taken a reductionist, hypothesis-driven approach to understanding biological systems and worked in small research groups to tackle one problem at a time. It is unlikely that this approach lends itself to the analysis of whole ecosystems and to applying the concept of One Health as outlined in this article. However, as more discoveries are made and more information becomes available, there is a tendency towards specialization. This sends the scientific community in the opposite direction from the One Health movement. A different strategy is needed, whereby interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, more systems studies and ultimately larger projects tackle more complex biological systems and their dynamics, as it is highly unlikely that complex webs can be described by simple relationships between a small set of variables.
