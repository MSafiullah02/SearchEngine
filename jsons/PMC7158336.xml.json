Abiotrophies, disorders of premature neuronal degeneration, and other degenerative diseases affecting the axons and myelin can manifest signs within a few months or late in life. These disorders are often insidious and progressive. However, some diseases such as the storage and myelin disorders can have an acute onset once the neuron or myelin reaches a critical threshold of dysfunction.",

Early in the disease course, neuronal cell body diseases often can be differentiated from demyelinating diseases. Proprioceptive positioning is commonly affected in demyelinating diseases but is rarely involved in the early stages of neuronal disease. Neuronal cell body, diseases (storage disease, abiotrophy) are more likely to have forebrain or cerebellar involvement. Axonal and myelin diseases of the sensory and motor tracts of the spinal cord are more likely to have general proprioceptive (GP) ataxia and paresis of an upper motor neuron (UMN) type. If the nerve or neuronal cell body is involved, signs of LMN weakness predominate. Weakness is not a predominant feature of pure demyelinating or cerebellar disorders. However, limb and whole body tremor is a feature of myelin and cerebellar diseases.",

The effects of the disease may be caused by the accumulation of the product or may be a direct result of the metabolic disturbance.1 Because the clinical signs and the progression of the disease depend on the pathologic process, many of the conditions present in a similar fashion with multifocal CNS signs and sometimes also with peripheral neuropathy. Two groups are commonly recognized: neuronal storage diseases, in which the product accumulates in neurons, and leukodystrophies.2 In general, leukodystrophy refers to inherited conditions of younger animals in which myelin synthesis or function is defective and cannot be maintained and may include storage disease pathogenesis. Globoid cell leukodystrophy is a storage disease caused by a deficiency of galactocerebroside activity, resulting in intracellular accumulation of a metabolite toxic to myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells (Figure 15-2\n).",

Animals are usually normal at birth, but they fail to grow normally. Signs typically occur within the first few months of life but may be delayed until adulthood with some conditions such as some of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.5 Many of the storage disorders affect multiple organs and regions of the nervous system. Others affect only the myelin and only neurologic signs occur. Often neurologic signs include cerebellar ataxia, myelopathy, and encephalopathy. Cerebellar signs are often the first sign of storage diseases because of the complex integration of the fast conducting sensory and motor pathways (see Chapter 8).4 The cerebellum also is particularly sensitive to disorders affecting myelin. Seizure events that occur with some storage disorders usually manifest at the end stage of the disease process. Storage disorders for which seizure activity is a predominant clinical feature include ceroid lipofuscinosis, glycoproteinoses, and leukodystrophies.4\n",

The general somatic efferent system is not affected except for involvement of the anal sphincter. Dysautonomia was first recognized in horses in Scotland (grass sickness) and then described in cats in the United Kingdom and Europe in the early 1980s.15., 16. Dysautonomia was first described in dogs from southwest Missouri and Wyoming in 1988 and continues to be reported in Missouri and surrounding states.17., 18., 19. The etiology is still unknown but a toxico-infectious etiology resulting from Clostridium botulinum type CD has been proposed in horses. Acute or subacute autonomic neuropathy of people is similar to the animal forms and studies suggest an immune-mediated basis for this disease.",

Many affected dogs are from rural environments but the disease has been documented in dogs maintained strictly in kennel environments. The peak incidence in Missouri is from late winter to early spring. The following clinical signs develop and are progressive over 2 to 3 weeks. All signs may not be present in all dogs.\u2022Dysuria, distended urinary bladder: The pelvic nerve is a parasympathetic nerve that innervates the detrusor muscle. Detrusor muscle dysfunction is a common finding.\u2022Mydriasis and absent pupillary light reflexes: Pupillary constriction is a function of the parasympathetic fibers contained in the oculomotor nerves.\u2022Elevated third eyelid: This sign is present in about 50% of cases, suggesting some dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system.\u2022Dry mucous membranes, decreased tear production: Dry mouth, nose, and eyes are common findings. Secretions are largely the function of the parasympathetic nervous system.\u2022Vomiting, regurgitation: Megaesophagus is a common finding. The vagus nerve (parasympathetic) innervates the esophagus and stomach and plays a major role in esophageal and gastric motility.\u2022Decreased anal (perineal) reflex: The external anal sphincter is innervated by the pudendal nerve, a general somatic efferent nerve. This is the only sign of somatic dysfunction.\u2022Intestinal ileus: Distention of the intestinal tract is a less common finding.

Although myasthenia gravis and botulism cause some of these signs, the presence of weakness in the skeletal muscles is not observed in dysautonomia. One of the best clinical procedures for confirming dysautonomia is to demonstrate denervation hypersensitivity to the pupils. Pilocarpine ophthalmic solution (1%) is diluted to a concentration of 0.05% with normal saline. One to two drops are placed in one eye and the pupils are observed every 15 minutes. Dogs with dysautonomia have rapid pupillary constriction compared with normal dogs who either do not respond at all or show delayed responses. If no response is seen in 90 minutes, the test is repeated with 1% pilocarpine. Unless parasympatholytic drugs (atropine) or toxins are present, rapid pupillary constriction should occur. Lack of innervation causes an upregulation of the postsynaptic receptors with denervation supersensitivity in neurotransmission.",

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in certain plants such as Senecio spp. and Crotalaria spp. cause parenchymal liver damage and hepatic encephalopathy in herbivores. Parenchymal disease severely reduces the capacity of the liver to perform its normal metabolic functions. Portosystemic venous shunts divert a significant portion of the portal blood past the liver into the vena cava. Potentially toxic substances that normally are absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and detoxified in the liver enter the systemic circulation. Similar to portosystemic venous shunting, the pathophysiology in microvascular dysplasia involves shunting of portal blood into the systemic circulation but occurs within the liver vasculature on a microscopic level.

Depending on the experience of the operator, abdominal US has a sensitivity of about 80% and a specificity of about 65% for the detection of extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (PSS). The sensitivity for detection of intrahepatic shunts is nearly 100%.28 Radiocolloid scintigraphy using technetium-99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) is used to evaluate liver size and shape.

Conditions that have been recognized include bovine ketosis (acetonemia) and pregnancy toxemia of cattle, sheep, and goats. Unlike most monogastric animals, ruminants produce most of their glucose supplies from the gluconeogenesis of volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, and butyric acids). Nearly 50% of the glucose in a cow is normally derived from dietary propionic acid that is converted to glucose in the gluconeogenic pathway. Reduction of propionic acid production in the rumen can result in hypoglycemia and the subsequent mobilization of free fatty acids and glycerol from fat stores. The liver has a limited ability to use these fatty acids because the levels of oxaloacetate are low. Acetyl coenzyme A therefore is not incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is converted into the ketone bodies acetoacetate and \u00df-hydroxybutyrate. When the production of ketones by the liver exceeds peripheral use, pathologic ketosis results.",

Similar tests and measurement of increased plasma ACTH concentrations are useful in the diagnosis of equine Cushing disease.58 Abdominal US may also be helpful in the diagnosis of adrenal gland disease. Macroadenomas can be accurately diagnosed with MRI or CT.59 In dogs, pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is usually treated medically with mitotane or trilostane.60 Mitotane causes necrosis of the adrenal cortex, primarily the zona fasciculata and reticularis, and results in markedly decreased cortisol production. If the dosage is carefully monitored, aldosterone secretion is much less affected. Side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, and depression. Trilostane reduces synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens. It also can be used in dogs, cats, and horses for pituitary and adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. It is well tolerated and has fewer side effects than mitotane. However, it may not produce long-term control of clinical signs. Readers are encouraged to consult internal medicine textbooks or veterinary drug handbooks for dosages and correct regimens for each drug. In dogs and cats with pituitary macrotumors, treatment also is directed at control of the pituitary mass (see Chapter 12). Adrenalectomy is recommended for adrenocortical neoplasia.",

Serum insulin levels should be measured when the blood glucose concentrations are below 60 mg/dL. Normal or increased serum insulin concentrations in hypoglycemic dogs are strongly suggestive of insulinoma. An amended insulin:glucose ratio greater than 30 is supportive of an insulinoma. The glucagon tolerance test may be used as an alternative procedure, but it carries a greater risk of profound hypoglycemia during the test. Abdominal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI may detect pancreatic masses in some cases and help localize the lesion for surgical resection.",

Symptomatic treatment with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone, given at a dosage of 0.25 to 0.50 mg/kg per day, help to normalize the blood glucose concentration because of their antiinsulin effects. Streptozotocin is effective in dogs with even metastatic disease. Concurrent saline diuresis should be given to prevent renal toxicity.

Stimulation of the cholinergic neurotransmission will result in bronchoconstriction, muscle tremors, exocrine gland stimulation, bradycardia, and other CNS effects. Toxins may exert effects at the neuromuscular junction through increased release of acetylcholine and increased receptor stimulation and subsequent muscular fatigue. Blockade of cholinergic neurotransmission depends upon the type of cholinergic receptor involved. Muscarinic receptor blockade causes CNS depression.

The term tetanus is associated with the toxic effects of Clostridium tetani. Tetanus is much slower in onset than is strychnine poisoning and generally causes more continuous contraction of the muscles.

P-glycoprotein plays an important neuroprotective role in the blood-brain barrier in that it enhances the transport of drugs from the CSF back into circulation. Ivermectin is a GABA agonist that inhibits activity at presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the CNS. Clinical signs of ivermectin neurotoxicity include depression, disorientation, tremors, ataxia, blindness, mydriasis, retinopathy, seizures, and coma.104., 105., 106., 107. Clinical signs are dose dependent in that susceptible breeds rarely develop clinical signs at 6 \u03bcg/kg once a month, which is the standard dose for heartworm prevention. Doses exceeding 200 \u03bcg/kg may cause clinical signs in susceptible breeds and doses above 400 \u03bcg/kg may cause death.105 The recovery period may take more than 3 weeks. There is no specific anecdote for ivermectin toxicity. Three adult horses developed neurologic signs 18 hours after oral administration of ivermectin paste.108 Signs included depression, ataxia, drooping of the lips, mydriasis, decreased pupillary light reflexes, absent menace responses and muscle fasciculations.

In cattle and sheep, the organism penetrates the oral mucosa via wounds and is transmitted to the brain in a retrograde fashion via the trigeminal nerve. Signs related to infection of the rostral medulla (trigeminal, facial, and vestibulocochlear nerve dysfunction) are common. Although meningitis and encephalitis are the classic manifestations of listeriosis in ruminants, spinal cord disease, abortion, and mastitis also occur. Clinical signs of encephalitis are often more severe in small ruminants. The most useful antemortem diagnostic test is CSF analysis. Characteristic findings include increased protein concentration and nucleated cell count with mononuclear cells predominating. Definitive diagnosis is made by histopathology. Gross necropsy findings are not very remarkable. Histopathology reveals multifocal areas of necrosis with infiltrations of macrophages and neutrophils. Diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the organism from body fluids or tissues. Warm or cold enrichment methods are used to isolate the organism but immunohistochemistry is more successful than bacteriologic culture for detecting L. monocytogenes in brain tissue.

A variety of clinical signs may occur, including uveitis, retinitis, myositis, pneumonia, and encephalitis. The diagnosis of clinically active toxoplasma infection is based on suggestive clinical signs, demonstration of T. gondii tachyzoites or bradyzoites in tissue biopsy sections, or immune testing for antibodies or antigen in serum, ocular fluid, or CSF. Although several immunologic tests are commercially available, the T. gondii-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are most often used in dogs and cats. IgM levels tend to increase within 2 to 4 weeks of infection but are negative by 16 weeks.168 IgM titers more than 1:256 indicate recent or active infection. A fourfold increase in IgG titers also indicates recent or active disease. Both IgG and IgM titers can be assessed in samples of CSF and compared with serum concentrations of albumin, IgG, and IgM.

The causative agents are single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses, Alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. Birds are involved in application of the disease. Susceptible horses, usually younger, show clinical signs 2 to 3 weeks after viral infection of birds. Times for peak infection are June to August in the southern states and September in the northern states. The clinical signs include mild to severe pyrexia, anorexia, stiffness, propulsive walking, depression, hyperesthesia, aggression, and excitability.179 Obtundation is the most common clinical sign and seizures occur in one third of the cases. Neurologic signs are variable and occur as diffuse or multifocal forebrain disease with brainstem and spinal cord involvement. The signs are peracute to acute in onset and progressive. Mortality rates are highest with EEE. Histopathology reveals gray matter predominance with multifocal to diffuse meningoencephalomyelitis. Diagnosis is made via serology (CF, HI, SN, and IgM capture ELISA). Results of CSF analysis are distinctive and reveal very high protein concentrations and severe neutrophilic pleocytosis. Treatment is mostly supportive care, which includes corticosteroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and physical therapy. Long-term antiinflammatory therapy may be important for neurologic recovery. Efficacious vaccines are available but twice yearly vaccination is recommended.

Dogs with noninfectious, nonerosive, idiopathic immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) commonly have spinal pain, and about 50% of these dogs have concurrent SRMA.188 Analysis of CSF usually reveals marked increases in protein and neutrophils. Bacterial cultures from the CSF are negative. IgA concentrations are increased in both the plasma and the CSF. Measurement of acute phase proteins in CSF may also aid in the diagnosis and management of affected dogs.194., 195. Most dogs respond dramatically to prednisone, 2 to 4 mg/kg every 24 hours.194 In dogs not responding to prednisone alone, additional immunosuppressive therapy may be needed. Once the signs are controlled, the dose of prednisone is decreased to alternate-day therapy, and then the total dose is gradually reduced over months. Relapses are common when the corticosteroid dose is too low or is discontinued.",

Briefly, minimum database (complete blood count, chemistry profile, and urinalysis) often discloses nonspecific abnormalities. Analysis of CSF is critical to establishing a presumptive antemortem diagnosis. Mononuclear pleocytosis, activated macrophages, occasionally neutrophils, and rarely mast cells with increases in protein content are common CSF abnormalities. Cross-sectional imaging also is important in the diagnostic workup. MRI of the brain is the imaging modality of choice. With MRI, multifocal hyperintensities on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences predominantly affecting the white matter are observed. Enhancement patterns vary on T1-weighted sequences after administration of contrast media. A focal space occupying mass or abnormalities involving the optic nerves may be observed in animals with the focal or ocular forms, respectively.203 Abnormal findings from CSF analysis and MRI of the brain can be found in other forms of MUE. Therefore, the value in pursuing these diagnostics tests is not only in documenting abnormalities but in excluding other disease processes; the greatest importance of which is eliminating infectious disease from consideration. Given the treatment of GME is centered on immunosuppression, misdiagnosis may be devastating in animals with infectious disease. Therefore, depending on the clinician\u2019s index of suspicion, further diagnostic testing aimed at the identification of an infectious etiology may be warranted. Likewise, CNS lymphoma may occur with clinical signs of multifocal signs and have MRI findings and lymphocytic pleocytosis that are difficult to differentiate from GME. PCR for the antigen receptor rearrangements may be useful in the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma.",

Some dogs respond to prednisone (2 to 4 mg/kg every 24 hours, using the aforementioned reducing-dosage regimen), but relapses and progression of neurologic signs are common in many dogs. Cytosine arabinoside, given as a single agent or in combination with prednisone, is a more effective treatment.204., 205. In one study of 10 dogs treated with cytosine arabinoside and prednisone, all dogs achieved partial or complete remission and the median survival time was 531 days; five dogs were still alive at the end of the study.206 Cytosine arabinoside is administered in cycles. Each cycle consists of administering the drug at a dose of 50 mg/m2 given subcutaneously twice a day for 2 consecutive days. Cycles are initially repeated every 3 weeks. With time, gradual lengthening of the interval between cycles can be done. In severely affected animals, initial administration of 600 mg/m2 given as a constant rate infusion over 2 days may be beneficial.207 To monitor for myelosuppression, a CBC should be performed 10 to 14 days following the first course of treatment and every 2 to 3 months throughout the course of therapy. Cyclosporine may also be effective in treating GME. Two protocols have been reported.205., 208. In one, cyclosporine was administered at 10 mg/kg every 24 hours for 6 weeks. The dose was then reduced to 5 mg/kg per day. Prednisone was also administered at 2 to 4 mg/kg daily for 3 to 4 weeks. In another protocol, cyclosporine was administered at 3 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours. Serum cyclosporine levels were followed but the drug was not detected in the CSF, even in dogs with good clinical response. In one study of 10 dogs treated with cyclosporine and prednisone, all dogs responded and the median survival time was 930 days.208 Procarbazine has also been used as an adjunctive therapy combined with prednisone.209 The dosage administered was 25 to 50 mg/m2 orally once daily. The combination of procarbazine and prednisone in 21 dogs provided a median survival time of 14 months. Seven dogs experienced myelosuppression and three dogs had hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.
