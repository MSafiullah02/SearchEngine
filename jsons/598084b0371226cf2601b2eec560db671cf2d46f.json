The outbreak component involving humans began in May and was confirmed by laboratory testing at the CDC by early June 2003. Monkeypox, known in animals since 1958 and in humans since 1970, is an orthopoxvirus related to variola and vaccinia viruses. Monkeypox had never previously been reported outside of Africa. There, secondary attack rates were low and did not extend beyond four generations, making it a disease of low epidemic potential. Two clades had been found, one West African and one Congolese. Unlike smallpox, monkeypox is a zoonosis. As in Africa, the US outbreak in 2003 was linked to infected animals. In general, clinical manifestations of monkeypox, including fever and the sequential appearance and resolution of the skin lesions, as well as the incubation period, are similar to smallpox. One specific finding that distinguishes monkeypox from smallpox is lymphadenopathy, especially in the cervical and inguinal regions, in patients with monkeypox [156] . Chickenpox (VZV) is another disease that should routinely be considered in the differential diagnosis of monkeypox. Indeed, in 2007 Rimoin and colleagues from the United States, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the WHO reported in a laboratory study of 136 patients from the DRC with suspected monkeypox, 51 (37.5%) were confirmed to have monkeypox, whereas 61 (45%) had Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) and one had infection with both viruses [157] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 88, "text": "[154,", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 89, "end": 93, "text": "155]", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1071, "text": "[156]", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1534, "text": "[157]", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Monkeypox: An Emerging Disease in the United States in 2003 and in Sudan in 2005"}, {"text": "The potential for monkeypox to be an emerging disease problem was discussed by Breman in 2000 and is related to the increasing contact of humans with animals in endemic areas and the waning of vaccinia-induced immunity [158] .
