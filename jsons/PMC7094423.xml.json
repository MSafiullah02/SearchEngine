Samples from SARS patients in our institute were sent to the CDC in Taiwan, where RT-PCR was performed using a protocol described in a report by Hsueh et al.15 As an adjunct for confirming the diagnosis, IgG antibody to the SARS-CoV detected by a standard indirect fluorescence antibody assay with titers > 1:25 in serum was used to test the samples. This laboratory work was developed later than RT-PCR by the CDC in Taiwan, and was applied to 12 of our 19 patients. Among them, 8 of 12 patients undergoing this test had positive results.",

All patients were scanned in the supine position, with additional scans obtained in the prone position to avoid physiologic-dependent areas of attenuation in the posterior lung.

The CT score in upper, middle, and lower lung zones was determined by visual estimation of the extent of disease in each zone. The score represented the percentage of lung parenchyma that showed evidence of abnormalities, mainly areas of GGO and fibrosis, estimated to the nearest 10% of parenchymal involvement. The overall percentage of involvement was obtained by averaging the six lung zones by each individual observer. Reproducibility or intraobserver variability of HRCT scoring was determined by correlating readings at the same images twice by two individual observers not aware of any clinical information. Final scores were determined by an average of scores assessed by two observers with a difference within 5%. Readings were repeated when the difference of scores between two observers exceeded 5% until a consensus was reached.",

Based on the above-described description, we classified patients into two groups: GGO and GGO with fibrosis (GGO+F). Six of seven patients (85.7%) who had areas of GGO without fibrosis did not show zonal predominance, and predominant involvement in the middle lung zones was observed in only one patient (14.3%). A random distribution without any central or peripheral predominance was evident in five patients (71.4%), whereas peripheral and peribronchovascular distribution was present in one patient (14.3%). In the GGO+F group, fibrosis predominantly involved all three lung zones in 10 patients (83.3%), with a random distribution in both central and peripheral regions in 11 of 12 patients (91.7%). A peripheral distribution was observed in only one patient, and one patient had middle and lower lung zone predominance. With regards to results of HRCT score, a high reproducibility of HRCT scoring was supported by a good correlation between readings for two times at the same films by observer 1 (r = 0.994, p < 0.001) and observer 2 (r = 0.996, p < 0.001), respectively. Results of HRCT scoring for each patient were shown in Table 1.

To date, investigation of functional changes that might correlate with structural changes depicted by CT, focusing on those who experience persistent respiratory symptoms during recovery from SARS, has not been reported.

            "text": "Similar to results reported by Antonio et al,12 patients in this study represented 37% of all discharged SARS patients (19 of 52 patients). Both of these studies have the same limitation as to investigate structural changes of the lung by HRCT only for symptomatic patients of SARS during recovery. It would be interesting to compare symptomatic patients with asymptomatic patients to see whether symptomatic patients have more severe HRCT abnormalities than those of asymptomatic patients. In our study, major findings on HRCT were bilateral patchy areas of GGO with or without fibrosis. These findings were in general agreement with those of Antonio and colleagues.12 Similar to their finding of fibrosis in 62% of patients, we identified fibrosis in more than half of our patients (12 of 19 patients, 63%). It is difficult to know how many of these structural changes will resolve by time. In patients with evidence of fibrosis at HRCT, the importance of concomitant presence of ground-glass opacification is not clear. Presumably, areas of ground-glass opacification may represent either residual inflammation that may resolve or may evolve to fibrosis over time. To address this speculation, a longer term of follow-up may be needed. It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis observed at the recovery phase would at least in part account for the respiratory symptoms. Compared with CT findings as a predominant lower lobe and peripheral distribution during the acute phase of SARS reported by Wong et al,11 we and Antonio et al12 observed generally no predominance in distribution of parenchymal abnormalities. This difference in patterns of CT abnormalities suggests either that structural changes related to SARS evolve over time, or that the underlying pathophysiologic process may resolve at varying rates.",

The identification of significantly higher-than-normal mean values for residual volume (RV) in the GGO group may indicate air trapping within the areas of GGO. In contrast, a more pronounced reduction of Dlco combined with a significant restrictive functional impairment in the GGO+F group was consistent with functional loss that characterizes parenchymal fibrosis. Interestingly, the significantly elevated RV but normal FEF50 observed in the GGO group may imply a component of small airway obstruction suggested by previous reports23,\n24,\n25 that demonstrated a number of patients with early airway disease or resolving reversible airway dysfunction despite normal mid-flow values.",

They concluded that the lung histology varied according to duration of illness. In their studies, cases with a time course > 10 days showed an organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. CT findings of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia are well characterized,27,\n28,\n29 and are similar to those of SARS.11 Taken together, results from previous pathologic and image studies, we speculate that a possible small airway dysfunction reflected by our pulmonary function study may be attributed to a possible presence of small airway obstruction within the area of GGO. In addition, GGO+F may reflect a repair process accompanying the parenchymal inflammation at varying phases of SARS, or may be a more extensive form of SARS-related lung injury reflected by a more pronounced functional impairment, as we have demonstrated.",

A recent report by Ho et al30 showed that PS therapy appeared to be a more efficacious and equally safe steroid regimen as compared with low-dose NPS in the acute stage of SARS. In contrast, we and Antonio et al12 employed a standard treatment protocol for SARS for adults recommended by So et al.20 All of our patients were treated with methylprednisolone in addition to the use of ribavirin and broad-spectrum antibiotics as diagnosis of SARS was confirmed. Unlike study reported by Ho et al,30 who divided their regimens of corticosteroid therapy into PS and NPS at the beginning of treatment for SARS, we administered PS only if the clinical condition worsened with deteriorating chest radiographic findings and decreasing oxygenation saturation. In our study, patients who had more pronounced HRCT abnormalities or worse PFTs results were virtually treated with PS because of a rapid deterioration of their clinical condition. It is therefore difficult to determine whether PS therapy was more efficacious than NPS based on our results. A prospective randomized trial and long-term follow-up of structural and functional changes of the lung is needed to determine whether PS is indeed superior to NPS in treating patients with SARS.",

ARDS reflects the most severe form of SARS, which leads to a mortality rate of 48%, similar to that of ARDS in patients with other types of pneumonia, and in patients with SARS who required critical care.31 Notably, the medical response to SARS-related ARDS extends well beyond intensive care for ARDS caused by other etiology, as it involves an overwhelming public health issue.32 Viral pneumonia usually resolves without any clinical or radiologic sequelae,33 whereas SARS-related respiratory sequelae appeared to be quite common among its survivors as observed by us and others.12,\n14 Intriguingly, follow-up CT scans of ARDS survivors other than SARS tend to be limited in extent, and usually show a predominance in ventral distribution of fibrosis and parenchymal opacification,34,\n35 whereas pulmonary abnormalities of SARS-related ARDS appear random in their distribution and are usually extensive. A restrictive type of functional impairment and decreased Dlco in ARDS survivors has been described by previous reports.36,\n37 However, Neff and colleagues38 reported recently that residual combined restrictive and obstructive type of functional impairment remained common in survivors of severe ARDS treated in surgical intensive unit. In general, lung volume and spirometric measurements returned to normal in most of the patients over time,37 but Dlco remained low in long-term follow-up.36,\n37,\n38 These results suggest that persistent decrease in Dlco reflects a permanent parenchymal damage of the lung as fibrosis in ARDS patients. Similarly, our evaluation on SARS-related functional changes in early recovery phase showed a restrictive defect and significantly decreased Dlco. It would be interesting to compare structural and functional changes in survivors of SARS-related ARDS during late recovery with those of ARDS survivors not related to SARS by a similar follow-up protocol.",
