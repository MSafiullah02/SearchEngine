CISA reviewed serious neurologic adverse events reported to VAERS after the pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine7 and found that when etiologic investigations were conducted, alternate (more likely) causes of the AEFI were often identified (eg, the occurrence of Campylobacter, Mycoplasma, or cytomegalovirus infections before Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome).14, 15 Although identification of an infectious agent at the time of the event cannot completely rule out any possibility that the vaccine was related to the event, this finding lessens the likelihood of a causal association with vaccine.",

CISA investigators review all data related to the AEFI, discuss the case with subspecialty experts and ideally the requesting provider, and answer specific questions, typically related to causality and future immunizations. Providers can contact the CISA network through the CISA website (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/CISA.html).

The reported risk interval for varicella rash after the varicella vaccine is 5-42 days,23 and the usual incubation period after wild-type varicella infection is typically 14-16 days.24 To establish the actual cause of the rash (ie, vaccine vs wild-type varicella) with the greatest level of certainty (step 3), a provider should: (1) obtain biological samples to confirm the presence of varicella; and (2) use molecular methods to determine whether it is wild-type or vaccine strain.25 A consultation with an infectious disease specialist would likely facilitate the logistics of this evaluation. Confirmation of cause (ie, wild-type or vaccine strain varicella virus) results in a clear causality assessment (step 5; Figure).",

The evaluation starts with establishing the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (step 1) with appropriate neurologic examinations and magnetic resonance imaging. The Brighton Collaboration has developed an ADEM case definition to help determine the level of diagnostic certainty.10 Step 2 requires the provider to consider carefully whether the symptoms began during an evidence-supported postvaccination risk interval. CISA has recently proposed a risk interval of 2-48 days for ADEM.30 Step 3 is the comprehensive laboratory evaluation for other possible causes for the event or evidence of vaccine association. Identification of suspected viral and bacterial organisms would require the collection of: (1) cerebrospinal fluid; (2) nasopharyngeal swab; (3) serum; and (4) stool samples (Table). ADEM may be managed with intravenous immunoglobulin; thus, it is important to obtain and save sera for later testing before intravenous immunoglobulin administration because this treatment will alter the patient's serologic status.31 An evaluation for systemic autoimmune disorders may also be appropriate. This thorough evaluation allows for the most informed causality assessment (step 5; Figure). CISA reviewed 8 cases of ADEM reported to VAERS after receipt of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine; of these, 2 patients were found to have concurrent parainfluenza virus infection.7\n",

The Institute of Medicine recently reviewed 158 specific AEFIs temporally associated with 1 of 8 vaccines38 according to a strict causal methodology that evaluated both mechanistic and epidemiologic evidence. \u201cMechanistic evidence\u201d was clinical or biological evidence that a vaccine could cause the specific event, and \u201cepidemiologic evidence\u201d was assessed according to the precision of results and methodologic limitations of peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies.38 The committee found that there was inadequate evidence to determine whether a causal link exists for the majority (135) of AEFIs, concluding that the current \u201cevidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship.\u201d Systematic reviews of AEFIs by CISA with comprehensive evaluations may provide additional data to assist in these causal determinations when reassessed in the future.43 With so much uncertainty regarding causal associations of serious AEFIs, health care providers can play an essential role in enhancing our vaccine safety knowledge by fully evaluating for all likely cauess at the time these events are diagnosed.",

One landmark discovery was reported by Berkovic et al, in 2006 in which investigators used genetic analyses to identify de novo mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN1A in patients with alleged vaccine-induced encephalopathy.47 By uncovering the mechanisms for this AEFI, which prior to this recent finding was believed by many to be causally related to vaccination, these researchers made a significant contribution to the scientific understanding of this rare event. The findings were recently replicated in 5 additional cases of alleged vaccine-induced encephalopathy.48 It is possible that some individuals experience a greater immunogenic response due to vaccine compared with the general population; understanding the genetic rationale for such events will likely be an important area of future research.49, 50\n",
