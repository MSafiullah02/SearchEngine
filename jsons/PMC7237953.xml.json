            "text": "Virus infection is initiated by the interaction between S protein and host cell surface receptors. The S protein would be cleaved by the cellular serine proteases TMPRSS2 into S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion [12,13]. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of S1 specifically binds to host cell receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or CD147, which causes the conformational change of S2. Then two heptad repeats join in S2 forming an anti-parallel six-helix bundle that allows for the mixing of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm subsequently [14,15]. After release, the viral genomic RNA begins to express. The replicase gene encodes two large ORFS, rep1a and rep1b, which express two co-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. They produce 16 unstructured proteins which assemble into the replicase\u2013transcriptase complex (RTC). RTC creates an environment suitable for RNA synthesis and is ultimately responsible for RNA replication and transcription of the sub genome RNAs. After replication and sub genome RNA synthesis, the S, E and M viral structural proteins are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), subsequently moved into endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [16]. There, N protein encapsulates viral genome buds into a membrane containing ERGIC to form mature viruses, which are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis [17].",

In addition, high levels of neutrophil extracellular traps may also contribute to cytokine release [21]. Ultimately, uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to shock and tissue damage in the heart, liver and kidney, as well as respiratory failure or multiple organ failure, causing death in patients with severe COVID-19 [22,23] (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Therapeutics with high specificity and efficacy is the ultimate goal of pathogenesis study, while target discovery is the foundation. Based on previous studies, spike protein, ACE2, TMPRSS2, 3CLpro, RdRp and PLpro are considered as major targets for antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronavirus infections [24]. Sharing high conservation of the catalytic site and homology with SARS-CoV [9,25], the above six proteins may be potential targets for the treatment of COVID-19. From the view of virus and cell fusion, Arbidol, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, as a virus-host cell fusion inhibitor, can prevent virus from entering host cells to treat COVID-19 [26]. It has also been shown that SARS-CoV-2 depends on Spike proteins on the surface to entry into host cells by binding to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cell surface [12]. ACE2 is the host cell surface receptor, which is the key to the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the host. Therefore, excess soluble forms of ACE2 or ACE2 inhibitors could be a possible methodology to treat COVID 19. In addition, Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can activate Spike protein and promote SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells, which plays an important role in the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells [12]. The existing TMPRSS2 inhibitor Carmustat mesylate, bromhexine hydrochloride may also be an effective treatment for COVID-19 [12,27]. From the view of virus proteases, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and Papain-like protease (PLpro) are two viral proteases responsible for cleaving viral peptides into functional units for virus replication and packaging in host cells. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, baicalin and baicalein exhibit strong antiviral activity in cell-based systems [28]; 6-Mercaptopurine (6 M P) and 6-thioguanine (6 TG) are specific inhibitors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain, deubiquitinated and isg-depleted cysteine proteases [29,30], they may be reasonable candidates. From view of virus replication, Nsp12, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is an important enzyme of the coronavirus replication/transcription complex [31]. Currently, inhibitors targeting RdRp are mainly ribavirin, remdesivir, etc., and these drugs mainly compete with physiological nucleotides for the RdRp active site [32].",

            "text": "Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) have a long-standing history as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in the prevention and treatment of malaria [34]. CQ/HCQ block viral from entering into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, proteolytic processing, and endosomal acidification, as well as regulate immunity through attenuation of cytokine production, inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal activity in host cells [35,36]. CQ can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection at a low-micro molar concentration and HCQ is more potent than CQ [37,38]. A multicenter clinical trial involving more than a dozen hospitals in China showed that CQ can improve radiologic findings, enhance viral clearance and reduce disease progression in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so China has included CQ in the recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [37,39,40]. At the same time, another clinical trial showed that HCQ can significantly shorten the clinical recovery time and promote the absorption of pneumonia among patients with COVID-19 [41]. Notably, azithromycin reinforced the effect of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 patients, but the publishing journal\u2019s society subsequently declared that the trial did \u201cnot meet the Society\u2019s expected Standard\u201d [42,43]. Conversely, the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir [44,45]. In summary, although CQ/HCQ have shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy both in vivo and in vitro trials as well as relatively well tolerated, some clinical trial designs and outcome data have not been submitted or published to peer review [46]. It is not recommended in the use of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 outside of the hospital or a clinical trial due to lack of reliable efficacy data and potential toxic effects [47,48].",

            "text": "Remdesivir (GS-5734), a prodrug of GS-441524 developed by the American pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, showed promise at the peak of the Ebola virus outbreak due to its low EC50 and host polymerase selectivity against the Ebola virus [49,50]. Subsequently, research about it also showed significant anti-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV activity [51,52]. As a nucleoside analog with exonuclease resistance, remdesivir is metabolized to active nucleoside triphosphates that effectively prevents the elongation of the RNA chain by inhibiting RNA polymerase, but will not be digested with a viral exonuclease (nsp14) with proofreading activity [53]. Compared with ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine and favipiravir (T-705), remdesivir has the best efficacy and the lowest toxic side effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells [32]. The United States first reported the clinical case of remdesivir in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia [54]. Currently, a number of clinical trials are ongoing, aiming to verify the safety and antiviral activity of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. Clinical findings of the team of Professor Cao Bin of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital suggested that the remdesivir is adequately tolerated but do not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in severe patients with COVID-19 [55]. However, the results of the global clinical trial are believed that remdesivir can relieve symptoms and reduce mortality, especially for patients in intensive care who require mechanical ventilation [56]. Meanwhile, the clinical trials in Chicago have suggested that early COVID-19 patients benefit more due to the reduction of lung damage [57]. In conclusion, remdesivir is still in the consideration of one of the most promising drugs for treatment COVID-19 currently [58].",

As a new protease inhibitor, LPV/r interrupts viral nucleic acid replication via inhibition of 3CLpro [63]. Xushun Guo\u2019s team at Sun Yat-sen University School of Medicine derived a homology modeling to confirm that LPV/r significantly inhibited the function of CEP_C30 to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction cycle [64]. In addition, two groups in China and Korea have reported LPV/r can improve the clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 [65,66]. Besides, LPV/r can achieve better antiviral effects when used with interferon or ninavir than alone [67]. However, the latest evidence suggests that it may cause liver damage and prolong hospital stay in the COVID-19 infected patients [68]. Furthermore, no benefit was observed with LPV/r treatment beyond standard care in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 [69]. Therefore, whether LPV/r can become an important adjuvant drug in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy and improve the clinical outcome of patients remains to be determined (Table 1\n).",

In addition, enzyme inhibition assays in vitro also showed that quercetin had inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro [112]. Since the 3CLpro sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV [10,25], we speculated that quercetin may also exhibit antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2. However, it has not been documented whether quercetin inhibits SARS-CoV-2, so we docked quercetin to 3CLpro as well as other key targets, and the docking results showed that quercetin bound well to each target, with a binding energy of -5.6 kcal/mol to 3CLpro. Surprisingly, we found that quercetin bounds better to Spike protein, ACE2, RdRp and PLpro indicating good potential against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, it has a wide range of sources with relatively low cost, so it is worth testing its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Previous studies have shown that andrographolide has a broad spectrum of antiviral properties, which inhibits various virus infections including influenza A virus (IAV) [115], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [116], Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [117], dengue virus (DENV) [118,119], and Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) [120]. Atchara Paemanee et al. suggested that andrographolide may exert broad-spectrum antiviral activity by interfering a variety of cellular pathways (including autophagy, unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and oxidative stress, etc.). They further found the anti-dengue virus activity by acting on GRP78, a key regulator of unfolded protein response [119]. In addition, andrographolide exerts antiviral activity against H1N1 by inhibiting the activation of RLRs signaling pathways and thereby improving H1N1 virus-induced cell death [121]. To test the anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2, we docked andrographolide with key targets, and the results also showed that andrographolide bound well to the key targets including Spike protein, ACE2, 3CLpro, RdRp and PLpro, which indicated that andrographolide has potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, Enmozhi, S. K. et al. proved andrographolide as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro through in silico studies [122]. Overall, as a plant-derived compound, andrographolide is widely distributed with low cytotoxicity, but its potent antiviral activity against a variety of viruses calls for further investigation.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizic acid is a plant product isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine licorice (Chinese name: Gan Cao). Glycyrrhiza uralensis contains active ingredients such as thymol and carvacrol, which have significant antiviral and bactericidal effects [123]. A large number of studies have shown that licorice and its chemical components have protective effect on lung inflammation and damage, and it is a promising herbal medicine for treating SARS [124]. Cinatl J et al. compared the effects of conventional antiviral drugs ribavirin, 6-azouridine, pyrazofurin, mycophenolic acid, and glycyrrhizic acid on SARS-CoV, and the experimental results showed that glycyrrhizic acid had a better viral inhibitory effect than the other four drugs in inhibiting the viral adsorption and penetration [125]. Hoever G et al. also showed that glycyrrhizic acid has a good anti-SARS-CoV effect, while SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to different subclasses of coronaviruses with similar structures [126]. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid can promote IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells [127]. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have the same receptor ACE2, and glycyrrhizic acid can bind to this receptor, suggesting that glycyrrhizic acid may have therapeutic effects on SARS-CoV-2 [128]. To discuss whether glycyrrhizic acid has an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, we performed molecular docking of glycyrrhizic acid with the binding energy of glycyrrhizic acid and ACE2 -7.0 kcal/mol (As the shown in Table 2). At the same time, the binding energy of glycyrrhizic acid with other targets: 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp and Spike is -6.9 kcal/mol, -7.3 kcal/mol, -7.2 kcal/mol, -6.5 kcal/mol, respectively. It can be seen that glycyrrhizic acid also has strong binding affinity to other targets. Given the antiviral effect of glycyrrhizic acid on SARS-CoV, and its potential interaction with ACE2, we speculated that glycyrrhizic acid may have potential to treat SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, glycyrrhizic acid plays an important role in inhibiting immune hyperactivation and cytokine storm factor development [129], therefore, we believe it is worth testing its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Baicalin, a component of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Chinese name: Huang Qin), has a wide range of therapeutic effects, including sensitization and anti-apoptosis [130,131]. Chen et al. have demonstrated the antiviral activity of baicalin against SARS coronavirus, with an EC50 value of 12.5 \u03bcg/ml at 48 hours, and the activity tended to decrease with incubation time beyond 48 hours [132]. Due to the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it can be speculated that baicalin may also have an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2. In addition, Deng et al. used UV spectrophotometry to determine angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity and found that baicalin could inhibit ACE in vitro, with an IC50 value of 2.24 mM [133]. Hansen Chen et al. used molecular docking technology to find that baicalin may have a strong binding effect with ACE2, and the possible binding sites are ASN-149, ARG-273, HIS-505 [128]. Haixia Su et al. showed that baicalin, as a non-covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, has high ligand binding efficiency and specific binding to proteases by ITC map, native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and its chemical structure [28]. At the same time, we used molecular docking to study the docking of baicalin to other key targets of SARS-CoV-2, in which the binding energy of baicalin to the target PLpro was -8.5 kcal/mol. The results of docking showed that baicalin bounds strongly to other targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). Therefore, it can be reasonably speculated that baicalin is one of the potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment. In view of the low toxic effect of baicalin, its effect against SARS-CoV-2 warrants further study.",

            "text": "Patchouli alcohol (PA), a tricyclic sesquiterpene compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine patchouli, has a wide range of pharmacological and biological effects including antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antitumor [134]. PA has been found to have anti-influenza A (IAV) effect in vitro, while H1N1 virus is the most sensitive to PA [135]. In addition, Yunjia Yu et al. found that intracellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV effect of PA and PA significantly inhibits the in vitro proliferation of different IAV, suggesting that PA may block IAV infection by directly killing viral particles and interfering with some early stages after viral adsorption [136]. Another study showed that PA also has an effect against influenza virus (IFV) in vivo and enhances protection against IFV infection in mice by enhancing host immune responses and attenuating systemic and pulmonary inflammatory responses [137]. To investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of PA, we investigated the possibility of PA binding to SARS-CoV-2 related targets using molecular docking (Table 2). The docking results showed that the binding effect of PA and Rdrp was satisfactory, which provided some support for the antiviral effect of PA. The above study results showed that patchouli alcohol had antiviral effect and also modulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that PA may be a novel and effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug for COVID-19.",

            "text": "Luteolin, a natural flavonoid extracted from Chinese herbal medicine, displays multiple biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antioxidant, antiviral, and heart protective [138]. It was reported that luteolin can interfere with the virus in early virus life cycle, to a certain extent, block the absorption and internalization of influenza virus, thereby inhibited the replication of IAV [139]. The above experiments suggested that luteolin is a potential antiviral drug that inhibits viral replication by regulating host proteins. In addition, Minhua Peng et al. confirmed luteolin inhibited the dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease activity by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the luteolin-resistant escape mutant [140]. It also has been documented luteolin has an anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) effect, and in immunoblot analysis, 20 \u03bcg/mL of luteolin showed a significant inhibitory effect on EBV lytic cycle [141]. Another study showed that luteolin extracted from Torreya Nucifera is an effective SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor [112]. To interrogate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of luteolin, we performed molecular docking of luteolin to key targets of SARS-CoV-2. The docking results showed that luteolin bound well to the key target of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, the binding energy of luteolin to ACE2 was -7.1 kcal/mol (Table 2). Taken together, luteolin has a good antiviral effect, which suggests that luteolin may be a potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Our aim of docking was to select natural compounds with high potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, but it should be pointed out that these compounds cannot be considered to treat COVID-19 only by such a screen which is aimed to provide priority to focus. Furthermore, the 3D structure of the targets we used were based on the reported gene sequences. If the virus mutates during transmission, new screening is recommended. In conclusion, our review summarizes more than a dozen of natural compounds classified as antiviral/pneumonic protectors, which may directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2.

At present, Qingfei Paidu Decoction is recommended for the treatment of clinically confirmed cases according to Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Pneumonia (On Trials, the Seventh Edition) in China [39]. A study including 98 patients with COVID-19 showed that Qingfei Paidu Decoction has a good clinical effect for the treatment of COVID-19, it can significantly improve the abnormal laboratory test indicators and clinical symptoms of patients, reduce the adverse reactions of patients, and effectively improve the therapeutic effect [154]. In addition, Lianhua Qingwen was also demonstrated to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells at the mRNA level as well as markedly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that Lianhua Qingwen may have a potential inhibitory effect on the cytokine storm induced by SARS-COV-2 [155]. At present, symptomatic and supportive therapy is still the key to clinical treatment.
