The viral papain\u2010like protease (PLP) domain is contained in nsp3 of coronaviruses and participates in the proteolytic processing of the N\u2010terminal region of the polyproteins. It could cleave nsp1|nsp2, nsp2|nsp3, and nsp3|nsp4 sites, while all sites downstream nsp4 are processed by nsp5.6, 7 Besides cleaving the polyproteins, PLPs also possess a related enzymatic activity to promote virus replication: deubiquitinating (DUB) and de\u2010ISGylating activities, although their physiological functions have not been completely clarified.8, 9 Both ubiquitin and ISG15 are involved in preventing viral infection, and several viruses have utilized Ubl\u2010conjugating pathways to counter the pro\u2010inflammatory properties of Ubl\u2010conjugated host proteins.10, 11 For coronaviruses, one such mechanism relies on evading the host immune response via the action of viral isopeptidase.12, 13\n",

The catalytic cysteine (Cys101) is situated at the foot (N\u2010terminus) of \u03b1\u2010helix3 in the thumb domain, as the helix dipole could contribute to the microenvironment that stabilizes the thiolate of Cys during catalysis and this structural feature may also contribute to the nucleophilicity of Cys101.14, 29 The side chain sulfur atom of Cys101 is positioned 3.21 \u00c5 from the side\u2010chain nitrogen atom of the catalytic\u2010triad histidine (His256), which is located at the foot of the palm domain, and adjacent to the flexible loop BL2.

Despite this, SADS\u2010CoV PLP2 can cleavage both substrates, conceivably with different efficiencies.

And this would explain why SADS\u2010CoV PLP2 has a higher catalytic efficiency of KAGG\u2010AMC over LRGG\u2010AMC. Furthermore, the model of PLP2 in complex with ubiquitin supported by the mutagenesis studies provides insights into the molecular interactions between the enzyme and substrate. The extensive interactions predicted between PLP2 and Ub beyond the extreme C\u2010terminal sequence (LRLRGG) may account for the significantly higher activity of PLP2 with Ub\u2010AMC than with the Z\u2010LRGG or Z\u2010KAGG tetrapeptide.
