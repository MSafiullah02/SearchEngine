            "text": "Multisubunit protein complexes play critical roles in numerous cellular processes, such as gene regulation, protein degradation, and intracellular signaling. Some complexes are abundant in cells and can be obtained from natural sources for use in biochemical and biophysical experiments. However, expressions of many others are spatiotemporally restricted, particularly in eukaryotes; therefore, overproduction of the recombinant complexes is often required for biochemical and biophysical analyses. Multisubunit protein complexes can be prepared in two different ways: recombinant subunits are either produced separately in cells and reconstituted in vitro, or coexpressed and reconstituted in cells. The first approach is effective when individual subunits themselves are stable and soluble in cells. Otherwise, the latter, the coexpression approach, is the only method of obtaining sufficient amounts of protein complexes for analyses. Unfortunately, most protein complexes in eukaryotes have subunits that are unstable and/or insoluble in isolation.",

Several coexpression systems using E. coli have been developed. Insertion of several genes of interests with their upstream ribosome binding sites (i.e., the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) between one promoter in the 5\u2032-end and one terminator in the 3\u2032-end enables polycistronic expression of proteins. Furthermore, cotransformation with two or three expression plasmids carrying different antibiotic resistance markers can be used for the coexpression. However, many eukaryotic protein complexes have subunits that are difficult to produce in E. coli, possibly owing to problems on transcription, translation, folding, and/or posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation and glycosylation), resulting in the failure of efficient production in E. coli.",

Polyhedrin and p10 are products from the AcNPV genome and highly accumulated in the late stage of infection [1]. Their transcription promoters allow overproduction of proteins in insect cells. Genes of interest are first inserted between one of these strong transcription promoters (polyhedrin or p10 promoter) and a polyadenylation signal (SV40 or HSVtk polyadenylation signal) in the transfer vector and then integrated into the engineered AcNPV genome. The engineered AcNPV genome containing genes of interest is transfected to cells of the caterpillar Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 or Sf21 cell line. The transfected Sf cells produce viruses that can infect insect cells to overexpress genes of interest. Suspension culture of the transfected Sf cells in shaker flasks is convenient and effective for large-scale protein production.\n",

In the first case, both the linearized AcNPV genome containing a lethal deletion and the transfer vector are cotransfected into insect cells, and recombination occurs between the engineered AcNPV genome and the transfer vector. Because the transfer vector can rescue the lethal deletion of the engineered AcNPV genome, viruses that are generated from the genome fused with the transfer vector propagate. However, practically, this strategy might generate nonrecombinant viruses, which could apparently decrease virus titer (infection efficiency) and gene expression level. In such a case, a virus species with higher titer should be isolated from a single plaque by a plaque assay, which may require additional time and effort. This step can be bypassed when genes of interest are integrated to the engineered AcNPV genome in E. coli cells, applying the transposing reaction of the Tn7 transposon [2].",

Tn7 transposon encodes a Tn7 transposase complex, which catalyzes the insertion of DNA elements containing the specific sequences Tn7L and Tn7R into the attTn7 site of another DNA molecule. As the transfer vector containing Tn7L and Tn7R is introduced to specific E. coli strains with a copy of the engineered AcNPV genome containing attTn7 and a helper plasmid encoding the Tn7 transposase complex, the transfer vector is transposed to the attTn7 site of the engineered AcNPV genome in the E. coli cells. Because the attTn7 site in the engineered AcNPV genome is located in the middle of lacZ\u03b1, positive clones (i.e., E. coli cells containing the transposed AcNPV genome) are easily selected by standard blue-white selection in the presence of X-Gal and IPTG. The integrated AcNPV genome can then be isolated from the positive clones by a standard alkaline lysis protocol and used for the subsequent transfection to S. frugiperda cells.",

However, this strategy can only be used under specific conditions because it is difficult to achieve a uniform expression of individual subunits owing to the differences in virus titer and gene expression level. Differences in the expression level among individual subunits may result in the failure of homogeneous complex formation. Another versatile option is multigene incorporation to a single AcNPV genome to generate a single species of virus that can produce multisubunit proteins. The MultiBac expression system was designed and developed for this purpose by Berger and colleagues [3\u20135].",

In addition, between these two multicloning sites, there is the multiplication module M to be digested by the restriction enzymes BstZ17I and SpeI, which generate cohesive ends compatible with those generated from PmeI and AvrII, respectively. Therefore, a multigene expression cassette withdrawn from one transfer vector by PmeI-AvrII digestion can easily be incorporated into the BstZ17I-SpeI-digested multiplication module M in another transfer vector (Fig. 3a). Iteration of the incorporation using the multiplication module can multiply expression cassettes in the transfer vector. Similarly, in the \u201cthird-generation (new)\u201d MultiBac system [4] (http://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20120313121202_p54.pdf), transfer vectors (i.e., pACEBac1, pACEBac2, pIDC, pIDK, and pIDS) (Fig. 2b) have one multicloning site flanked by a homing endonuclease site (I-CeuI for pACEBac1 and pACEBac2 or PI-SceI for pIDC, pIDK, and pIDS) and a compatible BstXI site, which enable iterative incorporation of expression cassettes to the transfer vector, generating a multigene transfer vector (Fig. 3b).",

Both acceptors and donors have a short imperfect inverted repeat (LoxP) for the recombination reaction catalyzed by Cre recombinase [6]. Only acceptors contain Tn7L and Tn7R for integration to the engineered AcNPV genome. Acceptors have a ColE1 DNA replication origin and can propagate in standard E. coli cloning strains, whereas donors have an R6K\u03b3 DNA replication origin and require a pir gene product for their propagation. Therefore, donors can be retained in pir-negative E. coli strains only when they are fused with acceptors. Propagation of donors in pir-negative E. coli strains indicates that the donors are appropriately fused with acceptors. This is an important feature because E. coli cells can retain two or more independent (i.e., unfused) plasmids with distinct antibiotic markers simultaneously in the presence of the antibiotics. One acceptor can be fused with one or two donors by in vitro Cre recombinase reaction in one step, followed by transformation of standard pir-negative E. coli strains with the resultant multigene transfer vector in the presence of the appropriate combination of antibiotics. In the new MultiBac system, the Cre-mediated fusion with three donors can be practically performed in two steps.",

TFIID is composed of the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) with a total molecular weight of over 1 MDa. The TFIID core complex (five subunits, Mw 650 kDa) was produced using the MultiBac system and subjected to cryo-EM analysis, revealing its subunit stoichiometry and architecture [7]. For the production of this TFIID core complex, an additional technology was applied for the uniform expression of the individual subunits. Coexpression of the TFIID core subunits by the original MultiBac system showed imbalanced production of the individual subunits, which hampered the purification of the complexes. This imbalanced expression problem was solved by a polyprotein strategy, where a number of proteins are encoded in one large open reading frame (ORF) and generated by proteolysis with a highly specific protease in a manner similar to protein production by RNA viruses such as the coronavirus. The TAF-encoding genes are concatenated into a single ORF, spaced by cleavage sites for a protease NIa from the tobacco etch virus (TEV). The TEV protease gene precedes the TAF genes in the ORF. A cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) gene is also inserted in the 3\u2032 end of the ORF for checking the expression of all conjoined proteins.",

Higher-resolution analysis of complex structures requires more homogeneous samples in terms of size, composition, and posttranslational modification and conformation, which typically require the removal of specific subunits and/or modification of the individual subunits by site-directed mutations and/or trimming regions that are predicted or experimentally shown to be flexible or disordered. The modular concept of the MultiBac system is highly compatible with this optimization process. It has been announced that the MultiBac system is still under development and that new technologies are planned to be included. This powerful tool for the production of multiprotein complexes will further accelerate the study of the structural biology of challenging targets to elucidate more complex biological processes.",

PirLC strains are used when inserted genes make the propagation of donor plasmids difficult in PirHC.We favor restriction enzyme digestion for the linearization of vectors for SLIC in order to avoid PCR-associated mutations.The uncut original circular vector sometimes migrates similarly to the cassette and cannot be removed by gel extraction. To avoid this problem, we recommend using vectors with two different antibiotic resistance makers for the cassette-mediated multiplication (e.g., the cassette from pUCDM is transferred to pFL).Although we never tried fusion with more than two donors, an online manual for the new system describes in detail the protocol for fusion with more than two donors. Following such a protocol, the Cre reaction is performed at 30 \u00b0C for 1\u20132 h with ~500 ng of each donor and ~400 ng of one acceptor (http://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20120313 121202_p54.pdf).According to the online manual (http://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20120313121202_p54.pdf), restriction analysis using appropriate restriction enzymes is highly recommended for confirming the presence of all genes in the vector.We try both DH10Bac and DH10MultiBac and compare them.Protocols for chemically competent cells are described in the online manual for the new system (http://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20120313121202_p54.pdf).Solutions 1, 2, and 3 are our own preparations, but solutions from commercially available plasmid mini-prep kits can be used for the bacmid isolation.We quickly move to Step 3.5 after isolating the integrated AcNPV genome.A 35 mm culture dish is available for this purpose. However, we recommend a 6-well plate because media in the culture dish seem to evaporate much faster than those in the 6-well plate.We quickly move to Step 3.6 after preparing P1 virus.We reuse plastic Erlenmeyer flasks supplied by Corning after autoclaving.Baculoviruses can be stored in liquid N2 in the form of baculovirus-infected insect cells (BIICs), which is widely adopted in many laboratories [11] (http://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20120313121202_p54.pdf). This BIIC storage is recommended in terms of space saving in refrigerators and almost no loss of titer. Some viruses lose their transfection activity within a month or less when stored in the form of a virus solution at 4 \u00b0C, while others retain the activity for more than a 2\u20133 years.Protein expression level may depend on incubation time. You can determine when cells stop proliferation after infection and analyze time-dependent changes in expression level by sampling one million cells every 12 or 24 h after the proliferation arrest.For protein production, High Five cells (derived from the caterpillar Trichoplusia ni) may be more suitable than Sf cells in some cases.Optionally, 1 day after infection, the infected cells are cultured at 20 \u00b0C for 72 h. This change in culture temperature increases the expression level and/or protein solubility in some cases.\n",
