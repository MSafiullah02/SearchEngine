These findings indicate that travelers planning to visit MERS-CoV affected countries should be vaccinated against influenza virus. Here, we describe the results from a 2016 and 2017 surveillance study in the most populous province in Korea, the Gyeonggi province (population: 25.5 million; area: 11,730 km2), and we demonstrate the Korean public health effort to prevent local transmission of MERS-CoV. In 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced a large outbreak of MERS-CoV with 186 laboratory-confirmed cases [2]. In this outbreak, inter-hospital and intra-hospital transmission were determination factors of the MERS-CoV infections [2]. After the outbreak, a Korean national surveillance program with virological testing for MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses was implemented to rapidly identify infected travelers returning from MERS-CoV-affected countries.",

Additional rRT-PCR using respiratory swabs was conducted to identify other respiratory viruses including influenza (IFV; A, B), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV; A, B), human metapneumovirus (hMPV; A, B), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV; I, II, III), human adenovirus (hAdV), human bocavirus (hBoC), human rhinovirus (hRV), and human coronavirus (hCoV; 229E, OC43, NL63). Table 1\nshows the characteristics of the suspected cases. There were 56 male cases among 99 suspected cases. Seven of the suspected cases had underlying disease (either hypertension or diabetes, or both). The median age of the suspected case group was 43 years (range, 1 to 70; mean, 42.3); and the group had a median of 11 contacts (range, 1 to 33; mean, 21.2). The median delay between the onset of symptoms and the notification of the public health authority was 30 hours (range, 0\u2013240 hrs; mean, 21 hrs). In addition, the median time interval was 1.0 hour (range, 0\u201363 hrs; mean, 3.4 hrs) between notification and patient quarantine of case, and it was 35 hours (range, 2\u2013240 hrs; mean, 53 hrs) between the onset of symptoms and patient quarantine.",

All the specimens obtained during the study were confirmed as MERS-CoV negative.
