Nevertheless, more than 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV worldwide [1]. Despite the high incidence of infection, a cellular receptor for HBV entry is still unknown. Several putative binding factors have been described for the HBV surface antigens (HBsAg), such as human serum albumin [2], asialoglycoprotein receptor [3], heparin [4] and mannose binding lectin [5], but their exact role in HBV attachment and uptake remains unclear [6].",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, consisting of a core particle enveloped by small (S), middle (M) and large (L) surface antigens, generally referred to as HBsAg. All three surface antigens contain a common S domain, both M and L proteins contain a preS2 domain and L exclusively contains a preS1 domain [7]. The liver and peripheral blood of HBV infected individuals can reach levels of 109\u20131010 infectious particles per mL. In addition, HBsAg is secreted from infected hepatocytes as spherical subviral particles and filaments, which can accumulate up to 100 \u03bcg/mL in peripheral blood [7, 8]. S is the main component of both HBV virions and HBsAg subviral particles, while M and L are highly enriched on HBV virions. Post\u2010translational modifications of the surface antigens are crucial for HBV life cycle; myristoylation of the preS1 domain is essential for infectivity [6, 9], while inhibition of N\u2010glycosylation of the preS2 domain prevents secretion of viral particles [10, 11]. Recently, post\u2010translational N\u2010glycosylation of the preS1 domain has been reported as well and although it seems dispensable for HBV morphogenesis it might be involved in viral attachment [12].",

C\u2010type lectins recognize highly conserved pathogen\u2010derived carbohydrate structures, leading to internalization, antigen processing and presentation to T cells [14]. A prototypical member of the C\u2010type lectin family is the dendritic cell\u2010specific lectin DC\u2010SIGN [15], which recognizes a broad range of glycosylated pathogens through mannose or fucose containing carbohydrates, including HIV\u20101, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, Dengue virus, measles virus, human herpesvirus 8, SARS coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tubercolosis, Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus pneumonia and Neisseria meningitidis [16, 17, 18]. The outcome of this interaction is pathogen\u2010dependent. Many of these DC\u2010SIGN\u2010binding pathogens have evolved to subvert the immune surveillance function of DC\u2010SIGN for their own benefit and re\u2010direct the internalization route to nonlysosomal compartments for protection and transmission to target cells [16]. Some pathogens can also modulate adaptive immune responses through interaction with DC\u2010SIGN; e.g. M. tuberculosis exploits DC\u2010SIGN to escape immune surveillance by inhibition of the immunostimulatory function of dendritic cells [16, 19].",

For HCV virus\u2010like particles, DC\u2010SIGN interaction leads to efficient capture, internalization and transport to nonlysosomal compartments within immature dendritic cells, thereby protecting the virus from degradation [21, 22]. Similarly, HCV virus\u2010like particles interact with L\u2010SIGN expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in situ, and are targeted to nonlysosomal early endosomes in L\u2010SIGN transfected Raji cells [22]. DC\u2010SIGN and L\u2010SIGN are also thought to play an important role in HCV viral dissemination by transferring HCV from the circulation to hepatocytes, the main HCV target cells [23].",

These data suggest that the N\u2010linked glycosylation of HBV is distinct from that of other viruses. To evaluate whether indeed native HBV glycosylation does not meet the requirements for DC\u2010SIGN interaction, glycan modified HBV was generated by treating HBV\u2010producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the \u03b1\u2010mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine. Kifunensine causes the accumulation of Man7\u20139GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides on glycoproteins by inhibiting mannose trimming in the endoplasmic reticulum [36]. Carbohydrate analysis of glycan modified HBV indeed demonstrated an increased amount of mannose structures compared to native HBV, shown by a two\u2010fold increase in binding to the mannose\u2010specific plant lectins Con A and GNA while binding to the N\u2010acetylglucosamine\u2010specific lectin WGA was unchanged (Fig. 5b). Control incubations with an anti\u2010HBsAg specific antibody showed that similar amounts of native and highly glycosylated HBV were coated (Fig. 5a). The interaction between highly mannosylated HBV and DC\u2010SIGN was studied by DC\u2010SIGN\u2010Fc\u2010based ELISA (Fig. 5c). Strikingly, HBV binding to DC\u2010SIGN was observed after kifunensine treatment of the virus producing cells, and the binding could be inhibited by both mannan and EGTA. The protein structure of HBV is therefore compatible with DC\u2010SIGN binding, but the native glycosylation, that exclusively determines DC\u2010SIGN interaction, is not. This observation also excludes the possibility that lack of DC\u2010SIGN\u2010HBV interaction is observed due to too low sensitivity of the DC\u2010SIGN assays used in this study. Supernatant of untreated HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cells showed no binding to DC\u2010SIGN. Minor background binding was observed with supernatant of kifunensine\u2010treated HepG2 cells, due to the accumulation of large amounts of highly mannosylated proteins in the medium during treatment. These data indicate that mannose trimming of the oligosaccharide structures present on HBV prevents interaction with DC\u2010SIGN.",

Related to the issue of HBV entry is the way HBV reaches the hepatocyte: Is there direct contact between HBV in the circulation and hepatocytes, possibly through fenestrations in the LSEC [37]?

Although HBV glycoproteins are involved in viral recognition, as they are known to bind mannose binding lectin and the asialoglycoprotein receptor, here it is shown that \u03b1\u2010mannosidase I trimming of N\u2010linked oligosaccharide structures prevents recognition by DC\u2010SIGN.
