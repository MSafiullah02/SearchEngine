[27] Synthetic chemical-fuel driven self-assembly processes have been reported that also rely on noncovalent interactions between the building blocks and ac hemical fuel. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] However,while most cases allude to similarities with microtubule formation or related biological dissipative processes,i tt urns out that in all the cases reported so far, af undamentally different mechanism is operative ( Figure 1b ). [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Contrary to what happens in Nature,energy dissipation, intended as the release of energy stored in the chemical fuel, is not catalysed by the building blocks,but rather by external elements such as an enzyme.T his difference is of crucial importance,a sto chemically drive an assembly process away from equilibrium using achemical fuel, two fundamental prerequisites are that (1) the fuel-to-waste conversion is catalysed by the building blocks and that (2) fuel conversion is more efficient in the assembled state.T hese insights have emerged from ar ecent theoretical analysis of chemical-fuel driven self-assembly processes. [12] Numerous research groups are currently pursuing synthetic dissipative self-assembly processes that mimic by design the mechanism of microtubules. [16, 21, 23, 30, 33] The system that comes closest to meeting the above-cited criteria is reported by Otto et al. whom described the substrateinduced structural reconfiguration of ad ynamic covalent library in favour of the library component best adapted to catalyse the conversion of the substrate. [15] Herein we show,to the best of our knowledge,t he first example of substrateinduced templation of an oncovalent assembly,w hich simultaneously acts as ac atalyst for its cleavage by exhibiting cooperativity.T his represents the first steps in the operating scheme of the driven self-assembly of microtubules (Figure 1c) .",

            "text": "We recently demonstrated that the assembly behaviour of amphiphiles can be regulated by the addition of small oligoanions. [30, 31] Amphiphilic C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (Figure 1b) , containing Zn 2+ -complexed 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (TACN) head groups were observed to form stabilised vesicular assemblies in the presence of ATP. These studies relied on the ability of charged counterions to effectively stabilize the assembly of surfactants containing charged head groups. [39] [40] [41] Such counterions have been shown to significantly decrease the critical assembly concentration (cac) of amphiphiles in Angewandte Chemie Zuschriften solution. [30, 31, 39] Importantly,the TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ moiety featured in the above studies has also been utilised as catalysts for the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. [42] [43] [44] This transphosphorylation reaction is known to require at least two metal ions acting cooperatively to achieve productive levels of activity. Manea et al. demonstrated that the complexation of Zn 2+ by TACN units immobilised on the surface of gold nanoparticles allows cooperativity to occur between proximal catalytic moieties,leading to remarkable efficiencies in the cleavage of phosphate esters. [42] These nanoparticles covered with an organic monolayer of TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ groups have been termed \"nanozymes\", as they possess many key features of natural enzymes,i ncluding Michaelis-Menten kinetics and cooperativity. [42, 45] Our goal was to investigate whether these two effects-templation and catalysis-could be combined in as ingle system in which the phosphodiester substrate would induce assembly of TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ -containing amphiphiles,a nd in this way,a lso generate the catalyst for its destruction (Figure 1c ). Themodel substrate typically used in the study of RNAp hosphodiester hydrolysis is 2-hydroxypropyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate (HPNPP). [42, 43] HPNPP is negatively charged and contains ap hosphate group which we have shown previously to exhibit high affinities for the TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ moiety. [46] We thus had reason to believe that HPNPP would be able to act as an efficient counterion and to have as ignificant effect on the assembly behaviour of C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ .T he cac of C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ in the absence of substrate was first measured by titrating increasing amounts of the surfactant to an aqueous solution buffered at pH 7.0 containing the fluorescent apolar probe Nile red (5 mm, l ex = 570 nm, l em = 643 nm). This probe is solubilised by the apolar compartment of the assemblies,l eading to an increase in fluorescence intensity after the cac has been reached (Figure 2a) . Thec ac was determined to be approximately 93 mm under these conditions,w hich is in close agreement with previous studies. [30] Thec ac was next determined in the presence of different concentrations of HPNPP substrate. Figure 2b shows the significant decrease in the cac of C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ with increasing concentrations of HPNPP. Theinitial drop in cac is steep,with substrate binding shifting the cac down to 34 mm in the presence of 125 mm of HPNPP. Further increases in the concentration of HPNPP resulted in additional decreases in the cac, eventually levelling off at around 13 mm in the presence of 1mm of HPNPP.T he decrease in cac demonstrates that the presence of HPNPP increases the thermodynamic stability of the formed assemblies.T he induced formation of assemblies below the native cac was further supported by dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments,inwhich assemblies of 24 AE 15 nm were detected (Figure 2c ). Objects of comparable size were also observed by (cryo) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/cryoTEM) and scanning laser confocal microscopy images (Figure 2d) , supporting the fact that HPNPP promotes the formation of vesicular assemblies.",

At low concentrations of C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (0-50 mm), very low reaction rates are observed. At ac oncentration of around 50 mm, however, the measured initial rates started to increase significantly,w ith the reaction rate being directly proportional to the surfactant concentration. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this experiment. Theo bservation that the change of slope is observed at aconcentration (54 mm), which closely matches the cac under these conditions ( % 55 mm,s ee SI, section 4b), indicates that assembly formation facilitates catalysis.Inaddition, comparison of the slopes below and above the cac shows that the assemblies have as ignificantly higher activity compared to the monomeric surfactant. Thesignificant rate enhancement upon assemblyformation is confirmed by additional studies that are described below.I ndependent evidence for catalysis was obtained from 31 P-NMR spectroscopy.Afixed amount of C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (75 mm)was added to aconstant concentration of HPNPP (1.0 mm)a nd changes in the 31 PNMR spectra were monitored as afunction of time (see SI, section 4c).

Experiments were performed at 50 mm of surfactant and 500 mm of HPNPP,a t conditions where the system is in the assembled state both in the presence and absence of Zn 2+ ions (see SI, section 4d). Thesigmoidal curve observed for the initial rate as afunction of Zn 2+ concentration is characteristic of cooperative catalysis by metal centres. [42, 43] At low concentrations of Zn 2+ metal ions (up to around 30 mol %s aturation of the head groups) low reaction rates are observed, because of the low number of catalytic pockets formed by neighbouring Zn 2+ complexes.At higher Zn 2+ -loadings,the amount of catalytic pockets rapidly increases and, consequently,t he rate increases significantly until amaximum is reached when the system is fully saturated with Zn 2+ ions.",

Indeed, it had been previously reported that an analogous surfactant with as horter chain showed very low catalytic activity for the same reaction, which was attributed to the highly dynamic nature of the assemblies. [42] To investigate this aspect in more detail, we decided to prepare and study aseries of surfactant molecules with hydrophobic chains of varying lengths,from ethyl (C 2 TACN)t hrough to stearyl (C 18 TACN) as the kinetic stability of surfactant-based assemblies is known to increase with the lengthening of the alkyl chain. [47, 48] Figure 4a shows the transphosphorylation activity at different concentrations of surfactants and equimolar Zn 2+ in ab uffered solution containing excess HPNPP (500 mm). Analysis of the data shows,asexpected, ageneral increase in reaction rate with increasing concentrations of C n TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ .However,differences in reactivity of multiple orders of magnitude are observed between catalysts with hydrophobic chains of different lengths measured at the same head group concentration. Fore xample,t he rate of reaction with C 18 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ is roughly double the rate of reaction with C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ at 100 mm,w hich is over am agnitude higher than that of C 14 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (note the logarithmic scale on both axes). At the same concentration, the activities of C 12 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ or C 2 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ were negligible.I mportantly,c omparison of the onset of catalytic activity with the cac value (42 mm)ofC 14 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ in the presence of 500 mm HPNPP confirms that assembly is ap rerequisite for observing catalysis (see SI, section 4e for details). Indeed, the poor catalytic activity of C 12 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ and C 2 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ is in agreement with the fact that these surfactants do not assemble at the concentration regime studied.",

Yet, the observed large difference between for example C 14 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ and C 18 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ indicates clearly that this is not the case.T og ain further insight into this difference,t he catalytic activity of C 18 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ and C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ was measured at varying concentrations of HPNPP (Figure 4b) . Fitting of the satu- ration profiles to the Michaelis-Menten equation yielded similar V max values for C 18 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (7.8 AE 0.3 10 \u00c08 mol s \u00c01 )a nd C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (7.2 AE 0.6 10 \u00c08 mol s \u00c01 ), but as ignificantly lower K M value for C 18 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (0.53 AE 0.06 mm)c ompared to C 16 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ (1.0 AE 0.1 mm). Then early identical V max values indicate that no intrinsic difference exists between the catalytic pockets in the formed assemblies,w hereas the different K M values indicate that the difference originates from the binding interaction between the surfactants and HPNPP.I ti si mportant to emphasize that, in contrast to aregular covalent catalyst such as an enzyme or nanozyme,i nt his system the substrate also affects the amount of catalyst present by acting on the equilibrium between monomeric and assembled states.T he observation that the cac values in the presence of the same amount of HPNPP are inversely correlated to the hydrophobicity of the surfactant, implies that ah igher amount of catalyst is present at the same concentration of HPNPP.T his explains the higher observed rate at lower substrate concentrations and, consequently,t he difference in apparent K M . Taken together,t he three-order of magnitude increase in activity upon self-assembly (comparing C 18 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ and C 2 TACN\u00b7Zn 2+ )s uggests that the enhanced activity with increasing the chain length could arise from the thermodynamic interplay between the surfactant and the substrate.",

The observation that the waste products of HPNPP cleavage are able to stabilise the formation of assemblies was supported by measuring the cac of the system in the presence of cP and PNP (see Figure 2b) . These experiments suggest that cP and PNP have similar affinity for the assemblies as the substrate HPNPP.Regrettably,itimplies that in the current system we are not able to observe the spontaneous dissociation of assembled structures after fuel consumption. Yet, this state is still ar esponsive one as shown by refuelling experiments in which successive batches of chemical fuel are added at 48 h intervals (Figure 3d ). Thec atalytic activity can be reactivated, but with successively lower rates due to the build-up of waste products which compete with the HPNPP substrate for binding to the surface of the assembled structures.This shows that binding is reversible and that the catalyst does not become irreversibly inhibited by the accumulated waste.",
