            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) are common diseases among children. Viral pathogens play an important role in infants who present with ALRI (Jennings et al., 2004, Iwane et al., 2004). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral pathogen in infancy. In addition, children with RSV infections are also exposed to a variety of other viruses with a similar seasonal pattern, mainly during the winter months, such as influenza, parainfluenza, rhinoviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Despite the fact that numerous studies have revealed that some ALRI pediatric patients become simultaneously infected with multiple respiratory viruses, most studies fail to discuss the issue in depth. Whereas some of these papers show a worse ALRI prognosis with multiple viral infections (Tristram et al., 1988, Semple et al., 2005), others reveal a very similar prognosis relative to ALRI with a single virus (Kellogg, 1991, Huang et al., 1998, Subbarao et al., 1989).",

Specimens were processed within 24 h of collection. Upon receipt of NPA, samples were aliquoted in duplicates at 200 \u03bcl and one of them immediately processed. The second aliquot and the remaining specimen were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nucleic acids were extracted from the first aliquot of each NPA specimen using a modified method previously published (Casas et al., 1995). Specimens were screened for the presence of 15 different respiratory viruses as previously published. Briefly, two multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used. The first assay was designed for the detection of specific viral genomes belonging to respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, adenoviruses and influenza types A, B and C (Corias et al., 2003). The second assay was designed to detect parainfluenza viruses (types 1\u20134) and human coronavirus (229E and OC43), as well as to detect enterovirus and rhinovirus polyprotein genes (Corias et al., 2004). Detection of human metapneumovirus was performed using two independent RT-nested PCR assays which spanned different genes: the matrix protein (M) and the viral polymerase (L), as described elsewhere (L\u00f3pez-Huertas et al., 2005).",

Subbarao et al. (1989) published a retrospective study of 2415 patients (both hospitalized and ambulatory) with respiratory infections, and found 666 children with RSV infection and 51 patients (7.6%) with double infections. A clinical severity score was performed, and no differences were found between these groups. These authors did not use PCR techniques, which may explain the low rate of coinfection. In a prospective study using PCR techniques on samples from infants admitted for bronchiolitis, Brouard et al. (2000) found that up to 27% of patients had coinfections. Again, no clinical differences were found between the groups. Legg et al. (2005) conducted a study in infants with respiratory infection that were receiving outpatient treatment. This study also used PCR techniques and obtained a 20% rate of double infections; moreover, there was not an increased risk of hospitalization or clinical severity. Special attention should be paid to Semple et al. (2005) which suggests that coinfection with RSV and hMPV is linked to a greater risk of requiring mechanical ventilation than simple RSV infection (18 patients vs. 7 patients) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. However, the authors were unable to find such a difference between simple (RSV) or dual (RSV and hMPV) infections in patients admitted to general wards classified either as moderate (i.e., requiring admission to the hospital without oxygen therapy) or as severe (requiring oxygen therapy). Our population is probably similar to this last group of patients admitted to general wards, and is not comparable to infants admitted to intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. Further studies with series of infants with hMPV infection have been unable to confirm these results. In previous studies conducted by our group, which involved more than 1000 infants admitted to the hospital over 5 epidemic seasons, no differences were found (Garc\u00eda et al., 2006, Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2006).",

This study was retrospective for the detection of hMPV, discovered in 2003, and no data was produce for the newly describe coronaviruses NL63 and HKU-1, and the human bocavirus. In general, the major limitation of PCR techniques is that the presence of nucleic acid of a viral pathogen is not in itself evidence of an active infection. Due to its high sensitivity, PCR might detect low amounts of viral genome from past infections. This could eventually explain the very few clinical differences between simple and multiple infections since most of them would be simple ones with rests of previous infections. This limitation is difficult to overcome at the moment since most of these viruses are difficult to grow in a cell culture. The development and validation of quantitative PCR, as well as its correlation with the clinical symptoms, might become a useful tool to clarify the actual role of multiple infections. This is one of the main goals of our research group at this moment.",
