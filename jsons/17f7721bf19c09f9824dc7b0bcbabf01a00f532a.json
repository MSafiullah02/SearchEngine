Refugees, victims of various diasporas, and massive legal and illegal immigration force intercultural contact on the peoples of different regions who had not had to deal with it previously. Such large movements of people evoke official and non-official (i.e., reactionary) responses by governments and citizens, some hospitable and some less so. Macro ageing and birth trends have prompted previously closed societies to open themselves up to 'guest workers' (e.g., Japan, Saudi Arabia, the US, and various European countries). These global trends have consequences for the provision of public services, including education.",

In the past (and seen over long periods of time), each of these social institutions served as a check on the power and influence of the others. Some historical epochs can be characterised by a relatively disproportional degree of power or influence of one or the other of these major social institutions. For example, the Enlightenment saw the decline of the power of the Catholic Church relative to the state (Sale, 1990) . We contend that today, of the three, business is the most powerful, left relatively unchecked by the state or religion. ii Economic entrepreneurialism and the penetration of local markets and the cultural changes that these forces might occasion emanate from numerous, different countries and peoples. Inglehart and Baker (Austin American-Statesman, March 19, 2000, G8) claim, for example, that 'if any societies exemplify the cutting edge of cultural change it seems to be the Nordic cultures.' It must be acknowledged, though, that these different businesses, economic concerns and their initiatives leave different 'footprints' on the local country or market.",

            "text": "The influence of business on education has been well documented (e.g., Callahan, 1962; Waite, Boone & McGhee, 2001; White, 2003) . In primary and secondary schools especially, the overall global trend is of managerialism in schools, a relatively recent phenomenon captured by the term New Public Management (Dempster, Freakley & Parry, 2001; MacBeath, Moos & Riley, 1996 , 1998 Moos, 2000) . New public management entails: a reduction in government's role in public service provision; the imposition of the strongest feasible framework of competition and accountability on public sector activity; explicit standards and measures of performance and clear definition of goals, targets or indicators of success, preferably in quantitative form; a greater emphasis on output controls-a stress on results, not processes; and a reduction in the self-regulating powers of the professions. (Dempster, Freakley & Parry, 2001, p. 2). For us, the issue is not whether new public management is a reality--for we readily accept that it is; the issue is how pervasive, how deep is its colonisation of the world of education, and, what further directions this might take. We are convinced that many social functions and their corresponding institutionseducation and schools, for example, or medicine and hospitals -are beset by what we term 'creeping managerialism.' Creeping managerialism reflects the manner in which a managerial mentality has, over time, permeated our social institutions, resulting in a domination of the managerial mindset over other possible ideologies or ways of operating (i.e., models of organisational operation). Creeping managerialism privileges decision making that is based on quantitative data, as though such decisions were value-neutral. (Schools in the US are encouraged to engage in 'data-driven decision making.') Such a model and those who apply it and/or are under its sway do not recognise it to be simply one episteme among many. Other models and modes of living/managing social institutions are outside the realm of consciousness, they are 'contained' (Popen, 2002) . Sinclair (1995) reminds us that managerial accountability is one of five typesalong with political accountability, public accountability, professional accountability, and personal accountability. So the fact that managerial accountability is prevalent in education is unremarkable. What is remarkable is the degree to which managerialism has usurped the others. Managerialism, in this sense, has become hegemonic. Additionally, and as Dempster, Freakley and Parry (2001) acknowledge, educational organisations are increasingly prone to the forces of marketisation. Competition among schools is fast becoming the rule. This competition is exacerbated by publication of league tables or school test score data (Canaan, 2002; Gillborn & Youdell, 2000; Waite, Boone & McGhee, 2001) . Provisions of the current Texas (USA) education code and the recently enacted federal legislation, \"No Child Left Behind\", permit students from so-called 'failing schools' to transfer to another school district, taking their federal funding with them.",

Among other things, education has become more of a commodity -to be bought, sold, traded, and affected by other market forces. As an example, the US is pushing for higher education to be covered by the controversial General Agreement on Trade in Services, or GATS, treaties (CAUT-ACPPU, 2002). The US goal, according to Douglas Baker, deputy assistant secretary of the US Department of Commerce, is \"'to create the conditions for international competition in education services with minimal government interference'\". According to some critics of this proposal, trade in education, of the sort proposed, increases the already-strong influence of the private sector (as noted above) and removes such education from public accountability and absolves it of public responsibility. The commodification and marketisation of education, especially in higher education, may well result in its becoming simply another means of domination, especially by the USA -a part of what Lather (2003) terms 'academic capitalism,' and what we might refer to as academic imperialism.",

The combination of the forces of maketisation, new public management, and commercialisation of education has severe ramifications for education worldwide. Government financial support for colleges and schools is being reduced. Political support for public schools, in the US at least, is being undermined. Services are evaporating. Budgetary constraints are forcing many schools to cut programs and services. The first of these to be cut are those deemed 'non-essential' -for example, programs in music and art, and even their extracurricular components. In Texas (USA), a plan was recently floated to delay purchase of social studies textbooks for public school students state-wide. Social studies texts were next in line for purchase in the state cycle, being now five years out of date. The delay was rationalised to save money during a severe state budgetary crisis as social studies is not tested through the state's accountability regime, and, therefore, the subject is deemed 'non-essential.'",

This is in keeping with the thinking of Charles Handy (1994) , who describes the future of work wherein one might use his/her office primarily as a home base, to collect mail, make telephone calls, and hold meetings. He describes organisations under current and future conditions as being donut-shaped, where the main work of an organisation is done by a core of workers and other work is done by contracted workers. Harvey (1989) , likewise, describes such organisations, which he terms 'post-Fordist.' Such contracted workers are cheaper for the organisation, as they usually are not covered by benefits. However, in higher education, such contracted workers, sometimes referred to as adjuncts, do not assist with any faculty or organisational duties other than teaching. They do not assist with governance or student committee work, as examples, leaving the full-time core faculty to carry those burdens.",

Besides, entrepreneurialism left unchecked is dangerous-to the organisational members and to the society as a whole. Schools in China were encouraged to be entrepreneurial, owing to scarce resource allotment from the central government, with the result being a recent explosion in a primary school in Jiangxi Province that killed about forty-five children (Waite & Allen, in press ). The children were being forced by their teachers to assemble fireworks to earn extra money for the teachers, the school, and the local Communist Party. This horrendous example of educators' entrepreneurial spirit was cited by Waite and Allen (in press) as one among many instances and types of corruption in education, including higher education, which they uncovered worldwide.

In parts of Australia, faculty raises are calculated as an actuarial exercise by a contracted accounting firm based on the number of publications faculty have in a given year (P. Gronn, personal communication, September 16, 2002) . A similar pressure is felt by academics in Denmark, where the faculties' contracts with the Ministry of Education state research production goals for the year. If the faculties under-perform, it affects their resource allocation; if they surpass their production goal, there are no additional monies. This situation is especially draconian in a country like Denmark, because most of the outlets for research are published in English, with US, Australian, British or Canadian norms for research publication and for what is judged to be of worth.",

Also, use of these technologies in this way allows the potential for yet another ideological penetration into our human life ways. Technologically-mediated pedagogy (or andragogy) is unlike personal, face-to-face instruction. Time-honoured pedagogical models -such as the lecture, the Socratic method, demonstration, and apprenticeships -always provide the learner with instruction in much more than the mental, cognitive, or intellectual disciplinary domain. Cultural anthropologists (e.g., Varenne & McDermott, 1999) have contributed to our understanding of learning as a process that is, above all, a social phenomenon.

Generally, we tend to operate as though our institutions and the policies that they both produce and are guided by are rational, objective, even value-neutral. But cultural anthropologists, symbolic interactionists, and social constructivists paint a different picture of organisations and their policies (Sutton & Levinson, 2001) . New work on emotions in, for example, teaching (Hargreaves, 1998; Hargreaves, Beatty, Lasky, Schmidt & James-Wilson, S., in press) and educational leadership (Beatty, 2000) point out how schools and the people who populate them are fraught with seething emotions. iii Indeed, teachers and administrators engage in an inordinate amount of emotional labour while carrying out their tasks. The psychic toll exacted of administrators under strict accountability regimes is tremendous (Nelson, 2002) . This psychic toll is more devastating for administrators concerned with social justice issues. That is, these administrators are torn between their institutional subordination to hegemonic testing regimes (and their control function) and the educational bureaucracies that perpetuate them, and their professional moral obligation to do what is in the best interests of their charges, children, when they daily witness the damage done to people-teachers and students-by out-of-control accountability/testing systems.",

The work on emotions in educational leadership and the research into its psychoanalytic dimensions, taken together with recent explorations into the spiritual aspects of educational leaders (Guare, 1995; Mayes & Mayes, 2002; Starratt, 1995) , begins to round out our understanding of leaders and leadership.

In response to global trends, other work needs to be undertaken with all due urgency. Perhaps the most pressing area of study is that of the role of ideology, especially religious ideology, on policy and educational leadership.",

Recent examples worthy of note come out of the US and the 'faith-based' initiatives of the Bush administration. Afghanistan experienced the effects of one type of an extreme religious ideological policy shift when the Taliban ruled that country. In the US, the Bush administration has exhibited similar inclinations. The Attorney General of the US under the Bush administration, John Ashcroft, has instituted daily morning prayer meetings in his office. The US Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, recently was quoted as saying that \"he favours schools that appreciate 'the values of the Christian community'\" (Austin American-Statesman, April 10, 2003, p. A2). The Bush administration is seeking to implement the so-called Mexico City rule as a condition on foreign aid. Basically, the Mexico City rule denies foreign aid for family planning programs that conduct, condone, or even mention abortion as one of their services. Given the catastrophic explosion of AIDS/HIV in developing countries and the relation between family planning, abortion, birth control and sex education, this religious-ideological criterion is noteworthy. Additionally, the Bush administration has been criticised for using ideology as a litmus test for federal appointments (Zitner, 2002) .",

Others have written of learning communities and, again from the business domain, learning organisations (Senge, 1990 ). The bureaucratic model has been much maligned of late (e.g., Clark & Meloy, 1989 ), but has proven itself to be nearly impervious to change. Clark and Meloy note how bureaucracies and their mores are barriers to educational reform. In his classic treatise on the topic, Max Weber (1946, p. 228 ) noted how: \"Once it is fully established, bureaucracy is among the social structures which are the hardest to destroy\". He continued, \"bureaucracy has been and is a power instrument of the first order-for the one who controls the bureaucratic apparatus\".",

A recent social organisation type has arisen through advances in telecommunications (especially cell phones with text messaging) and the Internet. One social observer refers to groups organised for social action through these technologies for social action as 'smart mobs' (Rheingold, as cited in Taylor, 2003) . Smart mobs have demonstrated their power and potential in helping to bring down the former Philippine President Joseph Estrada in 2001 through rapidly-organised massive demonstrations and in recent global anti-war demonstrations.
