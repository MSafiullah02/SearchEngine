We purified more than one thousand memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 or RBD antigens from 11 convalescent COVID-19 patients, and a total of 729 naturally paired heavy and light chain fragments were obtained by single B cell cloning technology. Among these, 178 recombinant monoclonal antibodies were tested positive for antigen binding, and 17 strong binders to S1 or RBD were identified with Kd(EC50) below 1 nM. Importantly, 12 antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2, with the best ones showing IC50 around 2-3 nM. From these 12 antibodies, we had tested two in authentic virus infection assay, and found one was able to effectively block live viral entry with IC50 around or below 15 nM. Interestingly, we also found a substantial portion of these antibodies crossreacting with the SARS-CoV spike protein.",

The S1 region, especially the RBD domain, primes the viral particle to human cell surface through the interaction with the receptor protein Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which then triggers infusion process primarily mediated by S2 region 6 . The primary amino acid sequences of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 76 % identity throughout the full coding regions, with 79.59 % similarity and 74% identity in RBD domains 5 . Structure analyses revealed high similarity between the spike proteins of the two viruses, and both form trimerization and interact with ACE2 through the RBD domains. In addition, recent research reported that it is difficult to distinguish exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV in serological studies using S ectodomain trimer, and they elicits neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV. Importantly, the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 was assessed at around 1.2nM 6 , 4 folds stronger than the SARS-CoV RBD. While this enhanced affinity may explain a much stronger spreading ability of SARS-CoV-2, it also suggests that finding potent neutralization antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD could be much more challenging.",

Despite of rare exceptions, such as asymptomatic carriers, exist, it is generally believed if the infected individuals could not develop effective adaptive immune responses for viral clearance to prevent sustained infection, there are high chances for transformation into severe acute respiratory infection.
