There is no specific treatment or vaccine identified and the focus has been preventive measures based on statistical and mathematical models. These have relied on analyzing the behavior of populations and characteristics of the infection and applying modelling techniques. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth. Data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 in three selected countries, Sri Lanka, Italy and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 20 th April 2020. In this study Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries. Akaike's information criteria (AIC) was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated. Log incidences over time in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreaks of countries. Hence, doubling time/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were estimated. Findings altogether demonstrate that outbreak seems extinct in Hebei-China whereas further transmissions are possible in Sri Lanka. In Italy, current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate.",

At present the pandemic was recorded total number of 2,471,136 infections and 169,006 deaths in the world [1] . Daily infections and deaths are increasing at an alarming rate. According to the situation report 93 of WHO, total confirmed cases were 84,287 and deaths were 4,642 in China as at 22 April 2020. These figures for Italy and Sri Lanka were 183,957 and 24,648 and 310 and 7 respectively. On 19 th March 2020 Italy was the country where the highest number of deaths were recorded among the other countries in the world. Since then Italy has attracted the attention of the public on its active engagement with the coronavirus. In Sri Lanka, the first infection was identified on 11 th March 2020. Afterwards as of other countries several control measures such as isolation of cases, quarantine of suspects, lockdown of the country or permitting island wide curfew, limitation of public gatherings, annunciation of social distancing, increase awareness of the disease through media and encouraging people to stay in their homes were implemented. Clearly, China was at the phase of ending epidemic when Italy entered to the phase of a growing epidemic in February 2020 and now is in its middle phase. Sri Lanka had the beginnings of the epidemic in March 2020 and is still in the early phase. Since these three countries are in the three phases of the epidemic, we decided to analyze them further and draw some conclusions.",

The pattern of the epidemiological curve is undulating and it is a challenge to determine the peak of the distribution. The estimated peak time was on 20 th April 2020 which was the last date of the data gathering of this study. This suggested that the outbreak is rapidly increasing. Therefore, only one log-linear model was fitted and shown in Figure 14 and 15. The number of COVID-19 infections is increasing at the rate of doubling in every 45 days.

Findings disclosed that the most appropriate epidemic growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The epidemiological curves of each country were analyzed to extract useful characteristics of the coronavirus outbreak. Pre-peak and post-peak log -linear models were fitted on epidemic curve to predict the spread of COVID-19 infection in future. The results show that the epidemic seems extinct in Hebei-China whereas further transmissions are possible in Sri Lanka. In Italy, current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate. Therefore, effective controlling measures need to be continued and enhance with careful supervision in order to keep the epidemic under control in Sri Lanka. In Italy, their controlling mechanisms seems to be on track and should be continued to eradicate the infection.",
