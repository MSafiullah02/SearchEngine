This includes observations on the oceans, soils, and on animals. With respect to humans, it became increasingly apparent that the species on and in our bodies make significant contributions to our health and development. These species maintain normal cell function in the gastrointestinal tract (for example, see Eckburg et al., 2005; Bik et al., 2006; Gill et al., 2006). We are also dependent on these species for the efficient digestion of food components, such as plant material and xenobiotics (Gill et al., 2006), and to ward off certain diseases. In parallel, these microbes have been associated with, and can result in, many common diseases such as cavities, stomach ulcers, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and irritable bowel syndrome (Foster et al., 2008; Dorer et al., 2009).",

The limit to culturing or 16S rRNA sequencing was primarily a reflection of the availability of molecular tools and approaches, and the cost associated with earlier versions of available sequencing technologies. The 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis invariably revealed a higher level of microbial diversity than that seen with conventional culture techniques (Gao et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2008). From the human stomach, for example, although the highly acidic environment was thought to only contain Helicobacter types, Bik et al. (2006) used 1,833 16S rRNA sequences obtained from 23 gastric endoscopic biopsy samples to identify 128 phylotypes of bacteria that potentially reside in the human stomach. The majority of these phylotypes was shown to belong to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria. This work also described that 10% of the clones represented organisms that were previously uncharacterized.",

Most of these studies that have investigated the diversity of the microbial species associated with the human body have however left important questions unanswered such as the identity of the nondominant community members and their biological roles, and which metabolic processes the populations that are present encode and carry out. In addition, the past 15 years of genomic research have made it clear that closely related species, and even species that are identical at the 16S rRNA level, can have wide variation in gene content (Perna et al., 2001; Kudva et al., 2002). Terms such as pan-genome and core-genome have been coined over the years to address the variations that are apparent in closely related species and have now been applied in a similar fashion to metagenomic populations (Callister et al., 2008; Bentley, 2009).",

            "text": "The initial publication of a shotgun sequencing of the human microbiome focused on the analysis of fecal samples from the human gastrointestinal tract (Gill et al., 2006). This study along with subsequent applications of shotgun techniques to the study of the human microbiome again highlighted the extent of microbial diversity associated with the human body (Grice et al., 2009). Gordon and co-workers, for example, investigated the interplay between the gastrointestinal ecology and energy balance of animals on a Western diet. Here they found that obesity that was induced by the diet resulted in an increased proportion of one class of the Firmicutes and that this same population could be reduced by manipulation of the diet. Transplantation of the microbial populations from the obese mice to lean germ-free mice resulted in a higher level of the deposition of fat than when these microbial populations were taken from lean donors (Turnbaugh et al., 2008). More recently, Gordon\u2019s group presented the results of a monozygotic and dizygotic twin pair study, where twins were concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers (Turnbaugh et al., 2009). The aim of this study was to address how host genotype, environmental exposure, and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome (Turnbaugh et al., 2009). The comparative analysis of fecal samples that were derived from 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. In addition, 2.14 Gb of metagenomic data was obtained from their microbiomes. The results from this analysis suggest that the gastrointestinal microbiome is shared among family members, but variations are present within each individual with respect to the lineages that can be observed. This variation was evident in both the monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. The results however suggest that there is a core functional microbiome that can vary depending on physiological states.",

The significance of the studies conducted by this group relates to how the evolution of initial studies focusing on the microbiome can result in recommendations to improve human health conditions. Their results evolved from initial metagenomic studies on human gastric samples (Manichanh et al., 2006) using fosmid libraries from six healthy patients, and six patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). The group was able to identify 125 nonredundant ribotypes mainly represented by the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, of which 43 distinct ribotypes were identified in the healthy microbiota, and only 13 in CD. This metagenomic approach that was initially published gave the first insight into the reduced microbial diversity in patients with CD.",

The project has a heavy sequencing and data analysis component that currently is underway at the four large NHGRI/NIAID-funded sequencing centers (J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), Baylor College of Medicine, The Broad Institute and Washington University). The current sequencing focus includes generating at least 3000 reference genomes at various levels of finishing (Chain et al., 2009), coupled with significant 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic sequencing from 15 to 18 body sites on 300 individuals some of which would be repeat sample donors (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/). A number of \u201cInvestigator\u201d-driven demonstration projects have also been awarded. These demonstration projects aim to understand the implications of a number of diseases including CD, BV, psoriasis, and esophageal cancer to name a few (Peterson et al., 2009). It is anticipated that the results from these demonstration projects will give additional insights into the relationship between human health and disease and changes in the human microbiome. Finally, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) roadmap initiative has awarded funds to investigate new technologies for improving knowledge of the human microbiome, as well as for the development of computational tools that will increase the value of metagenomic data (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/fundedresearch.asp), and the ethical, legal, and social implications of this work.",

Such cases of unknown and potentially pathogenic microorganisms in circulation in the human population are usually favored by factors related to (1) the ability of microorganisms to adapt in new hosts, (2) human actions (interactions with wild animals, hunting and effects on the environment leading to ecological disturbances), and (3) human movements as a result of global world travel (Field, 2009). Consequently, at any particular time, there could be a set of known and unknown microorganisms present in a given individual or a population as a result of their presence in and interaction with a specific environment or organisms therein such as animal reservoirs (i.e., bats, mice, and rats) of known and unknown microorganisms. The main challenge in the context of forecasting, and better yet preventing emerging and reemerging infectious diseases has been early detection and genetic identification of such known and unknown microorganisms. Global human microbiome studies using metagenomics analysis of known and unknown microorganisms provide unique but powerful opportunities to uncover the near-complete composition of the microbial content of an individual or a population at any given time, thus setting the stage for a comprehensive inventory of the genetic characteristics of potential human pathogens.",

Such initiatives will not only provide insights into the resident and transient microbial populations but also, in the case of natural reservoirs of given microorganisms, provide an opportunity to pinpoint the genetic changes that must occur for their adaptation to a new host \u2013 the human body.

Unfortunately, available microarray-based platforms to identify strain diversity have not been fully implemented with the greatest TB incidence largely due the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The renewed interest and funding for top infectious diseases has recently revamped efforts to accelerate TB research, with a particular focus on the use of integrated approaches to find better control measures. In this context, it is proposed and highly anticipated that key aspects such as the integration of large-scale \u201comics,\u201d datasets focusing on parasite genetic determinants, host genetics, and host\u2013parasite interactions will be crucial for this quest for better control measures. In addition, and given recent reports, the human microbiome would be a great addition to this integration of data in the context of systems biology. To this end, the evaluation of the human microbiome in cases of latent, nonlatent TB, and drug-resistant TB infections will provide insights into the role of the human (resident and nonresident) flora in various aspects of TB infections. Such information would most likely contribute to improving diagnosis, control, and spread of TB infection.",

Many animals including rodents and dogs are known to be reservoirs of Leptospira, and humans are considered to be the accidental hosts of this pathogen. Transmission of the pathogen is primarily from soil and water to mammalian tissues (often noticed following on large-scale flooding), with the infection occurring via penetrating leptospires through mucosa or open skin. Symptoms of leptospirosis include meningitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis, erythema nodosum, and death. No human vaccine against leptospirosis is available, and mild leptospirosis is treated with doxycycline, ampicillin, or amoxicillin. For severe leptospirosis, the primary therapy is penicillin G.

In addition, the availability of these genomes is allowing for the identification of novel virulence factors, and ultimately will facilitate vaccine development. Recently, the genome sequence of the free-living L. biflexa was completed (Picardeau et al., 2008) and shown to contain 3,590 protein-coding genes distributed across three circular replicons. In the current study, it has been estimated that 2,052 genes (61%) represent a progenitor genome that existed before divergence of pathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira species. Basically, nearly one-third of the L. biflexa genes are absent in pathogenic Leptospira. In addition, 1,431 pathogen specific genes that are found in the pathogenic Leptospires are not present in L. biflexa. Of these, 893 genes have no known function suggesting that there are mechanisms that are unique to Leptospira and that the pathogenic specific genes need further study. The resulting genome studies suggest that there is still a significant amount of information that is not understood about the Leptospiras, particularly as it relates to how the species adapts to new environments and how the genomes mutate. Metagenomic studies of samples derived from infected populations will present an opportunity to study the pathogen without repeated passage where it has been shown to have genome rearrangements. In parallel, the pathogen can be studied directly in the environment when it is in transition from its natural host to humans (the accidental host). Interestingly, there is a large NIAID-funded project underway at the JCVI to sequence the genomes of an additional 400 Leptospira isolates (Joe Vinetz, personal communication; http://gsc.jcvi.org/).",

Genomics approaches have already been used to elucidate the genomes of several of the Plasmodium species (Gardner et al., 2002; Carlton et al., 2008; Pain et al., 2008; Mitsui et al., 2009), but new metagenomics approaches present opportunities to monitor the impact of the parasite of the microbial communities that reside on and in the human body, with a longer-term potential to develop novel probiotic approaches to supplement nutrition of infected individuals while the parasite runs its course.",

In addition, genomic studies on the environments, in which the mosquitoes reside and breed, are being and will continue to allow for an increased understanding of the communities that they require for their survival (Ponnusamy et al., 2008a, b, 2009). This is particularly relevant since mosquitoes breed in areas where there are wet conditions, and the transmission of the disease can differ according to local factors such as rainfall, proximity of mosquito breeding sites to people, and the mosquito species in the area. A November 2009 report from Susan Anyangu in Nairobi, Kenya, carried by Inter Press Service (IPS) states that the RTS.S vaccine being developed is to be used specifically in Africa. It will be for infants and children aged less than 5 years (the most vulnerable to malaria). The vaccine could be ready for use in 5 years time.",

Although the benefits of probiotics are evident, they have yet to be adapted extensively in the developing world (Reid and Devillard, 2004). Other ideas on the use of probiotics for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS have been explored and proposed (Reid et al., 2005) where it has been proposed that lactic acid bacteria could play a role in maintaining the health of the human gut. We can only hope that as a result of the initiatives of the human microbiome project, new probiotics for a range of human health conditions may be developed based on baselines for people in different geographic locales.",
