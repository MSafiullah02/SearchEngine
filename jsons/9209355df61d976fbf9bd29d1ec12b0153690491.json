(15) Since in the current study we used high-quality and fast HRCT machines, but the scans were not ECG-triggered nor contrast medium used, we customized the methods otherwise typically used for PCAT measurement; we manually identified the coronary artery lumen and adjusted the vessel contours. The left anterior coronary artery (LAD) was the only coronary artery vessel reliably visualized in most patients (less motion artifacts compared with right coronary artery) in the non-contrast, non ECG-triggered HRCT datasets for the aim of PCAT measurement. Figure 1 shows the technical steps to measure PCAT attenuation. We traced the proximal 40-mm segment of the LAD and 3-dimensional layers within radial distance from the outer coronary wall equal in thickness to the average diameter of the vessel were constructed automatically, using the abovementioned semiautomated software Within the predefined volume of interest, voxels with tissue attenuation ranging from -190 up to -30 HU were considered as adipose tissue. We quantified the mean PCAT attenuation based on the attenuation histogram of peri-coronary fat within the range -190 HU to -30 HU. (10,15,16)",

The means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed, otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c7 2 test, although the Fisher exact test was used when data were limited. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the demographic and clinical variables, laboratory variables and, as a final step, HRCT variables and the primary end point of death. Variables that were not normally distributed (such as CCS, C-reactive protein, D-dimer) were log-transformed, as is standard. We considered an increase in PCAT attenuation in steps of 1 HU and 5 HU; the results were similar and increase by 5 HU were reported for multivariable analysis.

The finding that a higher coronary inflammation status in COVID-19 patients is associated with mortality is instead a novel finding and may shed some light on the possible mechanisms responsible for the frequently-found myocardial injury, associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients.(4-7) However, the current study did not address the incidence of myocardial injury (cardiac troponins were not routinely measured in our COVID-19 cohort), so that while we can affirm that coronary inflammation is associated with in-hospital death, we cannot speculate on the relation between coronary inflammation and myocardial injury. The finding of a disproportionate increase in Creactive protein, together with higher PCAT in patients with fatal outcome, supports the existing hypothesis that inflammation in COVID-19 is a key driver of outcome, being a possible mechanism of coronary plaque destabilization, as well as a potential trigger for cardiac arrhythmias.(18) This opens the possibility that the potent anti-inflammatory drugs already in testing phase in prospective trials may help decrease mortality.",

The use of HRCT as an initial gatekeeper, as performed in the current study in presence of symptoms and signs suggestive of the disease, may prove useful during massive outbreaks, as the one the world is facing. In an outbreak setting the inherently limited specificity of HRCT (which aims at the detection of a typical interstitial pneumonia, and not specifically at the detection of the virus) is sufficient to produce a moderate-to-high positive predictive value, due to the high prevalence of disease (high pre-test probability). In turn, HRCT has a very high sensitivity and negative predictive value, which may be preferable in the gatekeeping setting of highly contagious diseases. (19) .

The current study also demonstrated that HRCT is capable to accurately risk-stratify patients with acute respiratory distress and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 through simple semi-quantitative estimation of the extent of lung parenchyma affected by pneumonia, which represents the pulmonary key clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Interestingly, such risk-stratification capability, although to a lesser degree, was demonstrated also in patients in whom viral nucleic acid was not detected in at least two nasopharyngeal swabs (Figure 2 ).
