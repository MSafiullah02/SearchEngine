Coronaviruses have a major surface (S) spike glycoprotein that mediates binding and entry of the virus into host cells [8] [9] [10] . The S glycoprotein interacts with a specific cellular receptor and, consequently, defines the host range and cytotropism of coronaviruses [11] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metallopeptidase, has been identified as a SARS-CoV receptor, and its pattern of tissue expression matches the sites of virus recovery from infected individuals [12] . We, as well as others [13, 14] , have shown that the minimal region of binding of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is contained within aa 270-510. We therefore have targeted this region in the development of neutralizing antibodies for use in the prevention of SARS and possibly the treatment of patients with SARS. In the present study, we describe the characterization of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against 2 epitopes on the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and their efficacy in protecting mice against challenge with live virus.",

Vero E6 cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well, in 96well microtiter plates, on assay day \u03ea1 in a volume of 100 mL. On assay day 0, antibody dilutions were preincubated for 1 h with 100 TCID 50 of virus stock (Urbani strain; generously provided by Larry Anderson [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta]). These mixtures of virus and antibody dilutions then were added to cells in replicates of 2 or 3. One additional set of antibody dilutions without virus was included as a control, to detect toxicity. Positive and negative controls (rabbit anti-S 1190 and rabbit preimmune serum, respectively) were included in each assay. Virus stock was back titrated in each assay, to ensure that the inoculum was 30-300 TCID 50 / well. Presence or absence of cytopathic effect (CPE) after 72 h of incubation was determined by microscopy. Neutralizingantibody assays to titer mouse serum were done in a microneutralization assay using 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cell monolayers, by use of 4 wells per dilution on a 96-well plate. The presence of viral CPE was read on days 3 and 4. The dilution of serum that completely prevented CPE in 50% of the wells was calculated by means of the Reed-Muench formula [17] . After microscopic visualization of CPE, medium was replaced by PBS, CellTiter96 reagent (Promega) was added, and plates were incubated for 2-4 h until gradations of color between uninfected and infected controls were easily distinguished visually. CellTiter96 is metabolized to a soluble, colored product, the concentration of which is proportional to the number of viable cells in the culture. Absorbance is reduced in wells with significant CPE. To inactivate virus, 10% SDS was added, and the absorbance (optical density measured at 490 nm) was read by use of a universal plate reader (EL 800; Bio-Tek Instruments). Percent protective effect was calculated as follows: 100(observed \u03ea maximum CPE)/(minimum CPE \u03ea maximum CPE), where \"maximum CPE\" refers to absorbance in control wells with virus and no MAb and \"minimum CPE\" refers to absorbance in control wells with no virus and no MAb.",

Specifically, tiny foci of CPE were observed in nearly every well with a high concentration of MAb 68. In contrast, no CPE was observed in the wells with high concentrations of MAb 201 (figure 2B).

Mice were given purified MAb, by ip injection, on the day before challenge with 10 5 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) and were killed 2 days after challenge. Nonimmune sera from uninfected mice and an irrelevant MAb (Palivizumab [Medimmune], which is specific for RSV infection) were used as controls. Blood was collected just prior to challenge, and serum neutralizing titers in mice treated with 40 mg/kg MAb 201 were determined to be 1:16. The neutralization of virus by sera from mice treated with MAb 68 was incomplete; at the lowest dilutions, CPE was noted to be limited and patchy, which was similar to the pattern of neutralization by MAb 68 described in figure 2 .",

A suggestion of a greater protective effect with MAb 201 than with MAb 68 was found, as judged by the differences in the reduction of virus titers at 8 mg/kg; however, the number of observations was too small to show significant differences between the MAbs.",

Despite these differences in protein recognition, both MAbs protected mice in a model of virus challenge. The mechanism of neutralization for MAb 201, which bound to aa 490-510, is most likely a direct interference of binding of virus S glycoprotein to its receptor, ACE2. Neutralization and protection of mice by MAb 68, which bound to aa 130-150 but failed to block S 590 binding to Vero E6 cells, must involve a different mechanism. The simplest explanation would be interference with the conformational changes that are required for virus-cell membrane fusion to occur after binding to ACE2. Additional possible mechanisms include (1) alterations in physical properties of SARS-CoV (e.g., aggregation) and (2) interference with an as-yetunrecognized coreceptor.",

We emphasize that this model does not allow conclusions regarding modification of SARS or prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV. Nonetheless, a reasonable hypothesis is that these effects could be achieved, given the results of preclinical and clinical testing of the MAb Palivizumab in the prevention of RSV disease. In animal models of RSV infection, Palivizumab does not prevent infection but significantly reduces virus titers [20] . Large clinical trials have established that modification of disease and prevention of transmission can be achieved by treating infants at risk for RSV infection and disease with Palivizumab (reviewed in [21] ).",
