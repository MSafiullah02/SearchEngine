            "text": "The initiation of protein synthesis is a complex process that is a major target for the regulation of gene expression at the translational level. Two major mechanisms for the initiation of mRNA translation are known in eukaryotic cells: cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-driven translation. The first one of these mechanisms involves the recognition of the methylated cap structure m7GpppN located at the 5\u2032 end of eukaryotic mRNAs by the initiation factor eIF4E, that together with eIF4G and eIF4A form the eIF4F multiprotein complex (Jackson et al., 2010, Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009). After binding of this complex to the cap structure, the interaction of the small ribosomal subunit 40S containing several initiation factors (eIFs), such as eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3 and eIF2 is promoted. The initiator Met-tRNAi\nMet interacts with eIF2 and together with GTP form the ternary complex that is located close to the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Binding of eIF3 to the middle domain of eIF4G establishes the interaction of the preinitiation complex 43 S at the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs bearing the cap structure (Lorsch and Dever, 2010). Afterwards, the 40S subunit scans the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the mRNA until an AUG initiation codon is found within a good initiation context (Hinnebusch, 2011, Valasek, 2012). The secondary structure of the 5\u2032 UTR is melted during the scanning process in part by the helicase activity of eIF4A (Parsyan et al., 2011). The eIF4F complex represents a key target for the regulation of translation and most particularly the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E, that takes place by a motif sequence Y(X)4LF, where X is variable and F is hydrophobic (Mader et al., 1995, Morino et al., 2000). The rate-limiting factor of the eIF4F complex is eIF4E, whose involvement in translation is regulated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (Gingras et al., 1999, Mamane et al., 2006). The activity of eIF4E is controlled by several proteins able to bind to this factor, i.e. the eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs). This interaction is regulated by the mTOR pathway that induces 4E-BP phosphorylation, blocking in this manner the interaction between eIF4E and 4E-BP and leaving free eIF4E to bind eIF4G. Thus, the interaction sites of eIF4G and 4E-BPs on eIF4E are overlapping (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999, Richter and Sonenberg, 2005).",

Picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or poliovirus (PV), mRNA do not contain a cap structure and therefore does not require eIF4E to initiate translation. Instead, the C-terminal two-thirds of eIF4G bound to eIF4A are necessary for the initiation of translation of picornavirus mRNA (Gingras et al., 1999). Other animal viruses that contain capped mRNAs may not require eIF4E for their translation in infected cells. This is the case for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNAs (Connor and Lyles, 2002, Welnowska et al., 2009) or Sindbis virus (SV) subgenomic 26S mRNA (sgmRNA) (Castello et al., 2006, Sanz et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Selective inhibitors of protein synthesis have proven to be useful tools to help unravel the exact mechanism of mRNA translation (Vazquez, 1979). Classically, these inhibitors were derived from natural compounds, while in recent years more elegant and sophisticated screening methods are being used to identify inhibitors of the initiation step of translation (Cencic et al., 2011b, Moerke et al., 2007, Novac et al., 2004). High throughput screening of small molecule libraries has provided novel molecules that selectively block the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E. One of these molecules, 4EGI-1, identified as an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, not only interferes with the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G but also paradoxically increases the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E (Moerke et al., 2007). This commercially available compound is being employed in several laboratories to analyze biological processes related to protein synthesis. For example, 4EGI-1 impairs long-term associative memory consolidation (Hoeffer et al., 2011, Hoeffer et al., 2013), and may provide beneficial effects for the autistic-like behavior observed in eIF4E-transgenic mice (Santini et al., 2013). Furthermore, eIFs are overexpressed or activated in several human cancers, and inhibition of translation by 4EGI-1 induces apoptosis-mediated cell death in a number of myeloma cells lines (Descamps et al., 2012). In addition, 4EGI-1 has been shown to inhibit growth of human breast and melanoma cancer xenografts without apparent toxicity (Chen et al., 2012). However, 4EGI-1 abrogated the growth and induced apoptosis of human lung cancer cells by a mechanism independent from the interference with cap-dependent translation (Fan et al., 2010). Protein synthesis in cultured cells is strongly reduced by 4EGI-1 leading to accumulation of 80S ribosomes, a phenomenon not observed after depletion of eIF4E (Mokas et al., 2009). In a thorough study on the action of 4EGI-1 on protein synthesis, it was demonstrated that inhibition of translation by this compound was unrelated to its interference with the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G (McMahon et al., 2011). Thus, the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 only partially blocked overall translation in primary human cells after disruption of eIF4E binding to eIF4G, whereas 4EGI-1 potently blocked cellular protein synthesis without interfering with the eIF4F complex. Notably, this inhibition was readily reversible even after a prolonged incubation of several days, despite the fact that protein synthesis was strongly diminished. In addition, 4EGI-1 potently blocks poxvirus replication as well as both the reactivation and lytic phases of herpesvirus infection (McMahon et al., 2011). In the present work we have tested the efficacy of 4EGI-1 to inhibit viral mRNA translation. Curiously, VSV and SV protein synthesis, that do not employ eIF4E, are inhibited to a similar extent as cellular mRNA translation. In addition, PV(IRES)-driven translation is also blocked by 4EGI-1, even after cleavage of eIF4G by PV 2Apro. These findings demonstrate that 4EGI-1 can inhibit translation even when this process is independent of eIF4E.",

            "text": "As 4EGI-1 is thought to be a selective inhibitor of the translation initiation factor eIF4E, we tested its efficacy against different mRNA templates. Initially, the action of this molecule was assayed in the translation of cap-luc, PV(IRES)-luc, EMCV(IRES)-luc and CrPV IGR-luc mRNAs. In principle, only cap-luc requires eIF4E for translation, while the other mRNAs do not. RRL programmed with mRNA was thus incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of 4EGI-1 and assayed for synthesis of luciferase protein. As shown in\nFig. 1, synthesis of luciferase directed by cap-luc mRNA was sensitive to 4EGI-1, with a 40% reduction in translation at 60 \u03bcM, and greater than 90% reduction at 120 \u03bcM. In contrast, translation directed by mRNAs bearing EMCV IRES or CrPV IGR was more resistant to 4EGI-1, however, there was a significant reduction in translation, of approximately 50\u201360%, at 120 \u03bcM. Interestingly, CrPV IGR translation does not require any of the canonical eIFs (Deniz et al., 2009, Wilson et al., 2000) and so this partial inhibition of translation by 4EGI-1 was unexpected. Most probably, the rather high concentrations of 4EGI-1 used to interfere with other translation processes, independent from initiation. Surprisingly, luciferase synthesis directed by PV(IRES)-luc mRNA was more sensitive to 4EGI-1 inhibition than cap-luc mRNA (Fig. 1) with an inhibition of 85% at 90 \u03bcM.",

            "text": "It has previously been suggested that the partial inhibition of EMCV IRES-driven translation by 4EGI-1 may be due to the fact that this mRNA uses the eIF4F complex for its translation, and the inhibition of eIF4E binding to eIF4G may alter the functionality of this complex devoid of eIF4E (Moerke et al., 2007). To test this possibility, we analyzed the effect of 4EGI-1 after cleavage of eIF4G by picornavirus proteases. It is well established that EMCV and PV IRESs are efficiently translated when eIF4G has been cleaved by picornavirus proteases 2Apro or Lpro (Castello et al., 2011, Gingras et al., 1999). Under these conditions, the N-terminal moiety of eIF4G that interacts with eIF4E does not participate in translation. Therefore, protein synthesis directed by those mRNAs bearing the picornavirus IRESs, does not employ eIF4E after eIF4G cleavage. As expected, pretreatment of RRL with FMDV Lpro or with HRV 2Apro led to cleavage of eIF4G (\nFig. 2A and B, lower panels). Under these conditions, translation directed by PV(IRES)-luc mRNA was inhibited by 4EGI-1 to a similar extent as when eIF4G remained intact (Fig. 2A and B). Therefore, the blockade of PV(IRES)-luc mRNA translation by this compound is not due to the lack of interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G.",

Transfection was carried out for 2 h, followed by a medium exchange with addition of 4EGI-1, and a further 90 min of incubation. Under these experimental conditions, translation of cap-luc, EMC(IRES)-luc and PV(IRES)-luc mRNAs were inhibited by approximately 50% with 150 \u03bcM 4EGI-1, while CrPV IGR-luc mRNA was inhibited by approximately 20% (\nFig. 3A). Notably, we have found that when 4EGI-1 is present during transfection, the inhibition of luc synthesis is much stronger than if the molecule is added after the transfected cells are washed in fresh medium. Under these conditions, translation of cap-luc mRNA and PV(IRES)-luc is inhibited by 50% with 15 \u03bcM 4EGI-1. Similarly, a 50% inhibition of CrPV IGR-luc mRNA translation occurs with 15 \u03bcM 4EGI-1, and EMCV(IRES)-luc mRNA translation is blocked by 25% with the same concentration of inhibitor. Increasing the inhibitor concentration to 30 \u03bcM abolished translation of all mRNAs except in the case of CrPV IGR-luc mRNA, which was inhibited by 80%. At 60 \u03bcM 4EGI-1, translation is totally abrogated with all mRNAs tested when the inhibitor is added to the transfection mixture (Fig. 3B). A possible explanation for this result could be that 4EGI-1 enters more efficiently into cells undergoing transfection.",

Transfection of PV(IRES)-luc mRNA, followed by addition of 4EGI-1 to 90 \u03bcM, indicates that mRNA translation is strongly inhibited (approximately 70%) in the absence of PV 2Apro. However, when eIF4G has been cleaved, the inhibition is reduced to approximately 40%. When 4EGI-1 is added during transfection, there is a profound arrest of PV(IRES)-luc mRNA translation, irrespective of the presence or absence of PV 2Apro (Fig. 3C). Therefore, 4EGI-1 could block translation of PV(IRES)-luc mRNA in cells despite eIF4G cleavage, indicating that this inhibition takes place by a mechanism different from the abrogation of eIF4E activity.",

Therefore, the effect of 4EGI-1 was next analyzed in cells infected with animal viruses that, in principle, do not employ eIF4E. For this purpose, BHK-21 cells were infected with SV, VSV and EMCV. In this case, we employed concentrations of 4EGI-1 between 30 and 60 \u03bcM, which is the range in which cellular mRNA translation is sensitive to inhibition. It should be noted that these cells have not been treated with lipofectamine. As indicated previously, the inhibitor presumably enters into cells much better in the presence of the transfectant, whereas cells are more refractory to 4EGI-1 entry after lipofectamine treatment (Fig. 3).\nFig. 4A shows that 30 \u03bcM 4EGI-1 diminished protein synthesis in control BHK-21 cells by 40% and this inhibition increased to more than 70% at 60 \u03bcM 4EGI-1. A similar inhibition of translation was found with SV and VSV (Fig. 4B and C, respectively) while EMCV protein synthesis was more resistant (Fig. 4D). However, a 50% inhibition of EMCV translation was observed at 50\u201360 \u03bcM 4EGI-1. Since none of these three animal viruses requires eIF4E during infection, we can conclude that the inhibition of viral mRNA translation by 4EGI-1 is not due to the lack of interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G.",

            "text": "Previous work, as well as our current findings, indicated that 4EGI-1 interfered with translation directed by IRES-containing mRNAs (Moerke et al., 2007). These results, together with the observations that cellular protein synthesis was blocked by 4EGI-1 at concentrations below those affecting the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G (McMahon et al., 2011), suggest that this inhibitor functions at a still unidentified step in initiation or elongation. To test if 4EGI-1 inhibited the elongation phase of translation in BHK-21 cells, we measured the synthesis of cellular proteins during a short time period (15 min). Under these conditions, protein labeling with radioactive methionine is due mainly to elongation. Thus, cycloheximide potently blocked protein synthesis under these conditions (\nFig. 7, lane 2), while hippuristanol at concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2 \u03bcM did not affect translation (Fig. 7, lanes 5 and 6). Preincubation of BHK cells with hippuristanol for 1 h before radioactive labeling strongly blocked cellular protein synthesis (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4). When 4EGI-1 was present during only 15 min, there was a significant inhibition of translation, and this inhibition was greater when the compound was preincubated for 1 h prior to protein labeling (Fig. 7, lanes 10\u201312 and lanes 7\u20139, respectively). Thus, 30 \u03bcM 4EGI-1 diminished protein synthesis by 46%, and this inhibition was above 90% when the compound was preincubated for 1 h. These findings show that 4EGI-1 has a partial inhibitory effect on the elongation of protein synthesis, aside from its blockade on the initiation of mRNA translation.",

            "text": "The search for new translation inhibitors has produced in recent years several promising compounds that selectively block this process at the initiation level. This is the case for hippuristanol which specifically abrogates eIF4A activity (Bordeleau et al., 2006, Garcia-Moreno et al., 2013, Lindqvist et al., 2008). Other recently described inhibitors of initiation include 4E1RCat and 4E2RCat, which interfere with the binding of eIF4G\u2013eIF4E, and also abrogate the interaction between eIF4E and 4E-BP1 (Cencic et al., 2011a). 4E2RCat also decreases coronavirus replication (Cencic et al., 2011b). In the present work, we have analyzed the efficacy of the protein synthesis inhibitor 4EGI-1 on mRNA translation of different animal viruses. Curiously, it has been described that this inhibitor blocks eIF4G-eIF4E interaction, but stimulates binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (Moerke et al., 2007). These results suggest that the binding region of 4E1RCat and 4EGI-1 to eIF4E may overlap, but are distinct (Cencic et al., 2011a). Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of each of these inhibitors with regards to the eIF4G-eIF4E interaction as well as their consequent biological effects, may differ. It is important to precisely establish the mechanism of action of these compounds during protein synthesis, since they are increasingly used to analyze several cellular and viral functions. Indeed, 4EGI-1 exhibits interesting antiviral and antitumor activities (Chen et al., 2012, McMahon et al., 2011). Moreover, this compound has also promising activity in a mice model for autism (Santini et al., 2013). Previous work to interpret the mode of action of 4EGI-1 revealed that this compound blocks translation at concentrations that do not disrupt the eIF4F complex (McMahon et al., 2011). In good agreement with those results, we also describe in this work that cellular translation is blocked at concentrations lower than those required to block eIF4G-eIF4E interaction. In this regard, our present findings clearly demonstrate that 4EGI-1 restricts protein synthesis despite the fact that eIF4E supposedly does not participate in translation of some viral mRNAs. As we have shown, this inhibitor strongly blocks in vitro translation directed by PV(IRES)-luc mRNA, a process in which eIF4E would not be necessary. Furthermore, this inhibition is similar when eIF4G remains intact or after its cleavage by picornavirus proteases.",

            "text": "Several domains have been recognized in eIF4G through molecular analysis (Gingras et al., 1999, Marcotrigiano et al., 1999). The N-terminal one-third of eIF4G is responsible for its interaction with eIF4E, while the other two-thirds can participate in IRES-driven translation by several mRNAs (De Gregorio et al., 1999, Pestova et al., 2001). Some picornavirus proteases, such as HRV or PV 2Apro, proteolytically cleave eIF4G releasing the N-terminal one third of this factor (Belsham, 2009, Castello et al., 2011). Translation of mRNAs bearing EMCV or PV IRES takes place efficiently in the presence of the distal two-thirds-containing C-terminus of eIF4G (Castello et al., 2011, Hundsdoerfer et al., 2005, Pestova et al., 2001). Under these conditions, eIF4E is not required for this translation. Therefore, picornavirus proteases are particularly useful to analyze selective inhibitors of the eIF4E\u2013eIF4G interaction. Our present observations demonstrating that 4EGI-1 impairs PV IRES-driven translation in the presence of picornavirus 2Apro clearly indicate that this molecule affects other steps in the translation process different to its activity against eIF4E. In addition, the finding that 4EGI-1 blocks VSV and SV sgmRNA translation, adds further support to this assertion. It has been well established that initiation of mRNA translation in VSV-infected cells is independent of eIF4E and an intact eIF4F complex (Connor and Lyles, 2002, Welnowska et al., 2009). This has also been observed for translation of SV sgmRNA (Castello et al., 2006, Sanz et al., 2009). It has been proposed that the inhibitory activity of 4EGI-1 could be mediated by the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in initiation complexes (McMahon et al., 2011). The presence of inactive eIF2 in initiation complexes, together with eIF4F complex may reflect the impairment in the recycling of eIFs. If so, inhibition of the recycling of eIFs may account for the inhibitory effect of PV IRES-driven translation, as described in this work. Translation of SV sgmRNA takes place even when phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is induced by several compounds (Sanz et al., 2009). Moreover, picornavirus translation can occur even when eIF2\u03b1 becomes phosphorylated, particularly when eIF4G has been cleaved by picornavirus proteases (Redondo et al., 2012, Redondo et al., 2011, Welnowska et al., 2011). Even though translation of these mRNAs is independent of eIF2, 4EGI-1 potently blocks SV and picornavirus mRNA translation. In part, this inhibition could be due to the interference of this inhibitor with the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Also, the interference with the recycling of initiation factors due to the accumulation of initiation complexes bearing phosphorylated eIF2 could account for the inhibitory effect of 4EGI-1 on the initiation phase. On the other hand, the activity of 4EGI-1 on elongation can account for the decrease observed in translation directed by IRESs from CrPV or EMCV (Moerke et al., 2007).",
