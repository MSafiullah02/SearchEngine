This virus strain ears a striking resemblance to the 21 st century viruses like SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV). COVID19 is reported to be a zoonotic virus, with bats being the possible origin and pangolins as probable intermediate host. The first transmission probably occurred in an exotic meat rich wet market in Wuhan, China. Following this animal-to-human transmission, the COVID19 has been spread by human-to-human contact. The interpersonal contact occurs mainly via respiratory droplets/aerosols, saliva and or contact. The role of fecal-oral transmission, through fomites or vertical transmission are yet to be confirmed.",

All other practice settings, excluding postgraduate students(trainees) and consultants, would have additional avenues of income. Endodontists who rely exclusively on consultations, would not have means or would find it very difficult to practice endodontics during COVID19 situation. This sudden, downward spiral in income could be major driving force for the elevated (dis)stress in this subgroup. It is also observed that trainee endodontists also have elevated risk of stress as compared to solo practitioners. It has been documented that the dental students have higher stress. (Knipe et al., 2018) In the present situation, shifting to a different platform of education, risk of contagion, fear or uncertainty of education and future practice avenues may cause an acute stress on the endodontic trainees/residents.

As compared to public, there is 235% more prevalence of stress among Indian endodontists. Those endodontists that are either trainee or those who exclusively go for consultations, females and younger aged have higher risk for (dis)stress. The endodontic and dental key opinion leaders need to factor in the high degree of (dis)stress among endodontists, evolve policies and guidelines such that there is provision for care after the initial coping. They need to work with authorities to develop and coordinate profession focused psychological first aid with adequate space for monitoring, screening, referral and targeted intervention such that the (dis)stress is reduced. The focus should be developing COVID19 lock down exit strategies for dentists, formulating better working protocols for sterilization/disinfection, cheaper, faster, reliable screening and diagnostic tools, making barrier materials available and a robust mental health support system. .

Even in such instances, strict and effective infection control protocols were to be followed.(Amber et al., 2020; Dave et al., 2020; Farooq and Ali, 2020) In spite of such universal precautions, when a COVID19 patient or a carrier is treated, the risk of aerosol induced spread of virus appears to higher, creating numerous hot-sites of virus deposition in the operatory.(Guo et al., 2020; Veena et al., 2015) Among dentists, there is a constant, looming anxiety of encountering a COVID19 infected patient especially when there is lack or limited of access to personal protective equipment, no proper standard",

This includes social isolation, interpersonal distancing, heightened need for infection control procedures domestics and at dental operatory, fear of contagion, public perception of COVID19 stigma, concerns for self/family wellbeing, potential of acing emotionally charged clinical environments, possible unrealistic public expectations, prevalent cynicism, possibility of patient safety incidents, procedural errors, decreased access to protection gears, lower quality of para-service provision, along with core issues of financial insecurity and potential loss of income.(Gavin et al., 2020) Economic impact of COVID19 pandemic is at a personal, community, national and global level. This burden cannot be underestimated, as it could potentially influence on all other spheres of life.(Mckee and Stuckler, 2020) Dentists and Endodontists, as an integral part of the society, are not immune from all these impacts. There is dearth of evidence of perceived stress(PS) and distress among dentists, particularly among endodontists, (irrespective of COVID19 exposure) who are at the highest risk of cross infection.(Coulthard, 2020) For this very purpose, we used two scales, a time tested PSS scale and new, COVID19 specific CPDI scale were used. Both have been used and published in peer reviewed literature and been accepted, with the former being used for more than three decades.(Cohen et al., 1983; Qiu et al., 2020) Asthere was a statistically significant correlation, it could be safely inferred that the COVID19 scale is reflective of the self-reported psychological distress in COVID19 situation.

Like the Chinese study, Indian Women endodontists had higher extent of stress while age group is not in agreement with Chinese study.(Qiu et al., 2020) Like the Iranian finding, the predictors of distress in India vary from those in China and Iran.(Afshar Jahanshahi et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) When the PSS was employed, 80%(69.28%-moderate; 10.75%-severe) of Indian endodontists suffered from stress during COVID19 situation. This is 235% higher than that of the Indian general public during the same situation.(Roy et al., 2020) The PS proportions are similar to Chinese HCW who were exposed to COVID19 patients.(Lai et al., 2020) Rubber dam usage among Indian endodontics is skewed, with only 6.48% of the cohort regularly using it. Also, there are conflicting evidences about the rubber dam's efficacy in alteration microbial load in aerosols as compared to non-rubber dam use.(Al-Amad et al., 2017; Samaranayake et al., 1989) Hence, rubber dam usage characteristic was not used in further analysis.",

The financial uncertainty that the present COVID19 brings could be a possible reason to this phenomenon.(Farooq and Ali, 2020) Area of practice was significant in association for PSS while for CPDI it was not. [Table-2] India is known to have skewed distribution of dentist and the urban-rural divide exists for a variety of reasons.(Mahal and Shah, 2006) Possibly, the variation in demographics and dominant stressors could also contribute to this phenomenon. As there was not much significance, this factor was eliminated from further analysis. Experience post-MDS and age appears to be highly related in terms of clinical decision making skills and job satisfaction, perhaps that comes with experiencing different clinical situations and facing oddsclinically as well at personal front. Hence, with increasing experience, endodontists would be more likely to handle stress efficiently than a novice.(Alani et al., 2011; Dechouniotis et al., 2010) In the present study, experience in endodontics had significant magnitude of association, especially postgraduate students and <5 years of experience. Since experience post-MDS and age were collinear, this was not included in subsequent model analysis. Practice setting had a significant influence on the model wherein Endodontists who were exclusively consultants had constantly expressed increased risk for perceived stress (RRR=5.15 to 8.75, in various situations) as compared to their peers. Practice setting plays a vital role in stress. The stress and job satisfaction levels in group practice or those with multiple models of endodontic practice as compared with solo practice to consultants may vary.(Lo Sasso et al., 2015)As compared to stand alone practice endodontists, those pursuing exclusively consultation (more than 1 clinic) had 3 times elevated risk of severe PS/distress levels in both of PSS or CDPI. This probably indicates that financial implication posed by COVID19 situation is a driver of the (dis)stress. This is further highlighted by the significant difference in PSS and CDPI scores during phase-1 and after announcement of phase-2, when the financial ramification increased with extension of lock down.",
