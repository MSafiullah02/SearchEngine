The principle of group testing consists in combining samples from multiple individuals into a single pool that is then tested using a single test-kit. The pool sample is to be positive if and only if at least one individual in the group is contaminated. The idea of group testing is not new, with a long history that dates back to 1943 [11] in the context of syphilis detection (see [12] for a review). Optimal diagnostic strategies include smart-pooling, whereby pools are organised according to lines and columns on a grid -or hypercube-with overlaps enabling the identification of positive individuals [13] [14] [15] .",

Second, we provide a short description of the RT-qPCR test and propose a statistical model for its study. Then, we fit the parameters of this model by proposing a procedure to analyse the viral charge in patients as measured by RT-qPCR tests; our analysis is currently based on a simulated dataset that has similar statistical features as arXiv:2005.06776v1 [q-bio.QM] 14 May 2020 the clinical dateset of Ref. [23] ; our objective here is to provide a method to estimate the risk of false negative caused by the pooling dilution effect. Finally, we show how, using this statistical model, one can measure the viral prevalence in the population (as introduced in the first section) and design protocols to prevent an epidemic outbreak to spread within closed vulnerable communities (e.g. retirement homes, detention centres).",

We find that there exists an optimal pool size at a value N = N opt when \u00b5 0 is close to d cens , and the viral charge in patient 0 is close to being undetectable, even in small groups (top row). In this case, beyond N > N opt , the risk of false negatives in large pools overcomes the potential benefit of testing larger portion of the community. However, when such high diagnostic sensibility is not needed, the detection probability becomes a monotonic function of the pool size N , indicating that larger pools are always beneficial. Moreover, if using multiple tests has an important impact on the detection probability for small d cens \u2212\u00b5 0 , the gain is marginal as soon as the viral charge becomes large enough.",

We imagine that a community of A individuals is being monitored by being regularly tested every \u03c4 units of time, and we seek the impact of this parameter \u03c4 . Every \u03c4 units of time, k individuals are sampled at random in the population to be tested as a pool. At a random date, which we choose to be the time t = 0, the patient 0 in the population gets contaminated, and immediately start infecting members of its community at rate \u03bb. Each newly infected individual then contributes to spreading the disease at the same rate \u03bb. At the onset of contagiosity, the viral charge of the patient 0 within the community is quantified in terms of a lognormal random variable logN(\u00b50, \u03c30) (describing the number of amplification cycles needed to detect the viral charge in a RT-qPCR machine) that is either (top) large with \u00b50 = 37 modelling a patient 0 with a very low viral concentration (bottom) moderate \u00b50 = 30 modelling a patient 0 with a moderate viral concentration; in both cases \u03c30 = 2. In this model, the number of infected individuals at date t, denoted by N (t), is distributed according to a geometric random variable with parameter 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03bbt , as expected for such Yule process [27] . In the absence of screening tests, the average detection time is T s , the time at which first symptoms appear, with T s = \u03c6 \u2212 log(1 \u2212 r)/\u03bb. The average number of contaminated individuals at that time then reads: N (T s ) = e \u03bb\u03c6 /(1 \u2212 r). In comparison, based on Eq. (10), we find that the first screening test after contamination will detect the outbreak with a probability",

In Fig. 5 , we compare different screening scenarios for a large community composed of A = 1000 individuals (e.g. company).
