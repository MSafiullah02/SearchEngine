            "text": "\nAntheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (AmCPV) is one of the most widespread pathogens of Indian non-mulberry silkworm, A. mylitta. Almost 20% crop is damaged annually due to this virus attack (Jolly et al., 1974). A large number of CPV-infected A. myllita larvae develop chronic diarrhea that eventually leads to a condition known as \u201cGrasserie\u201d and the death of the larvae (Jolly et al., 1974). CPV belongs to the genus Cypovirus and family Reoviridae (Mertens et al., 2005, Payne and Mertens, 1983). CPV infects the midgut of the wide range of insects belonging to the order Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera (Bellonick and Mori, 1998). Viral infection is often characterized by the production of large number of occlusion body called polyhedra in the cytoplasm of infected cells. CPV genome is composed of 10 double stranded RNA segments (S1\u2013S10) (Payne and Mertens, 1983), although a small 11 segment (S11) has been reported in some cases such as Trichoplusia ni cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (TnCPV-15) (Rao et al., 2000) and Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) (Arella et al., 1988). Each dsRNA segment is composed of a plus strand mRNA and its complementary minus strand in an end to end base pair configuration except for a protruding 5\u2032 cap on the plus strand. Among the viruses of the family Reoviridae, complete nucleotide sequences of double stranded RNA genome have been reported for the members of the genera Orthoreovirus, Rotavirus, Orbivirus, Phytoreovirus, Coltivirus, Oryzavirus, Seadornavirus, cypovirus and putative members of Fijivirus (Attoui et al., 2005a, Attoui et al., 2005b, Cowled et al., 2009, Duncan, 1999, Estes and Cohen, 1989, Graham et al., 2008, Hagiwara et al., 2001, Hagiwara et al., 2002, Mertens et al., 2005, Nakashima et al., 1996, Rao et al., 2000, Suzuki, 1995).",

We have also reported that the genome segments 6, 7, 8, and 10 of AmCPV encodes viral structural proteins p68 (having ATP binding and ATPase activity), p61, p60 and polyhedrin, respectively, while segment 9 encodes a nonstructural protein, NSP38, having RNA binding property (Chavali and Ghosh, 2007, Chavali et al., 2008, Jangam et al., 2006, Qanungo et al., 2002, Sinha-Datta et al., 2005). Segment 11 of AmCPV does not contain any ORF (Jangam et al., 2006) and its function remains unclear. Other genome segments of this virus (S1\u2013S5) have not been cloned, sequenced and characterized at molecular level. Here, we report molecular cloning, sequencing and expression of AmCPV S2 and show by functional analysis that it encodes viral RdRp which catalyzes RNA synthesis without the help of any other viral protein.",

            "text": "AmCPV S2 RNA was isolated, converted to cDNA and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO and the total nucleotide sequence was determined in both forward and reverse directions. Sequencing of AmCPV S2 showed that it consisted of 3798 nucleotides with a single long ORF of 3351 nucleotides, which could encode a protein of 1116 amino acids. The ORF in the cDNA started with an ATG codon at nucleotide 30 and terminates in a TGA codon at nucleotide 3380. Twenty-nine nucleotides upstream of the start codon and four hundred and eighteen nucleotides downstream of stop codon were present as untranslated sequences. The molecular mass of the encoded protein was deduced as \u223c 123 kDa. BLAST analysis showed that nucleotide sequence of AmCPV S2 was 29% identical with RdRp of CoCPV, LdCPV and BmCPV encoded by their genome segment 2 and allows to conclude that AmCPV S2 could also encode viral RdRp. This is supported by the MotifScan result which showed the presence of characteristic signature motifs for the RdRp of members of the Reoviridae: the conserved GDD motif at positions 681\u2013683 and GKQXGXXXD motif at positions 526\u2013534 (Li et al., 2007). In addition, comparison of the sequences of AmCPV S2 encoded RdRp with those of poliovirus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), reovirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) showed the presence of catalytic motif A (with conserved aspartates separated by four residues), motif B (with conserved \u201cXSG\u201d sequence), motif C (with conserved \u2018XDD\u201d sequence), motif D (with conserved hydrophilic E and K residue) in the palm sub domain, as well as motif F (with submotifs, F1, F2 and F3 containing conserved positively charged, basic residues K or R) in the finger sub domain (Fig. 1\n). It also contained motif E (with hydrophobic residues) positioned between the palm and thumb subdomains and motif G (with conserved \u201cSXG\u201d sequences) to form loop and alpha\u2013helix structure (Candress et al., 1990, Poch et al., 1989, Xu et al., 2003, O'Reilly and Kao, 1998).",

Analysis of sonicated bacterial pellet (in PBS) and supernatant by SDS-PAGE showed expression of AmCPV S2 encoded protein in E. coli as insoluble form (data not shown) and may be due to improper folding of expressed protein in bacteria. Bacteria were then lysed in buffer containing 8 M urea to solubilize expressed insoluble protein, and purified through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Analysis of this protein by SDS-8% PAGE (Fig. 3A) showed a 123 kDa protein band. Polyclonal antibody was raised in a rabbit against this purified protein, affinity purified and the final concentration was determined as 1.5 mg/ml. The titer of purified antibody was determined by ELISA as 10,000 using 2.5 \u00b5g of antigen, and used for immunoblot analysis. Since E. coli produced this protein as insoluble inclusion bodies, wild type recombinant and mutant AmCPV S2 encoded proteins were expressed in soluble form as His-tagged fusion protein in Sf 9 cells via baculovirus expression system and purified through Ni-NTA chromatography. The production of wild type recombinant and mutant (GDD-GAD and GDD-GAA) proteins as 123 kDa band was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using raised polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3B). This indicates that due to proper folding of expressed protein inside the insect cells, soluble protein have been produced and to our knowledge this is the first report of the production of any cypoviral RdRp in soluble form.",

Also the activity was not inhibited by Actinomycin D (50 \u00b5g/ml), a compound which forms complex with DNA and interferes with RNA synthesis indicating that the measured activity is not caused by contaminating DNA dependent DNA polymerase activity present in insect cell extract.",

As shown in Fig. 4A, RdRp activity increased with increasing concentrations of protein up to 0.4 \u00b5M and then attained a plateau. In another separate experiment, in vitro synthesized AmCPV S2 3' positive strand RNA was used as template in the assay and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The data (band intensities of 28.72, 43.89, 54.32, 50.72, 49.8 and 49 for the enzyme concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.8 \u00b5M, respectively) showed maximum RdRp activity up to 0.4 \u00b5M concentration of enzyme and then attained a plateau (Fig. 4A, inset). To correlate the RdRp activity of expressed protein with the template concentration, RNA synthesis was performed at 0.4 \u00b5M purified AmCPV RdRp with varying concentrations of homopolymeric poly (A) RNA template and oligo U (18) primer. As shown in Fig. 4B, there was a linear correlation upto the concentration of 0.20 \u00b5M template. The effect of pH, temperature and cation ion concentration on the RdRp activity of this protein was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of MgCl2 and MnCl2.\nFig. 5A, showed that although some RdRp activity was detected in presence of Mn++ but maximun RdRp activity was found in presence of Mg++, at the concentration of 3 mM. The result was almost similar with the BTV RdRp (VP1) activity where the maximum RdRp activity was observed at 4 mM Mg++ (Boyce et al., 2004). AmCPV RdRp activity was found to be optimal within pH range from 5.5 to 6.5 and reduced at pH below 5.0 and above 8.0 (Fig. 5B). The optimum pH for HCV RdRp was found to be 7.0 and in case of Norovirus the pH range was 6.8 to 7.5 (Fukushi et al., 2004, Lohmann et al., 1998). AmCPV RdRp activity was found to be higher at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 5C) as observed in case of Rotavirus RdRp which also showed maximum activity between 30 \u00b0C\u201337 \u00b0C (Tortorici et al., 2003). The optimal salt concentration for AmCPV RdRp activity was found to be 20 mM KCl and 80 mM NaCl (Fig. 5D). These results were comparable with HCV RdRp where maximum RdRp activity was found to be at 10 mM KCl and 50 mM NaCl (Lohmann et al., 1998). These data indicated that AmCPV RdRp activity is dependent on protein concentration, temperature, pH, salt concentration and divalent Mg++.",

We chose these minigenome's templates based on the assumption that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs would contain the cis acting signals necessary for the initiation of minus strand RNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 6B, 32P labeled RNA products with a size similar to that of RNA substrate were obtained in reactions containing 3\u2032 positive and 3\u2032 negative strand RNA transcripts as template (lanes 1 and 3) but not in the reaction containing 5\u2032 positive strand RNA fragment as template when no primer was used (lane 2). These results indicate that AmCPV RdRp can synthesize RNA de novo utilizing AmCPV S2 subgenomic RNA as template like those of other RNA viruses (Casey et al., 1986, Zhong et al., 1998) and without the help of any other viral proteins as observed in BTV VP1 protein (Boyce et al., 2004). The preference of 3' positive and 3' negative strand may depend on the specific recognition of RdRp of the special structure of RNA substrate for the initiation of RNA synthesis in a primer dependent manner. The importance of the 3' untranslated region of RNA in the initiation of replication process has been demonstrated in several viruses including bamboo mosaic virus (Li et al., 1998), turnip crinkle virus (Rajendran et al., 2002), picorna virus (Kok and McMinn, 2009) and rotavirus (Chen et al., 2001).",

No products were observed in the absence of enzyme (lane 5) or RNA template (lane 4) or when double stranded RNA (AmCPV S11) was used as template (lane 7). Failing to synthesize RNA in vitro from dsRNA template suggests the involvement of other viral proteins that may help unwinding the dsRNA template prior to transcription. In bluetongue virus, VP6 has been shown to possess nucleotide triphosphatase, RNA binding and helicase activities and to act early as part of transcriptase complex during replication (Matsuo and Roy, 2009). As shown in Fig. 6C, RNA products synthesized in vitro during RdRp reaction were sensitive to RNase A digestion under both high and low salt conditions (lane 2 and 3) indicating that the generated RNA products were single stranded in nature. The degradation of the synthesized RNA products after RNase treatment under both high and low salt conditions suggests the synthesis of single stranded and not the double stranded RNA product in vitro by AmCPV RdRp. It also eliminates the possibility of the synthesis double template size RNA products by copy back mechanism as observed in bovine viral diarrhea virus (Zhong et al., 1998). Time course of RdRp reaction was then carried out using in vitro transcribed 3\u2032 positive strand RNA as template under the same condition. It was observed that RNA products transcribed by AmCPV RdRp are in linear proportion to the incubation time during the first 120 min and then come to a saturation state (data not shown).",

To rule out this possibility we performed TNTase assays in the presence of all four NTPs and \u03b132P or [\u03b132P] UTP and cold UTP (10 \u03bcM) or in the presence of only [\u03b132P] UTP as a sole ribonucleotide substrate.
