To investigate the mechanisms of such inflammatory diseases, potential chemokine gene activation in human astrocytes was investigated following infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), or coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4). We report that all these viruses are potent inducers for the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) genes in primary human astrocytes, as well as in an established astrocyte cell line (U-373MG). Further studies indicated that both activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-B transcription factors are required in the activation of chemokine genes in human astrocytes infected with various picornaviruses. Interestingly, the pattern of activated chemokine genes in human astrocytes is quite restricted compared to that in mouse astrocytes infected with the same viruses, suggesting species differences in gene activation. This may result in potential differences in the pathogenic outcome in each species.",

Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and B4 (CVB4) infections in mice have also been used to study myocarditis and pancreatitis, as these viruses are known to cause these diseases in humans as well as in mice (Ramsingh et al., 1997; Modlin et al., 1999) . In addition, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) belonging to the cardiovirus genus of the picornavirus family causes acute encephalitis and/or chronic demyelinating disease in experimental mice; thus, this system has been used as a relevant model for virus-induced demyelinating disease . Many of the previous studies have been focused on immune components involved in myocarditis and pancreatitis for CVB and demyelination for TMEV. However, numerous recent studies recognized the importance of innate immune responses to viral infections subsequently influencing the development of specific adaptive immune responses to the infectious agents (Liew and McInnes, 2002; Reiss et al., 2002) . Despite the importance of innate immune responses, virtually nothing is known about the initial responses to CVB or other picornaviruses by human glial cells. Such studies may be valuable in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of encephalitis and demyelination induced by these viruses.",

            "text": "Chemokines are important mediators of the inflammatory response to many stimuli, including viral infections. Chemokines appear to have multiple biological functions in inflammatory responses, such as chemoattraction of a variety of cells, activation of certain cell populations, angiogenesis of endothelial cells and blood-brain barrier dysfunction (Kossmann et al., 1997; Kunkel and Butcher, 2002) . In viral meningitis, interleukin-8 (IL-8), IFNgamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) appear to be responsible for the chemoattraction of neutrophils, peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PB-MCs) , and activated T cells (Lahrtz et al., 1998) . Similarly, significant elevation of MCP-1 and IL-8 is demonstrated in patients with demyelinating diseases (Van Der Voorn et al., 1999; Polyak et al., 2001) . The production of cytokines and chemokines has also been shown in the CNS of mice following a variety of viral infections, including TMEV (Asensio and Campbell, 1997; Lane et al., 1998; Hoffman et al., 1999; Noe et al., 1999; Lane et al., 2000; Theil et al., 2000) . Various chemokines were found in the CNS during the onset and late stages of TMEV-induced disease (Hoffman et al., 1999; Theil et al., 2000) . More recently, we have shown that TMEV infection primarily upregulates regulated upon activation in normal T-cells, expressed, and secreted (RANTES) and IP-10 gene expression in primary murine astrocyte cultures and broader chemokine genes in oligodendrocyte and microglia cultures as early as 30 min after viral infection . These virus-induced chemokines overlap with those that are inducible by proinflammatory cytokines in human and mouse astrocytes (Wesselingh et al., 1990; Shrikant et al., 1995; Shrikant and Benveniste, 1996) , suggesting that glial cells, astrocytes in particular, may be critical for early recruitment of inflammatory cells in the initiation of virus-induced, immunemediated demyelination. However, very little is known about this chemokine gene expression in human astrocytes following infection with CVB, which is a potentially important mechanism involved in the initiation of inflammatory disease in target tissues, including the CNS.",

We demonstrate that all these viruses induce IL-8 and MCP-1 selectively in primary human astrocyte cultures and a human astrocytoma line. Activation of both activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-B transcription factors appears to be necessary for the chemokine gene activation, suggesting that both factors are involved in the activation of chemokine genes in human astrocytes infected with various picornaviruses.

In addition, the chemokine gene activation patterns were compared to that induced by TMEV, which is known to induce various chemokine genes in primary murine astrocytes . The chemokine mRNAs expressed following infection with these viruses were identical with respect to the chemokines and kinetics. As early as 1-2 h after viral infection, the chemokine mRNAs were detectable and levels increased at 4 -8 h. In addition, the chemokine genes activated by these viruses were very selective; only MCP-1 and IL-8 mRNAs of seven different chemokine mRNAs tested were significantly induced. Although the levels of chemokine gene activation were relatively low in the primary human astrocyte cultures, the pattern was virtually identical to that seen with the U-373 astrocyte cell line (Fig. 1B) . The lower level of chemokine gene activation in the primary cultures may reflect lower infectivity and/or cell numbers used due to limited supply.",

The results clearly indicate that the selective chemokine gene activation following infection with virus results in the production of the chemokine proteins. Thus, these chemokines induced upon viral infection are likely to affect the type and level of inflammatory responses by influencing the infiltration of select cell types. To determine further whether such chemokine gene activation requires viral replication, the chemokine levels in similar cultures exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated virus were compared to those of intact virus (Fig. 2) .

Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the molecules indicated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated as early as 0.5-1 h and persisted for 4 -8 h after viral infection (Fig. 3A) . The levels of total ERK-1/2 were similar throughout the time periods indicating that the increases in the phosphoproteins were not due to the differences in the concentrations of proteins loaded to the gel. Similarly, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was also detectable 1 h after viral infection (Fig. 3B) . Therefore, infection of human astrocytes with picornavirus results in activation of the MAPK involved in inflammatory responses. To correlate the activation of MAPK with chemokine production, activation of a potential downstream transcription factor, AP-1 was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), using the consensus AP-1-specific oligonucleotides (Fig.  3C ). Our results clearly indicate that the AP-1 transcription factor is also activated soon after viral infection. AP-1 accumulation showed a peak at 0.5-1 h and was reduced significantly at 2 h and thereafter. The AP-1 binding assay was specific for the nucleotide sequence, as an excess amount of the unlabeled oligonucleotides successfully blocked the binding of nuclear extracts to the labeled nucleotide probe. These results strongly suggest that picornaviral infection leads to the activation of MAPK as well as AP-1 that is potentially associated with chemokine production.",

Therefore, the possibility of NF-B activation in the astrocytoma cells following viral infection was next examined (Fig. 5) . First, the levels of total IB-\u2423 and phosphorylated form of IB-\u2423 were assessed during viral infection in astrocytes by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A) . The results indicated that IB-\u2423 is rapidly phosphorylated (\u03fe2fold) as early as 15 min upon viral infection, as compared to uninfected control cultures, and sustained for at least 8 h. In addition, the overall IB level was increased significantly 15 min after viral infection, declined rapidly at 30 min, and remained low thereafter. These results strongly suggest that IB is rapidly phosphorylated and subsequently degraded upon viral infection, leading to NF-B activation. To assess directly the activation of NF-B, accumulation of NF-B molecules in the nuclei of virus-infected astrocytoma cells was assessed by EMSA, using NF-B-specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 5B) . The results indicate that nuclear translocation of NF-B starts at 15 min, peaks at 30 Fig. 3 .

Activation of MAP kinases was assessed by determining the level of phosphorylation with Western blotting using antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of kinases. Phospho-ERK and phospho JNK(A) and phospho-p38 (B) were determined. Either total ERK or actin was assessed using specific antibodies as internal controls for protein concentrations loaded.

The binding was completely abrogated to background levels in the presence of excess amount of unlabeled NF-B-specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 5C ).

The levels of chemokines secreted by the virus-infected cells in the presence of the inhibitor corresponded with transcription levels. Because these chemical inhibitors may also inhibit the activation of NF-B without involving IB, the effect of a dominant negative form of IB, a replication-deficient adenovirus expressing IB substituted at two phosphorylation sites required for NF-B activation, was also examined (Fig. 6C) . Chemokine gene expression in astrocytes infected with the adenovirus-IB super-suppressor prior to picornavirus infection was compared to that infected with control GFP-adenovirus. Astrocytes preinfected with the IB super repressor, but not control GFP-adenovirus, completely inhibited IL-8 and MCP-1 gene expression inducible by TMEV.

NF-B activation was apparently independent of ERK-1/2 activation (Fig. 7A) , since the presence of inhibitor of upstream MEK, U0126, did not affect the activation of NF-B induced by viral infection. Simi-larly, the presence of NF-B inhibitor, PDTC, did not affect the activation of ERK-1/2 (Fig. 7B) , which appears to be necessary for induction of chemokine gene expression by viral infection (Fig. 4) . Inhibition of ERK-1/2 activation with pretreatment with U0126, but not control U0124, significantly reduced the nuclear translocation of AP-1, suggesting that an ERK-1/2 pathway is required for AP-1 activation (Fig. 7C) .

Furthermore, IL-8 is known to enhance the cytopathic effect of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of picornavirus on a human cell line (Khabar et al., 1997b) . This chemokine appears to play a major negative role in the early defense against viruses by inhibiting interferon-\u2423 (IFN-\u2423) activity resulting in increases in viral RNA synthesis and persistence (Khabar et al., 1997a) . In contrast, MCP-1 is a member of the CC family of chemokine, directing neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage infiltration to the site of infection. These chemokines have also been found in various inflammatory responses and at the sites of inflammatory diseases, including demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis (Van Der Voorn et al., 1999; Polyak et al., 2001) . Therefore, these chemokines, in particular, are most likely to play profound roles in the initiation and expansion of inflammatory responses to various picornaviruses in the target tissues of viral infection, including the CNS.",

            "text": "The signal pathways responsible for the highly selective chemokine gene activation in human astrocytes infected with these picornaviruses have also been assessed in the present study. We primarily used TMEV as a representative picornavirus for these studies since identical patterns of chemokine gene activation are observed upon infection with TMEV, CVB3, or CVB4 in both human (Fig. 1) and murine astrocytes (Fig. 8) , suggesting that common mechanisms are involved in chemokine gene activation by these viruses, and perhaps by picornavirus in general. Interestingly, activation of both MAPK and NF-B appears to be necessary for the chemokine gene activation after viral infection (Figs. 4 and 6) . In particular, U0126, a specific inhibitor for ERK activation, exerted a powerful suppression of both IL-8 and MCP-1 gene expression. Recently, it has been shown that IL-8 production is linked to activation of ERK-1/2 by other viruses Alcorn et al., 2001) . In addition, HIV-1 Tat protein is capable of inducing primarily IP-10, MCP-1, and IL-8 chemokine gene expression in a human astrocyte line (CRT-MG), and the expression of both MCP-1 and IL-8, but not IP-10, is inhibited by U0126 (Kutsch et al., 2000) . However, it remains unclear how the ERK-1/2 activation pathway is associated with chemokine gene expression. Previously, it has been established that MEKK1 (ERK kinase kinase-1) induces activation of both IKK-\u2423 and IKK-\u2424 leading to NF-B activation. (Lee et al., 1997 (Lee et al., , 1998 . Thus, ERK activation may be necessary for NF-B activation following infection with picornavirus. However, our results show that activation of ERK induced after viral infection is independent from activation of NF-B (Fig. 7) . In addition, it appears that the downstream target of ERK is AP-1 for chemokine gene expression in human astrocytes (Fig.  7C ), similar to human microglia following stimulation with IFN-\u2424 (Kim et al., 2002) . Recently, activation of p38 and JNK was shown in fibroblast cells following infection with EMCV (Iordanov et al., 2000) . Since p38 MAP kinase is involved for NF-B-dependent gene expression by regulating the DNA binding of TATA-binding protein to the TATA box (Carter et al., 1999) , this MAPK may also play a role in this pathway. Viral replication appears to be required for activation of chemokine gene expression, as UV-inactivated virus failed to activate chemokine production in human astrocytes (Fig. 2) . This is consistent with our earlier reports that chemokine gene activation is abrogated by UV-inactivation of virus and that only mouse astrocytes producing viral RNA produce cytokines after TMEV infection (Palma et. al., 2003) . These results strongly suggest that viral infection and replication are required for cellular gene activation by picornavirus. Interestingly, our preliminary study suggests that overlapping but different signaling pathways are required for viral replication and chemokine gene activation in human astrocytes. For example, Fig. 8 . Differences in chemokine gene induction in the primary mouse astrocytes by the picornaviruses. Mouse primary astrocyte cultures derived from neonatal brains were infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), or coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) and the chemokines genes activated by these viruses for 8 h were compared by RPA. NFB and p38 inhibitors, but not ERK inhibitor, suppressed viral message production, which is different from chemokine gene activation. We do not know why MAPK remain activated up to 8 h in contrast to AP-1, which decreases after 2 h. Similarly, we do not know why phospho-IB remains high, and yet overall IB levels recover. Obviously, additional studies are required to unravel the complex signaling relationship between viral replication and activation of chemokine genes, as well as other cellular survival genes.",

In addition, IL-8 gene expression induced by cytomegalovirus (CMV) involves concurrent binding of AP-1 and NF-B to the promoter sites of the IL-8 gene (Murayama et al., 1997) , suggesting that the combination of these transcription factors is a powerful inducer for selective chemokine gene expression (Ondrey et al., 1999) . Similarly, induction of MCP-1 by IL-1\u2424 in human endothelial cells depends on the cooperation between AP-1 and NF-B (Martin et al., 1997) . However, it is also conceivable that undefined additional regulatory elements in the IL-8 and MCP-1 genes may be involved in the expression of these chemokine genes, as described for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) response element in the IL-8 promoter region (Casola et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, it is very likely that chemokine genes responsive to a combination of AP-1 and NF-B transcription factors are preferentially activated in human astrocytes by certain viral infections, including picornaviruses. This preferential activation of select chemokine gene expression may function as a mechanism favoring viral host evasion by lowering antiviral IFN function and promoting cellular infiltration, ultimately supporting viral expansion and inflammation.",

Species differences in the chemokine gene activation may represent differences in the requirements for chemokine gene activation. For example, the RANTES gene does not contain an AP-1 binding site and yet is activated predominantly in mouse astrocytes infected with these viruses. Thus, NF-B transcription factor alone appears to be sufficient for mouse chemokine/cytokine gene activation, perhaps leading to broader gene expression (Palma et al., 2003) . The significance of this difference in chemokine gene activation between human and mouse astrocytes is unclear. However, the difference in the chemokine gene activation pattern is species specific and not dependent on the viruses in the picornarvirus family, as demonstrated using different picornaviruses in the present study ( Figs. 1 and 8) . The differences in chemokine gene expression are not likely to reflect a difference in the level of infection between human and mouse astrocytes, since a similar infectivity (20 -30%), as well as unaltered patterns by varying viral dose, are observed in these cell types. Thus, an identical virus may be able to manifest a different disease in different species. The type of initial chemokines produced alone may not be sufficient to direct the outcome of inflammatory diseases since these viruses induce different diseases in the same species. Perhaps, combinations of the level and site of viral persistence and the type of infiltrating cells may shape the adaptive immune response leading to either the protection or further development of specific inflammatory diseases.",
