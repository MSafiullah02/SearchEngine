Requirements of medical conduct were spelled out as part of the general legal code of Hammurabi in Mesopotamia (c.\n 1700 BCE). This code included regulation of physician fees, with punishment for treatment failure, which set a legal basis for the subsequent secular practice of medicine. Many of the main traditions of medicine were based on magic or derived from religion. Medical practice was often based on belief in the supernatural, and healers were believed to have a religious calling. Training of medical practitioners, regulation of their practice, and ethical standards evolved in a number of ancient societies. In general, physicians were regulated by specific schools that acted as trade guilds, often with many competing schools based on differing gods, methods, and mystical beliefs.",

The ancient Indian way of medical practice, Ayurveda, is the Sanskrit translation of \u201cknowledge of life\u201d. Primarily originating in the Indus Valley, the golden age of ancient Indian medicine began approximately 800 BCE. Personal hygiene, sanitation, and water supply engineering were emphasized in the laws of Manu. Pioneering physicians, supported by Buddhist kings, developed the use of drugs and surgery, and established schools of medicine and public hospitals as part of state medicine. Indian medicine played a leading role throughout Asia between 800 BCE and 400 CE, when major texts on medicine and surgery were written. Among the most valued pieces of ancient Indian writings are those created by Sushruta, a surgeon, and Charaka, a physician, both prominent teachers who ran prestigious schools of medicine. These writings contribute to validating ancient India\u2019s medical history. According to some historians, the teachings of Sushruta and Charaka were passed along to the Romans and Greeks. Despite these advanced medical teachings, with the Mogul invasion of 600 CE, state support declined, and with it, Indian medicine.",

It also laid a basis for medical and public health jurisprudence. Personal and community responsibility for health included a mandatory day of rest, limits on slavery and guarantees of the rights of slaves and workers, protection of water supplies, sanitation of communities and camps, waste disposal, and food protection, all codified in detailed religious obligations. Food regulation prevented use of diseased or unclean animals, and prescribed methods of slaughter improved the possibility of preservation of the meat. While there was an element of viewing illness as a punishment for sin, there was also an ethical and social stress on the value of human life with an obligation to seek and provide care. The Talmudic interpretation of biblical law is the concept of sanctity of human life (Pikuah Nefesh); the saving of a single human life was considered \u201cas if one saved the whole world\u201d, which has been given overriding religious and social roles in community life. A second principle from this source is improving the quality of life on Earth (Tikkun Olam). In this tradition, there is an ethical imperative to achieve a better earthly life for all. The Mosaic Law, which forms the basis for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, codified health behaviors for the individual and for society. These found secular versions in Humanism over recent centuries, which have continued into the modern era as basic concepts in societal values and in practical application in environmental and social hygiene.",

Ancient Greece placed high emphasis on healthful living habits in terms of personal hygiene, nutrition, physical fitness, and community sanitation. Hippocrates articulated the clinical methods of observation and documentation and a code of ethics of medical practice. He articulated the relationship between disease patterns and the natural environment (air, water, and places), which dominated epidemiological thinking until the nineteenth century. Preservation of health was seen as a balance of forces: exercise and rest, nutrition and excretion, and recognizing the importance of age and sex variables in health needs. Disease was seen as having inevitable natural causation, and medical care was valued, with the city-states providing free medical services for the poor and for slaves. City officials were appointed to look after public drains and water supply, providing organized sanitary and public health services. Hippocrates gave medicine a rudimentary, scientific, and ethical spirit which lasts to the present time.\n",

Roman law also regulated businesses and medical practice. The influence of the Roman Empire resulted in the transfer of these ideas throughout much of Europe and the Middle East. Rome itself had access to clean water via 10 aqueducts supplying ample water for the citizens. Rome also built public drains. By the early first century BCE, the aqueducts made available 600\u2013900 liters per person per day of household water from mountains. Marshlands were drained to reduce endemic malaria. Public baths were built to serve the poor, and fountains were built in private homes for the wealthy. Streets were paved, and organized garbage disposal served the cities.",

Roman medicine, based on mystical beliefs and religious rites, with slaves as physicians, developed partly from Greek physicians who brought their skills and knowledge to Rome after the destruction of Corinth in 146 BCE. Training as apprentices, Roman physicians achieved a highly respected role in society. Hospitals and municipal doctors were employed by Roman cities to provide free care to the poor and the slaves, but physicians also engaged in private practice, mostly on retainers to families. Occupational health was described with measures to reduce known risks such as lead exposure, particularly in mining. Commercial weights and measures were standardized and supervised. Rome made important contributions to the public health tradition of sanitation, urban planning, and organized medical care. Galen, Rome\u2019s leading physician, perpetuated the fame of Hippocrates through his medical writings, basing medical assessment on the four humors (sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic).

The Black Death was also introduced to China with Mongol invasions, bringing tremendous mortality, halving the population of China between 1200 and 1400 CE. Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, during the Mongol\u2013Tatar conquests, many widespread epidemics, including plague, were recorded in Rus (now Russia). The plagues traveled rapidly with armies and caravan traders, and later by ship as world trade expanded in the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries (Box 1.1\n). The plague ravaged most of Europe between 1346 and 1350, killing between 24 and 50 million people, approximately one-third of the population, and leaving vast areas of Europe sparsely populated. Despite local efforts to prevent disease by quarantine and isolation of the sick, the disease devastated whole communities.BOX 1.1\u201cThis is the End of the World\u201d: The Black Death\n\"Rumors of a terrible plague supposedly arising in China and spreading through Tartary (Central Asia) to India and Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt and all of Asia Minor had reached Europe in 1346. They told of a death toll so devastating that all of India was said to be depopulated, whole territories covered by dead bodies, other areas with no one left alive. As added up by Pope Clement VI at Avignon, the total of reported dead reached 23,840,000. In the absence of a concept of contagion, no serious alarm was felt in Europe until the trading ships brought their black burden of pestilence into Messina while other infected ships from the Levant carried it to Genoa and Venice. By January 1348 it penetrated France via Marseille, and North Africa via Tunis. Ship-borne along coasts and navigable rivers, it spread westward from Marseille through the ports of Languedoc to Spain and northward up the Rhone to Avignon, where it arrived in March. It reached Narbonne, Montpellier, Carcassone, and Toulouse between February and May, and at the same time in Italy spread to Rome and Florence and their hinterlands. Between June and August it reached Bordeaux, Lyon, and Paris, spread to Burgundy and Normandy into southern England. From Italy during the summer it crossed the Alps into Switzerland and reached eastward to Hungary. In a given area the plague accomplished its kill within four to six months and then faded, except in the larger cities, where, rooting into the close-quartered population, it abated during the winter, only to appear in spring and rage for another six months.\"\nSource: Tuchman BW.

It was the tragedy of Admiral Anson\u2019s expedition of circumnavigation, with the deaths of 380 men out of a crew of 510 on one of his ships, which led to Lind\u2019s interest in investigating scurvy.In May 1747, on HMS Salisbury, Lind conducted his study by treating 12 sailors who had fallen sick to scurvy. He gave each sailor one of six different dietary regimens. The two sailors who were fed oranges and lemons recovered from their illness and were fit for duty within 6 days. This is in contrast to all of the other sailors, who were given different treatments, and consequently, remained sick. Lind concluded that citrus fruits would treat and prevent scurvy. In 1753, he published A treatise of the scurvy: in three parts. Containing an inquiry into the nature, causes and cure of that disease together with a critical and chronological view of what has been published on the subject.Lind reported: \u201cScurvy began to rage after being a month or six weeks at sea \u2026 the water on board \u2026 was uncommonly sweet and good [and] provisions such as could afford no suspicion \u2026 yet, at the expiration of ten weeks, we brought into Plymouth 80 men, out of a complement of 350, more or less afflicted with the diseases\". Captain Lind observed during his experiment that: \u201cthe most sudden and visible good effects were perceived from the use of oranges and lemons\u201d, and that in a short time this group was fit for duty, whereas all the other groups remained ill. He concluded that: \u201cexperience indeed sufficiently shows that as green or fresh vegetables with ripe fruit were the best remedies for it [i.e., scurvy], so they prove the most effectual preservatives against it\u201d, and that oranges are \u201cthe most effectual preservatives against the distemper\".Scurvy was eliminated in the Royal Navy by the end of the eighteenth century, but continued to plague merchant seaman during most of the nineteenth century until compulsory lime juice was imposed and steam ships led to shortened voyage times.Sources: Carpenter KJ.

This revolutionary experiment culminated in the eventual eradication of this dreaded killing and disfiguring disease some 200 years later. In 1800, vaccination was adopted by the British armed forces, and the practice spread to Europe, the Americas, and the British Empire. Denmark made vaccination mandatory in the early nineteenth century and soon eradicated smallpox locally. Despite some professional opposition, the practice spread rapidly from the upper classes and voluntary groups to the common people as a result of the fear of becoming infected with smallpox. Vaccination later became compulsory in many countries, leading to the ultimate public health achievement: global eradication of smallpox in the late twentieth century.BOX 1.4Jenner and SmallpoxVariolation, or the exposure of people to the pustular matter of cases of smallpox, was originally documented in ancient China in 320 CE. This practice was used widely in the eighteenth century as a lucrative medical practice, and was a powerful tool in protecting armies from the ravages of smallpox. Variolation was made mandatory by George Washington in the Continental Army during the American Revolution.In 1796, Edward Jenner (1749\u20131823), a country physician in Gloucestershire, England, investigated local folklore that milkmaids were immune to smallpox because of their exposure to cowpox. He took matter from a cowpox pustule on a milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, and applied it with scratches to the skin of a young boy named James Phipps. This inoculated the boy with smallpox, and in turn, he did not develop the disease. Jenner\u2019s 1798 publication, An enquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinia, described his widescale vaccination and its successful protection against smallpox. Jenner prophesied that \u201cthe annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the result of this practice\". He then developed vaccination as a method to replace variolation.Opposition to vaccination was intense, and Jenner\u2019s contribution was ignored by the scientific and medical establishment of the day, but he was later rewarded by Parliament. Vaccination was adopted as a universal practice by the British military in 1800 and by Denmark in 1803. A critical public health tool, vaccination became an increasingly widespread practice during the nineteenth century. In 1977, the last case of smallpox was identified; thus, smallpox eradication was declared by the World Health Organization in 1980.Remaining stocks of the virus in the USA and Russia were to be destroyed in 1999. However, this was delayed, and following the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, the threat of bioterrorism was taken seriously, including the possibility of use of smallpox. Consequently, vaccination was reinstated for \u201cfirst responders\u201d including fire, police, and hospital staff in the USA and other countries.Sources: Riedel S.

He traced some 500 cholera deaths occurring in a 10-day period. Cases either lived close to or used the Broad Street pump for drinking water. He determined that brewery workers and poorhouse residents in the area, using uncontaminated wells, escaped the epidemic. Snow concluded that the Broad Street pump was probably contaminated.

He investigated an outbreak in 1853 in Cowbridge, a small Welsh village, where a ball attracted 140 participants from surrounding counties. Almost immediately afterwards, many of those attending the ball became sick with typhoid fever. He found that a person with typhoid had been at the location some days before, and that his excreta had been disposed of near a well, from which water was drawn for the ball. Budd then concluded that water was the vehicle of transmission of the disease. He investigated other outbreaks and summarized his reports in Typhoid Fever: Its Nature, Mode of Transmission and Prevention, published in 1873, which is a classic work on waterborne transmission of enteric disease.

            "text": "Major contributions to resolving this issue came from the epidemiological studies of Snow and Budd in the 1850s, proving waterborne transmission of cholera and typhoid, suggesting that if the disease was not from a miasma source then it was due to germ (contagion) sources. The classic study of a measles epidemic in the remote Faroe Islands by Peter Panum in 1846 clearly showed person-to-person transmission of this disease, its incubation period, and the lifelong natural immunity that exposure gives (Box 1.6\n). The dispute continued, with miasmists or sanitationists and germ theorists arguing with equal vehemence.BOX 1.6Panum on Measles in the Faroe Islands, 1846Peter Ludwig Panum (1820\u20131885), a 26-year-old newly graduated medical doctor from the University of Copenhagen, was sent to the Faroe Islands by the Danish government in 1846 to investigate an outbreak of measles. On the islands, located in the far reaches of the North Atlantic, there was no documentation of measles since 1781. During the 1846 epidemic, approximately 6000 of the 7782 islanders were stricken with measles and 102 of them died of the disease or its sequelae. Panum visited all isolated corners of the islands, tracing the chain of transmission of the disease from location to location, and the immunity of those exposed during the epidemic.From his well-documented observations he concluded, contrary to the prevailing opinion, that measles is a contagious disease spread from person to person, and that one attack gives lifelong immunity. His superb report clearly demonstrated the contagious nature of the disease and its incubation period. It also proved that measles is not a disease of \u201cspontaneous generation\u201d, nor is it generally dispersed in the atmosphere and spread as a \u201cmiasma\u201d, giving strength to and providing evidence for the germ theory.Since the 1960s, the availability of an inexpensive, highly effective, and safe vaccine has led to the elimination of domestic circulation of the virus in many countries, yet measles remains a serious global health problem in 2013. An estimated 250,000 children died of this highly contagious disease in 2006.A European-wide measles epidemic in 2010\u20132012 had over 50,000 cases in 2011 alone. As a result of imported cases and local spread, outbreaks of measles are occurring in countries that were thought to be measles free, including countries in North and South America. Measles elimination is possible with the two-dose policy with current vaccines, if immunization is given high priority with catch-up campaigns for vulnerable age groups and travelers, and pursued with determined national and international efforts.Sources: Emerson H.

In the 1850s, prevention of blindness in newborns by prophylactic use of silver nitrate eyedrops, developed by Carl Crede (1819\u20131892) in Leipzig, spread rapidly through the medical world (Box 1.7\n). This practice continues to be a standard in the prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum.BOX 1.7Crede and Prevention of Gonococcal Ophthalmia NeonatorumGonorrhea was common in all levels of society in nineteenth century Europe. Ophthalmic infection of newborns was a widespread cause of infection, scarring, and blindness. Carl Franz Crede (1819\u20131892), professor of obstetrics at the University of Leipzig, attempted to treat neonatal gonococcal ophthalmic infection with many medications. Crede discovered the use of silver nitrate as a treatment and introduced its use as a preventive measure during the period 1854\u20131860, with astonishing success.The prophylactic use of silver nitrate spread rapidly hospital by hospital. However, owing to widespread medical opposition to this innovation, decades passed before it was mandated widely. It was only in 1879 that the gonococcus organism was discovered by Albert Ludwig Neisser (1855\u20131916).

One of his many groundbreaking achievements involves the science of immunology, through his work with vaccines (Box 1.8\n).BOX 1.8Louis Pasteur, the Pioneer of Pasteurization, Microbes & VaccinesLouis Pasteur was a French chemist and biologist who proved the germ theory of disease and invented the process of pasteurization. He brilliantly developed the basis for modern bacteriology as a cornerstone of public health, establishing scientific, experimental proof for the germ theory with his demonstration in 1854 of anaerobic microbial fermentation.Pasteur was asked to investigate the threatened destruction of the French silk industry by epidemics destroying the silkworms. His analysis pointed to living microorganisms causing the disease. Consequently, he devised new growing conditions, which eliminated the problem.This, in turn, raised both scientific and industrial interest in the germ theory. In the period 1856\u20131860, he showed how to prevent wine spoilage due to contamination from foreign organisms. His microscopic work helped him to observe that certain liquids went rancid owing to the multiplication of minute organisms in wine, then beer and milk. With more investigation, he saw that these microorganisms could be destroyed by heating the liquid, an important process later termed \u201cpasteurization\". As with the other liquids he worked with, he heated the wine to a certain temperature before bottling it, thus killing the undesired ferments.When he published the concept that the very microorganisms that contaminated the liquids also floated in the air, it was met with ridicule by the medical establishment. The germ theory is the idea that certain microorganisms are responsible for causing many specific diseases. Monumental and groundbreaking for its time, the germ theory drastically influenced the way in which medicine was practiced. Pasteur\u2019s work confirmed previous awareness of the existence of germs and development of the germ theory, so that the discoveries of many scientists were retrospectively recognized as contributing to the understanding of the germ theory.Pasteur moved on to studying solid compounds through experimental trials, demonstrating that microbes were the reason behind the decay of meat. He was confident that this concept explained the development of disease, arguing that the multiplication of germs leads to a specific disease. This was a very significant realization, as it meant that microbes not only affected beer, milk, and various foods, but had the potential to affect humans as well.He succeeded in producing vaccines through attenuation, or weakening an organism\u2019s strength by passing it successively through animals, recovering it, and retransmitting it to other animals. He calculated that if a vaccine can be developed for smallpox, then one can be created for all diseases. In collaboration with physician Charles Chamberland, he inoculated chickens with chicken cholera germs taken from an old culture. Following this, using cholera germs from a new, fresh culture, they inoculated two groups of chickens: those that had previously been inoculated with the old culture, and those that had not. The chickens initially inoculated with the old sample survived, while the other group of chickens did not, demonstrating the initial inoculation of the old culture to be successful in producing immunity to chicken cholera.This experiment illustrated the principles of vaccination; Pasteur\u2019s explanation for it surrounded the idea of weaker germs creating a form of defense and establishing protection to fight the stronger, more potent germs later presented in the fresh sample. In 1883, he produced a similar protective vaccine for swine erysipelas, and then in 1884\u20131885, a vaccine for rabies.Louis Pasteur was a brilliant scientific pioneer whose many outstanding achievements greatly contributed to the advance of medical sciences and public health.Sources: History Learning Site.

Local physicians agreed that because death was certain, Pasteur, a chemist and not a physician, be allowed to treat the boy with a course of immunization. The boy, Joseph Meister, survived, and similar cases were brought to Pasteur and successfully immunized.

These were fundamental to the establishment of the science of bacteriology and the relationship of microorganisms to disease causation.BOX 1.9Koch\u2013Henle Postulates on Microorganisms as the Cause of Disease\n1.The organism (agent) must be shown to be present in every case of the disease by isolation in pure culture.2.The agent should not be found in cases of any other disease.3.Once isolated, the agent should be grown in a series of cultures, and then must be capable of reproducing the disease in experimental animals.4.The agent must then be recovered from the disease produced in experimental animals.\nThese criteria for disease causation by bacteria have been modified to accommodate new scientific knowledge, newly identified organism (e.g., viruses), asymptomatic infections, host and environmental and other factors. However, these postulates were important as basic tools in developing public health science.Sources: Last JM. A dictionary of epidemiology. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press; 2001.Last JM.

Parasitic diseases of animals and humans, including Guinea worm disease, tapeworms, filariasis, and veterinary parasitic diseases such as Texas cattle fever, were investigated in many centers during the nineteenth century. David Bruce (1855\u20131931) demonstrated transmission of nagana (animal African trypanosomiasis), a disease of cattle and horses in Zululand, South Africa, in 1894\u20131895. Nagana is caused by a trypanosome parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly, and its study led to the use of environmental methods of control to halt disease transmission. Alexandre Yersin (1863\u20131943) and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853\u20131931) discovered the plague bacillus in 1894, and in 1898 French epidemiologist P. L.

Laveran persisted, and after ending his military career he continued his research, producing irrefutable evidence that was later validated by other experts. Moreover, other nineteenth-century investigators suspected mosquitoes as the method of transmission, and in 1897, Ronald Ross (1857\u20131932, Nobel Prize 1902), a British army doctor in India, Patrick Manson (1844\u20131922) in England, and Benvenuto Grassi in Rome demonstrated transmission of malaria by the Anopheles mosquito. Yellow fever, probably imported by the slave trade from Africa, was endemic in the southern USA but spread to northern cities in the late eighteenth century. An outbreak in Philadelphia in 1798 killed nearly 8 percent of the population. Outbreaks in New York killed 732 people in 1795, 2086 in 1798, and 606 in 1803.

Working with volunteers, he demonstrated transmission of the disease from person to person by the specific mosquito Stegomyia fasciata. The Commission accepted that \u201cthe mosquito acts as the intermediate host for the parasite of Yellow Fever\u201d.Another US army doctor, William Gorgas (1845\u20131920), applied the new knowledge of transmission of yellow fever and the life cycle of the vector mosquito. He organized a campaign to control the transmission of yellow fever in Havana, isolating clinical cases from mosquitoes and eliminating the breeding places for Stegomyia with Mosquito Brigades.Yellow fever was eradicated in Havana within 8 months. This demonstrated the possibility for control of other mosquito-borne diseases, principally malaria with its specific vector, Anopheles. Gorgas then successfully applied mosquito control to prevent both yellow fever and malaria between 1904 and 1906, permitting construction of the Panama Canal.Sources: McCullough D.

Salk\u2019s field trial proved the safety and efficacy of his vaccine in preventing poliomyelitis. Sabin\u2019s vaccine proved to be cheaper and easier to use on a mass basis and is still the mainstay of polio eradication worldwide (Box 1.12\n). The conquest of this dreaded, disabling, and disfiguring disease has provided one of the most dramatic achievements of public health in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Despite setbacks and economic recession limiting donor funding, there are good prospects for the elimination of poliomyelitis by 2015 or soon thereafter.\nBOX 1.12Salk and Sabin Vaccines and Poliomyelitis EradicationIn the early 1950s, John Enders (1897\u20131985) and colleagues developed methods of growing polio virus in laboratory conditions, for which they were ultimately awarded a Nobel Prize. At the University of Pittsburgh, physician and epidemiologist Jonas Salk (1914\u20131995) developed the first inactivated (killed) vaccine under sponsorship of a large voluntary organization (The March of Dimes), which mobilized the resources to fight this much dreaded disease. In 1954, Salk successfully completed the largest field trial ever, involving 1.8 million children. The vaccine was rapidly licensed and quickly developed and distributed in North America and Europe, interrupting the epidemic cycle and rapidly reducing polio incidence to low levels.Albert Sabin (1906\u20131994) at the University of Cincinnati developed a live, attenuated vaccine given orally (OPV), which was approved by the FDA in 1961. This vaccine was an immediate success as it has many advantages: it is administered easily, spreads its benefits to non-immunized people, and is inexpensive. It became the vaccine of choice and was used widely, thus reducing polio to a negligible disease in most developed countries within a few years. Sabin also pioneered application of OPV through national immunization days in South America, which contributed to the eradication of polio in that region, and more recently, in many other continents and countries.In 1987, the World Health Assembly of the WHO declared the target of eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000. With the help of international and national commitment, the Americas were declared polio free in 1990. A worldwide campaign has been conducted with improved routine immunization coverage, mass immunization days, and localized control measures, resulting in a widening of successful eradication across all continents. By the end of 2010, polio was still active in four countries, with a substantial outbreak in Tajikistan. Total polio cases worldwide declined from 650 cases in 2011 to 97 cases up to 11 July 2012. In 2012, polio remains endemic in Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Congo (DRC), and Chad, while India seems to have been polio free in 2011. Eradication of the natural transmission of the disease is anticipated by 2015, and an end-stage strategy recommended by the WHO will include a combined use of OPV and IPV.Salk vaccine has been adopted by most western countries since 2006, but OPV continues to be used as the basic immunization for polio in most parts of the world, both as routine immunization and in mass immunization campaigns.In 2012, a policy shift in use of polio vaccines occurred: \u201cThe polio eradication endgame plan is to switch from the trivalent oral polio vaccine, currently the vaccine of choice in most countries, to two vaccines: a new bivalent oral polio vaccine for routine immunization backed up by judicious use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)\".Eradication is within sight and the end-game strategy is important. In 2013, spread of Wild Polio Virus type 1 in the sewage in highly immunized Israel suggested that IPV alone may not prevent recurrence of polio spread.Sources: Tulchinsky TH, Goldblum N.

In 1922, Elmer McCollum (1879\u20131967) identified vitamin D in cod liver oil, which became a staple in child care for many decades. Rickets, still common in industrialized countries prior to World War II and into the 1950s, virtually disappeared following fortification of milk with vitamin D.

Pellagra was a common disorder among poor farm families whose diet consisted mainly of corn flour. Pellagra is characterized by the \u201c4 Ds\": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. In 1818, Hameau described a widespread skin disease among poor farmers in southern France. Theophile Roussel (1816\u20131903) investigated and concluded that pellagra was endemic and due to poverty rather than a diet heavy in corn. The French Department of Agriculture implemented his recommended reforms, raising standards of living among poor farmers by encouraging them to grow wheat and potatoes instead of corn. Consequently, the disease disappeared by the beginning of the twentieth century. Similar measures in Italy reduced the growth of corn, and here too the disease disappeared. Lambrozo, in Verona, Italy, reported many cases of pellagra among mental hospital patients, also concluding that it was due to toxic material in corn. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the corn theory was less accepted and the common view was that pellagra was an infectious disease. British investigator L. V. Sambon, discoverer of the role of the tsetse fly in trypanosomiasis in 1910, took the view that the disease was mosquito borne.Pellagra was first reported in the USA in 1906 as an epidemic in a mental hospital in Alabama. In the first decades of the twentieth century, pellagra was considered the leading public health problem in the southern USA, where poverty was rampant, and generally believed to be infectious in origin. Between 1907 and 1940, approximately three million Americans contracted pellagra and 100,000 of them died.In 1913, Joseph Goldberger (1874\u20131929) of the US Public Health Service was appointed by the Surgeon General to investigate the pellagra epidemic in the southern USA. Goldberger had previously worked on yellow fever, dengue, and typhus. He visited psychiatric hospitals and orphanages with endemic pellagra and was struck by the observation that the staff was not affected, suggesting that the disease was not infectious. He recognized that non-transmission from patients to staff suggested a non-infectious cause. He postulated that it may have been due to the diet. In one mental hospital, he eliminated pellagra by adding milk and eggs to the diet and concluded that the disease was due to a lack of vitamins and preventable by a change in diet alone. He went on to establish the nutritional basis of this disease: a landmark in nutritional epidemiology in public health.In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported:\u201cPellagra is a good example of the translation of scientific understanding to public health action to prevent nutritional deficiency. Pellagra, a classic dietary deficiency disease caused by insufficient niacin, was noted in the South after the Civil War. Then considered infectious, it was known as the disease of the four Ds: diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. The first outbreak was reported in 1907. In 1909, more than 1000 cases were estimated based on reports from 13 states. One year later, approximately 3000 cases were suspected nationwide based on estimates from 30 states and the District of Columbia. By the end of 1911, pellagra had been reported in all but nine states, and prevalence estimates had increased nearly ninefold.During 1906\u20131940, approximately 3 million cases and approximately 100,000 deaths were attributed to pellagra. From 1914 until his death in 1929, Joseph Goldberger, a Public Health Service physician, conducted groundbreaking studies that demonstrated that pellagra was not infectious but was associated with poverty and poor diet. Despite compelling evidence, his hypothesis remained controversial and unconfirmed until 1937. The near elimination of pellagra by the end of the 1940s has been attributed to improved diet and health associated with economic recovery during the 1940s and to the enrichment of flour with niacin. Today, most physicians in the United States have never seen pellagra although outbreaks continue to occur, particularly among refugees and during emergencies in developing countries.The growth of publicly funded nutrition programs was accelerated during the early 1940s because of reports that 25% of draftees showed evidence of past or present malnutrition; a frequent cause of rejection from military service was tooth decay or loss. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, which led to the first recommended dietary allowances of nutrients, and resulted in issuance of War Order Number One, a program to enrich wheat flour with vitamins and iron. In 1998, the most recent food fortification program was initiated; folic acid, a water-soluble vitamin, was added to cereal and grain products to prevent neural tube defects.\u201d\nSources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

From studies in Zurich and in the USA, the efficacy of iodine supplements in preventing goiter was demonstrated. In 1924 Morton\u2019s iodized salt became a national standard in the USA; it served as an early and noble example of voluntary public health action by private industry. In 1941, the USA initiated mandatory fortification of \u201ciodine-enriched\u201d salt, as well as flour (iron, vitamins B and later folic acid) and milk (with vitamin D). In Canada, iodized salt became mandatory in 1979 along with other vitamin and mineral fortification of bread and milk (see Chapter 8). Prevention of IDD by salt iodization has become an important goal in international health, and progress is being made towards universal iodization of salt in many countries where goiter, cretinism, and iodine deficiency are still endemic. In 1998, folic acid fortification of flour for prevention of birth defects was adopted in the USA, Canada, and Chile, and by 2013 had been adopted in over 60 other countries.",

They followed the mortality patterns of British patients from different causes, especially lung cancer. They found that mortality rates from lung cancer were 10 times higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Epidemiological studies pointing to the relationship of diet and hypertension with cardiovascular diseases also provided critically important material for public health policy. This raised public concern and consciousness in western countries of the impact and influence of lifestyle on public health. In this new era of public health, the complementary relationship between miasma and germ theories is recognized (Box 1.14\n). These issues are discussed subsequently throughout this book.BOX 1.14Complementarities of the Miasma and Germ TheoriesIn the mid-nineteenth century, the miasma theory (i.e., the concept that airborne vapors or \u201cmiasmata\u201d caused most diseases) competed with the germ theory (i.e., specific microorganisms cause specific diseases). The latter gained pre-eminence among scientists and biological sciences, yet the miasma theory was the basis for action by sanitary reformers. Miasma explained why cholera and other diseases were epidemic in places where the undrained sewage water was foul smelling. Their endeavors led to improved sanitation systems, which resulted in decreased episodes of cholera. The connection between dirtiness and diseases led to public health reforms and encouraged environmental and personal cleanliness. The miasma theory was consistent with the observations that disease was associated with poor sanitation and foul odors, and that sanitary improvements were successful in reducing disease.Echoes of these two theories continue to compete even today. Applied to chronic disease related to toxins (e.g., smoking) or nutritional indicators (e.g., blood lipids and micronutrient deficiency conditions), the environmental focus of the sanitary reformers is reflected in the idea that environmental and social conditions are the main factors in these diseases. This is in contrast to the more biomedically oriented approach of the intellectual descendants of germ theory of infectious diseases. Clearly, both are operative, with improved infectious disease control and environmental and social conditions all contributing to improved longevity and reduced burden of many diseases. However, large gaps remain between rich and poor as a result of differential social, economic, and cultural differences.In 2007, the British Medical Journal conducted an opinion survey of the most important medical innovations of all time. The clear winner was the \u201csanitary revolution as greatest medical advance since 1840\u201d. Major problems remain today, as millions of people die annually from lack of modern sanitation of safe drinking water and poor sewage and solid waste disposal. Other large-scale killers are infectious diseases for which highly effective vaccines or other management tools exist.Even in developed countries, management of infectious diseases is still a major public health issue, and includes the annual loss of life from influenza, pneumonia, medically related diseases such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and the rise of drug-resistant organisms, which were easily controlled by antibiotics a short generation ago. Biomedical and socioecological approaches will need to be combined in the future to address these major issues.Sources: Ferriman A.

Following the Great Depression of the 1930s and hopes raised by the Allied victory in World War II, important social and health legislation was enacted to provide health care to the populations of Britain, Canada, and the USA. In Britain the welfare state including the National Health Service (NHS) was developed by the Labour Government. In Canada, a more gradual development took place in the period from 1946 to 1971, including the establishment of national pensions and a national health insurance program. In the USA, social legislation has been slow in coming following the defeat of national health insurance legislation in Congress in 1946 and long-standing ideological opposition to \u201csocialized medicine\u201d. In 1965, however, universal coverage of the population over age 65 (Medicare) was instituted and coverage for the poor under Medicaid soon followed. Inadequate coverage of workers and low-income American families is still a serious problem, although health reforms initiated by President Barak Obama in 2009 and approved by Congress in 2010 promise to extend health coverage to millions of Americans in the coming years. The Affordable Care Act is politically controversial; however, when challenged in the Supreme Court it was ruled as within constitutional limits. It will add many millions of Americans to health insurance but not yet to universal health care, which is the gold standard in all other developed countries. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, virtually every country has in principle undertaken responsibility to provide for the health and social well-being of its population, but the gaps and inequities in their achievements are wide. The term health systems may imply a formalized structure or a network of functions that work together to meet the needs of a population through health insurance or health service systems. Private health insurance is still the dominant mode in the USA, but the elderly and the poor are covered by government health insurance (see Chapter 13). The American public health community is currently seeking means to achieve universal health coverage. Prepayment for health is financed through general tax revenues in many countries, and in others through payment by workers and employers to social security systems. Both developed and developing countries are involved in financing health care, as well as research and training of health professionals.",

Many countries are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of technology and competition from other social needs, such as education, employment, and social welfare, all of which are important for national health and well-being. Some economic theories allocate no economic value to a person except as an employee and a consumer. Liberal and social democratic political philosophies advocate an ethical concern and societal responsibility for health. Both approaches now concur that health has social and economic value.

The philosophical and ethical basis of modern public health is a belief in the inherent worth of the individual and his or her human right to a safe and healthful environment. The health and well-being of the individual and the community are interdependent. Investment in health, as in education, is a contributor to economic growth, as healthy and educated individuals contribute to a creative and economically productive society.",

The progress made up to 2013 has been substantial in many regions, with reduction in rates of extreme poverty, enrolling children into primary schools, addressing AIDS, malaria and child health, and a good likelihood of reaching the target for access to clean drinking water. Despite this progress, progress in sub-Saharan Africa has been very slow, with no advances at all in addressing maternal mortality rates.",

Organized activity to prevent disease and promote health had to be relearned from the ancient and postindustrial revolution worlds. Over the coming decades of the twenty-first century, we must learn from a wider framework how to use all health modalities, including clinical and prevention-oriented services, health promotion, and proactive efforts in the public and private sectors to effectively and economically preserve, protect, and promote the health of individuals and of greater society. The New Public Health, as public health did in the past, faces ethical issues that relate to health expenditures, priorities, and social philosophy. Throughout the course of this book, we discuss these issues and attempt to illustrate a balanced, modern approach towards the New Public Health.",
