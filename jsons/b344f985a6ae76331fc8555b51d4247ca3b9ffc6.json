Government guidance aside, many companies acted early and self-imposed social distancing and remote working on their employees if their roles allowed it; for example, the only research that can take place on University College London campuses is that which is in the immediate national interest, i.e. research on COVID-19 [21] . Pharmaceutical and medical technology companies are also prioritising their research and development towards COVID-19, working on diagnostic tests, vaccines and/or therapies [22] . Given this and that most new technologies are developed onsite in laboratories, COVID-19 will likely impact the development of future technologies.

NICE's fee-based consultancy service to industry has chosen to offer free scientific fast-track advice for companies developing novel diagnostic, therapeutic and digital health technologies for COVID-19 [30] . With respect to other guidance and guidelines, during the pandemic NICE has decided to publish only work that is either therapeutically critical (this includes cancer medicines, except cancer drugs fund reviews and a small number on non-cancer medicines) or that relates to addressing COVID-19 diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, to avoid distracting the National Health Service (NHS) [31] . Like regulatory agencies, HTA committees may also need to accept alternative analytical approaches where, because of COVID-19, there are missing data [32] or censored data [33] .

Depending on the extent of the pandemic, the way we deliver healthcare could change; there may be a stronger push to deliver care at home and to use digital technologies.",

While NICE COVID-19 guidelines appear to have been issued devoid of formal economic appraisals, it would be unusual for policy makers to adopt treatments and preventative approaches without assessing both effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Different HTA agencies have different levels of oversight, for example, in Australia and New Zealand, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC), respectively, review both pharmaceuticals and vaccines, but in the UK, NICE reviews pharmaceuticals while the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) assesses vaccines [34] . This introduces the potential for different agencies to apply different standards to the many COVID-19 interventions; indeed, NICE has different reference cases for public health interventions and health technologies. Methods aside, policy makers need economic evidence on both costs and outcomes. As of early April, there were 366 COVID-19 studies registered worldwide [35] . A review of several registered clinical trials suggests that few appear to be designed to investigate efficacy [36] and our own search of the European Union Clinical Trials Register (www.clini caltr ialsr egist er.eu) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clini caltr ials.gov) identified no COVID-19 studies that appear to be explicitly collecting resource use, cost or quality-of-life data. Health economists are no strangers to modelling and extrapolating trial data, or making and testing assumptions to undertake HTAs (see [37] for a COVID-19 modelling example); but assumptions should never replace the opportunity to collect actual data, particularly to go beyond clinical outcomes of hospitalisations to consider quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Early HTA can inform research and development during the initial stages of clinical research -potentially important with so many competing treatments being trialled -and help address uncertainty [38] . It is likely that such therapies will be fast tracked through any HTA process (and thereby delay other topics), but faster appraisal may mean drugs are approved that are neither clinically nor cost effective, or there is a greater chance of a negative recommendation as the committee considers there are too many uncertainties.",

The majority of investment in COVID-19 has to date been new funding, i.e. not at the expense of the current healthcare budget although arguably at the expense of the wider economy. This and the various stimulus packages that have been announced globally are the result of quantitative easing and/or government borrowing. In the short run, these stimulus packages will allow the economy and healthcare systems to function, but a global recession is highly likely, and consumer and business confidence will take a hit. Venture capital funding may be difficult to secure, which will add challenges for the life sciences sector bringing new innovations to market.",

Therefore, a well-functioning HTA system (as many countries have) will be critical. What is not clear is whether governments will constrain the budgets of HTA agencies, which would be reflected in part in them facing a lower threshold of cost effectiveness. Given the perceived inflexibility across countries of the threshold [41, 42] , and the disconnect between adoption decisions and budget impact (for example, NICE does not face the opportunity cost of its decisions, NHS England does [43] ) it may be that HTA needs to focus its efforts on 'technology management' rather than 'technology adoption' and evaluate divesting in inefficient services or low-value healthcare [44] . Alternatively, HTA agencies in response to financial uncertainty may become more risk averse, which could be further magnified given the evidence base they will evaluate may be more uncertain because of the current disruption to clinical trials. It may be that faced with such a situation, HTA agencies and other healthcare funders will rely more heavily on other coverage decision approaches such as risk sharing arrangements or managed access schemes [45] . These innovative market access policies may be accompanied by innovations in pricing arrangements, including outcome-based payments [46] , thereby promoting patient access despite the uncertainty in the evidence base and an aversion to risk at times of financial crisis [47] .",
