The majority of the existing studies reported the dynamics and initial estimates of the effective reproduction number from China followed by a few other studies using data from other countries including Italy, Spain, South Korea, Germany, France and Iran among others. However, none of the previous work has taken into account the impact of possible underreporting of cases in estimation of the effective reproduction number. Also, no other study reported the time-dependent association between the interventions and variations in the effective reproduction number for Iran as the hardest hit country in the Middle East.",

            "text": "The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Iran was first officially announced in February 2020, two months after the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. 1 Iran's patient zero is believed to have been a merchant from Qom who had travel history to China. 2 Despite the initial signs of a spread in Qom, the government declined to place the city under quarantine to contain the epidemic at an early stage for various technical, socio-economic, religious, and security reasons. 3 The first local non-pharmaceutical interventions such as schools and universities closure were put in place a few days after the official acknowledgement of the first cases in Qom and Tehran. 4 Since then, various public health control measures at the local and national levels were taken that are believed to have altered the course of the outbreak. See figure 1 for a spatial illustration of the spread throughout the country by province in the first week since the official announcement of the first case (appendix p 1). The relatively high case fatality ratio (CFR), defined as the total number of deaths over the total number of infected cases, in Iran's official reports after the first week since the official declaration of the first case (16.8%) has raised questions on the true number of cases in the country. 5, 6 The testing protocol in Iran at the early stages of the outbreak was limited to hospital admissions of the patients with severe symptoms. While Iran has extended the COVID-19 diagnostic testing capacity later on to patients with milder symptoms, it is believed that under-ascertainment of cases still remains high. This study aims to understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Iran and to assess the effectiveness of the control measures that were put in place over time through estimation of the effective reproduction number \u0734 \u123a \u202b\u0750\u202c \u123b defined as the average number of susceptible persons infected by an infected person during its infectious period at a given time in the course of the epidemic. We assessed \u0734 \u123a \u202b\u0750\u202c \u123b in relation to a timeline of national events and non-pharmaceutical interventions. In the absence of timely and reliable data, modelling can provide helpful answers, including the degree of plausible uncertainty in different estimates and the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions. By providing explicit and clear information about model assumptions and parameters, modelling can also foster scientific discussion of data gaps and what can be done to improve outbreak-related estimates by borrowing information available elsewhere. Finally, models can be developed and presented using both average estimates and measures of their uncertainty or, alternatively, as scenarios that can illustrate possible developments of the epidemic under various conditions.",

We assume the underreporting level remains constant over time.",

With more data emerging after the second week, the CFR dropped to 4.4% on the 14 th day since the declared beginning of the outbreak on February 19, 2020. Later, between 15 March 2020 and 12 April 2020, the CFR stabilized between 5.2% and 7.8% with a mean of 6.7%. See figure 3(c). With the wider spread of COVID-19 across the country, the CFR increased to 7.86% on 23 March 2020. However, the CFR declined and plateaued around 6.2% between 1 and 15 April 2020. The relatively high CFR could correspond to a significant level of under-reporting of the infected cases and an overwhelmed health system. Given the wide distribution of the time from confirmation-to-death of COVID-19, we also explore the delay-adjusted CFR with 5-and 10-day delay period, as examples. The dynamics of the delay-adjusted CFR with 10-day delay suggests that the CFR has been gradually reducing in Iran from 17.97% on 16 March 2020 to 8.20% on 12 April 2020.",

The outbreak is also likely to continue until the end of 2020. See figure 4 . The estimates of the effective reproduction number were consistently larger during the early stage of the outbreak when underreporting is overlooked compared to when underreporting is taken into account. However, the estimated effective reproduction numbers converged as the number of infected cases approached the peak. The convergence of the estimates can be partly explained by the fact that the effective reproduction number is more dependent on the rate of change in the infected and recovered cases rather than their absolute numbers. Results also suggest that the impact of control measures on the effective reproduction number is significantly overestimated when under-reporting is taken into account.",

Here, we conduct a scenario analysis to understand how three different scenarios could change the projected outlook of the outbreak in Iran: i) maintaining the same level of control measures as of 12 April 2020, ii) intensifying the measures to increase physical distancing represented by a 20% reduction in the reproduction number, and iii) partially lifting the restrictions to ease physical distancing represented by a 20% increase in the reproduction number. To estimate the number of ICU beds needed, we assume 5% of the confirmed cases require intensive care. 20 We found that in all scenarios the projection of patients requiring ICU admission exceeds the original ICU capacity. Note that no official information is available on the expanded ICU capacity. As of 12 April 2020, both projected curves start above the ICU capacity. Easing the restrictions can quickly push the peak to a level that is five times higher than the scenario where the current level of control measures is maintained and puts additional pressure on the health system.

The CFR in Turkey as of 6 April 2020 was 2%, three times lower than that of Iran. 8 While the evidence is indirect, it suggests that the official number of cases reported by Iran may has been significantly under-reported, possibly due to relatively low case-ascertainment and under-reporting of identified cases. 18 The continuous reduction in the delay-adjusted CFR shows a different trend compared to the CFR with no consideration of the time from confirmation-to-death. The continuous reduction could be explained by the improving case identification practice in Iran over time with various initiatives including a National Coronavirus Helpline (the \"4030\" service), established in late February 2020 to self-report symptoms and identify suspected cases.",

For example, closure of schools and businesses in the capital city of Tehran near the time of the Persian new year was followed by a surge of holiday trips to Gilan and Mazandaran and a subsequent increase in the number of cases in these provinces and in other parts of the country. This observation shows how interventions may be associated with unintended and at times counterproductive consequences. These negative consequences can be prevented when there is open and credible communications by competent officials and mutual trust between public and government. Moreover, intervention measures need to be developed, implemented and enforced as a whole, for example by strict reinforcement of travel restrictions in conjunction with school and workplace closings.",
