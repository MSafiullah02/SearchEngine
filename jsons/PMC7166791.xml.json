It carries out a full range of diagnostic testing for infectious diseases. The PathWest laboratory database comprises two separate data systems: the Metropolitan Corporate Laboratory Information System, or ULTRA (version 3.2; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA), and the Branch Laboratory Information System (BLIS; PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, Australia). The ULTRA database contains information on all pathology testing conducted in the metropolitan region and information concerning specimens collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, virology testing and serology throughout WA. BLIS contains bacteriology data from rural and remote PathWest laboratories in WA. Data were extracted from both the ULTRA and BLIS systems for all children in the birth cohort who had samples collected to identify any respiratory pathogen between 2000 and 2005. Specimens were classified as bronchial specimens, upper respiratory specimens (NPAs and nose swabs), tracheal specimens, pleural fluid, sputum, blood specimens, cerebrospinal fluid, and throat and eye swabs.",

At PMH, if a specimen is negative for this standard respiratory panel, the specimen is then investigated for picornaviruses and hMPV. At the central PathWest laboratory in Perth, respiratory samples received for viral testing are routinely investigated for picornaviruses and hMPV. Therefore, information on the identification of the following viruses was extracted: RSV, influenza viruses A and B, adenoviruses, PIV1\u20103, picornaviruses (only enteroviruses and rhinoviruses) and hMPV. Positive and negative results for virology were recorded. Respiratory viruses were identified using one or more of the following: direct immunofluorescence (all viruses except picornaviruses and hMPV), PCR (all viruses) and viral culture (all viruses except hMPV). PCR testing commenced in 2002 for picornaviruses and in 2003 for hMPV. Prior to those dates, rhinoviruses were identified by cell culture, while hMPV could not be detected. Enteroviruses and rhinoviruses were combined as picornaviruses as the PCR methods in use did not accurately distinguish between the two groups.",

Following request by the treating doctor, S. pneumoniae was also detected by PCR from a sterile specimen, such as blood, pleural fluid or cerebrospinal fluid. PCR or the detection of Bordetella pertussis\u2010specific IgA in nasal secretions or culture were used to detect B. pertussis.\n18\n These diagnostic methods have been consistently performed between 2000 and 2005.

This was to ensure that we included specimens collected as an outpatient or in emergency departments before admission, as well as those collected shortly after admission.

The hospital admissions that linked to a laboratory record had a longer length of stay in the hospital (mean 4.3 days) than admissions that did not link to a laboratory record (mean 3.2 days; z = 5.94, P < 0.001). In a multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for length of stay in days, Aboriginal children, males, admissions to a private hospital or admissions from rural and remote areas and children aged 6 months or older were less likely to have a linked laboratory record. Linkage improved over time with 40% of hospitalisations in 2000 linking to a laboratory record, compared with 50% in 2005 (Table 1).

In particular, the number of blood cultures that linked to a hospital record was very low. It is likely that blood cultures are not being routinely collected from all children admitted with ALRI. One possibility is that we are missing laboratory data from some rural and remote areas as there were separate BLIS data systems during the period of the study that needed to be combined prior to analysis. A second possibility is the limited ability to collect blood cultures from patients in rural and remote areas as we have shown that children from the metropolitan area who were hospitalised were more likely to have a linked laboratory record. This requires further investigation to obtain a good estimate of the burden of invasive bacterial infection. We are, however, confident that all specimens tested for respiratory viruses are included in our dataset. The third possibility for the low number of blood cultures is that as approximately half of ALRI admissions are bronchiolitis, managing clinicians may view a blood culture as unnecessary.",

Although it is recommended standard practice at PMH to collect a specimen for respiratory pathogen testing for a standard panel of respiratory viruses, this may not be routinely conducted in other non\u2010metropolitan or private hospitals. Again, this is reflected in our findings where linkage to a laboratory record was less likely among those admissions to a private hospital or a hospital outside the metropolitan area. Our data include information from several laboratories over a period of 5 years where tests and standard procedures may differ or change over time. However, as we have been able to document what tests were conducted for a certain pathogen and specimen, our proportions of positive identification combined with absolute numbers of pathogens identified are useful in terms of documenting the aetiology of ALRI hospitalisations.",

In particular, pneumonia admissions have a varied aetiology with no clear pathogen dominating, which has been reported in numerous prospective studies in developing countries.\n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n Data regarding the aetiology of pneumonia and other ALRIs in developed countries are scarce, but the contribution of RSV, influenza viruses, PIV, and S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae has been noted.\n23\n When picornaviruses were tested, high identification rates were noted for all categories of ALRI.

These rates need to be interpreted with caution as B. pertussis investigations are not routinely requested and might be indicative of an atypical clinical picture or asymptomatic infection. Nevertheless, the number of B. pertussis notifications has been increasing in Australia with peak activity recorded for 2001 and 2005.\n25\n In WA, 2004 was an epidemic year for B. pertussis\n\n26\n which might have led to more testing, and therefore an increase in the proportion positive. The potential role of B. pertussis in bronchiolitis has also been noted in a Finnish study where 8.5% of infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis, and all tested for B. pertussis before 6 months of age, recorded a positive identification.\n27\n The identification of B. pertussis was higher in our study, albeit in a small proportion of children tested for B. pertussis. Additionally, hospitalisations where B. pertussis has been identified may have been misdiagnosed as bronchiolitis, indicating that studies based on hospital discharge diagnosis alone may not accurately measure the burden of pertussis. Until B. pertussis can be investigated routinely in children hospitalised with ALRI, the true burden of this pathogen and its role in the aetiology of ALRI will remain unknown.",

The number of studies utilising population\u2010based data linkage is growing in Australia, and it is likely to be a powerful resource to document the pathogen\u2010specific burden of ALRI and more accurately determine the impact of intervention programmes, such as vaccination. From 2007, all laboratory data systems within PathWest were rolled into one central ULTRA database. This will allow future linkages with hospital morbidity data through the WADLS to be more streamlined, and the possibility of missing laboratory records for linkage will be reduced. Further analyses of these linked data will also allow calculation of sensitivity and specificity of ICD diagnosis codes for various ALRI diagnoses. We are also planning to validate a subset of linked records against their medical records and laboratory request forms. Despite the limitations that we have mentioned, these population\u2010based data cover a range of different tests and pathogens over a 5\u2010year period and provide estimates of the aetiology of ALRI hospitalisation in Australian Aboriginal and non\u2010Aboriginal children.",

We have reiterated that ALRI is predominantly viral in young children and RSV is the predominant pathogen. However, picornaviruses and B. pertussis should be investigated routinely in children hospitalised with ALRI so that the true burden of these pathogens can also be determined.
