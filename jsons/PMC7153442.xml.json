Their functions may be altered by immunosuppressive agents and viral infection. During prolonged neutropenic phases, the number of alveolar macrophages decreases, and this could favor infection from pathogens, which are normally phagocyted at the alveolar level [6]. Additionally, after allogeneic HSCT, the recipient alveolar macrophages are progressively replaced by cells of donor origin, and this may partly explain the numeric and functional impairment of the alveolar macrophage population during the first months after transplant [7, 8].",

The changes in many transplant procedures, including various prophylaxes, and the availability of new diagnostic tools over the last decade should have changed the incidence of pneumonia after HSCT. However, there is no clear data to support this hypothesis, and one may consider that these changes have more resulted in a change in timing and causes of pneumonia rather than in incidence or mortality. The increasing use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens has significantly decreased the formerly high rate of early bacterial pneumonias. However, concomitantly, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a global concern in most hematology wards [9, 10]. The use of RICs has also changed the kinetics of many complications, delaying the onset of GVHD and the subsequent infections [11, 12]. Preemptive and prophylactic strategies of CMV infection have also considerably reduced the incidence of CMV pneumonia which nowadays affects less than 6 % of the patients [13, 14]. However, pneumonia due to respiratory viruses has become common. New antifungal agents have improved therapeutic options for Aspergillus infection, but non-Aspergillus molds, especially mucormycoses, are being seen with increasing frequency [15\u201318]. Finally, despite significant progresses, the morbidity and mortality of pneumonia after HSCT remains one of the highest of any transplant.",

Early immunization with the 13-valent conjugate vaccine, completed by the 23-valent polysaccharide later, or a fourth dose of the conjugate vaccine in case of GVHD could reduce the incidence of pneumococcal infection over time [25, 26] (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-28797-3_48).

It reportedly occurs after 0\u201320 % of transplantations; the most common site is the lung, and GVHD is the main risk factor (see Chap. X). A first peak of incidence occurs during the neutropenic period after myeloablative conditioning regimens, particularly in patients with leukemia. The second incidence peak is generally seen later in patients with acute GVHD and receiving corticosteroids. The availability of antifungal azoles for anti-aspergillus prophylaxis has significantly reduced the incidence [31\u201333]. However, the mortality of Aspergillus remained close to 50 % in recent series. This infection must be considered in any case of fever, particularly in that occurring in the patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics, or of any pneumonia, whether of new onset or a previously diagnosed condition that does not resolve with appropriate therapy (see Figure 16-3). A negative bronchoscopy result, even when combined with testing of galactomannan in the BAL fluid, does not diminish the suspicion for this pathogen. Without secondary prophylaxis eventually combined with surgical removal of the main lesions, the risk of relapse of prior Aspergillus infection after HSCT has been estimated around 20 % [34].\n",

Its mortality rate is between 50 and 80 % [18, 35\u201337]. Mucormycosis shares with aspergillosis common risk factors but usually occurs later, and often after voriconazole administration, although the role of a selection pressure is debated [35]. There is no indirect available marker of mucormycosis except PCR test currently in evaluation [38]. The classical presentation of mucormycosis after transplant mostly mimics aspergillosis, but galactomannan is negative (see Figure 16-4). Differentiating mucor from aspergillus infection is, however, of great importance due to different therapeutic implications. As long as there is a doubt between the two infections, the patient must be treated with liposomal amphotericin B.\n",

This incidence has dramatically decreased between 1 and 2.5 % [41, 42] with the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis, but the mortality in established PjP remains around 50\u201370 % [43\u201345]. However, in patients receiving dapsone prophylaxis, an incidence of 7.2 % was reported after allogeneic HSCT [43]. PjP usually manifests with fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and diffuse interstitial pneumonitis. In HSCT recipients, the presentation of PjP may be extremely abrupt, and the patient may quickly deteriorate and require intensive care unit (ICU) [46\u201348]. Rarely, the disease may reveal by an isolated low-grade fever and a normal chest X-ray at the beginning. In such cases, if the cause of fever is not rapidly found, a CT scan will show pulmonary ground-glass lesions and prompt a BAL [49]. The elevation of LDH is poorly helpful [46]. Most patients present with nodular infiltrates or other pattern of diffuse interstitial pneumonia. Pleural effusion and pneumothorax are uncommon [44]. Most cases occur between 3 and 24 months after transplant, in patients with acute or chronic GVHD or in relapse of the underlying disease [42, 43, 49, 50]. Most are receiving steroids, especially at a phase of tapering off, or after recent withdrawal, and do not receive, or are not compliant to, TMP-SMX prophylaxis [51]. Whether a low CD4 count is a main risk factor for developing PjP after HSCT is unknown.",

IF has a better sensitivity than conventional stainings [52, 53]. The combination of one classical staining and IF allows the detection of both cystic and trophic forms.

Serum (1-3) \u03b2(beta)-d-glucan is a major cell wall component of P. jirovecii. Two meta-analyses [62, 63] have shown its excellent sensitivity, but due to its panfungal nature and the frequency of other IFD after HSCT, it can be only a screening tool for PjP. On the other hand, its use in BAL fluid is not recommended, due to a poor sensitivity and reproducibility [64, 65]. The recent guidelines of the fifth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia [66] propose a practical algorithm for the diagnostic of PjP in non-HIV-infected patients, based on the examination of BAL fluid with IF and qPCR. The positivity or negativity of both techniques signs the presence or absence of PjP. When IF is positive, and qPCR negative, this should reflect a technical problem, mainly of qPCR. When qPCR is the only positive assay, although no quantitative cutoff can be uniformly proposed, a high fungal burden favors a diagnosis of PjP. The concomitant positivity of serum (1-3) \u03b2(beta)-d-glucan is an additional argument favoring PjP. When BAL is not possible because the patient is too hypoxemic or refuses the procedure, serum (1-3) \u03b2(beta)-d-glucan can be helpful in conjunction with URT samples. When the clinical suspicion of PjP is high and the BAL cannot be done immediately, an empirical treatment with TMP-SMX should be started as soon as possible since it will not impair the diagnostic yield of investigative procedures before at least several days. TMP-SMX at the dose of 15\u201320 mg/kg of TMP plus 75\u2013100 mg/kg of SMX, by oral or preferably IV route, is the first choice for treatment [67], even in patients who were supposed to take TMP-SMX prophylaxis as the presence of dihydropteroate synthase mutations does not significantly affect the treatment efficacy [68]. The addition of steroids for the more hypoxemic patients (PaO2 while breathing room air <70 mmHg), although well established in HIV-infected patients [69], is debated in others.",

Preemptive and prophylactic strategies have greatly decreased its incidence, currently in the range of 1\u20135 % [14, 74\u201376]. It is generally a febrile disease in which the radiographic patterns are primarily interstitial but sometimes alveolar. Coinfections are frequent. The optimal approach to identify the virus in the lungs is the combination of IF and rapid culture of BAL fluid. The identification of CMV through PCR on BAL fluid has been shown to have limited correlation with the development of CMV pneumonia and therefore is not considered as criteria for CMV pneumonia [77] (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-28797-3_24). Therefore, as most of the laboratories abandon IF assays to more automated qPCR techniques, a careful examination of the BAL smears by an experimented cytologist is important to detect the cytological hallmarks of CMV pneumonia, knowing that the identification of the characteristic inclusions in alveolar cells is a sign of advanced infection [78] (see Figure 16-6).\n",

Recently, an immunodeficiency scoring system has been proposed to predict poor outcomes and better identify patients infected by respiratory syncytial virus and who should benefit the most from antiviral therapy [83]. The incidence is lower after autologous than after allogeneic transplant [84]. Identification by NAT in respiratory samples is the recommended technique and may be performed on nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, bronchial aspiration, or BAL fluid [79, 85, 86] with multiplex assays. Diagnosing these patients early has several benefits: [1] some of these infections may be efficiently treated (e.g., oseltamivir in influenza infection or ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus); [2] all of them imply isolation and barrier measures to prevent transmission to other patients or staff; [3] respiratory viral infections early after allogeneic transplant predict the development of alloimmune lung syndrome, including bronchiolitis obliterans and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia [79, 87, 88].

Every effort must be made to quickly obtain chest X-rays of optimal quality and/or a high-resolution chest CT scan when easily available. X-rays in supine position are rarely helpful. Additionally, most X-ray patterns are nonspecific and many patients have mixed types of infiltrates. When an X-ray appears negative or shows only minimal changes, there is good evidence that a chest CT may reveal abnormalities. CT scan has the best negative predictive value to rule out pneumonia and will show lung images 5 days before chest X-ray [111]. CT may additionally provide localization of the lesions, guiding invasive procedures, and inform on their proximity to pulmonary vessels. This information is also important to evaluate the risk of hemoptysis in aspergillosis. CT may also detect small pleural effusions. Some CT findings may suggest the presence of particular infections. For example, the halo sign\u2014a macronodule (\u22651 cm in diameter) surrounded by a perimeter of ground-glass opacity\u2014is very evocative of early aspergillosis during neutropenia [112], but may also be seen in other infections (e.g., legionella, mycobacterial infection, mucormycosis, or viral infections). Similarly, the reversed halo sign or \u201catoll sign\u201d\u2014a focal ground-glass attenuation surrounded by a ring of consolidation\u2014has been shown to be often due to mucormycosis in hematology patients, but may also be observed in other infections, including aspergillosis [113]. Ground-glass opacities are very nonspecific and consistent with any infectious and many noninfectious processes such as pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. However, even with more characteristic lesions\u2014such as the air crescent sign which is rare after HSCT but very evocative of mold infection\u2014a CT scan does not replace the need for identification of the pathogen for diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually does not provide more information than CT, except in the detection of lung abscesses [114]. The usefulness of PET scan is limited for diagnosis of acute pneumonia but may be better in nodular, subacute lesions [115], to identify extrapulmonary lesions or to follow the treatment efficacy [116\u2013118]. Any workup using imaging should be completed rapidly, and it should lead quickly to a diagnostic procedure or, in most cases, to an empiric approach considering the most likely hypotheses.",

A meta-analysis of 27 studies showed that the galactomannan test has a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.89 for proven invasive aspergillosis [119]. The assay seems to be more useful for the prospective screening of neutropenic patients rather than for diagnosing pneumonia and also more useful in neutropenic than in non-neutropenic patients [120, 121]. The cutoff of positivity usually recommended is an index \u22650.5 in plasma or serum [121]. In an autopsy-based study, the sensitivity and specificity of the serum (1-3) \u03b2(beta)-d-glucan test for the detection of IFD were 95.1 % and 85.7 %, respectively [122]. Serum (1-3) \u03b2(beta)-d-glucan test is also very useful in the indirect diagnosis of PjP [63, 123].

Oxygen saturation or arterial pressure should be assessed before the procedure. Fever, transient hypoxemia, and worsening of chest X-rays may be expected in as many as one half of patients during the few hours following the procedure [127]. When the patient is hypoxemic (paO2 < 70 mmHg spontaneously or with O2 supplementation) or tachypneic before BAL, he usually benefits from noninvasive ventilation immediately after the procedure. The overall diagnostic yield of BAL in infectious pneumonia occurring in hematologic patients varies between 27 and 55 % [2, 95, 128\u2013131] depending on many parameters such as the following:The localization of the pulmonary lesions: whether they are accessible by BAL or not.Whether the patient is neutropenic. The yield of the procedure is usually lower in neutropenic than in non-neutropenic patients [131].The type of the causal infection: for example, the diagnostic yield of BAL with conventional mycological techniques\u2014without galactomannan tested in the BAL fluid\u2014for aspergillus pneumonia is usually lower than 50 %, while it is higher than 90 % in PjP or CMV pneumonia, for which one rarely needs a lung biopsy [67].The laboratory exams performed on fibroscopic samples. The laboratory protocol should be established in advance in a multidisciplinary approach according to the expected, infectious and noninfectious, causes of pneumonia, eventually adapted to seasons for respiratory viruses.The criteria used to define specific entities. For example, it is generally believed that the presence of candida in a BAL fluid or bronchial aspiration does not necessary mean a candida pneumonia, while the presence of aspergillus in an HSCT recipient does [132]. However, for some causes of pneumonia, there are until now no consensus definition. The increasing availability of NAT for many pathogens should not replace, in many instances, more classical techniques, until the need for classical techniques is shown to be no longer useful in diagnosing a given infection.The delay elapsed between presentation and BAL and the number and duration of previous antibiotics before performing BAL [133]. The diagnostic yield of BAL has been shown to be better when it is performed early after the onset of pulmonary symptoms. In a series of 297 HSCT patients who underwent a BAL, the diagnostic yield of the procedure was 56.8 % in patients since less than 24 h versus 32.8 % in the others [131]. In another study, the diagnostic yield was 73 % in patients who underwent BAL within 4 days of presentation and 31 % thereafter [2]. This may be due to the effect of previous anti-infectives on the probability to identify a pathogen, but also to the fact that lung inflammatory lesions may persist some time after the infection is controlled, so that delayed BAL may be performed in patients with a favorable outcome but still imaging and clinical signs. Therefore, it is recommended to do a BAL as soon as possible.Finally, although pneumonia is less frequent after autologous than after allogeneic HSCT, the diagnostic yield of BAL has been reported to be lower in pneumonia occurring after autologous rather than after allogeneic HSCT [133].\n",

The use of predictive scores\u2014such as the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) [147]\u2014assessed at ICU transfer in HSCT recipients is debated [148]. Patients with acute respiratory failure benefit from ICU support and can be investigated by BAL, knowing that BAL does not increase the need for mechanical ventilation [149]. The prognosis of ICU support is usually better in autologous rather than in allogeneic HSCT recipients, and those with severe acute GVHD and under corticosteroids usually do not clearly benefit from ICU support [146]. Guidelines should be adapted to new data, but, in general, the clinician should consider the individual\u2019s chance of survival and of return to an acceptable life before transferring the patient to an ICU. The patient and the family should be provided with reasonable estimations of prognosis before transfer; in addition, the likelihood of continuing life support should be considered regularly during the course of treatment.

Because of the predictable timing of some infections after most types of transplantations, some prophylactic regimens have been instituted with far-reaching benefits. However, any change in the transplant procedure, conditioning, or immunosuppressive regimen may affect the incidence and cause of infectious pneumonia. Additionally, new pathogens are emerging, and familiar pathogens are becoming more resistant. A high level of suspicion when pneumonia occurs in a transplant recipient and vigilance in diagnosing and treating will continue to be required to prevent an increase in mortality from pneumonia. The development of indirect diagnostic procedures is essential in the evaluation of pneumonia, but their clinical pertinence must be established in large prospective studies, and, until now, they do not replace direct investigation of the lung, mainly by BAL.",
