Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, CI 1.43\u20133.87, P = 0.001) and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 2.87, CI 1.70\u20134.83, P < 0.001), cerebrovascular disease (HR 3.26, CI 1.66\u20136.40, P = 0.001) and COPD (HR 3.72, CI 1.94\u20137.13, P < 0.001) were all predictive of fatal outcomes. Complications including acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, acute kidney injury (AKI), ARDS, cardiac insufficiency and bacterial infection were all predictors of death. The models used in the univariate analysis were tested by Likelihood ratio test, Wald test and Score (log-rank) test and all the three methods supported the significance of the models. Then the \u201cAge\u201d factor was added to correct the models for the multi-factor regressions of comorbidities and complications (Fig. 2\n). In the multi-factor analysis, only cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, CI 1.06\u20133.26, P = 0.031), COPD (HR 2.24, CI 1.12\u20134.50, P = 0.023) and ARDS (HR 29.33, CI 12.37\u201369.58, P < 0.001) remained to be the predictors for death when other factors in the model kept constant, while the contributions of other factors were no longer significant in the model. Among the vital signs, increased heart rate and respiration rate could increase the likelihood of fatal outcomes. For the laboratory tests, white blood cell count (HR 1.16, CI 1.14\u20131.20, P < 0.001) and prothrombin time (HR 1.17, CI 1.13\u20131.24, P < 0.001) were shown to increase the risk of death, and a low level of lymphocytes was a strong predictor of poor outcome (HR 0.10, CI 0.04\u20130.22, P < 0.001). Significances were also found in other factors such as procalcitonin and hypersensitive troponin I. However, for those factors the HR was around 1.0, which limited their values as predictors.",

The reported proportion of severe-to-critical patients in the whole population was 18.5% and the case-fatality rate was 2.3%,9 significantly lower than the present study. As Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was a designated hospital for severe COVID-19 patients, the proportion of severe and critical patients and fatality rate might be different from other centers. In the 65 dead cases 92.3% were critically ill. The only one death in moderate cases was caused by sudden cardiac death. As indicated by the short length of stay (median, 5 days) for the dead, the disease progressed considerably fast for those patients. The most common symptoms at admission were fever, cough, dyspnea and fatigue, which was consistent with the general symptoms of viral infection and pneumonia. Dyspnea was more prevalent in the dead patients. In consistence, the respiration rate at admission was significantly higher in the dead group compared with survival group. The incidence of comorbidities was relatively higher in the elderly COVID-19 patients compared with the whole population.9 The most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. The median heart rate, blood pressure and respiration rate were in the normal range at admission both in survival and dead group, indicating that the vital signs of most patients were stable at admission. Common complications during hospitalization were bacterial infection, liver enzyme abnormalities, ARDS and acute cardiac injury.",

In addition, more frequent coagulation disorders, myocardial injuries and bacterial infections were found in the dead group compared to the survival group, as revealed by the related markers.

Dyspnea and high respiration rates were probably manifestations for impaired respiratory function and might reflect the severity of lung lesions caused by infection or inflammation. The impaired oxygenation caused by COVID-19 brings great challenge to the cardiopulmonary function, especially for the elderly. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and COPD could greatly increase the vulnerability of elderly patients when faced with this disease. It is reasonable that these factors could predict poor outcomes. ARDS, the fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia, could be a marker of rapid progress of the disease. Once ARDS occurred, the 28-day mortality would be near 50%.10 Consistent with that, in the present study, the occurrence of ARDS was an extremely strong predictor of fatal outcomes, which could increase the probability of death by a factor of 29.3. In laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia were found in around 60% of the overall patients and in 81.5% of the dead patients, which was similar with previous studies on SARS.11 It has been reported that lymphocytes could be killed by coronavirus due to the damage of the cytoplasmic components or apoptosis.12\n,\n13 The degree of lymphocytopenia might reveal either the severity of virus invasion or the condition of the antiviral immunity, thus could predict the outcome.",
