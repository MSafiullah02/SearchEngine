One area of concern expressed at that time was what role dental schools should play in emergency preparedness. The participants at this meeting concluded that bioterrorism training should occur in the predoctoral dental curriculum and should include training that allows dental students to recognize disease, aid in triage, implement preventive measures, and assist in treatment under the direction of emergency-response agencies. 1 In this article we describe New York University College of Dentistry's (NYUCD) effort to build a catastrophe preparedness curriculum for our D ue to the changes this nation has undergone since September 11, 2001, the need for a large force of health care providers trained to react to a major disaster in a surge environment, where the need for medical services far exceeds the resources available, has grown considerably. In an attempt to ensure that the public and private health care systems in the United States are capable of responding to emergencies, the federal government has directed financial and logistic resources to strengthen the emergencyresponse system, create medication stockpiles, and improve the public health infrastructure. Emergency medicine will always have to be ready to confront another crisis, and in many of these catastrophic events, as we have recently seen during Katrina, the emergency medical system itself may be overwhelmed and/or totally crippled. As a consequence of the heightened awareness and needs associated with emergency response, predoctoral students. The faculty of NYUCD used the competencies, goals, and objectives as proposed by More et al. for the development of this curriculum (see Table 1 ). These competencies are based on the recognition that the knowledge and skills possessed by the average dental student upon graduation may be utilized by the public health care system in times of crisis. 2",

            "text": "1. Why should dentists be concerned and involved? 2. How can dentists respond to a catastrophe as part of the organized public health response system? 3. What additional practical training is useful for dentists? 4. How can the average general dentists prepare to protect themselves if a disaster occurs when they are in their offices? The first question-why should dentists be concerned and involved with catastrophe preparedness?-is of such critical importance that it was ad-dressed in an introductory lecture delivered by the dean of the dental school. The lecture emphasized to the students their obligation to the profession, to the community, to their own families, and to their country. The lecture reminded students of the skills they bring with them in the event of an emergency. The opportunities available to join an organized response effort such as the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) are discussed. Additionally, the dean described the abilities that graduate dentists can utilize in an emergency situation; for example, if dentists can accurately administer an inferior alveolar nerve block injection in the recesses of the mouth, they can certainly \"hit\" the large deltoid muscle in the arm to administer a smallpox vaccination with minimal training. 4 The second course theme addressed the question of why dentists should participate in the community's established and organized disaster response system. The approach taken to achieve this objective was to use an existing surge response public health mechanism. NYUCD has had a close relationship with the New York City Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) for several years, ever since NYUCD and the city conducted a simulated Point of Dispensing (POD) exercise together. The MRC developed by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) consists of a multidisciplinary group of volunteer health professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, mental health practitioners, and others, who can be mobilized rapidly during a public health emergency. The MRC/NYC works in partnership with professional associations, universities, and hospitals. As an example, a bioterrorist attack may require mass antibiotic/vaccination prophylaxis. To dispense antibiotics or vaccine to the public, Point-of-Dispensing clinics (PODs) would be set up. POD functions include medical evaluation, triage, vaccination or distribution of medication, and line management. Clinical/support roles are assigned to each professional based on his or her skills and licensure. 5 During a three-hour POD drill, with an improvised scenario, the NYUCD's main auditorium was transformed into a smallpox vaccine dispensing center as our senior students acted as both members of the MRC (triaging, evaluating, dispensing, and inoculating the public) and as patients eagerly looking for answers and protection. The exercise was filmed for use in future classes and to help demonstrate that dentists, with their strong background in infection control, biological agents, collecting medical histories, and patient management, can relatively quickly be organized into an effective, much-needed component of the catastrophe response system.",

The NDLS courses stress a comprehensive all-hazards approach to help physicians and other health professionals deal with catastrophic emergencies from terrorist acts as well as from explosions, fires, natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), and infectious diseases. The program consists of three levels of courses of increasing clinical complexity: 1) Core Disaster Life Support (CDLS), 2) Basic Disaster Life Support (BDLS), and 3) Advanced Disaster Life Support (ADLS). 6 The first component (CDLS) of this hierarchal set of training courses was chosen for its practicality and to introduce those students interested in this material to the possibilities for further training. Core Disaster Life Support is a four-hour instructor-led course designed for all public health care personnel and social workers, clergy, mental health personnel, and planners. CDLS is intended to provide a basic uniform standard of competencies, skills, and knowledge to health care and public health responders for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) response. There was strong agreement among the faculty involved in our bioterrorism preparedness curriculum that since this \"formal\" presentation already existed, there was no need to initiate and develop another appropriate program.",

This is a plan that would allow the college to prepare, respond, and recover from any man-made or natural disaster during the first seventy-two hours of an incident. It is focused on the realization that the major decision to be made is whether we should evacuate the building or use the inherent protection of the structure to shelter in place. The NYUCD student body is therefore aware of the need for anticipating and planning for a possible attack or disaster. It has been shown that the positive behavioral response of individuals goes a long way toward mitigating the consequences of a serious event and has important implications for the practical management of a disaster scene.",

Interestingly, many students used a likely event related to the particular state in which they thought they would practice.

Evaluation questions included: 1. Did students graduate with sufficient knowledge of the clinical signs and symptoms and preven-of the D4 students about various aspects of catastrophe preparedness. The underlying assumption was that students' attitudes about catastrophe preparedness would be changed as a consequence of the curriculum experiences described in this article. A survey (which had received an IRB-exempt designation) was administered on the first day of the D4 course. The survey appears in Figure 1 . Senior students were requested to self-assess their knowledge about bioterrorism and their confidence in their competency on that issue. The same survey was administered after the course. The preliminary data from the pilot program suggested that student attitudes were changed after the course. They saw more aspects of catastrophe preparedness as \"important\" and said the program made them feel more \"confident\" to assume a role as a responder. 3 We describe only the initial impressions of data here because we have yet to have it fully statistically analyzed and it is secondary to the description of the program this article presents-a program that we feel should invoke discussion and debate in the dental academic community. It is our intention to analyze the data and present the findings of the student assessment in a future article that will offer a full and complete picture of the students' response. Following the initial More et al. article and this current article, an analytical third article would complete the sequence regarding catastrophic preparedness training for dental students.",
