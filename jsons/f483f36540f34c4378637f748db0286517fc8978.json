The dynamic isolation concept proposed by author in 2002 [1] can be established completely [2] . The dynamic isolation is relative to the static isolation which means the application of the barrier (such as closing the air-proof door) and the static pressure difference to prevent leakage through gap. This concept has been adopted by Beijing local standard DB11/663-2009 \"Essential construction requirements of negative pressure isolation wards\". It has also been applied in the design and the construction of negative pressure isolation ward in different places.",

            "text": "According to the field test by author, the maximum air velocity induced by occupant movement is 0.34 m/s when the walking velocity is 1 m/s. The air velocity indoors created by air supply from air conditioner is usually not larger than 0.3 m/s. The air velocity in normal room with natural ventilation is not larger than 0.2 m/s, which means that the air velocity induced through the gap will not be larger than 0.5 m/s. From Eq. (3.2) , when the air velocity through the gap is 0.5 m/s, the theoretical pressure difference can be calculated with: DP \u00bc qv 2 2u 2 \u00bc 1:2 \u00c2 0:5 2 2 \u00c2 0:82 2 \u00bc 0: 22 Pa This means that in theory when the door is closed and the pressure difference reaches 0.22 Pa, the requirement for common leakage prevention can be satisfied. It has been pointed out early that when DP = 1 Pa the air velocity through the gap in theory could reach 1.06 m/s [4] , which could counteract the leakage completely. After the epidemic of SARS, it has been pointed out by \"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in HealthCare Facilities\" published in 1994 by CDC that for maintenance of the negative pressure and prevention of air flow into the ward, the minimum pressure difference is extremely small (0.001 in H 2 O). It was considered that with the pressure difference 0.001 in H 2 O, the leakage flow rate could reach 50 ft 3 /min (85 m 3 /h). In this case, the minimum air velocity of leakage air sucked inwardly is 100 ft/min, which corresponds to 0.51 m/s. The static pressure 0.001 in H 2 O corresponds to 0.25 Pa. With Eq. (3.2) , the corresponding ideal air velocity through the gap is 0.53 m/s. Table 3 .1 shows the requirements of pressure difference in isolation ward from standards abroad. In U.S.A., the pressure difference increases from the initial value 0.25 Pa to the current value 2.5 Pa. The reason why the pressure difference should be increased by ten time is not explained.",

The other is that 5 Pa corresponds to 0.5 mm H 2 O. It is the half of the smallest scale of the manometer in the metric system, which means the resolution is 0.5 mm. Therefore, in imperial unit system the half of the smallest scale is adopted as the minimum pressure difference, which is 0.05 in H 2 O or 1.27 mm H 2 O or 12.5 Pa. For the purpose of automatic control, in order to prevent too much instantaneous fluctuation of the pressure difference, it is impossible to maintain 5 Pa, so it is possible to use 10 Pa. When the relative pressure difference is too much, such that larger than 30 or 50 Pa, the people or the little creature will feel uncomfortable.

The leakage rate reduced by 40 and 60% when the pressure difference is \u22126 and \u221230 Pa, respectively.

For HEPA filter C, the filtration efficiency for the spray strain reached 99.999997%. Both efficiency of these two kinds of filters are larger than the measured efficiency with atmospheric dust. This is consistent with the aforementioned factor of equivalent diameter of microorganism.

This is also consistent with the relationship of the filtration efficiency with atmospheric dust between two products.",

From Chap. 5, the final size of the solute is 0.16 \u00c2 3 = 0.48 lm, so it should be added into the size of naked bacteria. Since the size of the spore is about 1 lm, the increase of the linear thickness on the surface can be ignored. Table 3 .29 illustrates the efficiency for spores with different diameters. Based on the measurement result from Table 3 .28, the measured efficiency is within the range of the calculated efficiency for spores with diameter 0.8 and 0.9 lm. From Table 3 .24, the concentration at the air supply outlet, when HEPA filter C was applied, was in the order of the natural number magnitude. This means for such high efficiency in experiment, when the bacteria concentration was increased by an order of magnitude, the measured efficiency may become higher.",
