In this regard, MOS field effect transistors or MOSFET 2 is the main and basic component of most of the electronic systems nowadays. Among the numerous parameters of these systems, MOSFET gate length, which is a critical criterion of integrated circuits, will decrease to about 10 nm in 2016 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The predicted process of decrement of the gate length by ITRS, has been shown in the Figs. 6.1 and 6.2. The reasons for the dimensions decrease are as follow: improvement of the part's quality and performance, improvement of reliability, decreasing the power loss, improving the output efficiency, and decreasing its price.",

In order to increase the speed, parasitic capacity and serial resistances must be minimized so that RC delay time decreases and the Clock Frequency increase. Increment of the contact resistance in electronic parts has been one of the main limitations of size decrement in the recent decades. Hence, using new materials in joints has been considered in order to fix the circuit quality and increase the speed. In order to do so, metal silicides have been used in the process of metallization of joints and local systems. Selection of metal silicides has of great importance due to these reasons: their low special resistance, their contact resistances are low against both kinds of silicon, their high thermal stability, and their processes are compatible with silicon standard technology.",

The studies of nano hybrid particles have provided important fundamental insights for new functional materials such as photonic catalyst, high performance electronic materials and so on. Therefore, a lot of studies have been carried out to prepare the organic/ inorganic hybrid particles. The quantum size effect has been widely studied for the microelectronic devices because of their recent trend of downsizing. In addition, several reports demonstrated that the quantum size effect resulted in the new properties and/or the improved properties. In general, the quantum size effect is expected for the nano-particles below 50 nm in many cases. However, there are difficulties in manipulation and handling of such nano-particles, mainly due to the agglomeration and the adhesion. Therefore, good handling method should be developed for the nano-materials with quantum size effect in many fields, such as electronics and so on. From this point of view, Ohno et al. [15] were proposed the nano-coating of functional materials on the nano-particles. They successfully prepared the TiO 2 -SiO 2 hybrid particles by the modified sol-gel process. However, the obtained hybrid particles were not core-shell materials with homogeneous coating, and they couldn't control the quantum size effect. Therefore, they attempt to prepare the core-shell TiO 2 -SiO 2 hybrid particles with homogeneous coating by LPD. LPD is well known as film deposition process, and some researchers applied the LPD method to prepare the TiO 2 -Polystyrene (PS) Latex hybrid particles.",

The degree of the blue shift of the band gap energy by the quantum size effect for the obtained particles was approximately 0.13 eV larger than that of the pure titania, because of the existence of the Ti-O-Si bond. If the Ti-O-Si bond effect was removed, the blue shift of the band gap energy for core-shell type TiO 2 -SiO 2 particles was nearly the same value as that of the reported values for the pure titania.

Then the poly-side WSi 2 was used for electrode gate of logic circuits LSI in mid 1980, due to its low resistance compared with MoSi 2 . Application of TiSi 2 due to its low resistance compared with WSi 2 and its low contact resistance with both types of silicon, and also it's high thermal stability goes back to early 1990. When the MOS parts' dimensions are minimized to 0.2 lm or less, the formation of TiSi 2 faces troubles. TiSi 2 has two structural phases: C49 and C54. The phase C54 is more sought to be used in these parts due to its lower special resistance and higher stability. The resistance of C49 has been reported between 60-80 lXcm and that of C54 between 15-20 lXcm. When the dimensions of the part decrease, the transition from C49 to C54 gets harder. The cause of this difficult transition is connected with low density of C54 nucleuses inside the C49 network. Since the transition of C49 phase to C54 is a process controlled by nuclear stage. On the Si lines, if the line thickness is less than the average distance between two nucleuses of C54, the formation of C54 phase will be dominated in single-manner development. This single-dimension development causes noncomplete transformation of C49 to C54 and increases the resistance. Decreasing the dimensions of the part leads to the decrease of the temperature in which TiSi 2 starts to form. One of the ways to prevent this is to develop C54-TiSi 2 in thin lines, and also making the Si amorphous with the signal ion. In another different approach, the application of slow-fusible like Nb, Mo, Ta, and W has been suggested to form C54-TiSi 2 .",

Regarding the technology based on Co, it seems that Co-SALICIDE has specifications like high formation temperature, oxygen impurities, high consumption of Si in forming silicide, formation of pores and inter-facial irregularities. High consumption of Si creates thick layers and creates problems in forming thin layers (less than 100 nm), so consumption of a suitable silicide free of all these problems will be necessary in manufacturing future parts.",

Therefore, the temperature formation of silicide must be low enough to keep the joint thin in under 100 nm CMOS technologies. NiSi has the lowest formation temperature among all the silicides, and the thermal stability interval is 350-750\u00b0C. For TiSi 2 , the thermal stability interval is very limited. Contact resistance of TiSi 2 is high before 800\u00b0C, due to the presence of C49 crystal phase. Between 850\u00b0C and 950\u00b0C it decreases due to the formation of phase with formation of C54. Above the 950\u00b0C, due to the accumulation of surface resistance, it increases. In the other words, the contact resistance of NiSi gets stable and minimized between 350\u00b0C and 750\u00b0C. The increase of resistance above 750\u00b0C is due to the fusion of phase from NiSi to NiSi 2 . Therefore, NiSi is thermally suitable for the technologies under 100 nm. In the other words, it must be kept in mind that the temperatures of processes after the formation of silicide must not exceed 750\u00b0C [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

The gas sensing characteristics are also measured. Based on the experimental results, it was observed that particle size of the powders is drastically milled down to about 10 nm after 24 h of high-energy milling.

New structural model for these non-equilibrium nanocrystalline xSnO 2 -(1-x)a-Fe 2 O 3 materials explains both the lattice expansion of these high energy mechanically alloyed powders as well as the charge neutrality in terms of additional oxygen dangling bonds at the nano-sized particle surfaces.

Many thick film metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors based on their resistive changes, such as SnO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 , have been commercially designed to detect toxic gases (e.g., CH 4 , CO, and NO 2 ). Nano-sized materials have been widely used to produce new semiconductor gas sensors, owing to the great surface activity provided by their enormous surface areas. Hence, they are expected to exhibit higher gas sensitivity. Being a promising gas sensing material, nano-sized a-Fe 2 O 3 powders have been prepared by various methods, including chemical co-precipitation, sol-gel process, metallo-organic deposition (MOD), and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). These methods are basically chemical processing techniques to build homogeneous structure on an extremely fine scale of a few nanometers from the molecular level. Tan et al. [38] used a different technique called the high-energy ball milling technique to obtain nano-sized a-Fe 2 O 3 -based powders as the sensing materials. In this technique, the decrease of the particle size into fine powders of a few nanometers arises from the high-energy impacts during the collisions. This method, which is also known as mechanical alloying, has recently been used to prepare nano-sized SnO 2 -(a-Fe 2 O 3 )-based powders with the grain size down to 8 nm for gas sensing. Such initially immiscible, mechanically alloyed SnO 2 -(a-Fe 2 O 3 ) materials are far from their equilibrium state. It is suggested that the content of Sn 4+ ions may play an important role in the gas sensitivity. However, the sensing mechanism in this SnO 2 -(a-Fe 2 O 3 ) system has not been well understood because of the lack of a complete understanding of the microstructure of the materials.",

The effect of thickness of the layer on thermal stability of NiSi in Ni/Pt/Si(100) system has been shown in Fig. 6 .9. In the sample A in temperature 840\u00b0C, the surface resistance is increased from 1.7 to 2.3 X Sq . Considering the XRD results, the increase in surface resistance is due to the formation of NiSi 2 . In the sample B, transition temperature happens at 80\u00b0C and in the sample C, it remains with the surface resistance even after 880\u00b0C. Therefore, we can understand that by decreasing the thickness in Ni/Pt/Si(100) system, thermal stability is increased.

Ti Capsulation also decreases the inter-layer oxides. Also the Ti cap increases regularity and thermal stability, and also decreases the leak in flow. Before annealing, Ti surface is covered with a TiO 2 oxide layer. During aniline at 500\u00b0C, two important things happen: First, Ti cap has more reaction with oxygen. Second, Ti atoms in cap penetrate into Ni layer, and accumulate in the common line of Ni/ Si.

SiO 2 cap layer also delays the surface resistance. For the capped samples, the surfaces get more irregular with increasing temperature. The arrows show areas not covered by silicide.

High consumption of silicon makes it more difficult to develop this layer in nanometer dimensions.

Strong interaction between metal films and electromagnetic wave occurs when the film thickness decreases to nanometer scale.

[59] measured the reflectivity and transmittivity of nano-copper films to electromagnetic wave in infrared region, by which their complex optical constant and permittivity, both the real and the imaginary parts are calculated. All these parameters are essentially dependent on the film thickness. This dependence should be considered in application of nano-copper film. The dependence of electromagnetic parameters on the characteristic size provides new possibilities for designing high performance electromagnetic functional materials and devices. The evolution of the film microstructure plays an important role in the size effect of nano-copper film on complex permittivity. Figure 6 .11 shows dependence of reflectivity (a), transmittivity (b) of nano-copper films on thickness in infrared region. Figure 6 .12 also shows dependence of complex optical constant real and imaginary parts of nano-copper films on thickness in infrared region. Tang et al. [60] reviewed studies on ultraviolet stimulated emission and lasing observed at room temperature from nano-structured ZnO thin films. The nanostructured ZnO thin films were grown on sapphire substrates using Laser-Molecular-Beam-Epitaxy (L-MBE). The thin film was consisted of regularly arrayed hexagonal nano-crystallite columns, whose facets form natural micro-cavities. These nano-crystallites confine the centre-of-mass motion of excitons. As a result of the quantum size effect, the oscillation strength of the excitons is largely Fig. 6 .11 Dependence of reflectivity (a), transmittivity (b) of nano-copper films on thickness in infrared region, reprinted with kind permission from Du [59] enhanced, which is favored to the radiate recombination of exciton at room temperature. Excited using the frequency-tripled output of a YAG laser, the nanostructured ZnO thin film showed strong ultraviolet lasing at room temperature with a threshold as low as 24 kW/cm 2 . At a moderate pumping intensity, the room temperature stimulated emission is associated with an exciton-exciton collision process. At higher pumping density, the excitons are dissociated, and the ultraviolet stimulated emission is dominated by an electron-hole plasma recombination process. Because of the large enhancement of oscillator strength of the excitons, the optical gain of the stimulated emission measured at room temperature reaches as high as 320 cm -1 , which is an order higher than that observed in bulk ZnO crystals. In comparison with the electron-hole plasma stimulated emission in most of commercial semiconductor lasers, the excitonic stimulated emission can be realized at relatively low external pumping density. The observation of excitonic lasing effect at room temperature might be valuable in realization of practical ultraviolet semiconductor laser devices. Compact short-wavelength semiconductor laser diodes (SLDs) present vast possibilities in many high-technology applications. For example, in the area of optical storage, the storage density is limited by the size of the diffraction spot which is proportional to the square of the laser wavelength. Hence, the availability of short-wavelength SLD means much greater density of data can be stored on a disc. Towards this end, InGaAlP-based yellow SLDs had been developed with wavelength as short as 650 nm. Since this achievement, there was no report of shorter wavelength SLDs until 1990, when the first demonstration of green-blue lasing actions in ZnSe-based heterostructures was reported, followed soon by the successful operation of ZnSe-based laser diode in 1991. However, practical shortwavelength SLDs are still not available because the lifetime problem. Recently, room temperature (RT) ultraviolet (UV) stimulated emissions and laser emissions have been reported in metal nitride systems as a result of the breakthrough in the growth of high-quality GaN-based heterostructures and successful development of p-type doping.",

Among most important catalysts one can name TiO 2 particles. These particles are coated on efficient substrates and exposed to ultraviolet light in particular pools. Energy gap of this semi-conductor is about 3 eV. Due to radiation of ultraviolet light, there develops an oxidizing property in electron, produced cavity, and the material. Due to oxidization, they are degraded to some harmless materials, such as H 2 O, CO 2 , and other inorganic materials. Some experiments suggest that a wastewater polluted with oil organic materials can be completely degraded after 7 days.

Electrical conductivity tests have been done on the coatings for investigation of the possible enhanced or inverse effects of addition QDs on properties of hard nanocomposite. The effects of some effective factors have been investigated and it has been shown that by adding QD nanoparticulates the electrical conductivity of layers is completely controllable without adverse effect on wear resistance. Figure 6 .15 shows the effect of different rotating speeds on the electrical conductivity of obtained layers. Density of different nanoparticulates will decrease significantly by increasing rotating speed. By increasing rotating speed, nanoparticulates will distribute far from each other. By increasing rotating speed, electrical resistivity completely obey a linear relation with respect to rotating speed. Electrical resistivity acts to some what different from previous relations however it remains also completely predictable. Its plot (Fig. 6.16 ) can be divided into three sections. First section is a completely slight linear increase follows by a severe linear increase in second section and the third section is like the first one. It is worthwhile mentioning here that due to difference in trends which observed in this plot these sets of experiments have been done three times and reproducibility of the results has been proved. It can be said that due to the effective share of QD nanoparticulates in electrical conductivity of obtained layers, the amount of them and bridging among them will cause the rapid increase in second section of the curve. After reaching a special level for presence of QD nanoparticulates and increasing their joining, the electrical conductivity will increase again with a slight slope, as it can be seen in third section of the curve.
