They should still be expected to contribute in other nonclinical ways.\na.Doctors with any well-recognized increased risk of harm (e.g., advanced age, immunocompromise) should be allowed to opt out of direct patient care due to their higher risk for a bad outcome if they contract COVID-19, but should be permitted to continue providing care if they choose.b.Other requests to opt out of direct patient care should be assessed on an individual basis. Such an assessment should include the merits of the request, the availability of physician resources, generalizability (i.e., could all other similar requests be accommodated), and to what degree this accommodation would increase the risk of colleagues who continue to provide direct care. Some arguments for special consideration may include compelling personal circumstance (e.g., single parent, sole care-giver) or unique professional skills/abilities (e.g., department head, director of emergency medical service [EMS]).3)In situations where PPE is in short-supply or unavailable, the relative strength of the duty to care may be significantly weakened. However, there are other ethical and professional obligations to balance, including our fiduciary relationship with our patients, the need for our specialized skills, and maintaining solidarity with our colleagues and other health care providers. Appropriate responses to a shortage of PPE should focus on institutional and government responsibilities, rather than the withdrawal of care to patients.4)The reciprocal responsibilities that institutions and governments have to emergency physicians working in a pandemic need to be clearly articulated and a firm commitment made to fulfilling them. These include:\na.Ensuring adequate PPE.b.Instituting clear policies and procedures in the event that PPE shortages occur (this should include prioritizing resources for high-risk areas and outlining acceptable alternatives to ideal PPE).c.Ensuring appropriate processes to prevent transmission of COVID-19 and provide care to front-line workers who need it.",
