            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), members within genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae, have a positive-strand RNA genome of 7,200 nucleotides covalently linked at the 5\u2032 end to the viral protein 3B (VPg) and is translated cap-independently by internal ribosomal entry into a polyprotein (VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D), which yields the 11 proteins through various independently functioning intermediates, upon cleavage by viral proteases [1]. HRVs were originally classified into two species, A and B, and approximately 100 serotypes [2\u20134]. Advances in molecular methods led to the characterization of the third HRV group, a genetically heterogeneous third species, HRV species C(HRV-C) [5, 6]. Identification of the specific strain in HRV disease has been difficult because the traditional serological method is insensitive, labor intensive, and cumbersome [7], which requires the isolation of HRV in susceptible cell cultures and neutralization tests against all 101 serotype-specific antisera [3].",

            "text": "PCR products may be analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis or by capillary electrophoresis. Figure 1 depicts a typical pattern obtained by gel electrophoresis, while Fig. 2 depicts a typical pattern obtained by capillary electrophoresis.\n\n\nSeparate the PCR products from the second run PCR by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualize by UV transillumination (see Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4939-1571-2_3 for detailed method).\nFor reactions containing the 5\u00d7 Green GoTaq\u2122 Reaction Buffer, load samples onto the gel directly after amplification.For reactions not containing any indicator dyes, add gel-loading dye (e.g., bromophenol blue) before loading on the gel.Please see Fig. 1 for a picture of a sample gel of nested-PCR products from nasal swabs collected from children with suspected lower respiratory tract infection.There are single bright bands at the 110 bp size location of the positive control (PC), lanes labeled S5, S10, S21, and S32, but no bands around the same location in the negative control (NC), S1, S3, and S9 lanes.\nCapillary electrophoresis using QIAxcel system (see\nNote\n10). The 96-well plates can be run directly in the QIAxcel\u00ae capillary electrophoresis system. Separation is performed in a capillary of a precast gel cartridge. Each sample is automatically loaded (according to voltage and time parameters) into an individual capillary and voltage is applied. As the molecules migrate through the capillary, they pass a detector that measures the fluorescent signal. A photomultiplier detector converts the emission signal into electronic data, which are then transferred to the computer for further processing using BioCalculator software. After processing, the data are displayed as an electropherogram and a gel image.\nThe 0.2-ml 12-tube strips containing QX Alignment Marker and QX Intensity Calibration Marker (if required) should fit loosely in the MARKER1 and MARKER2 position.QX Alignment Markers should be replaced every 15\u201320 runs or as needed.When not in use, the 12-tube strip containing QX Alignment Marker should be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. It should be equilibrated to operating temperature (20\u201325 \u00baC) and centrifuged briefly before use.If the QIAxcel gel cartridge is being used for the first time, intensity calibration should be performed (see\nNote\n11).Preparation of the gel cartridge:Add 10 ml QX Wash Buffer to both reservoirs of the QX Cartridge Stand (provided with the QIAxcel instrument) and cover with 3 ml mineral oil (supplied).Remove the QIAxcel gel cartridge from its packaging and carefully wipe off any soft gel debris from the capillary tips using a soft tissue.Remove the purge cap seal from the back of the QIAxcel gel cartridge and place it in the QX Cartridge Stand.Incubate new cartridges in the QX Cartridge Stand for 20 min prior to use.\nPreparing the buffer tray:Allow all reagents to equilibrate to room temperature (15\u201325 \u00b0C) before use.Wash the buffer tray with hot water and rinse thoroughly with deionized water.Fill the WP and WI positions of the buffer tray with 8 ml QX Wash Buffer.Fill the BUF position of the buffer tray with 18 ml QX Separation Buffer.Carefully add mineral oil to all three positions to prevent evaporation: add 2 ml mineral oil to positions WP and WI and 4 ml mineral oil to position BUF. All three positions should be covered with mineral oil.Insert the buffer tray into the buffer tray holder so that the slots for the 12-tube strips face the front of the instrument.\nPreparing QX Alignment Markers:Load 15 \u03bcl QX Alignment Marker into each well of a QX 0.2 ml 12-tube strip.Add one drop of mineral oil to each well, and insert the strip into the MARKER1 position of the buffer tray. Important: The 12-tube strip should fit loosely in the MARKER1 position on the buffer tray.\nInstalling a QIAxcel gel cartridge and smart key:Remove the QIAxcel gel cartridge from the QX Cartridge Stand; open the cartridge door and insert the QIAxcel gel cartridge into the QIAxcel system. The cartridge description label should face the front and the purge hole should face the back of the system.Insert the smart key into the smart key socket. The smart key can be inserted in either direction.Close the cartridge door. The cartridge ID, number of runs remaining, and cartridge type will be displayed automatically in the \u201cInstrument Control\u201d window once the smart key is latched. The system will not recognize the cartridge and will not operate if the smart key is not inserted.Add the DNA size marker (supplied with the kit) into the black well (see\nNote\n12).Load the 96-well plate containing the samples. The minimum sample volume required for analysis is 10 \u03bcl. Less than 0.1 \u03bcl of the sample will be loaded onto the QIAxcel gel cartridge for analysis. The remaining DNA can be kept for reanalysis or downstream processing.Results for nine nasal swab samples assayed by the Seeplex RV15 multiplex PCR products are shown in Fig. 2. According to the reference table provided by the manufacturer, samples 2 and 3 are probably positive for influenza A (a second specific PCR and/or sequencing of the PCR product needs to be performed to confirm), sample 5 is positive for HRV, and sample 9 is positive for CoV-OC43. The size of samples 2 and 3 is equal to influenza A, the size of sample 5 is equal to human rhinovirus A/B/C, and the size of sample 9 is equal to human coronavirus OC43. Samples 4, 6, 7, and 8 are negative for all the respiratory viruses detected by Seeplex assay.\n\n\n",

If desired, commercial VTM preparations can be used.The protocol described here has been optimized for the Roche MagnaPure LC 2.0 system; however, any comparable system for isolation of total RNA from clinical samples may be used, but may require modification of the protocol to optimize results.Any PCR equipment that is able to handle multiple samples in a 96-well format will be suitable.The clinical samples collected from patients with lower respiratory tract infection should be kept in 4 \u00b0C refrigerator and sent to microbiological laboratory within 8 h post-collection; If samples cannot be sent to laboratory within 8 h post-collection, they should be frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C.Appropriate personal protective equipment (laboratory coat, mask, gloves) should be worn at all times when handling human specimens.All clinical samples collected from patients with lower respiratory tract infection should be handled in a biological safety cabinet.When the number of samples to be analyzed is less than 10, it is quicker and more convenient to isolate the total RNA from samples manually by using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit. When the number of samples is more than 10, it is laborious and time consuming to isolate the total RNA from samples manually and an automated system, e.g., the Roche MagnaPure LC 2.0, may be used.Prepare the PCR pre-mix only in the pre-mix preparation room. Assay the first-strand cDNA synthesis and perform template DNA/RNA or cDNA pipetting in the template room. Do not apply the first-strand cDNA synthesis in the pre-mix preparation room to avoid contamination of the following PCR test. Ensure that the plates are covered and sealed with a membrane before they are transfered to PCR machine in the PCR amplification room.The 8-channel micropipette is preferred when using 96-well plates. It is less laborious and more accurate to aliquot reagent and pipet template DNA/RNA or cDNA into each well. Using multichannel micropipette also helps to reduce the contamination during PCR assay process.The QIAxcel system offers a number of advantages over traditional slab-gel electrophoresis, including higher detection sensitivity, less sample wastage (minimal sample input volumes), fast analysis of up to 96 samples, and automated loading and analysis, making it the preferred method for analysis of DNA products when large numbers of samples are processed.This step is not necessary if the QIAxcel gel cartridge has already been calibrated, unless it is being used on a different QIAxcel instrument or a different computer is used to operate the instrument. If a different computer is used, the calibration log file must be transferred from the computer used to operate the instrument to the new computer so that it is not necessary to run the calibration again.Once created, a single DNA reference marker table can be used for the entire life of the cartridge. However, variations in separation temperature of the cartridge and buffer can introduce variations in DNA size determination. For optimal results, we recommend creating a new DNA reference marker table every 8 runs or after each 96-well plate.\n",
