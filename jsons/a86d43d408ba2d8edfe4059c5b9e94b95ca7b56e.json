It is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and giant cell arteritis [5] . Recently, tocilizumab has become one of the therapeutic options for the management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [6] . CRS is the consequence of uncontrolled immune activation with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-1\uf062, IL-6, IL-18, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-10) [7] . Since a proportion of hospitalized patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 develop clinical and laboratory features reminiscent of CRS (including high fever, intense fatigue and myalgia, and elevated serum inflammatory markers Creactive protein, ferritin, and IL-6) [8, 9] , it was hypothesized that timely inhibition of inflammation with tocilizumab could be clinically effective for this population [10] . So far, the experience with tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients has been limited [11, 14] . Despite preliminary encouraging results, studies suffered from the lack of a standardized therapeutic scheme, a short post-treatment follow-up, and the absence of a comparison group. Here, we compare the outcomes at 28 days of a large cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab in addition to standard management, with those of concomitantly hospitalized patients who received standard management only.",

The rate of pulmonary thrombosis documented at contrast-enhanced thorax CT scan was also similar between the two groups: 2 (6%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared to 3 (9%) patients in the standard treatment group (p = 0.99). One patient per group developed a pneumothorax while on NIV. Transitory increase in serum AST or ALT was observed in 5 (15%) tocilizumab patients and in 6 (18%) standard treatment patients (p = 0.99). In the tocilizumab group the highest serum level of ALT was reached at a median time of 11 (9 -13) days. A transitory neutropenia was observed in 5 (16%) tocilizumab patients and no standard treatment patient (p = 0.024). In no patient the neutrophil count dropped < 1.000 10 9 cells/L. No infection developed in patients with transient neutropenia. No infusion-related adverse reaction was recorded.",

In the multivariate analysis performed in tocilizumab patients, only older age was associated with reduced survival, whereas a higher baseline PaO2:FiO2 ratio was associated with clinical improvement. These findings are in keeping with the previously published predictors of mortality in critically-ill COVID-19 patients [22, 23] .

In this study, four patients (13%) experienced bacterial infections after tocilizumab treatment; of these, three patients were in the ICU. As all ICU-admitted patients also received a second dose of tocilizumab, it is hard to discriminate whether ICU-level care (i.e. vascular catheters, invasive ventilation) or a higher tocilizumab dose could have played a role in the increased rate of infection observed in this population. Overall, the rate of infection was comparable in the standard treatment group, with 4 patients also experiencing blood-stream infections. In the tocilizumab group, three out of four patients with infectious adverse events were eventually discharged from hospital. Nonetheless, the occurrence of pulmonary aspergillosis and candidemia in one patient treated with high-dose tocilizumab and still hospitalized at the last time point raises a concern on opportunistic fungal infections in ICU patients treated with IL-6 blockers. Also the rate of pulmonary thrombosis, a recently recognized complication of severe COVID-19 [25] was not different between the two groups.",
