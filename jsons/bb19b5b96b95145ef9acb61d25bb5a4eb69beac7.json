Respirology 2008; 13: 257-262 Background and objective: To investigate the association between serological evidence of past infections with common respiratory pathogens and lung function in members of an isolated community of Aborigines from tropical coastal north-western Australia. Methods: FEV1 and FVC were assessed by dry bellows spirometer. Serum IgG titres to 11 common respiratory pathogens were assayed. Smoking history was assessed by questionnaire. Reciprocal positive IgG titres were taken as \u054610 for all pathogens with the exception of Legionella spp. (\u054640) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (\u054620). Linear regression analysis examined associations between titres and lung function after adjustment for age, height, gender and smoking, separately for adults (age > 17 years) and children. Results: An increased total number of positive IgG titres was significantly associated with reduced FEV1 (P = 0.01) and FEV1/FVC ratio (P = 0.01) suggesting the presence of airflow obstruction. This association was independent of age, gender, height, weight and smoking status. Conclusions: The burden of past respiratory infections may be an important determinant of airway function in this Aboriginal community.",

            "text": "Respiratory disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Australian Aboriginal people; agestandardized hospital admission rates for chronic obstructive airways disease in Western Australia between 1983 and 1993 were 4.5 and 8.8 times greater for Aboriginal men and women, respectively, compared with non-Aboriginal Western Australians. 1 Diseases of the respiratory system account for 12.2% of total hospital admissions for men and 8.7% for women. In 1991 the standardized mortality ratio for respiratory diseases was 5.2 for Indigenous men and 6.0 for Indigenous women. 2 Similar observations have been made in the Northern Territory of Australia and also indicate that this health disparity has not improved with time. 3 Studies of members of an isolated coastal Australian Aboriginal community in the tropical Kimberley region of Western Australia have shown that levels of lung function measured by FEV1 and FVC were lower than those of Australians of European descent. 4 The difference in these indices from age-and gendermatched Australians of European descent was as much as 20%, even in asymptomatic individuals. [4] [5] [6] [7] Airway hyper-responsiveness and the presence of respiratory symptoms were associated with lower levels of lung function, as was a history of 'asthma'. 4 The reduced levels of FEV1 and FVC relative to height occurred in both children and adults. 4 Therefore, reduced lung growth and/or a more rapid decline with age in adults may contribute to poor lung function. Cigarette smoking, poor nutrition, overcrowding and other adverse external conditions, including respiratory infections, may be responsible for these differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations. No evidence of Ig deficiency or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency has been shown; in fact Ig levels tend to be higher in Aboriginal people compared with non-Aboriginal Australians. 8 A number of studies have shown increased frequency of bacterial upper respiratory infections and lower respiratory infections in Australians of Aboriginal descent with Central Australian Aboriginal people having the highest rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, 9 as well as rates of Haemophilus influenzae infection. 10 However, there is no direct evidence concerning the potential contributions of viral and other respiratory infections to reduced lung function in Australian Aboriginal people.",

In a cross-sectional community study in Norway the level of serum respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibodies was associated with reduced FEV1, suggesting that RSV infection or re-infection was an independent predictor of reduced lung function in those adults. 11 Consistent with this observation, Hogg showed that potential latent adenovirus infection may be associated with the presence of COPD. 12 There is also evidence from experimental studies that latent adenovirus infection increases the inflammatory response to an acute exposure to cigarette smoke by increasing the numbers of macrophages and helper T cells in the airway epithelium. 13 The aim of the current study was to determine if there was an association between previous infection with common respiratory pathogens and lung function in a community-based sample of Indigenous Australians.",

The study does not indicate that any particular organism is likely to be more detrimental than any other; a positive titre to an organism does not indicate that it is more significant than any other. Viral respiratory infections are known to be associated with subsequent bacterial infection and exacerbations of COPD, 20 which may be an intermediate step in a process of accelerated rate of decline in lung function, leading to irreversible airflow obstruction. However, a role for exacerbations in causing accelerated decline in other populations has not been consistently observed, 21 and excessive rates of decline in lung function have not been directly demonstrated in Aboriginal people in remote communities, although it is the subject of ongoing investigation in the community in which the present study was carried out. The previous demonstration of possible latent adenovirus infection in subjects with COPD 12 is consistent with a direct effect of viral infections on the airways, but also consistent with abnormal airways such as may result from cigarette smoking giving rise to increased susceptibility to infection with viruses and other respiratory pathogens. Additionally, Vitalis et al. 13 showed that latent adenovirus-5 infection increased the inflammatory cell response to an acute exposure to cigarette smoke in guinea pig lungs, increasing the number of macrophages and helper T cells in the airway epithelium. Recruitment of CD8 + lymphocytes in response to viral infections may cause pulmonary damage as suggested by O'Shaughnessy et al. 22 and Cannon et al. 23 Fryer and Jacoby 24 suggested that viral infections may decrease M2 muscarinic receptor function in airways, thereby increasing vagally mediated bronchoconstriction; the duration of this effect for acute viral infection is not known. Viral infection with rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza A and B, RSV and parainfluenza virus and infection with chlamydia have all been associated with exacerbations of asthma. 25 Serology for H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus was not performed in this study, nor was sputum culture available in this remote community, so that the effect of these organisms was not assessed as an a priori decision. The pathogens were selected because they are more likely to be primary pathogens.",

However, it is likely that environmental factors are as important. 27 The prevalence of diagnosed asthma, and to a lesser extent allergy to aeroallergens, is low in Aboriginal communities, 1,4 although 'asthma' admission rates are higher than for non-Aboriginal people. 28 It has long been recognized that chronic respiratory disease is common in Aboriginal communities. 1, 5 There is a high prevalence of bacterial infection of the sputum and invasive pneumococcal disease. 29, 30 The present study suggests that repeated episodes of respiratory infection with common respiratory viral pathogens may be directly or indirectly associated with impaired lung growth in childhood and/or excessive loss of lung function in adulthood. Therefore, in addition to smoking control, targeted public health measures such as vaccination, early pharmacological (anti-biotic) intervention for (superimposed) bacterial infection, or efforts to reduce rates of transmission by the provision of better housing or nutrition could all result in reduced morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease in these people.",
