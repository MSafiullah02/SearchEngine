In many ways, the Chinese experience has become a template for Covid-19 control. The key (and to date only) method established to combat Covid-19 is prevention. The Chinese used vigorous case identification, along with tracking of contacts and isolation of sources of infection, to limit spread and eventually allow cautious resumption of activities. While one can argue about the precise details of the Chinese approach and its effectiveness, one must not ignore it and the many lessons that can be learned. China and other countries like South Korea that effectively controlled Covid-19 relied heavily on extensive screening followed by careful isolation/tracking of cases and contacts. Since effective broadscale vaccination is likely 12-18 months away, the only way that the public can be protected, while avoiding economic ruin, is to enforce strict public health measures. Any society that attempts to reopen economic activity without careful public health controls risks seeing rapid reactivation of widespread infection and death.",

Vervoort et al emphasize the critical importance of prompt and open dissemination of information about Covid-19, its consequences and management.6 Our publisher, Elsevier, is contributing to this effort by facilitating rapid electronic publication of Covid-19 related papers, along with their collection in a freely-available open-access repository (https://www.onlinecjc.ca/covid-19). Cardinal et al provide preliminary evidence that the use of fetal echocardiography to screen for congenital malformations can be reduced greatly for patients with a normal 2nd trimester scan, without missing severe congenital heart disease.7 Marenzi et al share their experience dealing with tertiary in-hospital management of acute coronary syndromes in the hard-hit Lombardy region of Italy, without units dedicated to isolation of Covid-19 patients.8 While the optimum is clearly to have all Covid-positive patients hospitalized in individual negative-pressure rooms geographically distinct from Covid-free subjects, this is often not possible under real-world conditions. Thadathilankal et al provide a commentary9 that takes issue with prior comments by Bombardini et al,10 emphasizing the complexity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) system balance that governs the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the most common major complication of Covid-19. Peng et al report cardiac-rhythm complications in Covid-19 patients,11 reminding us that Covid-19 can produce serious cardiac complications.5 Finally, Babu et al provide discuss approaches to maintaining cardiac rehabilitation services despite social distancing and limited institutional access.12 Their suggestions for more effective use of technologically-driven remote rehabilitation may prove valuable outside the pandemic in underserviced areas of challenging environments like rural Canada.13\n",
