In addition to the peracute disease course, resulting in death, most cases are characterized by a red\u2010brownish diarrhoea, sometimes containing blood. This is accompanied by a hemorrhagic to hemorrhagic necrotizing inflammation of the middle and posterior sections of the small intestine. In view of the high morbidity and mortality rates, NE is a cause of serious financial losses in pig rearing.",

At the same time, it causes disturbances in the terminal vascular system in the region of the villous vessels. The presence of \u03b2\u2010toxins can be demonstrated in the mesenterial lymph nodes by this time, indicating that absorption takes place at an early stage [6]. The action of the toxins on the enterocytes culminates in their necrosis. With the epithelium exposed, the clostridia are now in a position to attach themselves to the villous stroma, i.e. to the basal membrane. Here, they rapidly bring about massive necrosis of the mucosa and submucosa, together with destruction of the villous vessels, causing leakage of erythrocytes into the lumen of the bowels. The level of \u03b2\u2010toxin in the blood rises massively, resulting in enterotoxemia.",

Once the disease was confirmed by pathological/anatomical and microbiological findings, the piglets of groups 187/188 were given 40 000 IU of benzylpenicillin potassium in the first 3 days post partum [[4], [11]]. Administration of the penicillin shifted the peak of piglet losses from the first days post partum to the second week after birth. There was no reduction in the actual number of losses. The sows of groups 190, 191 and 192 were additionally vaccinated twice with the Per\u2010C\u2010porc\u00ae.
