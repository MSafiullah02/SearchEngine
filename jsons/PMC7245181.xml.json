On December 31, 2019, this new infection was reported to the World Health Organization 31, 2019 (CNN 2020). By January 7, 2020, genetic analysis of viral isolates from affected patients indicated that the etiologic agent was a novel coronavirus distinct from those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). By January 16, 2020, it is recognized in Japan in a Japanese man who had travelled to Wuhan (CNN 2020). From the time of its appearance in December 2019, this novel coronavirus spread a lightening-like speed through the world\u2019s population. As of March 29, 2020, the illness referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized in 172 of the world\u2019s 192 countries (Organization WH 2020). The total number of confirmed cases was 634,835, and the number of deaths attributed to the disease was 29,957 (Organization WH 2020) and rapidly rising.",

The nucleocapsid demonstrates a helical symmetry. By electron microscopy, coronaviruses display spike peptomer projections measuring 20 nm in length that are responsible for the virus\u2019 tropism. It is the \u201ccrown-like\u201d appearance of these projections that gave rise to the name coronavirus. Coronaviruses have four main structural proteins: spike (S)-protein, membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)-proteins that are all encoded with in the 3\u2032 end of the virus (Fehr and Perlman 2015). The spike protein is a trimeric fusion protein that mediates attachment to the host receptor. The membrane protein is the most abundant structural protein in the virion. The envelope protein facilitates assembly and release of the virus, and the ion channel activity in SARS-CoV envelope protein is required for pathogenesis. The N-protein constitutes the only protein present in the nucleocapsid. It is composed of 2 domains that bind RNA (Fehr and Perlman 2015). The hemagglutinin-esterase protein is present in a subset of \u03b2-coronaviruses and binds sialic acids on surface glycoproteins and contains acetyl-esterase activity (Li 2016).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Coronaviruses in the beta genus include SARS, MERS, and the new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-Cov-2. There are now at least six human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HcoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL-63, and HCoV-HKU1 (Arabi et al. 2015). SARS-CoV-2 was named for its close genetic relationship to the SARS virus. The \u201cspike proteins\u201d of both SARS (Imai et al. 2010) and SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al. 2020) use the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor type 2 (ACE-2) to bind to cells. The ACE-2 receptor is widely distributed in the body present in the lungs, oral and nasal mucosa, bone marrow and spleen, skin, heart, arteries, kidneys, adipose tissue, reproductive system, and brain (Hamming et al. 2004). ACE 2 receptor is also expressed in the central nervous system predominantly in thalamic nuclei, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nuclei (Allen et al. 2009). The location of these receptors in the brain may be of relevance with respect to coronavirus encephalitis. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29,903 bases long, and estimates of viral evolution suggest that it arose no earlier than the end of October 2019. A 96% homology with bat coronavirus indicates that it originated as a bat virus with an intermediate host in another animal (Chan et al. 2020). Two different strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified: an S-strain which is evolutionary older and less aggressive and an L-strain which is more aggressive and spreads more quickly (Tang et al. 2020). The L-strain is more prevalent (70%) than the S-strain (30%) (Tang et al. 2020).",

In those becoming symptomatic, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are virtually indistinguishable from influenza. It is initially characterized by fever in up to 90% and cough in approximately 50% (Guan et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020b; Tian et al. 2020) with symptoms developing after a median incubation period of 4\u20136.7 days (Tian et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020a). Myalgia and fatigue are seen in about 50% (Huang et al. 2020). Anosmia has been a common early symptom (Hopkins and Kumar 2020). Headache has been reported in less than 10% (Tian et al. 2020). Acute myocarditis has been observed in as many as 12% (Huang et al. 2020), and gastroenteritis and diarrhea are seen in about 5% (Guan et al. 2020). On chest CT scan, the most common abnormality was ground glass opacities seen in about 75% (Pan et al. 2020). Most patients are diagnosed with pneumonia. Older patients have more severe disease. In one study from China, mechanical ventilation was required in 6.1% of patients (Guan et al. 2020), though rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome as high as 29% have been reported. A study of 262 confirmed cases revealed that 17.6% had severe disease, whereas 73.3% were assessed as mild, 4.2% non-pneumonic, and 5.0% asymptomatic (Tian et al. 2020), though it is believed that widespread testing would reveal far higher numbers of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic persons. Lymphopenia is commonly observed (Huang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020c), and severe lymphopenia may be associated with a higher mortality (Tan et al. 2020). Acute phase reactants are elevated including a variety of cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, IL6, and IL10 (Wang et al. 2020b; Huang et al. 2020). Case fatalities rates have varied by country with the highest reported in Bangladesh at 11.36% and the lowest in Israel at 0.30% (Oke and Heneghan 2020). Mortality is higher with advanced age and underlying comorbidities (Wang et al. 2020c; Yang et al. 2020) including cardiac and respiratory disorders and immunosuppressed states. Children typically have milder disease, and death in children has been rare (Ludvigsson 2020).",

Markers of coagulation may be increased during infection (Zhou et al. 2020), and disseminated intravascular coagulation has been observed (Tang et al. 2020). A viral myocarditis (Madjid et al. 2020) may increase the risk of stroke. Lastly, brain endothelial express ACE-2 receptor and the potential exists for viral-induced vasculitis. Risk may be increased for both arterial and venous cerebrovascular disease. In one recent series of 78 COVID-19 patients, stroke occurred in 6 (2.8%) (5 ischemic and 1 hemorrhagic) (Mao et al. 2020). In a small series of 24 patients from the Seattle region, stroke was observed in 2 (8%) of 24 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Bhatraju et al. 2020).",

Anosmia has been reported in up to 30 to 66% and may be an early symptom of infection (Hopkins and Kumar 2020). Anecdotally, in mild infection, it may be the only clue of infection. Anosmia is often accompanied by ageusia (Guan et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020). Anosmia and ageusia related to COVID-19 typically resolve over several weeks. Anosmia did not appear to be a commonly reported manifestation during the SARS epidemic as there is but one published case report (Hwang 2006).

ADEM has been described with the human coronavirus OC43 infection in a 15-year-old boy with the history of a URI the week before the development of the heralding manifestation of lower extremity numbness (Yeh et al. 2004). HCoV-OC43 was detected by PCR in CSF and nasopharyngeal secretions as well as rising antibody titers to the virus (Yeh et al. 2004). To date, there are no classic cases of ADEM described in association with SARS-CoV-2; however, a 66-year-old critically ill man developed an acute thoracic myelitis at the height of illness with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Zhao et al. 2020). Although described as post-infectious in nature, the possibility of an acute myelitis secondary to viral invasion was considered by the authors who discuss the expression of the ACE-2 receptor on spinal cord neuron membranes (Zhao et al. 2020).",

Whether the headache is the consequence of viral invasion remains uncertain. Myalgias are also common and may be accompanied by an increase in muscle enzymes suggestive of a myositis, but severe rhabdomyolysis remains rare. Stroke has occurred in a small percentage of patients and likely results from multiple underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Although encephalopathy is seen with severe illness, it may be explained by the accompanying metabolic abnormalities attending a cytokine storm rather than occurring from viral invasion of the brain, though rare cases of the latter seem to occur. As with other viral infections, a small number of patients are likely to experience autoimmune neurological disease, specifically AIDP and ADEM, in the wake of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
