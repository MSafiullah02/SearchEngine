No typical signs of meningitis were observed in our patient in CSF, clinically and by radiological diagnostics, yet this is not obligatory. Thus, it could also be that the acute injuries resulted from the fact that the patient was weakened by the HBoV associated pneumonia rather than a direct involvement of HBoV in the neurological disorder. Nevertheless, there is a high chance that the active and serious pneumonia that in fact was deduced to the HBoV mono-infection was linked to the neurological symptoms directly or indirectly, and thus the case strongly supports the request for further cohort studies that systematically and controlled address the question if a correlation between the HBoV infection and neurological disorders exists.20 Especially the fact that the patient had an underlying neurological disease gives raise to the hypothesis that those patients are more likely affected of injuries as the HBoV infection could weaken the patient and lead to a loss of body control. Most recently, a further atypical case of HBoV infection was observed that was associated with encephalopathy,21 thus further confirming that at the present stage neurological side effects of respiratory HBoV infections cannot be excluded, although the causative relation has to be further investigated. Unfortunately, no CSF fluid was left for further analyses, and that is exactly why this case is extremely important. Especially in adult patients, several rare but possible etiologies are not routinely tested such as HBoV and human metapneumovirus, although these pathogens were previously shown to be associated with a distinct clinical entity. Thus, this case is an alarm signal and reminder to test also for HBoV in case of unclear neurological symptoms. In view of the recent literature and taking into account the fact that HBoV was detected in BAL and serum, it is the most likely explanation for the acute neurological exacerbation, although it could also be a simple co-incidence.",
