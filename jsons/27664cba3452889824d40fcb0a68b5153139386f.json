Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported in Italy. Furthermore, these deaths may be missing from official records describing COVID-19 patients. We also found evidence of worsening hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.",

Mexico is a middle-income country that saw its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on February 27 th , and reached 10,000 cases by April 17 th , according to official statistics 18 . Tijuana, in Northern Mexico, is a city of over 1.7 million inhabitants that shares a heavily crossed border with San Diego County, California, in the United States 19 . As of May 12 th , the international border remained open to residents of the United States, although Mexican nationals with tourist visas were generally barred from crossing beginning in late March. Tijuana therefore may have been subjected to earlier exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than the rest of Mexico due to the importation of cases from California 20, 21 . Reported cases of COVID-19 in Tijuana were among the first in Mexicobeginning on March 17 th . On May 11th Tijuana had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths of any municipality in the country (170), and the mortality rate (17.3 per 100,000 people) was almost six times the national rate of 3.1 per 100,000 people 18, 19, 22 .

Using OLS regression we modelled the seasonal time trend with a fixed effect dummy variable on each week of the year. The secular trend was captured using a linear continuous fixed effect on year. Forecasts with 95% prediction intervals were made by extrapolating the model through May 2020. Ratios of observed to expected numbers and proportions, and their uncertainty intervals were calculated by divided the observed value in each week by the forecasted value and prediction interval. We compared pre-epidemic SpO2 values with those seen during the peak epidemic period.

Nevertheless, the remaining quintiles of the distribution generally decreased in their SpO2 values, and a widening of the distribution of SpO2 was observed as a result. In the week of April 7 th , the lowest quintile of the distribution of SpO2 values fell sharply, reaching a median SpO2 of 55%. Notably, despite the lower average SpO2, the proportion of patients presenting as alert and oriented did not see a commensurate drop relative to baseline (table 2), even among the lowest quintile of SpO2 values (Figure 3 ). Figure 5 highlights the SES and geospatial distribution of out-of-hospital mortality and respiratory cases in Tijuana. It is noteworthy that the largest clusters of out-of-hospital mortality did not occur in the same locations as the largest clusters of respiratory cases. We observe that clusters of respiratory cases during the peak epidemic period were most concentrated in highest-and high-SES quintiles of Tijuana. Contrastingly, the largest clusters of out-of-hospital mortality cases were seen in the low-SES quintile. As rates per 100,000 people the low-SES quintile of the population saw the highest rate of out-of-hospital mortality at 24.5, while the high-SES quintile saw the highest rate of respiratory cases, at 30.9.",

For example, increased cardiac arrest frequency could arise if patients stayed home during ischemic chest pain episodes, because the system was saturated, or they were afraid to seek care. Although we did examine the diagnostic codes associated with each death, the EMTs completing the records were unable to reliably ascertain the cause of death in the majority of cases, and information about prior COVID-19 tests was typically not available. Similarly, our measure of respiratory cases only reflects SpO2 values below 92%, or other respiratory symptoms, and cannot directly indicate patient COVID-19 status. Like any analysis using EMS data, the out-of-hospital mortality statistics presented here cannot capture events occurring in the absence of 9-1-1 activations. Though we note a large increase in out-of-hospital mortality, our results may not represent the full in increase in absolute numbers. However, if the proportion of deaths resulting in 9-1-1 activations were to be correlated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, that could bias our results in an unpredictable direction.",

Additionally, the model we used to extrapolate past trends into 2020 was straightforward in design, and we did not perform out-of-sample predictive validity testing or compare alternative predictive model forms. Nevertheless, given the magnitude of the disparities observed, and the presence of some missing data in past years of observed trends, we opted for a simple and easy-tointerpret model.

Out-of-hospital mortality documented by the EMS system increased dramatically during the peak observed COVID-19 epidemic period seen in April 2020. The relative excess mortality-145% above baseline-represents between a two and-threefold higher magnitude increase compared to the 58% figure reported in a recent study from the Lombardy region of Italy 1 . This may be related to Tijuana being in a middle-income country, with a relatively more fragile healthcare system and lower-income population. These results suggest that other regions of Mexico, and LMICs in general, may need to plan for and ameliorate sharply increasing rates of out-ofhospital mortality in order to prevent a large burden of potentially unmeasured death stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings echo a growing number of calls for health system strengthening in LMIC in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic 2-6 .",

This suggests that the increase in out-of-hospital mortality that we observed cannot be explained by official COVID-19 statistics. Importantly, we were not able to ascertain the etiology of the excess mortality we observe. It is therefore possible that most of the excess deaths resulted from non-COVID-19 causes of death, stemming from delay of care or health system saturation. It is also possible that many of the deaths we observe represent COVID-19 patients who were never diagnosed or formally tracked as such. Finally, delays in reporting or data presentation may simply have led to lower weekly totals for out-of-hospital mortality among known COVID-19 patients who are not hospitalized. In any case, EMS data represent an important source of near-real-time information that can be used to rapidly track the evolving health of COVID-19 affected populations. We propose that EMS systems may play an especially important sentinel role in LMICs, and can be used to monitor excess out-of-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 crisis.",

However, the number of EMS-documented out-of-hospital deaths and total respiratory cases did not show a corresponding decrease. More research is required to explore what role access to COVID-19 tests, or access to hospital beds, may be playing in driving differences between EMS-documented, and official statistics. Although EMS staff were not able to generate substantial clinical information about patients who died before reaching a hospital, as most were found dead-on-arrival, important clues about the etiology of out-of-hospital mortality can be gleaned by assessing clinical and demographic characteristics among living patients seen for respiratory symptoms during the same period. During the window of observed peak excess mortality, we also observed a concurrent elevation in the rate of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. These patients had similar demographic characteristics to the out-of-hospital mortality cases. Although the number of respiratory patients reached the highest rate observed during the 2014-2020 period studied, they were still lower than the number of official COVID-19 patients that were hospitalized. This suggests that most officially documented COVID-19 patients are reaching healthcare facilities independently of the EMS system in Tijuana.",

As COVID-19 quickly overwhelms frail health-systems, clinicians on the frontlines may easily overlook a \"well appearing\" patient despite a low SpO2, to make room for patients who are overtly sick. It is important for patients to understand that in silent hypoxemia, dyspnea is a late-stage symptom, and their condition may be deteriorating without perceived decreases in subjective respiratory ability 14 . Detection of hypoxemia in the general population should be undertaken, and priority areas can be identified using clusters from EMS data, such as those shown in Figure 5 of this text. For resourcelimited settings, a potential screening tool can be found in the ROTH scale proposed by Chorin et al. 30 It is a simple breathing and counting exercise that has been shown to have a positive correlation with measured SpO2. It was originally conceived as a tool for telemedicine, and has not been validated in patients with COVID. However, in resource-limited settings, it may also be administered in-person in lieu of a pulse-oximeter or via phone. To facilitate it's calculation, a free open access website application was created in Spanish on April 30 th , 2020 (https://pruebaroth.com/) 31 . The scale is imperfect and it will require validation among COVID-19 patients to be used widely; however, it may provide some triage benefit in settings where wide-scale measurement using pulse oximetry is not feasible.",

We observed a differential trend by neighborhood-SES between out-of-hospital mortality and respiratory cases. Although respiratory cases were strikingly concentrated in the high-and highest-SES quintiles, the highest out-of-hospital mortality rates were observed in low-SES areas. There is a notable difference between respiratory cases and deaths, which may suggest that the profile of individuals who have the economic or social capital to seek care early for respiratory symptoms in Tijuana differs from those who do not interact with the medical system until after their death. This finding adds to a growing body of literature and social commentary suggesting that social inequalities may be translating into inequalities in the risk of infection or death from COVID-19 in numerous contexts [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Conclusions EMS data provide a valuable tool to rapidly track the health of populations at risk of COVID-19, and can be used to track excess out-of-hospital mortality and respiratory burden, as well as changing clinical or demographic features. Detected clusters of out-of-hospital mortality or cases can be subsequently targeted for screenings for hypoxemia and/or COVID-19 status.

Overlaid is the out-of-hospital mortality occurring during April 14 th to May 11 th (part A) and respiratory cases occurring during March 31 st to May 11 th (part B). The number of cases in each neighborhood (colonia) is shown as a point, with the size reflecting the magnitude. In the middle column, the points are organized by neighborhood SES. On the right, the number of cases is shown as a rate per 100,000 people, for each quintile of neighborhood SES.",
