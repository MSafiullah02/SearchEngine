This is especially true for viral diseases that are easily and readily transmissible and have asymptomatic infectivity periods. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) described in December 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in major quarantines to prevent further spread, including major cities, villages, and public areas throughout China and across the globe.1\u20133 As of February 25, 2020, the World Health Organization\u2019s situational data indicate ~77,780 confirmed cases in 25 countries, including 2,666 deaths due to COVID-19.4 Most deaths reported so far have been in China.5 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization have issued interim guidelines to protect the population and to attempt to prevent the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from infected individuals.6 Cities and villages throughout China are unable to accommodate such large numbers of infected individuals while maintaining the quarantine, and several new hospitals have been built to manage the infected individuals.7 It is imperative that we evaluate novel models to attempt to control the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2.8 Technology can assist in faster identification of possible cases to yield more timely interventions.",

Such data can be used in the preliminary screening and early identification of possible COVID-19 cases. Thousands of data points can be processed through an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can evaluate individuals and stratify them into no risk, minimal risk, moderate risk, and high risk groups. The high-risk cases identified can then be quarantined earlier, thus decreasing the chance of spreading the virus (Table 1).",

These procedures are explained in steps 3 and 4 in Appendix 2. The extended analysis we propose can help determine any association among sociodemographic variables and the signs and symptoms, such as fever and lower respiratory infection including cough and shortness of breath, in individuals with and without possible infection.
