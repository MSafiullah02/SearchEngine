            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory illness that has recently been reported in Asia, North America, and Europe (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the cumulative number of probable cases of SARS between 16 November 2002 and 7 August 2003 was 8422 with 916 deaths, just over a 10% death rate (World Health Organization, 2003). Coronaviruses [Order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, Genus Coronavirus (Gonzalez et al., 2003)] are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment or the cis-Golgi network (Klumperman et al., 1994, Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994, Tooze et al., 1984). The coronavirus envelope characteristically contains two major viral structural proteins, the spike (S) glycoprotein (for review, see Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) and the membrane (M) glycoprotein. A third minor but important membrane protein is the envelope (E) protein (Siddell, 1995a). E protein is a small, 9\u201312 kDa integral membrane protein (Siddell, 1995b). The N-terminus consists of a short 7\u20139 amino acid hydrophilic region and a 21\u201329 amino acid hydrophobic region, followed by a hydrophilic C-terminal region (Shen et al., 2003). E proteins play a part in viral assembly and morphogenesis. Co-expression of E and M proteins, from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Bos et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1996), transmittable gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Baudoux et al., 1998), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Corse and Machamer, 2000), and SARS-CoV (Ho et al., 2004) results in nucleocapsid independent formation of virus-like particles (VLPs). Additionally, MHV and IBV E protein expressed alone results in assembly of E-protein-containing vesicles, with a density similar to that of VLPs (Corse and Machamer, 2000, Maeda et al., 1999). Further evidence of E protein's important role in virus assembly and morphogenesis is that MHV E gene mutants have aberrant morphology with pinched and elongated shapes (Fischer et al., 1998). Recently, MHV recombinant virus was constructed with the entire E gene deleted. The virus was able to replicate to low titer and had a small plaque phenotype, indicating that E protein although important, is not essential for MHV replication in vitro (Kuo and Masters, 2003, Shen et al., 2003). In contrast, E protein expression is essential for TGEV replication, as deletion of the TGEV E protein is lethal and replication of the mutant virus can be rescued by TGEV E protein expressed in trans (Ortego et al., 2002).",

Based on similarities to other virus ion channels, we hypothesized that the SARS-CoV E protein might form ion channels.

Initial experiments were done with 500 mM NaCl in the CIS chamber and 50 mM NaCl in the TRANS chamber. Small aliquots of the peptides dissolved in TFE were added to the CIS chamber while stirring to facilitate collision between peptide and bilayer. Spontaneous insertion of ion channel forming peptides into bilayers from TFE solution has been demonstrated previously with a number of small hydrophobic peptides (Ewart et al., 1996, Griffin et al., 2003, Melton et al., 2002, Pavlovic et al., 2003, Premkumar et al., 2004, Schubert et al., 1996b, Sunstrom et al., 1996). In general, ion currents due to SARS-CoV E protein were observed about 5\u201315 min after peptide was added to the CIS chamber in over 60 experiments. Initiation of channel activity was detected more rapidly and reliably when a holding potential of approximately \u2212100 mV was applied across the bilayer, suggesting that peptide insertion into the bilayer was facilitated by a negative potential (TRANS relative to CIS).",

Fig. 3A shows typical current traces of full-length E protein ion channel, recorded over a range of holding potentials, showing that the current\u2013voltage (IV) relationship is not linear with conductance being relatively larger at more negative holding potentials (Fig. 3B). If the IV curve is linear, the channel has a constant conductance equal to the slope of the line. Some channels have conductances that vary with voltage and the IV is therefore nonlinear, the channel has larger current at higher potentials. The currents we measure are normally aggregated currents from a number of ion channels and the current amplitude (I) is given by NP\no \u00d7 gamma(V\nm \u2212 V\nr), where N is the total number of channels in the bilayer, P\no is the average open probability of these channels, gamma is single channel conductance, V\nm is the potential applied across the bilayer membrane, and V\nr is the potential at which currents reverse direction. As seen with other ion channels, it is not unlikely that P\no may be potential-dependent and this would give the nonlinear IV curves we see. Note, however, that the reversal potential is not affected by the voltage dependence of P\no.",

The mean reversal potentials (V\nr) for currents formed by the full-length and N-terminal peptides measured in NaCl solutions were not significantly different from each other (see Table 1), nor were the V\nr measured in KCl solutions significantly different. However, for both peptides, comparison of the V\nr measured in KCl with that measured in NaCl solutions revealed a significant difference (P < 0.003). The ion selectivity series for both peptides was Na+ > K+ > Cl\u2212 with the channels being approximately 5\u201310 fold more permeable to Na+ than K+ and approximately 10-fold more permeable to K+ than Cl\u2212.

These were mainly apparent below an m/z ratio of approximately 6000. Therefore, it was important to show that channel formation was specific to the full-length peptide and not the contaminants. To achieve this, we synthesized a third peptide corresponding to the first 19 N-terminal amino acids of the SARS E protein and used it to raise and purify polyclonal antibodies recognizing this domain (see Materials and methods). Previous results with other ion-channel-forming proteins have shown that such epitope-specific antibodies can inhibit channel activity, or be used to selectively remove the channel-forming species from preparations (Ewart et al., 1996, Melton et al., 2002, Sunstrom et al., 1996).",

The aggregates were not disrupted by addition of reducing agent, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, nor were they significantly affected by boiling or not boiling the samples prior to PAGE (not shown). In the blot shown in Fig. 4, relatively large quantities of peptide were loaded per lane and the smallest bands detected (presumably monomeric peptide molecules) ran just above or below the 11 kDa marker for the full-length and N-terminal peptides, respectively. The observation that these putative monomers do not run at their theoretical molecular weights is not an unusual phenomenon for small hydrophobic peptides, where it is thought that the uniform binding of SDS may be affected, altering the relative rate of migration through polyacrylamide gels. For example, chemically cross-linked homo-oligomers of the HIV-1 protein Vpu do not run at their calculated molecular weights (Maldarelli et al., 1993). Importantly, the Western blots did not show any immunoreaction with lower molecular weight bands that might correlate to truncated peptides or contaminating species. By this criterion, the purified antibody was judged to be a specific reagent for binding to the N-terminal epitope of full-length and N-terminal peptides. Further, the anti-N-terminal antibody did not cross-react with a nonspecific protein antigen, such as the hepatitis C (HCV) p7 protein (Fig. 4, lanes 3).",

Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV E protein specifically block the ion channel activity, supporting our conclusion that the ion channel activity is due to the SARS-CoV E protein and not to minor contaminants in the preparations. Addition of the anti-N-terminal antibody to the CIS chamber reduced average bilayer current generated by the SARS-CoV E protein by 73% \u00b1 16 (1 SEM), whereas addition of the anti-N-terminal antibody to the TRANS chamber did not significantly reduce conductance. As well as confirming specificity, this result indicates that the N-terminus faces into the CIS chamber. With the exception of HCV p7, the viral ion channels are generally thought to span the bilayer once, as a single alpha helix, so it is tempting to assume that the C-terminus would be located in the TRANS chamber. However, very recently, evidence was presented that the SARS-CoV E protein transmembrane domain can form a palindromic transmembrane helical hairpin and incorporation of the helical hairpin into lipid vesicles increased membrane curvature by deforming lipid bilayers (Arbely et al., 2004), a known function of viral ion channel family proteins (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). Clearly, if the SARS-CoV E protein forms such a helical hairpin under the conditions of our bilayer experiments, both the N- and C-termini would be located in the CIS chamber. From energetic considerations, it would seem that incorporation of a helical hairpin into lipid bilayers would be favored over the alternative, which requires a large number of hydrophilic amino acid residues to cross the bilayer into the TRANS chamber. Unfortunately, an antibody was not available to us with which to orient the C-terminus.",

Therefore, the C-terminal of the SARS-CoV E protein is not essential for ion channel conductance. It has also been shown that the Vpu C-terminal hydrophilic domain does not participate in ion channel conductance, and is not essential for regulation of virus release, although the presence of the cytoplasmic domain improves the function of Vpu, indicating that it may have a regulatory role (Schubert et al., 1996a, Schubert et al., 1996b). Likewise, it is possible that the C-terminal of coronavirus E proteins may have regulatory roles. Supporting this idea, site-directed mutations to a cluster of charged amino acids in the C-terminal of MHV E protein have been found to impair viral assembly and maturation (Fischer et al., 1998).",

Evidence suggests that Vpu plays a passive role in enhancement of viral budding, perhaps through generalized affects on the cellular environment, indirectly enhancing Gag trafficking to the plasma membrane (Deora et al., 2000, Gottlinger et al., 1993, Marassi et al., 1999, Montal, 2003, Schubert et al., 1996a). Gottlinger et al. (1993) have shown that Vpu can significantly enhance the release of Gag from heterologous retroviruses, such as HIV-2, visna virus, and Moloney murine leukemia virus, which do not normally express Vpu. Furthermore, Vpu can partially compensate for a Sindbis 6K-deleted virus (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2001). Taken together, the data suggests that Vpu does not directly interact with Gag during virus budding (Gottlinger et al., 1993). Co-expression of Gag and Vpu results in the redistribution of Gag from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (Deora et al., 2000). In the absence of Vpu, budding has been observed from internal membranes (Klimkait et al., 1990).",

Recently, it has been shown that Vpu shares homology with the N-terminal domain of the mammalian background K+ channel, TASK-1. Interaction of TASK-1 and Vpu results in Vpu abolishing TASK-1 currents. Overexpression of TASK-1 impaired Vpu-enhanced viral budding; however, the N-terminal domain of TASK-1 was able to enhance HIV-1 particle release (Hsu et al., 2004). Different levels of TASK-1 expression in various cell lines (Hsu et al., 2004) may explain why Vpu viral enhancement is cell type dependent (Geraghty et al., 1994, Gottlinger et al., 1991, Yao et al., 1992). Furthermore, Vpu and Gag have been shown to bind to viral protein U-binding Protein (Ubp) (Callahan et al., 1998, Geraghty et al., 1994). Ubp may play a role in targeting Gag to the plasma membrane (Handley et al., 2001).",
