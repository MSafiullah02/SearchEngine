            "text": "Avian influenza A H7N9 was first identified as a novel virus in China on 1st April 2013 [1]. While several variants of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been reported worldwide, poor management and initial denial of SARS in China made the H7H9 outbreak of particular concern [2]. During SARS the Chinese government kept the new outbreak secret, downplaying its emergence and treating it as a local issue best left to local bureaucracy [3]. Communication between provincial localities and bureaucratic departments was poor, and a lack of formal organisation meant poor provision of public health information, partly as a result of a separation between military and public healthcare [3]. Indeed it was not until SARS had spread to several neighbouring countries that it was publicly announced in China [4]. Partially as a result of criticism of their handling of the SARS crisis the Chinese government was keen to rapidly release accurate information about the novel H7N9 threat. Two weeks after the first case the Emergency Office of the Ministry of Health provided a series of behavioural recommendations, including taking greater care when preparing poultry or eggs, increasing hand-washing, ventilating homes and distancing oneself from those seeming to be infected [5]. Further, unlike in previous influenza crises, the Shanghai government closed all live poultry trade markets immediately following the first H7N9 fatality. In this study we examine early public responses to the H7N9 outbreak in southern Mainland China, including lay beliefs about the cause of the outbreak and those most at risk, trust in governmental responses, and uptake of recommended and non-recommended behaviours amongst citizens of Shanghai.",

The coincidence of the new H7N9 threat and the wide-spread reporting on the social media site Weibo of thousands of diseased pigs floating in a river key to Shanghai\u2019s water supply led to a municipal government press release denying any link [10]. Risk associations between avian influenza and the poultry industry echoed both official communications from the Chinese government and broader public concerns about farming methods during earlier influenza A outbreaks [7]. In particular, poor ventilation, unsanitary practices at markets and by chicken sellers [7], and the transport of poultry on long distance roads [11], was associated with a previous outbreak of H5N1. During both SARS [12] and previous influenza outbreaks [13] association of the viruses with particular 'others\u2019 allowed individuals to feel relatively safe from infection, and contributed to the victimisation of some groups [14]. In particular, newly arrived migrants were seen as bringing new threats to an indigenous population [15]. Other causal attributions \u2013 in both public discourse and the scientific literature \u2013 have linked influenza outbreaks to temperature and climatic factors [16]. In this paper we consider associations between H7N9 and 'floating pigs\u2019, new migrants, the poultry trade and wider temperature and climactic change.",

Beliefs about infection risks may change rapidly during an epidemic [9], making early understanding of cultural and psychological risk factors critical for subsequent health communication.

In this study relatively high levels of trust in Chinese government advice about H7N9 contrast positively with previous pandemic communications in this country. This may be the result of a new determination to provide rapid, reliable information on such threats in this country [22]. National and regional media, along with Chinese CDC, disseminated preventive knowledge and local governments updated their pandemic status on a daily basis. Mainstream media aside, the government made heavy use of new media, particularly Chinese microblogs to update information rapidly while cell phone news was updated regularly [23]. At the same time there was little evidence of the social amplification of anxiety via social media previously observed in the literature [24]. This may be a consequence of the fear of detention that followed arrests for spreading online rumours about the outbreak.",

Associations with seasonal and climatic variations in influenza, also suggested in the research literature [25], imply high awareness of temporal factors. Anxiety levels, while relatively low, were higher than those reported early on during H1N1 in Mainland China, where 72% claimed they were 'not worried\u2019 about infection [6]. Consistent with studies of pandemic threat elsewhere anxiety helped drive both recommended and non-recommended behaviours [19]. Almost a quarter of respondents reported cancelling travel plans, emphasising the significant economic impacts of pandemic threat [2]. There was also some evidence of stigmatisation and the 'othering\u2019 of those associated with the threat (e.g. migrants). Such findings have also been reported elsewhere during pandemic threat [13,21]. However, viewing children or those with weak immunity as at risk was also associated with reports in changes of behaviour, suggesting some sense of communal responsibility for some vulnerable groups.",

High levels of trust towards the government may reflect the relatively large number of respondents in our sample aged 65 or over.

Nevertheless our findings have important implications for clinicians and those working in health communication. Local expertise was particularly valued by our respondents, suggesting the efficacy of a new government strategy to provide rapid, transparent information. Other national authorities elsewhere may learn from this example when faced with emergent influenza threats. At the same time, even at this early stage of the pandemic threat, respondents reported buying preventive medicines, particularly local products. Public officials need to be aware that increased public anxiety may rapidly produce medical shortages. 'Common sense\u2019, lay beliefs about those at risk, and appropriate behaviours to adopt to avoid infection influence adherence and self-care, but are rarely considered by practitioners. Perceptions of enhanced risk from some groups, such as those from outside a city, may cause socially disruptive behaviours, particularly if threat levels increase. This emphasises the continuing need for clear risk communications in order to abate potential discrimination and public disorder during influenza threat.",
