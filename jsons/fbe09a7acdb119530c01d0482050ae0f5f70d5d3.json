Due to the presence of effective antivirals against different types of influenza viruses, rapid laboratory diagnosis may result in less antibiotic prescription and more frequent use of those antivirals. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has improved the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly with the use of multiplex real-time techniques with the capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens in a single reaction. Currently, this new method has been successfully applied to the routine diagnosis and epidemiological detection of respiratory infections including influenza in many centers with reasonable specificity and sensitivity. [7] [8] [9] On the other hand, current diagnostic methods for respiratory illnesses have some deficiencies in Iran. Due to inexpensive and low ,cost of antibiotic values across the country, physicians are unwilling about application of new diagnostics tools including molecularbased techniques. This may result in a prolonged stay of patients in hospital as well as in increased morbidity, possibly associated with inappropriate therapy. The aims of this study were to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu types among hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 142, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 143, "end": 144, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 309, "end": 310, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 497, "end": 498, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 640, "end": 641, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 796, "end": 798, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 799, "end": 800, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1606, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1610, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1614, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study population comprised of 540 patients who had been hospitalized in different wards in two flu seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) between December 2016 and May 2018.

Nevertheless, differentiation between influenza subtypes is of clinical importance because flu A infection may be associated with higher morbidity and mortality especially among older adults and immunocompromised individuals. 3 In the present study, we clearly showed that 40.5% of hospitalized patients admitted to Laleh hospital due to acute respiratory symptoms were infected by different types of influenza virus. Similar to our finding, others reported influenza prevalence between 34.5% and 52.2% circulating in Iran.

Horthongkham et al. reported 3.1% for flu B and they concluded that Victoria lineage was significantly associated with the duration of hospitalization. 7 However, in here, we did not analyze the lineage of flu B viruses in hospitalized patients. Cohen et al reported prevalence of 8% for influenza, A (H3N2) 37% and flu B (34%). 8 Garg et al. showed that fluA (H3N2) 62.8% and flu B (28.5%) had the highest rates for 2017-2018 influenza seasonality. 9 Among general and specific respiratory illness symptoms, we found that body pain and sore throat were the most significant symptoms among those who were flu positive compared to those who were flu negative.

Finding of different flu species, subtypes and variants would be useful for epidemiological investigations and for tracking outbreaks and also predict flu vaccine efficiency. Moreover, other flulike illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus and human metapeumovirus infections were missed from differential diagnosis in patients who were flu-negative. Moreover, coinfections between these viruses were also ignored. These latter issues are due to the absence of more comprehensive diagnostic tools for respiratory viral infection evaluation at least in our center. In conclusion, despite no other respiratory pathogen were investigated, these results showed that almost 40% of patients admitted to Laleh hospital were infected by influenza virus.
