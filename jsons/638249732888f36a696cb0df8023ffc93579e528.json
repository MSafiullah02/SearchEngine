Therefore, in an animal model of mild hypovolemia, we investigated whether a PEEP challenge might predict fluid responsiveness. The hypothesis was if PEEP reduces cardiac output (CO), this would indicate fluid responsiveness at 0 cmH2O PEEP, while on the other hand if PEEP does not reduce CO, this would indicate that further fluid administration will not improve circulation. INTRODUCTION. beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors (ARs) mediate the primary effects of catecholamines in the mammalian heart. Although structurally similar, these receptor subtypes differ in some important ways. For example, continuous beta2AR stimulation protects the heart. Continuous beta1AR activation causes myocardial injury. Previously, the beta2AR was thought to play only a minor role in the enhancement of cardiac inotropic performance. Our data suggest that this theory may be incorrect. We found that in the absence of beta2ARs, cardiac contractility was significantly impaired.",

Our PV loop data were consistent with the MRI findings and demonstrated that differences in the cardiac performance were not simply a result of differences in preload. Cardiac contractility was impaired in beta2KO mice. Absence of beta2ARs during development might cause structural changes that lead to reduced cardiac inotropic performance of beta2KO mice. We are currently testing this hypothesis using conditional beta2KO mice in which beta2AR expression is suppressed only in adult animals. We favor the hypothesis that beta2ARs facilitate the primary role of the beta1ARs in stimulating cardiac contractility. According to this hypothesis, direct interaction between beta1ARs and beta2ARs (e.g., heterodimer formation) or interaction at the intracellular signaling level might occur. In the absence of these interactions, attenuation of b1AR-mediated stimulation of inotropic performance would be expected. INTRODUCTION. ICU patients with Multiple Organ Failure (MOF) benefit from iv glutamine supplementation in terms of mortality and morbidity. Also neurosurgical patients in the ICU may be candidates for exogenous glutamine support, but in head trauma patients there are concerns regarding the close connection between glutamine and glutamate. Elevated intracerebral levels of glutamate are seen in patients with high ICP and an unfavourable outcome.

Under conditions of severe sepsis, paired glucose readings indicate a close relation between arterial blood and SAT. Introduction of a 6-hour stabilisation period for the trauma as caused by the microdialysis probe results in a substantial improvement of this relation.

Following positive results of the PROWESS randomised controlled trial [1], drotrecogin alfa (activated) received a European licence in 2002.

Patient suitability was assessed by the Outreach nurses and prescribed by critical care doctors. Treatment was initiated with CPAP mask but if poorly tolerated, a CPAP hood was used. Some patients' therapy was initiated with the hood, if for example they had previous facial surgery or claustrophobia. Extensive training of nursing, medical staff and physiotherapists was undertaken by the outreach nurse educator in areas of the hospital currently able to care for patients requiring facial CPAP. Training packs including guidelines, photographs and nursing care protocols were provided to each area.",

            "text": "After IRB approval, ICU nurses received a 1-hour theoretical training to learn how to place ED probe in order to measure flow velocity from the descending aorta. They were asked to obtain the best possible flow velocity signal in stable, sedated, mechanically ventilated patients monitored by ED (CardioQ, Deltex) . The numeric values for SV and parameters derived from the velocity envelope remained hidden, and the signal was considered optimal when spectral brightness and peak flow velocity were maximum. Gain was adjusted to optimize signal/noise ratio. The monitor was set to average SV values over 5 cardiac cycles to minimize respiratory variability. The operators (nurses and experts) were asked to freeze the scrolling when they thought they had obtained the best signal, and an independent observer recorded the SV values. After SV acquisition, the probe was retrieved by a few centimeters to loose the signal and the operator was asked to replace it two more times. Experts completed their SV acquisitions immediately before or after nurses. SV values obtained by nurses (SVnurs) and experts (SVexp) were calculated as the average of the 3 consecutive measurements. Correlation and agreement between SVnurs and SVexp have been studied, as well as intra-observer reproducibility for each category. A Mann-Whitney test was used to check if bias was statistically different from 0.RESULTS. 36 nurses and 3 experts have made 125 triplets of SV measures in 35 patients. Mean SV measured by the experts was 68 +/-20 mL, and by the nurses was 66 +/-21 mL. Intra-observer reproducibility was 10%, for both, nurses and experts. The correlation between SVnurs and SVexp was very tight (r 2 =0.88), and the agreement was characterized by a systematic bias of + 2 mL (SVexp > SVnurs; p<10-4) and limits of agreement of +/-14 mL.",

This is a significant decline (P = 0.0156). When comparing the 2001-2004 with the 1997-2000 period one can also see a significant decline in the number of ICU admissions after CPR; 71 versus 41 (P < 0.01). In the period before the introduction of the DNR protocol the percentage of patients who were alive after 24 hours was 14% for cardiac arrest patients, 69% for respiratory arrest and 84% for other serious events. In the period after the introduction the percentage of patients who were alive after 24 hours was 14% for cardiac arrest patients, 67% for respiratory arrest and 93% for other serious events.CONCLUSION. The introduction of a DNR protocol has led to a significant reduction in emergency calls and also a significant reduction in ICU admissions after CPR. There is no shift in type of event. The 24 hour survival percentage for cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest and other serious events is roughly the same before and after the introduction of a DNR protocol.",
