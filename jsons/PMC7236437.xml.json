There will be a focus on increasing participants\u2019 awareness of their priorities, through an investigation of the pros and cons of changing a specific behaviour (self-management e.g. fear avoidance of exercise) and assisting them to develop a specific plan to change (planning, goal setting). Other components of the programme will include pacing of activities, managing setbacks, stress and stress management as well as long term behaviour change. The SPHERe practitioners will be trained in motivational interviewing to assess patients\u2019 current beliefs and encourage behaviour change.

Lay partners and co-applicants were fully integrated into every stage of trial development, taking an active role in refining intervention components and reviewing the application. A lay co-applicant currently sits on the trial management group (TMG), initially meeting monthly and subsequently quarterly, and has a pivotal role in steering the conduct of the trial. She reviewed the ethics application to ensure that trial documentation e.g. participant information leaflet, was user appropriate. Lay partners have been actively involved in trial publicity and media and will help with the dissemination of findings through appropriate channels i.e. social media, lay conferences, public engagement events, service provider events, newsletter articles. Lay partners also sit on the TSC as verified independent members. Lay co-apps and partners are supported by the chief investigator (CI), trial management team, and through the peer support of lay partners on existing clinical trials. Comprehensive training and support was provided by WCTU.",
