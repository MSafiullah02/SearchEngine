Examples include the emergence of zoonotic diseases in wildlife populations, concurrent with a novel outbreak of disease in humans, such as West Nile virus, SARS, and avian influenza (Scotch et al. 2009). Wild animals can also act as indicators of diseases circulating among domestic animals or other wildlife. For example, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been used to detect Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rainwater et al. 2006) and Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Yabsley et al. 2003), and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) to detect bovine tuberculosis (Nugent et al. 2002).

They are predators and carrion consumers, and thus, prone to come in contact with disease agents contaminating the environment or infecting live or dead animals (Anderson et al. 2007; Sobrino et al. 2007); therefore, they could act as sentinels. For example, sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) can act as sentinels to detect Toxoplasma gondii contamination in coastal environments (Conrad et al. 2005) and coyotes (Canis latrans) have been used to detect Mycobacterium bovis circulation in wildlife and domestic animals. In Michigan, focusing surveillance on coyotes, rather than on white-tailed deer increased the detection of M. bovis by 40% (VerCauteren et al. 2008).",

Wolves in Spain depend largely on domestic and wild ungulates as a food source (Cuesta et al. 1991; Barja 2009). Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are ubiquitous, anthropophilic generalists, with a species abundance ranging from 0.5 to 10 foxes per square kilometer (Gort\u00e1zar 1997). They are also a game species, which makes sample collection relatively easy. In Spain, the fox behaves as a facultative predator, feeding on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) when they are abundant and shifting to other prey (including carrion of wild and domestic ungulates) when rabbits are scarce (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008).",

MAP also occurs in many non-ruminant mammals and in several bird species. However, the significance of MAP in non-ruminant wildlife is largely unknown (Daniels et al. 2003). Among carnivores, sporadic isolation of MAP has been reported in foxes, Eurasian badgers (Meles meles), stoats (Mustela erminea), and weasels (Mustela nivalis) in Scotland (Beard et al. 2001), and from a red fox in Greece (Florou et al. 2008). In Spain, MAP is widespread among both domestic and wild ruminants (Garrido 2001; Falconi et al. 2010) and has also been recorded in wild rabbits (the authors, submitted). Among red deer (Cervus elaphus), for instance, 30% antibody prevalence was reported, and contact with cattle was identified as a risk factor (Reyes-Garc\u00eda et al. 2008).",

Briefly, high adsorption capacity Costar polystyrene microtiter plates (Cultek, Madrid, Spain) were coated with 50 \u03bcl/well of 0.02 mg/ml paratuberculosis protoplasmatic antigen 3 (PPA-3) diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (Sigma, Madrid, Spain). The serum samples were adsorbed (1:1, v/v) with a saline suspension of Mycobacterium phlei (5 g/l) (Allied Monitor, Inc., Fayette, MO, USA) and left at 4\u00b0C overnight to remove nonspecific anti-Mycobacterium spp. antibodies (Milner et al. 1987). Thereafter, the plates were washed once with a washing solution (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with 200 \u03bcl/well of blocking solution (5% nonfat dried milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). After a 1-h incubation period at room temperature, sera diluted 1:20 (v/v) in PBS solution were added into wells of the antigen-coated plate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, before being washed four times with the washing solution. Anti-dog IgG peroxidase antibody produced in rabbits was used as conjugate (Sigma\u00b8 0.002 mg/ml in blocking solution) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After four washes with washing solution, 200 \u03bcl/well of substrate solution (Fast OPD, Sigma) were added. Approximately 20 min later, the reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcl/well of H2SO4 3N and optical density (OD) was measured in a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. Since no positive controls were available, we used 2\u00d7the mean OD as a conservative arbitrary cutoff (see Fig. 2).\n\n",

No wolf serum yielded high ODs, suggesting no contact with MAP or cross-reacting mycobacteria. In the foxes, a few sera (4%) had relatively high ODs, suggesting some contact with mycobacteria. These occurred mainly in two bTB endemic areas of Southern Spain, suggesting that cross-reactions after contact with M. bovis could have influenced the ELISA results. Serological cross-reactions of M. bovis, and MAP have often been reported (e.g., Buddle et al. 2010). Alternatively, rabbits are more abundant in Southern Spain and consumption of MAP-infected rabbits could also explain the few antibody-positive fox sera.",

As was discussed earlier, both wolves and foxes include significant portions of wild ruminants and rabbits in their diet. Thus, exposure to MAP was expected but not confirmed. The contrast with the high-PCR positivity recorded among carnivores in Wisconsin (Anderson et al. 2007) may be explained by the small number of PCR-tested samples in the present study.

However, this lack of visible lesions in a large sample of wild canids, along with the absence of microscopic lesions in the studied subsample, adds to the view that wild canids play no relevant role in the epidemiology of mycobacterial diseases in Southwestern Europe. This finding, in addition to the absence of MAP detection by culture and PCR, suggests that wild canids show little or no evidence of paratuberculosis and are unlikely to be useful sentinels for the detection of MAP in Southwestern Europe.
