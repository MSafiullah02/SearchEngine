The pilgrim makes overnight stops in Mina en route to Arafat, and in Muzdaliffah on return (figure 1\n). On returning to Mina, the pilgrim stops at Jamarat to stone the pillars that are effigies of Satan. The new Hajjee (a pilgrim who has completed the Hajj) then makes an animal sacrifice (usually by proxy) as thanks for an accepted Hajj. After a farewell Tawaf, the pilgrim leaves Mecca.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the most common pathogen identified (13 [20%] patients). If validated, this study could have important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and infection control of pneumonia at the Hajj. Until then, physicians should keep a high index of suspicion for tuberculosis in patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia during the Hajj. The immune response to tuberculosis antigens with a whole blood assay (QuantiFERON TB assay) has been measured in Singaporean pilgrims before, and 3 months after the Hajj.23 Of 357-paired assays, 149 pilgrims had negative tests before the Hajj. But 15 (10%) of these had a substantial rise in immune response to the antigens during the Hajj. This rise indicates that pilgrims from low tuberculosis-endemicity should be screened with a two-step purified protein derivative or QuantiFERON-TB before the Hajj and 3 months after, to detect new conversions.24, 25, 26, 27 The prevalence of resistant tuberculosis is up to three times greater in Mecca and Medina than Saudi national averages.28, 29 This difference is due to the annual influx of pilgrims from areas of high tuberculosis-endemicity.30\n",

Data from 1999 for hepatitis serology in 158 Hajj barbers showed that seven (4%) were positive for HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), 16 (10%) were HCV-positive, and one (0\u00b76%) was positive for HbeAg (hepatitis B \u201ce\u201d antigen), indicating high infectivity.58 Saudi authorities continue to take an aggressive legislative stance to prevent unlicensed barbers from operating during the Hajj. All pilgrims need to be aware of these hazards and must be shaved only at designated centres. Since there are no published data to document the significance of head shaving in HBV transmission to pilgrims, and since the HBV vaccine series takes 6 months to complete, it is difficult to recommend the HBV vaccine to all pilgrims. Individuals who are counselled in sufficient time before the Hajj, and who can afford the vaccine cost, should take the HBV vaccine.",
