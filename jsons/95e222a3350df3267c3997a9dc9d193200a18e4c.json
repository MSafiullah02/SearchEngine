To discover cellular protein responses of PK-15 cells to PCV2 infection, two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling was employed to quantitatively identify the proteins that were differentially expressed in PK-15 from the PCV2-infected group compared to the uninfected control group. A total of 196 cellular proteins in PK-15 that were significantly altered at different time periods postinfection were identified. These differentially expressed proteins were related to the biological processes of binding, cell structure, signal transduction, cell adhesion, etc. and their interactions. Moreover, some of these proteins were further confirmed by Western blot. The high number of differentially expressed proteins identified should be very useful in elucidating the mechanism of replication and pathogenesis of PCV2 in the future. analysis has been utilized for host cellular responses to virus infection. used two proteomics strategies, 2-DE and 1-DE, followed by (16)O/(18)O peptide labeling, identification, and quantification via MS, leading to the detection of more than 100 differentially expressed proteins during PCV2 infection in an in vivo environment. Additionally, Zhang et al. [15.] identified 34 host-encoded proteins that were altered in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF, while Fan and colleagues [16] detected 163 proteins that were significantly affected in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells with the SI-LAC-based approach. The group of Cheng [17] examined PCV2-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) using 2-DE, followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and identified 21 host-encoded proteins modified by the virus. A quantitative proteomics approach by our group revealed significant alterations in 145 cellular proteins in PCV2 infected PAMs at different time periods post-infection [18].",

The virus genome contains two major open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 encodes the replication proteins which are involved in virus replication, and ORF2 encodes the capsid (Cap) protein [2, 3] . PCV2 has been identified as the etiologic agent of the Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) [4, 5] that is widely spread in swine farms and represents one of several porcine circovirus associated diseases (PCVAD). PCV2 infection usually accompanies lymphocyte or monocyte depletion and thus further results in immune suppression in the disease [6, 7] . The immunosuppressive disease mainly presents as PMWS, which caused a great economic loss worldwide [8, 9] . However, the immunosuppressive and pathogenic mechanisms have remained unclear in PCV2infected pigs.",

The analysis revealed several proteins with interesting interactions, including Hspa12a-Hyou1-Hspa5-Hspd1-Rsp16-Rsp18-Rpl5 and Canx-Calx-Ppib-Ppl10-Prdx2-Anxa2-Anxa1-Vim. These seed proteins play important functions in signal transduction and cell adhesion.

AnnexinI, and Rab-11A showed down-regulation in the prophase of infection, and then, they up-regulated later.

The changes of host gene production in virus-infected cells have been largely studied to elucidate pathogenic mechanism associated with such alterations. However, very limited information is currently available for cellular protein productions regulated after exposed to individual viral components. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in PCV2 infection of host cells, we screened the differentially expressed proteins associated with PK-15 cells infected with the virus using comparative proteomics. Several earlier studies have analyzed the interplay between PCV2 and host cells using proteomics analysis, which includes interactions of PCV2 and PK-15 cells [15, 16] , porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) [17, 18] , and inguinal lymph nodes of piglets inoculated with PCV2 [14] . In order to determine further virus-host interactions and the processes leading to disease onset, a high-throughput quantitative proteomic approach, iTRAQ was utilized to investigate the differential proteomes of a highly permissive PK-15 clone cells in response to PCV2 infection. The results indicated that a total of 196 proteins displayed significantly altered expression at different time points post-infection. Four of these proteins were confirmed to be regulated in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells using immunoblotting as an independent analytical method. It provided critical clues for further analysis of PCV2 pathogenesis.",

This procedure is ideally suited to our study, since it allows the comparison of four time points after infection and four corresponding controls. Compared with mock infection, PCV2 did not induce visible cytopathic effects. Furthermore, the full cell monolayer appeared in PCV2-infected cells. Both IFA and Western blot results disclosed that PCV2 replicates in PK-15 cells. Differentially expressed proteins are involved in cytoskeleton organization, macromolecular biosynthesis, signal transduction, stress response, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), and metabolic enzymes (Table 1) . Our data aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of PCV2 infection. In our previous quantitative proteomics study, we identified that Hsp70 was up-regulated in PCV2infected PAMs [18] . Then, we firstly found that Hsp70 could positively regulate PCV2 replication in a continuous porcine monocytic cell line 3D4/31 [27] . It can be seen that the results of proteomics study should be useful to elucidate the mechanism of replication of PCV2 in the future.",

The existing evidence suggests that actin can regulate gene transcription in virusinduced signaling. The mRNA-binding activity of actin is important for the anchoring, transporting, and topological positioning of mRNAs [29] . With regard to b-tubulin, there are several reports showing that viruses may require microtubule components for RNA synthesis [30] . a-tubulin was identified as being overexpressed when it interacts with Rep of PCV2 through colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation analyses [15] . Changes in b-tubulin and vimentin levels have been detected in SARS-CoV22 and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) [26, 31] . However, Fan et al. [16. ] indicated that b-tubulin level was downregulated in infected PK-15 cells and speculated that the vimentin and b-tubulin networks collapse and disperse in host cells, leading to an unstable cytoskeletal structure and release of viral particles from the infected cells. The roles of these cytoskeletal proteins in PK15 cells after PCV2 infection should be further investigated.",

Activation of the heat shock response might be a specific virus function that ensures proper synthesis of viral proteins and virions; thus, stress proteins may be important for virus replication [33] . Mammalian cells have developed response networks which detect and control diverse forms of stress. One of these responses, known as heat shock response, is a universal mechanism necessary for cell survival under a variety of unfavorable conditions like virus infections [34] . In the present study, the up-regulation of Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp60 was identified in the PCV2-infected PK-15 cells (Table 1) . Hsp60 is a mitochondrial chaperonin that is typically responsible for the transportation and refolding of proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix, and it was reported that Hsp60 folds 30 % of the cytoplasmic proteins under heat stress [35] . One study reported that Hsp60 can directly activate leukocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and interleukins, which participate in the process of T cell-mediated immunity [36] . It has been reported that HSPs inhibit the replication of IV and a variety of RNA viruses [37] . Inhibition of the expression of Hsc70 blocks the nuclear export of the IV M1 and NP proteins and thereby inhibits the production of the progeny virus [37] . Previously, we demonstrated that Hsp70 has a positive regulatory effect on PCV2 infection cycle, based on proteomics results on PCV2-infected PAMs [27] . Hsp90 has a very important function in the folding of cell regulatory proteins and the refolding of stress-denatured polypeptides [38] [39] [40] . Prior research has also shown that Hsp90 is involved in the assembly and nuclear export process of IV RNPs [41] . A previous report showed that an initial increase in Hsp90 expression at 12 h after infection suggests a cellular response to hMPV-induced ER stress initiated by an increase in unfolded or misfolded proteins [42] . Recently, an association between Hsp90 protein complex and lamin A/C has been observed after oxidative stress [43] . Also, in our PCV2-infected PK-15 cells, we observe an increase in Hsp90 and lamin subunit beta. Here, the increased information should be helpful to study on the molecular mechanisms underlying host-PCV2 interactions.",

The 14-3-3 protein family is known to be involved in the regulation of several signal transduction pathways including those regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, transcription, and stress responses [44] . A prior study reported that the 14-3-3 protein interacts with the HCV core protein to activate kinase Raf-1 [45] , and the identified interaction of the 14-3-3 protein with Vpr has a functional significance for cell cycle regulation in HIV-1 infection [46] . In our study, the expression of 14-3-3 protein in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells was down-regulated. This occurrence may be due to the cellular physiology dysfunction of PK-15 cells. Further work is clearly necessary to examine the function of 14-3-3 protein in PCV2-infected tissues.",

Some viruses have been reported to evolve different strategies to utilize the UPP for beneficial reasons, including the indication that ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for avoidance of host immune surveillance during HIV-1 and is necessary for transcriptional regulation of the DNA virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) [48, 49] . Mumps virus and simian virus inhibit JAK/STAT signaling pathway through proteasome degradation of the cellular STAT protein to escape the interferon-initiated antiviral responses [50] . In this study, PCV2 infection induced expression of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, proteasome 26S subunit, and ubiquitin-associated protein 2. Therefore, their change in abundance levels may indicate to an important pathway affected by PCV2 replication. Whether PCV2 takes the similar or different strategy during infection has not been elucidated and deserves further investigation.",
