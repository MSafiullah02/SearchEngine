Accordingly, the removal of the C-terminal phenylalanine of PL250 resulted in a large decrease in affinity (K i = 2.17 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 M). Furthermore, it was observed that the C-terminal carboxyl group of the inhibitor makes no direct interactions with the amino acids of the APN active site.

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN; EC 3.4.11.2) is a well conserved exopeptidase (Maroux et al., 1973) that is expressed in a broad spectrum of species (bacteria, plants, insects and mammals) in which it plays an important role in the final digestion of peptides. This type II membrane-bound zinc peptidase is also widely distributed in mammalian tissues, including the central nervous system (Hersh et al., 1987; Noble et al., 2001; Larrinaga et al., 2005) , and is particularly abundant in the kidney, the intestine and the lung (Maroux et al., 1973; Hersh et al., 1987) . In vivo, this enzyme is involved in the catabolism of biologically active peptides such as angiotensin III (Zini et al., 1996) , nociceptin (Montiel et al., 1997) and enkephalins in association with neprilysin (Roques et al., 1993) in the brain and in peripheral organs. Furthermore, APN is identical to the human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CD13 (Look et al., 1989) and behaves as a receptor for coronaviruses TGEV and 229E in pigs and humans (Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992) . Moreover, APN has recently been shown to play an important role in the invasion of metastatic tumours (Saiki et al., 1993; Hashida et al., 2002) and in angiogenesis (Sato, 2004) .",

All these groups replace the water molecule Wat1 that is present in ligand-free APN Addlagatta et al., 2006) . The conformations of the amino-acid side chains around the zinc ion were almost identical in the ligand-free APN, APNbestatin and APN-PL250 complexes, with the exception of Glu298 (Fig. 5c) . Indeed, in the APN-PL250 complex, Glu298, which functions as the catalytic base, was shifted by 0.66 \u00c5 from its corresponding position in the APN-bestatin complex. This shift of Glu298 is related to the phosphinic group, in which the oxygen (P)O2 was found at 1.04 \u00c5 from the position of Wat1 in the free enzyme and at 0.73 \u00c5 from the hydroxyl group of bestatin in its complex with APN. In the Michaelis complex, the NH amide group in the P 0 1 position of the substrate was expected to form hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of Ala262 and the carboxyl group of Glu298 . It was also expected that these hydrogen bonds would be conserved in the tetrahedral transition state mimicked by the phosphinic inhibitor. Consistent with this hypothesis, the CH 2 group of the phosphinic moiety, which corresponds to the NH group in the P 0 1 position, was in close contact (3.17 \u00c5 ) with the carbonyl group of Ala262 and was separated from Glu298 by 4.06 \u00c5 .",

For example, in the M4 family the transition state is stabilized by a tyrosine residue and a histidine residue (Tyr157 and His231 for thermolysin TLN; Matthews, 1988; Beaumont et al., 1995) , whereas in the neprilysin family (M13 family) only one histidine is involved (His711; Dion et al., 1993; Marie-Claire et al., 1998; Schultz et al., 2009) in the same process. Furthermore, the involvement of a tyrosine in the transition-state stabilization is not restricted to peptidases of the MA clan, since Tyr149 was shown to play this role in astacin (family M12 clan MB; Grams et al., 1996) . In the APN-bestatin complex, the formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr381 and the O atom of the amide group (2.64 \u00c5 ) of the inhibitor was proposed to mimic the stabilization of the tetrahedral transition state that occurs during the enzymatic process Addlagatta et al., 2006; Figs. 5b and 5c) . This was confirmed in this study with PL250, which corresponds to a true transition-state analogue. In this case, one of the P-(O) O atoms forms a hydrogen bond to Tyr381 OH (2.66 \u00c5 ). Interestingly, this tyrosine is well conserved in the M1 peptidase family, suggesting that this amino acid plays the same stabilizing role in all these enzymes.",

The benzyl group of PL250 at the P 0 1 position is bound to the same open hydrophobic cleft as the isobutyl group in the APN-bestatin complex (Figs. 3 and 4) . This phenyl ring is oriented almost perpendicularly to Tyr275, with a distance of 5.59 \u00c5 between the centres of the aromatic rings. One of the carboxyl O atoms of Asp327, located in the S 0 1 subsite at a distance of 4.00 \u00c5 from the benzyl group of PL250, is involved in a hydrogen bond (2.78 \u00c5 ) to His297, a ligand of the zinc ion. These various interactions are hypothesized to stabilize the inhibitor inside the active site.",

In this case, stabilization of the complex could be ensured by interactions with APN hydrophilic amino acids located in the S 0 1 subsite, such as Asp327 in E. coli APN. The importance of this residue is confirmed by its isosteric replacement by Glu413 in hog APN and Glu418 in human APN. This suggests that the acidic residue conserved in this subsite may be able to interact with a P 0 1 side chain containing positively charged groups through hydrogen bonding. In accordance with this assumption, peptides with a lysine or an arginine residue in the P 0 1 position, such as thymopentin, somatostatin and neurokinin A, were shown to be cleaved by APN (Noren et al., 1997) .",

In the complex with PL250, the hydrogen bond between Gly261 NH and the CO of the amide bond is also observed, but owing to the presence of a P 0 2 moiety the interaction with the two arginine residues is lacking. In this conformation, Arg825 actually lines the S 0 2 subsite along with Thr377, Tyr376 and Met260 and all these residues are close to the centre of the aromatic ring of the C-terminal Phe (Fig. 3) . One O atom of the carboxylate group of PL250 interacts through two water molecules with the -carboxylate of Glu382, which adopts two different positions (a and b) in the crystal (Fig. 3) .",

In mammalian APN, however, this network is not as conserved; in human APN the analogue of Lys319 is Asn410 and Glu121 is replaced by Gln213. Moreover, Gln136, Glu271, Glu318 and Asn317 in human LTA4H, which belongs to the same M1 family, replace the Glu121, Glu264, Glu320 and Lys319 residues of E. coli APN, respectively. These residues are identical in human LTA4H and in human APN. In the LTA4H-bestatin complex (PDB code 1hs6; Thunnissen et al., 2001) , a water molecule is located at the corresponding position to an \"-amino group of Lys319 in E. coli APN and the hydrogen-bonding network is formed through this water molecule.

However, the structure of the APNbestatin complex showed that the side chain of Met260 is able to move in order to facilitate the interaction of larger residues (such as the benzyl side chain of bestatin) inside this pocket Addlagatta et al., 2006) . In mammalian APN, Met260 is replaced by an alanine residue (Ala351 in human enzyme), leading to an extended cavity which could accept large side chains, such as a phenethyl group, without a requirement for side-chain transconformation. This accounts for the identical inhibitory potency of various aminophosphinic derivatives, such as compounds 3 and 4 (Table 2) , towards hog APN, whatever the size of the S 1 -interacting side chain (Chen et al., 1999) . Interestingly, this is different for E. coli APN inhibition, where the K i values of compounds 3 and 4 are 1.5 and 25 nM, respectively. This tenfold decrease in affinity could result from an energetically consuming transconformational process involving the side chain of Met260.",
