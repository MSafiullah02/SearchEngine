Given the high mortality from this disease, particularly in the more vulnerable members of society, it is important to examine how best to deliver a high standard of end of life care during this crisis. This case series collected data from two acute hospitals examining the management of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 who subsequently died (n=36) and compared this to national and local end of life audit data for all other deaths. Our results demonstrated a shorter dying phase (38.25 hours vs 74 hours) and higher rates of syringe driver use (72% vs 33% in local audits), although with similar average mediation doses. Of note was the significant heterogeneity in the phenotype of deterioration in the dying phase, two distinct patterns emerged, with one group demonstrating severe illness with a short interval between symptom onset and death and another group presenting with a more protracted deterioration. This brief report suggests a spectrum of mode of dying. Over all the cohort reflects previously described experiences, with increased frailty (median Clinical Frailty Scale score of 5) and extensive comorbidity burden. This brief report provides clinicians with a contemporaneous overview of our experience, knowledge and pattern recognition when caring for people with Covid-19 and highlights the value of proactive identification of patients and risk of deterioration and palliation.",

Though data exists regarding effective triage of people during humanitarian crises (1) , this is the first time that developed healthcare systems have been placed under sustained and at times overwhelming pressure. Emerging data has described the active management and outcomes of Covid-19 patients (2) (3) (4) , however at present there is little information to help inform the management of those patients recognised as dying. The surge in people requiring care means services are stretched and finite resources must be allocated efficiently. Understanding the dying process in Covid-19 patients in an environment that presents additional challenges of potentially limited resource and comprehensive infection control precautions, is crucial in order to deliver high standards of care.",

The trust is based across two acute hospital sites in Worthing and Chichester and serves a population of 450,000 people, with a large proportion of older individuals and those living with frailty. We envisaged using the data to review the challenges faced during this pandemic and examine whether any patterns are arising, including unanticipated ones, to inform future care pathways. Even within an overburdened health system with finite resources, integrating palliative care is essential (5-6) when looking at delivering the wider Covid-19 service, so that clinicians are able to provide the best standards of care to all our population.",

            "text": "Following our clinical experience having observed patients with apparently different trajectories of illness and dying we were able to group patients with full notes (n=30) based on severity of symptoms at presentation and the duration of illness. In those patients we were able to suggest different phenotypes of dying from Covid-19 based upon how the patient first presented to hospital -either those quickly identified as being very unwell or those in whom symptoms were less obvious or severe. These groups of patients are summarised in table 1. Different phenotypes of dying emerge (see Table 1 ) broadly we have observed one cohort, Group 1 (n=11) who develop a severe disease over the course of several days, have a short admission, are recognised as being very unwell at presentation and progress to a short terminal phase, less than 48 hours, although typically even less than this. These patients had a wide range of ages, and frailty scores although they tended to be younger and less frail on average. All however did have significant comorbidities. The second cohort, Group 2 (n=14) either had less severe symptoms at presentation or presented atypically and had a longer duration of illness and dying phase. These patients were all over 75 years and the majority were either moderately or severely frail, with none scoring less than 5 on their CFS. It could be that this frail group did not experience severe Covid-19 but instead that they were already extremely vulnerable and had limited abilities to overcome any illness which is a feature common to those we see dying of other causes with frailty. The duration of the dying phase in this cohort is similar to what we usually see in palliative care. A smaller number (Group 3, n=5) did not fit either of these groups; they too were elderly with multiple comorbidities but not necessarily frail prior to admission. They had a long duration of illness and length of hospital stay but a very rapid deterioration and dying phase. It could be that in this group the dying phase was simply not recognised as such for some time or that there was a super-imposed illness in an already vulnerable and deconditioned individual.",

Recognised Covid-19 symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea and anxiety, (10) as well as agitation and delirium are typically very distressing and therefore may well necessitate a higher proportion of patients being managed with syringe drivers to ease the symptom burden appropriately. Mean doses used however were comparable between this cohort and those seen in previous audits, and is consistent with data published from other centres (11). This suggests that although more patients appear to require these medications, their symptoms are controllable to the same extent as patients dying from other causes.",

The symptom burden may be higher than we typically see, as demonstrated by higher requirement for syringe drivers. It is therefore important to recognise this so patients diagnosed as dying can have access to early use of appropriate treatments to allow for a comfortable and dignified death. We perhaps need to acknowledge that in those with any symptoms requiring medication, there will be little benefit in delaying the introduction of a syringe driver once identified as dying. The recognition of the emerging phenotypes of dying, especially amongst vulnerable, comorbid and frail patients deemed not likely to benefit from critical care, will help clinicians in terms of modifying expectations and discussing prognosis with their families.",
