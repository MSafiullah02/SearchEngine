In literatures, the technical measures related to negative pressure isolation ward was inclined to adopt high negative pressure, air-tight door and all fresh air, where it was considered safe only to increase the negative pressure as high as possible, to install air-tight door without infiltration air and to provide all fresh air.",

It should be noted that here it only mention the state of close, not the sealing condition, which will be explained later. So the main purposed of the pressure drop is only limited to the static state of the closed openings. During the instantaneous moment for dynamic opening of door, the pressure drop is converted into the kinetic energy of airflow through the opening. The magnitude of airflow velocity reflects the ability to prevent the entrance of pollutant, which is not dependent on the magnitude of original pressure difference. For the given flow rate with compensation of pressure difference, the value of airflow velocity is fixed.",

Because of the opening of doors, movement of workers and patients, temperature difference, and the stack effect exaggerated by straight pipeline, elevator shaft and vertical ventilation shaft, it is difficult to control airflow reasonably between rooms. When some factor becomes larger than the actual controlled range, the influence of these factors could be minimized through the modification during the design of positive and negative pressure values in some rooms or regions. It has been pointed out by author that this incomplete understanding is caused because that they do not understand the invasion or release of pollution and they do not know that the pressure is not the sole factor [3] . This can be analyzed from two aspects as follows.",

In order to avoid the influence of supply air, indoor vortex and opening/closing of doors on the measurement of pressure difference, which should be paid attention to especially for small room, exterior hood should be placed at the original test hole and the vent hole should be set beneath the hood, which is shown in Fig. 2.4 .",

In the latter experiment, the operation of addition of 200 g additive was performed in a negative pressure room. After 3 min, it was considered that released particles from operation had been dispersed evenly in the room. Then the particle concentration at the return air opening was measured, until it recovered to the original concentration. Based on the increased concentration value and the flow rate of return air, the released particle number could be obtained. In this experiment, the number of generated particles each time was 2.6 \u00c2 10 8 pc. Then the door was open and closed. Once the door was closed, occupant walked towards the return air opening and measured the particle concentration near the return air opening in the corridor. The method was the same to the above-mentioned one. The relationship between the pressure difference and the dispersion of pollutant particles is shown in Fig. 2 ",

Colored B. subtilis Spores were generated in the ward. The CFUs in the ward were measured when the pressure difference between the ward and the exterior buffer room was \u22125 and 0 Pa, respectively. The CFU in the buffer room was then measured after people left the ward and entered into the buffer room by opening the door for once time. The temperature differences under two pressure difference values were almost the same. Result showed that the CFU was not inversely proportional to the pressure difference. The influence of the pressure difference on CFU was little, which is shown in Table 2 .7.",

Because the temperatures of intake and outtake flows are different, the density q of hot air is small, so v is large. While the density q of cold air is large, so v is small. Since the thermal pressure is very small, illusion will be formed that the thermal prepared can be counteracted by the pressure difference easily. However, when door is closed, the intake flow rate by negative pressure difference is exerted on the small area such as door gap. When door is open, the convective flow rate by thermal pressure is exerted on a half of the door opening. When the value of pressure difference is equal to that of the thermal pressure, the former flow rate is much less than the latter. When the former flow rate was exerted on the door opening area, the air velocity formed cannot counteract the air velocity by the latter flow rate.

But this researcher did not pay attention to the impossibility for the formation of such a large exhaust flow in the ward. Even in the normal condition, the pressure difference is unable to counteract the convection by temperature difference. This conclusion has not been proposed. On the contrary, until now it is believed that the pressure difference is able to counteract the convection by temperature difference (refer to the section about pressure difference).

The air velocity in the lower region of the door opening from the corridor to the ward reached 0.7 m/s. The air velocity in the upper region of the door opening reached 0.3 m/s with the opposite direction.
