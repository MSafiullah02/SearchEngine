            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats and is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV). Tissue culture-adapted type I FCoV shows reduced FIP induction in experimental infections, which complicates the understanding of FIP pathogenesis caused by type I FCoV. We previously found that the type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently induces FIP in specific-pathogenfree cats through the naturally infectious route. In this study, we employed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based reverse genetics system to gain more insights into FIP caused by the C3633 strain. We successfully generated recombinant virus (rC3663) from Fcwf-4 cells transfected with infectious cDNA that showed growth kinetics similar to those shown by the parental virus. Next, we constructed a reporter C3663 virus carrying the nanoluciferase (Nluc) gene to measure viral replication with high sensitivity. The inhibitory effects of different compounds against rC3663-Nluc could be measured within 24 h postinfection. Furthermore, we found that A72 cells derived from canine fibroblasts permitted FCoV replication without apparent cytopathic effects. Thus, our reporter virus is useful for uncovering the infectivity of type I FCoV in different cell lines, including canine-derived cells. Surprisingly, we uncovered aberrant viral RNA transcription of rC3663 in A72 cells. Overall, we succeeded in obtaining infectious cDNA clones derived from type I FCoV that retained its virulence. Our recombinant FCoVs are powerful tools for increasing our understanding of the viral life cycle and pathogenesis of FIP-inducing type I FCoV.",

Tissue culture-adapted type I FCoV often loses pathogenicity, which complicates research on type I FCoV-induced feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Since we previously found that type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently induces FIP in specificpathogen-free cats, we established a reverse genetics system for the C3663 strain to obtain recombinant viruses in the present study. By using a reporter C3663 virus, we were able to examine the inhibitory effect of 68 compounds on C3663 replication in Fcwf-4 cells and infectivity in a canine-derived cell line. Interestingly, one canine cell line, A72, permitted FCoV replication but with low efficiency and aberrant viral gene expression.",

We produced rC3663 virus from Fcwf-4 cells, which are highly susceptible to FCoV infection, by transfecting the cells with pBAC-FCoV-C3663. Low levels of cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed at 2 days posttransfection (dpt), and the levels became higher by 3 dpt. To determine the rates of rC3663 virus recovery, we employed reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) on isolated RNA from rC3663 and the parental strain. We further confirmed the \u0394EcoRI genetic maker by analyzing EcoRI digestion and Sanger sequencing ( Fig. 1C and D) . Next, we analyzed the virological features of the rC3663 virus by comparing the growth The full-length C3663 sequence was divided into 11 fragments (Fr1 to Fr11), and each fragment was sequentially assembled into the plasmid backbone.

Furthermore, we compared levels of viral RNA replication in parental C3663-infected and rC3663-infected Fcwf-4 cells by Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 1F ) and found that the amounts of genomic RNA (gRNA) and of sg mRNAs in rC3663-infected Fcwf-4 cells were similar to those seen with the parental C3663-infected cells (Fig. 1F ). Taking the results together, we were able to successfully generate infectious cDNA clones derived from type I FCoV strain C3663 using the BAC system.

Before application of the rC3663 reporter virus to compound screening, we determined the sensitivity of the rC3663-Nluc virus to treatment with known inhibitors of CoV replication, namely, cyclosporine (CsA) (27, 28) and lopinavir (29) . After adsorption of rC3663-Nluc onto Fcwf-4 cells at an MOI of 0.01, the infected cells were treated with various concentrations of CsA or lopinavir. As shown in Fig. 2D and E, both compounds inhibited luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, viral RNA levels in CsA-treated or lopinavir-treated cells were measured by real-time RT-PCR ( Fig. 2D and E). Dose-dependent reductions of intracellular viral RNA levels were found for both compounds and were correlated with luciferase activity, suggesting that the sensitivity of detection of luciferase expression levels in rC3663-Nluc-infected cells is comparable to that of viral RNA expression levels.",

Fcwf-4 cells were inoculated with rC3663-Nluc (MOI \u03ed 0.01), and 10 M concentrations of each protease inhibitor with CsA and with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The side-effects of protease inhibitors were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays (Fig. 2F) Fig. 2E . Overall, our results support the idea of the suitability of rC3663-Nluc for compound screening. Identification of permissive cell lines for type I FCoV. In vitro propagation of type I FCoV is limited to a few cell lines, including Fcwf-4 cells, AKD cells, and CRFK cells, because type I FCoV shows a CPE only in such cell lines (23, 30, 31) . Thus, it is difficult to investigate the infectivity of type I FCoV in cell lines derived from other animals, such as dogs. Nevertheless, we explored novel cell lines for propagation of type I FCoV by inoculating three canine-derived cell lines, A72 (canine fibroblasts), MDCK (canine kidney epithelial cells), and DH82 (canine macrophages), with the rC3663-Nluc virus (MOI \u03ed 0.1) and investigated infectivity by measuring Nluc activity. Although no CPE was observed for rC3663-Nluc-infected A72 cells, Nluc activity was significantly high at 24 hpi and increased in a time-dependent manner ( Fig. 3A and C) . On the other hand, rC3663-Nluc-infected MDCK and DH82 cells did not exhibit detectable Nluc activity (Fig. 3B ).",

Using an anti-FCoV N monoclonal antibody (MAb), N protein expression in A72 cells was observed by IFA, and the A72 cells exhibited small foci at 48 hpi compared with those exhibited by Fcwf-4 cells (Fig. 3F) . Therefore, infectious particles were found to have been generated in A72 cells at a low efficiency of infection expansion by progeny particles to neighboring cells. We also examined N protein expression levels using immunoblotting. As expected, N protein expression levels in rC3663 virusinfected A72 cells were significantly low (Fig. 3G ). Although the levels of production of progeny virus and N protein were low, our results suggest that canine-derived A72 cells represent a permissive cell line for type I FCoV infections without cytotoxic effects. Fig. 3 , and unlike the results seen with A72 cells, neither viral RNA replication nor progeny virus production was observed in MDCK and DH82 cells infected with rC3663 virus. These results led us to speculate that the entry receptor for type I FCoV is perhaps not expressed in MDCK and DH82 cells or that viral RNA replication of type I FCoV is not permitted in these cell lines. Unfortunately, the type I FCoV receptor remains unknown. Thus, we examined viral replication levels in cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc. As a negative control, we generated pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead by mutating the active site of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12) from SDD to SAA (Fig. 4A ) and confirmed that virus rescue did not occur in Fcwf-4 cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead because of disrupted RdRp activity (data not shown). After transfecting MDCK cells with pBAC-FCoV-C3663- Fig. 3G , expression levels of N protein in infected A72 cells were significantly low. Thus, to determine expression levels of sg N mRNA (sg mRNA6), total RNAs extracted from rC3663 virus-infected or mock-infected Fcwf-4 and A72 cells at 48 and 72 hpi were subjected to Northern blot analysis with a specific type I FCoV 3= untranslated region (3=UTR) probe (Fig. 5A) . We found that all viral RNAs, including gRNA and sg mRNA2 to mRNA7, were detected in Fcwf-4 cells infected with rC3663 virus (Fig. 5A) . However, the expression levels of gRNA and sg mRNA2 to mRNA5 were significantly lower in infected A72 cells than in infected Fcwf-4 cells (Fig. 5A) .",

However, experimental confirmation of the presence of a virulent factor(s) is difficult in vivo due to the lack of a feasible FIP cat model of type I FCoV. Recently, we found that type I FCoV strain C3663 has the ability to induce FIP in SPF cats (9) . Thus, in the present study, we constructed an infectious cDNA clone derived from the virulence-retaining type I FCoV strain C3663 by utilizing the BAC system. As a result, we successfully rescued recombinant type I FCoV by transfection of the BAC cDNA clone into Fcwf-4 cells, where the recovered rC3663 showed growth kinetics similar to that of the parental virus (Fig. 1 ). In addition, we generated recombinant type I FCoV carrying Nluc as a reporter gene and applied our reporter rC3663 virus to drug screening (Fig. 2) .",

If chemical compounds can suppress the viral load of type I FCoV in kittens, then the probability of disease onset should be reduced.

Feline aminopeptidase N (APN) works as a viral receptor for type II CCoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (15, 49) , suggesting that cats, and especially kittens, play an important role in producing new chimeric viruses. However, the possibility of recombination in other animals, such as dogs, has not been well-studied. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no reports have shown type I FCoV induction of apparent CPE in cell culture except for Fcwf-4 cells. Indeed, the C3663 strain of type I FCoV did not exhibit CPE in canine-derived cells (Fig. 3C) . However, the level of luciferase activity in A72 cells infected with the rC3663-Nluc virus was significantly increased without concomitant CPE ( Fig. 3A and C) , and although the progeny virus production levels were low, A72 cells permitted type I FCoV replication (Fig. 3D) . We reasoned that investigations of type I FCoV infectivity in other cell lines should not rely solely on CPE-based assays. Furthermore, our findings indicate that events of recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV may occur in dogs. Specifically, type I FCoV may be transmitted from cats to dogs and a new CoV may emerge in dogs through recombination events. In fact, CCoV replicates in A72 cells (50) .",

To our knowledge, there are no reports on aberrant RNA transcription of CoVs in infected cells, such as in A72 cells. Several host proteins, such as members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family or the DEAD box RNA helicase family, interact with the TRS of CoV RNA and regulate transcription/replication (60) . Thus, our data indicate that a host factor(s) present in Fcwf-4 cells, but not in A72 cells, regulates viral RNA transcription.

Our recombinant virus can potentially be used to expand research on type I FCoV-induced FIP. Furthermore, infection of the A72 cells with the rC3663 virus revealed unusual viral mRNA expression patterns that may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of CoV transcription. Although further study is required to test whether the recombinant virus can induce FIP in vivo, our established type I FCoV clone has the potential to be a powerful tool for understanding FIP pathogenesis. For example, because the S gene is a candidate for FCoV pathogenesis (19, 20) , a chimeric S gene virus corresponding to our recombinant virus may provide novel insights into type I FCoV pathogenesis. Additionally, other groups have previously established type I FCoV reverse genetics using the Black strain (26) and type I field virus (61); thus, exploiting multiple approaches can synergistically further our understanding of FIP.",

The BAC DNA of SARS-CoV-Rep (67) was kindly provided by Luis Enjuanes (Spanish National Center for Biotechnology [CNB-CSIC], Madrid, Spain) and was used as a backbone BAC sequence to generate infectious cDNA carrying the full-length type I FCoV strain C3663 sequence. The full-length genomic sequence of C3663 was divided into 11 fragments that were then assembled into pBeloBAC11 plasmids in sequential order (Fig. 1A) . Fragments Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, Fr4, Fr5, Fr6, Fr7, Fr8, Fr9, Fr10, and Fr11 correspond to nt 11218 to 13811, nt 13812 to 16360, nt 16361 to 18675, nt 18676 to 20998, nt 20999 to 23400, nt 23401 to 26227, nt 9210 to 11217, nt 26228 to 28545, nt 1 to 2069, nt 2070 to 5152, and nt 5153 to 9834, respectively. Red/ET recombination was employed for fragment integration with a Red/ET recombination system counterselection BAC modification kit (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (32) . The cDNA corresponding to the 3= end of the genomic RNA between nt 28046 and 28545 with 25 nt of adenine (pA) and a partial HDV ribozyme (Rz) sequence was generated by chemical synthesis (Eurofins, Brussels, Belgium); this cDNA was used as a PCR template for synthesizing Fr8 (Fig. 1A) . For synthesizing other fragments, RT-PCR was carried out using genomic RNA of the C3663 strain as described under \"RNA extraction and RT-PCR\" (see below). For Fr11 amplification, reverse primer YT648 (5=-TTTGCCTTATAACTTCCGTAGGTGTAAACTCATCACATAATGAGCCA TAAGACA-3=) was designed to disrupt the EcoRI site of C3663 between nt 9829 and nt 9834 (Fig. 1B) . The cDNA clone carrying the full-length C3663 sequence was designated pBAC-FCoV-C3663. Sequence analysis of the full-genome sequence of C3663 in pBAC-FCoV-C3663 was carried out by Eurofins. For construction of reporter rC3663, we replaced the ORF 3abc genes of pBAC-FCoV-C3663 with Nluc (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) using the recombination method described above ( Fig. 2A) and designated the infectious cDNA clone pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc. The same recombination method was applied for the construction of pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead, which possesses amino acid substitutions (SDD to SAA) at the active site of RdRp (nsp12; Fig. 4A ).",

Nluc or pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead together with pcDNA3.1-fluc, we determined the levels of luciferase activity in cell lysates at 24, 48, and 72 h posttransfection (Fig. 4B, with firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pcDNA3.1-fluc (32) used as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 4B, Nluc expression levels in cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc were comparable to those in cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc-PolDead. Consistent with the luciferase assay results(Fig. 4B), no progeny virus was produced in MDCK cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc(Fig. 4C). In addition, no increases in the levels of viral RNA(Fig. 4D) or N protein expression(Fig. 4E)were observed in MDCK cells transfected with pBAC-FCoV-C3663-Nluc.
