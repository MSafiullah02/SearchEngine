            "text": "The start of the new millennium is marked by two emerging infectious diseases coming from wild game food animals and poultry.1, 2 Both SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and avian influenza A H5N1 virus predominantly manifest as acute community acquired pneumonia with no response to empirical treatment by antibacterials covering typical and atypical agents.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 SARS-CoV and avian influenza A H5N1 pneumonia are associated with significant mortality.7, 8, 9 Unfortunately, few prospective studies have been performed with documentation of the virus load changes during the course of illness for any respiratory viral pneumonia.8, 10 The literature on the histological changes or pathogenesis of this condition is scarce. No randomized placebo-controlled treatment trial has ever been conducted. Such lack of data was often attributed to the lack of rapid diagnostic tests and effective antivirals. During the SARS outbreak, the empirical use of ribavirin and steroids were regarded as controversial.11, 12, 13, 14 Due to the explosive nature of the outbreak, randomized controlled trials on treatment could not be organized. Therefore, we attempt to review the literature on the rationale and strategy used in the treatment of acute community acquired viral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. Virus load data and serological changes of acute respiratory viral pneumonia available in the literature, as well as from our SARS patients were included in this analysis.",

However, similar to other causes of viral pneumonia, little information on the virus load changes with respect to treatment was systematically reported. Therefore, laboratory data from our cohort of 152 SARS patients who fulfilled the modified WHO definition were retrieved.5 Virus load was measured on nasopharyngeal, serum, stool and urine specimens taken between day 10 and 15 after symptom onset. Part of these data was previously reported.8, 10, 15, 16 The virus load results were correlated with the specific antiviral regimens, namely ribavirin with and without lopinavir/ritonavir for SARS. Serial quantitative RT-PCRs and IgG titers of SARS-CoV were performed in 12 randomly selected patients who were treated with ribavirin and corticosteroid on day 5, 10, 15 and 20 after onset of symptoms. To compare the serial virus load and antibody seroconversion with other respiratory virus infections, the English-language literature was searched to identify studies with detailed description of serial virus load and antibody titers during the course of infection.",

Except for 13 (1.5%) patients who were treated conservatively, antiviral therapy and/or immunomodulating therapy were given in all other patients. Of 772 patients receiving specific antiviral therapy and/or immunomodulating therapy, 675 (87.4%) were treated with ribavirin containing regimens and 44 (5.7%) were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir containing regimens during the initial phase of the disease. Immunomodulating therapy without antiviral agents was initiated in 53 of 772 (6.9%) patients. Recombinant interferon alpha, corticosteroid, and a combination of interferon alfacon-1 and corticosteroid were used in 30 (3.9%), 14 (1.8%) and 9 (1.2%) cases, respectively. Of the 64 patients receiving treatment during clinical deterioration, ribavirin or oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and convalescent plasma were given as rescue medical therapy in 32 (50%), 31 (48.4%) and 1 (1.6%), respectively. High dose pulse methylprednisolone was used during clinical deterioration such as oxygen desaturation, worsening of radiographic infiltrates in the chest, recurrent fever without evidence of nosocomial sepsis in some reports. However, the number of patients requiring pulse steroids was not mentioned in most of them.5, 8, 10, 59, 60, 61, 62 Furthermore, IVIG, thymic peptides, and recombinant human thymus proteins were used in some patients but the clinical details were not sufficient for any meaningful analysis.61 The overall mortality was 7.7% in these 849 SARS cases. No obvious difference was noted irrespective of whether the patients were treated by ribavirin with or without corticosteroids, corticosteroids alone, or recombinant interferon-alpha given on admission or during deterioration. However, the mortality is only 2.3% in a group of 44 patients treated by lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids,64 and 0% for nine patients treated with interferon alfacon-1 and corticosteroids.65 Only one patient received convalescent plasma as rescue therapy.67\n",

There was no significant relationship between virus load, age, and the presence of co-morbidities. However, significant decreases in virus load were observed when lopinavir/ritonavir was added to ribavirin (Table 3). It is also interesting to note that stool virus load is significantly higher in males (7.0 vs. 5.5 log10 copies/ml, P=0.02), whereas that of the urine is significantly higher in females (1.6 vs. 0.6 log10 copies/ml, P=0.01). Of the 111 (73%) historical controls treated with ribavirin and corticosteroids, 12 randomly selected patients had serial virus load studies performed on their nasopharyngeal specimens; their mean virus loads were 5.2, 7.3, 4.9 and 3.8 log10 copies/ml at day 5, 10, 15 and 20 after onset of symptoms, respectively (Fig. 1\n). The decline in virus load in nasopharyngeal specimens coincided with the appearance of IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV during the course of infection (Fig. 2\n). Since similar clinical studies of other respiratory viral pneumonias were not available in the literature except for a naturally occurring case of influenza,73 another 12 cases of experimental infection with RSV by artificial inoculation into healthy volunteers were adopted for comparison (Fig. 2).74 The virus load of influenza A virus and RSV peaked at day 2 and 3, respectively, whereas that of SARS-CoV occurred at day 10 after onset of symptoms (Fig. 1). As for the antibody response, baseline antibodies of influenza A virus and RSV were detectable in serum and nasal washings but antibodies against SARS-CoV were not present until day 10 after symptom onset.",

Well-documented treatment regimens by randomized control trials are only available for HIV, HCV, HBV, HSV, VZV, CMV and human influenza without pneumonia.78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93 Moreover, in vitro susceptibility of viruses may not correlate with clinical efficacy, as in the case of interferon-alpha used for the treatment of genital herpes.94 No improvement in symptoms score or duration of genital lesions was found irrespective of whether systemic or topical interferon-alpha was used.95 In the case of acute RSV bronchiolitis, the efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin was also questionable.96, 97\n",

The present literature review suggests that at least in the case of human influenza A virus and hantavirus pneumonia, steroid therapy alone may improve the outcome.20, 21, 22, 52, 53 In the case of VZV pneumonia, the absence of mortality in cases treated with the addition of steroid to an efficacious antiviral agent such as acyclovir seems to support such an approach.28, 29, 39, 40, 41 Despite some decrease in mortality in patients (47.7% vs. 63.4%), ribavirin is not considered as an effective antiviral for hantavirus.51, 52, 53, 54, 55 However, the use of steroids during the phase of severe ARDS of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome may be associated with reduction in mortality (13.3% vs. 63.4%).52, 53 As emphasized by a group reporting on a cluster of adenoviral pneumonia, the use of high dose steroids without an effective antiviral may actually increase mortality.47 However the number of adenoviral pneumonia treated by steroids is too small to justify such a conclusion. Overall, the dosage and duration of steroid therapy for viral pneumonia were extremely heterogenous, future randomized clinical studies should be conducted to ascertain the dosage and duration of steroids associated with the least complication which includes secondary infection and avascular necrosis of bone.",

            "text": "Another difficulty in the management of viral pneumonia is the early peaking of the virus load which leaves a narrow window of opportunity for antiviral treatment.73, 74 In both human influenza A and RSV, the virus loads peaked at around 2\u20133 days after symptom onset in natural and experimental infections of healthy adults (Fig. 1).73, 74 The early control of virus load in these two infections may be explained by the brisk antibody response, possibly due to previous antigenic exposure (Fig. 2).73, 74 A completely different picture emerges in the case of SARS. The virus load in SARS patients peaked at around day 10 with a very large area under the curve when compared with those of human influenza A virus and RSV (Fig. 1). The onset of antibody response was also delayed and started to appear at around day 10. The failure of innate immunity and the relatively delayed onset of adaptive antibody response to control virus replication may be the explanations for the high mortality of this infection. Our previous studies showed that mortality is directly related to the virus load in nasopharyngeal specimens on admission and at day 10.16, 98 The mortality was also correlated with the number of RT-PCR positive specimens from different body sites including nasopharyngeal, serum, stool, or urine.98 Therefore, an effective antiviral which could reduce the peak virus load and area under the curve is the key to the successful treatment of SARS and perhaps avian influenza A H5N1 virus, since the general population has no immunological memory towards these two viruses.",

It may also switch the immune response of mice from a T-helper-2 to a T-helper-1 response,100 which is beneficial for most intracellular infection. Subsequently in vitro susceptibility testing suggests that antiviral effect could only be achieved at a very high concentration which is difficult to achieve clinically,101 despite the fact that ribavirin is known to be concentrated in some cell lines such as African green monkey kidney (Vero 76) and mouse 3T3 cells.102 Moreover, the use of high dose regimens indicated for the treatment of haemorrhagic fever was associated with significant hemolysis.12, 72 Thus other options were diligently searched during the epidemic. Lopinavir/ritonavir was then used in addition to ribavirin because of a weak in vitro antiviral activity on the prototype SARS-CoV.10 The checkerboard assay demonstrated synergisim between lopinavir and ribavirin at a low viral inoculum.10 Other reports suggested that glycyrrhizin, interferon beta (Betaferon), interferon alpha n\u22121 (Wellferon), interferon alpha n\u22123 (Alferon), leucocytic interferon alpha, and baicalin may also have in vitro activity.101, 103, 104, 105 However, interferons were not considered by most clinicians during the epidemic because of their known proinflammatory activity, which may potentiate the inflammatory damage initiated by the viral infection, and the reported side effects of interstitial pneumonitis and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.106 Subsequently pegylated recombinant interferon alpha 2b was shown to be effective as pre-exposure and perhaps very early postexposure prophylaxis in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) experimentally infected with SARS-CoV.107 Though different preparations of interferons appeared to be effective in vitro, only recombinant interferon alpha and interferon alfacon-1 has been used in SARS patients.61, 65 Moreover it is still early to suggest which interferon is likely to be effective in human trial because contradictory reports on the in vitro susceptibility tests were reported for interferon beta 1a101, 108 and interferon alpha 2b.101, 109\n",
