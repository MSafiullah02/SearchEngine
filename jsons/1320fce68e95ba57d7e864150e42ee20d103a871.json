In addition, 2 ungrouped viruses, Paramushir (L'vov et al. 1975) and Runde (Traavik et al. 1977) , have been isolated from I. uriae. To study the presence of arboviruses in I. uriae ' This study was supported in part by grants from the Nordic Collegium for Terrestrial Ecology, the Finnish State Medical Board, by traineeship No. 2TOI-GM00005-16 EBA from the United States Public Health Service and by grants from the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (DADA-17-72-C-2170), U.S. Navy (N000014-78-C-OI04), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (PHS-ROI-AI10984), the World Health Organization, Yale University, and the Rockefeller Foundation. This paper was presented at the 2nd International Symposium on Arctic Arboviruses, Mt. Gabriel, Canada, 1977.

Detailed descriptions of the study area have been published elsewhere (Wagner 1958 , Pomeroy 1966 . The area is a breeding place for about 2 million pairs of birds, of which the Atlantic Puffin, Fratercula arctica, Black-legged Kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla, Common Murre, Uria aalge, and Razorbill, Alca torda, are the prevalent species. Unengorged female ticks were found in the active foraging state; unengorged males, engorged nymphs and larvae were collected from crevices in stones or from soil under the bird colonies. Ticks were transported on ice to the laboratory where they were kept alive up to 6 months at 6\u00b0or 15\u00b0C until isolation attempts were made. Engorged specimens were allowed to molt. Ticks were triturated in pools averaging 5 adults or 20 nymphs and were inoculated into 0-to 3-day-old mice (Brummer-Korvenkontio et al. 1973) . Negative pools were further tested in chick embryo cell cultures (Saikku 1974) . Presumptive identification of isolates by negative-staining electron microscopy was done with cell culture supernatant or by touching the wet cut surface of the mouse brain with a grid that was then stained with uranyl acetate (pH 5.8) or sodium phosphotungstate (pH 7.0). Preliminary serological typing was done by complement fixation with crude, 2nd-or 3rd-passage suckling mouse brain extracts centrifuged at 10,000 g for 60 min as antigens. The following sera or immune ascitic fluids were used: Uukuniemi group isolate from Rpst (NorAr V-697), Great Island (CanAr 41) of the Kemerovo Group, polyvalent Sakhalin group and group B.",

Males, which do not feed, and engorged larvae and nymphs were found tightly packed in crevices in the rocks. Virus was not isolated from unengorged adult ticks that apparently had overwintered. This is compatable with the hypothesis that an arbovirus in a hibernating vector can go into an \"invertebrate\" cycle in which the virus is difficult to detect in vertebrates or in vertebrate cells at higher temperatures (Schlesinger 1975) . Evidence of this phenomenon has been presented in studies on transovarial transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in mosquitoes (Rosen et aI. 1978) . The easily detected isolates from engorged and molted ticks in our studies may be due to recently acquired virus of the \"vertebrate\" type, to alterations in tick physiology during feeding and molting, or to exposure during engorgement to the body temperature of the bird. The isolates, although not proven arboviruses, were recovered from molted ticks and thus were maintained and passed transstadially in I. uriae.",

Viruses of the Kemerovo and Sakhalin groups, but not the Uukuniemi group, were isolated from I. uriae in eastern Canada and the Faeroe Islands (Main et aI. 1976a, b) , despite similar host species and connecting bird migratory pathways between the Faeroe Islands and Lofoten.
