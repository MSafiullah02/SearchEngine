More than 500 prescriptions contain LJF for treatment of carbuncles, furuncles, erysipelas, sores, swelling and affections caused by exopathogenic wind\u2010heat, epidemic febrile diseases at the early period.1 Modern pharmacological research has confirmed its high medicinal value, such as anti\u2010inflammatory,2, 3, 4 anti\u2010bacterial,5 anti\u2010oxidant,6 hepatoprotective,7 anti\u2010viral8 and other biological activities. Meanwhile, clinical practice in recent years also showed LJF possesses a preventive effect on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and H1N1 influenza virus.9, 10 In China, there is a notion of \u201cLet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food\u201d. LJF and LF also have been used to make tea, food, and beverages due to their heat\u2010clearing and health care properties.",

Cheng in current Chinese Pharmacopoeia. They are typical Chinese medicines of \u201cheterologous effect\u201d. Numerous literature has reported that LF has similar pharmacological activities as LJF,8, 11 only with a marginal difference in the strength of the drug effect. But until now, there is still no recognised theory to explain this phenomenon. Therefore, owing to the close proximity of plant species, the similar appearance and function, the quality standards and mutual substitution of LF and LJF still remain controversial.",

            "text": "Chemical composition is the basis of the pharmacological action of medicinal materials. In recent years, phytochemical studies have revealed that more than 200 components have been identified from L. japonica, its main constituents include essential oils, flavonoids, organic acid, iridoids and saponins,12, 13 which modulate multiple functions. For instance, the volatile oil possesses antifungal activity; flavonoids and organic acid have strong inhibitory activity against multiple pathogens,14 anti\u2010oxidant, and anti\u2010tumour;15 iridoids and saponins also have shown excellent activity of anti\u2010tumour, anti\u2010inflammation, antioxidant and hepatoprotective;16 amino acid is an essential nutrient that is beneficial to human body; it exhibits a variety of physiological activities, including anti\u2010platelet aggregation, antioxidant and immunity enhancement;17 nucleosides are the major components of nucleic acids. Some nucleosides and their derivatives have significant physiological functions, for example inosine can be used to treat acute and chronic hepatitis, rheumatic heart disease.18 Therefore, it is certain that excellent clinical efficacy arises from the synergistic effects of complicated chemical components. In Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 edition, chlorogenic acid and luteoloside have been used as biomarkers to characterise the quality of LJF. Notably, some other medicinal plants have also been found to contain high contents of chlorogenic acid and luteoloside, and to determine single or several bioactive compounds in herbal medicines is one\u2010sided with respect to the wholeness of TCM meaning multi\u2010components at multi\u2010targets. Only chlorogenic acid and luteoloside might not completely inflect the quality of LJF, and owing to the mixing of different medicinal parts, unconsciously mislabelled or confused of LJF and LF, the quality and safety of LJF and LF cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, an effective and reliable method is necessary to be established to evaluate the quality of LJF and LF. Meanwhile, it is meaningful to find the distinguishing chemical markers and identify which part (the flower bud or the flower) is the optimum quality of LJF.",

For instance, high\u2010performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detector (HPLC\u2010UV) was used for determination of phenolic acid;19, 20, 21 HPLC with evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC\u2010ELSD) was employed for quantitative saponins and iridoid glucosides.22, 23, 24 Nevertheless, the earlier methods only could detect an individual active ingredient which made the assay less efficient. HPLC\u2010diode array detector (DAD)\u2010ELSD25, 26 was reported to detect flavonoids, iridoids, phenolic acids, and saponins in LJF and LF. However, there are still several shortcomings such as the relatively low sensitivity of ELSD and the inaccuracy of chromatographic peaks only determined by retention time. With the development of analytical technology, HPLC\u2010DAD\u2010electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI\u2010MS) was proposed to analyse multiple types of bioactive constituents.27, 28 It has been reported that HPLC\u2010ESI\u2010time\u2010of\u2010flight (TOF)\u2010MS was used to quantify 32 bioactive compounds in Lonicera species.29 But these methods mainly focus on quantification. Nowadays, ultra\u2010fast liquid chromatography\u2010tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UFLC\u2010QTRAP\u2010MS/MS) has been used to identify the content of TCM due to its high sensitivity and informativity.30, 31\n",

This method could simultaneously detect 50 constituents, including 12 organic acids, 12 flavonoids, 6 iridoids, 3 saponins, 13 amino acids and 4 nucleosides in 35 batches of LJF and LF samples from different habitats and commercial herbs. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS\u2010DA) was performed to distinguish the LJF and LF. Grey relational analysis (GRA) was introduced to assess the quality of LJF and LF according to the contents of the tested constituents. Our study not only established a method of simultaneous determination of multiple bioactive constituents of LJF and LF, but provided comprehensive information on the quality control of them. The developed method is conducive to distinguish orthologues or paralogues of them, and provide the support for \u201cheterologous effects\u201d.

Considering the strong hydrophilicity of organic acids, amino acids and nucleosides, the column of X Bridge \u00aeC18 (4.6 mm \u00d7 100 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm) was chosen. Water/acetonitrile system showed more powerful resolution than water/methanol system. Furthermore, when the mobile phase was added with formic acid, the shape and symmetry of chromatographic peak of organic acids were significantly improved. In addition, the column temperature also affects the chromatographic separation. As a result, 0.2% aqueous formic acid/0.2% formic acid acetonitrile at the flow rate of 0.8 mL/min at 30\u00b0C on X Bridge \u00aeC18 (4.6 mm \u00d7 100 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm) was selected and applied.",

The contents of protocatechuic acid, rutin, loganin, and morroniside were too low to be detected in LF. The flavonoids of luteoloside, lonicerin, kaempferol\u20103\u2010O\u2010rutinoside and the iridoids of sweroside, secologanic acid were also in low contents compared with LJF.

Among them, dipsacoside B reached up to 70687.6 \u03bcg/g, therefore, it was considered as a characteristic component of LF in current Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Content percentages of six types of component (organic acids, flavonoids, iridoids, saponins, amino acids, and nucleosides) in 35 batches of samples are shown in Figure 2. The results indicated that the contents have a significant variation in different samples. It is clear that the bioactive components of organic acids account for the largest proportion. Noteworthy, the literature33, 34 also suggest that phenolic acids are regarded as one of the main anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010bacterial active ingredients. This conclusion might explain the efficacy of \u201cqing\u2010re\u2010jie\u2010du\u201d of LJF and LF.

LJF was distributed over the PC1 negative axis; LF was scattered in the PC1 positive axis. Furthermore, the PC1 and PC2 described 69.3% and 13.8% of variability between samples, respectively. This indicated that LJF and LF were significantly different in chemical composition. PLS\u2010DA was used to extend to find out the constituents contributing to the differences between LJF and LF. In the PLS\u2010DA scores plot (Figure 3b), LJF and LF were separated into two clusters; the flower buds and flowers of LJF also were divided. The flowers were distributed over the PC2 positive axis, the flower buds were mostly scattered in the PC2 negative axis. In the plot PLS\u2010DA loading (Figure 3c) and the variable influence on projection (VIP) (Figure 3d), the large load value (VIP > 1) can be regarded as a marker component that contributes greatly to the classification of these samples. l\u2010Proline, l\u2010serine, l\u2010glutamate, chlorogenic acid, 1,3\u2010O\u2010dicaffeoylquinic acid, protocatechuic acid, secoxyloganin, secologanic acid, morroniside, macranthoidin A and dipsacoside B could be considered as chemical markers for the sample classification.",

A total number of 50 constituents, including 12 organic acids, 12 flavonoids, 6 iridoids, 3 saponins, 13 amino acids, and 4 nucleosides were simultaneously assayed in LJF and LF. Using either PCA or PLS\u2010DA, it was clear to differentiate LJF and LF, and the sample classification is closely related to 11 different chemical constituents, such as, l\u2010proline, l\u2010serine, l\u2010glutamate, chlorogenic acid, 1,3\u2010O\u2010dicaffeoylquinic acid, protocatechuic acid, secoxyloganin, secologanic acid, morroniside, macranthoidin A and dipsacoside B. The GRA assay and the data of content determination also demonstrated the quality of LJF was better than that of LF, and that of the flower buds was superior to the flowers. Therefore, we suggest that LJF should be harvested at the bud stage in order to improve the clinical medicinal value. In addition, organic acids were the main components in LJF and LF. Overall, our study not only established a method of simultaneous determination of multiple types of bioactive constituents of LJF and LF, but provided comprehensive information on the quality control of them. The developed method is conducive to distinguish orthologues or paralogues of them, and provide the support for \u201cheterologous effects\u201d.",
