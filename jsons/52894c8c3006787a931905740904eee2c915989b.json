This public health concern has been boosted by the recent outbreaks of EV-D68 infection in the United States (http://www.cdc. gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks. html). Outbreaks associated with novel EV-D68 have also been reported during 2006-2012 in China (2, 3) . However, since 2012, no EV-D68 infections in China have been reported. Whether the EV-D68 outbreaks in the United States affected those in China is unclear. Continuous characterization of EV-D68 epidemics is therefore necessary for purposes of early alert and for facilitating control measure decisions.",

The System covers 30 sentinel hospitals in all 16 districts of Beijing. We obtained 1,478 clinical specimens (1,034 nasopharyngeal swab and 444 sputum). Patient ages ranged from 8 months to 93 years (median 33.5 years, mean 37.9 years). Enteroviruses and other known respiratory viruses were detected by real-time PCR (4) . A total of 70 enterovirus-positive samples were identified. Other respiratory viruses detected were 89 rhinoviruses, 87 influenza viruses, 70 human parainfluenza viruses (types 1-4), 43 human coronaviruses, 26 respiratory syncytial viruses, 29 adenoviruses, 9 bocaviruses, and 2 metapneumoviruses.

Beijing-R0132 was clustered with most of the EV-D68 strains that circulated throughout the United States during 2014. The strains identified from Beijing in 2008, represented by BCH895A/2008, belong to another distinct lineage according to genome phylogeny ( Figure, panel A) . Similar relationships were observed in the phylogenic tree of the VP1 gene (Figure, panel B) . Beijing-R0132 and some EV-D68 strains from China identified in 2011 grouped with most of the strains obtained from the United States in 2014.

This Beijing-R0132 genome sequence provides information for tracking EV-D68 as it spreads throughout the world and for evaluating the sequence diversity in circulating EV-D68 strains. In contrast to EV-D68 detection during the outbreaks in the United States, positive detection of EV-D68 in this study was limited, although the circulating virus strains were closely related. The reason for this disparity warrants further investigation. However, the severe pneumonia caused by EV-D68 reported here underlies the need for intensive attention to surveillance and control of EV-D68 in vulnerable populations, such as young children. In addition, for a megacity with very high population density and mobility, such as Beijing, the citywide implementation of the Respiratory Virus Surveillance System is critical for monitoring the epidemic or potential outbreaks of EV-D68 and other respiratory viruses and for enabling early warning.",

Phylogenetic analysis of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) from different locations. The phylogenetic relationships of all complete or near-complete EV-D68 genomes (A) or representative viral protein 1 sequences from different countries (B) were estimated by using the maximum-likelihood method with 100 replicates bootstrapped by using MEGA (http://www.megasoftware.net). Bootstrap values were indicated on each tree. EV-D68 strains from China are indicated with an asterisk. GenBank accession numbers are shown for each EV-D68 strain. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. determined by using the RACE System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each amplicon was sequenced 4 times by using the Sanger method, and the forward and reverse sequences agreed well. Sequences were assembled by using DNA-Star software (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA) and deposited in GenBank (accession no. KP240936). The genome of Beijing-R0132 was 7,334 nt long, including 699 nt in 5\u2032-untranslated regions (5\u2032-UTRs), 6,567 nt in open reading frame (ORF), and 68 nt in 3\u2032-UTR. Beijing-R0132 shared 96% nt sequence identity with the virus circulating in the United States in 2014, US/CO/14-60. In contrast to the prototype EV-D68 (Fermon strain, AY426531), deletions of the CTCAAAACCTCCAGTACATAACA sequence in the 5\u2032-UTR and TTATTTATAACA sequence in the front of the ORF of Beijing-R0132 were observed, corresponding with nt 682-704, and nt 721-732 of the Fermon strain, which were similar to those identified in the United States in 2014.",
