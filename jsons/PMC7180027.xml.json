            "text": "Second, behavior change requires not only verbal recommendations, but also real interventions in the environment and even legislation. Lunn et al. point out that it is not enough to advise individuals to wash hands and cough in the elbow. It is just as important to change the environment in a way that facilitates the new behavior, in this case for instance by placing alcohol-based hand sanitizer (AHS) in highly visible locations [10]. Moreover, it is important not only to say \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d, but rather to replace one behavior with another and make the behavior easy, for instance by building it into existing behavioral routines. The norm of not shaking hands as part of social distancing e.g., may lead to awkward, uncomfortable situations as we have to change routines. Demonstrations on TV by role models of touching elbows or a Japanese style bow or nod of the head are examples of suggesting an easy, alternative behavior for shaking hand. This will increase self-efficacy, which is an important determinant of behavior change. Restrictive legislation may also be required. It is interesting to see that the road of restrictive legislation is increasingly being used to promote health behavior change. This route is observed in recent years in the prevention of smoking and also now used in many countries to reinforce adherence to social distancing.",

The attitude and behavior of leaders at all levels are important. For instance, in Norway politicians appeal to the Norwegian tradition of \u201cdugnad\u201d, a word for joint action on family or community level. In several countries politicians and heads of state have given national speeches acknowledging how the pandemic creates fear, and with appeals to solidarity and shared responsibilities. A demonstration of concern from role models may have a role in persuading the public to adhere to recommendations.",

It is important to acknowledge that transition of initiation of behavior to maintenance requires a change in the self-regulation of the behavior. Behavior initiation requires intentional behavior planning whereas maintenance becomes more habitual and requires less self-regulation. Self-efficacy is relevant in the motivational phase of behavior, when behavior intentions are being formulated. To initiate a new health behavior, individuals must be confident in their ability and skills to perform that behavior (action self-efficacy). To maintain behavior, individuals must be repetitive in their performance of the desired behaviors and confident in their ability to overcome barriers in order to continue that behavior (maintenance self-efficacy).",

For some patients, the physical impact both of the disease itself and invasive treatment can be huge. A study by Udelsman et al. among older, higher-risk patients presenting for elective procedures showed that most patients chose limitations to life-sustaining treatments [23]. This finding highlights the need for in-depth goals of care discussion and establishment of advance care preferences before any procedure or operative intervention, preferable even before one is affected with COVID-19.",
