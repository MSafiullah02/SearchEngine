The Above Local Elevated Respiratory Illness Threshold (ALERT) algorithm uses a threshold-based approach to suggest incidence levels that historically have indicated the transition from endemic to epidemic activity. In this paper, we present the first detailed overview of the computational approach underlying the algorithm. In the motivating example section, we evaluate the performance of ALERT in determining the onset of increased respiratory virus incidence using laboratory testing data from the Children's Hospital of Colorado. At a threshold of 10 cases per week, ALERT-selected intervention periods performed better than the observed hospital site periods (2004/2005-2012/2013) and a CUSUM method. Additional simulation studies show how data properties may effect ALERT performance on novel data. We found that the conditions under which ALERT showed ideal performance generally included high seasonality and low off-season incidence.",

One component of infectious disease control is early detection, which is a goal of infectious disease surveillance systems at the local, state, and national levels. 2 This transition from endemic to epidemic activity is critical, as it corresponds to an increase in demand for healthcare and necessitates the implementation of protective measures. During outbreak periods, the \"epidemic onset\" occurs when case counts rise above a predefined background level. 3 Upper respiratory illnesses, caused by influenza A, influenza B, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are common in temperate regions worldwide. Seasonal outbreaks of these viruses are one of the primary reasons that healthcare facilities implement periods of time where enhanced infection precautions are enforced. 1 In one study of the mortality associated with these infections, influenza A (H3N2) caused the highest number of deaths, followed by RSV, influenza B, and influenza A (H1N1) viruses. 4 The actual toll of these illnesses is difficult to calculate as upper respiratory viruses are often accompanied by circulatory or pneumonia complications, especially in the young and elderly. Estimates of average annual influenza-related deaths in the United States range from 10,682 to 28,169, while RSV-related average annual deaths have been estimated at 6211 to 17,199. 5 In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the influenza season as beginning in November and ending in April, with influenza activity seen as early as October and as late as May in some regions. The exact dates related to the onset of the influenza season vary at the state and local level.",

Selection of these triggers is often based on anecdotal observations based on historical incidence or monitoring of local or regional influenza activity. Practical challenges to implementing seasonal policies may provide motivation for healthcare sites to decrease the duration of these periods as soon as possible while still controlling infection spread. Increased personal protective equipment is expensive and often unpopular among healthcare workers, patients, and visitors, which can be found documented in the personal protective equipment compliance literature. 6 Efficient selection of the intervention periods would be financially savvy for hospitals and clinics while maximizing patient protection. Increased numbers of patients during respiratory season drive the need for hospitals to add additional staff (traveling nurses) to be able to provide safe care. Administration has the challenge of when to bring in temporary support and how long to retain them each year. Predicting the increase in seasonal respiratory illness season would enable them to limit the time for the contract and potentially decrease the expense.",

For the stochastic prediction of infectious disease spread between individuals, mechanistic models (such as agent-based 7 and compartmental susceptible-infectious-recovered, 8 among others) are well developed and have been implemented as stand-alone forecasting models. 9,10 Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models are well-known statistical approaches for modeling time-series, such as infectious disease case counts, that correlate with past observations. 11,12 Both statistical and mechanistic models have been used successfully in infectious disease forecasting. 13, 14 However, these methods on their own are not designed specifically to detect onset periods or guide real-world policy. Other research has used thresholds in order to characterize influenza incidence into low, moderate, and high categories using a \"Moving Epidemic Method\", which uses maximum accumulated rates percentage (MAP) based on incidence rates per 100 000 inhabitants, or consultations. 15, 16 This approach characterizes the intensity of influenza epidemics and can also trigger enhanced protective interventions, but is intended to be used on a larger scale than that available at even the largest hospital sites. The most common algorithms that are designed to trigger interventions during an outbreak are CUSUM-based methods and their variants, 17,18 the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA), 19, 20 and the space-time permutation scan statistic model. 21, 22 All of these methods involve detections of deviations from expected values, or threshold values, based on historical data.

Multiple peaks during a season are common in data of mixed upper respiratory disease incidences, or even for data containing multiple strains of the same disease, where peak timing can vary. The respective heights of the peaks do not affect which one triggers the ALERT period. If a season contains two or more separate peaks, the first peak will trigger the ALERT period if the peak incidence exceeds the threshold value. If the threshold selected by the user is too high, the second peak may be missed if the nadir incidence drops below the trigger before the onset of the second peak. As ALERT was intended to apply to seasonal infectious diseases, users should proceed with caution if their data contains regular patterns of multiple peaks that they wish to capture.

Furthermore, the approach taken by ALERT and outlined in this paper has the advantage of not requiring advanced statistical training or expensive equipment.

While many large healthcare facilities track incidences of lab-confirmed infectious diseases, smaller facilities may not currently have the capacity for multiyear incidence recordkeeping. While there is some evidence from performance on the influenza A, influenza B, and RSV combined dataset that ALERT may be used on symptom based rather than lab-confirmed illness, this has not been studied directly to date. If only a few years of historical data is available for a site, the reliability of ALERT's triggers may be in doubt and the threshold trigger should be recalibrated by repeated ALERT runs as additional data becomes available. Likewise, in real data, as opposed to simulated data, we should expect that seasonality parameters may vary over time. Some of the inter-season variability we observed may be due to temporal differences in these parameters. ALERT was intended for use with strongly seasonal datasets but can accommodate some variability in these parameters. Our observations in this paper show that inconsistency resulting in occasional multiple peaks may be problematic. Likewise, differences in simulation parameters between the training and testing seasons in the simulated data would likely result in reduced ALERT performance, which is why we recommend recalibrating the chosen threshold to new data when it becomes available. The duration of recorded historical data needed to derive useful trigger thresholds will likely vary based on seasonality and randomness characteristics of the historical data. ALERT relies on the assumption that past respiratory illness seasons will be similar to the future, which is why it performs well on seasonal data. We can observe in the more random and less seasonal simulations and in 2009 of the real data that violations of this assumption will impact ALERT's performance. ALERT will stop with an error message if the data is not a good fit for the program, either due to unclear peak patterns or increasing or decreasing baseline. Future studies should compare the performance of ALERT to the other threshold-based methodologies for outbreak detection.",

We chose the 2004/2005-2012/2013 subset of the full data (2002/2003-2012/2013) because data on the time periods of increased protection implemented at the hospital site are not available prior to the 2004 season. The dataset was divided into training seasons (2004/2005-2007/2008) and testing seasons (2008/2009-2011/2012). We applied the ALERT algorithm to the training set to choose a set of threshold values and compared those to hospital-derived PPE periods, results of which are shown in Table 1. The CUSUM approach was calibrated to give a median (D s ) of 19.0 weeks, to match the observed intervention periods. In the training portion of the dataset, the hospital-derived increased PPE periods lasted a median (D s ) of 19.0 weeks, ranging from 20.0 weeks in the 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 seasons to 18.0 weeks in 2007/2008 and 2008/2009. We chose trigger thresholds of 6, 10, and 21 cases as illustrative examples, as shown inTable 1andFigure 2. Notably, p = 10 results in a median D s that is equivalent to the median D s of the hospital-derived respiratory protection period.The testing portion of the dataset shows that CHCO would have benefited from implementing the ALERT algorithm in their hospital from 2009 to 2012 at s = 10. Across all years, the sum of all ALERT periods was 145 weeks long, while the as-implemented intervention time totaled 155.4 weeks long. The ALERT period would have covered 5.7% more patients over an equivalent median D s , and saved the hospital a total of 10.4 weeks of intervention time. Furthermore, ALERT",
