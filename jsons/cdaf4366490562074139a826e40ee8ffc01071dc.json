This article describes a novel strategy to develop short-and longterm protective immunity against chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, using a relevant emerging infectious disease model. CHIKV is a mosquito-borne RNA pathogen that has infected millions [1, 2] . A precipitous increase in cases of CHIKV infection and disease has been recently reported [3, 4] , along with an increase in morbidity and mortality, suggesting increased virulence [5, 6] . These findings underscore the importance for developing anti-CHIKV prophylaxis and therapies [1, 7] . To date, however, no CHIKV vaccine has been licensed, although a variety of strategies are being evaluated [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Importantly, anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers may be a protective immune correlate [14] [15] [16] . Passive immunotherapy has been an important short-term intervention against several infectious diseases, including monoclonal antibody (mAb) prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus [17] . However, passive antibody delivery has limitations because of the short half-life of immunoglobulins [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

            "text": "Conventional vaccines typically require a lag phase before antibody generation, in addition to multiple immunizations, to be effective [18, 22] . Furthermore, vaccination-induced protection can be problematic in some populations (ie, immunocompromised individuals), limiting immune control of infection outbreaks in these groups. The rapid local spread of CHIKV underscores the importance of conferring effective and timely immune protection [7, 23] . While a passive antibody therapy strategy is an attractive method for a short-term intervention against viruses such as CHIKV [2, 14, 24] , the cost, production complexity, and cold chain requirements limit this approach. Therefore, the development of novel immunotherapeutic/prophylactic modalities that overcome these limitations is warranted. One such strategy is the in vivo delivery of expression plasmids encoding genes for the immunoglobulin chains of established functional mAbs. This approach bypasses conventional antibody production and may present unique opportunities for therapy, including combination with vaccines. Our group has recently described an in vivo-delivery method that involves electroporation of DNA plasmids encoding mAb (designated dMAb), rather than viral vectors [25] . Compared with viral vector-mediated platforms (ie, adeno-associated viral vectors) for mAb delivery [26, 27] , naked DNA plasmids represent a nonlive, nonintegrating, and noninfectious platform that does not generate antivector immunity [28] [29] [30] . Accordingly, it may have advantages for rapid antibody production and readministration because of the lack of serological interference often encountered with conventional immune-based strategies.",

For cloning of CVM1-IgG, a single open reading frame was assembled containing the heavy and light chain genes, separated by a furin cleavage site coupled with a P2A self-processing peptide sequence. This transgene was cloned into the pVax1 expression vector [31] . The CVM1-Fab VH and VL chains were cloned into separate pVax1 vectors. For tissue culture transfection, 100 \u03bcg of pVax1 DNA, CVM1-IgG, or CVM1-Fab (100 \u03bcg of each VH and VL construct) was used.

For the constructs expressing anti-CHIKV-Fab, the VH and VL genes were cloned separately. The optimized synthetic plasmids constructed from the anti-Env-specific CHIKV-neutralizing mAb were designated CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab, for the IgG and Fab antibodies, respectively.

A novel consensus-based DNA vaccine was developed by our laboratory and was capable of providing protection against CHIKV challenge in mice. The DNA vaccine also induced both measurable cellular immune responses, as well as potent neutralizing antibody responses in rhesus macaques [11, 12] . Groups of mice were administered a single injection of CVM1-IgG, CHIKV Env, or the pVax1, followed by viral challenge on 2 days after injection. Mice that received a single immunization of CHIKV Env or pVax1 died within 6 days of viral challenge, whereas a single immunization of CVM1-IgG provided 100% protection ( Figure 4A ). CVM1-IgG clearly conferred protective immunity more rapidly than the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine (P = .0026).",

The multibooster delivery of the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine conferred 100% protection ( Figure 4B ), while 80% survival was observed in mice administered CVM1-IgG (P = .0007). The kinetics of the induced antibody responses was measurable within 2 days of a single injection of CVM1-IgG, with peak levels by day 15 (approximately 1400 ng/mL) and detectable mAb levels maintained for at least 45 days after injection (Supplementary Figure 1A ). Although there is continued expression, these levels are decreased, compared with peak levels, supporting the partial protection noted in the experiment ( Figure 4B ). A, An immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that IgG generated from CVM1-IgG-administered mice was capable of binding to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope protein (Env). CHIKV-infected Vero cells were fixed 24 hours after infection and evaluated by an immunofluorescence assay to detect CHIKV Env antigen expression (green). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Sera from control mice injected with pVax1 were used as a negative control. B, The binding affinity of sera from CVM1-IgG-injected mice (day 15) to target proteins was tested by Western blot, using cell lysates from CHIKV-or mock-infected cells as described in \"Materials and Methods\" section. Protein transferred membranes were reprobed with antibody against \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. The image presented here was cropped from an original image and is representative of several gels. C, Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis of the binding of sera from plasmid-injected mice to CHIKV-infected cells. The x-axis indicates green fluorescent protein (GFP) staining, using the lentiviral GFP pseudovirus complemented with CHIKV Env. The y-axis demonstrates staining of infected cells by human IgG produced in mice 15 days after injection with CVM1-IgG. Staining with a control anti-CHIKV antibody (Env antibody) is also shown, as well as staining with no antibodies and pVax1. The presence and number of double-positive cells indicate presence and level of sera binding to the CHIKV-infected cells. D, Sera from mice injected with CVM1-IgG via electroporation possess neutralizing activity against multiple CHIKV strains (ie, Ross, LR2006-OPY1, IND-63-WB1, PC-08, DRDE-06, and SL-CH1). Neutralizing antibody titers are plotted, and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 values; parenthesis) were calculated with Prism GraphPad software. Similar results were observed in 2 independent experiments with at least 10 mice per group for each experiment.",

The effect of coadminstration of CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env on mouse survival in the context of CHIKV challenge was also evaluated. In this experiment, 20 mice were administered at day 0 a single dose of CVM1-IgG and 3 doses of CHIKV Env DNA as described above. Subsequently, half of the animals were challenged with CHIKV at day 2 and the other half at day 35. Survival in these groups was followed as a function of time. Not unexpectedly, both of the challenge groups had 100% long-term survival ( Figure 4C) . Specifically, results of the day 2 CHIKV challenge experiment indicated the utility of the CVM1-IgG reagent in mediating protection from infection, with the survival percentage decreasing to approximately 30% by 4 days after challenge in control ( pVax1) animals. Figure 4D indicates levels of anti-CHIKV IgG, by time, generated in mice that received CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env DNA vaccine; anti-CHIKV human IgG represents antibody produced by the CVM1-IgG plasmid and anti-CHIKV mouse IgG represents antibody induced by the CHIKV Env vaccine. Both human IgG and mouse IgG were detected and exhibited different expression kinetics. By 3 days after initial CHIKV Env DNA vaccination, mouse anti-Env antibody levels were essentially near 0 (mouse anti-CHIKV IgG). Conversely, 3 days after a single CVM1-IgG injection, human anti-Env antibody levels were significant (human anti-CHIKV IgG). These data underscore the importance of CVM1-IgG in mediating rapid protection from infection and death after CHIKV challenge.",

CHIKV Env elicited strong T-cell responses irrespective of codelivery with CVM1-IgG, showing the lack of interference of these approaches.

Thus, the ability of CVM1 IgG to suppress these disease-associated markers at early and late time points after viral challenge was assessed. Mice immunized with CVM1 IgG, CVM1 Fab, CHIKV Env, or CVM1 IgG plus CHIKV Env DNA vaccine generated mAb and significantly reduced viral loads ( Figure 5A ). In addition to viral load reduction, these mice did not exhibit footpad swelling, compared with control ( pVax1) immunized mice, and consistently gained body weight during the 20-day experimental period (Figure 5B and 5C). Also the CVM1-IgG-generated mAb and the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine exhibited significantly reduced levels of CHIKV-mediated proinflammatory cytokines (ie, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-\u03b2), compared with pVax1, 10 days after viral challenge (Supplementary Figure 2) . These findings suggest that a single injection with CVM1-IgG suppresses CHIKV-associated pathology to an extent comparable to that induced by protective vaccination [12] . Half of the mice were then challenged on day 2, and the remaining half were challenged on day 35 under the same conditions and with the same CHIKV isolate challenge described above.

Unlike viral vectors, DNA plasmids do not pose a risk of genome integration or generate antivector immunity, which allows for booster immunizations and co-vaccinations with multiple DNA plasmids Figure 5 . Characterization of pathologic footpad swelling and changes in weight in viral-challenged mice vaccinated with CVM1-immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope protein (Env) DNA. A, Viral titers 1 week after CHIKV challenge in mice that received CVM1-IgG, CHIKV-Env, CVM1-IgG plus CHIKV-Env, or pVax1 (control). Each data point represents the average viral titers from 10 mice. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. B, Mean daily weight gain (\u00b1standard deviation [SD]) after subcutaneous inoculation with the CHIKV isolate among mice that received CVM1-IgG, CHIKV-Env, CVM1-IgG plus CHIKV-Env, or pVax1. Mice were weighed on the specified days after inoculation. Results are presented as mean body weights (\u00b1SD). C, Swelling of the hind feet was quantified using calipers on the specified days among mice that received CVM1-IgG, CHIKV-Env, CVM1-IgG plus CHIKV-Env, or pVax1. Data are mean values (\u00b1SD). Abbreviation: PFU, plaque-forming units. [32, [46] [47] [48] . In addition, they are stable, which facilitates manufacturing and stockpiling and obviates the necessity for a refrigerated cold chain. The strategy could also be particularly useful to combat pathogens adept at escaping the immune response, since multiple plasmids encoding antibodies targeting different epitopes could be administered without serological interference [49] .",

            "text": "This study demonstrates that mice injected with a single dose of CVM1 IgG were fully protected from viral challenge 2 days after administration, whereas no mice survived infection following a single immunization with CHIKV Env DNA vaccine, owing presumably to an insufficient time to mount protective immunity. However, complete protection was observed with CHIKV Env after a immunization regimen followed by challenge at later time points. A similar level of protection occurred in mice administered a single dose of CVM1-IgG, although protection waned to 80% over time. Notably, the codelivery of CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env produced rapid and persistent humoral and cellular immunity, suggesting that a combination approach can have additive or synergistic effects. Importantly, codelivery of CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env were not antagonistic in terms of the development of short-or long-term protective immune responses, providing a new important approach that provides infection resistance against this relevant pathogen. These studies likely have importance for a variety of other infectious and noninfectious diseases.",

Mice were monitored daily, and survival rates were recorded for 20 days after viral challenge. C and D, Protection of mice from different routes of CHIKV challenge. Two groups of mice were injected with 100 \u03bcg of CVM1-IgG by the intramuscular route, followed by viral challenge on day 2 with either subcutaneous (C) or intranasal (D) inoculation. Mice were monitored daily, and survival rates were recorded for 20 days after the viral challenge. The black arrow indicates plasmid injections; the red arrow indicates the time of viral challenge. Each group consisted of 10 mice, and the results were representative of 2 independent experiments. P values for statistical comparisons between appropriate groups are indicated in panels A-D.",
