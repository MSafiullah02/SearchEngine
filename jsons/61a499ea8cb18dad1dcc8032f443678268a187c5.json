            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious 24 disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea that is characterized by severe hemorrhage and a 25 high fatality rate. Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this 26 disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-27 displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS 28 virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope 29 glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in 30 vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 31 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass 32 spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn 33 glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a 34 conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host 35 cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 36 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 37 247 of 272 reported SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that 38 Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more 39 than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates. 40 41 Author summary 42 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious 43 disease localized to China, Japan, and Korea. This tick-borne virus has infected more than 44 5,000 humans with a 6.4% to 20.9% fatality rate. Currently, there are no prophylactic or 45 therapeutic measures against this virus. Historically, antibodies from patients who recovered 3 46 from viral infection have been used to treat new patients. Until now, one recombinant 47 monoclonal antibody was approved for the prophylaxis of respiratory syntial virus infection. 48 We selected 10 antibodies from a patient who recovered from SFTS and found that one 49 antibody potently inhibited SFTS viral infection in both test tube and animal studies. We 50 determined the binding site of this antibody to SFTS virus, which allowed us to predict that 51 this antibody could bind 247 out of 272 SFTS virus isolates reported up to now. We 52 anticipate that this antibody could be developed into a therapeutic measure against SFTS. 53 54 Introduction 55 Since its isolation as a novel virus in 2011, cases of the acute infectious disease called 56 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS)[1] have risen rapidly in China, Japan, 57 and Korea, posing a risk to public health and increasing the fear of ticks that transmit the 58 deadly SFTS virus (SFTSV). From 2011 to 2016, this emerging tick-borne virus infected 59 5,360 people in China with an average case fatality rate of 6.40%[2]. After initial reports in 60 2013 of sporadic SFTS cases in South Korea[3] and Japan[4], South Korea reported 605 61 cases with an average case fatality of 20.9%[5] and Japan reported 310 cases with an average 62 fatality of 19.4%[6] from 2013 to 2017. 63 Ticks such as Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus are implicated as the 64 prominent vectors for transmitting SFTSV[7]. With regards to SFTSV hosts, various 65 vertebrate species are considered to have been infected, as evidenced by high SFTSV 66 seroprevalence in domestic animals in SFTS endemic regions[8,9]. Additionally, reported 67 cases of human-to-human transmission through contact with blood or body fluid, including 68 infections in healthcare workers from patients, pose a further threat to the public[10,11]. 69 Furthermore, the discovery of H. longicornis tick in the United States indicates the possibility 4 70 that SFTSV could spread to other continents, highlighting the need to prevent disease 71 transmission[12]. 72 SFTSV is a single-stranded negative-sense tripartite RNA virus that is classified as a member 73 of the Phlebovirus genus, Phenuiviridae family, and Bunyaviriales order. The genome of 74 SFTSV is comprised of L, M, and S segments, which encode RNA-dependent RNA 75 polymerase (L segment), envelope Gn glycoprotein (M segment), envelope Gc glycoprotein 76 (M segment) , nucleoprotein, (S gement) and nonstructural proteins (S segment) [13]. A 77 phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequences of SFTSV isolates found substantial 78 genetic diversity and accumulated mutations, suggesting that SFTSV has existed for decades 79 at minimum[14,15]. However, the difference in virulence between these SFTSV sub-lineages 80 has yet to be determined. 81 The major clinical features of SFTS include high fever, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, 82 vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and abdominal pain[16,17]. In severe 83 cases, SFTS can include central nervous system manifestations, hemorrhagic signs, and 84 multiple organ dysfunction, which can lead to death[18-21]. No vaccines or therapeutics 85 specific for SFTS have been approved for human use. Recently, a Phase 3 clinical trial of 86 favipiravir (Avigan \u00ae ), an drug approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in 87 Japan, was initiated to expand its indication to SFTS treatment[22]. Monoclonal antibodies or 88 convalescent sera from SFTS patients were tested to identify potential therapeutic 89 intervention targets, resulting in the identification of SFTSV glycoproteins as molecules 90 required for host cell entry[23,24] and also as critical targets for virus neutralization through 91 the development of humoral immunity. However, generating an antibody for these targets in 92 infected humans was found to be rare, due to the presence of immunodominant decoy 93 epitopes in the nucleoprotein[25], which is a common phenomenon in a pathogenic virus-94 infected host[26]. But in animal models, the protective effect of human convalescent sera was 5 95 shown, suggesting that antibody therapy is possible[27]. Thus far, MAb4-5 is the only human 96 neutralizing monoclonal antibody reported, and it was developed using a combinatorial 97 human antibody library from five patients[28]. MAb4-5 binds to domain III of SFTSV Gn 98 glycoprotein[29]. The neutralizing effect of MAb4-5 has been shown only in in vitro, and its 99 in vivo efficacy remains to be shown. 100 In this study, we constructed an antibody library from a patient who recovered from SFTS, 101 and selected antibodies against the Gn and Gc glycoproteins. Among these antibodies, Ab10 102 bound to Gn glycoprotein and showed a potent neutralizing effect both in vitro and in vivo. In 103 addition, we characterized the conformational epitope of Ab10 using crosslinking coupled 104 mass spectrometry and by testing its reactivity to alanine mutants, which allowed us to 105 estimate the strain coverage of Ab10. 106 107",

Total 340 RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (15596018, Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized 341 using a SuperScript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit with oligo dT priming (18080051,342 Invitrogen). From this cDNA, a phage-display library of human single-chain variable 343 fragments (scFv) was constructed, and four rounds of biopanning were performed to select 344 scFv antibody clones from the library, as previously described[61,62]. For each round of 345 biopanning, recombinant SFTSV Gn-Fc coated onto paramagnetic Dynabeads (14302D, 346 Invitrogen) were used. To select SFTSV glycoprotein binding clones, phage ELISA was 347 performed as previously described, using Gn or Gc glycoprotein -coated microtiter plates, 348 scFv displaying phages, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-M13 antibody 349 (11973-MM05, Sino Biological, Beijing, China)[62]. The nucleotide sequences of positive 350 scFv clones were determined by Sanger nucleotide sequencing (Cosmogenetech, South 351 Korea).

The expression 360 vectors were transfected into HEK 293F cells. The IgG 1 molecule was purified from the 361 culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using MabSelect\u2122 as described above. 362 Genes encoding the scFv-Fc fusion protein and the scFv-C\u03ba fusion protein were synthesized 363 and cloned into a pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). After transfection into HEK 293F cells, the 364 recombinant proteins were overexpressed and purified as described above. 365 366 SFTSV preparation and immunofluorescent imaging-based neutralization test 367 The SFTSV strain of Gangwon/Korea/2012[3] was propagated in Vero cells (10081, 368 Korean Cell Link Bank) with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium (LM 369 011-01, Welgene, Daegu, South Korea) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 370 serum (16000044, Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (10378016, Gibco). The fifty-percent 371 tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) values were titrated on Vero cells using the Reed-372 Muench method[65]. Ab10 or MAB4-5 scFv-Fc fusion protein was serially diluted in 10-fold 373 increments from a 50 \u03bcg/ml concentration, then mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID 50 374 SFTSV, and incubated at 37\u02daC for 1 h.

For the no infection control group, no virus was added to cells. In 377 contrast, for the infection control group, no antibody was incubated with virus. After 378 removing the virus-antibody mixture, cells were cultured for 2 days. For the IFA, cultured 379 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were 380 blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum381 albumin, followed by incubation with 5 \u03bcg/ml of anti-SFTSV Gn glycoprotein antibody[66] 382 at 4\u02daC overnight. After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:100 383 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Fc antibody (111-095-384 046, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). To stain the nucleus, 4'In vivo efficacy test 390 For animal experiments, the titer of SFTSV was measured by plaque forming 391 assay[67]. Either 2 or 20 plaque forming units (PFU) of Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain SFTSV 392 in 200 \u03bcl of PBS were inoculated in 8-to 10-week-old male or female A129 mice by a 393 subcutaneous (s.c.) injection route. After an hour of infection, mice were administered with 394 Ab10 IgG 1 antibody or a PBS vehicle control through an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection route, 395 at 30 mg/kg of body weight for every 24 h for a consecutive 4 days. Palivizumab 396 (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) or Mab4-5 IgG 1 was used as an isotype control or a 397 positive control antibody, respectively. In the delayed treatment model, the infected mice 398 were treated with antibodies at 1, 3, 4, or 5 days post infection (d.p.i.) for 4 days 399 consecutively. Body weight and survival of mice were monitored until 10 days post infection. 400 401 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 402 In order to measure the binding activities of the Ab10 and MAb4-5 IgG 1 antibodies, 403 96-well half-area microplates (3690, Corning, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with Gn-Fc 404 fusion protein and incubated at 4\u02daC overnight. Plates were blocked with 3% skim milk in 405 PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed with PBS and received 406 antibodies that were 10-fold serially diluted from 1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM in blocking buffer. The 407 plates were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with 0.05% 408 Tween20 in PBS solution. Then, 50 \u03bcl of HRP-conjugated anti-human Ig kappa light chain 409 antibody (AP502P, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) diluted in blocking buffer (1:5000) was 410 added into each well.

The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate 414 spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO, Thermo Scientific). 415 416 Surface plasmon resonance analysis of Ab10 417 The kinetics of Ab10 and Gn glycoprotein binding were measured by surface plasmon 418 resonance analysis, using a Biacore T200 instrument with sensor chip CM5, amine coupling 419 kit, and his capture kit (28975001, 29149603, BR100050, 28995056, GE Healthcare). We 420 followed the recommended manufacturer's protocol for the procedures and conditions of 421 reaction buffers, flow times, flow rates, and concentration of analytes. Briefly, anti-histidine 422 antibody was immobilized on an activated CM5 chip, followed by a deactivation step. Then, 423 histidine tagged Gn-C\u03ba was injected over the flow cells prior to antibody injection. For the 424 association step, all of the Ab10 IgG 1 antibody in PBS at concentrations of two-fold 425 increments ranging from 1.25 nM to 80 nM was injected for 3 min. For the dissociation step, 426 PBS containing 0.005% of Tween20 was injected for 5 min. After each dissociation step, 427 chip regeneration was performed. 428 429 Conformational epitope mapping by crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry 430 The epitope of Ab10 antibody was first determined by analyzing the complex of Ab10 431 antibody and SFTSV Gn-C\u03ba antigen linked with deuterated cross-linkers, as previously 432 described[30]. Briefly, antibody, antigen, and antibody/antigen complex were characterized 433 by the high mass matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry 459 HA antibody)} / {(Abs of wildtype captured by Ab10) / (Abs of wildtype captured by HA 460 antibody)}].",

Additionally, several groups, 267 including ours, have elucidated unconventional virus neutralizing mechanisms that affect the 268 infection steps that occur after membrane fusion[56,57].269In our crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry and alanine mutant studies, the Ab10270 epitope was confined to domain II and the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein. Although the 271 crystal structure of the phlebovirus Gn glycoprotein stem region has not yet been solved, a 272 recent report showed a cryo-electron microscopy map of RVFV, and depicted the crystal 273 structure of the RVFV Gn glycoprotein head region without a stem region[58]. The report 274 also describes the membrane fusion mechanism of RVFV that is mediated by a low pH 275 induced exposure of the hydrophobic Gc fusion loop. At a neutral pH, the Gn domain II (\u03b2-276 ribbon domain) shields the Gc fusion loop in the pre-fusion state and prevents premature 277 fusion. Based on this report, we hypothesize that Ab10 simultaneously binds to domain II and 278 the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein and prevents un-shielding of the Gc fusion loop. 279 In conclusion, Ab10 is a monoclonal antibody that has shown therapeutic efficacy in a 280 mouse SFTSV infection model. Although the neutralization efficacy of Ab10 was only tested 281 in the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain that was cultured in Vero cells, we confirmed its binding 282 capability to recombinant SFTSV Gn in the HB29 and SD4 strains, which are both from 283China. According to the epitope revealed in this study, Ab10 is estimated to interact with the 284 majority of SFTSV isolates currently reported. Based on these results, we believe that Ab10 285 has sufficient potential to be developed as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for a broad 286 variety of SFTS isolates.",
