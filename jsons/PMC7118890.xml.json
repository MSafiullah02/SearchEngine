Coronaviruses typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract, but already in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) with a mortality rate of about 10% among infected patients was introduced in the human population. SARS-CoV spread world-wide and caused more than 8000 diagnosed infections, but was contained within a year after its emergence (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/).",

This apparent case-fatality rate of 35% is of grave concern, because epidemic spread as has been observed for SARS-CoV could result in a disastrous death toll. MERS-CoV has been introduced zoonotically by transmission from dromedary camels to human patients (Alagaili et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2014, Reusken et al., 2013a) and serological studies indicate wide-spread and early distribution among this animal host (Alagaili et al., 2014, Reusken et al., 2013b). Therefore, a continuous risk of transmission especially to persons in close contact to camels is evident. Fortunately, the human to human transmission rate has remained low. Aside of individuals with regular contact to camels, only health care workers or relatives of MERS-CoV patients have a considerable risk of infection (Alraddadi et al., 2016, Drosten et al., 2014), but still at a modest level. Nonetheless, the high case fatality rate, the recurrent outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections, and especially the risk of virus adaptation potentially resulting in epidemic or even pandemic spread make the development of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV an international priority.",

This candidate induces both robust humoral and functional cellular immune-responses against MERS-CoV. Moreover, MERS-CoV viral load and inflammation of the lung were significantly reduced in challenged mice that had been vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H), before (Malczyk et al., 2015).",

These are of special interest, since it has been shown that T cells are essential for clearance of the infection (Coleman et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2014): Depletion of CD8+ T cells increased overall inflammation, bronchiolar inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration, and pleuritis at day 7 post-infection in mice (Coleman et al., 2017), while MERS CoV-susceptible mice depleted of all T cells were unable to clear the virus (Zhao et al., 2014). As an alternative to the spike glycoprotein, conserved (internal) structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid protein N are of special interest as putative target of anti-viral T cell responses to be triggered by future MERS vaccines (Agnihothram et al., 2014).",

Single cell clones were derived by flow cytometric sorting of single GFP-positive cells. Antigen expression by transduced DCs was verified by Western Blot analysis (data not shown). ELISpot assays using splenocytes of vaccinated animals in co-culture with JAWSII-MERS-N or DC2.4-MERS-N revealed about 200 IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells per 1 \u00d7 106 splenocytes after immunization with MVvac2-MERS-N(H) (Fig. 1G), which was significant over controls. Additionally, cellular immune responses targeting MV antigens were detected upon stimulation with MV bulk antigens in vaccinated mice that had received any recombinant virus, as expected. However, MV bulk antigens stimulated about 930\u20131500 IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells per 1 \u00d7 106 splenocytes of MV vaccinated animals, as described, before (Malczyk et al., 2015). Finally, splenocytes of all mice revealed a similar basic reactivity to unspecific T cell stimulation, as confirmed by similar numbers of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells upon ConA treatment (Fig. 1G). Thus, the generated MV-based vaccine platform expressing MERS-N induces significant MERS N-specific cellular immune responses, as desired. In any case, humoral and cellular responses induced by vaccine candidate MVvac2-MERS-S had been considerably higher in previous analyses under similar conditions (Malczyk et al., 2015). Therefore, further characterization of anti-MERS-CoV immunity induced by MVvac2-derived vaccines proceeded with this MERS-S encoding vaccine candidate, which yielded approximately 5-fold higher numbers of reactive T cells after vaccination.",

The isolated splenocytes were re-stimulated with MERS-S immunodominant peptide S1165 (Channappanavar et al., 2014) or MV bulk antigen (MV bulk) to analyze MV-specific cellular immune responses. Ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL-peptide (SIN) served as peptide negative control, or cells were left untreated (mock). Stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) was used to confirm general T cell reactivity in splenocyte preparations (Fig. 2H). While splenocytes of all mice responded to ConA with 1000 to 1500 spots per 1 \u00d7 106 splenocytes, only those from animals vaccinated with live MVvac2-MERS-S(H) could be stimulated with MERS S-specific peptide S1165 reaching mean values of 1040 spots per 1 \u00d7 106 splenocytes. In contrast, splenocytes of the UV-inactivated group or control virus MVvac2-ATU(P) could not be re-stimulated to secrete IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, only replication-competent vaccine viruses induced MV-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice.

MVvac2-MERS-N vaccine candidates indeed induced significant antigen-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated transgenic mice, revealing that also MERS N-expression by recombinant MV may have a useful role to combat MERS-CoV.

This induction of multifunctional T cells is quite in accordance with previous studies, since the potential of MV during natural infection or the recombinant MV to induce multifunctional, antigen-specific T cells has already been demonstrated. Infection of macaques with wild-type MV induces polyfunctional T cells specific for MV proteins with increasing numbers of cells secreting IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, as well as IFN-\u03b3 over time (Nelson et al., 2017), and polyfunctional T cells directed against MV-H can be expanded from PBMC of human donors (Ndhlovu et al., 2010). Likewise, HIV-vaccine candidates MV1-F4, which encode Gag, RT, and Nef of an HIV-1 clade B or a clade C strain as foreign antigen, induce antigen-specific multifunctional T cells simultaneously expressing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 in mice and also macaques (Stebbings et al., 2013, Stebbings et al., 2012). While the combination of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 indicates functional T cells with higher potency, in general, expression of IL-2 is a sign of the induction of CD8+ memory T cells (Williams et al., 2006). In our study, the strong correlation of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 expression thus indicates a high functionality of induced T cell responses. Extension of the antibody panel for IL-2 detection could yield further insight into the durability of these T cell responses induced by the MV vaccine platform in future studies.",

The mean VNT was somewhat lower than expected (Malczyk et al., 2015), but still quite high. An alternative vaccine candidate derived from modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA-MERS-S, revealed protection in dromedary camels, the natural host for MERS-CoV (Haagmans et al., 2016). Passive immunotherapy with dromedary immune sera significantly reduced MERS-CoV titers in lung tissue of challenged mice, starting with a VNT of 160 (Zhao et al., 2015). Neutralizing antibody titers in reconvalescent plasma of human patients diagnosed with MERS were determined by microneutralization tests in two previous studies, and were on average at 175 (Arabi et al., 2016) or 58.3 (Zhao et al., 2017). Furthermore, a PRNT50 titer of at least just 50 was required to lower virus titers by more than 0.5 log in mice challenged after transfer of human reconvalescent plasma (Zhao et al., 2017). These titers were exceeded in this study. In addition, MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induced higher anti-MERS-S titers in C57/BL6 mice than MVA-MERS-S in Balb/c mice, when comparing studies that used similar virus titers for vaccination (Malczyk et al., 2015, Volz et al., 2015), thus indicating an at least comparable efficacy. Thus, also VNT determined here indicate efficacy and were anyway not statistically different from those published before for MVvac2-MERS-S(H) (Malczyk et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the exact correlates of protection for MERS-CoV remain to be determined in future studies, since it will be essential to evaluate the efficacy of the different vaccine candidates against this most important benchmark.",

While neutralizing antibodies can in principle also be induced by inactivated vaccines or proteins, e.g. full-length or truncated MERS-S protein in combination with adjuvant (Wang et al., 2015). Obviously, the amount of MERS-S antigen within the MVvac2-MERS-S(H) vaccine formulation or the adjuvant effect of the inactivate were not sufficient during application. Therefore, replication of the MV-derived MERS vaccine candidate is necessary for the induction of immune responses both against vector and antigen of interest in vaccinated animals. Indeed, the induction of cellular immunity is usually more efficient by de novo expression of antigen after immunization. Consequently, the application of a replication competent vaccine platform is justified here to robustly induce potent responses of both arms of the adaptive immune system.",

Remarkably, MV vaccine strain virus encoding Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) antigens was already tested in a phase I clinical trial in adult human vaccinees (18\u201345 years old) (Ramsauer et al., 2015).
