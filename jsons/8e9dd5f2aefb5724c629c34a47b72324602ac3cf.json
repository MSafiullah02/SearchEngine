Special examination rooms and passageways should be reserved for suspected patients. The signs should be clear and special nurses can accompany the patients to avoid contact with other patients. Operators should make standard protection and try not to contact the patients directly. They can instruct the patients to pose themselves through the protective glass. After that, patients should leave quickly to shorten their stay in the radiology department. Then the examination room should be sterilized and the next patient should be checked at intervals of more than half an hour. If there is no special examination room for suspected patients, try to divide the time period for the ordinary patients and suspected patients. Suspected patients were concentrated in a certain period of time for examination, and the examination room should be thoroughly disinfected after completion. In addition, ordinary patients should be limited to reduce the chance of cross-infection. The use of mobile X-ray machines is also a good option in emergency departments, intensive care units, and isolation rooms.",
