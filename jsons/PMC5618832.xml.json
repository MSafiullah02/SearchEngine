It was proposed that the list will be reviewed annually or when new diseases emerge. This priority list forms the backbone of the new WHO Blueprint for R&D preparedness by focusing accelerated R&D on dangerous pathogens which are the most prone to cause epidemics. A further three diseases were also listed as serious, necessitating further action as soon as possible: chikungunya, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and Zika.[9]",

From the 1960s to 1980s, human infections were found across Africa and Asia, typically accompanied by mild illness. The first large outbreak of disease caused by Zika infection was reported from the Island of Yap (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007. In July 2015, Brazil reported an association between Zika virus infection and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In October 2015, Brazil also reported an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly.[25]",

Since its re-emergence in 2003, outbreaks of AI have been reported from poultry in Asia to Europe and Africa. According to the WHO, 16 countries have reported 846 laboratory confirmed human cases of AI including 449 deaths since 2003 through January 2016. Of these 16 countries, 4 were in the South-East Asia Region, namely, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Thailand. In India, the first outbreak of AI occurred in Maharashtra and Gujarat in February 2006. Since then, 25 episodes of AI A (H5N1) were reported from 15 states and union territories till January 2015. Fortunately, no human case of AI A is detected in India so far. However, it is kept under rigorous surveillance under Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP).[53]",

Under IDSP, surveillance units have been established in all states/districts and central surveillance unit is established and integrated into the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi. Training of state/district surveillance teams and rapid response teams has been completed for all 35 states/UTs. Information technology network connecting 776 sites in states/district headquarters and premier institutes has been established with the help of National Informatics Centre and Indian Space Research Organization for data entry, training, video conferencing, and outbreak discussion. Weekly disease surveillance data on epidemic-prone disease are being collected from reporting units such as subcenters, primary health centers, community health centers, and hospitals including government and private sector hospitals and medical colleges. Media scanning and verification cell established under IDSP in July 2008 detects and shares media alerts with the concerned states/districts for verification and response. District laboratories are being strengthened for diagnosis of epidemic-prone diseases. These laboratories are also being supported by a contractual microbiologist to manage the laboratories. In 9 States, a referral lab network has been established by utilizing the existing 65 functional laboratories in the medical colleges and various other major centers in the states and linking them with adjoining districts for providing diagnostic services for epidemic-prone diseases during outbreaks. Based on the experience gained, the plan will be implemented in the remaining 26 states/UTs. Considering the nonavailability of health professionals in the field of epidemiology, microbiology, and entomology at district and state levels, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) approved the recruitment of trained professionals under NHM in order to strengthen the disease surveillance and response system by placing one epidemiologist each at state/district headquarters, one microbiologist and entomologist each at the state headquarters. The post of a Veterinary Consultant at State Surveillance Unit has been approved by the MOHFW recognizing the Mission Statement of One Health Initiative (multidisciplinary collaborative approach to solving global and environmental health challenges).[67]",

GOARN is basically a multidisciplinary technical collaboration of over 200 technical institutions and networks that works with over 600 partners worldwide, including national public health institutions and hospitals, ministries of health, academic, research and technical institutions, networks, such as laboratories, surveillance initiatives and research agencies, United Nations, and international and nongovernmental organizations.[70]",

From 2009 to 2015, the GDD center in India supported effective response to 74 outbreaks, including hepatitis A, dengue, measles, avian flu, anthrax, cholera, and malaria, training of over 2000 public health officials in short-term public health exercises, including epidemiology and laboratory, rapid response, and risk communication and graduation of 13 future global health leaders as part of the 2-year Field Epidemiology Training Program.[71]",
