To address this gap, innovative surveillance methods have been developed over the last several years to leverage the increasing availability of digital data related to outbreaks. To date, many studies have retrospectively examined nontraditional digital data sources and have demonstrated their utility in estimating epidemic curves or changes in important epidemiologic parameters over time [1-3]. Such studies have provided a foundation for building near real-time prospective analytic techniques that can assess transmission dynamics in the absence of traditional data. These methodological developments fill a knowledge vacuum that may prove useful for public health decision making in the early stages of an outbreak.",

Although Zika virus is primarily transmitted via Aedes mosquitoes, evidence of vertical and sexual transmission exists [6-8]. Likely introduced to the Americas in mid- to late 2013, the virus has since been propagated by the density of competent vectors throughout the region [8]. At present, approximately 40 countries in Central and South America have experienced local vector-borne transmission, resulting in nearly 300,000 total reported cases to date [9]. Of the cases that have sought care thus far in the region, about 70,000 have been reported out of Colombia, of which 17% were pregnant at time of clinical or laboratory diagnosis [9,10]. However, given the generally mild nature of Zika virus disease and subsequent lack of care seeking, reported cases undoubtedly comprise a small fraction of total cases [11,12].",

Both R0 and d were solved for using nonlinear optimization to minimize the sum of squared differences (SSD) between reported (user-inputted) and modeled cumulative incidence (I) curves across multiple serial intervals (ie, outbreak generations). Figure 2 presents a formulation for I expressed in terms of R0 and d, where t is the number of outbreak generations (ie, serial intervals) that have passed thus far and is inversely proportional to the serial interval length (ie, number of days per serial interval [SI]).

As geographic granularity of digital surveillance data improves, similar analyses should be conducted at smaller scales. Nevertheless, given that projection models are designed to serve as decision-support tools, estimating the number of cases that will report to hospitals and clinics over the next several months\u2014even at the country level\u2014is still valuable for the purposes of resource allocation. This may be especially pertinent with respect to diagnostic support for pregnant women presenting with clinical symptoms for Zika virus disease.
