Diagnostic definitions were as follows: URTI was defined as ARI with no abnormalities on chest X-ray; bronchiolitis was characterized by cough, tachypnea, retraction and expiratory wheezes, often accompanied by rales; bronchitis was used to define a lesser disease with rhonchi and cough, sometimes with wheezing; pneumonia required rales on auscultation or the demonstration of an infiltrate by chest X-ray [18, 19].
