Primary viral pneumonia (PVP) is a rare complication of seasonal influenza [2]. Severe influenza is more common in the course of pandemic than seasonal influenza. Yet, most individuals infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) IAV experienced an uncomplicated flu and up to 75% of infections were even estimated to be subclinical [3\u20135]. However, in a small subset of patients, H1N1pdm infection rapidly progressed to PVP with respiratory failure. A minority of patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in most cases [1, 3, 5]. The case-fatality rate for symptomatic H1N1pdm illness was estimated to be, depending on the age groups, between 0.002 and 0.308% in Western countries [3, 6].",

However, the molecular nature of such human factors has remained largely elusive. It was recently shown that single-gene inborn errors of immunity may underlie severe influenza. Indeed, IRF7 deficiency was associated with severe influenza in one child, and two adult patients with GATA2 deficiency died from severe H1N1 IAV infection [10\u201312]. It is interesting and intriguing that severe B- and T-cell deficiencies do not underlie severe influenza [9].",

At the age of 16 years, he was hospitalized for one episode of pneumonia. At the age of 31, he was admitted to the hospital due to flu-like symptoms lasting for 3 days. He presented with acute respiratory insufficiency. An X-ray showed an infiltrate in the left lower lobe. The patient was treated with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone. In a few hours, his condition evolved to severe respiratory failure with progressive pulmonary infiltrates. Empirical treatment with oseltamivir was started, and pharyngeal swabs were later positive for H1N1pdm IAV. Three days later, he was admitted to the ICU because of ARDS. Oseltamivir was withdrawn, and intravenous zanamivir was instituted.

Routine immunological analysis showed neutropenia, monocytopenia, and a nearly complete absence of peripheral NK and CD20+ B-cells. No immunological analysis had been performed on P2 during the flu episode. Historical immunological analysis from P1, P2, and P3 at the ages of 43, 21, and 13 years, respectively, showed severely reduced numbers of B-cells and monocytes; P3 also had severely reduced numbers of NK cells (Table 1). On the basis of these data, familial GATA2 deficiency was suspected. By the Sanger method, we found a novel missense heterozygous R396L mutation in GATA2 in the three patients. The mutation was not observed in their healthy relatives (Fig. 1a, b). We did not find the R396L mutation in public database (dbSNP, 1000 genomes), in 55 healthy Caucasian individuals and in 1022 individuals from 52 ethnic groups from the HGDP-CEPH panel. Residue 396 is highly conserved across species (Fig. 1c). In silico analyses performed by means of PolyPhen-2 and PROVEAN/SIFT showed that the damaging effect of the R396L mutation is highly probable. Mutations in the zinc finger-2 domain, particularly R398W (one of the most frequent mutations causing GATA2 deficiency), R398Q, R396W, and R396Q have been reported in several independent studies [12, 13, 16, 17, 19], underscoring the key role of these residues on GATA2 function. The novel R396L mutation suggests that the residue R396 at GATA2 may be a mutational hotspot.",

We observed a nonsignificant decrease in GATA2-mediated relative luciferase activity with increasing levels of the GATA2-R396L, GATA2-R398W, and GATA2-R396Q mutants. Similar results were obtained with constant amounts of the GATA2-WT vector and different amounts of GATA2 R396L, R396Q, and R398W mutants (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, GATA2-mediated relative luciferase activity was observed to decrease at higher concentrations of the R396L vector, which could suggest promoter competition. However, when statistical analysis was performed, the difference of GATA2-mediated relative luciferase activity between this point and the activity of the WT alone was not found to be significant, indicating that the observed decrease in relative luciferase activity does not fall into the loss of function category, which could be expected in a dominant-negative model. These results suggest that haplo-insufficiency could be the mechanism of GATA2 deficiency caused by the R396L, R398W, and R396Q mutations.",

Analysis of IFN-\u03b3- and IL-17A-producing T-cells in response to polyclonal activation, performed during the flu episode, showed that P1 had a strongly increased expansion of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (Fig. 5a). PBMC from P1 also showed a strong IFN-\u03b3 production after polyclonal activation (Fig. 5b). These results contrast with those from Bigley et al.

Accumulating evidence suggests that hypercytokinemia, particularly of IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL9, and/or CXCL10 (an IFN-\u03b3-mediated signature), plays a direct role in ARDS development and in IAV-mediated lung pathology and mortality, and that this effect is independent of viral titers [1, 33\u201335]. No data about viremia or inflammatory response in the other GATA2-deficient patients with fatal influenza were reported [11, 12]. Plasma levels of Th1 cytokines were also found to be high in GATA2-deficient patients and severe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease with a marked EBV viremia [36]. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to an EBV-positive lymphoma [36] severe herpes simplex virus infection [37] and disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii infection (Rodr\u00edguez-Gallego et al. unpublished results) developed in GATA2-deficient patients. HLH is a deadly systemic hyperinflammatory condition described as a cytokine storm, particularly of Th1 cytokines [38]. Taken together, our and previous data suggest that, in spite of the profound defects in mononuclear cells, hyperinflammatory responses (particularly Th1-mediated) may develop in GATA2-deficient patients. Abundant tissue-resident macrophages in lung, BM, and healthy skin can be observed in GATA2-deficient patients lacking circulating monocytes [11, 17, 39]. In fact, abundant macrophages had been previously observed in BM biopsies (P1 and P3) and lung biopsies (P3) from our patients. Although alveolar macrophages were found to be, at least partially, dysfunctional, these cells might offer an alternative route of antigen presentation in the absence of DC [17, 39]. Treg deficiency could underlie the exuberant IFN-\u03b3-mediated inflammatory response and immunopathology in these patients [40, 41]. Alternatively, a role of genetic variants involved in pathogen sensing and/or inflammatory responses to infection cannot be ruled out [42]. However, in the absence of data about the patient\u2019s viremia, we cannot exclude that overwhelming IAV infection is due to the observed deficiencies in mononuclear cells and underlies such an inflammatory response and ARDS in our patients.",

            "text": "In spite that P1 lacked peripheral B-cells for at least 11 years, he was able to produce neutralizing antibodies against the novel H1N1pdm IAV strain and a previous annual H1N1 strain. Broadly neutralizing antibodies directed against conserved regions of the hemagglutinin stalk and receptor-binding domain were recently described [43\u201345]. Since this patient had not been vaccinated against H1N1pdm, our results suggest that one or a few clones of long-living memory B-cells against a previous IAV expanded in patient P1 and that these cells produced antibodies able to cross-react and to neutralize H1N1pdm. Specific Abs are recognized as the main factor to prevent IAV infection, whereas cell-mediated immunity is thought to be crucial for the control of an established infection [1, 31, 32, 46]. This is the rationale for influenza vaccination. However, patients lacking T- and/or B-cells are not prone to severe influenza, although vaccination is considered not to be effective [9]. In any event, Abs able to neutralize H1N1pdm were unable to fight the ongoing infection in P1. In contrast to B-cells, NK cells, DCs, and monocytes, T-cells are thought to be relatively well-preserved in patients with GATA2 deficiency [27, 30, 39]. Our results suggest that T-cells are more affected in GATA2-deficient patients than previously suspected and, like in other leukocyte subsets, the effect of GATA2 deficiency on T-cells is progressive. P1 did not suffer from severe viral, mycobacterial, or fungal infections despite complete B-cell deficiency for at least 11 years and the absence of thymic output of T-cells for at least 19 years. Overall, our data emphasize that GATA2-deficient patients may live for a long time off one\u2019s immunological memories. Our data underscores the role that long-living memory T- and B-cells can play in the resistance to infection in adulthood, particularly in patients with late-onset primary or acquired immunodeficiencies.",

            "text": "Several primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) predisposing to viral infections were previously reported [47\u201349]. However, severe PID affecting T- and B-cells, such as severe combined immunodeficiency or agammaglobulinemia, do not predispose to severe influenza [9]. This contrasts with parainfluenza and other viruses, which often kill children with inborn errors of T-cells [9]. No predisposition to severe influenza was reported in patients with either isolated NK cell deficiencies or DC deficiency [9, 47\u201350]. PIDs affecting IFN type I and II have not been reported to have severe influenza [9]. To our best knowledge, IRF7 deficiency and GATA2 deficiency are the only described single-gene inborn errors of immunity associated with lethal IAV infection so far. The only known patient with complete IRF7 deficiency developed life-threatening influenza at the age of 2.5 years [10]. Her leukocytes, including pDCs, as well as fibroblasts and iPSC-derived pulmonary epithelial cells, produced diminished amounts of type I IFNs. The child is now 7 years old and well with annual vaccination against influenza as her sole prophylaxis, suggesting that IRF7 deficiency might not impair immunity against secondary IAV infection. IRF7 is ubiquitously expressed, and so susceptibility to severe influenza in IRF7 deficiency cannot be ascribed only to a hematopoietic impairment. Patients with AD GATA2 deficiency have a large clinical phenotype including viral infectious disease. Due to the profound impairment in so many leukocyte subpopulations, including loss or diminished pDCs and NK, it is difficult to propose the mechanism underlying susceptibility to severe influenza in GATA2-deficient patients. Besides its role in hematopoiesis, GATA2 is expressed in endothelium and lymphatic valves, and it is also involved in adipogenesis [17, 28, 39]. However, the clinical infectious phenotype of GATA2 deficiency is reversed by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [39], suggesting that hematopoietic anomalies are by themselves responsible for susceptibility to severe infection. Undoubtedly, the lack of pDCs and NK cells may contribute. However, unlike the IRF7-deficient patient, who survived life-threatening influenza in childhood, our and the two previously reported patients with GATA2 deficiency who died by IAV infection, with no hematologic malignancy at the moment of the IAV infection, died in adulthood [10\u201312]. Such deficiencies should be considered in selected patients with life-threatening flu, even in the absence of any personal or familial history. It is not known why some GATA2-deficient patients present with specific complications, particularly severe viral infections, while others (even family members with the same mutation) do not [17, 39]. A role of other genetic variants involved in innate immune responses cannot be ruled out. Our description of two adult relatives with AD GATA2 deficiency who died of flu, with no recent history of other severe infections, suggests that lethal flu may result from and actually reveal single-gene inborn errors of immunity, at least in some patients [51].",
