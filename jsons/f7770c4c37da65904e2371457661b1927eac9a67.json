Among available diagnostic tests, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is faster than culture and more sensitive than commercial antigen assays. Current neuraminidase inhibitors were approved on the basis of their efficacy in ambulatory patients, but seriously ill patients who receive these agents are less likely to die, even when treatment is initiated 148 h after symptom onset. For patients hospitalized with suspected influenza, it is unclear which circumstances warrant diagnostic testing and which warrant the use of empirical therapy. Rapid antigen assays may reduce the unnecessary use of other tests and medications but are relatively insensitive, thus eliminating many patients with influenza as candidates for treatment. Empirical antiviral therapy ensures that all patients receive treatment promptly, at a cost equivalent to that of diagnostic tests alone, but results in the receipt of treatment by many patients without influenza.

Of the 193 patients with influenza, 53 received treatment with amantadine or rimantadine, and 15 received treatment with NAIs. In-hospital mortality among these patients was 6%.

In North America, less severely ill patients would have been screened from this cohort and sent home, but, in Hong Kong, most patients with fever and respiratory and systemic symptoms were admitted to a hospital regardless of disease severity and were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses. Patients who had been symptomatic for \u04402 days received empirical therapy with oseltamivir; patients who had been symptomatic for \u04432 days received treatment at the discretion of their physician. In this study, a total of 356 patients were admitted to the hospital, and 257 received treatment with oseltamivir. Of those receiving treatment, 161 received treatment within 2 days of symptom onset. Patients who received treatment experienced a median reduction in their length of hospital stay of 2 days-an \u223c30% reduction-relative to that of patients who did not receive treatment or who received treatment 12 days after symptom onset ( ) [14] . P ! .0001 Further support for the use of specific antiviral therapy for hospitalized patients comes from data collected prospectively in a cohort study of patients in Toronto, which showed a surprisingly large reduction in mortality even when therapy was started 148 h after symptom onset [15] . This study correlated mortality with specific antiviral therapy over 2 influenza seasons (2004-2005 and 2005-2006) in Toronto. Of 327 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza who were admitted to a hospital, 106 patients (32%) received treatment with oseltamivir. Overall in-hospital mortality in this cohort was 10.7%. Although the observation of a treatment effect was not anticipated, owing to the small sample size, patients who received treatment with oseltamivir had a risk of death (OR) of 0.21 ( ), corresponding to a point estimate of a 79% reduc-P p .03 tion in mortality, compared with patients who did not receive treatment. Given the limitations of this study's methodology, it is not possible to state unequivocally that oseltamivir treatment reduces mortality among patients admitted to a hospital with influenza. On the other hand, because of the established treatment effect in healthy outpatients, the apparent magnitude of the treatment effect in compromised and seriously ill patients, and the established safety of oseltamivir, a placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe influenza may no longer be ethically justifiable.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1324, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1620, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1737, "text": "(2004-2005 and 2005-2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2136, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Of note, over the 3 seasons of surveillance in the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network (TIBDN) study, about onethird of patients were hospitalized within 48 h of symptom onset.

Both the fact that one-third of patients present early and the fact that treatment may be effective when initiated 148 h after symptom onset in hospitalized patients emphasize how important it is to improve our understanding of severe influenza illness. Another interesting finding from the TIBDN study is that, during the 2006-2007 influenza season, 2 of 21 patients admitted to an intensive care unit after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest tested positive for influenza [15] . This raises a concern that influenza may trigger ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death and supports the results of a number of cohort studies suggesting that influenza vaccination is protective against sudden death.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 365, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This accumulating evidence for a treatment effect suggests that it is prudent to establish a policy of antiviral treatment for patients who are seriously ill with influenza. Such a policy will have a low risk of adverse events and a low risk of increasing selective pressure for the development of resistant strains of influenza virus. Oseltamivir has no proven serious adverse effects [6, 7, 17] . The neurobehavioral adverse events reported primarily in Japanese adolescents may have been an effect of either influenza or treatment; only further study will resolve this question. Reassuringly, the rate of neurobehavioral adverse events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration by Japan is !1 case per 100,000 prescriptions [18] . For patients within the age range typically admitted to an intensive care unit, that rate is probably low enough to be of very limited clinical relevance. With regard to increasing selective pressure for the development of resistant virus strains, it is important to remember that NAIs are active against only influenza virus. If a patient treated with NAIs does not have influenza, no selective pressure is being applied, and antiviral resistance will not be increased in the patient population. This differs from the effect of empirical antibiotic therapy: every time an antibiotic is used, selective pressure is applied to the host's normal flora, whether or not the antibacterial is active against the pathogen being targeted. Past influenza-management guidelines have not offered much guidance regarding antiviral treatment for patients admitted to a hospital. Nonetheless, recent guidelines suggest that antiviral therapy should be offered to patients with severe illness and to those who are most likely to develop complications and/ or to die. For example, the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Canada/Canadian Pediatric Society recommends antiviral treatment for individuals with severe illness and for those most likely to develop complications from influenza or to die prematurely as a result [19] . The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends antiviral treatment for high-risk children and for other children with moderate to severe disease [20] . Italian guidelines recommend prioritizing therapy for patients at risk of complications, ensuring that patients take the drug as early as possible, and using antiviral therapy only at the seasonal peak of influenza prevalence [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 389, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 390, "end": 392, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2074, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2225, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2454, "end": 2458, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A decision to treat with antiviral therapy requires that physicians either rapidly make a reasonably definitive diagnosis of influenza or choose to treat empirically when the probability of influenza is above a certain threshold.

In Toronto, most hospital laboratories provide EIA testing. On average, EIA sensitivity is 50%-70%, compared with that for viral culture, and specificity is \u223c95%, depending on the laboratory and the test. However, the use of viral culture as the gold standard for sensitivity may be outdated. Table 2 compares the sensitivity of viral culture to that of RT-PCR [26] [27] [28] [29] . The proportion of virus detected by culture in the different studies ranges from 50% to 90%, or \u223c70% for purposes of estimation. Thus, actual rapid EIA sensitivity is not 60% but is closer to 60% of 70%, which is \u223c42%. Other rapid tests with sensitivities ranging from 24% to 90%, relative to that for viral culture, share the same limitation [24] .

However, empirical therapy has the disadvantage of resulting in many more patients receiving treatment than actually have influenza. The prevalence of influenza in some recent patient cohorts is shown in table 3 [11, 15, 28, 29] . These studies looked at data from different groups of patients, in different years and at different times of year. Seasonal and yearto-year variations in the underlying incidence of influenza explain much of the difference observed. Overall, these studies suggest that, during most influenza seasons, 10%-15% of adult patients with pneumonia and/or febrile respiratory illness are likely to have influenza virus infection [29] .
