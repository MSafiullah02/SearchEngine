The prevalence of physical multimorbidity was increased with older age (odds ratio 2\u00b793, 95% CI 2\u00b771-3\u00b715), among women (2\u00b770, 2\u00b704-3\u00b757), within a higher socioeconomic group (for quartile 4 [highest group] 1\u00b750, 1\u00b724-1\u00b782), and higher educational level (5\u00b717, 3\u00b702-8\u00b783); however, physical multimorbidity was more common in poorer regions than in the more affluent regions. An additional chronic non-communicable disease was associated with an increase in the number of outpatient visits (incidence rate ratio 1\u00b729, 95% CI 1\u00b727-1\u00b731), and number of days spent in hospital as an inpatient (1\u00b738, 1\u00b735-1\u00b741). We saw similar effects in health service use of an additional chronic non-communicable disease in different socioeconomic groups and among those covered by different social health insurance programmes. Overall, physical multimorbidity was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure (for the overall population: odds ratio 1\u00b729, 95% CI 1\u00b726-1\u00b732, adjusted for sociodemographic variables). The effect of physical multimorbidity on catastrophic health expenditures persisted even among the higher socioeconomic groups and across all health insurance programmes.",

This evidence suggests that multi morbidity imposes high economic costs on individuals and households. 12 Patients with multimorbidity incur substantial health expenditures due to their conditions, 13 and are more likely to be absent from work and less productive, with adverse economic conse quences. 12 However, the associ ations between multimorbidity, health service use, and levels of financial stress in different population groups have not been widely examined in lowincome and middle-income countries.",

However, we identified no national-level studies that used panel survey data in their analysis to examine the effect of multimorbidity on health service use and financial protection by socioeconomic group and populations covered by various social health insurance schemes in China. Research is urgently needed to generate evidence to inform health policy and health system responses to multimorbidity.",

Further studies examining the effect of multimorbidity due to other common chronic conditions (eg, Alzheimer's disease, depression, asthma) and infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis, AIDS, coronavirus disease 2019) are also warranted. The social patterning of multimorbidity in China requires further research that should include a wider range of morbidities, and more robust measures of both mental and physical conditions than has been recorded to date.",

We counted the number of non-communicable diseases for each participant to identify those who had physical multi morbidity. We did not include individuals with self-reported psychiatric and memoryrelated diseases due to potential recall bias. In CHARLS, each respondent's systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded three times by a trained nurse using a HEM-7112 electronic monitor (OMRON, Tokyo, Japan). Diagnosed hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, being on antihypertensive medication for increased blood pressure, or a combination of these factors. 19 In CHARLS, participants were asked about their use of outpatient and inpatient services via the following questions: \"How many times did you visit a general hospital, specialised hospital, clinic, or other medical facilities for outpatient care in the past month?\" and \"How many days did you stay in hospital over the past year?\" CHARLS collected self-reported information on how much respondents paid in total and how much they paid out of pocket (deducting the reimbursed expenses) for their outpatient visits during the past month and for inpatient visits during the past year. We multiplied the monthly spending by 12 to calculate the annual out-ofpocket spending for each participant for outpatient care. The same information was also collected for spouses of all participants. To calculate catastrophic health expenditures at the household level, we used the out-ofpocket spending data for spouses as well.",

All urban employees are required to join this scheme, which consists of a pooled fund for inpatient stays and individual medical savings accounts for outpatient visits. Approximately 283 million people were enrolled in UEBMI in 2014. 8 It is financed by payroll income from employees (2% of their salary) and employers (equivalent to 6% of employee's salary). 9 The per-capita fund of this scheme is US$424\u00b77. 10 The URBMI scheme aims to insure the rest of the urban population, including children, students, and other unemployed urban residents who are not covered by UEBMI. In 2014, 315 million people were covered by URBMI. The scheme is funded by a government subsidy (70%) and individual contributions (30%). 9 The per-capita fund of this scheme is $66\u00b72. 10 The NRCMS was launched in 2003 for the rural population, and expanded rapidly to cover about 802 million rural residents by 2013. 10 NRCMS funds are pooled at the county level. The NRCMS is financed by the premiums of those enrolled (approximately 20%) and generous subsidies from both central and local governments (approximately 80%). Annual government subsidies per enrolee increased from \u00a520 (US$2\u00b79) in 2003 to \u00a5380 ($55\u00b72) in 2015. The per-capita funding for NRCMS is $61\u00b72. 9 China has also established a medical assistance programme for subsistence allowance recipients, people in poverty, low-income household members, and critically-ill patients in poor families. This programme is jointly funded by the central and local governments. At the end of 2015, the Chinese Government announced the decision to integrate URBMI and NRCMS as the URRMI scheme, to achieve universal health coverage. 11 This integration has enabled a further extension of funding pools and narrowing of disparities in access to health-care services and medications, which existed between different insurance schemes. We used random-effects negative binomial regression models to investigate the association between the number of non-communicable diseases and the number of outpatient visits and inpatient hospital days. We adopted a negative binomial model instead of a Poisson regression model because the variances were greater than the means in outcome variables (appendix pp 4-5), suggesting that overdispersion was present in the outcome variables (likelihood ratio test of \u03b1=0, p<0\u00b7001). The negative binomial model allows for over dispersion by assuming that the individual error terms come from a particular probability distribution (the \u03b3 distribution). 22 We used a random-effects logistic regression model to estimate the association between the number of non-communicable diseases and the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure.",

The number of chronic non-communicable diseases was positively associated with increased use of both outpatient and inpatient care. This association appeared to be similar across socioeconomic groups and health insurance schemes. Physical multimorbidity was associated with increased likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure, with similar effect sizes between the highest and lowest income groups. Because greater absolute levels of expenditures are required to trigger the so-called catastrophic expenditure threshold for those in higher income brackets than those in lower brackets, these results suggest that people in higher socioeconomic groups might have more intensive health-care use or use more expensive health-care services than those in lower socioeconomic groups.",

We found no different effects of physical multimorbidity on health-care use between groups with different types of insurance. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of an increased number of chronic non-communicable conditions was associated with increased health expenditure. 16, 24 Although this association generally appeared to be similar across different socioeconomic groups in our study, our research also shows that the effect of multimorbidity on catastrophic health expenditure was increased for individuals at lower socioeconomic levels in the population covered by URBMI. A possible explanation for this observation is that less financial risk protection was available to people in the lowest income quartile who were enrolled in URBMI due to restricted benefits packages and a lack of coverage for some medications and inpatient services, which has probably led to a high incidence of catastrophic health expenditures. The cost of health care in urban health facilities is higher than that of rural health facilities. This difference could explain why lower socioeconomic groups covered by URBMI had a higher likelihood of catastrophic health expendit ures than those covered by UEBMI. A previous study has indicated that the percapita annual fund contribution for UEBMI was about six times higher than that for URBMI, suggesting that beneficiaries of UEBMI are likely to have smaller out-ofpocket spending than individuals enrolled in URBMI. 9 Our study had several limitations. First, the use of selfreported measures of chronic disease and health-care use might have underestimated their prevalence, particularly among older people and those from lower socioeconomic and educational backgrounds who might be more likely to under-report these factors. Second, the CHARLS questionnaire did not ask about all chronic diseases typically included in clinical database studies. Further studies examining the effect of multimorbidity due to other common chronic conditions (eg, Alzheimer's disease, depression, asthma) and infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis, AIDS, coronavirus disease 2019) are also warranted. The social patterning of multimorbidity in China requires further research that should include a wider range of morbidities, and more robust measures of both mental and physical conditions than has been recorded to date. Finally, this study only included people from China aged 50 years and older in 2015. The prevalence of multimorbidity and its effect among younger populations should be considered in future studies.",

Health systems need to shift from single-disease models to new methods of financing and service delivery to more effectively manage multimorbidity. 35 Strong primary health care, underpinned by multidisciplinary teams, is essential for cost-effective manage ment of multimorbidity. 4 In 2009, China began to rebuild its primary health care by developing community health centres, although progress has been mixed. 36 A trial in China that is testing the roll-out of the so-called people-centred integrated care programme, which incentivises primary health-care centres to manage patients with chronic diseases holistically, is an example of such a new approach. 37 Disease-specific guidelines are inadequate for the effective management of individuals with multimorbid conditions and new clinical guidelines for multimorbidity are needed. Countries such as the UK and Sri Lanka have developed clinical guidelines for multimorbidity that emphasise integration and patient-centred health-care services. 38 Our findings also provide new evidence on the growing financial burden of multimorbidity in China. Multimorbidity is costly to individuals and health systems. Outof-pocket spending on medi cines can severely compromise financial risk protection. 16, 39 A 2015 systematic review of studies on Chinese populations showed that as the number of chronic diseases increases from one to two, an individual's annual out-of-pocket health spending increased by an average of 5\u00b72 times, and as the number increased from two to three, their annual out-of-pocket health expenditures increased by an average of 10\u00b71 times. 10 Concerted efforts are needed in China and other low-income and middle-income countries with ageing populations to reduce inequalities due to multimorbidity, and its adverse effect on financial risk protection. China, which has the largest ageing population in the world, should develop targeted policies to ensure appropriate health services and financial risk protection for individuals with multimorbidity, particularly those in low socioeconomic groups who are at an increased risk of catastrophic health expenditures.",
