For the ACHD patient admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for either surgical or medical treatment, an assessment of the burden of multisystem disease, as well as an understanding of the underlying cardiovascular pathophysiology, is essential for optimal management of these complex patients. This chapter takes an organ-system-based approach to reviewing common comorbidities in the ACHD patient, focusing on conditions that are directly related to ACHD status and may significantly impact ICU care.",

Among 1200 ACHD patients followed over 7 years, 47% had abnormal lung function, including nearly 30% with moderately to severely reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) associated with a 1.6-fold increased mortality [1] . Similarly, among 2600 ACHD patients followed over 4 years, 18 .4% of those that died had lung disease versus 5% of those still living [2] . Patients with unrepaired lesions, cyanotic heart disease, single-ventricle palliation, and CHD repaired at on older age have a more significant burden of lung disease [1, 3] . Lung disease is an indication for hospital admission in 5-12% of ACHD patients and accounts for 12-14% of all postoperative readmissions [4, 5] . Furthermore, preoperative lung disease has been found to be a risk factor for longer ICU length of stay, adverse cardiovascular events, and in-hospital mortality [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Chest wall abnormalities due to scoliosis and prior thoracotomies also independently predict moderately to severely impaired lung function (odds ratio 3.2 and 1.9, respectively) [1] . The presence of scoliosis may result in reduced lung volumes on the side of the greater curvature, reduced number of alveoli and a proportional increase in \"remnant alveolar\" space closer to the spinal curvature, and abnormal development of the muscles of respiration [23, 24] . Therefore, the presence of scoliosis should factor into decisions regarding ventilation expectations and strategies to maintain adequate lung expansion.

Patients with Fontan circulation may develop progressive hypoxemia due to development of systemic to pulmonary venous collaterals related to elevated central venous pressures and venous stasis [13] and to arteriovenous malformations due to exclusion of putative hepatic factor. Chronic hypoxemia or structural pulmonary arterial disease in turn may promote development of aortopulmonary collateral vessels which may contribute to chronic pulmonary edema.

Pulmonary embolism, due to low-flow state, venous stasis in the Fontan baffle, and baseline prothrombotic state, is also common in the singleventricle patient population, with pulmonary embolism and chronic pulmonary embolic disease affecting 5-16% of patients [46] . Plastic bronchitis is a rare complication in the Fontan population characterized by acellular, noninflammatory casts that can result in obstructive pulmonary disease and worsening of baseline hypoxemia. It is at least in part due to elevated central venous pressures resulting in impaired lymphatic drainage and decompression into the pulmonary bed. In a study of nearly 1100 ACHD patients, 1.5% of patients were diagnosed with protein-losing enteropathy or plastic bronchitis [47] . Consultation with a pulmonologist should be considered to assist in management of casts, including aggressive pulmonary toilet in those patients who are breathing spontaneously. Treatment options in the cardiac ICU include aerosolized hypertonic saline or heparin or r-TPA nebulizer treatments to disrupt the casts and allow patients to more easily mobilize their secretions. Direct cast removal by bronchoscopy may be required in intubated patients.

In the presence of a Fontan fenestration or baffle leaks, higher mean airway pressure may result in worsening of baseline hypoxia due to right-to-left shunt. Without a fenestration or baffle leak, cardiac output may be impaired due to reduced preload to the systemic ventricle. The increase in Fontan pressures due to higher positive airway pressures can lead to ascites and pleural effusions, further impairing ventilation thus requiring even higher positive airway pressures. The effects are amplified when respiratory acidosis leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, thereby causing further increase in Fontan pressures. Cautious drainage of ascites and pleural effusions may be beneficial in this situation.",

Challenges to ventilation of single-ventricle patients, in particular those with Fontan circulation, have been covered in previous sections. Preoperative or routine outpatient pulmonary function testing and early consultation with a pulmonologist should be entertained in at-risk patients, particularly those with right ventricular disease, single-ventricle physiology, or cyanotic heart disease. Due to the myriad of possible pulmonary abnormalities in the ACHD population, all adult patients in the CICU should receive aggressive pulmonary toilet, ambulate early, and use incentive spirometry frequently.",

High central venous pressures may also contribute to development of ascites, causing abdominal compartment syndrome; high intra-abdominal pressures further increase CVP and therefore further reduce renal perfusion pressure. Ascites also limits downward movement of the diaphragm, necessitating higher-pressure ventilation, which further elevates right heart pressures and CVP.

Chronic systemic venous hypertension impairs lymphatic drainage into the venous circulation, resulting in dilatation of the lymphatic channels and collateral formation to allow drainage into lower resistance reservoirs, such as the intestine [67, 70, 71] . Although patients with PLE have the most profound abnormalities, patients without overt PLE may also have some degree of lymphopenia, presumably due to a chronic low level of protein wasting [67, 72] . These abnormalities are more pronounced later after Fontan operation, with a fourfold increase in the odds of significant lymphopenia in the second decade after Fontan [67] . Depressed immunoglobulin G levels are also found in patients with PLE with an associated impaired response to the pneumococcal, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccines. Despite this, PLE is not associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, nor is it a risk factor for hospitalization for infection [67, 72] . Although not a risk factor in isolation, in the ICU setting, it is important to recognize the potential for baseline immunodeficiency and increased risk of infection. A low level of suspicion for infection should be maintained in these patients.",

In a study of over 4000 ACHD patients, the incidence of IE was 3%, with the highest rates occurring in patients with unrepaired VSDs, repaired tetralogy of Fallot, and cyanotic heart disease [78] . The mortality rate of adult CHD patients with IE ranges from 4 to 8% [75] . In-hospital mortality is more likely to occur in those patients who have at least one prior cardiac surgery, patients with prosthetic material as part of their repair, patients with prior episodes of endocarditis or an intracardiac abscess, and patients of an older age [75, 76] . A specific cause of IE is identified in only 26-30% of ACHD patients [75, 79] , and only 70% of patients have an identifiable source of infection by cardiac imaging [76] , likely related to difficulty visualizing the intracardiac structures due to prosthetic materials and limited acoustic windows. ACHD patients may present with heart failure, embolic phenomena, or worsening valvar dysfunction as the heralding signs of IE [76] . The presence of any of these findings with associated fevers or elevated inflammatory markers, even in the absence of an identified vegetation by imaging or positive blood cultures, should raise suspicion for endocarditis. The most common organisms that cause IE in ACHD patients mirror those in the general population: streptococci and staphylococci [76] . Patients should therefore receive broad antibiotic coverage while awaiting blood culture results and speciation of organisms. Because of the potential limitations of echocardiography, PET/CTA is an emerging diagnostic modality in patients where the diagnostic suspicion is high or the identification of the site of infection may inform the decision between medical therapy and surgical intervention [76] .",
