One of\nits functions is to provide data with quality that serve to make decisions based on\nevidence.1\nUnfortunately, it is not easy to know the quality of data during public health\nemergencies of international concern such as the COVID-19 pandemic. During the influenza\nA(H1N1) pandemic, Benford\u2019s law was proposed as an objective and fast way to assess the\nperformance of surveillance systems during epidemics.2 Its usefulness was also evidenced in\nthe dengue epidemic in Paraguay (2009-2011)3 and the Zika epidemic in American\ncountries.4",
