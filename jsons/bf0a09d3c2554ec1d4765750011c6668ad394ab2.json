The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (\u0394C p ) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (\u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (\u0394C p = \u22125.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of \u0394C p from 0 to~\u22122.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of \u0394C p of~\u22123.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of~20\u00b0C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of \u0394C p greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below~20\u00b0C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from \u0394C p~0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts. Large negative values of \u0394C p as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37\u00b0C. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (\u0394S a_immob ) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. \u0394S a_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. \u0394S a_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative \u0394S a_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C in the case of dsDNA viruses. Compared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative \u0394S a_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment factors takes much of the entropy loss for \u0394S a_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37\u00b0C. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making \u0394S a_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37\u00b0C.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Abbreviations: AIV, Avian influenza virus; BBF, Brush border fragments from midgut; BTV, Bluetongue virus; Cp, Heat capacity at constant pressure; \u0394Cp, Change in heat capacity; Cr, Host cell receptor; CD4, Host cell receptor for HIV; Ctotal, Number of host cells which can bind virus in a given volume of host fluid (midgut or blood); C.V T , Number of host cells with bound virus at temperature t; DENV, Dengue virus; E A , Activation energy; EBOV, Zaire ebolavirus; EM, Electron microscopy; Env, HIV GP120 trimer envelope protein which binds to a single CD4 molecule; FCT, Fraction of arthropod midgut cells with bound virus at temperature T; \u0394GA_virus_T, Change in Gibbs free energy on association of virus and host cell at temperature t; GP, Viral (glyco)protein on virus surface that binds to Cr; HA, Haemagglutinin; \u0394HA_receptor_T, Change in enthalpy for binding of virus GP to host Cr receptor at a temperature t; HIV, Human immunodeficiency virus E-mail address: paul@galleryofbirds.com.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Microbial Risk Analysis xxx (xxxx) xxxx 2352-3522/", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Some viruses infect hosts over a range of temperatures depending on the host species. Most notable are the arboviruses which may infect the arthropod vector over a range of ambient temperatures from~15\u00b0C to >30\u00b0C (Mullens et al., 2004) , and then infect a vertebrate host at temperatures from 37\u00b0C up to 44\u00b0C in the case of West Nile virus (WNV) in infected American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) (Kinney et al., 2006) . Birds generally have higher body temperatures than mammals (Brault 2009) and the avian influenza virus (AIV) when jumping from birds to humans has to adapt to a temperature drop of 8\u00b0C since the temperature in the human upper respiratory tract is 33\u00b0C compared to~41\u00b0C in the avian intestinal tract which is the site of replication of avian viruses (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) . Bats have higher core body temperatures than primates (up to 42.1\u00b0C for Phyllostomus hastatus which is an omnivorous bat from South America) when flying (O'Shea et al., 2014) . The core body temperature during flight of the insectivorous free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) which may have been the origin of the 2013/15 severe Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa (Saez et al., 2015) is 40.5\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C (O'Shea et al., 2014) . Thus EBOV which infects a range of vertebrate species from bats to primates and deer may have to infect mammalian hosts over a range of temperatures. Similarly Nipah virus on jumping from fruit bats to pigs and humans (Daszak et al., 2013) may experience a small fall in temperature. Furthermore, cross-species transmission of viruses to bats (and other mammals) from invertebrates may occur with more regularity than has been appreciated (Bennett et al., 2018; Leendertz 2016) , and Bennett et al. (2018) have suggested that arthropods may host many \"bat-associated\" viruses that have defied detection in bats themselves (e.g. EBOV). Depending on the ambient temperature, viruses in arthropods would experience a 9\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C temperature increase on being ingested by a bat at 41\u00b0C (Gale 2017) and this could affect the binding affinity of the virus to its host cell depending on the thermodynamics of virus binding as is discussed here. In contrast other viruses only infect related host species, and in effect are maintained at similar temperatures. For example, simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infect 36 different nonhuman primate species in sub-Saharan Africa and SIVs from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have crossed species barriers on multiple occasions generating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 (Sharp et al., 2005) . Thus the main source of temperature variation experienced by SIV and HIV would be the effect of the circadian rhythm and the slight rise in temperature due to infection of the host which gives a range of 36\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C in the case of Rhesus monkeys (Huitron-Resendiz et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 235, "text": "(Mullens et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 397, "end": 418, "text": "(Kinney et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 480, "end": 493, "text": "(Brault 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 770, "end": 799, "text": "(De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 955, "end": 976, "text": "(O'Shea et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1194, "text": "(Saez et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1232, "text": "(O'Shea et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1474, "text": "(Daszak et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1696, "text": "(Bennett et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1712, "text": "Leendertz 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1740, "text": "Bennett et al.

Only virus binding is considered here. Thus according to the Van't Hoff Isochore, the binding affinity for a virus to its host cell at temperature T as represented by the association constant K a_virus_T would be greatly diminished for enthalpydriven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures compared to lower temperatures depending on the magnitude of \u0394H a_receptor_T (Gale 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 318, "text": "(Ngai et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 691, "end": 702, "text": "(Gale 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Indeed, assuming \u0394H a_receptor_T is constant over the temperature range, the more negative \u0394H a_receptor_T is in magnitude, the weaker the binding at higher temperatures.

The effect of this on K a_virus_T is considered in this work.

A recent analysis has shown that virion volume (and genome length) for dsDNA viruses decreases by about 55-fold as the temperature of occurrence (i.e. host) increases from 0 to 40\u00b0C (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) . The temperature of occurrence in these dsDNA viruses ranges from near zero for those inhabiting polar environments to over 40\u00b0C for those inhabiting endothermic vertebrates. Nifong and Gillooly (2016) suggest that this could reflect smaller viruses being able to replicate more quickly (due to more compact genomes) perhaps together with energetic constraints imposed by their hosts. However from the thermodynamic perspective, the decrease in volume and hence mass and radius of the virus will make \u0394S a_immob less negative for a smaller virus than for a larger virus. It is shown here how a less negative \u0394S a_immob increases binding of the virus at the relatively high mammalian body temperatures and it is proposed that thermodynamic binding constraints may give smaller viruses a selective advantage for infecting hosts at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds.

Initial attachment of the HIV virion to the host CD4 + T cell surface is relatively nonspecific (Wilen et al., 2012) with HIV Env interacting with negatively charged host cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans, or with pattern recognition receptors. According to Wilen et al. (2012) , non-specific HIV attachment to the host cell via any of these factors likely brings HIV Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and the CRR5 coreceptor, so increasing the efficiency of infection, although the physiologic role of non-specific attachment in vivo remains unclear. Here it is suggested that non-specific binding helps to overcome the thermodynamic entropy constraint of immobilisation of a large virus on binding at human body temperature by taking some of the entropy loss in \u0394S a_immob prior to specific HIV Env:CD4 binding.

In effect therefore the heat capacity of the \"bulk\" (i.e. non-GP/Cr) of the bound virus/host cell is the same as the sum of the heat capacities for the free virus and free host cell. This is acceptable because a change in heat capacity is related to a change in conformation of the molecular components (Myszka et al., 2000) and the conformation of the bulk of the host cell and the virus would be unaffected by attachment. Indeed, \u0394S a_immob is mainly related to changes in rotational and translational mobility of the virus particle as a whole (see below) and does not involve the conformational changes in GP and Cr which are accommodated in the \u0394S a_receptor_T term (Gale 2019) . Since the heat capacity of the \"bulk\" of the bound virus/ host cell is the same as the sum of the heat capacities for the free virus and free host cell, \u0394C p for the bulk equals zero, and according to Eq.

Therefore for the purpose of demonstrating the effect of \u0394C p on the temperature sensitivity of K a_virus_T , T 0 needs to be chosen to be well above or below the temperature range of interest. It should be noted that the choice of reference temperature is artificial and is only used here out of necessity to demonstrate the effect of different \u0394C p values while fixing the K a_virus_T intercept temperature.

Estimation of \u0394S a_immob for a virus There are currently no data available on the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob which was first defined through development of a thermodynamic model (Gale 2019). Xiong et al. (2013) reported a K d_virus of 10 \u221215 M for AIV where K d_virus is the dissociation constant for virus from the host cell and is the inverse of K a_virus_T . According to Yang et al. (2005) HIV virions bearing influenza A virus HA required 8 or 9 HA trimers for virus entry. This is equivalent to n = 24 to 27 HA monomers each of K d_receptor = 10 \u22123 M (Xiong et al., 2013) . It is not clear whether the 8 or 9 AIV HA trimers are required for cell binding or membrane fusion in Yang et al. (2005) . However, if n = 24 HA monomers are required for AIV binding to the host cell to give a K a_virus_T of 10 15 M \u22121 then \u0394S a_immob equals \u22121091 J/mol/K from Eq. (17) (derived in Gale 2019). This is in the same order of magnitude as assumed for \u0394S a_immob on the basis of virus molecular weight (Gale 2019) . It must be emphasized that the estimate of 8 or 9 HA trimers in Yang et al. (2005) is based on a number of assumptions that may not hold, for example whereas each infection of a cell is a quantal, all-or-nothing event, the infectivity of a virion could span a wide spectrum of propensities and each mathematical model could have different virological interpretations (see Klasse 2012) . However, in the absence of any data for \u0394S a_immob the value of n from Yang et al. (2005) at least provides a theoretical approach to estimate it from Eq.

Frey et al. (1995) attribute the increase at 25\u00b0C to the additional adhesion molecules which are brought into contact to increase the avidity of binding at higher temperatures. The thermodynamic model for HIV binding with \u0394S a_immob of \u2212206 J/mol/K reproduces the increase in predicted C.V T in Fig. 6a by increasing n from 1 to 3 over the temperature range 25\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C to reflect the effect of temperature facilitating multiple HIV adhesion/binding sites due to increased membrane fluidity (Frey et al., 1995; Harada et al., 2004) .

Thus it is proposed here that the value of \u0394S a_immob is not only important in explaining the observation that dsDNA viruses infecting warmer hosts are generally smaller in volume than those infecting colder hosts (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) but also may contribute to explaining the need for attachment factors to allow binding of a large virus such as HIV at the relatively high human body temperature of 37\u00b0C.

The magnitude of \u0394S a_immob merely positions the C.V T curve relative to the temperature scale with less negative values of \u0394S a_immob shifting the curve to higher temperatures ( Fig. 5b) such that high C.V T values are maintained at progressively higher temperatures as \u0394S a_immob becomes less negative (Fig. 5c) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 368, "text": "(Fig. 5a", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 521, "end": 530, "text": "(Fig. 5b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 712, "end": 720, "text": "Fig. 5b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 837, "end": 846, "text": "(Fig. 5c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "A less negative \u0394S a_immob maintains virus binding at higher temperatures"}, {"text": "The thermodynamic model here suggests that a large negative \u0394C p for HIV Env:CD4 diminishes binding at higher temperatures.

Furthermore, a large negative \u0394S a_immob imposes additional constraints on virus binding at higher temperatures exacerbating the reduced strength of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Therefore other mechanisms may be needed by the virus to achieve binding at 37\u00b0C. These could include more GP/Cr contacts at higher temperature (Frey et al., 1995; Harada et al., 2004 ). An alternative strategy evolved by viruses could be to make \u0394S a_immob itself less negative such that virus binding is maintained at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. Two possible evolutionary strategies are suggested here which could make \u0394S a_immob less negative. The first is decreasing the size of the virus and the second is the use of non- Fig. 6 .

Thus the shift in the K a_virus_T curve to higher values with a less negative \u0394S a_immob in Fig. 5a is consistent with HIV attachment factors augmenting infection (Wilen et al., 2012) . Indeed with n = 3 Env:CD4 contacts, significant binding of HIV to host cells is only achieved at 37\u00b0C if \u0394S a_immob is increased to > \u2212280 J/ mol/K (Fig. 5c) . \u0394S a_immob is estimated here to be \u22121091 J/mol/K for HIV. Thus the prior non-specific binding of HIV would need to realise a \u0394S a_non_specific of \u2212810 J/mol/K for subsequent effective Env:CD4 binding at human body temperature according to the model such that \u0394S a_non_specific in Eq.

Again this is consistent with the model here when it is noted that the C.V T value of <1 CD4 + T cell with bound virus in Fig. 5b is not a threshold and merely represents 1 mm 3 of blood.

Figure 9 of Antoine et al. (2012) shows a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) bound to a tetrahedral nanoparticle of zinc oxide (ZnO) called a zinc oxide tetrapod (ZnOT). The mechanism behind the ability of ZnOTs to prevent, neutralize or reduce HSV-2 infection relies on their ability to bind the HSV-2 virions (Antoine et al., 2012) . The ZnOT being some 40 \u00b5m in size is much larger than the attached virion which could still attach to a host cell surface in terms of spatial considerations. However, the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for an HSV-2 virion bound to a ZnOT nanoparticle would be very large and negative, indeed much more negative than for \u0394S a_immob for a free HSV-2 virion. Thus according to Fig. 5c , binding of HSV-2/ZnOT to host cells would be greatly diminished particularly at the human body temperature due to the very large negative \u0394S a_immob . Although \u0394S a_immob changes logarithmically (i.e. slowly) with virus size according to Eq. (18), the number, C.V T , of cells with bound virus is very sensitive to changes in \u0394S a_immob at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 5c) . It is proposed that antiviral research should take into account and even focus on making the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob more negative in addition to looking at conventional approaches to block the GP/Cr interaction. The advantage of focusing on \u0394S a_immob is that only one ZnOT nanoparticle has to bind to a virus to markedly affect \u0394S a_immob , while a large proportion of the GP molecules on the virus have to be bound with inhibitors, including neutralising antibodies, to block virus binding (Klasse 2012) and hence eliminate \u0394H a_receptor_T0 in Eq. (11). The temperature dependence of virus diffusion in mucus (Erickson et al., 2015) could also be considered not only in mechanistic dose-response models for viral infection at mucosal epithelial membranes in the intestine (Gale 2018) but also in terms of therapeutics when combined with the thermodynamic approach developed here. Normal, acidic cervicovaginal mucus greatly hinders the movement of virions of HSV and HIV, whereas mucus that is neutralized by semen provides a much less effective barrier against the same virions (Erickson et al., 2015) . Thus binding of the HSV or HIV virion to a ZnOT particle may not only decrease its diffusion coefficient in mucus but also make the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob more negative hence reducing the binding affinity of those virions which do make it through the mucus to the epithelial cell surface at human body temperature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 276, "end": 297, "text": "Antoine et al.

Although the K d_receptor_T value for the Env trimer:CD4 interaction (1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M, Chuang et al., 2017) is 15-fold higher than that for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction (0.9 \u00d7 10 \u221210 M, Table 4 ) at 25\u00b0C, this is close enough to support using the gp120 monomer:CD4 data, particularly as K d_receptor_T values for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction vary nine-fold between two HIV strains (see above).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 166, "text": "Myszka et al.

This is unexpected on the basis of the \u0394H a_receptor_T values reported by Myszka et al. (2000) for gp120:CD4 which become less negative with decreasing temperature (Fig. 1) . However, according to Eq. (6) the predicted \u0394S a_receptor_T term becomes more favourable (less negative) with decreasing temperature and it is therefore the entropy term that facilitates the tighter binding of gp120 to CD4 at lower temperatures. Unfortunately Myszka et al. (2000) only give the full range of values for \u0394H a_receptor_T (Fig. 1) with no data for \u0394S a_receptor_T over the range of temperature. However, Myszka et al. (2000) do give some graphical data from which \u0394S a_receptor_T at 25\u00b0C can be estimated and it is reassuring this \u0394S a_receptor_T is much less negative at \u2212473 J/mol/K than that of \u2212691 J/mol/K measured at 37\u00b0C and furthermore is actually less negative than the value of \u2212492.8 J/mol/K predicted for 25\u00b0C by Eq. (6) ( Table 4) and used in the model in Fig. 5 . This is strong experimental evidence that warming to 37\u00b0C and above does indeed give a significant reduction in the binding affinity of Env to CD4 as borne out by the 52-fold increase in the K d_receptor_T value for gp120:CD4 on warming from 25\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C as calculated from the actual data of Myszka et al. (2000) (Table 4 ). Furthermore it suggests that the actual increase in K a_virus_T on cooling from 37\u00b0C down to 25\u00b0C may be greater than that predicted by the model in Fig. 5a . The decrease in binding affinity with increasing temperature for HIV Env:CD4 is also supported by experimental data of Moore and Klasse (1992) which showed that soluble CD4 dissociated from HIV virions at temperatures above 35\u00b0C. Similarly Doranz et al. (1999) demonstrated that gp120 bound to CD4 + T cells began to dissociate at temperatures above 45\u00b0C. The data of Frey et al. (1995) in Fig. 6 offer further validation of the model in that the binding of HIV Env-expressing cells to cells expressing CD4 decreases substantially at 37\u00b0C as predicted by the model. The Env trimer is stable up to at least 60\u00b0C (Chuang et al., 2017) suggesting it is not denaturation of the Env trimer itself that is responsible for the decreased binding at higher temperatures. However, care has to be taken in using Eqs. (4) and (6) to predict \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T respectively down to very low temperatures. Thus although the predicted value of K d_receptor_T for gp120:CD4 at 4\u00b0C is 3700-fold lower than that at 37\u00b0C (Table 4) , Frey et al. (1995) cite some studies which suggested weaker binding of soluble CD4 to HIV virions at 4\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C. Without actual binding data for HIV over the full temperature range, it cannot be ruled out that K a_virus_T does not exhibit a peak with temperature as for the WEEV binding in Fig. 3b . Indeed, binding of 125 Ilabelled gp120 to T cells peaked at 16\u00b0C with binding at 4\u00b0C much lower than that at 37\u00b0C (Frey et al., 1995) . The observed increase between 4\u00b0C and 16\u00b0C is unlikely to be due to increased fluidity of the membrane allowing recruitment of more CD4 molecules because unlike the virus, each gp120 only binds a single Cr molecule. Dimitrov et al. (1992) showed that the activation energy for binding of soluble CD4 to cells expressing HIV Env changed at 18\u00b0C suggesting 18\u00b0C is a transition temperature. This could explain the peak in binding of gp120 at 16\u00b0C reported by Frey et al. (1995) . Thus extrapolation of \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T through Eqs. (4) and (6), respectively to temperatures below 18\u00b0C may not be justified in the case of HIV binding.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 204, "text": "Myszka et al.

The infection process may represent a bottleneck such that only one or two viral variants in the exposure dose successfully establish infection (Bull et al., 2011) . Thus in the case of norovirus, only minor variants at frequencies as low as 0.01% were successfully transmitted to establish a new infection (Bull et al., 2012) . The work here suggests that the actual size of the virion itself may present an additional constraint particularly at mammalian body temperatures. Thus although the average diameter for HIV virions with a single core is 134 nm, individual virions display a broad range of diameters extending from 120 to 200 nm with a skewed distribution (Briggs et al., 2003) . Furthermore while the majority of HIV virions contained a single core, almost a third contained two or more cores. The mean diameter of the HIV virions containing a single core (134 \u00b1 11 nm, n = 89) was significantly smaller than the mean diameter of virions containing two cores (158 \u00b1 16 nm, n = 43) (Briggs et al., 2003) . Thus the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob may vary between individual HIV virions within the same exposure dose.

Thus smaller diameter viruses in a challenge does may have an advantage in binding and hence initiating infection at mammalian body temperatures. This also raises the question of the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for an aggregate containing several virions of the same virus and in the case of EBOV, for the long filaments linking multiple genome copies (Beniac et al., 2012) . It has previously been proposed that fusing multiple genome copies into the same filament in the case of EBOV takes some of the entropy loss for \u0394S a_immob prior to binding to the cell surface (Gale 2017) such that aggregation can be viewed as a cooperative effect in the infection process.

It is proposed here that non-specific binding of HIV as the virus first randomly attaches to a host CD4 + T cell surface takes a large proportion (represented by \u0394S a_non_specific ) of the entropy loss of \u0394S a_immob such that HIV can then bind specifically through Env:CD4 interactions at the relatively high temperature of the human body. The randomly attached virus \"rolls into place\" driven by n = 3 specific Env:CD4 interactions resulting in a further entropy loss (\u0394S a_specific ) as the virus particle takes up a specific orientation ready for viral entry.

Bacterial cells are larger than viruses and \u0394S a_immob would be expected to be more negative. Targeting \u0394S a_immob may also have application as an alternative approach to antibiotics for bacterial pathogens when bacterial pathogenesis depends on attachment to cells.
