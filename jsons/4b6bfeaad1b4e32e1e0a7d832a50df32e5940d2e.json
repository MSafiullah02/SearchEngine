The dominant and regionally ubiquitous weeds in the wheat field that was selected for the study were Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, Melilotus albus, Phalaris minor and Rumex dentatus. Taller weeds, such as C. album and P. minor, constituted one group along with the crop, with a low photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen mass basis, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and leaf area ratio, in comparison to shorter weeds, such as A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus, which formed another group with a high photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen mass basis, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic nitrogenuse efficiency and leaf area ratio. Interspecific variations in the photosynthetic rate were driven mainly by variability in the specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content. The taller weeds and the crop had a low specific leaf area later in the season, whereas the smaller weeds had a relatively high specific leaf area, which might be an adaptation to the shaded environment below the canopy. The result indicates that any weed management in the wheat fields of the Indo-Gangetic Plains will need two different approaches because of the different strategies followed by the two weed groups that were identified in the present study.",

In India, weeds account for \u223c37% of the total annual loss of agricultural produce from various pests (Yaduraju 2006) . Acting at the same trophic level as the crop, weeds capture the available resources that are essential for crop growth. Thus, leaving weeds uncontrolled will eventually lead to a significant reduction in crop yield and quality. The features that confer competitive superiority to weeds are vigorous shoot and root growth, rapid leaf canopy development, architecture, height, rates of transpiration, photosynthesis and con-ductance, water use efficiency (Patterson 1995) and high growth rate (Mohler 2001) .",

Phalaris minor Retz. among the grassy weeds and R. dentatus L. among the broad-leaved weeds are of major concern in India ( Balyan & Malik 2000; Chhokar et al. 2006) . The dominance of these two species is influenced by tillage practices as continuous zero-tillage has been shown to lower P. minor incidence and increase the build-up of R. dentatus (Sharma et al. 2004; Tiwari et al. 2007) . Alarmingly, P. minor has developed extensive isoproturon resistance due to the latter's continuous use (Yaduraju 1999; Chhokar et al. 2006) . Similarily, C. album L., considered to be among the first five most important weeds in the world, is becoming a serious threat due to the origin of its herbicide-resistant races (Aper et al. 2010) . Singh et al. (2008) discussed the dynamics of the functional groups of weed flora in wheat fields of the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains on the basis of life form. However, it is necessary to further characterize the weed flora based on their ecophysiological traits that determine their pattern of resource capture and competitive ability. Ecophysiological traits regulate ecosystem processes (Wardle et al. 1998; D\u00edaz et al. 2004) , actively influence ecosystem properties, such as resource availability and dynamics, and determine the resource capture ability of any competing species (Kropff et al. 1992) . Studies indicate that species with high rates of photosynthesis, transpiration and decomposition have a fast growth rate (Chapin 1993) . Similarly, the specific leaf area (SLA) has been shown to correlate positively with traits that allow the plant to acquire external resources rapidly (Poorter & Garnier 1999) . According to Storkey (2006) , species with a similar ecophysiological profile will have a similar function in terms of competition.",

The Kundan variety is a high-yielding (4.0-4.5 t ha \u22121 ), semidwarf variety of wheat. Its life cycle continues for \u2264125-130 days after sowing (DAS). These fields had been subjected to the same treatments, as described below, for the past 12 years and followed a rice-wheatfallow crop rotation. The fertilizer application of NPK followed the regional practices. The basal treatments of KCl and P 2 O 5 were applied at the rate of 80 and 40 kg ha \u22121 , respectively, P 2 O 5 being applied in the form of single superphosphate and KCl being applied in the form of potash at the time of sowing. Nitrogen was applied as urea at the rate of 120 kg N ha \u22121 in three split doses. The first dose of urea (40 kg N ha \u22121 ) was applied at the time of sowing; other two doses (40 kg N ha \u22121 ), were applied as top dressing during the active tillering (30 DAS), and flowering stages (60 DAS) of wheat, respectively. In order to avoid water shortages until harvest, the plots were surface-irrigated weekly. The weeds were allowed to develop in the wheat plots without physical and chemical control.",

            "text": "The results that were obtained in this study have led to a functional grouping of weeds of wheat fields based on the ecophysiological traits that determine their pattern of resource capture ability in space and time. Species within the same group were similar in terms of their morphology, as well as physiology, and adopted similar strategies for growth and reproduction. Taller weeds, such as C. album and P. minor, constituted one group along with the crop, having a low A, SLA, LNC m , chlorophyll, PNUE and LAR in comparison to the shorter weeds, such as A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus, which formed another group with a high A, SLA, LNC m , chlorophyll, PNUE and LAR. This might be related to their shorter life span compared to taller weeds, which emerge with the crop (Om et al. 2004; Singh 2012) and continue till crop harvest. Although the shorter weeds emerge later in the season and complete their life cycle early, for their survival they have to face intense competition from the crop and taller weeds, particularly for light. Therefore, a high SLA, PNUE, LNC m and other supporting traits ensure their survival. Besides this, these traits also provide the smaller weeds with a benefit during light competition. Although being tall is beneficial for light competition, it demands a cost for plants. According to Nagashima and Hikosaka (2011) , as the plant's height increases, its need to invest biomass more than proportionately in the stem to support its own weight increases, which in turn reduces the fraction of leaf mass in the plant and thus C gain. However, a smaller plant increases its biomass allocation to the green parts and increases its SLA and other leaf traits, which results in increased light acquisition efficiency (intercepted photon flux per unit aboveground mass) (Kamiyama et al. 2010) . The direct and indirect effects of the SLA, LAR, LMR and leaf chlorophyll content on the photosynthesis of the two identified groups, as derived from a path analysis, are shown in Figure 3 . The study indicates that the SLA and LAR together were able to influence photosynthesis in the group 1 species (A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus), which had a high SLA, leaf N and chlorophyll content. However, the LMR, by modulating the chlorophyll content, influenced the photosynthesis of the group 2 species (C. album, P. minor and wheat), which had a low SLA, leaf N and chlorophyll content. Any change in the SLA relates to actual changes in the leaf structure and chemical composition. A lower SLA could be associated with slower intercellular diffusion of CO 2 (Parkhurst 1994; Hikosaka et al. 1998; Poorter & Evans 1998) or with greater internal shading of chloroplasts by attenuating photons passing through the lamina (Terashima & Hikosaka 1995) , either of which could decrease the A of a leaf. The SLA is also associated with N allocation to photosynthesis (Poorter & Evans 1998) . The N allocation to carboxylation and bioenergetics increases with an increasing SLA (Hikosaka et al. 1998; Onoda et al. 2004) . Hikosaka et al. (1998) also found that the SLA is positively correlated with the fraction of leaf N in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO), a key enzyme of photosynthesis. This is because of the fact that \u223c60% of the leaf soluble proteins consist of RuBisCO, which is often regarded as the most limiting factor for biomass production (Evans & Seemann 1989; Takashima et al. 2004) .",

High-SLA species might allocate a lower fraction of leaf N to cell walls, leaving more N for photosynthesis, as compared with low-SLA species, and have a higher PNUE (Poorter & Evans 1998 ). This is evident by the fact that the high-SLA species in this study had a high PNUE (R 2 = 0.96, P = 0.002). Similarly to the present study, A has been positively correlated with LNC m and SLA in many studies Hikosaka 2010) . According to Reich et al.

According to Storkey (2005) , at the lower light levels early in the season, species with a high SLA have a high RGR. As the light intensity increases, however, it becomes more advantageous to have a lower SLA to increase the capacity of individual leaves to absorb light. This will be more important for the taller species and there appears to be a general trade-off between plant height later in the season and the SLA (Storkey 2005) . This also was observed in the study, as the taller weeds (C. album and P. minor) and the crop (wheat) had a low SLA later in the season. Plants with internodes, such as Chenopodium and many grasses, have been shown to display a very rapid (within minutes) increase in the rate of elongation growth of the stems after initiation of a simulated shade treatment (see references in Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2010) . These alterations are accompanied by changes, including a reduced chlorophyll content, hyponastic leaves, increase in apical dominance (leading to reduced branching in dicots and tillering in grasses) and acceleration of flowering (Casal et al. 1990; Kebrom & Brutnell 2007) . Also in this study, C. album, P. minor and wheat had a lower chlorophyll content, compared to A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus.",
