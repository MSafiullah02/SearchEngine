A lot of viruses that cause severe diseases are RNA viruses, such as MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, Zika virus, influenza virus, and HIV (Sands et al., 2016). Other than antibodies and specific vaccines, the treatments for viral diseases are still limited now. Moreover, effective antibodies and vaccines are not available in many cases because of the high variation of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new strategies to defend against RNA viral infections in mammals.",

It hence gives rise to the inspiration of adapting the CRISPR/Cas system for human or mammalian animal cells to defend against foreign DNAs and viruses intracellularly (Burley and Sedgley, 2012; Heidelberg et al., 2009). Many tools utilizing the CRISPR/Cas system to disrupt genes or introduce coding sequence changes at the DNA level have been successfully developed (Samanta et al., 2016). However, tools for disrupting or editing RNA molecules are still limited until recently. The discovery of the type VI CRISPR/Cas system (Cas13) sheds light on RNA-guided RNA targeting. Four members of the Cas13 protein family have been identified, including Cas13a (Abudayyeh et al., 2017), Cas13b (Smargon et al., 2017), Cas13c (Gootenberg et al., 2017) and Cas13d (Konermann et al., 2018). The CRISPR/Cas13a system has been used to interfere with plant RNA viruses in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana (Aman et al., 2018a, b), and the CRISPR/Cas13b system has been reported to have the potent antiviral activity against multiple single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses in the cell culture system (Freije et al., 2019). A study has shown that the efficiency of transcript knockdown mediated by Cas13d is significantly higher than that of both Cas13a and Cas13b (Konermann et al., 2018).",

We chose the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model to test the hypothesis.

Seven 30-bp oligonucleotides, including one random sequence as the non-target guide RNA (gRNA) control (NC-gRNA) and six gRNA sequences targeting ORF4 (ORF4-gRNAs) or ORF5 (ORF5-gRNAs), were synthesized and cloned into gRNA-expression vectors, respectively (Fig. S1A).

At 48 hours post-transfection (hpt), the fluorescence protein expression of mCherry-ORF4 in cells transfected with NLS-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNAs was significantly decreased (Fig. 1\nA). Further qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression levels of mCherry-ORF4 were significantly decreased by 96%, 90%, and 95% by ORF4-gRNA1, ORF4-gRNA2, and ORF4-gRNA3, respectively (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1 B).

These results indicated that the CRISPR-Cas13d system possesses marked RNA cleavage efficiency in HEK293FT cells.

Since RNA viruses are mainly located in the cytoplasm of infected cells, we designed an NES-Cas13d expression vector via separately fusing two NESs to the N- and C-termini of Cas13d and used the NLS-Cas13d and NLS-dCas13d expression vectors as controls (Figs. S1A and S2A). 500 ng Cas13d expression vectors and 500 ng gRNA expression vectors were transfected into Marc145 cells in a 24-well plate using the Lipofectamine LTX Plus transfection reagent with an average transfection efficiency of 50%. At 12 hpt, GFP-PRRSVs at a MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.01 were added to the cells. At 48 hours post-infection (hpi), the fluorescence protein expression of GFP-PRRSV was significantly decreased in cells transfected with the NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1 compared with the control cells transfected with NLS-Cas13d/NC-gRNA (Fig. 1C). The mRNA expression levels of PRRSV-ORF4 and PRRSV-ORF5 were significantly decreased by 64% and 58% in cells transfected with the NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1 cells (P < 0.001), respectively, compared with the control cells transfected with NLS-dCas13d/NC-RNA (Fig. 1D). The fluorescent intensity of GFP-PRRSVs in the NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1 groups was significantly decreased compared with the NES-Cas13d/NC-gRNA control group (P < 0.001; Fig. S2B). Therefore, we concluded that NES-Cas13d significantly interfered in PRRSV RNA synthesis in Marc145 cells.",

Previously studies have shown that upon crRNA-mediated recognition of its complementary target sites, both Cas13a and Cas13b transit to an activated state, in which they exhibit a non-specific RNA endonuclease activity termed trans-cleavage (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016; Myhrvold et al., 2018; Smargon et al., 2017). To investigate whether off-target events exist, we blasted ORF4-gRNA1 and ORF5-gRNA1 against the human reference genome, and selected MAGI1 and NUP210 (having a high similarity with ORF4-gRNA1) and CPEB2-AS1 and F11-AS1 (having a high similarity with ORF5-gRNA1) to examine the off-target effects in HEK293FT cells transfected with NLS-Cas13d/mCherry-ORF4/ORF4-gRNA1 or NLS-Cas13d/mCherry-ORF5/ORF5-gRNA1 by qRT-PCR. The results showed that there were no significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of MAG1, NUP210, CPEB2-AS1, and F11-AS1 between the NLS-Cas13d/gRNA group and the NLS-dCas13d/gRNA control group (Fig. S3A). In addition, we used MTT assays to examine the cell viability of the Marc145 cells transfected with NLS-Cas13d/mCherry-ORF4/ORF4-gRNA1 or NLS-Cas13d/mCherry-ORF5/ORF5-gRNA1, and found that there were no significant cell viability changes between the Cas13d/gRNA- and dCas13d/gRNA-transfected cells (Fig. S3B). Together, these results indicated the CRISPR/Cas13d system used in this study has little or no significant off-target effects.",

            "text": "Viral infections underlie a variety of different diseases impacting both public health and agricultural industries greatly. In this study, we focused on the antiviral capacity of the CRISPR/Cas13d system and presented a new strategy for mammalian RNA virus interference. Interference efficiency, specificity, and applicability are the main concerns of RNA virus editing tools. Our results showed that NLS-Cas13d combined ORF4-gRNA1 or ORF5-gRNA1 cleaved 96% of mCherry-ORF4 mRNA or 84% of mCherry-ORF5 mRNA (Fig. 1B). The efficiency is equal to a previous report that Cas13d mediated a 97% knockdown of RNA viruses in Arabidopsis (Konermann et al., 2018). We also constructed a NES-Cas13d vector to localize mature Cas13d protein in the cytoplasm. Compared with the NLS-dCas13d/NC-gRNA control cells, the NES-Cas13d/gRNA significantly knocked down the GFP-PRRSV expression in Marc145 cells (decreased by 64% by NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and decreased by 58% by NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1), while NLS-Cas13d/gRNA did not show significant viral RNA cleavages. The viral titers of GFP-PRRSVs collected from the supernatant of NLS-Cas13d/gRNA transfected cells were only slightly lower than those from the NLS-dCas13d/NC-gRNA transfected group and the NC group (a pure negative control without transfection) (Fig. 1D\u2012F). The possible reasons are: 1) the ssRNA genome of PRRSV is replicated and transcribed in the cytoplasm; 2) NLS-Cas13d proteins mature in the cytoplasm and then are localized in the nucleus; 3) the process of viral RNA cleavage is short. The viral RNA cleavage efficiency of NES-Cas13d was not as high as the reporter system, which might be due to the relatively low transfection efficiency and the low viral titer. After knocking down the mCherry-ORF4/5 mRNA expression by NLS-Cas13d/gRNA, we did not observe changes in the gene expression of the potential off-target endogenous genes and the cell viability of Marc145 cells (Fig. S3), indicating that the CRISPR/Cas13d system used in this study is safe for the host cells.",

            "text": "Currently, Cas13d may be the best RNA-targeting CRISPR enzyme for mammalian RNA engineering. Like other Cas13 proteins, the Cas13d enzyme can efficiently target virtually any RNA sequences without the need of a protospacer flanking sequence. Besides its high cleavage efficiency, the Cas13d enzyme also has a small enough size, making it suitable for adenovirus associated virus (AAV) packaging for further applications. Cas13d enzymes have a median length of 930 amino acids, making them 17%\u201226% smaller than other Cas13 proteins and 33% smaller than Cas9 (Yan et al., 2018). A study has shown that Cas13d can be used to modulate the splicing of endogenous transcripts without changing the host genome, and its size is small enough to fit within the packaging limit of AAV for in vivo delivery (Konermann et al., 2018). AAV can be one of the suitable ways to package, deliver, and express the CRISPR/Cas13d system for targeting RNA viruses in vivo in clinical trials of gene therapies in the near future. The life cycles of both RNA viruses and DNA viruses both require the RNA stage, the CRISPR/Cas13d system may be a feasible and efficient way for eukaryotic cells to defend against both RNA viruses and DNA viruses. Our results demonstrated that Cas13d is suitable for RNA virus inhibition, and it may be also a potential tool for DNA virus interference. Though CRISPR/Cas13d system is a potential tool for RNA virus inhibition, there still exits several resistances, such as the work mechanisms of the CRISPR/Cas13d system, how to ascertain the effective time of Cas13d, and how to deliver the CRISPR/Cas13d to the target cells when RNA viruses infect host.",
