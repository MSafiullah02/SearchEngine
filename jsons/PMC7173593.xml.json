In influenza virus A, the prototype of the family, the envelope projections consist of rod-shaped hemagglutinin (HA) and mushroom-shaped neuraminidase (NA) GPs, in a ratio of approximately 4:1 (Palese and Shaw, 2007), which carry subtype-specific antigenic determinants, the basis for antigenic grouping of influenza virus A. Depending on the genus, other viral envelope proteins include M2, NB, BM2 or CM2. M2 and BM2 make up the ion channels in the virus envelope and mammalian cells. The envelope proteins overlay a matrix of M1 protein, which plays an important role in determining virion morphology. The presence of the envelope makes orthomyxoviruses very labile under ordinary environmental conditions; the virions are sensitive to heat, extremes of pH and dryness, lipid solvents such as ether and chloroform and detergents such as sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).",

Depending on genus, virions contain a precise number of segments with a total genome size of 10\u201315 kb. Each segment occurs in the enveloped particle as a nucleocapsid with helical symmetry and the ends of each viral RNA (vRNA) segment forming a helical hairpin bound by the heterotrimeric RNA polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, PA), as depicted in Fig. 19.1B. The RNA molecules possess conserved and partially complementary 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-end sequences characteristic of the genus (Desselberger et al., 1980, Presti et al., 2009, Kulshreshtha et al., 2010, Hause et al., 2013, Bacharach et al., 2016), which function as the promoter for vRNA replication and transcription by the vRNA polymerase complex. The noncoding regions also include the messenger RNA (mRNA) polyadenylation signal and part of the packaging signals for virus assembly (Palese and Shaw, 2007). To date, the family Orthomyxoviridae is made up of seven genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus, Isavirus, Quaranjavirus and the newly proposed genus Influenzavirus D (Table 19.1\n). The novel orthomyxo-like virus Tilapia lake virus (TiLV), with 10 genome segments, likely belongs to a new unnamed eighth genus in Orthomyxoviridae (Bacharach et al., 2016). Phylogenetic relationships within the family are illustrated in Fig. 19.2\n.\n",

The orthomyxovirus genome encodes at least 12 proteins (see Table 19.2\n). The first five genome segments encode one protein each, except for Influenzavirus A, where in some strains, segment 2 encodes a second protein PB1-F2, varying in length from 11 to 90 amino acids (Chen et al., 2010), and a third protein PB1 N40, 718 amino acids long. The PB1-F2 protein has various lengths, amino acid sequences, cellular localizations and functions (promotes apoptosis, increases inflammation and regulates viral polymerase activity) in different strains, which result in strain-specific pathogenicity (Chen et al., 2010). The smaller genome segments encode 1\u20133 proteins each via spliced and bicistronic mRNAs (or leaky scanning) (Lamb and Horvath, 1991, Garcia-Rosado et al., 2008). The functions of the orthomyxovirus proteins are summarized in Table 19.3\n, using genus Isavirus as an example.",

            "text": "In orthomyxoviruses, depending on the genus, the first step in virus replication, virus attachment to cells occurs via a hemagglutinin (HA, HE, HEF or GP) binding to N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid on the host cell surface. In the case of the influenza A virus, different cells have different linkages of the carbon-2 of the terminal sialic acid to the carbon-3 or carbon-6 of a galactose residue, forming \u03b1-2,3- or \u03b1-2,6-linkages, which in turn determine the host range (Bouvier and Palese, 2008). The virus enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis and uncoating occurs through low pH-dependent fusion between the viral envelope and cell membranes (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2005, Pinto et al., 1992). Virus replication of orthomyxoviruses is unique in that the viral nucleocapsids are transported to the nucleus, where transcription by viral transcriptase (PB1 and PB2) occurs following capture of host heterologous nuclear RNA (8\u201315 nucleotides long) as primer (also referred to as \u201ccap snatching\u201d (Krug, 1991)). Thogotovirus differs from the other orthomyxoviruses in having capped viral mRNA without host-derived sequences at the 5\u2019 end (Weber et al., 1996, McCauley et al., 2012). Assembly of nucleocapsids occurs in the nucleus. Virus matures in cytoplasm by budding from the plasma membrane. When budding is complete, HA spikes continue to bind the virions to the sialic acid on the cell surface until virus particles are actively released by the receptor destroying enzyme (or sialidase) activity of the neuraminidase (NA) or esterase (HE, HEF). The NA also removes sialic acid residues from the virus envelope itself, which prevents viral particle aggregation to enhance infectivity (Palese and Compans, 1976).",

The genome of DIPs is defective, and they interfere with the replication of\nthe complete orthomyxovirus particles (Nayak et al., 1978, Tobita et al., 1986), resulting in reduced virus titers and possibly in virus persistence. Genomic segment reassortment occurs during mixed infections involving virus of the same species, but not between viruses of different types (eg, influenza A and influenza B) or those of different genera. Reassortment of HA and NA genes of human, swine and avian influenza viruses produces antigenic shift, resulting in new virus subtypes to which the human population is immunologically na\u00efve, which then cause pandemics (Ahmed et al., 2007). Antigenic diversity in influenza virus A in nature also occurs through accumulation of single-base mutations in HA and NA segments which produce antigenic drift, resulting in new virus strains that cause epidemics or epizootics. Reverse genetic systems have been established for Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus (reviewed by Neumann and Kawaoka, 2001; Hoffmann et al., 2002) and Isavirus (Toro-Ascuy et al., 2015), allowing the generation of genetically engineered orthomyxoviruses entirely from cloned complementary DNA (cDNA).\n",

            "text": "The clinical disease, infectious salmon anemia (ISA), in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was first recognized in Atlantic salmon in 1984 on the southwestern coast of Norway (Thorud and Djupvik, 1988), although the virus might have been present in Norwegian salmon farms as early as 1977 or 1978 (Nylund et al., 1995a, Devold et al., 2001). The situation developed into an epidemic, which peaked in 1990, forcing the Norwegian authorities to impose a series of biosecurity measures that significantly reduced but not eliminated disease outbreaks (H\u00e5stein et al., 1999). The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recognized the viral disease in 1990 and named it ISA, and it has been an OIE-notifiable disease ever since. The causative agent, ISAV, was first detected by electron microscopy and virus isolation from tissues of infected fish in 1995 (Dannevig et al., 1995a, Dannevig et al., 1995b), which allowed its molecular characterization (Falk et al., 1997) and subsequent classification to the family Orthomyxoviridae (Kross\u00f8y et al., 1999), genus Isavirus (McCauley et al., 2012). The disease was first reported outside Norway in 1996, in New Brunswick, Canada (Byrne et al., 1998, Mullins et al., 1998), although there is anecdotal evidence indicating that the virus was present in the Bay of Fundy by 1995. Subsequently, ISA outbreaks were reported in Scotland, in the Faroe Islands, Denmark, in Maine, and in Chile in 2007 (reviewed by Cottet et al., 2011). The economic impact of the disease was probably most apparent in Chile, where losses during the 2007\u201311 ISA outbreaks were estimated at about $1 billion (ie, 50% of the economic value of the industry) (Alvial et al., 2014). More recently, ISA outbreaks have occurred in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Canada (CFIA, 2014). ISAV is now endemic in fish populations in Norway, New Brunswick, Canada, Scotland, Faroe Islands, Maine and Chile, and virulent strains of the virus have been replaced by low-pathogenic variant ISAVs called ISAV-HPR0 viruses. The field disease has only been found in farmed Atlantic salmon and is characterized by high mortality with exophthalmia, pale gills, ascites and hemorrhagic liver necrosis, renal interstitial hemorrhage and tubular nephrosis. No natural outbreaks of ISA have been reported in fish other than farmed Atlantic salmon, although the virus can be detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in feral fish (Kibenge et al., 2004, Plarre et al., 2005, EFSA, 2012). Laboratory data on tissues and sera from farmed coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) indicated the existence of ISAV in Chile as early as 2000 (Kibenge et al., 2001a, Kibenge et al., 2002) with some fish showing jaundice, although no ISA outbreak was detected in neighboring Atlantic salmon farms (Smith et al., 2006). The virus has also been detected in apparently healthy farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Ireland in 2002 (Anonymous, 2002).",

            "text": "RNA molecules of members of the family Orthomyxoviridae possess conserved and partially complementary 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-end sequences characteristic of each genus. These conserved terminal nucleotide sequences are therefore useful for orthomyxovirus classification. In Influenzavirus A, the first 12 nucleotides at the 3\u2019 end and the first 13 nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end of noncoding regions (NCRs) in all the vRNA segments are highly conserved (Skehel and Hay, 1978, Robertson, 1979, Desselberger et al., 1980, de Wit et al., 2007, Bouvier and Palese, 2008, Wang and Lee, 2009). These partially complementary termini base pair form terminal panhandle structures (Hsu et al., 1987), which function as promoters by interacting with the viral polymerase complex during replication and transcription of vRNA (de Wit et al., 2007, Li and Palese, 1994, Hagen et al., 1994, Lee et al., 2003, Fodor et al., 1995, Luyjtes et al., 1989, Tchatalbachev et al., 2001). Moreover, the segment-specific NCR sequences may play important roles in virus virulence (Zheng et al., 1996) and in the rescue of influenza virus using the reverse genetics system (de Wit et al., 2007, Jackson et al., 2002). The sequences for the genomic ends of ISAV RNA have been reported only recently (Kulshreshtha et al., 2010, M\u00e9rour et al., 2011, Fourrier et al., 2011). To assist with comparison between different reports, we have adopted the following terminology: 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions (UTRs) when referring to the positive sense (cRNA), which correspond to 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 NCRs of the negative sense RNA segments (vRNA). The length of the 5\u2019 NCR in all eight ISAV segments is significantly longer than the corresponding 3\u2019 NCR. It is also variable in the different genome segments of the same ISAV strain and on the same genome segment in different ISAV strains, ranging from 67 nucleotides in segment 4 to 150 nucleotides in segment 3 (Table 19.3). Moreover, Kulshreshtha et al. (2010) was able to document the presence of intrasegment ISAV quasispecies based on sequence variation in the NCR sequences of the transcripts. However, the 3\u2019 terminal 7 nucleotides and the 5\u2019 terminal 11 nucleotides are highly conserved among the eight genomic segments in the different ISAV strains (3\u2032-UCGU/AUUC--------GUU/AAAAAA/UUGA-5\u2019) (Fig. 19.4\n). In the case of TiLV, the conserved NCR sequences of its 10 genome segments (Bacharach et al., 2016; see Fig. 19.7) differ from those of ISAV, which is consistent with both viruses from different genera. Of note is the strict conservation of the terminal 3 and 4 nucleotides at the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends, respectively, of vRNA in all orthomyxoviruses, which is indicative of a shared mode of replication requiring interaction of the viral ends with the polymerase complex (Fourrier et al., 2011).",

Thus, the full-length viral cDNA clones (having the entire coding and noncoding regions) of all eight ISAV RNA genomic segments were individually constructed into pUC57 under the control of the Atlantic salmon internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS-1) as a promoter flanked by the sequences of the hammerhead ribozyme in the 5\u2019 end and the hepatitis \u03b4 virus ribozyme in the 3\u2019 end, followed by the transcription terminator of the rabbit \u03b2-globin in pSS-URG (for plasmid for Salmo salar universal reverse genetics) plasmid, creating eight genomic plasmids. In addition, four plasmids expressing the four proteins (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) of the ISAV ribonucleoprotein complex under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were constructed. Transfection of ASK cells with the 12 plasmids resulted in the rescue of infectious recombinant ISAV (rISAV) 7 days posttransfection (Toro-Ascuy et al., 2015).",

It is now well established that sequence analysis of all eight genomic segments from different ISAV isolates consistently reveals two genotypes designated according to their geographic origin as European (Genotype I) and North American (Genotype II) (Godoy et al., 2008). Genotype I can be further subdivided into Genogroup 1 (European\u2013in-North America, EU-in-NA) for Genotype I strains also found in North America, and Genogroup 2 (Real European, Real-EU) for Genotype I strains only found in Europe and Chile (Kibenge et al., 2009).

            "text": "Because the two ISAV genotypes correlated to antigenic groupings, they were designated as HA subtypes (Kibenge et al., 2001b). The two HA subtypes of ISAV have nucleotide sequence identities of \u226480.4% and amino acid sequence identities of \u226488.2%, whereas within each subtype, both sequence identities are \u226590.7% (Marshall, 2003). For influenza A virus, which has up to 18 different HA subtypes, amino acid sequence identities for isolates belonging to different subtypes can range from 25% to 80% (Nobusawa et al., 1991, Kawaoka, 1991, Wright et al., 1995, Shekel and Wiley, 2000). Thus, the HA protein of ISAV shows less variation than that of the influenza A virus. Limited virus neutralization tests with rabbit antisera to ISAV isolates of Real-EU genogroup (Genotype I, Genogroup 2) and North American genotype (Genotype II) showed at least three HA subtypes of ISAV: (1) North American, (2) Real-EU and (3) EU-in-NA (Kibenge et al., 2004). Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences in the HE protein of selected ISAV isolates identified the putative antigenic motif around the common potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid positions 333NIT335 with one mutation site at positions 320 to 323 on one side and a second mutation site at positions 339 to 367, between European and North American genotypes. The HE protein of ISAV isolates of EU-in-NA genogroup has an additional unique potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid positions 362NQT364 (Marshall, 2003). The presence of the additional carbohydrate chain in this region may be the basis for a new epitope accounting for EU-in-NA genogroup being antigenically distinct from the Real-EU genogroup (Kibenge et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Strain designation of ISAV is currently based on sequence deletions in the 35-amino acid HPR of the HE protein encoded on segment 6. The virulent strains of ISAV, designated ISAV-HPR\u0394, have deletions in HPR of the HE protein and are named numerically from HPR1 to \u2265HPR30, with two of them (HPR20 and HPR21) of North American genotype and the rest of them of European genotype (Nylund et al., 2007, Kibenge et al., 2009). The low pathogenic or nonvirulent strains of ISAV designated ISAV-HPR0, have a full-length sequence (35 amino acids) of HPR (Cunningham et al., 2002) and are considered to have an ancestral relationship with ISAV-HPR\u0394 (EFSA, 2012). Using multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of segment 6 sequences from all ISAV-HPR0 viruses reported worldwide, Godoy et al. (2013) identified three genomic clusters, which correlated with three residue patterns of ISAV-HPR0 (360PST362, 360PAN362 and 360PAT362) in HPR. The ISAV-HPR0 residue pattern 360PAT362 is the only type of ISAV-HPR0 found in Chile. The pathogenic ISAV isolates also have a mutation at the proteolytic cleavage site (267R) of the F protein (Markussen et al., 2008, Kibenge et al., 2009). This mutation, relative to the F protein of ISAV-HPR0, is either a single amino acid change from glutamine (226Q) to lecine (226L) or a peptide insert, named numerically from IN1 to IN5 (Godoy et al., 2014). IN1 to IN3 have been detected in Norwegian isolates (Devold et al., 2006) and IN4 and IN5 only in Chilean isolates (Kibenge et al., 2009, Godoy et al., 2014). Thus, there is still a need to devise an ISAV strain designation system that takes into account both envelope proteins (HE and F), which have been successfully used in genotyping of ISAV (Kibenge et al., 2009). Godoy et al. (2014), used concatenated ISAV F and HE genes of one representative isolate from every geographical region where ISA has been reported (ISAV isolates chosen: 98-049-1 represents North America; 04-085-1 represents EU-in-NA; 810/9/99 represents Norway I; 93/09/2264 represents Norway_II_1; SK779/06 represents Norway_II_2; U24636 represents Chile; and 390/98 represents Scotland) and constructed a phylogenetic tree that revealed the relationship between the different geographical isolates and possible transmission routes among the regions.",

            "text": "The replication strategy of ISAV resembles that of influenza viruses (Kibenge et al., 2004). The influenza viruses attach via their HA protein to host-cell receptors terminating in sialic acids (Zambon, 2001). Hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes from several fish species have indicated that ISAV also uses its HA protein to bind sialic acid receptors on the cell surface (Falk et al., 1997, Eliassen et al., 2000, Kristiansen et al., 2002, Workenhe et al., 2007). Structurally diverse sialoglycoproteins, as well as certain unique sialoglycoproteins, have been reported to occur in salmonid species (Iwasaki et al., 1990). Because ISAV agglutinates horse erythrocytes, and since these contain only N-glycol neuraminic acid, it has been suggested that this may be the cellular receptor for ISAV (Kristiansen et al., 2002). It was subsequently demonstrated that 4-O-acetylated sialic acid (Neu4,5Ac2) serves both as a substrate for the receptor destroying enzyme, a sialate-4-O esterase, and as a receptor determinant for virus binding (Helleb\u00f8 et al., 2004); hence, the designation of the ISAV HA protein encoded on segment 6 as a HA-esterase (HE) (Falk et al., 2004). The 4-O-acetylated sialic acid was recently shown to be the preferred receptor for ISAV in vivo as well (Aamelfot et al., 2012). Eliassen et al. (2000) and Aspehaug et al. (2005) demonstrated the internalization of ISAV into the endosomes and low pH-dependent fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, releasing the viral genome. The subsequent events in the ISAV infection cycle in a fish cell, including translocation of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes to the nucleus, transcription and replication of the viral genome in the nucleus, translation of viral transcripts in the cytoplasm, transport of the proteins to the nucleus and the surface GPs through the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum, through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex in the nucleus and subsequent transportation to the budding site of the plasma membrane with the surface GPs (Fig. 19.5\n), were reviewed by Cottet et al. (2011). ISAV replicates in cell culture without trypsin treatment. Moreover, unlike in influenza viruses, cleavage of the HA protein does not occur in ISAV (Kross\u00f8y et al., 2001). In influenza A viruses, amantadine specifically inhibits the M2 ion channel activity, and therefore viral ribonucleoprotein complexes are not released into the cytoplasm. However, amantadine did not have any effect on ISAV replication (Falk et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Permissive fish cell lines for ISAV include salmon head kidney (SHK-1) cells (Dannevig et al., 1995b), TO cells (Wergeland and Jakobsen, 2001) and Atlantic salmon kidney (ASK-2) cells (Devold et al., 2000) which are macrophagelike cell lines in which virus replicates with production of CPEs. Although all three cell lines are derived from the Atlantic salmon pronephros, they are distinctly different in their growth characteristics (media requirements, split ratio, cell composition), they display distinctly different viral-induced CPEs and also interact differently with virus-antibody mixtures during the virus neutralization test (Kibenge et al., 2004). The SHK-1 and ASK-2 cell lines are widely used for primary isolation of ISAV; however, at higher passages, they seem to lose sensitivity for ISAV, resulting in poorly defined and slow developing CPEs by some ISAV strains. Some strains of ISAV can also replicate and cause CPEs in the Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214) cell line (Bouchard et al., 1999, Kibenge et al., 2000, Griffiths et al., 2001) while others do not replicate in this cell line at all (Munir and Kibenge, 2004), thereby limiting their utility in virus isolation (Kibenge et al., 2000). Moreover, for cytopathic strains, the CPEs in CHSE-214 cells develop slowly, taking up to 17 days p.i. compared to 12 days p.i. in SHK-1 cells, and the virus yields are also lower (104.5 to 106.5 TCID50/mL) than on the SHK-1 cell line (Kibenge et al., 2004). TO (Wergeland and Jakobsen, 2001) and ASK-2 (Devold et al., 2000) cell lines develop more easily discernible CPEs in a shorter time (by 2\u20134 days p.i.) than do SHK-1 and CHSE-214 cells and give higher virus yields (as high as 109.1 TCID50/mL, Wergeland and Jakobsen, 2001; Grant and Smail, 2003). However, they do not recover viruses from some ISAV RT-PCR-positive samples (Kibenge et al., 2001a, Rimstad and Mjaaland, 2002, Mjaaland et al., 2002), indicating that the currently available fish cell lines are not permissive for all ISAV strains. Interestingly, Aamelfot et al. (2012) found the preferred ISAV cellular receptor only in the Atlantic salmon macrophagelike cell lines (ASK-2, SHK-1 and TO), but not in the CHSE-214 cell line. SHK-1 and ASK cell lines can be used in combination to provide an enhanced ability to detect ISAV (Rolland et al., 2005). Virus replication also occurs in Atlantic salmon (AS) (Sanchez et al., 1993, Sommer and Mennen, 1997) and rainbow trout gill (RTgill-W1) cell lines (Bols et al., 1994, Falk et al., 1997); but in these cases, the virus is noncytopathic and is detected by indirect fluorescent antibody testing (IFAT). The virus yield is very poor; the maximum viral titer reported in these cells was 103 TCID50/mL (Falk et al., 1997). Virus replication on FH-10, BB, EPC and BF-2 cell lines has also been attempted, but these cell lines appear to be refractory to ISAV (Falk et al., 1997, Byrne et al., 1998); the ISAV cellular receptor was not found in the EPC and BF-2 cell lines (Aamelfot et al., 2012).",

In a study using the permissive fish cell lines SHK-1, CHSE-214 and TO, Joseph et al. (2004) observed apoptosis only in ISAV-infected SHK-1 and CHSE-214 cells. ISAV-infected TO cells did not undergo apoptosis but showed leakage of high mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein from the nucleus, which is characteristic of cells undergoing necrosis (Scaffidi et al., 2002), suggesting that CPEs in these cells are associated with necrosis. ISAV-infected SHK-1 cells did not show leakage of the HMGB1 protein. Infection with two different strains of ISAV showed that the induction of apoptosis correlated with the appearance of CPEs in SHK-1 cells. The ISAV-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, indicating a caspase activation pathway. The ISAV putative PB2 protein and proteins encoded by RNA segment 7 specifically bound caspase-8 in vitro, suggesting that these viral proteins may have a role in the ISAV-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrated for the first time that the mechanism of cell death during ISAV infection was dependent on the cell type, which might have implications for ISAV pathogenesis and persistence. It was recently shown that ISAV infection promotes apoptosis of SHK-1 cells through ROS/p38 MAPK/Bad signaling pathway (Olavarr\u00eda et al., 2015).",

For example, it was suggested that ISAV may have been introduced to Norway with the importation of rainbow trout from North America (Kross\u00f8y et al., 2001). It has been suggested that there are natural reservoirs for the virus, probably in fish occurring in the coastal areas where ISA outbreaks frequently occur (Mullins et al., 1999). The virulence of ISAV is intrinsically linked to its emergence as a pathogen in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon. Thus, it is more likely that the emergence of ISAV as a fish pathogen is a reflection of variation in virus-host interactions similar to the situation with avian influenza in poultry. For example, domestic poultry (of the order Galliformes), are not the natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (Perdue et al., 1999, Suarez and Schultz, 2000). However, people have altered the epidemiological variables of avian influenza viruses by creating new ecological niches via bird captivity and domestication, industrial agriculture, national and international commerce and nontraditional raising practices (Swayne, 2000). In these new ecosystems, pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms can be transmitted within and between avian species (or fish species, in the case of ISAV) and adapt to new host species.",

It is now well established that the systemic disease ISA is caused by virulent ISAV strains (designated as virulent ISAV-HPR\u0394) with deletions in the highly polymorphic region (HPR) spanning residues 337V to M372 in the stem of the HE protein; these virus strains also have either an insertion or the 266Q\u2192266L mutation in the F gene (Kibenge et al., 2009). ISAV virulence in ISAV-HPR\u0394 may be attenuated by the absence of the insertion in the F gene (Godoy et al., 2014). However, while the deletion in HPR may be a good genetic marker for differentiation (Ritchie et al., 2009), it is not necessarily the virulence determinant for ISAV. Direct evidence for how the deletion in HPR affects virulence will be possible now that a reverse genetics system for ISAV has been developed (Toro-Ascuy et al., 2015).",

ISAV-HPR0 viruses have been variously reported in the research literature (Godoy et al., 2014). All ISAV-HPR0 isolates are characterized by the wild-type F protein with Q266 and no sequence insertion (Markussen et al., 2008). ISAV-HPR0 replicates mainly in Atlantic salmon gills, causing only transient subclinical infection (Christiansen et al., 2011). This virus has been detected in apparently healthy wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in most regions with Atlantic salmon aquaculture (Godoy et al., 2013) and is considered to have ancestral relationship with ISAV-HPR\u0394 (EFSA, 2012). ISAV-HPR0 viruses are detected late during ISA outbreaks and persist long after the disease is contained or eradicated (Kibenge et al., 2012b, Kibenge et al., 2009, McBeath et al., 2009, Christiansen et al., 2011). Most recently, ISA cases directly linked to the presence of endemic ISAV-HPR0 have been reported (Godoy et al., 2013), supporting the notion that under appropriate conditions, ISAV-HPR0 can mutate to ISAV-HPR\u0394.",

Mortality in a fish cage on a fish farm rises slowly and can vary from 0% to 90% (cumulative mortalities in Atlantic salmon during natural ISA outbreaks and experimental infections range from 0% to100%). The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05\u20130.1%), typically only in a few cages. Virus may be present in a fish cage for up to six months before significant mortality is noted. Stressful events such as handling of fish (eg, during sorting, treatment, splitting or moving of cages) may initiate disease outbreaks on infected farms. The dead fish have exophthalmos (bulging, bloodshot eyes), pale gills due to anemia, blood-tinged fluid in peritoneal and pericardial cavities (ascites), congestion of gut, enlargement of liver and spleen and petechial hemorrhages of the internal organs and membrane lining the abdominal cavity (Fig. 19.6\n). Histopathology lesions include intestinal mucosal ulceration and hemorrhage, liver hemorrhage and hepatocyte necrosis, erythrophagocytosis in the spleen and kidney, renal interstitial congestion, hemorrhage and tubular necrosis and congestion of branchial lamellar and filamental vessels (Byrne et al., 1998, Mullins et al., 1998, Thorud and Djupvik, 1988, Evensen et al., 1991, Godoy et al., 2008).",

            "text": "ISAV is known to cause overt and fatal systemic infection in farmed Atlantic salmon and asymptomatic infection in feral fish, a situation analogous to avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry and wild birds. The clinical ISA disease can also occur in wild, free-ranging Atlantic salmon, but these fish are less susceptible than the farmed Atlantic salmon either due to genetic variation in the two fishes or due to stress caused by management practices on the salmon farms (Nylund et al., 1995b). Experimental infection of Oncorhynchus spp., Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and herring (Clupea harengus) with ISAV resulted only in subclinical infection (Nylund et al., 1994, Nylund et al., 1995b, Nylund et al., 1997, Nylund et al., 2002, Nylund and Jakobsen, 1995, Rolland and Nylund, 1999, Devold et al., 2001). The Pacific salmonid species, chum (Oncorhynchus keta), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Chinnook (Oncorhynchus tsawytscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were also found to be resistant to experimental infection with ISAV, even at doses as high as 108 TCD50/mL that induced 98% mortality in Atlantic salmon (Rolland and Winton, 2003). Although attempts to isolate the virus from some of these fishes have not been successful, the virus can be detected by RT-PCR (Kibenge et al., 2004, Plarre et al., 2005). Detection of ISAV by RT-PCR has also been reported in the tissues of pollock (Pollachius virens) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), but only in fish collected from cages with ISA-diseased Atlantic salmon (Kibenge et al., 2004). Pollock were shown to be able to eliminate the virus within a week of experimental infection (Snow et al., 2002). Kibenge et al. (2006) reported that coho salmon (O. kisutch) can remain asymptomatic while being infected with strains of ISAV that are highly pathogenic to Atlantic salmon. Such benign infections in the wild fishery are considered to be the source of virulent strains that cause clinical disease in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Murray et al., 2002). The only other fish species conclusively shown to develop clinical disease and die due to ISAV infection are rainbow trout (O. mykiss) and Amago trout (Oncorhynchus masou macrostomus, an indigenous fish of Japan). In the case of rainbow trout, percentage mortalities of 10\u201350% were obtained following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections with highly pathogenic ISAV isolates (NBISA01 and RPC/NB 98-049-1 of North American genotype and 810/9/99 of European genotype) that caused 80\u2013100% mortality in Atlantic salmon (Kibenge et al., 2006, MacWilliams et al., 2007). Of the gross lesions reported for ISA in Atlantic salmon, only visceral adipose petechiation and ascites were commonly observed among the rainbow trout mortality (MacWilliams et al., 2007). Microscopic lesions in these rainbow trout included increased erythrophagia, clusters of cellular degeneration in the hematopoietic portion of the kidney and occasionally epicarditis, endocarditis and myocarditis. These lesions are very different from the typical necrosis in liver and kidney that occur in infected Atlantic salmon, and if they were viewed in rainbow trout under field conditions, it is unlikely that ISA would have been considered as a differential diagnosis (MacWilliams et al., 2007). Biacchesi et al. (2007) obtained 80\u2013100% mortality of genetically susceptible juvenile rainbow trout i.p. injected with ISAV isolate Glesvaer/2/90 of European genotype. The moribund fish displayed typical pathological signs of ISA, including exophthalmos, pale gills and abdominal congestion (Biacchesi et al., 2007). Cumulative mortalities of 95% and 20% occurred in i.p. injected Atlantic salmon and amago trout, respectively, with ISAV isolate Glesvaer/2/90 (Ito et al., 2015). However, there was no evidence of horizontal transmission of ISAV from moribund amago trout to coreared juvenile Atlantic salmon, although ISAV was detected by RT-PCR in surviving amago trout (Ito et al., 2015).",

(2012) demonstrated that only Atlantic salmon macrophagelike cell lines (ASK-2, SHK-1 and TO) have the ISAV cellular receptor, hence, their permissiveness for ISAV replication. These authors further investigated the presence of the ISAV cellular receptor on cells from a large number of marine and freshwater fish species with a view of identifying the ISAV host range in wild fish (Aamelfot et al., 2014). The study found that all salmonids expressed the receptor, but only some of the codlike and perchlike fish did, whereas all flat fish tested negative for the ISAV receptor (Aamelfot et al., 2014). However, the fact that CHSE-214 cells (which are permissive to ISAV isolates of North American genotype, Kibenge et al., 2000) do not have the ISAV receptor (Aamelfot et al., 2012) suggests that ISAV may use more than one cellular receptor (ie, the natural host for ISAV may include both salmonid and nonsalmonid species).",

Transmission between aquaculture farms can be linked to fish farming practices such as movement of feed boats and well boats carrying fish, and in ballast water, sharing of personnel and equipment (nets, barges, etc.), movement of infected fish, as well as movement of virus through the water column due to proximity to fish slaughterhouse processing plants or other fish farms. Recovered farmed Atlantic salmon can become carriers; 30% of ISA outbreaks in Norway were attributed to other farms in proximity. Aldrin et al. (2011) used seaway distances between farms and genetic distances between ISAV isolates of farms in Norway with ISA between 2003 and summer 2009 to predict the rate of ISA infection of salmon farms. The fitted model predicted that the risk of infection from a neighborhood infectious farm decreased with increasing seaway distance between the two farms. Furthermore, for a given infected farm with a given ISAV genotype, the source of infection was significantly more likely to be ISAV of a small genetic distance than of moderate or large genetic distances. Nearly half of the farms with ISA in the investigated period were predicted to have been infected by an infectious farm in their neighborhood, whereas the remaining half of the infected farms had unknown sources.",

Phylogenetic analyses of the Chilean ISAV isolates from different outbreaks suggested that the virus was introduced from Norway in 1996 (Kibenge et al., 2009), probably through fertilized salmon eggs (Vike et al., 2009, Cottet et al., 2010). Vertical transmission of ISAV was recently reported to occur with virulent ISAV-HPR\u0394 (Marshall et al., 2014), although it may be of little significance in the epidemiology of ISAV infection (Rimstad et al., 2007).",

            "text": "It is now well established that in Atlantic salmon, ISAV specifically targets endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in all organs (Falk and Dannevig, 1995, Koren and Nylund, 1997, Aamelfot et al., 2012), macrophages (Moneke et al., 2003) and red blood cells (Workenhe et al., 2008, Aamelfot et al., 2012). Thus, virus replication occurs in several organs particularly the heart, liver, head kidney and spleen, causing a generalized infection of the vascular system. Virus enters primarily via gills (Totland et al., 1996), but it also occurs through the mouth (Mikalsen et al., 2001). Atlantic salmon gill epithelial cells express 4-O-acetylated sialic acid, the preferred ISAV receptor, and the virus yield in primary gill epithelial cell cultures is comparable with that of SHK-1 cells (Weli et al., 2013). The most extensive and prolonged virus replication is in heart tissue (Moneke et al., 2003, Moneke et al., 2005). The virus is rapidly disseminated via the circulatory system (Nylund et al., 1995a, Rimstad et al., 1999). The nonpathogenic ISAV-HPR0 replicates mainly in Atlantic salmon gills, causing only transient subclinical infection (Christiansen et al., 2011). In contrast to the virulent ISAV-HPR\u0394 that targets endothelial cells, ISAV-HPR0 was shown to replicate only in the epithelial cells of Atlantic salmon gills (Aamelfot et al., 2016).",

Moneke et al. (2005) used in situ hybridization (ISH) with a riboprobe targeting ISAV segment 7 mRNA to study the correlation of virus replication in tissues with histologic lesions in Atlantic salmon experimentally infected with ISAV. Severe histopathological lesions were observed in tissues beginning at the onset of mortality and correlated with maximum intensity and frequency of ISH signals, particularly in the liver, kidney and heart. The distribution of ISH signals indicated the presence of a viremia, as signals were observed predominantly in individual blood cells and endothelial cells, and possibly hematopoietic cells of head kidney, but not in the necrotic hepatocytes and renal epithelium. Of the organs sampled, the heart was the first to show ISH signals, and the signals lasted longest in the heart, possibly due to increased activity of the endocardial endothelial cells and the underlining macrophages, which continuously trap and remove circulating virus, and therefore represents the best tissue sample for screening of suspected infected fish (Moneke et al., 2005). Kibenge et al. (2006) compared the infectivity of different ISAV isolates at a dose of 106 TCID50/0.2 mL/fish given intraperitoneally in three different farmed fishes (Atlantic salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout) and found that the most virulent strains caused the highest mortalities in Atlantic salmon (>95% mortality) with the shortest duration (9\u201312 days). These highly pathogenic ISAV strains also caused mortality in rainbow trout with systemic hemorrhagic lesions and an ISH pattern with ISAV riboprobes that were consistent with those typically seen in Atlantic salmon infected with ISAV (MacWilliams et al., 2007).",

Studies of host response to virus infections suggest that mammals and bony fish are more or less similar in the major mechanisms of both innate and adaptive immune responses against viruses (Workenhe et al., 2010). ISAV targets Atlantic salmon vascular endothelial cells and macrophages, is known to induce the innate type I IFN system, as well as adaptive immune response genes of Atlantic salmon (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2008, LeBlanc et al., 2010, Lauscher et al., 2011); and ISAV isolates have strain-specific variations in their ability to induce immune response genes (Workenhe et al., 2009, Svingerud et al., 2013), although the immune responses mounted do not restrict the replication of the virus (Kileng et al., 2007). A luciferase reporter assay utilizing Atlantic salmon Mx protein and minimal IFN promoter and transient expression of ISAV proteins showed that segment 7 ORF1 and segment 8 ORF2 proteins are major- and minor-IFN system antagonizing proteins, respectively (McBeath et al., 2006, Garcia-Rosado et al., 2008). Hetland et al. (2010) showed differences in the distribution of MHC I, MHC II and CD8 cell populations between control and ISAV-infected salmon that support the proposition that ISAV, as with influenza virus, activates CD8-positive T-cell responses.",

However, the immune adaptive response against ISAV following clinical disease appears to provide full protection against reinfection by different ISAV strains (Ritchie et al., 2009).

            "text": "The laboratory diagnostic assays for ISA include histological examination (Evensen et al., 1991, Speilberg et al., 1995, Byrne et al., 1998) and electron microscopy (Hovland et al., 1994) of fish tissues, the isolation of ISAV in SHK-1 (Dannevig et al., 1995a, Dannevig et al., 1995b), ASK (Rolland et al., 2005) and CHSE-214 cell lines (Bouchard et al., 1999, Kibenge et al., 2000) and electron microscopic examination of a positive isolate, the use of RT-PCR (Mjaaland et al., 1997, Devold et al., 2000) and IFAT on positive virus isolates or on tissue samples from suspected fish (Falk and Dannevig, 1995, Falk et al., 1998) and ISH on tissue samples from suspected fish (Gregory, 2002, Moneke et al., 2003). In addition, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect competitive ELISA that could detect ISAV-specific antibodies in the sera of infected and vaccinated fish have been described (Kibenge et al., 2002). An ultrasensitive real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method for ISAV was reported by Starkey et al. (2006). A one-tube real-time RT-PCR for ISAV using SYBR Green chemistry was first described by Munir and Kibenge (2004). The assay had a detection limit of 0.006 ng of ISAV RNA, could be completed in 80 min, and provided the potential to quantitate even noncytopathic virus in cell cultures. Several real-time RT-PCRs using TaqMan chemistry have been reported since then (Plarre et al., 2005, Snow et al., 2006, Workenhe et al., 2008, Kibenge et al., 2011, Christiansen et al., 2011). Godoy et al. (2010) used the real-time RT-PCR with TaqMan chemistry to detect vRNA in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. For the ISAV TaqMan assay, the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (OIE, 2014) recommends primer-probe sets targeting ISAV segments 7 and 8 developed by Snow et al. (2006). Most diagnostic laboratories use the Snow et al. (2006) primer-probe set targeting segment 8 (Kibenge et al., 2011, Kibenge et al., 2012a). Other laboratories and researchers have found the Plarre et al. (2005) primer-probe set targeting segment 7 to be more sensitive. Other researchers have published ISAV segment 8 primer-probe sets that are highly sensitive (Christiansen et al., 2011) but are not included in the OIE Manual (OIE, 2014). Most recently, it was suggested that using ISAV segment 3 real-time RT-PCR may be a more sensitive method of virus detection and quantitation (Valenzuela-Miranda et al., 2014). Routinely, once a clinical sample has been determined to be positive for ISAV, conventional RT-PCR with segment 6 primers (Kibenge et al., 2009) is commonly used to obtain a PCR product that is sequenced in order to determine the HPR type and genotype of the ISAV present.",

Because the discovery of a reportable disease is subjected to OIE trade standards, the presence of either ISA or ISAV infection often leads to expensive eradication or control efforts, and suspect populations may be quarantined until a definitive diagnosis can be made. Good management and increased biosecurity by fish farm managers in combination with early detection of infection through enhanced surveillance and use of rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are key to preventing ISAV spread. Due to the increase in demand for international trade of live, fresh and frozen fish, areas previously unaffected by ISAV are increasingly exposed to the potential spread of the virus. The OIE currently has three levels of official confirmation of infection with ISAV (OIE, 2014):\u25cf\nConfirmation of ISA: The following criteria should be met: detection of ISAV in tissue preparations by IHC on fixed sections or IFAT on tissue imprints or fixed sections in addition to either (1) isolation and identification of ISAV in cell culture from at least one sample from any fish on the farm or (2) detection of ISAV by RT-PCR by the methods described in the relevant sections of the OIE Manual (OIE, 2014).\u25cf\nConfirmation of HPR-deleted ISAV infection: The following criteria should be met: (1) isolation and identification of ISAV in cell culture from any fish sample on the farm or (2) isolation and identification of ISAV in cell culture from at least one sample from any fish on the farm with corroborating evidence of ISAV in tissue preparations using either RT-PCR or IFAT/IHC.\u25cf\nConfirmation of HPR0 ISAV infection: The following criteria should be met: detection of ISAV by RT-PCR followed by independent amplification and sequencing of the HPR of segment 6 to confirm the presence of HPR0 only.\n",

Control of ISA by vaccination has been used in North America (since 1999), Faroe Islands (since 2005), in most parts of Norway (since 2009) and in Chile (since 2010), although the currently available vaccines do not seem to offer complete protection in Atlantic salmon (Falk, 2014). It has been shown that the level of protection with ISAV-inactivated vaccines is correlated to the amount of ISAV antigen in the vaccine, and fish immunized with high antigen amounts produce detectable ISAV-specific and neutralizing antibodies and have protection with a relative percent survival (RPS) of as high as 86% (Lauscher et al., 2011). It has also been established that virus is more rapidly eliminated from vaccinated fish than from nonvaccinated fish (reviewed by Kibenge et al., 2012b). The unprecedented 2007\u201311 spread of ISA in the Atlantic salmon industry in Chile created a high demand for ISA vaccines, which resulted in improved vaccine products being developed and marketed in Chile (Murias, 2012). Up to six different vaccines, five of them being inactivated whole ISAV emulsified with adjuvant and administered by intraperitoneal injection and one oral vaccine (available for the Chilean market) are available commercially (Falk, 2014). However, the efficacy of these vaccines in the presence of the widespread ISAV-HPR0 infections is not known.",

This is bound to improve the efficacy of ISA vaccines. To date, there are two commercially available ISAV subunit vaccines (marketed by the Chilean pharmaceutical company Centrovet) based on ISAV HE protein expressed in yeast and delivered either in an oil-adjuvanted injection (monovalent or multivalent with Piscirickettsia salmonis, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus and Vibrio ordalii) or orally in feed as a bioadhesive cationic polysaccharide formulation (MicroMatrix, Harel, 2009) (monovalent or bivalent with P. salmonis) (Falk, 2014). Oral vaccination using a vaccine preparation containing conserved regions of recombinant ISAV HE and F proteins expressed in Sacharomyces cerevisiae and encapsulated in MicroMatrix-induced production of IgM-specific antibodies and protected against challenge with a high-virulence Chilean ISAV isolate but was unable to induce expression of the innate antiviral Mx gene (Caruffo et al., 2016). More innovative approaches for generation of novel and improved ISAV vaccines are continuously being undertaken. A salmonid alphavirus (SAV) replicon vaccine expressing ISAV HE was shown to offer protection against ISAV infection (Wolf et al., 2013). Neither the ISAV F nor the ISAV M proteins were found to be protective when similarly expressed (Wolf et al., 2013). When delivered by intramuscular injection, but not by intraperitoneal administration, the replicon vaccine provided high protection against subsequent ISAV challenge in Atlantic salmon and induced a strong innate response locally at the injection site, which may be beneficial and could warrant reduced doses and improved efficacy compared to conventional DNA vaccines (Wolf et al., 2014). Most recently, the development of a novel reverse genetics system for ISAV (Toro-Ascuy et al., 2015) now offers a powerful tool to develop a new generation of ISAV vaccines.",

The TiLV genome consists of 10 segments of linear, ssRNA of negative polarity, ranging in length from 465\u20131641 nt (see Table 19.3) with a total molecular size of 10.323 kb (Bacharach et al., 2016). Each segment has an open reading frame (see Table 19-2), and the NCRs of all 10 segments have been determined; 13 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 termini and 13 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 termini are similar in all segments, an organization similar to other orthomyxoviruses (Bacharach et al., 2016). The 3\u2032 terminal 5 nucleotides and the 5\u2032 terminal 6 nucleotides are highly conserved among the 10 genomic segments (3\u2032-CCAAAU/A/GUUA/U\nC/A /U\nC/U\nC/U -------GA/GGA/UAAG/A/UAUUUGC-5\u2032) (see Fig. 19.7\n). In addition, all the 5\u2032 ends of TiLV genomic RNA segments contain a short, uninterrupted uridine stretch (three to five bases long) (Bacharach et al., 2016), which is the polyadenylation signal sequence in orthomyxoviruses (refer to Fig. 19.4).\n",
