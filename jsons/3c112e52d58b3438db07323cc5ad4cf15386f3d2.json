Under the guidance of this strategy, local governments then adopted relevant measures to mitigate the disaster. Assessing the level of public satisfaction of the government's efforts means we must evaluate the overall performance of the government in mitigating this epidemic. The strategies made by the central government needed to be carried out by the local governments, and the extent to which measures were implemented directly affected the efficiency of prevention and control efforts. Therefore, the public's level of satisfaction of the local government's (including governments at the provincial, municipal, county, town and township level, and sub-district offices) overall performance in prevention and control is actually based upon their direct perception of how the measures were implemented in their local area.",

As can be seen in the data, individual characteristics within the public didn't significantly impact their assessment of the central government's response efforts, and it is evident that satisfaction with the state's efforts was prevalent among the masses. In regards to overall satisfaction, we investigated the impact demographics and other characteristics may have on the public's assessment. Using one-way analysis of variance, we found that factors such as gender, age, educational background, income, residence, experience with infectious disease, and having children had no significant impact on the level of satisfaction in regards to the central government's responses.

It's an important guarantee of a government's usefulness and its improvement, and enhancing this credibility is mutually beneficial for both the government and the public. Enhancing credibility can happen through the government proactively improving its performance, or it can happen through communication with the public. Therefore, we took two factors into consideration when assessing the state's prevention and control efforts and their impact on government credibility. One was measuring the level of trust, or change in trust by the public in their government's emergency response capabilities after they experienced the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak, which showed the impact of the state's emergency management response on the government's credibility. Second was measuring the level of public trust in the information provided by the government which showed the impact of communication on government credibility. In order to assess credibility in the state's prevention and control efforts, this assessment team measured the change in trust by the public after they experienced the Influenza A (H1N1) in regards to the central and local government's capabilities in emergency management. We also compared the level of trust during the SARS period with this epidemic. The results of the survey showed that the public generally expressed confidence in the government's emergency response capacity, and the public became significantly more trusting of local governments and their capabilities.",

The central government's credibility has been relatively high in regards to emergency response, with 77% of respondents expressing they had confidence or even more confidence than before in the government's capabilities. After experiencing the outbreak of Influenza A (H1N1), the ratio of respondents that felt \"no trust before, but now there is trust\" was much higher for local governments (30.6% of respondents) than for the central government (19.1%). Although the credibility of local governments overall was relatively lower, after the outbreak there was a significant increase in the trust in local governments' response capabilities. In the surveys, we asked respondents about the reliability of news from different sources including the central government, local government, experts, grassroots communities, village groups, working units, and news by word of mouth. The results clearly showed that during this epidemic, the public's most trusted news source was still the government, and the trust in the central government was higher than in local governments (as seen in Fig. 7 .5). Similar to the assessment on the public's satisfaction towards their government, demographic factors such as gender, age, educational background, income, family background, and residence had no significant impact on their perception of the government's credibility. What did make a significant impact on the perception of the credibility of the central government was whether the respondent or any of the respondent's family members had been infected in the past by a contagious virus. However, this one factor did not seem to have any significant impact on the respondents' confidence in their local governments. The government adopted relevant measures in each of the four distinct epidemic phases, and these measures included the following: customs health inspection, patient isolation, close contact isolation, class suspension where the virus was prevalent, the promotion of wearing masks and frequent hand washing, inoculations, more exercise, and the use of traditional Chinese medicine. The majority of the respondents recognized the need for these measures, especially the customs health inspection, patient isolation, close contact isolation, class suspension, and the promotion of exercise. Over half of the respondents felt that these measures were necessary as can be seen in Fig. 7 .6. It is clear that there was a wide acceptance by the public of these prevention and control measures and that the implementation personified humanistic care. However, Fig. 7 .7 shows that one third of the respondents felt that these measures were inconvenient to a certain extent for their daily routines. About 50% of the respondents felt that the measures adopted were appropriate in terms of their intensity, but the ratio of those who felt the measures partially strict did rise in the peak and slow periods of the epidemic (Fig. 7.9 ).",

Understanding the implementation of these prevention and control strategies for patients and close contacts, and understanding the attitudes, feelings, and levels of satisfaction from these affected people towards national strategies, will provide useful references for future emergency response policies. Based on the four different epidemic phases, we employed a stratified sampling method and conducted phone interviews with 893 patients and 646 close contacts from the three areas in the national disease monitoring information report management system: Beijing, Fujian, and Henan. The interview included topics covering implementation of quarantine and treatment policies during different epidemic phases, the implementation of discharge standard policies, the implementation of humanistic care policies, and medical treatment costs. We also investigated the attitudes of the close contacts in regards to medical observation management and humanistic care policy implementation. The study showed that 65% of patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with the national prevention and control efforts; 26% were neutral; and 9% were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied (Table 7 .2).",

The transition to the mitigation phase did take a little longer than in other countries as this decision took into consideration China's domestic realities. China's medical treatment capabilities are weaker than developed countries like the U.S., and thus the country needs to strengthen its first line of defense. However, this type of containment strategy expends a large amount of resources and manpower, and as soon as the epidemic spreads, containment is no longer efficient. In regards to vaccinations, China was the first developing country to successfully research and implement inoculations. The WHO offered guidance to many countries as well as information to help with decision-making, and China's prevention and control measures in many areas were quite stringent. The mainstream media did not provide a lot of judgments on the actions of the Chinese government for this epidemic, nor were there any clear criticisms. The majority of news reports were objective and rational, and simply covered the facts; there were few that provided any evaluations. In other words, most of the reports focused on a few key countries, including China, and provided introductions to the outbreaks, developments, and prevention and control efforts; there were very few that provided any assessments of these developments. In a sense, this phenomenon could mean that China's emergency management was suited to the task this time around which left little for the media to criticize. Taking into account mainstream media leans more towards \"criticism and not praise\" and the influx of criticism from foreign media for the SARS outbreak, we could interpret this phenomenon as a more positive international response to China's Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control efforts.",

Of course, the most intense criticism came from the Mexican government, especially the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa. She stated that the treatment of Mexican citizens in China was \"discriminatory\" and that some of the quarantined people were in \"unacceptable conditions.\" 1 U.S. Congress also criticized the isolation procedures by issuing tactful travel warnings. The isolation and medical detention adopted by China was called an \"offensive\" prevention and control measure in The New York Times, and China was also criticized for being inflexible, as the author felt these type of measures \"are easy to implement in authoritarian countries.\" 2 Other foreign professionals who experienced isolation measures also expressed their dissatisfaction. Psychiatry professor Jonathan M. Metzl from the University of Michigan felt that the isolation he experienced was \"against public health regulations and xenophobic in nature;\" he also felt that the isolation measures adopted were \"completely inappropriate.\" 3 Other public opinions felt that the measures were \"redundant.\" The Wall Street Journal also had criticisms on the state's actions: \"The government's attempts to quarantine all arriving passengers suspected of carrying H1N1-and those seated around them on aircraft-has been overzealous.\" 4 On the other hand, CNN stated in a report on September 16th that \"China has had perhaps the most extreme and active response to the virus than any other country in the world.\" 5 However, a considerable amount of public opinion also reflected an understanding of these measures. On November 11th, 2009, The New York Times quoted a U.S. school teacher who had been isolated in this passage: \"At the time, it seemed extreme, and it seemed restrictive, because I had never experienced an infectious disease outbreak. Now, looking back and seeing some of the measures that are being taken now in the U.S., the Chinese measures don't seem so extreme.\" 6 MSNBC also pointed out that, \"China was hit hard before by SARS, it's understandable as to why they are so worried about another outbreak of an infectious disease.\" BBC News also stated that \"This time the government has acted quickly and decisively.\" 7 In November 2009, the head of the WHO Office in Beijing officially approved of China's response measures to Influenza A (H1N1) stating, \"I think there were a variety of measures put in place by different countries, and it's difficult to say what worked best and what didn't, but China's has worked very well.\" 8 2",

Additionally, 95% of disease control professionals felt that the measures were an overall success, and 84% of close contacts along with 65% of patients expressed satisfaction towards the treatment they were given (The overall satisfaction of patients and close contacts was lower than the public's, which is understandable as they were the targets of these measures.

After they experienced Influenza A (H1N1), 96.1% of the public polled expressed trust in the central government's emergency response capabilities, and 94% of the public expressed trust in their local governments' emergency response capabilities. Compared with the time of SARS, 63.8% of the public trusted the central government's emergency response capabilities more and 58.1% expressed more trust in their local governments' emergency response capabilities, which shows significant improvement. In addition, 95% of close contacts and 82% of patients felt that the government made improvements in their public health emergency management.
