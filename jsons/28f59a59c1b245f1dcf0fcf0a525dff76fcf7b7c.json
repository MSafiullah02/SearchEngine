Grant-Kels, MD, Brett Sloan MD, Jonathan Kantor MD and In this issue of the JAAD, Freeman et al discuss the new COVID registry 8 launched by the American Academy of Dermatology with the support of the International 9 League of Dermatological Societies. Big data has tremendous potential to answer key 10 questions about manifestations of the infection, the influence of preexisting disease and 11 immunomodulating therapy, and the potential protective or negative effects of other 12 drugs administered for the treatment of chronic diseases. Without such data, we can 13 only guess at the effects of biologics, antimalarials and other agents. Registries have 14 tremendous potential to produce valuable data that could never be gleaned from single 15 institutions. We applaud the tremendous effort that went into the creation of this 16 valuable tool. 17 Also in this issue, authors report on the range of dermatological manifestations 18 associated with COVID-19. Dermatologists are experts in the diagnosis of viral 19 exanthems and play an important role in the response to the pandemic. In addition to 20 secondary findings associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and other 21 thrombotic events, a viral exanthem may occur in infected patients. In one report 20% 22 of infected patients had a skin manifestation and of that group 44% presented with a 23 rash at the onset. 1 The cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 that have been reported 24 are highly variable and include eruptions that are petechial 2 , erythematous, urticarial, 25 vesicular (varicelliform or chicken pox-like), and annular (in review). Manifestations 26 resembling perniosis have been reported in children and an eruption similar to Dengue 27 fever (white islands on a sea of red) can occur. Transient livedo eruptions have also 28 been reported. 3 29",
