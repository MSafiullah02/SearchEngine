However, its lag makes it difficult to timely catch the outbreak of epidemics. With the popularity of the Internet and smartphones, the focus of social media is often a sign of these major epidemic diseases. 5 Information and discussions on COVID-19 spread rapidly on social media, so the use of big data allows more people to pay attention to these situations earlier. WeChat is the largest social media in China, and the number of monthly active accounts has reached to 1.165 billion. The WeChat Index is an official WeChat mobile index based on the analysis of WeChat big data. It reflects the popularity of words in the past 7 days, 30 days, and even 90 days. It is often used to capture current hot events and monitor the trends of public opinion. Here, through the keyword query in the WeChat index, we analyzed the public attention and demand for the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The popularity of the word \"mask\" began to increase on January 19, peaked on February 6 and 7, and has remained at a high level ever since. We suspect that the highest popularity of masks is due to the fact that most people cannot buy masks, so the online booking system for the purchase of masks has been opened in many places throughout the country. Relief supplies from various countries and medical materials purchased domestically are in place in large quantities, providing strong support to front-line medical staff. The words \"isolation\" and \"disinfection\" are almost inseparable, so their trends are very consistent. \"Vaccine\" reached a small peak on January 26th, February 12th, February 25th and March 18th, respectively, because both researchers have announced the start of vaccine development or clinical trials of vaccines.",

Then the public will begin to focus on the source of pathogens, the actions and self-protection of medical workers, as well as the needs of daily life. On the other hand, people will pay more attention to the epidemic situation in other places and the local control results. Through analysis of public concerns, we review the development trend of COVID-19, which will set up an example for future outbreaks of epidemic diseases.
