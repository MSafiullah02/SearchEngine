A detailed physical map of this phage genome has been constructed and is being extensively studied at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the expression of two late proteins of bacteriophage MB78 derived from the same gene as a result of possible ribosomal frameshifting. In vitro transcription-translation yields a major protein that migrates as 28 kDa, whereas in vivo expression using pET expression vectors yields two equally expressed proteins of molecular sizes 28 and 26 kDa. A putative slippery sequence TTTAAAG and a pseudoknot structure, two essential cis elements required for the classical ribosomal frameshifting, are identified in the reading frame. Mutations created at the slippery sequence resulted in a single 28 kDa protein and completely abolished the expression of 26 kDa protein. Thus, we have produced the first evidence that ribosomal frameshifting occurs in bacteriophage MB78 of Salmonella typhimurium.",

The ORF for the 28 and 26 kDa proteins starts from 1641 end of the EcoRI 'F' fragment resulted in complete abolition of 26 and 28 kDa proteins, but a major protein, and does not have a stop codon in the 'F' fragment; it appears that the vector stop codon, located adjacent to smaller in size (22 kDa, marked with triangle), was expressed ( lane 4). The deletion of 3\u221e end of the gene, EcoRI site, might be used. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of EcoRI 'F' fragment revealed that expression resulting in the synthesis of a single protein instead of two proteins, supports the frameshift notion. The pres-of 28 and 26 kDa proteins may have occurred through ribosomal frameshifting.
