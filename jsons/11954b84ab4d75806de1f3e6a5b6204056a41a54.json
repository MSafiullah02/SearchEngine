In the Akita mouse model of type 1 diabetes, insulin treatment normalized hyperglycemia, decreased urinary ACE2 excretion, restored renal ACE2 and ADAM17 expression to physiological levels, and normalized the rate of shedding (28) . A recent study has demonstrated a marked serum and pulmonary alterations in the ACE activity of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. In the lung of NOD mice, ACE activity was increased, and the ACE2/ACE activity ratio was decreased, as compared to control mice. Interestingly, insulin significantly increased ACE2/ACE activity ratio in the mice lung, and restored ACE and ACE2, and ACE2/ACE ratio activities in serum samples (29) . Therefore, it can be hypothesized that by restoring ACE2 expression to physiological levels on the cell surface and decreasing angiotensin II levels, insulin therapy might prevent the rapid propagation toward cytokine storm and lung injury in COVID-19.",

Of note, in type 2 diabetic mice, the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone normalized hyperglycemia, attenuated renal injury and decreased urinary ACE2 excretion and renal ADAM17 protein expression, but, unlike insulin, did not affect renal ACE2 expression (33) . On the other hand, pioglitazone upregulated ACE2 protein expression in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle in rats with high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (34) . An elevated ACE2 expression in insulin-sensitive tissues can attenuate the angiotensin II-induced insulin resistance. Pioglitazone effect on ACE2 expression in the lung is unknown. However, taking into consideration the risk of fluid retention, it is advisable to withhold PPAR-\u03b3 agonists in acutely ill patients. (39) . Interestingly, the GLP-1 agonist, liraglutide, provoked an increase in ACE2 expression in the lungs of both diabetic and control rats, and in the circulating angiotensin (1-7) in diabetic animals (40) . Based on these findings, it might be proposed that GLP-1 agonist therapy might exert protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 induced lung injury. 5) There is some emerging evidence suggesting anti-inflammatory effect of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) inhibitors (41) . However, recently published treatment recommendations advise to withhold these agents during COVID-19 illness due to the increased risk of dehydration and development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (42) .",

Insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury. Given the wide clinical spectrum of COVID-19 and the fact that patients needing hospital care may deteriorate rapidly, it is reasonable to consider the early introduction of insulin upon admission to the hospital. The suggested target glucose range is 140-180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) in most cases (47) . Although considerable evidence supports the use of incretin-based therapies in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia, more prospective studies comparing these agents with insulin are required to establish their efficacy and safety (48, 49) . Other antihyperglycemic agents lack safety data concerning their use in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Future studies should be carried out to elucidate the interface between diabetes and COVID-19 and unveil glycemic and extra-glycemic effects of glucose-lowering medications in this disease.",

Nevertheless, the available evidence does not support clinically meaningful alterations in immune response after administration of DPP4 inhibitors to human subjects (36). Previous study findings have shown that DPP4 serves as the functional receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (37). However, unlike MERS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 does not utilize DPP4 for cell entry, and DPP4 inhibition per se seems not to exert direct antiviral effects. A prospective phase IV clinical trial will assess the effect of DPP4 inhibitor, linagliptin, in glucose control and reducing the severity of the COVID-19 infection (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04341935) (38). 4) Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists attenuated LPS-induced lung injury in murine models",
