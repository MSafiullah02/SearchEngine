There has been a marked increase in travel among Hong Kong residents in the past decade. In 1996, Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents made over 37 million overseas visits (including mainland China), 56% more than in 1990, and 8% more than in 1995.7 This trend reflects rapid movement of large population subgroups, which may pose increased risks of travel-related illnesses, particularly communicable diseases. To describe the magnitude of the problem we reviewed the existing situation of travel-related health and the availability of travel medicine services in Hong Kong.",

Public hospitals do not provide any free immunizations to the public intending to travel to areas with vaccine-preventable diseases. Most people visit their general practitioners if they want travel health advice or pre-travel vaccinations. However, specialists also offer their expertise when appropriate through the referral service available to each setting. Below are a small number of services that are available in Hong Kong:",

First, the data were collected by a trained interviewer who may have used different interviewing techniques, despite having being instructed in a standard technique (interviewer bias). However, quality checks by the principal investigator found no discrepancies with the standard technique. Second, the data on non-respondents were not available to compare with respondents. It may be that those who participated in the study and completed the interview were those who are more concerned about health issues, were more knowledgeable and more likely to use protective measures while travelling. However, the 70% response rate was comparable to other local and international studies, indicating the reliability of the study findings. Third, the views gathered and health problems recorded were based on self-reporting of the physicians and survey respondents respectively (reporting bias). However, comparison with other available local and international data gave an estimate of the actual problem. Fourth, the data were collected in 1998 and may not reflect the current situation in 1995. Finally, the health burden associated with travel was estimated based on locally available information and health problems identified in the current study. In the absence of a comparison group it was difficult to assess the excess burden associated with travel. Moreover, some of the locally available studies5, 13, 21 were conducted among highly selected groups and, in addition, some of these studies mainly sought detailed information related to the risk of HIV infection. However, in the absence of any reliable data and the demand for an assessment within a limited period of time, our findings provided baseline information that could be used for further studies.",

While it may be difficult to identify those high-risk groups, the appropriate public health sector or the newly established Health Protection Agency could still take measures to reach the general public to meet their travel-related health care needs. Moreover, this assessment established the need for organized travel medicine services and training programmes in Hong Kong. This should encourage healthcare service providers and government policy makers to consider travel health service as part of the overall health care service and initiate programs accordingly.",
