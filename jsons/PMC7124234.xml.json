The other 3 were not NIOSH-approved respirators. All manufacturers claimed incorporating antimicrobial treatments in their respirators, but none of them were approved by any US regulatory agencies for their antimicrobial efficacy. One manufacturer embedded silver-copper based antimicrobial technology throughout the fiber on the outer layer of the mask. Similarly, EnvizO3-Shield technology (oxygen species) was incorporated on the outer layer of the mask by another manufacturer. In other cases, TiO2 coated filtering layers were placed beneath the outer layer of the mask or iodine-activated resin incorporated filtering layer was positioned within the respirator. The presence of antimicrobial agents on the straps and sealing surfaces is not known. NIOSH-approved FFRs, containing no known antimicrobial components, from a single manufacturer were used as the control.",

Compressed filtered air was passed into the nebulizer (20 psi, 10 L/min) to aerosolize MS2 along with the other constituents of the media. The proteins and other components of the aerosolization fluid serve as a protective factor, which has been shown to neutralize or serve a physical barrier to reduce the effectiveness of some antimicrobial agents.27 The aerosol was diluted with high-efficiency particulate air filtered air (13 psi, 50 L/min) downstream of the nebulizer outlet. The diluted aerosol entered the aerosol chamber and was allowed to equilibrate. After 5 minutes, MS2 aerosol was passed in parallel through 6 specimen holders, each containing a test coupon fixed in the sample port at 4 L/min flow rate (face velocity: 13.2 cm/seconds [s]) regulated by vacuum lines. MS2 droplet nuclei were allowed to deposit throughout the 6 respirator coupons for 30 minutes. Coupons from the controls and the antimicrobial respirator being tested were randomly assigned to a particular sample port (holder) to avoid any bias caused by port location within the Bio-Aerosol Respirator Test System chamber.",

MS2 virus reduction of the iodinated respirator coupon increased significantly at 37\u00b0C and 80% RH (4 hours, Fig 2) as did the control N95 respirator coupons, consistent with previous studies that showed MS2 inactivation was maximal at 75% RH and less at 20% and 30% RH.29, 30 However, coupons from antimicrobial respirator C were significantly different from the control N95 respirator coupons only for the tests done at 37\u00b0C and 80% RH, suggesting that the MS2 decontamination effect of the coupons from the iodinated respirator may be increased due to the high RH and high temperature employed in our study. Previous studies suggested that MS2 remained in the solid particle state at low RH, and inactivation of MS2 in the solid particle state was less compared with the levels in the fluid conditions.29, 30 This may be a reason why many types of viruses including influenza virus are maximally stable at a low RH environment.33, 34 High temperature and RH also increased MS2 log10 reduction compared with the low temperature and RH condition regardless of the respirator type. Taken together, the results suggest that iodine and high temperature and RH synergistically inactivated MS2 because this effect was not found for coupons from any of the antimicrobial respirators. Only coupons from antimicrobial respirator C showed a significant reduction of MS2 compared with the control coupons at 37\u00b0C and 80% RH. The results are in agreement with a previous study that investigated the decontamination efficacy of iodine-treated filter media against bacterial spores.18 Furthermore, comparing the results for respirator C to the controls for both storage conditions lends support to inactivation occurring on the respirator filter sample as opposed to in the extraction medium. This conclusion is further supported by the results from the toxicity assay showing that iodine released into the recovery medium was not directly interfering with the survival of MS2. This indicates that MS2 inactivation had occurred prior to the recovery of virus from coupons. However, one recent study reported that MS2 inactivation can occur in the extraction medium after removal of the virus from an iodine-coated filter.23 Further studies in this area are needed. Iodine inactivation of microorganisms appears to involve different mechanisms. In one study, iodine inactivation of poliovirus was mediated by disruption of the capsid protein coat.35 Results from a recent study employing isoelectric focusing of iodinated MS2 proteins suggested that iodine inactivation involved conformational changes to the protein coat.36 Some studies showed that iodine reaction with sulfhydryl groups caused inactivation of enzymes.37 Iodine also appears to cause nucleic acids damage in bacterial species previously.38\n",

Coupons from this antimicrobial respirator showed no ability to render MS2 inactive more than the control at either storage condition. However, bacterial culture on Petri dish coated with TiO2 when exposed to a UV-A light showed a significant increase in inactivation compared with the controls.39, 40 This may be partly explained by the difference in the intensity of the UV-A on the target organism and other exposure conditions. In our study, access for UV-A light to the TiO2 layer as well as free radicals to MS2 deposited in different layers26 are limiting factors unlike the direct UV-A exposure to bacterial cultures in other studies.39, 40 Alternately, the hydroxyl and oxygen radicals produced in the experimental setup were not sufficient enough to inactivate MS2. On the other hand, MS2 was shown to be highly sensitive to direct UV-C light (254 nm) compared with other virus types.41, 42 This may be attributed to the difference in the wavelengths of the UV light used in those experiments. It is well-known that free radicals damage cells through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and damage of DNA40 as well as RNA.43 The absence of a significant inactivation of MS2 by UV-A and TiO2 obtained in our study suggests the production of insufficient levels of free radicals to cause significant RNA damage.",

Other studies on antimicrobial surgical masks coated with a mixture of silver nitrate and titanium dioxide nanoparticles17 and silver particle coated activated carbon fibers24 demonstrated good antimicrobial properties against E coli and other bacteria, with complete inactivation occurring after 24 hours and 10 minutes of storage, respectively. In a previous report, MS2 virus resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline showed a slight (0.28 log10) reduction upon exposure to silver (0.1 mg/L) for 130 minutes.45 Silver also enhanced the effect of UV light-induced inactivation in a synergistic manner. Silver ion generated reactive oxygen species was found to inactivate microorganisms.46 Similarly, silver nitrate inactivation of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 at concentrations 30 \u03bcmol/L was reported.47 Another mechanism of heavy metals including silver is believed to be mediated by their ability to bind sulfhydryl groups of capsid proteins of viruses.47 In this study, coupons from the respirator containing silver-copper based antimicrobial technology failed to show a statistically significant decontamination of MS2 compared with the controls. This may be partly explained by the difference in the test methodologies. In our study, MS2 was resuspended in 1% ATCC medium 271 for aerosolization and then in 100% medium 271 for subsequent procedures. The aerosol particles undergo desiccation to become droplet nuclei. The protein contained in the aerosol medium is concentrated through a reduction in volume of the aerosolized particles.27 The high concentration of protein in the droplet nuclei can diminish the decontamination effect of silver-copper based antimicrobial technology on MS2 by competing/interfering with potential binding to sites including the capsid protein sulfhydryl groups of the virus. High concentration of many proteins is also known to inhibit the effect of antimicrobial agents including bleach27 and other agents.30\n",

In this study, a viral challenge was loaded by passing MS2 containing droplet nuclei with a mass median diameter of 141 nm through the respirator coupons. Under the conditions used in this study and a previous study, varying levels of MS2 virus may be deposited in different layers of the respirator.27 However, significant amounts of virus containing droplet nuclei remain on the surface for cross contamination. MS2 virus loaded as droplet nuclei were found to survive for an extended period of time (>20 hours)\u2014even for the antimicrobial respirators\u2014at room temperature and low RH, consistent with other studies investigating the survivability of viruses on other porous substrates.5 In practice, other studies have shown that MS2 can readily transfer from respirator to hand.11 Because viruses can generally survive for extended periods of time and the time between respirator donning/doffing events can be short, the antimicrobial agent needs to be able to reduce viability within hours and preferably within minutes. If an effective antimicrobial respirator could be developed and validated, it may be possible to reduce the risks of handling of contaminated respirators because the likelihood of transferring active virus particles to the hand would be greatly diminished.",

The antimicrobial respirators tested in the study were all previously evaluated by their respective manufacturers using different microorganisms and test protocols. MS2 virus selected for this study is a nonenveloped virus resistant to many antimicrobial agents. Thus, it is not surprising that only 1 antimicrobial respirator was somewhat effective at reducing MS2 viability at 1 storage condition. The decontamination efficacy of antimicrobial respirators is likely to be different for enveloped viruses such as influenza, which are more likely to be rendered inactive by many antimicrobial agents. In this study, MS2 resuspended in 1% ATCC medium 271 was aerosolized and loaded onto coupons. Different results could be obtained using a medium containing different concentration of proteins, leading to higher or lower levels of protective factor. In this study, respirator coupons with MS2 were stored at only 2 different storage conditions. The antimicrobial effect of respirator coupons at additional storage conditions may be necessary to confirm the results.",

Coupons from all 4 antimicrobial respirators showed <1-log reduction of MS2 at 22\u00b0C and 30% RH storage condition up to 20 hours, which was not significantly different from the N95 control FFR coupons. At 37\u00b0C and 80% RH, the iodinated antimicrobial respirator coupons showed 3.7-log10 reduction of MS2 at 4 hours, which was significantly higher than the control. The viability of MS2 from the coupons from the other antimicrobial respirators was not significantly different from the controls. In general, high temperature and RH decreased MS2 log10 survivability of control and antimicrobial respirators. The decontamination effect seen with the coupons excised from the iodinated respirators suggests that iodine and high temperature and RH synergistically inactivated MS2. The results suggest that the ability for antimicrobial respirators to reduce the amount of viable MS2 is dependent on the storage conditions and the antimicrobial agent used. Further improvements in antimicrobial respirators are necessary to assure that they reduce the risks of handling after contamination.",
