Studies have investigated the course of disease and immune response both in immunocompetent mice and animals deficient in specific components of the immune response. These studies have provided detailed knowledge of the role of each arm of the immune response in control of virus replication and spread, virus clearance, and in immunopathology. In all infections, outcome of infection is dependent on the age and genetic background of the mouse and the strain of the virus used. For simplicity, we will focus on the most commonly studied strains of each virus family and infection of mature mice. Detailed studies of immune responses to neurotropic viruses have included neuronal infections with rabies virus, flaviviruses, and alphaviruses, as well as infection of multiple cell types with natural mouse pathogens such as Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).",

Because of the interdependent relationships of components of the immune system in the development of an immune response, deficiencies of one type of cell or molecule may affect several facets of the immune response, making it difficult to identify specific effectors that are crucial for in vivo clearance.",

In addition to the physical protection by the BBB, the brain parenchyma has no lymphatic vessels or professional antigen-presenting cells, low expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and active maintenance of an immunologically quiescent state. However, the exclusion of immune cells and the role of active immune signaling in the CNS has been redefined recently (Schwartz et al., 2013; Muldoon et al., 2013; Elmer and McAllister, 2012; Hernang\u00f3mez et al., 2012). Resident cells in the nervous system, including neurons, play an active role in the immune response (Schultz et al., 2014; O'Donnell et al., 2012; Chakraborty et al., 2010; Daffis et al., 2008a; Castorena et al., 2008; Daffis et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2006). Additionally, memory T cell and B cell are found in the CNS long after infectious virus has been eliminated (Phares et al., 2013; Metcalf et al., 2013; Wakim et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2010).",

Local production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and IL-10 by astrocytes, pericytes, and meningeal cells further inhibits cellular activation (Schwartz et al., 2013; Fabry et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 1992).

Moreover, pretreatment with IFN is protective (Frolov et al., 2012; Lucas et al., 2003; Grieder and Vogel, 1999; Despr\u00e9s et al., 1995a).

Although IFN signaling stimulates the expression of hundreds of ISGs, antiviral effects of these proteins are both virus specific and tissue specific (Cho et al., 2013a; Diamond and Gale, 2012; Schoggins et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011).

The inflammasome activates caspase-1 to cleave precursors of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 helps to orchestrate the inflammatory response to infection. The magnitude and timing of the inflammatory response must be controlled to limit damage to bystander cells. Inflammasome-mediated signaling has varying affects during CNS infections (Prow and Irani, 2008; Sergerie et al., 2007; Liang et al., 1999). Inflammasome activation during WNV infection is protective, as mice deficient in inflammasome components have increased virus replication in the brain and decreased survival (Kumar et al., 2013; Ramos et al., 2012). In contrast, inflammasome activation in microglia and astrocytes contributes to increased immunopathology and possibly bystander neuronal death during Japanese encephalitis virus infection (Kaushik et al., 2012; Das et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In addition to controlling virus replication in CNS cells, innate immune signaling initiates the virus-specific adaptive immune response. Infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells into the CNS typically begins 3\u20134 days after infection (Figure 2(b) and 2(c)). T cell and B cell trafficking into the CNS is promoted by neuronal expression of the chemokine CXCL10 that binds to CXCR3 on activated T cell and B cell (Phares et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2005). Additionally, proper trafficking of T cells to appropriate brain regions is promoted by signaling through CCR5 and CXCR4 (McCandless et al., 2008). Cells first accumulate in the perivascular areas and then infiltrate the parenchyma in the regions of virus infection. Essentially, all components of the cellular immune response are detected in the infiltrate: natural killer (NK) cells, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes/macrophages (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2000; Rowell and Griffin, 1999; Parra et al., 1997; Pearce et al., 1994; Wesselingh et al., 1994). The uninfected CNS does not have professional antigen-presenting cells capable of activating na\u00efve T cells, but dendritic cells are detected in the CNS during inflammation after either entering from the circulation or developing from a subpopulation of activated microglia. Presentation of viral peptide antigen in association with the appropriate MHC molecules, predominantly expressed on glial cells, retains activated T cells in the CNS (Kimura and Griffin, 2000; Irani and Griffin, 1996; Suzumura et al., 1988). The continued presence of viral protein antigens promotes long-term retention of virus-specific B cells (Phares et al., 2013; Metcalf et al., 2013).",

This process has been studied both in virus-infected mice and in cultured neurons. In mice, the clearance of SINV is a two-phase process (Metcalf and Griffin, 2011). Infectious virus is rapidly cleared during the first week after infection and then viral RNA is cleared slowly over the next 30\u201360 days followed by persistence of a low level of RNA. CD8+ T cells followed by CD4+ T cells and B cells enter the CNS during the first phase when infectious virus is cleared. In the second phase, T cell and B cell are retained in the CNS during viral RNA clearance with overall larger numbers of CD4+ T cells and B cells than CD8+ T cells. Numbers of immune cells in the CNS gradually decrease with decreasing RNA, but the resident populations are steadily enriched in those that are virus specific. Within 2 months after SINV infection, most antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) produce SINV-specific IgG (Metcalf and Griffin, 2011; Tyor et al., 1992).",

In addition to neutralizing free virus, antibody to the SINV E2 glycoprotein can bind to the surface of infected cells and may direct intracellular signaling to control virus replication (Despr\u00e9s et al., 1995b; Levine and Griffin, 1992). The antiviral effect of this antibody does not require complement or phagocytic cells, but is dependent on bivalent antibody, implying that cross-linking of viral proteins at the cell surface results in intracellular inhibition of virus production (Ubol et al., 1995; Levine et al., 1991). Antibody acts by unknown mechanisms to suppress virus replication and restore host protein synthesis, membrane potential, and type-I IFN responsiveness (Despr\u00e9s et al., 1995a, Despr\u00e9s et al., 1995b).",

CD8+ T cells can be activated by interactions with MHC class I complexes on neurons (Chevalier et al., 2011) or through cross-priming interactions with MHC class I molecules on surrounding glial cells. T cells recruited into the CNS during SINV infection facilitate, but are not necessary, for RNA clearance (Rowell and Griffin, 2002; Kimura and Griffin, 2000).

Monocyte-derived cells likely signal to T cells, leading to optimal activation necessary for virus clearance (Durrant et al., 2013). T cells clear virus through IFN-\u03b3 production or through cytotoxic methods, such as perforin (Shrestha et al., 2006). Cytotoxic T cells are targeted to infected neurons upon upregulation of prodeath molecules (Fas or TRAIL ligand) and increased MHC class I expression (Shrestha et al., 2012; Chevalier et al., 2011; Shrestha and Diamond, 2007). Neurons infected with virulent strains of rabies virus upregulate FasL and B7-H1 to inhibit T cell function and prevent virus clearance and the virus-induced inflammatory response (Lafon et al., 2008; Baloul et al., 2004). Additional upregulation of the nonclassical MHC class I molecule HLA-G on infected neurons may promote tolerance (Lafon et al., 2005).",

In resistant strains of mice, virus clearance is dependent on a rapid CD8+ T cell response (Lindsley and Rodriguez, 1989). In susceptible strains, infectious virus is cleared from the neurons, but not from microglia, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Establishment of a persistent infection involves failure of all stages of the immune response, beginning with innate immune signaling through TLR3 and TLR2, proinflammatory molecule expression (IL-6), and regulation of infiltrating T cells (Jin et al., 2010; So and Kim, 2009). IL-6 inhibits cytotoxic T cell function and apoptotic death by preferential induction of IL-17-producing Th17 cells (Hou et al., 2009). Additionally, IL-17 and IL-6 synergistically promote expression of prosurvival Bcl family members that facilitate survival of virus-infected cells (Hou et al., 2014).",

            "text": "MHV infects a wide range of cell types including macrophages, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The early adaptive response to MHV infection is characterized by expression of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 and their receptors CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR3 by microglia and astrocytes (Lane et al., 1998). CXCL10 expression is important for recruitment of T cells (Phares et al., 2013). Proinflammatory cytokine expression (i.e., IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b2) decreases as the percentage of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and expression of T cell support molecules (i.e., CXCL10, CCL5, and IFN-\u03b3) increases (Lane et al., 1998; Parra et al., 1997). IFN-\u03b3 plays a key role in dampening MHV replication and orchestrating T cell infiltration, along with maximal expression of MHC molecules on microglia and macrophages (Whitman et al., 2009; Bergmann et al., 2003, Bergmann et al., 2004; Parra et al., 1997). Infiltrating CD4+ T cells accumulate around blood vessels and provide supporting factors for infiltrating CD8+ T cells that invade the parenchyma at the site of infection (Phares et al., 2011; Stohlman et al., 1998). Granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cells target MHC class I\u2013positive, infected cells for cytolysis, but effector function may be specific for the targeted cell type (Ramakrishna et al., 2004; Lin et al., 1997). IFN-\u03b3 is particularly important for clearance from oligodendrocytes, whereas perforin and CD8+ T cell\u2013mediated cytolysis is important for the clearance of virus from astrocytes and microglia (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005; Bergmann et al., 2003; Parra et al., 1999; Lin et al., 1997; Stohlman et al., 1995). Oligodendrocyte killing by CD8+ T cells results in demyelination during the acute phase of infection (Templeton and Perlman, 2008). Cytolytic function declines concomitant with loss of viral antigen (Ramakrishna et al., 2004; Lin et al., 1999). Viral RNA persists within the CNS for over 12 months, regardless of the presence of nonanergic, virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells retained in the CNS (Phares et al., 2010, Phares et al., 2011; Ramakrishna et al., 2004; Bergmann et al., 1999). Additionally, persistent oligodendrocyte infection and the consequent immune response are associated with chronic demyelination.",

Although control of the acute phase of MHV infection by the adaptive response is independent of antibody, long-term production of antibody is necessary to prevent reactivation of infection (Ramakrishna et al., 2002; Lin et al., 1999). As the BBB does not allow antibody to efficiently enter the CNS from the periphery, ASCs must either be continuously recruited to the CNS or maintained in the brain parenchyma to produce antibody locally (Metcalf et al., 2013; Stewart et al., 2011; Hooper et al., 2009; Diamond, 2003; Diamond et al., 2003; Ramakrishna et al., 2002; Tyor et al., 1992; Levine and Griffin, 1992; Parsons, 1989). Antibody controls persistent infection in the CNS through a multifaceted defense strategy that preserves neuronal function following infection. The need for continued antibody production in the CNS is highlighted in studies where passive transfer of antibody blocked recrudescence only during the time of treatment (Ramakrishna et al., 2002; Levine and Griffin, 1992; Levine et al., 1991).",
