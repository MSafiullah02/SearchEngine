            "text": "The genome replication of all plus-strand RNA viruses infecting eukaryotic cells is associated with cellular membranes. The membranes can be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or other organelles of the secretory pathway, mitochondria, chloroplasts, or from the endo-lysosomal compartment. The membrane association provides a structural framework for replication, it fixes the RNA replication process to a spatially confined place, increasing the local concentration of necessary components, and it offers protection for the alien RNA molecules against host defense mechanisms. The theme of immobilized polymerase and moving template may in fact be common also to most cellular DNA replication and transcription systems (Cook 1999) and might therefore reflect a primordial pathway in nucleic acid replication. The modes of membrane binding and targeting to specific intracellular organelles of the replication complexes of different viruses are so far poorly understood. However, this field at the interface of virology, cell biology, and biochemistry is attracting increased interest, as it represents an ancient feature shared by many virus groups. Some aspects have been nicely treated in earlier reviews (de Graaff and Jaspars 1994; Buck 1996) . We will present in some detail relevant studies on alphaviruses, especially Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which has been the object of our own interest. We will then review recent work on other viruses based on their classification in three superfamilies (Koonin and Dolja 1993) , except that we have treated nidoviruses as a separate group.",

Simple fractionation of membranes derived from the postnuclear supernatant fraction of alphavirus-infected cells showed that essentially all RNA polymerase activity was associated with a \"mitochondrial\" pellet fraction sedimenting at 15,000 x g. On the other hand, early electron microscopic (EM) studies had revealed cytoplasmic structures typical for alphavirus-infected cells. These were designated as \"cytopathic vacuoles type I\" (CPV-I), hereafter referred as CPVs. Their size varied from 600 nm to 2,000 nm, and their surface consisted of small vesicular invaginations or spherules, of homogenous size, with a diameter of about 50 nm. EM autoradiography of SFV-infected cells pulse-labeled with tritiated uridine already suggested that CPVs, and possibly the spherules, were involved in virus-specific, actinomycin D-resistant RNA synthesis (Grimley et al. 1968 ).",

(1988) demonstrated that they were modified endosomes and lysosomes. Immunofluorescence and immuno-EM techniques showed that Sindbis virus-specific nonstructural proteins nsP3 and nsP4 were associated with CPVs. The authors proposed that CPVs were derived from endosomes, which were participating in the internalization of virus particles. This would have nicely explained the endosomal origin of CPVs as a direct consequence of fusion of the virus envelope with the endo/lysosomal membrane, which would bring the virus nucleocapsid and genome directly to the cytoplasmic surface of the organelle. Thus genome uncoating and subsequent synthesis of replicase components would result in the modification of endosomes to virus-specific CPVs. However, this hypothesis cannot explain why the amount of CPVs was not dependent on the amount of infecting virions. Moreover, typical CPVs were seen also in cells transfected with the genomic RNA of SFV, demonstrating that the endosomal targeting of the replication complexes must be a posttranslational event (Per\u00e4nen and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen 1991) .",

Genetic and biochemical experiments have revealed many of the functions of the nsPs (reviewed in Strauss and Strauss 1994; K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen and Ahola 2002) . Thus nsP4 is the catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit, nsP2 is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of the subgenomic 26S mRNA coding for structural proteins of the virion, whereas nsP1 is needed in the synthesis of the complementary (minus strand) RNA early in infection. nsP3 is essential for infection, but no specific function has been assigned for it as yet. Expression of the individual nsPs in E. coli and in insect cells revealed further functions of nsPs. nsP1 is an RNA capping enzyme with unique methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities (Mi and Stollar 1991; Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen 1995) , whereas nsP2 turned out to be a NTPase and RNA helicase (Gomez de Cedr\u00f3n at Fig. 1 .

Pairwise double staining with different anti-nsP antibodies revealed costaining of CPVlike structures in immunofluorescence microscopy, suggesting that all four nsPs were associated with CPVs. This was confirmed by double-labeling in cryo-immuno EM (Kujala et al. 2001) . Moreover, bromouridine given in short pulses also localized to CPVs and spherules together with the nsPs, indicating that these structures were the sites of RNA replication. The CPVs costained with late endosomal (lamp-1, lamp-2, and rab7) and lysosomal markers (LBPA and LysoTracker). Interestingly, all nsPs had localization sites also outside of the CPVs. nsP2 was found in the nucleus, nsP1 at the plasma membrane, nsP3 in cytoplasmic spotlike structures, and nsP4 diffusely in the cytoplasm (Kujala et al. 2001) .

When these residues were mutated to alanines, nsP1 was still membrane associated, but less tightly, as it could now be released by high-salt treatment. Thus elimination of palmitoylation altered nsP1 from an \"integral\" to a \"peripheral\" membrane protein (Laakkonen et al. 1996) .",

Infectious virus was released to the medium, indicating that palmitoylation of nsP1 was not essential for virus replication. However, there was some retardation in the kinetics of virus growth. Analysis of the membrane association of wild-type and palmitoylation-negative mutant (1pa) replicase proteins of SFV showed that 1pa nsP1 was bound less tightly to the membranes than the wild-type protein. Typical CPVs with spherules, indistinguishable from those in wild-type SFV-infected cells, were seen in EM. The same results were obtained when the single palmitoylated cysteine residue (C420) of Sindbis virus nsP1 was mutated to alanine. However, the SFV 1pa mutant was apathogenic for mouse. After intraperitoneal infection blood viremia was detected, but no infectious virus was found in the brain (Ahola et al. 2000) .",

Tryptophan emission spectrum changes when it is embedded into an apolar environment. There was a marked increase in the fluorescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission in the presence of monolamellar liposomes, which consisted of PC and negatively charged phospholipids (PS, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid) (Fig. 2B ). By using phospholipids with bromide substitution in different carbon atoms of the acyl chain, for quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence, it was possible to estimate that W259 penetrated to the level of carbon atoms 9 and 10 of the PC acyl chains in the outer leaflet of the liposomes (Figs. 2C and 3A). The circular dichroism spectrum of the binding peptide was dependent on the content of the apolar constituents (liposomes or trifluoroethanol). In a buffer solution the binding peptide was mostly in a random coil, whereas in the presence of liposomes with 20%-30% PS or in 30%-50% trifluoroethanol the peptide attained an a-helical conformation (Fig. 2D ). The solution structure of the binding peptide, determined by NMR spectroscopy in 30% trifluoroethanol, revealed an amphipathic a-helix (Fig. 3A) . One face consisted of hydrophobic residues, leucines 248, 255, 256, and 261, valine 264, and residues S252 and W259 interacting with the apolar fatty acid chains on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane (Fig. 3) . The other face contained positively charged residues R253, K254, and R257 lying parallel to the polar head groups of the bilayer surface. The hydrophobic surface of the peptide is rather stable, whereas the polar residues show considerable mobility in trifluoroethanol.",

When P12 CA was expressed in HeLa cells, it was localized exclusively at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and in long filopodia-like extensions (Fig. 4A ), indistinguishable from those previously described for cells expressing nsP1 alone (Laakkonen et al. 1998 ). This indicated that the affinity to plasma membrane of nsP1 in the polyprotein overruled the attraction of nsP2 for nuclear transport. However, an interesting change in the localization was seen when P12 CA 3 was expressed (Fig. 4B ). No filopodia-like extensions were seen, and instead intracellular vesicular staining was observed, which in immuno-EM resembled CPVs ( Fig. 4C and D). Double immunofluorescence with antisera against nsPs and lamp-2 suggested that at least a fraction of the vesicular structures were late endosomes or lysosomes (Salonen et al. 2003) . Thus it seems that endosomal targeting is a joint action of nsP1 and nsP3 domains in the nonstructural polyprotein. The polyprotein is attached to the membrane first by the nsP1 binding peptide, which adopts a-helical structure. Concomitantly the nsP1 domain undergoes a conformational change, which activates the methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase. Palmitoylation of cysteine residues 418-420 thereafter anchors the protein irreversibly to the membrane. We propose that the targeting of nsP1 and polyproteins with this domain to the plasma membrane may simply be dictated by the optimal PS concentration in its cytoplasmic leaflet.",

The further processing of P123 is regulated by the slow in cis cleavage of the nsP1/2 site, which is essential for the next cleavage at the P2/3 site (Vasilieva et al. 2003) . Thus the polyprotein has time to fold properly and bind to membranes by the aid of the nsP1 domain. The proper folding of the complex enables protein-protein interactions, which cannot be achieved when the components are expressed individually (Salonen et al. 2003) . The polyprotein has a half-life of about 15 min before it is processed into the final components. During this time a replication complex synthesizes possibly only one minus-strand RNA before it is transformed into a stable plus-strand polymerase, which operates as the unit of replication within the spherule (Kujala et al. 2001 ).",

For BMV ( Fig. 5A ; Table 1 ), the targeting determinant of the replication complex has been mapped to the 1a protein, and more precisely to its N-terminal domain, part of which is distantly related to alphavirus nsP1. 1a is peripherally but tightly bound to membranes and exposed to the cytoplasm. Relatively large regions of 1a are needed for membrane association and ER targeting, but the exact molecular basis for membrane binding is not yet known (den Boon et al. 2001 ). Further comparative studies are needed to determine whether replicase proteins in the alphavirus-like superfamily share similar mechanisms of membrane association and targeting, but in the case of several viruses the capping enzyme domain binds to membranes (Magden et al. 2001) . Interestingly, TMV replication in A. thaliana specifically and absolutely requires host genes TOM1 or TOM3. They encode related multipass transmembrane proteins, which seem to interact with the TMV replicase and are speculated to participate in its membrane anchoring (Yamanaka et al. 2002) .",

The spherules produced by BMV in yeast cells have recently been characterized in exquisite detail (Schwartz et al. 2002) . BMV 1a protein alone, in the absence of other viral components, can induce spherule formation. When viral RNA is coexpressed with 1a, it is apparently protected inside the spherule in a membrane-associated, nucleaseresistant state. When the viral polymerase protein 2a is coexpressed, it associates with the spherules through interaction with 1a, and viral minus-and plus-sense RNA synthesis takes place in close association with the spherules, possibly in their interior, from where plus-sense RNA is released to the cytoplasm. Calculations based on immunolabeling suggest that many (maximally a few hundred) 1a proteins may be present in a spherule; leading to a hypothesis that 1a may form a shell-like structure coating the inside of the spherule (Schwartz et al. 2002) . BMV replication in yeast requires a certain concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, as demonstrated through a mutation in the host fatty acid desaturase gene and its complementation by addition of unsaturated fatty acids. Under restrictive conditions, 1a can still normally recruit viral RNA and 2a to membranes, but minus-strand synthesis is strongly inhibited. Unsaturated fatty acids, present in membrane lipids, generally increase membrane fluidity and plasticity. Therefore, proper assembly or function of the BMV replication complex seems to require a relatively fluid membrane (Lee et al. 2001 ).",

Nonstructural protein P2 yields protease 2A pro and 2BC, which in turn is cleaved to 2B and the NTPase 2C. P3 yields 3AB and 3CD pro , which are processed to 3A and 3B (=VPg) and to 3C and 3D pol , respectively (Fig. 5B) . VPg, a terminal protein of 22 aa, is linked to the 5 0 end of the genome.

The importance of ER as the primary source for poliovirus replication complexes was confirmed recently by experiments in which COPII coat components were shown to colocalize with poliovirus nonstructural proteins on budding vesicles upon their exit from ER. Resident ER proteins were excluded from the released vesicles, which were not destined to the Golgi complex, but accumulated in the cytoplasm (Rust et al. 2001 ). These results are in conformity with previous findings, which showed that poliovirus infection inhibits the transport of secretory and plasma membrane proteins (Doedens and Kirkegaard 1995) . Thus it seems that in poliovirus-infected cells a continuous proliferation and loss of ER membranes takes place. This process does not supply the Golgi complex with its normal lipids. The sensitivity of poliovirus replication to lipid synthesis inhibitors such as cerulenin could be explained by this scenario (Racaniello 2001; . Overexpression of viral or cellular ER-associated proteins also inhibits poliovirus replication, possibly by competing for the capacity of ER to generate new membrane material (Egger et al. 2000) .",

This must be first translated to yield the replicase proteins for its own replication in situ (Egger et al. 2000) . Assuming that the newly synthesized plus-strands create in turn new replication complexes by a similar in cis process, the \"rosette structures\" might well consist of closely packed assemblies of a parent replication complex and its numerous daughters, which are loosely bound to each other (Semler and Wimmer 2002) .",

As opposed to 2B, it does not prevent the transport of VSV G-protein to the plasma membrane (Suhy et al. 2000) . The fragment responsible for the membrane binding of 2C has been mapped to the N-terminal part of 2C within aa 18-54 . It has been predicted that this region has an amphipathic a-helix, which starts either from residue 10 (Paul et al. 1994) or 21 (Echeverri and Dasgupta 1995) . 2C has NTPase activity, which can be inhibited by guanidine, the well-known specific inhibitor of poliovirus replication . The ATPase activity of 2C is needed specifically in the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis, the only step inhibited by guanidine (Barton and Flanegan 1997) . Because 2C binds specifically to the 3 0 end of the minus-strand RNA, it may also have a function in the synthesis of the plus-strand RNAs, which takes place even in the presence of guanidine, that is, without ATPase activity. Anyhow, the tight membrane association of 2C and its intimate participation in minus-strand RNA synthesis mean that this process must also take place in association with membranes, although it has been difficult to prove . 2BC, like 2B, is a membrane protein, which interferes with the vesicular transport in both animal and yeast cells. Thus the 2B moiety in 2BC is responsible for the transport inhibition (Doedens and Kirkegaard 1995) . 2BC induces vesicles similar to those seen in poliovirus-infected cells and causes permeability increase of the plasma membrane, like 2B (Teterina et al. 1997) .",

In poliovirus-infected cells 3AB delivers the 22-aa-long VPg peptide to the 5 0 end of both minus-and plus-strand RNA molecules. Only membrane-associated 3AB can be cleaved by the viral proteases (3C pro and 3CD pro ), and thus serve as the source of VPg . 3AB associates tightly with cellular membranes, resembling the binding of integral membrane proteins.

Because of the extreme proliferation of the ER, the secretory apparatus becomes exhausted. The Golgi complex disappears, probably through retrograde transport that is not compensated by normal lipid flow from the ER. Development of poliovirus-induced vesicles must be associated with multiple fusion events directed either by viral or cellular proteins. Another possibility would be that the membrane proteins from the Golgi complex, and perhaps beyond it, would be enclosed to the poliovirus-specific vesicles through retrograde transport via ER. In any case, the result is that the membranes of the secretory and endocytotic apparatuses become mixed.",

Cowpea mosaic comovirus 32-kDa and 60-kDa replicase proteins are both targeted to subregions of the ER when individually expressed, and they also cause morphological alterations of the membrane system.

For tobacco etch potyvirus, the 6-kDa protein (analogous to poliovirus 3A) appears to be decisive in directing the replicase to the ER. The 6-kDa protein associates tightly with ER membranes by a single central hydrophobic domain (Schaad et al. 1997) .

Several phospholipid species can stimulate this reaction, for instance, phosphatidylcholine bearing acyl chains of 14-18 carbons. It has been speculated that glycerophospholipid might directly interact with a component of the crude membrane preparation, perhaps activating an enzymatic function, or alternatively, that the lipid might facilitate a membrane modification or assembly process required specifically for plus-strand synthesis (Wu et al. 1992) .

The monotopic binding of NS5A to membranes resembles the situation in alphaviruses, except that the binding peptide of NS5A is \"tip-anchored,\" rather than residing in the middle of the protein like in nsP1 ).

The majority of NS proteins, dsRNA, as well as nascent labeled viral RNA have been immunolocalized to VPs, which are derived from trans-Golgi membranes late in infection. VPs are \"vesicle sacs\" consisting of a cluster of individual vesicles (diameter about 50-100 nm) surrounded by a membrane. Interestingly, VPs were not detected on expression of Kunjin replicons, whereas CMs and PCs were formed. In these cells the dsRNA was scattered throughout the cytoplasm in small isolated foci, suggesting that all membrane structures induced by the replicase proteins are not necessarily sites of RNA replication (Mackenzie et al. 2001; Westaway et al. 1999) . Comparison between replicon cell lines producing RNA and NS proteins with different efficiencies suggests that the induction of virus-specific membranes is dose dependent and requires a certain level or concentration of viral products to manifest (Mackenzie et al. 2001) .",

The replicase proteins of equine arteritis virus (EAV) ( Fig. 5D ; Table 1 ), as well as newly synthesized RNA, accumulate in perinuclear granules and vesicles, which are of ER origin (van der Meer et al. 1998 ). An electron microscopic study of EAV-infected cells revealed DMVs of approximately 80-nm diameter, carrying the replication complex (Pedersen et al. 1999) . Usually the inner and outer membranes of the DMVs were tightly apposed but clearly separate. The mechanism for DMV formation appears to be a protrusion of paired ER-membranes, because DMVs having the outer membrane continuous with ER could be seen. These profiles sometimes contained a neck between the paired ER-membrane and a forming DMV, which had not yet pinched off. The formation of DMVs is not dependent on RNA synthesis, because DMVs strikingly resembling those seen in EAV-infected cells can be induced by heterologous expression of the nsp2-nsp3 region of the polyprotein ). On individual expression of these proteins, DMVs were not observed. The large nsp2 has a long central hydrophobic sequence, which may represent its membrane anchor, whereas nsp3 and nsp5 have several hydrophobic sequences, suggesting that they are polytopic membrane proteins. They all, and their precursors, also behave biochemically as integral membrane proteins (van der Meer et al. 1998) .",

Coronavirus-induced DMVs are larger than those induced by EAV, over 200 nm in diameter, and they are surrounded by tightly apposed membranes that have fused into a lipid trilayer. Viral RNA and replicase proteins are found on the surface of DMVs, where RNA synthesis also takes place. The coronavirus replicase proteins are membrane associated and include the integrally bound components p210 and p44, the coronavirus counterparts of EAV nsp2 and nsp3 . At the moment, the origin of the coronavirus replication complexes (DMVs) is not clear; involvement of membranes from secretory and endosomal compartments has been suggested. It should be noted that the majority of the viral replicase proteins may be located elsewhere than in the active replication complexes, as in SFV-infected cells (Kujala et al. 2001 Many viruses replicate on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. For instance, picornavirus nonstructural proteins are targeted to the ER through 2B, 2C, 3A, and their precursors, bromovirus replication complex by the 1a protein, and arterivirus replicase by the nsp2-nsp3 complex (Table 1) . However, the targeting mechanisms remain to be solved, as no specific receptors for viral components on the ER have been identified. Because all HCV and flavivirus proteins are translated from the same polyprotein as their envelope glycoproteins, it might be expected that their ns proteins also remain at the ER membrane. However, their location is guaranteed by their own independent affinity for ER membranes. In the case of Kunjin virus the NS1 glycoprotein, which is translocated to the cisternal side of the ER, may be responsible for the transport of the replication complex to the trans-Golgi region by transmembrane contact.",

FHV virus protein A is directed to the mitochondrial outer membrane by a specific targeting sequence. A similar mechanism seems to operate in the targeting of the tombusvirus replication complex to either mitochondria or chloroplasts, depending on the virus species. The RNA replication of alphaviruses on the membranes of the endosomal apparatus (plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes) might be explained by direct interaction of the amphipathic a-helix of nsP1 with these PS-rich membranes. It is an interesting question whether specific lipid components, or the lipid composition of the target membranes, might attract replicase components of other viruses as well.",

The amphipathic a-helix strategy has been proposed for components of picornavirus and for several plant virus replication complexes. Monotopic hydrophobic anchors have been proposed for poliovirus 3A and related plant virus proteins, and polytopic membrane anchors have been demonstrated for HCV proteins NS2 and NS4B.

It has been proposed that the internal surface of the spherules is covered by the replicase protein 1a of BMV (Schwartz et al. 2002) . As the spherules seem to be a general feature for the members of the alphavirus superfamily, it will be interesting to see whether the suggested protein coating of the inner surface of spherules is a general mechanism within the whole superfamily. Involvement of host cell proteins cannot be excluded, as membrane bending and vesiculation in cells is a complex process requiring several factors (Hurley and Wendland 2002) .",

The individual vesicles represent units of replication (Egger et al. 1996) . They have a tubular extension, which resembles the neck of a spherule through which the nascent RNA is proposed to be \"secreted\" from the site of synthesis (Froshauer et al. 1988 ). The DMVs (Fig. 6D ) seem to the sites of arterivirus and coronavirus RNA synthesis as well. Evidently the vesicles wrap the template RNA, which in the case of poliovirus, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses is probably double-stranded, shielding it from host nucleases. During virus infection, translation and assembly of virus particles take place in close association with the replication complexes, utilizing nascent RNAs immediately after their synthesis.",
