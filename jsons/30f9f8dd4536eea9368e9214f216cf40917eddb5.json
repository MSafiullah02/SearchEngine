            "text": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children aged 1-59 months worldwide [1] . WHO recommends providing low flow oxygen by nasal cannula in pediatric patients with oxygen saturation < 90% [2] . With the provision of oxygen supplementation, some children still require further respiratory support such as mechanical ventilation due to the failure to maintain oxygen saturation and severe respiratory distress [3, 4] . However, mechanical ventilation may result in ventilator-induced lung injury [5] . As a simple and minimally invasive technique, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been used in children with severe pneumonia [6, 7] , but its effect and safety are uncertain. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis that compared CPAP with standard therapy or low-flow oxygen to figure out the effects and safety of CPAP.",

We conducted subgroup analyses to investigate whether effects of CPAP on mortality and intubation differed according to different age. In the subgroup analysis, no significant differences regarding mortality were found between CPAP and control groups in different age groups (children age < Fig. S1b in supplement). We did not conduct subgroup analyses based on different settings, sample size, and highrisk conditions because of the limited number of studies. Note that sensitivity analysis by removing the crossover trail or the study without the supervision of physicians seperately did not change the result of mortality (see Fig. S2a, Fig.S2b in supplement). Data for change in RR were available from only one RCT [10] (n = 69).

HR was observed with no significant change in the same trial [10] ; nonetheless, the lack of original data prevented us from a meta-analysis. The pooled data from one RCT [11] (n = 146) suggested there was no significant reduction in the length of hospital stay in CPAP group (MD = 0.29, 95%CI \u2212 0.37, 0.96, P = 0.39) (Fig. 2b) .

One crossover trial [13] found no significant difference in mortality between groups, but the study population was relatively low-risk; few children had hypoxemia or were severely malnourished. Another RCT [11] that recruited children with severe pneumonia and hypoxemia showed significantly lower mortality in CPAP group, but the study was done in an intensive care unit, which means higher nurse-to-patient ratios and better medical supervision. Differently, the latest and largest RCT [12] which was done in the general ward without daily physician supervision showed an increase in mortality with the use of CPAP among high-risk (such as HIV, malnutrition, or hypoxemia) children with severe pneumonia. The differences mentioned above may contribute to the inconsistent results. Notably, WHO-defined severe pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis that does not require chest radiographs to confirm the presence of lower respiratory disease. The nonspecific signs and symptoms can be found in children without primary respiratory disorders such as circulatory failure [12, 14] , which may cause the recruited participants not to be wholly homogenous in different studies. Due to heterogeneity between the studies and the conflicting results, it is difficult to conclude the effect and safety of CPAP.",

There was no significant difference in intubation rate, length of hospital stay, and adverse events between the CPAP and control groups. In conclusion, data regarding safety is contradictory for the use of CPAP among children with severe pneumonia. Limited evidence suggests CPAP may reduce respiratory rate. Still, there is a lack of evidence to show significant benefit for the use of CPAP for other outcomes. More well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate which specific patient populations could benefit from CPAP in various settings.
