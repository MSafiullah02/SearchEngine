Although some rate-limiting steps of the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway are well known, the specific roles of gene family members in I. indigotica in regulating lariciresinol production are poorly understood. In the present study, a correlation analysis between the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) expression profile and lignan content by using I. indigotica hairy roots treated with methyl jamonate (0.5 \u03bcM) at different time points as a source implicated that I. indigotica pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase 1 (IiPLR1), but not IiPLR2 or IiPLR3, contributed greatly to lariciresinol accumulation. Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated that IiPLR1 indeed influenced lariciresinol biosynthesis, whereas suppression of IiPLR2 or IiPLR3 did not change lariciresinol abundance significantly. IiPLR1 was thus further characterized; IiPLR1 was constitutively expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of I. indigotica, with the highest expression in roots, and it responds to different stress treatments to various degrees. Recombinant IiPLR1 reduces both (\u00b1)-pinoresinol and (\u00b1)-lariciresinol efficiently, with comparative K cat /K m values. Furthermore, overexpression of IiPLR1 significantly enhanced lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica hairy roots, and the best line (ovx-2) produced 353.9 \u03bcg g -1 lariciresinol, which was ~6.3-fold more than the wild type. This study sheds light on how to increase desired metabolites effectively by more accurate or appropriate genetic engineering strategies, and also provides an effective approach for the large-scale commercial production of pharmaceutically valuable lariciresinol by using hairy root culture systems as bioreactors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Isatis indigotica Fort.

The existence of multicopy gene families in the metabolic pathway suggests divergent functional roles for pathway components involved in the biosynthesis of metabolites. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, six squalene epoxidases (SQEs) were predicted based on a homology search (SQE1-SQE6) (Benveniste, 2002; Rasbery et al., 2007; Pos\u00e9 et al., 2009) ; however, only the products of SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3 were able to functionally complement the Saccharomyces cerevisiae squalene epoxidase mutant erg1 (Rasbery et al., 2007) . Recently, only SQE3, but not SQE2, was found to functionally complement SQE1 in the promotion of plant squalene epoxidase activity (Laranjeira et al., 2015) . At the early stages of Arabidopsis seed development, embryo viability relies on farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or an FPP-derived isoprenoid/ sterol precursor provided by farnesyl diphosphate synthase 1 (FPS1) gene products, but not those of FPS2 (Keim et al., 2012) . In contrast, Arabidopsis HMG-CoA reductase 1 (HMGR1) and HMGR2 are both responsible for the biosynthesis of triterpenes (Ohyama et al., 2007) . Arabidopsis acetoacetyl CoA thiolase 1 (AACT1) and AACT2 can both complement the lethal aact deletion allele (DERG10) in yeast despite displaying different spatial and temporal expression patterns (Jin et al., 2012) . With respect to lariciresinol biosynthesis, although some enzymatic steps have been proposed to be particularly important for activating the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) (Humphreys and Chapple, 2002; Nakatsubo et al., 2008; Satake et al., 2013) , the specific roles of gene family members in regulating this metabolic flux have rarely been investigated. PLR, a gene encoding pinoresinol/ lariciresinol reductase, represents one of the most important rate-limiting steps of the lariciresinol biosynthetic pathway (Satake et al., 2013) . Hemmati et al. (2010) reported that both LuPLR1 and LuPLR2 are expressed in flax seed tissues, whereas only LuPLR2 is expressed in stem and leaf tissues. Zhao et al.

The RNA-Seq expression profile showed that almost all tested genes except IiDIR15 responded to MeJA treatment, indicating their important role in MeJA-mediated transcriptional reprogramming.

Since jasmonates orchestrate a diverse set of physiological and developmental processes in plants (Pauwels et al., 2008) , it is suggested that the various response patterns might be caused by several different regulatory mechanisms.

This knowledge-driven approach for engineering requires a well-characterized population as a source of genetic variation. The potency of jasmonates, such as MeJA, to elicit secondary metabolism in cell cultures has made them powerful tools to cause the genetic diversity and help to unravel the complex cellular process (Pauwels et al., 2008) . Combined transcript and metabolite profiling approaches to determine the MeJA-mediated regulation of secondary metabolism resulted in the establishment of gene-metabolite networks involved in the biosynthesis of the pharmaceutically valuable terpenoid indole alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus (Rischer et al., 2006) , in the characterization of enzymatic steps in the isoflavone biosynthetic pathways in Medicago truncatula (Naoumkina et al., 2007) , and in the rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathways in Salvia miltiorrhiza (Xiao et al., 2009) , as well as in the isolation of novel regulators of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Hirai et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 498, "end": 518, "text": "(Farr\u00e9 et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 841, "end": 863, "text": "(Pauwels et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1180, "text": "(Rischer et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1313, "text": "(Naoumkina et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1407, "text": "(Xiao et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1533, "text": "(Hirai et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Here, MeJA-elicited I. indigotica hairy roots were employed as a resource for the identification of candidate lignancorrelated genes. These hairy roots obtained from different time points after MeJA treatment harbour genetic diversity, impacting on the chemical composition of lignans, as shown in Fig. 2 . Correlation analysis of gene transcripts and metabolite contents resulted in multiple new hypotheses regarding regulatory relationships between the identified biosynthetic genes and lignans ( Fig. 3; Table 1 ). Seven biosynthetic genes were identified to be significantly correlated with lariciresinol, a pharmaceutically valuable compound of I. indigotica. To validate this network analysis, one of the best-supported nodes, IiPLR1 (predicted to be positively correlated with lariciresinol), together with its family members (IiPLR2 and IiPLR3, predicted to be uncorrelated with lariciresinol) were investigated. RNAi suppression of IiPLR1 significantly inhibited lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica hairy roots compared with the WT, whereas IiPLR2 or IiPLR3 suppression did not influence lariciresinol accumulation significantly. These results demonstrated that IiPLR1, but not IiPLR2 or IiPLR3, plays an important role in lariciresinol accumulation in I. indigotica, consistent with the hypothesized regulatory roles. IiPLR1 was thus further characterized. Its expression in roots is much higher than that in stems, leaves, and flowers, suggesting that IiPLR1 is mainly participating in the lariciresinol biosynthesis in roots.

It is thus speculated that as a key intervention point regulating lignan production, IiPLR1 expression should be significantly induced when subjected to environment stresses. In agreement with this, it was observed that IiPLR1 was inducible by MeJA, ABA, and UV-B, although the extent of the induction varied dramatically. IiPLR1 was highly induced by ABA like LuPLR1 from Linum usitatissimum, which was reported to play a key role in ABA-mediated regulation of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside biosynthesis in flax (Renouard et al., 2012; Corbin et al., 2013) . Compared with MeJA elicitor, ABA was shown to be more effective in up-regulating IiPLR1 (peaking at 12 h with a 14-fold increase), suggesting that ABA elicitation was a better potential strategy to enhance the accumulation of desired lignans of I. indigotica via the transcriptional regulation of the IiPLR1 gene. IiPLR1 responded to UV-B very rapidly, but the highest IiPLR1 transcript appeared at 30 min after UV-B was turned off. It is suggested that the plant defence and repair process in response to UV-B happened sequentially; thus IiPLR1 needed to be be highly expressed at different times, and the fact that the highest IiPLR1 transcript was found after UV-B was turned off was probably due to the repair rather than the protection mechanism (Di et al., 2012) .
