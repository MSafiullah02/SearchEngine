Although a significant progress has recently been made in understanding of Ebola virus biology and pathogenesis, development of effective anti-Ebola treatments has not been very productive, compared to other areas of antiviral research (e.g., HIV and HCV infections). No approved vaccine or medicine is available for Ebola but several are currently under development.

            "text": "The recent outbreak in West Africa, 7 which started in March 2014, represents the biggest Ebola outbreak so far and it is considered to be the first Ebola epidemic the world has ever seen. 6 It has brought a substantial attention of both scientific community and the public. Over 20,000 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD have been reported by WHO from six African countries (with main incidence in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) and several isolated cases also from other countries (Spain and United States). 8 The reported case fatality rate across the most-affected countries is estimated to be at least 70%. 9 VHFs caused by filoviruses are usually characterized by nonspecific flu-like symptoms including high fever, severe headache, myalgia, and prostration, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, and further signs as bleeding, petechiae, rash, dry cough, chest pain, behavioral disorders, and seizures, resulting in multiorgan failure and, ultimately, death. 10-12 Death, due to multiorgan failure and a syndrome resembling septic shock, typically occurs within 6-16 days after development of the clinical signs. 13, 14 Commonly applied standard supportive care is based on replacement of the body fluids patients lose during the infection, and on treatment of other opportunistic infections. Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat EHF. Although several small-molecule candidates were developed and approved for the treatment of various RNA virus infections, 15 most of them did not show to be really potent in case of filovirus diseases. Only a handful of potential antiviral agents are in the pipeline for filovirus infections, 16-23 but these experimental drugs actually represent promising options for the prevention and treatment of EVD.",

The use of vaccines is, furthermore, accompanied with more or less serious adverse effects and it is not even clear how efficient it would be in areas endemic with various other serious human diseases (e.g., malaria), where, moreover, the local community may strongly disagree with vaccination. Development and use of humanized monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ZMapp) 24 also has significant limitations, including stability, difficulty with transport, and problematic scale-up production. For these reasons, usage of small-molecule antivirals is invaluable approach in treatment and prevention of viral infections in general and development of potent small-molecule anti-EBOV agents is clearly of high priority.",

            "text": "Among nucleoside analogues, ribavirin (Virazole, Fig. 1 ), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, has received a lot of attention. 28 Ribavirin has been reported to be active against some hemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g., Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), but it had no in vitro or in vivo effects on Ebola and Marburg viruses. 29 Later, number of structural adenosine analogues, for example, 3-deazaaristeromycin (C-c 3 Ado, Fig. 1 ) and 3deazaneplanocin A (c 3 -Npc A, Fig. 1 ), were discovered to inhibit replication of EBOV in vitro by blocking S-adenosyl-L-homocystein (SAH) hydrolase. [30] [31] [32] SAH hydrolase is a key enzyme in methylation reactions depending on Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and it has a key role in the methylation of 5 -end guanine of viral messenger RNA (regulation of capping process). Since the discovery of SAH hydrolase as a valuable pharmacological target for antiviral chemotherapy, 33 a large variety of adenosine (Ado) analogues as potential SAH hydrolase inhibitors have been reported. [34] [35] [36] Such inhibitors block the cleavage of S-adenosyl-L-homocystein (SAH) into homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine, which itself can be further metabolized into AMP, adenine, and inosine. As a consequence of the SAH hydrolase inhibition, SAH accumulates in the cell and leads to an inhibition of the SAM-dependent methylation processes, including those that are required for the maturation (i.e., 5 -capping) of viral mRNAs. As a consequence, maturation of viral mRNAs is suppressed, and so is the production of progeny virus particles.",

In later study, 37 it was discovered that the protective effect of 3-deazaneplanocin A might result from massively increased production of interferon-\u03b1 in Ebola-infected, but not uninfected mice. SAH hydrolase inhibitors have received only limited clinical evaluation and should be further tested for their potential antifilovirus properties as they exert a broad-spectrum antiviral activity and represent an attractive antiviral strategy. 38 Ye and Schneller 39 have reported 1 ,6 -isoneplanocin A enantiomers (e.g., \"D-like\" 1 ,6isoneplanocin A, Fig. 1 ) as compounds potent against a variety of important viruses, including EBOV with submicromolar EC 50 values (e.g., EC 50 = 0.38 for the \"D-like\" enantiomer, Fig. 1 ). The author also speculated that SAH hydrolase inhibition is not the only site of action of the \"L-like\" enantiomer and more studies are needed to fully understand the antiviral potential of L-like carbocyclic nucleosides. 39 Rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFIs), 40 for example, compound dUY11 ( Fig. 1) , are uridine nucleoside analogues bearing a bulky hydrophobic group in the C-5 position. RAFIs represent another group of synthetic compounds that inhibit infectivity of several unrelated enveloped viruses, including HCV and HSV-1 and HSV-2 at submicromolar range and with no cytotoxic or cytostatic effects (selectivity index > 3000). 40 It was shown that RAFIs inhibit virion fusion as a result of their shape and amphipathicity. RAFIs should be further evaluated against other emerging viruses, such as EBOV and MARV.",

It is an adenine analogue of the so-called Immucillin H, 42 a powerful transition-state analogue 43 inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, which has a potential for treatment of human T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum activity against numerous viruses, including filo-, bunya-, arena-, paramyxo-, corona-, and flaviviruses. BCX4430 was shown to inhibit infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells and postexposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protected rodents both against EBOV and MARV viral disease. 41 It, moreover, completely protected cynomolgus macaques from MARV infection when administered as late as 48 hr following infection. BCX4430 appeared to inhibit viral RNA polymerase function, acting probably as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. 41 BCX4430 also effectively treated yellow fever virus (YFV) infection in a hamster model, even when treatment was initiated at the peak of viral replication. 44 The first-in-man Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of BCX4430 administered via intramuscular injection in healthy volunteers was announced by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (Durham, NC, USA) in the middle of December 2014. 45 Brincidofovir (CMX001, BCV, HDP-CDV, Fig. 1 ) is an oral nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against dsDNA viruses that effect humans, 46 including adenoviruses, 47, 48 poxviruses, 49 and herpesviruses. 50 CMX001 is a hexadecyloxypropyl prodrug of cidofovir ( Fig. 1) , 51 acyclic nucleoside phosphonate 52 approved by FAD for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. CMX001, being developed by Chimerix (Durham, NC, USA), has several key advantages compared to the parent compound: improved oral bioavailability, rapid transport across cell membranes leading to higher intracellular concentrations of the active species, greater potency, and elimination of nephrotoxicity. 53, 54 Brincidofovir has actually received Fast Track designation from the FDA for treatment of CMV, adenovirus, and smallpox infections.",

The IC 50 values of all the compounds against EBOV ranged from 10 to 52 \u03bcg/mL and the mechanism of action of these analogues remained speculative. 56 Favipiravir (T-705, Fig. 2 ), 57, 58 or 6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide, is a broadspectrum antiviral agent active against many RNA viruses, as alpha-, arena-, bunya-, flavi-, noro-, orthomyxo-, and picornaviruses. It was discovered and developed by Toyama Chemical Co. (Toyama, Japan) as anti-influenza virus agent, 59, 60 and is approved in Japan as an influenza treatment under the brand name Avigan. Favipiravir is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials in the United States. The in vivo efficacy of T-705 was recently confirmed in a mouse models for EBOV, when postexposure initiation of T-705 administration completely prevented the lethal consequences. 61, 62 In vitro, T-705 is efficiently converted by cellular enzymes to its ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate (T-705 RTP, Fig. 2 ), the active species that was suggested to selectively inhibit influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 60 T-705 RTP is recognized by influenza A virus polymerase as an efficient substrate for incorporation to the RNA both as a guanosine and an adenosine analogue and its two consecutive incorporations were shown to prevent further primer extension. 63 Baranovich et al. 64 have reported lethal mutagenesis to be the key antiviral mechanism of T-705, that also explains its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Favipiravir has been given to several Ebola patients and with its unique mechanism of action currently represents a very promising candidate for EVD treatment. r JANEBA",

It was effective against influenza A, filo-, pox-arena-, bunya-, paramyxo-, flaviviruses, and HIV, but had no effect on the infection of nonenveloped viruses. LJ001 intercalates into viral membranes preventing viruscell fusion, but the host cells can overcome the toxic effects of LJ001 due to their repair by cellular lipid biosynthesis. The rhodanine derivative LJ001 was suggested to inhibit viral entry at a step after virus binding and before virus-cell fusion, but the molecular target and molecular mechanism remained elusive. Later, Vigant et al. 68 identified the unsaturated fatty acid chains of viral membrane phospholipids as the major target of LJ001 antiviral activity. In the membrane bilayer, LJ001 generates singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and subsequent lipid oxidation results in changes to the biophysical properties of the viral membrane that disrupts the virus ability to undergo viruscell fusion. Furthermore, elucidation of the mode of action and subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) optimization of LJ001 led to a new class of oxazolidine-2,4-dithiones, for example, compound JL103 (Fig. 3) , 68 as membrane-targeted photosensitizers with increased potencies, 1 O 2 quantum yields, and red-shifted absorption spectra.",

Kinase, as well as phosphatase inhibitors may represent new leads and a unique strategy for antifilovirus therapeutic development and such compounds with reported anti-EBOV activity have recently been reviewed in depth. 21 Yermolina et al. 71 have reported a novel group of selective inhibitors of filoviral entry that selectively inhibit the EBOV and MARV GP mediated infection of human cells. Extensive SAR study led to an identification of lead compound 5 (Fig. 3) as a selective inhibitor of filoviral entry with an IC 50 of 30 \u03bcM. 71 Also several natural products that are able to impair microfilament function, including latrunculin A (Fig. 3) and cytochalasins, were shown to be potent inhibitors of EBOV virus GP mediated entry and fusion. 72 A novel high-throughput screening (HTS) assay of some 5000 small molecules led to an identification of novel broad-spectrum compounds able to block cathepsin L (CatL) cleavage of viral GPs derived from SARS-CoV and EBOV, Hendra, and Nipah viruses that are required for their entry into the host cell. 73 Parent compound 5705213 (Fig. 3 ) and its derivative 7402683 (Fig. 3) showed IC 50 s of 15 and 10 \u03bcM against EBOV-GP, respectively, and are not cytotoxic.

FGI-106 protected mice from otherwise lethal EBOV infection both in prophylactic and therapeutic settings. FGI-106 also revealed potential inhibitory activity against other viral pathogens including HIV and HCV, 86 but the precise mode of action remains unclear. 22 The broad-spectrum nature of the antiviral activity of DAAC-based analogues may suggest targeting of a conserved host pathway. 86 Conventional antivirals are designed to target virally encoded proteins/enzymes and mechanisms. The disadvantage of the conventional antivirals is often their toxicity to the host and development of the resistant viral strains rendering them relatively quickly ineffective. To prevent the resistance problem, combination therapies using a cocktail of drugs with various modes of actions were successfully introduced and approved. Host-directed therapeutics represents another important approach to combat established, as well as emerging viral diseases. 87 Such approach is based on targeting host to deny the viral pathogen the ability to cause disease.",

Some of the compounds were also shown to inhibit a replication-competent EBOV in a cell-based assay. 102 Recent HTS of a subset of FDA-approved drugs has reported that also antimalarials amodiaquine and chloroquine were active in vitro and in vivo against EBOV in single digit micromolar range, 76, 77 but the mechanism of action was unclear. Later it was shown 103 that these compounds docked favorably in VP35 suggesting they may be targeting this VP. Furthermore, chloroquine was shown to block EBOV virus like particle entry at an IC50 \u00df15 \u03bcM with selectivity index SI > 32. 77 Small-molecule screening for EBOV inhibitors leads to identification of NSC 62914 (Fig. 5) . 104 The compound acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and it upregulates oxidative stress induced genes. ROS contribute to the pathogenesis of a wide array of Budding of a broad range of RNA viruses is facilitated by subversion of host proteins (e.g., Nedd4) by viral PPxY late budding domains expressed within the matrix proteins of these viruses. In silico design and subsequent SAR study resulted in an identification of lead compounds 7 and 8 (Fig. 5 ) with ability to inhibit these critical viral-host (PPxY-Nedd4) interactions. 105 In addition, compounds 7 and 8 exhibited antibudding activity against EBOV and other RNA viruses and can thus serve as the lead structures for the development of novel broad-spectrum antivirals.",

PMOs also protected 75% of rhesus macaques in a prophylactic regimen. 113 Sarepta Therapeutics (Cambridge, MA, USA, formerly AVI BioPharma) has developed PMO containing up to five positively charged linkages (PMOplus, Fig. 6 ) 114, 115 that have significantly improved the stability, efficacy, specificity, delivery, and safety of antisense complexes. Chemical evolution of the antisense molecules led to the discovery of two new therapeutic agents, AVI-7537 targeting the VP24 transcript of EBOV and AVI-7288 targeting the NP transcript of MARV. 116 The VP24 protein is an inhibitor of type I interferon responses. It also forms homodimers and binds to VP35 or NP and, thus, may play an important role in the switch from viral replication to transcription, a function that is critical to the viral life cycle. Inhibition of VP24 may lead to an efficient host response to viral infection.",

The research programs should be facilitated by use of specific technologies and strategies, 123, 124 as well as high-throughput systems 125, 126 and suitable animal models, 127-130 that have been recently reported. Especially, the use of laboratory animals is fundamental for the development of potent antifiloviral agents. Since guinea pigs are, for their size, less useful, newborn mice and immunodeficient adult mice represent a suitable model for preliminary testing of potential vaccines and antiviral agents. 16 But namely use of non-human primates (NHPs), in which filoviruses cause severe VHF, is crucial for the successful development of efficient anti-EBOV treatments. 16 All of the filoviral proteins (GP, L, NP, VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40) 16, 131 can potentially be chosen as a suitable target for development of druggable anti-EBOV agents. For example, VP24 and VP35, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L have been shown so far to be exploitable targets for potential antiviral therapy. It has also been demonstrated that host-directed therapeutics, those targeting host proteins (e.g., TSG101, SAH hydrolase), represent another viable approach to combat various viral diseases. The number of small-molecule inhibitors was shown to interfere with the filoviral entry/fusion step, but mode of action of many other inhibitors of viral replications is not yet known or fully understood.",
