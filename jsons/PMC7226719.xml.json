They included medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism and patient care. Clinical instructors must teach and assess junior medial trainees in CC before they enter sub-specialties. In 2003, the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in this country exposed serious deficiencies of CC-based primary care by junior trainees due to a lack of appropriate education. Accordingly, there is an urgent educational need to train faculty to educate junior medical trainees in CC-based primary care. Faculty development (FD) refers to activities that clinical instructors or organization pursue to improve their knowledge, skills, and behaviors in response to specific educational needs [1, 2].",

In 2009, the DOH began to regularly fund \u201cFD programs\u201d in nationwide organizations to strengthen clinical instructors\u2019 skills for delivering CC education [5].

In general, clinical instructors had reported that our regular FD module familiarizes them with CC-based teaching and assessment and thus, increases their confidence [8, 9].",

First, it did not assess outcomes at level 4 of the Kirkpatrick Model such as whether the intervention FD module improved clinical education or decreased medical errors [14, 15, 36\u201339]. Therefore, it will be necessary to assess such parameters in the future. On the other hand, self-reporting data is valuable for obtaining subjects\u2019 perspectives and views, but it has potentially selection and recall bias [40]. To avoid such bias, in our study, the self-reported questionnaires were completed by voluntary participants immediately before and after the training and that can be avoided from. Usually, voluntary participants have stronger motivation than other participants which can result in a selection bias. Nevertheless, the similar questionnaires, follow-up duration and criteria selection for enrollment of participants between regular and intervention groups in our study can partially overcome the possible bias of self-reported data. A second limitation was the fact that the intervention FD group completed leadership training and some of the questions on the surveys were leadership-related. To have comparable results, both the regular and intervention FD groups used similar questionnaires for self-assessment in our study. Still, the multiple self-assessment time points in the current study indicated sustained effects of the intervention FD module on leadership training of clinical instructors in delivering, designing and leading CC-based teaching and assessment.",
