To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 1, 2020, the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China have reached 79 968 with 2873 deaths (fatality rate 3.6%). 5 More than 60% of the confirmed cases were reported from Wuhan. 6 Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus species from the genus Betacoronavirus that leads to major epidemics in 21 st century. 3 To prevent the disease transmission, China has suspended all public transport in and out of Wuhan since January 23, 2020. 7 Changsha, a city located 350 kilometers south of the epicenter, reported its first imported COVID-19 case on January 21 and the highest level of public health emergency response was declared two days later. 8 The common symptoms of COVID-19 patients at illness onset include fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea and haemoptysis. 1, 9, 10 Some of these symptoms resemble much like other diseases including flu, which has high occurrence in winter. To avoid the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within hospital, triage procedures for patients were implemented between January 28 and February 20 in a local hospital (Xiangya Hospital) of Changsha to facilitate the .

The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weaker than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but the ability of transmission among humans is stronger.16  During the 24 days of triage, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B as compared to the Section A. 247 individuals were suspected and received careful examination. More than 50% of them did multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis at least 24 hours apart for signs of SARS-CoV-2. Eventually, eight COVID-19 cases were confirmed. Revisiting the patients diagnosed as negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection did not reveal that any COVID-19 patient was missed. Besides different course and severity of illness, delayed sharing of epidemiological history adds another layer of complexity to the diagnosis, underlining thorough diagnostic inquiry.Most COVID-19 patients were identified as positive with one or two rounds of nucleic acid analysis in our study. Two cases (cases 7 and 8) seemed to be more complicated than usual. Case 7 arrived at the Section B with two negative nucleic acid reports already. The course of chest CT images, haematological features as well as previous Wuhan experience prompted three more rounds of nucleic acid analysis and finally confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection using the lower respiratory tract specimen. Case 8 had been enrolled into the hospital multiple times starting before the epidemic was alerted. Though being",
