The first confirmed NYC cases occurred in students attending a high school in Queens, where approximately a third of the 2,700 students developed ILI during the course of a week [4]. In response, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) implemented a multifaceted surveillance approach to understand the severity of illness, and the scope, distribution, and impact of nH1N1 in NYC [3], [5]. In addition to establishing surveillance for more severe illness including deaths and hospitalizations due to nH1N1, we used rapid, population-based telephone surveys to estimate the total burden of ILI and nH1N1 in NYC and, thus, enable rapid estimation of case-fatality and hospitalization rates.",

This size sample was adequate to generate a reliable citywide prevalence estimate yet still be conducted quickly. Household samples of 1000 would typically yield data on more than 2500 persons. The predicted 95% margin of error around an estimated prevalence of 50% in such a sample is less than +/\u2212 2%, even after adjusting for non-response weighting. We used a random-digit dialing telephone sampling methodology to obtain data from a random sample of residential households in NYC. A nonrandom adult from each household was asked to provide information on all household members. Interviews lasted 5 minutes and were conducted in both English and Spanish. Sampled numbers were dialed between five and six times to contact and interview a household, or until the sampled number was determined to be non-working. For the first survey, the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate 3 (RR3) was 8.4% with a cooperation rate of 31.2% [6]. For the second survey, the RR3 was 8.4% with a cooperation rate of 27.9%.",

This system includes daily information on 92% of all hospital ED visits in NYC.

Most cases were coming from the area in Queens surrounding the location of the initial high school outbreak, and from selected parts of Brooklyn. Assuming no geographic variability in the ratios of nH1N1 hospitalizations to nH1N1 prevalence and of nH1N1 prevalence to ILI prevalence, we hypothesized that ILI prevalence in the less affected areas would be largely attributable to causes other than nH1N1. Following this logic, we defined background ILI prevalence as the average prevalence from the initially less affected boroughs, Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island from the first survey, overall and by age group, and assumed the same background rate for the entire survey period. The rates for the first survey period were calculated based on the distribution by date of responses to the May 20\u201327 survey, averaging approximately 23.1 days from May 1 and, thus, giving a 23.1 day prevalence. This estimate was then expanded to the full 50 day period. We then subtracted our estimates of background ILI from the combined ILI prevalence estimates to produce estimates of nH1N1 prevalence for the period May 1\u2013June 19, 2009.",

[10]. The Serfling models estimated the expected number of ILI visits in the absence of any type of influenza and were fit separately by age group and included seasonal terms, linear and quadratic trends, and day of week effects to adjust for differential health seeking behavior. This provided a baseline estimate of daily ILI visits in the absence of influenza for the period May 1st to June 19th. Daily ED ILI visit data from 2009 were then used to reflect combined background ILI and nH1N1 activity and excess visits due to nH1N1 were calculated by subtracting the expected visits from observed values. The daily proportion of ED visits for ILI attributable to nH1N1 were then combined and applied to the ILI estimates for the three survey periods, the two non-overlapping periods and the overlap period, to estimate the prevalence of ILI due to nH1N1.",

The low survey response rate was in part a predictable and necessary consequence of the rapidity with which the surveys were conducted, a limitation that can be expected whenever rapid polling methods are used. Additional survey-related limitations are those associated with any telephone survey, specifically recall, self-report and the potential for those with land line telephones to be different than those in the rest of the population. There are also limitations associated with conducting death surveillance and hospitalization surveillance. If a clinician does not think that a death could be influenza-related and/or fails to conduct testing or report to either public health authorities or the medical examiner, it will not be recognized and counted. Hospitalization surveillance relied in part on initial screening testing with an insensitive rapid antigen test for influenza A, and upon both clinician recognition of influenza and reporting in response to frequent telephone prompts. For ICU surveillance, however, only the clinical recognition of influenza and reporting was a limitation: nH1N1 specific testing was offered to all with acute respiratory illness, including ILI. These limitations all result in under measurement of fatalities and hospitalizations. The strengths of this approach include the rapid availability of the data, and the ability to capture data on children as well as adults. Of note, as of June 2010, no nH1N1 seroprevalence data on NYC residents following the Spring 2009 outbreak has become available to assess the accuracy of the prevalence estimates presented in this paper.",
