Aim of present study is to check the anti-chikungunya activities of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) in the animal cell culture model. The medicinal plant extract was prepared from Z. officinale rhizome. Median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of Z. officinale extract was determined in Vero cell-line on the basis of cell viability followed by MTT assay. In vitro anti-chikungunya activity was performed in Vero cell-line with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale medicinal plant extract. The anti-viral effect of Z. officinale was studied by observing the cytopathic effects and cell viability measured by MTT assay. Maximum non-toxic dose of Z. officinale plant extract was found 62.5 \u03bcg/ml. During anti-chikungunya experimentation, cell viability increased to 51.05% and 35.10%, when Vero cells were pre-treated with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale extract respectively. Similarly, in co-treatment, when MNTD, half of MNTD of Z. officinale and Median tissue culture infective dose CHIKV were inoculated simultaneously, then the viability of Vero cell-line was increases by 52.90% and 49.02% respectively. The rhizome extracts of Z. officinale have high potential to treat CHIKV. Medicinal plants and their metabolites are most important sources of antimicrobial and can be utilized for the development of new drugs. In view of the rapid expansion of CHIKV at the global level, there is an urgent need to develop newer anti-chikungunya drugs.",

            "text": "Chikungunya is a vector born arthritogenic febrile illness caused by an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was the first time isolated from a dengue-like epidemic in Tanzania [1] . CHIKV is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which are also responsible for spreading Dengue and Zika viruses [2] . Apart from the usual clinical manifestations of mosquito-borne infection, CHIKV infected individuals endure extreme joint pain due to over secretion of cytokines that may last for months to years. The rapid expansion of CHIKV on a global scale was facilitated by an ecologically plastic mosquito Aedes albopictus [3, 4] . Comparatively, A. albopictus is more diverse and ecologically stable than A. aegypti, therefore it is found in dominant position in Kenya, Comoros, La' Reunion (France), India, Southeast Asia, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar and Mayotte CHIKV outbreaks [5] . In the present scenario, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious disease (NIAID), USA re-categorized CHIKV into priority group B pathogen of their Emerging Infectious Disease [6] . Complications associated with CHIKV infections include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Encephalomyelopathy, Neonatal Hypotonia, Uveitis, Retinitis, Optic Neuritis, Myelopathy and Myelitis [7] . So far, the CHIKV control measure includes the prevention of infection only. There is no vaccine and antiviral for CHIKV, therefore a specific, economical and effective antiviral molecule desire.",

There is no vaccine and antiviral for CHIKV. Chemically synthesized antivirals have a variety of side effects as compared to natural medicinal plant remedies [22] .According to the Indian Ayurvedic system, Z. officinale (Ginger) is a wellknown medicinal plant and very helpful in controlling gastrointestinal problems by reducing nausea. Ginger is already utilized to treat morning sickness, heartburn, colic, stomach upset, gas, flatulence, bloating, diarrhea, loss of appetite and dyspepsia [23] [24] [25] . Ginger act as an analgesic and helpful for muscle soreness, arthritis, chest pain, stomach pain, low back pain, and menstrual pain. Ginger is a well-known medicinal plant to treat cough, respiratory tract infections, bronchitis. Fresh and dilute juice of ginger is very useful in skin burns treatment. Active components of ginger are utilized as a laxative and antacid medication. As per Ayurveda system, Ginger is well known for the treatment of a variety of cancers including skin, oral, Anti-viral activity of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) ingredients against the Chikungunya virus breast, liver, gastric, pancreatic, colon, renal, prostate, brain, ovarian and cervical cancer.

Our study revealed that Vero cells when pre-treated with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale plant extract, their viability increase 51.05% and 35.1% respectively.

In another study, plant extract and their AgNPs of T. cordifolia, have the potential to interfere with CHIKV and able to increase the 75% and 56% Vero viability when these cells were treated MNTD and half of MNTD, respectively. Medicinal plants are very sensitive, specific and cost-effective against various old and emerging viruses. In another similar study on influenza virus, aqueous Isatidis Radix extract were screening for the anti-influenza property in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, less influenza viruses were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the Isatidis Radix extract pre-treated cells than the cells without Isatidis Radix extract treatment [31] . Despite the huge immunization and modern medication, many viruses lack preventive vaccines and effective antiviral therapies. In the situation, identification of novel antiviral drugs from medicinal plants are more importance as natural products are an excellent source and safer. Medicinal plants are good source of antiviral and effective herbal medicines [32] .",
