            "text": "Based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) can undergo proteolytic cleavage by \u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) to produce a soluble extracellular fragment and a cell membrane-bound fragment [89\u201391]. With its catalytic subunit presenilin, \u03b3-secretase further cleaves the cell membrane fragment to release the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. Mutations in the genes encoding APP or presenilin carry the greatest incidence of familial AD [92]. Under nonpathological conditions, there is evidence that A\u03b2 is involved in regulating synaptic function and even acting as an antimicrobial peptide to protect against infection and injury [93\u201395]. The A\u03b2 peptide can be of varying lengths, the most prevalent being A\u03b240. Longer forms, such as A\u03b242, are less soluble and are prone to accumulate extracellularly to form oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and ultimately, plaques [90, 91, 96\u201398].",

            "text": "In 1999, Schenk et al. published the first immunotherapy for AD: an active vaccine called AN-1792 and comprised of synthetic full-length A\u03b242 with QS-21 adjuvant [99]. The vaccine produced long-lasting and nearly complete clearance of A\u03b2 deposits in many patients, but had no impact on the prominent tau pathology and severe dementia [100, 101]. The trial was halted after 4 patients developed meningoencephalitis related to T-cell infiltration. Successful mapping of the B-cell epitope to the N-terminus of A\u03b2 [102\u2013104] and additional work on Th2-biased adjuvants [103\u2013107] were thus essential to the future A\u03b2 vaccine development, allowing for a robust antibody response without the potentially harmful Th1 lymphocyte activation [108]. Vanutide cridificar (ACC-001) was designed as such to include only the B-cell epitope of A\u03b2 plus QS-21 adjuvant [109]. Phase II trials for ACC-001, however, did not reach efficacy endpoints for cognitive evaluations, volumetric brain MRI, and CSF biomarkers, and development was halted in 2013 [110, 111]. Another recent strategy has been to use mimotopes, synthetic peptides that closely resemble the target protein epitope, as active vaccines. AFFITOPE\u00ae AD02 by Affiris (Wien, Austria), a 6-amino-acid peptide that mimics the A\u03b2 N-terminus, was regrettably also terminated in phase II for lack of clinical efficacy [112].",

CAD106 from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland) fuses a Q\u03b2 virus-like particle to multiple copies of the A\u03b2 N-terminus (a.a. 1-6) [113, 114], and is being tested in homozygous ApoE4 carriers as part of the Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention Initiative (API) program (NCT02565511) [115]. Similarly, ACI-24 by AC Immune (Lausanne, Switzerland) uses A\u03b21-15 peptides anchored to the surface of a liposome and is being tested for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Down\u2019s syndrome [116]. Another N-terminus vaccine, UB-311, is comprised of 2 synthetic A\u03b21-14-targeting peptides linked to helper T-cell peptide epitopes contained in a Th2-biased formula [117]. After completing phase IIa trials for UB-311, United Neuroscience (Dublin, Ireland) is now assessing long-term safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in an extension study (NCT03531710). ABVac40 by Araclon Biotech S.L. (Zaragoza, Spain) began phase II trials (NCT03461276) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) last year and is the only vaccine to use the C-terminal end of A\u03b240 [118].",

            "text": "The first passive immunotherapy to reach phase III trials was bapineuzumab, the humanized murine monoclonal antibody 3D6 [119\u2013121] (Table 1). Bapineuzumab targets the A\u03b2 N-terminus to mediate clearance of both soluble and fibrillar forms, but did not meet clinical endpoints in phase III and, moreover, produced amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with edema in patients that received a high dose [122]. Solanezumab, humanized murine antibody m266, is specific for soluble monomeric A\u03b2 and is proposed to operate by the peripheral sink hypothesis, in which removal of A\u03b2 in the periphery also leads to a reduction in the brain by passive diffusion [123]. Multiple phase III trials, including one in early AD patients, either failed to meet clinical efficacy or were terminated early for futility [124, 125] (Table 1). Similarly, phase III trials for crenezumab, human monoclonal IgG4 against oligomeric, fibrillar, and plaque conformations of A\u03b2, were stopped early in Jan 2019 for futility [126]. However, a phase II prevention trial with crenezumab in Presenilin1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers (NCT01998841) is still underway as part of the API-Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (ADAD) trial in Medellin, Colombia [127] (Table 1). The study is expected to be completed in February 2022 with the primary outcome being change in API ADAD Composite Cognitive Test Total Score at 260 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes include time to MCI or dementia progression because of AD, PET assessment of fibrillar amyloid accumulation, volumetric measurements by MRI, CSF tau biomarker levels, and various measures of memory and neurocognitive function.",

            "text": "Aducanumab was originally slated to take its place among the failed phase III immunotherapy candidates despite being shown to selectively reduce A\u03b2 plaques and slow cognitive decline in earlier trials [128, 129]. Although phase III was halted earlier this year, the company that developed this antibody is now seeking FDA approval with new analysis of a larger data set [85, 130] (Table 1). Similarly, although development of human IgG1 gantenerumab was halted in 2014 for futility, a new phase III trial was initiated at a higher dose (NCT03444870) after the open label extension demonstrated a dramatic decline in A\u03b2 deposition in participants [131]. Both gantenerumab and solanezumab are also being revived as potential preventative therapies by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) in patients with AD-causing mutations (NCT01760005) [132]. Unfortunately, topline analyses in February 2020 showed that both drugs failed to meet primary endpoints [133]. Preventative trials for sporadic AD are also underway, in which the so-called A4 phase III trial (NCT02008357) tests solanezumab at higher doses and for longer durations in asymptomatic patients with preclinical AD as defined by positive amyloid PET scans [134]. This phase III trial recruited over 1200 participants and will be reporting in the next couple of years. Humanized murine mAb158 BAN2401 (NCT03887455) is the only other passive immunotherapy currently in phase III, but has already produced very promising results in phase II. Specifically, the 18-month study demonstrated a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline at the highest dose with less than 10% of subjects experiencing ARIA [135]. The antibody is specific to soluble A\u03b2 protofibrils, which have been proposed to be the toxic species rather than the plaques themselves [136] (Table 1).",

            "text": "In conclusion, despite previous failures in phase III immunotherapy trials targeting A\u03b2, interest has resurged following the recent glimmer of promising results coupled to advances in the early diagnosis and biomarker accessibility of AD. The antibodies currently being tested in clinical trials target a variety of A\u03b2 species, including soluble, oligomeric, and fibrillar A\u03b2. Mechanisms of action include microglia-facilitated removal of extracellular amyloid oligomers and fibrils, blocking primary and secondary A\u03b2 nucleation, and targeting monomers and soluble A\u03b2 in the periphery that could otherwise trigger A\u03b2 accumulation in the CNS. Rather than for late-stage disease reversal, immunotherapy against A\u03b2 aggregates appears to be more appropriate for prevention initiatives with prolonged treatments past 78 weeks at high doses guided by reliable biomarkers. ApoE4 carriers exposed to high doses, however, are susceptible to complications such as ARIA-E and may need to be closely monitored by MRI [137].",

DLB/PD is the second most common cause of dementia and parkinsonism in the aging population after AD, affecting about 1 million in the USA [140]. \u03b1-syn is a presynaptic protein reported to be involved in endosomal formation and vesicle release at the synapse [141, 142]. The pathological hallmarks of PD and DLB are intraneuronal occlusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that are composed of fibrillar \u03b1-syn along with cytoskeletal and other synaptic proteins [143]. \u03b1-syn accumulation can also occur in glia, such as glial cytoplasmic inclusion (GCIs) in MSA patient oligodendrocytes or Lewy body-like structures in the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex of AD and Down syndrome patients [143\u2013145]. Although astrocytes and microglia do not constitutively express \u03b1-syn, they actively uptake extracellular \u03b1-syn which can lead to glial aggregates in conditions of impaired clearance [146\u2013148]. This is supported by increasing evidence that small amounts of \u03b1-syn aggregates are released from neurons into the extracellular space and subsequently interact with glial receptors such as Toll-like receptor 2 to trigger a pro-inflammatory response [40, 146, 149\u2013152].",

            "text": "The original approach to use antibodies to target and remove amyloid plaques from the brain made intuitive sense given that A\u03b2 aggregates are found in the extracellular space [99]. It was unclear how this method might be applied to DLB, PD, and other synucleinopathies, as the majority of the proteinaceous aggregates were thought to form within neurons of the striatonigral system, limbic areas, and deep layers of the neocortex. In the early 2000s, however, we showed that immunization of a newly developed \u03b1-syn transgenic model (Line D, PDGF-\u03b1-syn wt) with recombinant human \u03b1-syn mixed with Freund adjuvant resulted in the production of high titer antibodies against C-terminal \u03b1-syn that were capable of removing \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons and ameliorating neurodegeneration and functional deficits [153]. Through additional active and passive immunization experiments in transgenic, viral, and preformed fibril injection models [154, 155], we learned that these antibodies had multiple mechanisms of action, such as recognizing \u03b1-syn aggregates in the membrane and triggering endocytosis and clearance via autophagy, lysosomal activity, or proteasomal degradation [156\u2013159] (Fig. 4). Moreover, antibodies can be trafficked intracellularly with single-chain antibodies or intrabodies specifically engineered to penetrate the cell membrane via apolipoprotein B (ApoB), TAT fusion proteins, or uptake by endogenous receptors [160\u2013165] (Fig. 4). Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), for example, are designed to retain the specificity of the original full-length antibody without activating unwanted Fc-mediated responses [160, 161, 166]. Several studies have shown that transgenic mice injected with viral vectors encoding scFvs against A\u03b2 [167\u2013169], \u03b1-syn [81, 170], or tau [171, 172] show long-term in vivo scFv expression, improved functional deficits, and reduced pathogenic protein accumulation. Intrabody technology is continuing to be improved, such as in a recent study in which Chatterjee et al. (2018) enhanced the solubility of single-domain immunoglobulin fragments by engineering a polypeptide tether construct, and demonstrated its protective effects on motor function when delivered by gene therapy to a PD rodent model [173].",

Antibodies can also block \u03b1-syn oligomerization and fibrillation, target specific strains and isoforms, prevent cell-to-cell transmission, and facilitate clearance via microglia [61, 149, 155, 176]. Therefore, antibodies can target both intracellular and extracellular \u03b1-syn aggregates as they spread from cell to cell (Fig. 4). This approach has been since applied to other proteinopathies with predominantly intracellular accumulations of tau, TDP43 [177, 178], SOD1 [179\u2013181], RAN peptides [32], and Huntingtin (Htt) [182, 183]. Additional lessons from \u03b1-syn immunotherapy studies include the use of antibodies to develop blood, CSF, and tissue biomarkers to monitor the effects of immunotherapy and the ability of C-terminus-specific antibodies to block protease-mediated C-terminus truncation of \u03b1-syn and subsequently prevent oligomerization and transmission [59, 153, 156\u2013158] (Fig. 4).",

Whereas most antibodies have been developed with recombinant or synthetic \u03b1-syn monomers or aggregates, a recent and novel variant uses antibodies cloned from human healthy volunteers producing high titers of auto-antibodies against \u03b1-syn [184\u2013186]. As a result of seminal cell-free in vitro and in vivo studies, several immunotherapies are currently been tested in clinical trial for synucleinopathies. The vaccines AFFITOPE\u00ae PD01A and PD03A were well tolerated in phase I and produced a dose-dependent immune response in patients with early MSA, but plans for phase II have yet to be disclosed [187, 188]. For passive immunotherapies, prasinezumab (also known as PRX002 or RO7046015) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the C-terminus of \u03b1-syn undergoing phase II trials in patients with early PD (NCT03100149) [189] (Table 2). A phase I trial for BIIB054, a human monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to aggregated \u03b1-syn, was recently concluded and showed favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles [190] (Table 2). MEDI1341 is also in phase I clinical trial testing (NCT03272165) as an antibody that can bind both monomers and aggregates. In preclinical studies, MEDI1341 was shown to readily cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and block transmission of \u03b1-syn aggregates in a combined viral vector model [191] (Table 2).",

Other rising immunotherapy strategies are T-cell modulation, such as that of Copaxone\u00ae [192], and combinatorial approaches. We have tested several of such combinations, including simultaneous administration of 2 AFFITOPEs\u00ae against A\u03b2 and \u03b1-syn [74, 193], nanoparticles containing both recombinant human \u03b1-syn and the immunomodulatory drug rapamycin, and the anti-inflammatory drug thalidomide given alongside a single-chain antibody against oligomeric \u03b1-syn derived from human DLB/PD brains and conjugated to ApoB [73]. Through these studies in DLB/PD mouse models, we show that combined immunotherapy may be more effective than monotherapy. This topic will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. The main challenge in the field of synucleinopathies is the lack of reliable and accessible biomarkers and the overlapping pathology among neurodegenerative diseases.",

By binding to tubulin dimers, tau can stabilize microtubule formation and modulate cytoskeletal dynamics [195]. The degree to which tau is phosphorylated is an important regulator of microtubule stability [196]. Nonphosphorylated forms preferentially bind to microtubules, whereas hyperphosphorylation is associated with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation from paired helical filaments (PHF) [197, 198]. Intracellular NFTs are a major hallmark lesion of AD and other neurodegenerative tauopathies such as FTD, cortico-basal degeneration, Pick\u2019s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) [199]. The severity of tau pathology has been shown to correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment and neuronal loss [200\u2013203], making the tau protein an attractive target for new immunotherapies.",

AADvac1 consists of a B-cell epitope from a cysteinated 12-mer tau peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, a carrier protein that stimulates a Th2 immune response [205]. Based on the promising trends in cognitive improvement and decelerated accumulation of AD biomarkers in trial participants, Axon Neuroscience plans to move forward with the next phase of clinical trials and is also testing the vaccine for primary progressive nonfluent aphasia (NCT03174886) [206, 207]. In another active vaccine, ACI-35, 16 copies of synthetic tau fragments phosphorylated at Ser396 and Ser404 are embedded to the surface of a liposome [116, 208]. In August 2019, AC Immune announced a phase Ib/IIa trial in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Beerse, Belgium) to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the second generation of this vaccine, AC-35.030 [209].",

Antibodies targeting A\u03b2 have led the way with a number of phase III trials and at least one that reported meeting primary outcome measures, followed closely behind by a handful of immunotherapies for \u03b1-syn and tau in phase I and II trials. Whereas accessible biomarkers are currently available for A\u03b2- and tau-related pathologies to guide the immunotherapy trials, there is a pressing lack of such measures for synucleinopathies. The other challenge at hand is that older patients present with protein aggregates that are no longer primarily one pathologic protein species but comprised of A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, TDP43, and others, in addition to aging-related processes such as inflammation, proteotasis deficits, DNA damage, mitochondrial alterations, and stem cell alterations. Thus, there is a dire need to develop reliable biomarkers and powerful combinatorial therapies to address these polyproteinopathies and age-related pathophysiological alterations, as will be discussed in the following section.",

Monotherapy alone may be insufficient against the complex and overlapping pathophysiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

One study reported that 30 to 40% of patients with PD copresent with A\u03b2 plaques and NFTs [233, 234], whereas over 70% of DLB patients [235] and more than 50% of AD patients [236] may have overlapping and, as a result, more aggressive pathology [237]. Indeed, a growing amount of evidence suggests that this copathology directly impacts disease progression. For example, dementia in PD is associated with high levels of AD copathology [235, 238\u2013241]. Several groups have also shown that \u03b1-syn can contribute to the formation of toxic A\u03b2 and tau species, as well as vice versa [242]. Moreover, as stated earlier, demented individuals over the age of 80 present with multiple pathologies including A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, TDP43, inflammatory, and vascular alterations [36]. As such, one therapeutic strategy may be to target the clearance of more than one pathologic protein via immunotherapy.",

            "text": "For example, immunotherapies that generate a response against both \u03b1-syn and A\u03b2 may be more effective than either alone given that \u03b1-syn and A\u03b2 may directly interact in AD patients and APP transgenic models [243\u2013246]. AD patients have been shown to display elevated levels of \u03b1-syn in the CSF [247, 248], and further, A\u03b2 may promote \u03b1-syn aggregation and toxicity [249, 250]. In mouse models, hippocampal neurons with \u03b1-syn accumulations were found to be more susceptible to A\u03b2-mediated toxicity [251], whereas genetic depletion of \u03b1-syn prevented the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and attenuated behavioral deficits [39, 252]. Similarly, \u03b1-syn has been shown to directly interact with PSEN1, which is important for the proteolytic processing of the APP to yield A\u03b2 [231]. \u03b1-syn infusion in APP Tg mice also blocked A\u03b2 seeding but enhanced synaptic degeneration [253, 254], potentially by blocking SNARE-vesicle fusion in a cooperative manner [255]. We recently covaccinated a double transgenic mouse model of DLB (mThy1-hAPP- and mThy1-\u03b1-syn) with AFFITOPE peptides against A\u03b2 (AD02) and \u03b1-syn (PD1A) [74]. Remarkably, targeting one protein often concomitantly lowered the accumulation of another, in which AD02 effectively reduced A\u03b2 pathology as well as that of phosphorylated tau and \u03b1-syn. This study also noted potential additive effects, particularly in alleviating behavioral deficits, suggesting that a combined immunotherapy approach may be appropriate for the heterogenous pathology of AD and DLB and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 5).",

Although both have been shown to form intracellular aggregations, unlike A\u03b2, \u03b1-syn can self-aggregate whereas tau requires an aggregation-inducing agent [257]. Many studies have demonstrated that \u03b1-syn interacts with and catalyzes the oligomerization of tau [258\u2013262]. \u03b1-syn may also demonstrate 14-3-3 cochaperone activity on 14-3-3 targets, including tau, promoting mutual misfolding [263\u2013265]. \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils were shown to induce intracellular tau aggregation in vivo [266], and may be closely involved in the GSK3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of tau in a reciprocal manner [267\u2013270]. \u03b1-syn oligomers may induce a distinctly toxic tau oligomeric strain in a cross-seeding effect [271, 272] or even form coaggregates [273]. A recent paper also reported that an age-dependent reduction in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity was associated with accumulations of lipid-stabilized \u03b1-syn and phosphorylated tau [274]. As such, a combination of immunotherapies against both tau and \u03b1-syn may be especially effective for cases in which both tau and synuclein pathology are present, as it can not only remove existing aggregates and toxic species but also prevent future cross-seeding events.",

This could be achieved by 1) combining vaccines against A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, and TDP43 among other proteins; 2) combining antibodies against A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-syn, and TDP43; 3) combining passive and active immunization; or 4) using multivalent single-chain antibodies that can target 2 or more of these proteins simultaneously. Another approach would be to design antibodies to recognize a conformation that is similar across multiple protein aggregate species, rather than a specific sequence. Interestingly, studies in APP and \u03b1-syn transgenic models have demonstrated that some antibodies against oligomeric tau are effective at reducing \u03b1-syn, whereas others have suggested that antibodies against A\u03b2 may also target tau [61, 275]. Moreover, a combined vaccination approach targeting A\u03b2 and tau has been shown to decrease disease pathology in Tau22/5xFAD double transgenic mice [276]. As such, a combination of these polyfunctional antibodies is another way of maximizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Fig. 5).",

Several studies have shown that \u03b1-syn and tau deletion in animal transgenic models can delay the onset of disease. For example, \u03b1-syn knockout prevented neurotoxin-induced neurodegeneration in MPTP and rotenone PD mouse models [277, 278]. Injecting modified anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting SNCA similarly promoted survival of TH-positive neurons and ameliorated motor deficits in mice expressing wild-type or mutant human SNCA [49]. Another recent study found that tau deletion in A53T \u03b1-syn tg mice rescued some cognitive and synaptic deficits without affecting \u03b1-syn expression or phosphorylation [279]. Gene therapy is also progressing in human neurodegenerative diseases, most notably nusinersen for the neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy [280, 281]. As such, immunotherapy to clear existing aggregates and anti-sense therapy to prevent further translation of pathologic proteins may be a viable combination, particularly in early stages of the disease.",

In this regard, although this review was focused on antibody-based immunotherapy, targeting cellular immunity is another attractive approach to treat neurodegenerative disorders given its ability to reduce the protein aggregate load by targeting T cells. We developed a mixed cellular and active immunization in which \u03b1-syn and rapamycin are simultaneously delivered in an antigen-presenting cell-targeting glucan microparticle (GP) vaccine system [193]. In this case, the \u03b1-syn peptide elicits the production of antibodies against \u03b1-syn, whereas rapamycin triggered the recruitment of Tregs into the CNS. In turn, the Tregs immunomodulate microglia and induce greater microglial clearance of \u03b1-syn aggregates and reduced neurodegeneration and inflammation in \u03b1-syn tg mice. This vaccine, collectively termed GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn, was capable of triggering neuroprotective Treg responses in synucleinopathy animal models, and the combined vaccine was more effective than the humoral or cellular immunization alone. These results demonstrate the promise of multifunctional vaccine approaches for the treatment of AD and DLB/PD.",

Moreover, senescent and immune cells can be targeted with specific antibodies.

Antibodies against interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Toll-like receptors may also be effective at modulating the immune response in neurodegenerative disease [284\u2013287]. Previous studies have shown that A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-syn toxicity are mediated by the inflammasome [288\u2013290]. In the case of synucleinopathies, we have shown that extracellular \u03b1-syn aggregates bind to TLR2 to trigger neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and that selective neutralizing antibodies against TLR2 were effective at blocking these effects and behavior deficits in \u03b1-syn tg animals [152, 291]. In fact, TLR2 has been developed as an important novel target for synucleinopathies [57, 292] (Fig. 5).",

Combinatorial therapeutics will also open exciting opportunities for personalized medicine, including catering to different stages of disease. For example, immunotherapy with anti-sense as described above may be well-suited to presymptomatic stages of disease. Another early intervention may be to combine immunotherapy with means of upregulating proteostasis components such as chemical chaperones or gene therapy for BiP or XBP1 to prevent further misfolding and aggregation [308\u2013311]. Following the onset of significant pathological changes or clinical symptoms, however, polyvalent immunotherapy may be needed to address the frequent presence of multiple pathogenic proteins. Combining polyvalent antibodies with stress signaling inhibitors or regenerative therapy may prevent further synaptic loss and delay progression of symptoms [312\u2013314].",

For instance, given alone, the therapeutic efficacy of statins or antihypertensives for AD [315\u2013321] and PD [322\u2013328] patients remains largely inconclusive. However, a patient presenting with overlapping pathology from both AD and VCID may benefit from a combination of protein-targeting immunotherapy and such cardiovascular disease treatments. Current preventative immunotherapy trials such as that of the API are also just the beginning of genetics-based treatments. Many key initiatives for genetics research in neurodegenerative disease, such as the International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC), are spearheading a movement for accessible analytics tools and diverse and representative data. In the future, we may be able to use this groundwork to identify a patient\u2019s specific risk variants and ultimately design a combinatorial therapy that can address both the protein accumulation and the biological associations for those variants. Let it also not be forgotten, however, that in addition to further development of these therapeutic strategies, there is a dire need for an overhaul of current policy and clinical trial practices in order to truly pursue combinatorial and personalized medicine for diseases as complex as age-related neurodegeneration.",
