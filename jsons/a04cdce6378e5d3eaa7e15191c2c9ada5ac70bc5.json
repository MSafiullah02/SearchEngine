While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that \"on-off\" policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at \"flattening\" the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost.",

            "text": "Given the exponential growth of virus infections, policy makers face the urgent challenge of determining the appropriate response(s). For example, restrictions on population mobility, increased resource investment (e.g., personal protective equipment, ventilators, hospital beds in intensive care units), as well as improved COVID-19 screening can greatly impact the spread of infection. 5;6 Here, fundamental epidemiological models, 7 typically comprising sets of coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), are valuable tools for simulating the dynamics of the epidemic and investigating suppression strategies. Several works (e.g., Anastassopoulou et al., 8 Peng et al., 9 Magal and Webb 10 ) have addressed the development and fitting of such models for the COVID-19 outbreak using regression techniques. Models were subsequently used to characterize the infection, 11 ;12 predict its potential spread, 13;14;15 and/or evaluate mitigation strategies. 16;17 On the other hand, fewer studies have investigated the dynamic optimization, or optimal control, based on epidemiological models in relation to the current COVID-19 outbreak. In this context, the aforementioned epidemiological models are used to determine the policies (i.e., model inputs), such as the social distancing measures and testing rates, that lead to the best outcomes at the population level. Such outcomes include, for example, minimizing the peak number of infected people or total number of deaths, while also accounting for constrained resource availability and the extent to which social distancing is feasible. Among works of this type, Djidjou-Demasse et al. 18 investigated the optimal control of a single \"intervention\" input variable for an ODE model. Moore and Okyere 19 formulated a similar problem with additional inputs, including hospitalization rates and environmental spraying. Both studies solved the optimal control problem using an iterative forward-backward sweep method 20 and assumed the model parameters to be fully known. While optimal control of epidemiological models has been well-studied (e.g., Biswas et al., 21 Neilan and Lenhart 22 ), a limiting factor for implementing modeling and optimization concepts during early stages of an outbreak is that obtaining accurate estimates of key model parameters can be challenging.",

We first formulate a dynamic optimization strategy for identifying both the values of time-invariant parameters and the historical trajectories of time-varying parameters (i.e., inputs) of an epidemiological model. We then investigate how optimal control of the inputs of the same model, which reflect social distancing and testing, relates to infection mitigation strategies. The optimal control problem is cast as a simultaneous dynamic optimization problem (i.e., reformulated as an algebraic problem), 23 enabling the natural use of deterministic global optimization technology. 24 This in turn provides solutions that are proven to be globally optimal, whereas iterative schemes such as the above 20 often only guarantee global optimality under certain conditions (the term \"global\" here refers to the notion that the best possible disease control policy is identified from a set of \"local\" solutions that otherwise satisfy optimality conditions. \"Global\" in this context should not be interpreted as \"world-wide\". Furthermore, we show how state estimation should be used to update important hidden model states (e.g., the number unconfirmed infections) to reduce the impact of model inaccuracy.",

However, the simulated trajectories of p in Italy in Spain deviate slightly from the historical data, especially around day 80 (Fig 2) , suggesting that the death rate \u00b5 may be time-varying. While \u00b5 can vary in reality due to improved treatment, early detection bias, etc., it is difficult to anticipate future changes, and we therefore approximate it as a constant.",

This insight is confirmed by the fitted values for e 0 , with Italy having the highest value and the US the lowest, which is representative of the beginning of the outbreak in each country. In general terms, the identified evolution of containment and testing measures follow similar trends for all four countries, which supports that the model structure is correct and can appropriately reflect (see Methods) different dynamics of the same underlying disease.

The population levels resulting from implementing these two policies are shown in Fig 3, where the numbers of recovered subjects are omitted for the sake of brevity. We additionally show the number of new confirmed cases per day, as it is a commonly used metric to illustrate the current spread/containment of the virus. Since the three European countries showed very similar trends under the two policies considered, we only compare the results for the US to those obtained for Italy. On the one hand, from Fig 3 it is evident that relaxing current control policies can result in an alarming number of infected cases and deaths, particularly in the US. On the other hand, continuing with the strict shelter-in-place measures and maximizing testing can result in earlier and substantially flatter pandemic peaks, with significantly lower numbers of casualties. While the latter approach is the most effective at preventing further exponential spread of the disease, it is also the most socially and economically disruptive policy. In light of this trade-off, we argue that by means of employing optimal control concepts it is possible to find effective policies that maintain the number of infected cases below a given threshold, while minimizing the extent of social and economic disruption.",

Note that the minimum feasible value of i peak corresponds to a peak of 612,493 infected subjects. Therefore, maintaining i(t) \u2264 700,000 requires immediately decreasing \u03b1 a and \u03b1 i to their lower bounds for approximately the next 25 days, during which the exposed population can decrease significantly. After this period, \u03b1 a is relaxed to its upper bound for seven brief periods (Fig  4, left) . However, \u03b1 i remains at its lower bound at all times, reflecting a strict quarantining policy. This policy reveals that the impact of \u03b1 i on the infected population size is larger than that of \u03b1 a . In turn, this suggests that quarantining of infected people is more important than social distancing, which mitigates exposure to unconfirmed cases. \u03ba is decreased during periods of decreased \u03b1 a , suggesting that testing is less important during times of social distancing. Intuitively, when the exposure to asymptomatic subjects is already low due to social distancing, there is less benefit to testing asymptomatic subjects (and transferring them to the similarly quarantined infected population). On the other hand, \u03ba is increased preemptively for each period of increased \u03b1 a , suggesting that testing is most important in the days leading up to a period of relaxed social distancing. This testing moves asymptomatic subjects to the confirmedinfected population, which can remain quarantined. Fig 4 (right) depicts the solution obtained for a value of i peak = 1,400,000 people. While \u03b1 i again remains at its lower bound at all times, re-emphasizing the importance of quarantining infected subjects, there are more frequent and longer periods of increased \u03b1 a . In this case, \u03ba remains at its upper bound for most of the control horizon. In both cases, the optimization problem does not account for the effect(s) of the control policy after 100 days, and growth of the infected population near the end of the time horizon may be concerning. This can be addressed, e.g., using a moving horizon control strategy, where policy measures are revised periodically, as discussed below.",

Furthermore, the current value of \u03b1 a , or social distancing, may not be economically sustainable over longer periods. To investigate the effect of not achieving these proposed levels, we solve the same problem with i peak = 1,400,000 people, using different lower bounds for the inputs. Fig 5 shows the optimal input profiles found for the cases where the lower bound of \u03b1 a is doubled from 0.05 to 0.1 (dotted blue lines), and where the lower bound of \u03b1 i is doubled from 0.01 to 0.02 (solid black lines). When the lower bound of \u03b1 a is doubled (less social distancing is achieved during lock-down periods), the same infected population peak can be maintained by increasing the frequency of social distancing periods. However, when the lower bound of \u03b1 i is doubled (less quarantining is achieved), maintaining the same number of peak infections requires social distancing at almost all times, closely resembling the control policy found for a lower peak (Fig 4, left) . In either case, the optimal value of \u03b1 i remains at its lower bound (either 0.01 or 0.02) at all times and is therefore not shown. Periods of social distancing are further increased in both frequency and duration if both bounds are doubled. Compared to the decreases seen in Fig 3 for the cases of continued control, the solutions in Fig 4 seek to merely flatten the growth of the infected population. The associated optimal control policies resemble \"bang-bang\" control (the inputs are always at the lower or upper bound), which can be expected from a systems-theoretic point of view for (1)-(6), as the equations are linear functions of the inputs \u03b1 a , \u03b1 i , and \u03ba. This result supports the strategy proposed by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, 31 which involves periodic suppression measures. Their strategy triggers the start of a social distancing period by when the number of weekly ICU cases increases past an \"on\" threshold, and the end of the period when the same number decreases below an \"off\" threshold. Fig 4 shows that this type of strategy maintains a low exposed population, and therefore flattens the growth of the infected population while still allowing periods of social mobility.",

Rolling the time horizon of the optimization problem backwards to t 0 = 50, allows us to investigate the optimal inputs for days 50-85, corresponding roughly to the latter half of March and the first half of April. Fig 6 (left) depicts the solution obtained for a value of i peak = 700,000 people. The initial condition at t 0 = 50 was computed by simulating days 1-50. The minimum historical values for \u03b1 a and \u03b1 i were used as their respective lower bounds for days 50-85, such that the optimal control policy for days 50-85 only involves an extent of quarantining and social distancing already experienced by the general population. In this case, maintaining the number of infected subjects below 700,000 appears easy. The minimum feasible peak of infected subjects is 16,543, compared to 612,493 when the optimization starts at day 85. Therefore, maintaining i(t) \u2264 700, 000 can involve extended periods of no social distancing \u03b1 a = 0.5. Similar to the result in Fig 4 (right) , testing and quarantine are important in this scenario: \u03ba remains at its upper bound and \u03b1 i its lower bound. The solution for an order-of-magnitude lower minimum peak, corresponding to 70,000 infected subjects is shown in Fig 6 (right) . The optimal control policy for this scenario involves more frequent periods of social distancing. Early implementation of testing and quarantining strategies clearly has an enormous effect, manifest in the large difference between the historical inputs (dashed) and optimal inputs (solid) in days 50-85 of Fig 6.
