With the objective to achieve sensitive assays for all respiratory viruses, a rational workflow in the laboratory, and a short turn-around time, a real-time PCR diagnostic platform for daily rapid detection of 15 respiratory viruses was developed. The system was evaluated on 585 stored nasopharyngeal aspirates from hospitalized children. Previous analysis by immunofluorescence and virus isolation identified viruses in 37% of the samples while the new PCR diagnostic panel detected 57% virus positive samples. The new platform was introduced in the laboratory in October 2007 and has then fully replaced the standard immunofluorescence assay for rapid detection of viruses and virus isolation.",

            "text": "A clinical laboratory strives to have broad, fast, sensitive, specific, and reproducible diagnostic methods that meet the needs of patients and clinicians. Diagnosis of respiratory agents has traditionally relied on immunofluorescence (IF) and tissue culture isolation. IF is the standard rapid test that can be performed in a few hours. Virus isolation in cell culture is more sensitive than IF, but normally requires days or weeks and therefore rarely delivers results that can guide the treatment of the patient [\u00d6 stlund et al., 2004] . These methods have mainly been used for the diagnosis of RSV and influenza, but also for PIV and AdV. Another diagnostic approach is the use of rapid antigen test kits based on immunochromatography [Ohm-Smith et al., 2004; Templeton et al., 2004; Gunson et al., 2005 Gunson et al., , 2006 Weinberg and Walker, 2005] . Rapid antigen test kits for RSV and influenza detection can be used at the point of care and can be performed within 30 min, but on the other hand suffer from limited sensitivity [Hurt et al., 2007; Smit et al., 2007] . However, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and HBoV can, at present, generally not be diagnosed by IF, virus isolation, or rapid antigen testing. The most recent addition to respiratory virus diagnostics is molecular methods such as real-time PCR. Real-time PCR combines high sensitivity with comparably short analysis time. Real-time PCR generally requires a few hours longer analysis time than the standard rapid test IF, but nevertheless has the capacity to deliver same-day results. In addition, it allows some degree of quantification of the detected virus [Mackay, 2007] . Moreover, out of the methods mentioned above, realtime PCR is the only one suitable for the diagnosis of all respiratory agents.",

High-throughput systems combining PCR with fluid microbead multiplex product detection have also been recently described [Lee et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007] . However, most published assays have not been adapted for large-scale diagnostic use, or lack one or more important virus targets. This prompted the development of a real-time PCR platform for 15 viruses performed in 13 reactions. This diagnostic platform has fully replaced IF and virus isolation in the laboratory. The system was designed with emphasis on efficient handling in the laboratory, minimal hands-on work, short turn-around time, and the capacity to handle many samples during the influenza and RSV epidemic seasons. The primary objective was to expand the diagnostic panel, and at the same time retain or improve the diagnostic sensitivity for influenza, RSV, PIV, and AdV compared to IF. The secondary objective was to obtain a streamlined workflow in the laboratory for respiratory samples, and keep the turn-around time to a minimum. The performance of the real-time PCR assays was evaluated by comparing retrospectively the assays to previous results from IF and tissue culture isolation of 585 stored pediatric nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples.",

Most clinicians agreed that 16.00 hr was an adequate deadline for receiving results. Clinicians considered RSV and influenza reports during the epidemic season of higher priority for decision making, and a rapid separate service for these agents was requested. These requirements led to the daily workflow as shown in Figure 1 . Analyses are offered as two diagnostic packages: a basic package including only RSV and influenza, and a complete package including all 15 tested agents. The choice of analysis package is at the discretion of the clinician, but the extracted material is kept at \u00c0708C, enabling retrospective supplemental testing. This setup resulted in turn-around times between 4 and 8 hr for RSV and influenza analysis during day-time and reports once daily for the other agents. The maximum capacity per run is limited by the 96-well PCR reaction plates as well as the time required for extraction, and is nine samples three times daily for RSV and influenza and nine samples once daily for the complete panel. Every sixth sample is a water negative control. A positive extraction control containing cultured RSV, influenza A and B is included with each run. A pooled RNA control and a pooled DNA control are used for controlling the PCR reactions for each of the remaining agents. In order to aid the clinician's interpretation of the results, separate comments are added to positive results regarding rhinoviruses and enteroviruses describing cross-reactivity. Comments are also added to HBoVpositive results as these findings, in particular at low viral loads, are considered more likely to reflect clinically irrelevant viral shedding and should be interpreted with caution.",

Multiplex assays are more cost effective, but require substantial efforts in design and optimization, and there is a risk of sensitivity loss due to target competition. Individual real-time PCR assays, on the other hand, avoid the problem of target competition, but are associated with higher costs. However, reagent costs are minor compared to labor costs. In the present analysis platform, reagent costs were, in spite of the multiple assay format, estimated to approximately one-third of the total analysis cost. Thus, replacing the very labor-intensive cell culture and IF procedures by PCR did in this case lead to lowered total costs for respiratory virus diagnosis. Another, somewhat unexpected, advantage was reduced after-hours work with IF. An automated, streamlined, and robust system was hence considered more important for cost-effectiveness than minimizing reagent costs. However, future improvements could include transfer to a 384-well format as well as combining the assays to multiplex reactions.",

However, in a large laboratory with a continuous inflow of samples, actual time from sampling to result report depends on a number of factors other than analysis time. Additional important factors are transport time to the laboratory, how frequently analyses are performed, and how analysis results are handled and released from the laboratory. Despite a theoretical analysis time of 90 min for IF, an investigation of the laboratory workflow showed that IF results were very often read and reported only twice daily, resulting in turn-around times of several hours. Moreover, nearly all IF requests concerned diagnosis for RSV or influenza, which occur in the epidemic season. Therefore, the platform was designed for high capacity and rapid results for RSV and influenza, which would at least match the turnaround time of the existing service. Analysis for the other viruses was less frequently requested, and previously diagnosed mainly by virus isolation or not at all, so the new platform could only be a major improvement. For that reason, the analyses come in two diagnostic packages: a basic package containing influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, and a complete package containing all 15 agents. The basic package analyses are performed three times a day and the complete package once daily (Fig. 1) . Having two fixed diagnostic packages streamline pre-analytical logistics and simplify ordering for the clinicians.",

Because of the limited sensitivity, a more accurate second-line analysis will be still necessary, and a broad and sensitive PCR system will be a very suitable second-line test [Nilsson et al., 2008] .

The real-time PCR diagnostic panel was positive for a virus in another 120 samples (20%), increasing the total proportion of positive findings to 57%. Improved sensitivity for RSV, influenza B, and AdV is notable, but the main proportion of the improvement came from detection of agents for which there were previously no diagnostic methods. The exact sensitivity in genome equivalents for each assay was not determined. It was considered of limited clinical relevance as the detection sensitivity in genome equivalents was not determined for the alternative diagnostic methods IF and virus isolation. Comparing analysis results with other diagnostic methods on clinical samples was considered the most relevant performance parameter in this case. The total positive diagnostic outcome of 57% of the 2004-2005 study is comparable to other prevalence studies of respiratory viruses in non-selected patient materials [Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Mahony et al., 2007] . Because the material is not clinically well defined, a large proportion of the diagnostic gap may be due to reasons such as patients sampled late in the course of the disease, patients tested for reasons other than viral respiratory tract disease, or inadequate sampling technique. Thus, 100% positive diagnostic results cannot be expected in a study of this type. In a more strictly defined clinical material, the number of positive findings is usually higher [Jartti et al., 2004] .",

Viral load, estimated from the Ct value, may sometimes help the interpretation. However, the present study indicated that Ct values are informative only for some agents. HBoV has in other studies been co-detected with other viruses in up to 80% of samples [Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007] . In the present study, 60% of HBoV findings were co-infections. HBoV Ct values were significantly lower (viral load higher) in sole HBoV infections than in co-infections (Table III) . This is in agreement with earlier results suggesting that HBoV infections with high viral load in the respiratory tract represent symptomatic primary infection, and those with low viral load represent prolonged virus shedding [Allander et al., 2007; Kantola et al., 2008] . The same tendency was observed for coronaviruses (Table III) . For other viruses, Ct values were generally very similar whether the virus was found alone or in association with other agents (Table III) . Picornaviruses and AdV were the most frequent findings in double infections, mainly in combination with RSV. One may speculate that RSV is usually the main pathogen in these cases, but the present study could not provide evidence for this assumption.",
