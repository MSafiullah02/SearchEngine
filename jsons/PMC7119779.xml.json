Among these assays, RT-PCR and real-time PCR are recognized as the most sensitive methods currently available, but the drawbacks are that they require expensive special equipment and skilled technologists. Additionally, they are more time consuming and costlier than the rapid ICG test. This study was performed to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of a newly developed rapid ICG test (SD Bioline Norovirus test) for detecting human norovirus genogroups GI and GII in stool specimens.",

The norovirus in the specimen reacts with colloidal gold-labeled norovirus-specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing both GI and GII strains, thus forming a complex of antigen-antibody colloidal gold conjugates. As this complex migrates along the result window by capillary action, it is captured by norovirus-specific monoclonal antibodies immobilized in the test line positioned across the result window, and a colored line is generated. In the absence of norovirus, a complex is not formed, and no colored line appears. Frozen fecal suspensions were warmed to room temperature, and 100 \u03bcL of fecal suspension was added to a tube containing 1 mL of diluent (1:10 dilution) and mixed well. Four to 5 drops (approximately 100\u2013125 \u03bcL) were added to the sample well of the test device, and results were read after 15 min. In samples with negative ICG and positive real-time PCR results, 200 \u03bcL of fecal suspension was mixed with 200 \u03bcL diluent (1:1 dilution) instead of 1 mL diluent, and the test was repeated.",

For the RIDA GENE Norovirus V assay (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany), 5 \u03bcL of RNA extract was mixed with 20 \u03bcL of master mix and real-time RT-PCR was performed using a PCR thermocycler (Rotor-Gene Q, Qiagen) with the following program: reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min; 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s. For the assay with the AccuPower Norovirus Real-Time RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea), 5 \u03bcL of RNA extract was mixed with 45 \u03bcL of master mix, and real-time RT-PCR was performed using a PCR thermocycler (Exicycler 96 Real-Time Quantitative Thermal Block, Bioneer) with the following program: reverse transcription at 45 \u00b0C for 15 min; pre-denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and annealing/extension at 55 \u00b0C for 5 s. All the procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To quantify the copy number of norovirus RNA, in vitro transcribed RNA calibrators were prepared as follows. The amplicon of the target region in the norovirus genome was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and HIT-DH5\u03b1 competent cells (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan) were then used for transformation. The cloned plasmid was purified using the Accupower plasmid mini kit (Bioneer), and in vitro transcription of the target region was conducted by MAXIscript\u00ae SP6 Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mass of in vitro transcribed RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and converted to copy number ([X g/\u03bcL RNA/(transcript length in nucleotides \u00d7 340)] \u00d7 6.022 \u00d7 1023\n = Y molecules/\u03bcL; http://www.qiagen.com/resources/info/guidelines_rtpcr/quantifying.aspx).

If consistent positive or negative results from 2 different real-time PCR assays are regarded as \u201ctrue positives\u201d or \u201ctrue negatives,\u201d the sensitivity of the new assay is 90.2% and the specificity is 100%. Commercial norovirus antigen test kits can be broadly classified into 2 types: the ICG type and the ELISA type. The RIDAQUICK Norovirus assay from R-Biopharm is the most widely used ICG assay, and the QuickNavi-Noro kit (Denka Seiken, Japan), IP-NORO kit (Immuno-Probe, Japan), and IC kit (Morinaga Milk Industry, Japan) have also been introduced. For ELISA testing, the RIDASCREEN Norovirus kit, IDEIA Norovirus kit (Oxoid, UK), and Denka ELISA kit (Denka Seiken, Japan) are currently being used. However, various sensitivities and specificities have been reported for these kits, even for different studies using a single test kit. The sensitivity of 90.2% (95% confidence interval, 82.2\u201395.4%) obtained in this study for the SD Bioline ICG assay is similar to or higher than the reported sensitivities of the RIDAQUICK (57.1\u201383%), QuickNavi-Noro (88.6%), IP-NORO (73.7\u201378.9%), IC Kit (75.4%), RIDASCREEN (36\u201392%), IDEIA (38\u201376.9%), and Denka ELISA (80\u201390.4%) tests (Bruggink et al., 2011, Bruin et al., 2006, Bruins et al., 2010, Burton-MacLeod et al., 2004, Costantini et al., 2010, Derrington et al., 2009, Khamrin et al., 2008, Khamrin et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2011, Kirby et al., 2010, Nguyen et al., 2007, Siqueira et al., 2011, Wilhelmi de Cal et al., 2007). Its specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 97.1\u2013100%) is the same as or better than that of existing ICG tests (89.5\u2013100%) and ELISA methods (69\u2013100%) (Bruin et al., 2006, Bruins et al., 2010, Burton-MacLeod et al., 2004, Castriciano et al., 2007, Costantini et al., 2010, Derrington et al., 2009, Khamrin et al., 2008, Khamrin et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2011, Kirby et al., 2010, Nguyen et al., 2007, Park et al., 2012, Siqueira et al., 2011, Wilhelmi de Cal et al., 2007). Furthermore, there were no cross-reactions with various types of viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and no interference by substances that can appear in the feces, such as blood, hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglyceride, anti-diarrhea drug (loperamide), and antibiotics (metronidazole).",

This is supported by the observation that (1) no specimens tested positive in ICG and negative in PCR, whereas 9 specimens tested positive in PCR and negative in ICG; and (2) the Ct values of 8 of these specimens were >30, indicating low norovirus concentrations.",

            "text": "Several reasons may contribute to the differences in sensitivity and specificity among the samples analyzed using the same kit. The first reason is the characteristics of the specimen, including whether the specimen is from an adult or a child, whether it is a specimen taken during an outbreak period, whether it has been taken from a subject strongly suspected to be infected with norovirus or from a healthy subject, whether it is a stored or fresh specimen, and the conditions of specimen storage or treatment (if any). The second reason is that the sensitivity and specificity of the test method can vary depending on the sensitivity and specificity of the comparative method, real-time PCR. The third reason is the diversity of genotypes within norovirus-positive specimens or the distribution of norovirus concentrations within samples. As norovirus comprises genogroups I\u2013V and different genogroups or subtypes can be detected with different efficiencies by different kits, the sensitivity or specificity of the kit can differ depending on the range of genotypes in the samples. According to the manufacturers\u2019 data, the test kits used in this study could detect the GI.1, 4, and 11, and GII.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, and 16 genotypes. Another important factor in determining sensitivity is the virus concentration in the positive specimen group. The Ct values for real-time PCR for most PCR-positive samples in this study were 15\u201330, indicating that they contain high concentrations of norovirus. The fact that the specimens used were identified as positive or negative in 2 different PCR tests could increase the sensitivity and specificity of the assays in this study. Another factor that influenced the sensitivity and specificity in this study was the use of pre-diluted (10\u201320% fecal suspension; 1:5\u20131:10 dilution) frozen fecal suspension. According to the manufacturer's instruction, fresh, refrigerated, or frozen fecal specimens were recommended, not pre-diluted frozen fecal suspensions. In this study, therefore, in the case of samples with negative ICG and positive real-time PCR results, 200 \u03bcL of fecal suspension was mixed with 200 \u03bcL diluent instead of 1 mL diluent (total dilution titer was 1:10\u20131:20 dilution, which is similar to that of the original procedure of this assay using stool), and the test was repeated. Because of the similar dilution titer in the repeated test, this modified procedure involving pre-dilution might not decrease the sensitivity of the assay. However, the protocol in this study could increase the specificity of the assay due to the absence of repeated measurement with pre-diluted samples showing negative results.",

The reproducibility was nearly 100% at concentrations above or below the detection cutoff. Although lot 1 (lot no. 189001) exhibited the least sensitivity and lot 3 (lot no. 189003) showed the greatest sensitivity, the difference in sensitivity between the lots was within 1-fold dilution. The difference between lots may explain the varying sensitivities that have been reported although the same test kit was used, and continuous improvements in the kits may explain the increased sensitivity in more recent reports.",
