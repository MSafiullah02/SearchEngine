The main type of organizations covered by our survey included HTA agencies, public administrations, and research institutes. Seventy-one % of the institutions reported engagement in any aspect of HTA in the area of PH (N = 37). Among those, 81% evaluated less than 5 PH technologies from 2013 to 2018. The most common barriers for reaching a decision on PH technologies were lack of data, conflicting stakeholder priorities, and methodological issues. A total of 76 PH interventions were reported, and most cited initiatives were related to chronic disease screening, prevention of infectious diseases, and maternal, prenatal, and neonatal screening.",

The implementation of collaborative HTA approaches in the setting of PH practice and policy needs to be prioritized and further strengthened. Moreover, ensuring reliable data structures and consolidation of HTA methods for the evaluation of PH technologies will be crucial for tackling the enormous burden of non-communicable diseases in societies.",

The authors also observed numerous, and often unjustified, changes to recommendations such as adaptations in the processes of quality evaluation, assessment of applicability, and integration of qualitative and quantitative evidence (12, 13) . These methodological tweaks were mainly linked to the fact that complex PH interventions implement diverse methodologies that often fall outside a controlled experimental setup such as those processed in randomized controlled trials.

The survey question on the most important reasons for conducting a PH assessment allowed several answers per respondent. The reason most frequently reported in this survey was the need to identify whether a PH intervention represents a better alternative to standard procedures (75%).

Although the majority of the reported assessments focuses on primary and secondary prevention programs, it appears that in many cases the targeted populations are already benefiting from some form of clinical monitoring or care provisions, indicating that the prevention intervention approaches are more frequently delivered within the healthcare setting, thus not reaching the far higher number of concerned (atrisk) citizens who do not access healthcare services. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of implemented initiatives that are linking primary care with sources of community support, but the evidence about their effectiveness and methodological rigor is limited (17) . The key issue with building the evidence base for initiatives such as social prescribing as well as PH interventions in general lies in the fact that applying the golden standard of evidence (i.e., double-blinded randomized controlled trials) might not be adapted. Pragmatic trials, as a more naturalistic approach, might provide a better picture of effectiveness, while evidence summaries may include a realist synthesis as opposed to standard systematic review approaches (12, (18) (19) (20) . This being said, it should be kept in mind that good evidence does not necessarily lead to good policy (21) . In our survey, <5% of the interventions focused on behavior. The evaluation of behavioral and lifestyle interventions remains extremely rare in spite of their importance for developing effective population health strategies and establishing health systems. This notwithstanding, PH researchers and other non-HTA professionals frequently study a variety of approaches for prevention interventions that directly target the general population (22, 23) . However, associated recommendations and more generalized implementation of campaigns and interventions do not belong to their mainstream responsibilities. Moreover, very few behavioral trials have been registered and many of them lack transparent reporting (24) . It is thus important to emphasize that rigorous conduct as well as transparent reporting need to be implemented.",

Lifestyle research has to do with socio-economic aspects including behavior sciences and drivers of individual choices; effective PH management therefore requires an integrated perspective on the health-disease continuum (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) . The resulting uncertainties (41) , the fact that benefits at the population level might not necessarily be synonymous to benefits for single individuals, as well as a lack of insight in the variability of the many underlying causal pathways (42) often lead to a de-prioritization of preventive interventions on the population level, emphasizing that collaborative approaches among different professionals (from PH practitioners to behavioral scientists, psychologists, community and social workers, etc.) will be crucial for implementing efficient and effective interventions once the decision has been made.",

One of the plausible explanations is that political incentives are lacking since the benefits of PH interventions usually arrive after the mandate of current politicians and policy makers (43) . Furthermore, it could be related to a lack of interest due to the inexistence of promoters as it is the case of other technologies that are designed and marketed by companies with an obvious business interest in their marketing.",

However, this will likely lead to an extension of the survey and fewer responses of individuals. There were clear differences concerning the accuracy of fit. Nevertheless, there has been coding in all four categories of interventions. Differences were found in the three axes of each ICHI measure (target, action, and means).

Reshaping the current public health HTA methods and related practices of policy priority setting will be crucial for implementing efficient and effective interventions.
