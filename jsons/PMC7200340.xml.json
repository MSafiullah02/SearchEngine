By the time the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, our hospitals were already preparing for an unprecedented crisis. Travel restrictions were being imposed, social distancing measures implemented, and academic conferences cancelled. Elective outpatient care was being cancelled, while healthcare providers were learning new telemedicine skills or preparing to be redeployed as COVID care providers.",

Importantly, this document \u2013 which was also endorsed by the American College of Cardiology \u2013 is a \u201clive document\u201d and will be continuously updated on the SCCT website as our collective expertise and clinical needs evolve.

Of course, we will also have sessions on how cardiac CT and cardiovascular imaging can be used to evaluate COVID-19 patients. Importantly, there will be several advantages to our new on-line format. Participants will be able to select between different \u201cchannels\u201d and will not feel that they have to miss-out by having to choose between 2 different rooms, as is sometimes the case during a live meeting. There will be several opportunities for participants to interact with each other and with SCCT leaders, and we will also deliver some of the signature SCCT games so popular at previous meetings. With no need for travel, we anticipate that this will be our highest attended meeting, and look forward to welcoming individuals from all over the globe!",

This is especially important for the field of cardiac CT, as we now have an even greater opportunity and need to demonstrate the value and efficiency of our services. Whether it is avoiding invasive angiography, reducing the need for other cardiac tests, reducing hospital admissions, or simply identifying individuals who can be safely managed with medical therapy[2], the role of cardiac CT has never been so important.[3, 4] Nevertheless, even though cardiac CT is an essential test in hospitals who care for patients with COVID-19, access to this test is often limited. As a result, the current benefits of cardiac CT can only be realized by institutions that have invested in such programs. We as a society must help eliminate barriers for cardiac CT delivery and ensure that reimbursement for our services correctly reflects the costs.[5] To that end, perhaps one thing that has not changed in the last few months is that advocacy for cardiac CT has never been more important.\n",
