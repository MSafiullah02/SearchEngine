The PEDV membrane protein (M) plays crucial roles in viral assembly, viral budding and host immune regulation, most likely by interacting with host cell proteins that have yet to be identified. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) using an M-specific monoclonal antibody\uff0ccoupled with LC-MS/MS\uff0cwas employed to identify M protein-interacting proteins in PEDV-infected cells. Three viral proteins (S, E and ORF3) and 218 host cell proteins were identified as putative M-interacting partners.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a highly contagious disease with a high mortality rate in neonatal pigs. PED was first reported among feeder and fattening pigs in England and Belgium during the 1970s (Wood et al., 1977) . The disease was first recorded in China during the 1980s, and a more virulent form of the virus appeared in 2010 (Wang et al., 2013) . PEDV is an alphacoronavirus assigned to the family non-structural proteins (pp1a and pp1ab), and an accessory gene (ORF3) located between the S and E genes. The M protein, a component of the outer envelope of the viral particle, is categorized as a type III glycoprotein consisting of a short amino-terminal ectodomain, three successive transmembrane domains, and a long carboxy-terminal inner envelope domain (De Haan et al., 2000) . The protein J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f participates in viral assembly through interaction with the S and N proteins, viral budding (De Haan et al., 2000; Klumperman et al.,1994; Arndt et al., 2010) , and may also mitigate the host innate immune responses. For instance, M protein is reported to induced cell cycle arrest at the S-phase via the cyclin A pathway (Xu et al., 2015) and may modulate the host innate immune responses by inhibiting the IFN-\u03b2 and IRF3 promoter activities (Zhang et al., 2016; Song et al., 2012) . As obligate parasites, viruses rely on host: pathogen protein-protein interactions to modulate the ongoing biochemical activities of the host cells so that they benefit virus proliferation (Crua et al., 2017) . However, the interactome profile of PEDV M protein in host cells is still unclear although, in order to fulfill the aforementioned functions of M proteins, their interaction with a large number of host cell proteins would be expected to occur. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to generate an interactome profile of PEDV M protein and to identify the viral and host cell protein interactions. M protein, the L subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3(eIF3L), and Rab11A, CDC42 and H2AFY expression plasmids containing tags were generated using the homologous recombinant method. All the primer sequences in this study will be made available upon request. M-HA gene was amplified by RT-PCR using PEDV DR13 RNA as template, and cloned into vector pCAGGS-HA with homologous recombinant reagent (one-step cloning kit, Vazyme, China) to form the recombinant plasmid pCAGGS-M-HA. RT-PCR using full-genome RNA of Vero cells as template was employed to amplify the eIF3L/Rab11A/CDC42/H2AFY-Flag genes, which were cloned into vector pCAGGS with homologous recombination reagent to obtain the recombinant plasmids pCAGGS-eIF3L/Rab11A/CDC42/H2AFY-Flag, respectively. All the plasmids were verified by sequencing.",

Co-IP and LC-MS/MS identified three viral proteins (Spike-S, Envelope-E and ORF3) and 218 host cell proteins that appeared to interact with M protein in PEDV DR13 att -infected Vero cells. Coronavirus (CoV) studies have shown that the M protein interacts with E protein and S proteins during the assembly of the CoV envelope (Nguyen and Hogue., 1997; Opstelten et al.,1995) . In the present study, both the PEDV S and E proteins were immunoprecipitated together with the M protein, indicating an interaction with the latter. Our data also showed that anti-M mAb immunoprecipitated truncated ORF3 protein in PEDV DR13 att -infected cells, which suggested an interaction between the ORF3 and M proteins. Accessory proteins from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 have also been shown to interact with M, S and E proteins (Tan et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2010) . hCoV-NL63 ORF3 is a structural viral protein incorporated into viral particles (Muller et al., 2010) while PEDV ORF3 is involved in many host cell processes and in viral replication (Si et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2015; Kaewborisuth et al., 2018; Wongthida et al., 2017) . The likelihood of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f interaction between PEDV M and ORF3 proteins suggests that the latter cooperates with M to take part in the process of PEDV assembly and budding.",

Rab proteins are a subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that are known to regulate specific intracellular membrane trafficking pathways (Spearman 2018) . Among the six subfamily members, Rab11A has been studied most extensively in terms of its role in viral budding and release. Rab11 is reported to be essential for viral budding and release in RSV and HIV-1 (Brock et al., 2003; Varthakavi et al., 2006) . Rab11A also played a role in influenza virus morphogenesis and budding, and depletion of Rab11 decreased viral titers by up to 100-fold (Bruce et al., 2010) . Furthermore, Rab11A promoted porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication in a manner that correlated with autophagy (Wang et al., 2017) . Rab11A may serve a similar function in the proliferation of PEDV, PRRSV and influenza viruses. However, our siRNA studies failed to reveal any correlation between Rab11A expression levels and PEDV production although the knockdown of the Rab11A gene may not have been sufficiently strong enough to interfere with the Rab11A protein-M protein interaction. Alternatively, other routes may exist that replace the function of Rab11A, and future studies will further investigate the role of Rab11A in PEDV infection.",

These proteins were enriched in a variety of signaling pathways, including immune response, cell cycle and apoptosis, and are involved in a wide diversity of biological processes. Among the identified proteins, eIF3L influenced the proliferation of PEDV. Our findings should serve to elucidate novel functions of M and host cell proteins in PEDV-infected cells.",
