            "text": "Little attention has been given to the role of smoking in either the transmission of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, actual virus) or mortality rate of Covid-19 (name of the disease caused). Smokers contract more respiratory ailments, including colds (commonly rhinoviruses, but also coronaviruses) than non-smokers. Smokers also show double the influenza rate and increased rates of bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis [1,2,3,4,5]. The damage caused to the lungs by smoking makes patients more susceptible to pulmonary infections, both bacterial and viral [6]. Smokers are 34% more likely than non-smokers to contract the flu [6]. Han and colleagues conclude that literature evidence showed that smoking was consistently associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions after influenza infection [7]. Smoking is the primary etiological factor behind chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the developed world, but environmental pollution and degrading air quality are also responsible in developing countries. It is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world [8]. Vaccination against influenza is strongly recommended for patients with COPD, as the frequency and progression of exacerbations are strongly linked to respiratory viruses in 30% of cases [1]. Rubin et al. found that COPD patients who were prone to viral infections had higher exacerbation rates, more inflammation, and loss of lung function compared to those with existing exacerbating disease conditions [9]. Symptomatology and mortality in influenza-infected smokers were also enhanced [9]. According to the WHO, comorbidities are associated with a high percentage of Covid-19 related deaths [10,11]. In conjunction with the complications arising from comorbidities in patients who smoke [12], we put forth the question of whether smoking, smoking-induced health conditions, and comorbidities, in combination, is culminating in a high risk demographic for both contraction of the virus and the severe presentation of Covid-19.",

The initial age distribution of Covid-19 cases was skewed towards older age groups with a median age of 45 years (IQR 33\u201356) for patients who were alive or who had an unknown outcome at the time of reporting. The median age of patients who had died at the time of reporting was 70 years (IQR 65\u201381) as reported by Sun and colleagues [14].

The distinguishing crown-like feature of coronaviruses is attributed to the presence of large type 1 transmembrane spike (S) glycoproteins. This heavily glycosylated cell surface protein contains two distinct functional domains (S1 and S2) which are thought to mediate host cell entry by the virus. The S1 domain contains the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain and is responsible for first stage host cell entry [16]. The S2 domain facilitates fusion between cell and virus membrane, required for cellular infiltration [17]. S proteins are enzymatically modified, exposing the fusion site for cellular adhesion. This is achieved through cleavage by cellular proteases, mediated by protein convertase called \u201cfurin\u201d [17,18]. Furin is expressed significantly in the lungs, and respiratory viruses also utilize this system to convert their surface proteins [17]. Although the S protein cleavage site is less observed in coronavirus with similar genomic sequence [17], it is essential to note that more pathogenic influenza viruses share similar cleavage sites [19].

Recent studies have found that the modified S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly higher affinity for ACE2 and is 10- to 20-fold more likely to bind to ACE2 in human cells than the S protein of the previous SARS-CoV [28,29]. This increase in affinity may enable easier person-to-person spread of the virus and thus contribute to a higher estimated R0 for SARS-CoV-2 than the previous SARS virus. The ACE2 protein is expressed on the surface of lung type-2 pneumocytes [30]. It could thus act as a novel adhesion molecule for Covid-19 and be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections in the community. ",

            "text": "An early suggestion is that ACE2 is upregulated on the airway epithelium of smokers. Guoshuai Cai recently reported higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to never-smokers. Zhao et al. observed that ACE2 is expressed explicitly in type-2 pneumocytes, in which genes regulating viral reproduction and transmission are highly expressed [31]. This indicates that smokers may be more susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and possibly Covid-19. We recently identified enhanced ACE2 expression in resected lung tissue from patients with COPD and healthy lung function smokers, albeit comparably less in the latter, while entirely absent in heathy non-smoking individuals (Figure 1). ACE2 expression was quite evident in the type-2 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and the apical end of the small airway epithelium. COPD patients showed significantly higher levels of ACE2, suggesting that COPD further exaggerates ACE2 and potential SARS-CoV-2 adhesion site. ACE2 expression could also be true for patients with another chronic lung disease such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [32]. The attachment of the virus to cell surface ACE2 protects them from immune surveillance mechanisms, leaving them tagged to the host for relatively longer periods, thus making them an efficient carrier and vulnerable host for future infections and spread. The eventual engulfment of ACE2 further provides the virus access to the host cells system, thus providing a flourishing environment, not just to sustain and proliferate but also to mutate and modify host evasion mechanisms. Previous observations using in vivo knockout mice models suggest that SARS-CoV-2 adhesion on ACE2 could also downmodulate the expression of ACE2 itself. This, in turn, increases the production and activation of other related ACE enzymes. This differential modulation and the drastic reduction in ACE2 results in severe acute respiratory failure [33,34].",

Smokers, as a vulnerable group, must be supported to quit and should be advised to avoid areas where they may be liable to be exposed to Covid-19, especially smokers with pre-existing respiratory health concerns.
