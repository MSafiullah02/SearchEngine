Calls were excluded as ineligible if the call data indicated that the illness was not acute. We initially defined acute illness as \u22643 days' duration. However, on January 14, 2015, we changed the definition to \u22647 days' duration due to the large number of callers reporting illness of 4\u20137 days' duration. Study staff attempted to contact each potentially eligible patient by phone to verify eligibility; consenting patients were enrolled into the study.
