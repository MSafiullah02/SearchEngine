The treatment regimen was ventilatory support, high-flow oxygen, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir antiviral therapy, interferon \u03b1-1b, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Notably, 11 days after admission, the patient\u2019s lung lesions continued to progress, and the ventilator was unable to maintain oxygen saturation. The ventricular septum thickened to 14 mm, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased to 272.40 pg/mL. Therefore, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to reduce the cardiopulmonary burden. The rotating speed of ECMO was 3500 rpm, the blood flow rate was 4.30 L/min, the air-flow rate was 4.00 L/min, and FiO2 was 100%. At one time, the patient's condition improved. A blood test 3 days later revealed that Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, NTBNP was 750 pg/mL, and IL-6 was 7.63 pg/mL. After treatment, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%, the left ventricle and wall thickness returned to within their normal ranges, and the bedside chest film suggested that the lesion had decreased. However, infection-related markers increased gradually from the 26th day, and vasoactive drugs were needed to maintain blood pressure. Candida, human \u03b1-herpesvirus, and \u03b2-herpesvirus were detected in BALF on the 29th day, and blood culture was positive for Bacteroides ovalus, indicating the aggravation of secondary infection. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) showed sudden declines on the 26th and 29th days, suggesting impaired right cardiac function. After consultation with the expert group, anti-infection treatment was strengthened, but the effect was not good. Septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) gradually developed, and ecchymosis was widely observed in the skin. The patient died on the 33rd day of hospitalization.",

However, to date, there is no case report that clearly suggests that COVID-19 can cause fulminant myocarditis. Fulminant myocarditis is mainly caused by a variety of viral infections and is characterized by the rapid occurrence of cardiogenic shock. In this case, the patient had the following features: sudden onset, obvious symptoms of viral infection, rapid emergence of severe hemodynamic disorders, severe myocardial injury, and diffuse decreased ventricular wall movement. The above features are all in accordance with the diagnostic criteria of fulminant myocarditis [5]. This patient\u2019s PASP gradually increased, suggesting that the pulmonary lesions were gradually aggravated. PASP and TAPSE suddenly decreased several days before death; this was considered to be related to functional decline in the right heart caused by sustained overload.",

Echocardiography was performed in patients with abnormal myocardial injury markers, and only two patients were found to have reduced LVEFs and were diagnosed with fulminant myocarditis. Studies have confirmed that coronavirus infection can cause myocarditis and even congestive heart failure [6]. Other respiratory viruses have also been found to cause heart damage and coronary heart disease [7], and in this study, more than half of the patients who died had elevated Trop I during hospitalization. It has been reported that some severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) patients have temporarily abnormal myocardial enzymes and may develop acute myocarditis and acute-onset heart failure [8, 9]. In this case, the patient had no history of heart disease; therefore, the decreased cardiac function was likely to be caused by COVID-19.",

In COVID-19 autopsy studies, mononuclear inflammatory infiltration in the heart tissue, but no clear viral inclusion body was observed [10]. The rapid recovery of cardiac structure and function without significant decrease or even slight increase in viral load suggests that apart from viral replication in the myocardium, it is possible that immune response/cytokine storms may also play a significant role [11, 12]. The patient in this case had significantly elevated IL-6, suggesting the presence of a cytokine storms. Cytokine storms may lead to increased vascular wall permeability and myocardial edema, which may explain the thickening of the interventricular septum in this patient. In addition, hypoxia can lead to early and substantial inflammatory responses and cell damage, which may cause rapid and considerable damage to the heart [13]. CRRT and ECMO remove some of the cytokines from the blood and increase blood oxygen saturation, reducing the excessive immune response of cytokines in the body and further reducing myocardial damage. Furthermore, a study showed that complete atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation are risk factors for in-hospital death in fulminant myocarditis patients [14]. The absence of such electrocardiogram anomalies in this case may have contributed to the rapid improvement in the patient\u2019s heart condition, and the prognosis of this patient may have been better if secondary infection could have been controlled.",

            "text": "COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure. This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis. The lessons learned from this case are as follows: first, the heart is a secondary target organ after the lungs. It cannot only present with abnormalities in markers of myocardial injury, but also structural and functional damage. Second, immune-related injury may be the main mechanism of myocardial injury associated with viral infection. Third, the sudden decline in PASP and TAPSE may indicate that the course of disease is entering the late stage. The important question of whether COVID-19 can cause direct cardiac pathology requires further study.",
