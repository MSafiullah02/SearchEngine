The response is frequently characterized by a series of emergency activities to contain and manage the infection in human populations, and at the same time to identify the source of the infection in nature. If infection is found to have a source in animals, and if animals cause a continuous threat of human infection, culling is often recommended with severe economic impact. Currently, efforts are being undertaken for closer interaction at the animal/human interface through joint surveillance and risk assessment between the animal and human medicine sectors, and research is underway in geographic areas where emergence at the animal/human interface has occurred in the past. The goal of this research is to identify infectious organisms in tropical and other wild animals, to genetically sequence these organisms, and to attempt to predict which organisms have the potential to emerge in human populations. It may be more cost-effective to learn from past emergence events, and to shift the paradigm from disease surveillance, detection, and response in humans; to prevention of emergence at the source by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that influence animal infection. These determinants are clearly understood from the study of previous emergence events and include human-induced changes in natural",

Better understanding of these factors learned from epidemiological investigation of past and present emergence events, and modeling and study of the cost-effectiveness of interventions that could result in their mitigation, could provide evidence necessary to better address the political and economic barriers to prevention of infections in animals. Such economically convincing arguments for change and mitigation are required because of the basic difference in animal health-driven by the need for profit; and human health-driven by the need to save lives. 1 Infections at the Animal/Human Interface Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was the first major emerging infection identified during the twenty-first century (Parashar and Anderson 2004) . A close examination of the outbreak-its origins, the human sickness and death it caused, the national and international responses that occurred, and the effect these responses had on Asian economies-provides a clear lesson of the importance of emerging infections at the animal/human interface, and underscores the reasons that emerging infections must be rapidly detected, assessed, and managed. But understanding and mitigating the factors that align to cause emergence could move this current paradigm of detection, assessment, and response further upstream, to prevention of emergence at its source.",

Animals come in contact with humans or other animals as they range (e.g. cows and chickens in parts of Asia) or browse (e.g. urban foxes and rodents) (Bradley and Altizer 2007). The continued high rate of contact between humans and poultry in both smaller backyard farms and larger market system farms continues to permit repeated human exposure to the H5N1 influenza A virus that is endemic in poultry stock. Children and adults are thought to have been infected by contact with living chickens in backyards, and adults have been shown to become infected at some point during the process of raising or slaughtering/butchering chickens (Kerkhove et al. 2011) .",

Growing demand for animal-based food has led to the ever more complex food chains that involve live animal processing and trade networks (Schlundt et al. 2004 ). Prevention of infectious disease emergence through the food chain and agricultural system requires understanding of the risks at each step along the pathway from the farm to the fork. If infectious agents pass through the food chain and enter foods, their impact can be minimized at the final intervention point, where animalderived foods can be prepared carefully in the factory, restaurant, and household either by cooking or other means to remove or mitigate the risk of infection. Others must be controlled earlier-during the period animals are being raised, during slaughter, and during transport (Collins and Wall 2004) .",

The frequency of leptospira transmission from rodents to humans has been shown to increase during events in Latin America, Bangladesh, and India following heavy rains and flooding (Lau et al. 2010) .

Though there is still much debate within the scientific community as to the contribution of antibiotics in farming systems to the rise of antibiotic resistance, the implications on emerging antibiotic resistance in human populations is even less well understood (Barton 2000) . But there is general consensus that farming systems are likely to contribute to the flow of antibiotic residues and resistant microbes in the wider ecosystem and in humans by runoff into water used or consumed by humans, especially in economically poor settings where farming communities exist alongside densely populated human environments with poor sanitation/sewage systems (Abraham 2011; Segura et al. 2009 ). Clearly, cross-sector action is required to mitigate these risks using the example of the connection between antimicrobial resistance in both animal and human sectors provides a key lesson for ensuring interdisciplinary planning is incorporated when designing zoonotic control strategies.",

Application of what has been learned can help shift the paradigm from detection, assessment, and response to prevention at the source. But solid evidence must be available or obtained, assessed for risk, and used. There is a great amount of scientific knowledge about the risk factors of emergence and their mitigation already available from previous investigation and risk assessment. Much more can be obtained from in-depth study of each emergence event as it occurs. Research must also take into account human behavior, and ensure that populations most at risk clearly understand the measures required to reduce or protect behavior that is high risk. Many emergence events occur in well-defined geographical areas involving the poorest communities, so designing interventions and strategies that are cost-effective and sustainable will be imperative.",
