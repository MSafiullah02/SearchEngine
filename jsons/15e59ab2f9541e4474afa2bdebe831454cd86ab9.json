Canine parvovirus (Parvoviridae type 2a and 2b) has a predilection to infect rapidly dividing cells of the gastrointestinal tract, lymphoid tissue, and bone marrow, leading to hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting, marked leukopenia, and immunosuppression. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The rate of lymphoid and intestinal cell turnover appears to be the main factor determining the severity of the disease. Stress factors, in particular parasitic and nonspecific factors (eg, weaning), may predispose dogs to clinical disease by increasing mucosal cell activity. 2, [5] [6] [7] [8] Susceptibility of puppies to viral infection increases as the maternally acquired antibody titer declines to nonprotective levels. Inadequate immunization to parvovirus during the 1st year of life is an additional risk factor for disease. In susceptible canine populations, parvovirus infection most often presents as a severe systemic and even life-threatening illness. 8 It is associated with a survival rate as low as 9% in the absence of treatment, and 64% with treatment. 4 Because peripheral blood leukocyte counts and morphology are relatively stable in health, leukocyte responses can be useful clinically because they may change dramatically in disease. Although leukocyte responses seldom are pathognomonic for a specific disease, they can provide clinical information to establish a list of differential diagnoses, to assess the patient's response to treatment, or to suggest a prognosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 381, "end": 384, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 385, "end": 388, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 389, "end": 392, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 397, "end": 400, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 678, "end": 680, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 681, "end": 684, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 685, "end": 688, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 689, "end": 692, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 693, "end": 696, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1069, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1175, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Several reports of parvoviral-associated leukopenia and its underlying causes have been published over the years, but they have been inconclusive and contradictory.

This is especially true in the panleukopenia seen secondary to CPV infection where monocytopenia followed by a recovering monocyte count precedes the return of neutrophil production.

Monocytemediated killing also was impaired, and in 1 pup this function was completely absent. In this study, more than half of the puppies (survivors and nonsurvivors) had no morphological evidence of monocyte activity (such as cytoplasmic basophilia and vacuolization) during the 3-day evaluation period.

In a study on basal cortisol as a prognostic indicator in CPV enteritis, Schoeman et al 27 found no difference in the mean basal cortisol (MBC) concentrations between survivors and nonsurvivors at admission. But, the survivors showed a marked reduction in MBC at 24 and 48 hours postadmission, whereas the nonsurvivors showed no reduction in MBC concentrations between admission and 48 hours postadmission. This suggests that patients that are critically ill, such as the puppies with CPV that did not survive, have high MBC concentrations that may account for the very low eosinophil counts.
