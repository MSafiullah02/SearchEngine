FIP is currently the leading infectious cause of death in pet cats (Fehr et al., 1997; Pedersen, 1995).Until now, the pathogenesis of the disease was not well understood. In 1982 it was postulated that FIP was an immune-mediated disease (Jacobse-Geelset al., 1982). One manifestation of an immune-mediated disease is the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) frequently observed in experimental infection (Weiss and Scott, 1981). However, ADE does not appear to be widely occurring under field conditions (Addie et al., 1995; Fehr et al., 1996).",

Later, two types of FCoVs were identified, one, which is confined to the digestive tract and does not spread beyond regional lymph nodes. This is the so-called feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). The second, immunologically closely related to FECV, is capable of going systemic by infecting monocytes and macrophages and causing FIP. This latter is the so-called FIPV (Pedersen et al., 1981b; Stoddart et al., 1988; Stoddart and Scott, 1989).",

Moreover, new techniques such as RT\u2013PCR could demonstrate the presence of FCoV in the blood of healthy cats (Addie et al., 1996; Egberink et al., 1995; Fehr et al., 1996; Foley et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Kipar et al., 1999). These observations support the hypothesis that viraemia is not a hallmark of FIP-inducing FCoVs and that a carrier state exists where cats remain healthy despite being systemically infected. Persistently infected, healthy cats are believed to play the most important epidemiological role in FIP, because they represent a constant source of infection by shedding FCoV in their faeces (Foley et al., 1997).",

The type I virus group represents the genuine FCoVs; they grow poorly in cell culture. Type II viruses, however, arise from recombinations between feline and canine (CCV) coronavirus(Herrewegh et al., 1998). These proliferate well in cell culture and are widely used for the study of FCoV infection. However, in the field, serotype II accounts for only 20 to 30% of all FCoV infections at least in Japan (Hohdatsu et al., 1992). In a recent study conducted in Austria, type I was found to be present in 62% of the cats studied (Posch et al., 2001).",

The animals of group 1 and 3 did not shed any virus during the first 14 days after infection. The cats of group 2 were sacrificed 14 days p.i., whereas those of group 1 and group 3 were re-infected on day 14 under the same conditions as in the first inoculation. To determine whether lack of infection was a hallmark of the FCoV strain used or whether it depended of the infectious dose, group 1 was re-infected with a different FCoV strain (FCoVZu2), whereas group 3 was re-infected with the same isolate as the first time (FCoVZu3) (Table 1). All four cats then started shedding FCoV in their faeces from day 2 after re-infection on. FCoV RNA was detected in whole blood in two cats (3154B and 3139B) on days 14 and 21 p.i., in cat 3132B on day 7 p.i. and in cat 3138B on day 21 p.i. FCoV RNA was found in the plasma fraction of cat 3132B on day 14 p.i. Cat 3138B was the only animal that seroconverted (day 28 p.i.). The results are compiled in Table 2\n.",

In kittens of groups 1 and 3 (infection experiment I) that had received a lower FCoV dose (\u2a7d105FCoV RNA copies), shedding did not start until 2 to 3 days after re-infection witha second low-dose inoculum. From these observations it is concluded that shedding is somehow dependent on the force of infection, i.e. there seems to be a threshold dose of virus that allows the infection to manifest.

Additionally, almost every parenchymal organ was shown to contain FCoV. Considering all animals together, the most frequently affected organs were: colon, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, ileum, jejunum, kidney and spleen. Four kittens tested positive in the brain, although no clinical signs of CNS involvement were observed. This can be explained by the presence of FCoV-infected monocytes in the tissue vasculature althoughinflammatory processes were absent (Kipar et al., 2003).",

All these animals seroconverted and most developed circulating FCoV-specific immune complexes, supporting the fact that the occurrence of FCoV immune complexes is not restricted to the development of FIP (Kipar et al., 1999). In seven out of the eight cats examined, FCoV shedding was demonstrated at the time of necropsy. This confirms previous findings that healthy infected cats are frequently shedding virus (Foley et al., 1997; Harpold et al., 1999). Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between shedding frequency and FCoV antibody titre (Gut, 1999). Accordingly, we concluded that the high FCoV antibody titres observed in all eight animals represent a high FCoV load in all these cats (Gut, 1999).",

These findings are in accordance with other studies, which showed that FCoV-infected, healthy cats can maintain monocyte-associated viraemia for at least 12 months (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998). They differ from the results obtained from our experimentally infected cats where FCoV-RNA was only detected in the monocytes of one animal. However, this is likely due to the lower sensitivity of the FCoV RT-PCR, performed on RNA directly isolated from peripheral blood monocytes. In comparison, monocytes of naturally infected cats in this study as well of naturally infected cats in a previous study had been cultivated prior to FCoV RT-PCR (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998).",

Originally, Pedersen and co-workers postulated that the apathogenic FCoV (designated FECV) remained restricted to the intestinal tract and that systemic infection would coincide with the development of FIP (Pedersen et al., 1981b). However, our observations support the hypothesis that the key event triggering the development of FIP is not associated with the capability of an FCoV to cause viraemia and systemic infection. Although the observation period was not sufficiently long to see animals developing FIP, and we did not sequence the virus to detect mutations, these observations support the concept that FCoV mutants with increased virulence arise during replication (Kennedy et al., 2001; Vennema et al., 1998). To further substantiate this hypothesis it would be important to determine if FCoV is replicating in the blood. A recently developed method to determine FCoV messenger RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells could address this question (Simons et al., 2002).",
