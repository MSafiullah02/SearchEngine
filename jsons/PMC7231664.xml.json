In 2003, NYGH was directly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and built an assessment zone using our ambulance bay.2 A similar approach has been undertaken now. Our clinical coordinator adapted the existing blueprints (Figure 1), mapped out the physical space, and sought in situ feedback from frontline staff. It was constructed over 33 hours and fully functional 30 minutes after opening.\n",
