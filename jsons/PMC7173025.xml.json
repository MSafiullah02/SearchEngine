            "text": "There have been well-documented reports of both influenza A and B outbreaks on cruise ships sailing [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. These infections tend to have a high attack rate with a large number of individuals being infected before the epidemic is contained. These outbreaks can occur even in summertime, in regions where influenza is not in seasonal circulation. Either the passengers or the crewmembers can introduce the organism into the cruise ship population. It is recommended that passengers at high risk for complications of influenza (eg, persons aged \u226550 years, immunocompromised persons, and persons with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems) who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the preceding fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before travel (1) with large organized tourist groups at any time of year; (2) to the tropics; or (3) to the Southern Hemisphere from April through September (the time of increased influenza activity in that hemisphere) [9]. It is also recommended that cruise lines should attempt to achieve at least an 80% vaccination rate among crew members on each ship each year [10]. These recommendations may be modified if the next pandemic influenza outbreak occurs initially outside the United States, to limit the potential of cruise ships to import the pathogenic organism to the United States. The other respiratory viruses that have caused outbreaks among cruise ships include cases of rubella, although the list is probably underrepresented [11]. A study of the epidemiology of injuries and illnesses among passengers on cruise ships revealed that respiratory tract infections were the most common cause of seeking medical attention by passengers and the crew members aboard the ship [12].",

There have been over 50 different incidents of legionnaires' diseases associated with cruise ships [1], [13]. The largest confirmed cluster involved 50 cases spread over nine different cruises in a single ship [14]. The factors involved in these outbreaks often involve contamination of the ship's water supply, the spas or pools, or its air-conditioning system. The prevention of Legionella infections on cruise ships involves treatment of contaminated water by using proper disinfection and filtration and properly cleaning and disinfecting spas and other devices that can disseminate the bacteria [15]. There have also been reported cases of vaccine-preventable infections, such as diphtheria and rubella, acquired on cruise ships [10], [16]. The presence of individuals, especially crew members and passengers from different countries, with differing immunization status can lead to transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and rubella, on cruise ships. It is of utmost importance that before a cruise, passengers update their immunization status and get appropriate vaccination.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vessel Sanitation Program Web site lists over 100 outbreaks of gastroenteritis since then, suggesting that this is a continuing problem [17]. The semiconfined setting of the ships with common source of food and water easily lends itself to outbreaks of diarrheal diseases. The presentation of the illness often involves sudden onset of diarrhea with persistent loose bowel movements accompanied with vomiting. There may be associated symptoms of abdominal cramps, headache, myalgia, or fever. The patients may also complain of tenesmus or blood with their bowel movements, suggesting dysentery.",

            "text": "Most outbreaks of gastroenteritis acquired on cruise ships are caused by Noroviruses, formerly known as Norwalk-like virus. This group of viruses is notorious for causing diarrheal diseases in closed settings, such as in nursing homes [18]. There have been multiple outbreaks of these infections on multiple cruise ships over the past years [1], [17], [19]. These infections are often facilitated by the close living quarters, common food supplies, and intermingling of individuals that occur on cruise ships. Several routes including fecal-oral transmission, aerosolization while vomiting, food and water as vehicles, and environmental contamination by symptomatic patients or asymptomatic carriers can spread these viruses [13]. The reports in the literature have implicated water supplies, various food items, poor food handling techniques, along with person-to-person spread as methods of transmission of the virus to passengers on cruise ships [1]. The incubation period for noroviral gastroenteritis in humans is usually less than 2 days, although cases can occur within 12 hours after exposure. It presents as acute-onset vomiting, watery nonbloody diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. Children tend also to have vomiting more commonly but high-grade fever is usually not a feature of this condition and should suggest an alternative etiology. This is a self-limiting condition and usually only requires medical attention for dehydration. The widespread use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques has led to an improvement in the diagnosis of this infection and an increased appreciation of the role of this virus in causing widespread epidemics of diarrhea on cruise ships [19]. The control of an outbreak is often very difficult and should involve aggressive infection control with active disinfection, isolation of sick individuals, and strict hand washing techniques with training of food handlers.",

These infections often tend to be more severe than those caused by Noroviruses, and have led to sporadic deaths in cruise ship passengers. The parasitic causes of diarrhea reported on cruise ships include Cyclospora species, which were implicated in a large outbreak on a cruise ship where the passengers may have acquired the infection from eating raspberries [27]. There have been sporadic outbreaks of diarrhea on ships caused by Cryptosporidium species and Trichenella spiralis\n[1], [28]. Most of these outbreaks involve a breakdown of the food and water sanitation chain. The factors implicated in various studies include use of contaminated food or water, inadequate food storage, cross-contamination of food, or infected food handlers [1]. The prevention of gastrointestinal infections on cruise ships involves controlling potential deficiencies in food and water handling as well as in cooking and catering, preventing sewage contamination of the water supply, and isolation of sick persons. In the absence of effective vaccines for the prevention of infections by most of the previously mentioned organisms, with the exception of S typhi, these efforts are the primary preventive methods to decrease the burden of gastrointestinal illnesses on cruise ships.",

The proximity of individuals in this setting can lead to infections by a vast array of organisms, especially those transmitted by the aerosol route. The most commonly reported and feared infection is caused by Neisseria meningitidis. In the 1990s, the death of students across various college campuses from meningococcal meningitis made national headlines [59]. The presence of a single case on campus is often followed by widespread media attention and panic [60].",

Those asymptomatic students who become carriers develop protective immunity, leading to lower risk of the disease in subsequent college years. The presentation of these infections can range from a meningitis picture to fulminant meningococcemia with septic shock. This has led to recommendations for college freshman to consider being immunized against meningococcal infections [62].",

These infections present with upper respiratory signs and can range from very mild disease to severe pneumonia. There have also been numerous outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in dormitories including mumps and measles [64], [65]. Other pathogens that have a higher risk of spreading in the dormitories include varicella and rubella viruses. A significant number of these outbreaks can, and have, originated from students who have had none or incomplete vaccinations. The use of vaccines against these pathogens should be vigorously encouraged to minimize the spread of these diseases in college dormitories. The American College Health Association currently recommends the following immunizations as part of the prematriculation immunization requirement for college students: measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and the human papilloma virus [66].",
