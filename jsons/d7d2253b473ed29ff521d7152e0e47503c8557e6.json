The high risks in these countries reflect a combination of country characteristics: densely populated urban areas, high rates of self-employment with no sick pay, poor community hygiene and sanitation, and weak health systems. 2 These health systems lack adequate surveillance and laboratory capacity 3 and a sufficient supply of appropriately trained health workers, and have utterly insufficient critical care capacity to address the upsurge in severe COVID-19 cases 4 -challenges that also severely hampered the response to Ebola outbreaks. 5, 6 While dealing with this surge in cases, it is essential that the health systems themselves do not become a vehicle for transmission to patients or front-line health workers.",

            "text": "It is thought that the two main routes of transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, are through respiratory droplets and through contact. When someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 coughs or exhales, they produce infective respiratory droplets that can be inhaled by anyone close to them. In addition, droplets landing on nearby surfaces can be a source of contact transmission via the hands to the nose, mouth, and eyes. 7 SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on surfaces for 4-72 h, depending on the surface, similar to other human coronaviruses. 8, 9 Therefore, appropriate infection prevention and control in health facilities is crucial, particularly given asymp tomatic transmission 10, 11 and the possible increase in treatment seeking as morbidity increases. Whereas in many high-income countries the advice has been not to visit a health facility if you have fever or cough, in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), this advice might be much less appropriate given the high prevalence of other potentially serious diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria, pneumonia, HIV, and tuberculosis. Moreover, it is uncertain how well such advice would be heeded or enforced. In the context of poor infection prevention and control practices, the use of outpatient services by people with COVID-19 could lead to high rates of infection in health workers, and could fuel health-care-associated infections, which are already prevalent in LMIC settings. 12 WHO recently issued an urgent interim guidance document on water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management for COVID-19, stressing the importance of these practices in health-care settings. 7 The guidance encouraged frequent and proper hand hygiene as one of the most important measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and emphasised regular cleaning and disinfection practices, and safe management of healthcare waste and excreta. This guidance builds on and further underscores existing standard infection prevention and control guidelines for health facilities. 13, 14 We assessed compliance with infection prevention and control practices in outpatient settings, drawing on a secondary analysis of data from 220 health facilities, originally collected in 2018 to evaluate the effectiveness of a quality-improvement intervention in 18 of the 22 regions of mainland Tanzania. Among all the infection prevention and control practices measured, we focused on those most relevant for COVID-19 transmission: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management.

Three studies met the inclusion criteria. A study of 945 health facilities in Kenya measured health worker compliance across five domains of infection prevention and control in 2015. It found that compliance was 2\u00b73% for hand hygiene, 41\u00b70% for glove practices, 87\u00b71% for injections and blood samples, 14\u00b77% for reusable equipment, and 5\u00b74% for non-sharp waste segregation.

Although the public sector remains the dominant health-care provider, the private share is sizeable: in 2019, nationally, 13% of providers were private for-profit and 12% were faith-based, while in urban areas the private shares were much higher (52% for-profit and 19% faith-based in the city of Dar es Salaam). 16 Facilities are categorised by level: dispensaries (the lowest level, often staffed by a single clinical officer with 3 years of post-secondary education), health centres (larger facilities with more staff, which might admit some patients), and hospitals (which have inpatient wards and usually have a fully qualified doctor).",

Facilities were recruited from the Northern, Eastern, Central, Southern, and Southern Highlands zones. At the time of recruitment there were 462 APHFTA member facilities and 513 CSSC member facilities in the study zones. We selected a non-random list of 280 potentially eligible facilities for participation. APHFTA and CSSC approached these facilities to confirm eligibility and obtain written informed consent. Of the facilities approached, 43 were found to be ineligible or were unwilling to participate, giving a total of 237 facilities participating in the randomised controlled trial. For the current study, we used data from the endline sample. Using an endline sample from the quality-improvement programme evaluation raises the question of whether these facilities had higher infection prevention and control compliance than would normally be expected. However, compliance was very similar between intervention and control groups at endline, with no significant difference between the two groups (the results of the randomised controlled trial will be reported elsewhere).",

Compliance with injection and blood draw safety was 10 378 (95\u00b72%) of 10 897, and was above 90% in each of the five indications in this domain (appendix p 6). Figure 2 provides a more detailed breakdown of hand hygiene practices. Health workers attempted some hand hygiene in 883 (10\u00b72%) of 8655 instances, but this was non-compliant in 151 (1\u00b77%) instances because it involved only water (no soap or alcohol hand rub). There was non-compliance in an additional 139 (1\u00b76%) instances because hands were dried on clothes or a reused towel after otherwise correct hand hygiene. This left 593 (6\u00b79%) instances in which health workers complied with hand hygiene practices (450 [5\u00b72%] soap, water, and appropriate hand drying; 143 [1\u00b77%] alcohol rub). We also trained fieldworkers to estimate the duration of hand hygiene with soap and water or hand rub. As it was not possible for them to use a timing device unobtrusively, these estimates are approximate and were not included in the compliance definition in figure 1 . If the compliance definition did require washing or hand rub application for 20 sec or more, hand hygiene compliance fell to 115 (1\u00b73%) instances (figure 2). Table 3 reports odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between compliance in each infection prevention and control domain and the characteristics of facilities and health workers. Facility level and ownership were not significantly associated with compliance in the domains of hand hygiene, glove use, and disinfection of reusable equipment. Faith-based health centres (OR 0\u00b736 [95% CI 0\u00b718-0\u00b772], p=0\u00b70037) and hospitals (0\u00b746 [0\u00b722-0\u00b795], p=0\u00b7037) were less likely to comply with waste management practices than for-profit dispensaries after adjusting for other facility and health worker characteristics and indications. Further analysis suggested that the lack of matching coloured bags for waste bins drove this particular association (appendix p 13). Facility location was not associated with com pliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains.",

            "text": "Compliance with infection prevention and control practices is essential for minimising transmission of infection and is particularly crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using secondary data from a 2018 study, we found that, under typical circumstances in Tanzanian outpatient facilities, infection prevention and control compliance was inadequate. Of primary concern was inadequate hand hygiene, which WHO has cited as crucial for COVID-19 containment, and for which overall compliance was only 6\u00b79%. Hand hygiene was particularly rarely practised when gloves were used, indicating that there was little understanding that contamination of hands could take place despite the use of gloves. 21 Compliance was also extremely low for disinfection of reusable equipment-only 13% of thermometers and less than 1% of stethoscopes, items both likely to be very widely used for patients with COVID-19 symptoms, were disinfected between patients. Performance on manage ment of (non-sharp) waste was also below 20%, which could mean that additional infection opportunities arise if hazardous waste materials are subsequently not disposed of appropriately. One might expect that infection prevention and control compliance will increase com pared with these findings from 2018 as awareness of COVID-19 grows among health workers and com munication campaigns are launched. However, it is also possible that compliance will worsen as facilities see far greater patient volumes, leading to greater pressure on health worker time and supplies needed for the prevention and control of infection. The data were collected from 220 faith-based and private for-profit facilities, with variable sizes, locations, and staff mixes. However, compliance with infection prevention and control practices varied very little by facility characteristics. Compliance patterns were similar across facility level, ownership type, and location, indicating that these practices appear to be ingrained as behavioural norms within the health system. There was some evidence that compliance varied by health worker characteristics. Most notably, older health workers were less likely to use gloves correctly, female health workers were better at hand hygiene, and nurses and midwives performed substantially better than more qualified providers in most of the infection prevention and control domains. From a policy perspective, these data indicate what types of health worker could be prioritised in the design and targeting of infection prevention and control interventions. Given that hospitals in our sample typically served three to four times more outpatients than health centres and dispensaries did, policy makers should also consider targeting high-volume health facilities first to maximise the number of patients benefiting initially.",

            "text": "No publicly owned facilities were included in the study. The most recent Service Provision Assessment in Tanzania (2014-15) found that infrastructure and supplies for infection control were often poorer in public facilities than in private facilities. 22 For example, supplies for hand hygiene (soap and running water or alcoholbased hand disinfectant) were available in 90% of faithbased facilities, 82% of private for-profit facilities, and only 58% of government facilities. Together with the lack of variation in compliance across facilities, this leads us to expect that public sector compliance is unlikely to be higher than the rates observed in this study. This expectation is further supported by the fact that infection prevention and control compliance in our study was slightly but consistently higher than a comparable study of outpatient care in Kenya (appendix p 3), which included public, faith-based, and for-profit facilities, and found a weak negative association between public ownership and compliance. 18 One might expect infection prevention and control compliance to be higher in inpatient settings where perceived infection risk could be higher. Studies of labour wards have shown substantial variation, with somewhat higher hand hygiene compliance in some settings (eg, 9\u00b76% in Zanzibar) 23 but lower in others (eg, 0\u00b76% preintervention in India). 24 In fact, non-compliance with hand hygiene has been described as a universal problem, with a 2009 systematic review in industrialised country hospitals (mainly intensive care units) reporting a median compliance rate of 40%, 25 and much lower rates in highincome outpatient settings. 26 This study had a number of limitations. First, because the data were originally collected for a different purpose before the pandemic, we did not measure certain supplies or behaviours crucial for the control of COVID-19, such as the wearing of personal protective equipment required to manage suspected COVID-19 patients. Second, we do not claim that our estimates are representative of private facilities in Tanzania. The sample did not include facilities in certain regions, private for-profit hospitals, or any tertiary hospitals. Moreover, we did not select a random sample among those eligible to participate. However, the lack of variation in compliance by facility level, ownership, and location gives us reason to expect a similar pattern of results elsewhere in the country. Third, by observing infection prevention and control compliance, we might have changed provider behaviour through the Hawthorne effect. However, this measurement method is likely to be more reliable than self-reports of behaviour, and our analysis of the order number of patients observed provided no strong evidence of a Hawthorne effect, although it has been noted in other studies. 20 Fourth, we used endline data from a randomised controlled trial of a quality-improvement programme. As noted above, there was no evidence of a difference in infection prevention and control compliance between intervention and control facilities, but structural quality was assessed in both study groups at baseline by study partners, and it is possible that this could have raised awareness of infection prevention and control requirements. If awareness had been raised, it would imply that the inadequate infection prevention and control compliance observed should be considered a maximum. Fifth, we did not measure itemspecific availability of infrastructure and supplies needed for infection prevention and control.",

First, inadequate infection prevention and control will make health workers more likely to contract COVID-19 from their patients. Several small studies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, caused by another coronavirus, reported attack rates for SARS among health workers ranging from 1\u00b72% to 57\u00b71%. 27, 28 These same health workers will be needed as front-line staff to deal with seriously ill patients as cases mount, so having significant numbers of health workers sick or self-isolating could threaten the operation of the health system at a crucial time. Second, inadequate infection prevention and control could put patients and caregivers at risk of contracting COVID-19 when they visit a health facility for another complaint. Although data on health-care-associated infections are poorly recorded in LMICs, the available evidence indicates that they are relatively common in LMIC health systems (where 15\u00b75 patients per 100 acquire an infection, compared with 7\u00b71 per 100 in Europe). 12 Any such healthcare-acquired infection should be avoided, but this is particularly important for COVID-19, as the case fatality rate is significantly higher for those with pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), who might be more likely to be visiting health facilities.",

There is consensus that interventions must be based on an analysis of the causes of poor infection prevention and control in specific contexts, and that successful interventions are generally multi faceted. 29 A systematic review of the WHO-5 hand hygiene campaign-consisting of five components, namely system change, training and education, observation and feedback, reminders, and a safety climate-found it to be effective in improving hand hygiene in hospitals, and found that compliance was further improved by adding behavioural interventions such as goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability. 30 This review focused only on hand hygiene, and included studies were predominantly from intensive care units or other inpatient settings, with the vast majority in high-income countries. In weaker health systems, the availability of supplies is likely to be an important bottleneck. A recent WHO-UNICEF report on water, sanitation, and hygiene in health care reported that only 74% of facilities globally had basic water services (51% in sub-Saharan Africa), and 16% of facilities had no hygiene service (ie, no hand hygiene facilities at points of care and soap and water near toilets). 31 During outbreaks, when patient numbers are likely to substantially increase, maintaining supplies will be particularly important.",

We estimate that for 1000 outpatients (the mean per month in sampled facilities was 861), the supplies needed for hand hygiene, disinfection, and waste management cost approximately US$60 in Tanzania based on current prices (assuming 4000 hand hygiene indications requiring 4 L hand soap and 4000 paper towels, 1500 gloves, 620 disinfections requiring 0\u00b712 L disinfectant, and 50 waste bags). However, prices are rising rapidly because of increased demand during COVID-19, especially for hand rub, which is unlikely to be available in sufficient quantities on the open market. WHO recommends two formulations for local production of hand rub, but countries will need support to do this on a large scale, with proper quality assessment. 14 To these supply costs, one would need to add costs for resources for additional training and behaviour-change activities to support implementation. Moreover, infection prevention and control for COVID-19 will require many more actions than those assessed here, particularly for inpatient care. For example, WHO COVID-19 guidelines 7 require cleaning and disinfection of toilets at least twice daily by a trained cleaner wearing personal protective equipment (gown, gloves, boots, mask, and a face shield or goggles); once daily cleaning of all environments in which patients with COVID-19 receive care, as well as cleaning when a patient is discharged; and wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment by all individuals dealing with soiled bedding, towels, and clothes from patients with COVID-19, including heavyduty gloves, a mask, eye protection (goggles or a face shield), a long-sleeved gown or apron, and boots or closed shoes. 7 The extremely inadequate availability of personal protective equipment in these health systems represents a major threat.",
