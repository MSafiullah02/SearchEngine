However, CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine asks cruise ships to report outbreaks of influenza-like illness (ILI) and to complete end-of-voyage cumulative ILI reports. Ships voluntarily report the total number of crew members and passengers with ILI either electronically or by phone to the CDC Quarantine Station with jurisdiction over the port of call. If a ship\u2019s ILI incidence rate exceeds the CDC-defined outbreak threshold of 1.380 cases per 1000 traveller days,6 CDC requests enhanced data collection and, in coordination with the state health department, provides consultation on influenza testing. If influenza viruses are detected in crew members or passengers, recommendations are made regarding control measures, including antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis, isolation of ill individuals, monitoring of exposed individuals, and vaccination of crew members.",

The value of cruise ship influenza surveillance is highlighted by outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza among passengers and crews,2,7\u20139 and the potential for introduction of antigenically drifted seasonal influenza virus strains.3 For example, in 1997, an antigenically drifted H3N2 virus strain identified in ill Australian cruise ship passengers became the predominant virus during the subsequent 1997\u20131998 influenza season in North America.10",

Integration of syndromic and virologic surveillance could improve the ability to detect and characterize influenza virus strains and other respiratory viruses circulating among cruise ship travellers. From May through September, 2013\u20132015, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL), CDC Influenza Division, CDC Anchorage Quarantine Station and two cruise lines initiated a pilot laboratory-based surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on a few cruise ships in Alaska. The pilot project aimed to characterize respiratory viruses circulating among cruise ship travellers in the state, to correlate the timing of cruise ship ILI incidence peaks with identification of respiratory viruses in Alaska, and to compare influenza viruses identified in ill passengers and crew members on ships with influenza viruses identified at land-based influenza surveillance sites.",

Four ships from two cruise lines participated in 2013 and 2014, and two additional ships from the same cruise lines were added for a total of six ships in 2015. The ships were relatively representative of those sailing in the region during the time period of the pilot project; ~2000\u20132500 passengers, and 750\u20131000 crew were on board each ship. Participating ships had voyage lengths varying from 7 to 14 days. Throughout the season, ASVL provided specimen-collection kits to cruise ships, including nasopharyngeal swabs, universal transport medium, laboratory submission slips and packaging for shipping specimens. The case definition for inclusion in year 1 (2013) was ILI (temperature of \u2265100\u00b0F and either cough or sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza); in years 2 and 3 (2014 and 2015), the definition was expanded to include signs of an acute respiratory illness (ARI) without fever, if the clinician suspected an infectious aetiology. Ship staff obtained verbal consent from the individual (if an adult) or permission of a parent or guardian (for those under 18 years old). Each participating ship was asked to collect 2\u20133 specimens per week during the course of the pilot project. CDC approved the surveillance project with a determination that it did not meet the definition of human subjects research under 45 Code of Federal Regulations part 46.",

As southbound voyages originating in Alaska had peak onset dates on the day before the start of the voyage, most influenza virus transmission may have occurred before embarkation. Southbound voyages are generally associated with land-based tours immediately preceding the voyage involving buses and trains, which are additional semi-closed and close-contact environments that can potentially facilitate the transmission of influenza viruses. Conversely, northbound voyages (which often have their land-based tours post-voyage) had peak onset dates occurring mid-voyage, suggesting that most influenza virus transmission occurred on board.

The results are also not generalizable to the entire cruise ship, as only ill individuals visited the ship medical centre for testing. As such, no true attack rate for influenza can be established. Inclusion of only individuals reporting to the infirmary with respiratory illness may have biased selection of passengers and crew members to those with more severe symptoms or those more likely to seek healthcare. Clinicians on participating ships were limited to collecting 2\u20133 specimens per week on average; thus, they may have chosen more overtly ill individuals to test. Additionally, the case definition for participant inclusion changed between years 1 (2013) and 2 (2014). Influenza vaccination history was obtained by self-report and may have been subject to recall bias, and the length of time between self-reported vaccination and illness onset was largely unknown. Operational issues with specimen storage and shipping resulted in ~10% (45/455, Table 1) being lost in transport or deemed unsuitable for testing at the laboratory, and delays in shipping some specimens may have caused some falsely negative results.",
