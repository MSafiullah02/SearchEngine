            "text": "Efficiently operated High-speed railways (HSRs) offer advantages in punctual departure/arrival time, comfortable travel experience, and less CO2 emission in comparison to air travel (Givoni, 2007; Hall, 2009). The first HSR corridor was inaugurated in Japan in 1964. Then the first European HSR, TGV Sud-Est, between Paris and Lyon was opened in 1981 in France. Thereafter, many HSR lines have been constructed in other Western European countries, including ICE in Germany and AGV in Spain (Givoni, 2006). Although inaugurated in a later stage, Chinese HSR networks have expanded at an exponential growth rate because of a substantial financial support from the central government. Especially after 2008, a 4 trillion RMB stimulus package to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis has more than doubled the investment capital for HSR construction (Amos, Bullock, & Sondhi, 2010). From the end of 2003, when the first HSR between Shenyang and Qinhuangdao was opened, until 2015, the Chinese HSR networks increased to 19,000 km, accounting for more than 60% of global HSR networks. Chinese HSR networks were constructed in only 12 years, and on a scale larger than in the rest of the world. Regarding the fast development of HSR networks in China, a large volume of literature has reported the impacts of HSR services on local and regional economy (Chen & Haynes, 2017; Ke, Chen, Hong, & Hsiao, 2017), urban specialization pattern (Lin, 2016) and urban service industry agglomeration (Shuai, Tian, & Yang, 2017). However, the focus on the interaction between HSR and air travel is still limited in the context of China.",

            "text": "Different from the European HSR networks, which were developed in a relative mature aviation market with modest growth rates, the development of Chinese HSR networks parallels a fast-growing and partially deregulated aviation market (Wang et al., 2016). After two decades of air deregulation in China, China's air transportation has experienced rapid growth, especially from the start of the economic reform in 1980s due to the rapid increase in air travel demand (Wang et al., 2016). Between 1997 and 2015, domestic air passenger traffic in China grew from 5.6 million passengers to 436 million. The annual airline growth rate was almost 10%, particularly after 2000. However, the annual growth rate of air travel is prone to be affected by unexpected social events, such as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the 2008 financial crisis. In addition, after HSR operations started, first the D train services with an average operational speed 200 km/h in 2007 and then G train services with an average operational speed of 300 km/h in 2009, the airline's annual growth began to drop progressively to reach stable growth after 2012 when there were remaining regulation, limited investment, and poor overall national policy on the aviation industry. Fig. 1\nshows that China's aviation market has been in a stage of fast growth in parallel to the expansion of HSR networks. While the volume of both air and HSR traffic increased between 2010 and 2015, HSR did so at a higher growth rate. This reflects the potential competition that HSR services offer for passenger transportation in China. Apart from unexpected socio-economic events, the operation of HSR services has absorbed the demand growth for airline travel to a certain extent. In addition, HSR network expansion triggered loosening of regulations on airlines by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), such as partially flexibile air fares and more operator licenses for private and low cost airline companies (Zhang, Yang, Wang, & Zhang, 2014).",

In contrast, very often a lot of ex-post studies such as reports, white papers conducted or commissioned by transportation companies are unavailable to the public due to due to the confidentiality of the operational data from the transportation companies (Dobruszkes, Dehon, & Givoni, 2014; Li & Loo, 2016). Ex-post research is further relatively limited in academia, especially in China with a strong governmental control on the railway and aviation industry and the application of relevant HSR geo-economic and transportation variables is rather crude in the data and model application.",

Firstly, using a balanced panel data set collected for 270 cross-sections over seven years, we examine the relationship between HSR services and air passenger demand using variance component models. The analysis takes into account city pairs with and without HSR-air competition over the period 2007\u20132013 to understand the impact of geo-economic HSR variables (such as HSR entry and duration of operating HSR services) on air travel demand. Secondly, we employ within-between models (Bell & Jones, 2015; Nieuwenhuis, Hooimeijer, van Ham, & Meeus, 2016), using an unbalanced dataset containing only 138 city pairs with HSR-air competition from 2007 to 2013, to specify how HSR transportation variables are specifically interacted with the air travel demand in the two geographic (temporal and spatial) dimensions. We do so because the transportation variables, such as frequency, travel time, and fare, vary both in terms of the duration of operation of the HSR services (temporal dimension) and between different HSR routes (spatial dimension). Previous research has focused mainly on one of the dimensions.",

Research has confirmed that after the opening of new HSR services, the HSR will have substitution effects on air travel by means of diverting original air passenger flows into the HSR. The first study is from Jani\u0107 (1993), who claimed that HSR transportation in Europe competes with air transportation over a relatively large range of distances, between 400 and 2000 km. A broad range of ex-ante academic literature then emerged, focusing on the impacts of HSR on predicted demand for airline travel in different contexts. In France, Haynes (1997) found that after a few years of HSR operation, air traffic dropped by 50% between Paris and Lyon. In Spain, Gonz\u00e1lez-Savignat (2004), based on a stated preference experimental design, predicted the HSR's impacts on the reduced market share of airlines (50%) between Madrid and Barcelona. In Korea, Park and Ha (2006), relying on the stated preference model calibration, examined the effects of HSR on domestic air transportation demand in Korea and estimated a demand reduction between 34% and 75% between Seoul and Daegu. In Germany, to describe the consumer selection behavior between HSR and airlines, Ivaldi and Vibes (2005) used a theoretical simulation model to analyze the intermodal competition in the Cologne-Berlin route, finding that the entry of HSR reduces the fares and the airline flight frequency.",

The advantage of ex-post research is the accuracy of reflecting the actual effect of intermodal competition rather than the relatively poor performance of prediction embedded in ex-ante research (Givoni & Dobruszkes, 2013). Dobruszkes (2011) and Fu, Zhang, and Lei (2012) used aggregated data and observed impacts of HSR-air competition in Europe and China, but did not implement econometric analysis on a large set of routes. That type of observed ex-post research has raised the issues of the unclear causal relationship of HSR-relevant factors and the lack of representativeness. Recently, studies have used econometric analysis to overcome this deficiency by focusing on the cases of Europe and China (Albalate, Bel, & Fageda, 2015; Chen, 2017; Fu, Lei, Wang, & Yan, 2015). However, the indicators for the HSR are dummy variables. These are unable to accurately reflect the influence of HSR related to geographic transportation factors such as travel time, frequency, and ticket fare. Other researchers have used transportation variables of HSR such as travel time, the frequency of trains (Clewlow, Sussman, & Balakrishnan, 2014; Dobruszkes et al., 2014; Zhang, Yang, & Wang, 2017) and the length of railway networks (Li & Loo, 2016) to specify the influence of HSR on airlines using either time series (temporal dimension) or cross-section (spatial dimension) analysis.",

This means that the variations in transportation variables in the other geographic dimension are not taken into account simultaneously (Table 1\n). Hence, our first hypothesis is that the influence of the transportation variables varying in the temporal dimension differs from those varying in the spatial dimension. Our panel data set allows for including both dimensions in the analysis. Second, we hypothesize that the entry of HSR services with respect to the growth rate of air travel demand may not be as significant as in Europe until a certain year of operating HSR services. The fast economic growth in Chinese cities and the increasing purchasing power of urban citizens have resulted in a fast-growing potential market for both air travel and HSR travel in China. Although some air passengers divert to HSR, there still exists a high demand for air travel even after opening new HSR services.",

We tested the summed and multiplied GDP per capita and population for the two ends of each city pair, respectively. The multiplied formats of those socio-economic variables yield the greatest explanatory power when incorporated. Furthermore, the impacts of HSR entry on the demand for air travel has different short-term and longer-term impacts (Givoni & Dobruszkes, 2013). To isolate these temporal changes in the relationships between HSR and airlines in China, in addition to the dummy variable of the entry of HSR services, the duration of operating HSR services should be considered as a core determinant to reflect how the airline passenger flow generally changes from before to after the presence of HSR services. With regard to the fast development of Chinese HSR networks in parallel with the fast growth of the aviation market in China, the competitive effects of HSR on air travel may not be high enough just after HSR entry on city pair markets that still have a high demand for air travel. In other words, the interaction between the duration of operating HSR services and air passenger travel may be non-linear. Hence, we included a quadratic term of duration in the model. Furthermore, events such as the global financial crisis of 2008 influence air travel (Wang, Bonilla, & Banister, 2016), which means that the year dummy variables need to be considered for controlling unexpected influences on the air travel demand.",

Furthermore, ticket price for HSR and air transportation (Gonz\u00e1lez-Savignat, 2004) and the frequency of HST (Dobruszkes et al., 2014; Gonz\u00e1lez-Savignat, 2004; Pels, Nijkamp, & Rietveld, 2000; Raturi, Srinivasan, Narulkar, Chandrashekharaiah, & Gupta, 2013) are crucial variables as well. Also, the spatial layout of cities and the locations of HSR stations and airports influence the access time to get to/from the HSR station or airport (Adler, Pels, & Nash, 2010; Behrens & Pels, 2012). It could be expected that the spatial scale of China is largely different from that of other HSR countries. We still can expect those transportation-related variables mentioned above are still applicable in the context of China (Zhang et al., 2017). Moreover, in China, most HSR stations are located in suburbs. Therefore, the access and egress time to and from stations is longer compared to European cases. To some extent, total travel time, instead of line haul time, from origin to destination actually decides the modal choice for intercity travel. Therefore, whether the location of terminals (stations and airports) influences the intermodal competition between HSR and airlines needs to be tested. The HSR transportation variables have been collected for each city pair, both for G and D trains.",

In this analysis, we replace the two general HSR variables with the specific HSR transportation variables i.e. travel time, frequency and ticket fare. For this panel data set, only the city pairs where direct HSR services still compete with air services between 2007 and 2013 are considered. Provided by the characteristics of unbalanced panel data and two geographic variations in HSR transportation variables, we employ a hybrid random effects model, also called a between-within (BW) model, to interpret the results in two geographic dimensions (Bell & Jones, 2015; Bell, Fairbrother, & Jones, 2016, pp. 1\u201338). The BW model is called a hybrid model because it combines the advantages of both fixed and random effects models and have been implemented in the panel data studies (Bell, Johnston, & Jones, 2015; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2016) to separate the variations of independent variables into two levels. It can be written as:(2)Yit=\u03b20+\u03b21(Xit\u2212X\u00afi)+\u03b23X\u00afi+\u03b22Zi+(Ui+\u03b5ij)where \u03b21 is the within effect and \u03b23 is the between effect of a series of time-variant variables xit (Bell & Jones, 2015). Rather than assuming heterogeneity away with the FE, the BW method estimates how the effects of within and between city pair variations in independent variables vary over time and space on the dependent variable. Any time-invariant characteristics (both observed and unobserved) are automatically controlled for, as the sum of their change will always be zero. Therefore, the estimations for time-varying variables in BW models are identical to the estimations in FE models. Additionally, a BW model includes random effects and allows for the inclusion of time-invariant variables \u03b22, providing additional information on differences between city pairs that could not be estimated using a fixed effects model (for a more detailed description of the method, see Bell & Jones, 2015).",

Therefore, we aim to delve into how the elasticity of temporal and spatial transportation variables differs in the two thresholds (600 and 1100 km) for three competitive distance categories (dominant by HSR, shared between HSR and air, dominated by airlines) to shed light on operational and planning strategies for companies.",

After the Hausman test, we reject the null hypothesis at the p = 0.05 significance level that the coefficients estimated by the efficient random effects model are the same as the coefficients of the FE model; thus, the FE model is more appropriate here for the analysis. From the FE model, the presence of HSR services has a negative relationship with the air passenger flows. The entry of HSR services will lead to a 27% (100 \u2217 (EXP (\u22120.3284)\u22121)) decrease in the air travel passengers. Furthermore, the duration of operating HSR services since the moment of HSR entry reflects a lag effect of HSR services on airline passenger flows. The negative coefficients of the duration variables are significant except for the duration variable of one year's operation of HSR services, which means that after two year's operation of HSR services, the airline passenger flows start to decrease more due to the substitution effect from HSR. This is because at the initial stage of HSR development, HSR networks had not yet been formed and travelers' awareness of the HSR alternative was not so high that the substitution between HSR and air was still limited. However, with the gradual and fast extension of HSR networks in China, its substitution effect on air travel demand has been increasing. Moreover, the long-term impact of operating HSR services on air travel is not linear, especially after 6 year's operation of HSR services there is an inversed growth trend compared to the previous years. This indicates that in the long run, the air companies try to adapt their operational strategy to weaken the competitive pressure from the HSR.",

The coefficients of ticket fare and travel time are not significant. This is reasonable because the ticket fare and travel time of HSR services in the temporal dimension for a city pair hardly vary after the start of HSR services. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) instead of the China Railway Corporation (CRC) has the authority to decide the ticket fare for each city pair regarding travel distance. To increase the use of HSRs, the NDRC did not allow the CRC to adjust the HSR ticket fare according to market mechanisms before 2016. Therefore, the ticket fare of HSR services for a city pair after a few years of operation is almost the same as the one at the beginning stage of operation. In addition, with the duration of operating HSR services increasing, similar to the case of ticket fares, the travel time in the temporal dimension cannot be reduced to a large extent without new technology breakthroughs on the operational speed of HSR services. Note that a national speed reduction of HSR services occurred after the accident involving a D train crash in 2011 when the government decided to reduce the operational speeds of both D and G trains. Even though the travel speed of G trains decreased from 350 to 300 km/h and that of D trains from 250 to 200 km/h, the influence of travel time in the temporal dimension is still rather limited.",

The coefficient of the ticket fare of airlines is not significant anymore in this model compared to the previous balanced panel model, which means that facing competition from HSR, the strategy of lowering air ticket fare in the long run will not contribute to the improved competitiveness of airlines.",

Our research confirms that variations of travel time between city pairs in the spatial dimension, instead of variations of travel time within a city pair in the temporal dimension, are important to explain differences in air passenger flows between city pairs. This means that regarding a specific travel speed of HST decreasing the travel time by limiting the intermediate stops between city pairs will be efficient to reduce air travel passengers. Interestingly, a positive relationship exists between the frequency of HSR services and airline travel passengers in the spatial dimension. City pairs with a higher frequency of HSR services tend to have more airline travel passengers. It is likely that the city pairs with a larger frequency of HSR services are normally the ones with higher GDP per capita and population, which creates higher passengers for intercity travel (Dobruszkes et al., 2014). Due to the potential correlation between the frequency of HSR and socio-economic status of city pairs in the spatial dimension, rather than the variations of the frequency of HST in the spatial dimension, the variations of the frequency in the temporal dimension actually influences air travel passengers. In addition, we observe that the coefficient of the HSR ticket fare is not significant as this effect may already have been captured by the travel time variable as a result of the fixed HSR ticket fare mechanism.",

This is reasonable since most HSR stations in China are located in the suburbs of cities, similar to locations of airports. Wang et al.

This is not a significant negative impact, compared with studies such as Albalate et al. (2015) in Spain, who report a more than 50% airline seat reduction after the entry of HSR services. However, after two-years' operation of HSR services in China, the negative impact of HSR services on air passenger flows tends to increase. This reflects the typical case of China that the substitution effect of HSR networks in a fast-growing aviation market (in contrast to the more mature European market) is not significant on the growth of air passenger travel at least at the initial stage until more HSR routes have been opened and the awareness of the new service among travelers grows.",

The frequency component in the temporal dimension indicates that HSR can improve its competitive position with respect to airlines if the HSR frequency on the route is increased. The travel time in the spatial dimension shows that HSR has a better competitive position on city pairs with a shorter HSR travel time, as on these routes airlines have a relatively limited travel time advantage. The frequency in the spatial dimension is just the approximation of the economic level of city pairs reflecting travel passengers. The impact of travel time in the temporal dimension is rather limited even though there has been a travel speed reduction for the HSR services during the period of analysis. In contrast to the findings that HSR ticket fares are elastic with the market share in Europe (Adler et al., 2010; Behrens & Pels, 2012), the ticket fares of HSR in both the temporal and spatial dimensions are not strongly related to the air passenger flows in China, as a result of the fixed HSR ticket fare mechanism in the control of the government. Fare probably can play an important role in competition only when it fluctuates according to the market. Our research further confirms that the short stretch of HSR routes in the spatial dimension and the high frequency of HSR services in the temporal dimension can definitely increase the competitiveness of HSR relative to airlines.",

            "text": "While our research has identified the reaction of airlines to HSR services between 2007 and 2013, we note that from January 2016 the HSR ticket fares were no longer under the control of the NDRC (NDRC, 2015). HSR operators acquired the right to price train seats largely based on market passengers. Thus, future research could investigate how the flexible ticket fare influences the intermodal relationships between HSR and airlines in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. Second, although the aggregate time cost of intra-city trip to/from terminals are not significant in this research, future research could also study whether the individual differences of disaggregate time cost of intra-city trip to/from terminals influence the competitive relationships between HSR and airlines. Third, because long-distance transportation networks evolve over time and shape demand to some extent, it will be of interest to also take into account the recent conditions of both HSR and airline and from the perspectives of the demand side (actual O/D passenger flows) in both HSR and airline sides in the future, especially regarding the expansion of low-cost airline in China after 2013. Moreover, specific schemes of the subsidy for operational companies, air operation, airport and air traffic control, which vary from case to case, could also influence the cooperative relationship between HSR and air travel. A detailed case study research could shed light on that.",
