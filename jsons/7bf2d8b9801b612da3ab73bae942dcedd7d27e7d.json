Resulting 3D models are based on few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge about the biological entity represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we learn statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, spatial properties and distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in 3D model construction. Once all imaging evidence is incorporated in the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, their distances and orientations to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization and modeling feedback loop. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle ultrastructure. Its first complete atomistic model, which we present here, can steer biological research to new promising directions in fighting spread of the virus.",

Cells typically are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane, which encloses several thousand different types of biomolecules that choreograph the processes of finding resources, responding to environmental changes, and ultimately growing and reproducing.

Challenges that are currently limiting the integrative modeling pipeline include (a) finding and curating disparate sources of data, and (b) intuitive 3D construction and visualization of models of this size and complexity within a reasonable user and computational effort.

We model structural characteristics on a small representative collection of structural elements, which are then assembled into the entire cellular or viral system through a set of learned rules that guide placement and interaction of the component elements. These rules are specified directly through 3D interactive modeling, instead of indirectly through some rule-definition syntax. In this way, we can reduce the burden on the users, provide them with an intuitive modeling interface, and automatically generate instances of the full model comprised of a huge number of interactive component elements. In case the model needs to be further fine-tuned or new information needs to be incorporated, the construction rules are revised in 3D and new models are generated that incorporate the latest revision. If structural evidence is available in form of EM images, our system learns basic structural properties from images by few inputs from the user.",

Since late seventies Richards has developed a geometric representation of molecular surface that characterized their area [48] , which as a concept was popularized by Connolly [7] . Over the years many geometric construction algorithms for molecular surfaces have been developed, notably Reduced Surface [49] , blobby objects [4, 44] , or \u03b1-shapes [10] to name a few. These algorithms are typically well parallelizable on multiprocessor systems [56] or on modern GPUs [28, 19, 6] , and nowadays scale up to interactive rates of huge atomistic models thanks to e. g.view-guided rendering strategies [5] . Simplified representations, such as van-der-Waals space filling molecular models can be interactively constructed and visualized to represent up to billion-sized atomistic scenes [32, 12, 26] making use of various acceleration strategies, such as the procedural impostors [54] , adaptive level-of-detail tesselation [29, 37] , or hybrid particle-volumetric representation [50] .",

Halladjian et al. presented an approach to construct and visualize a multi-scale model of interphase chromosomes [18] . A typical approach to model the backbone of linear polymers like RNA or DNA procedurally is to concatenate building blocks with processes like a random walk. A random walk produces a sequence of points where the location of each generated point is dependent on its predecessor. While this process leads to plausible models and is able to incorporate measured characteristics like the stiffness, it is hard to control and guide to specific points. Klein et al. [27] propose a parallel algorithm for constructing a 3D genome sequence, which builds on the midpoint-displacement concept. We utilize this approach in calculating the path for genetic macromolecules.",

Utilization in the sciences can be exemplified through modeling advanced geological concepts and phenomena [30, 38] or for creating quick molecular landscapes for communicating to peers or a broader audience [14] . These works result in approximate sketches of complex scientific scenarios and make use of rules that are algorithmically defined within the system. Our approach also features sketching components, however, the proposed approach is initially rule-free and all rules are specified by the user or determined from imaging data. Moreover, these rules can be defined at a wide range of modeling precision. Our rule design space is open: many simple rules are generated first, then can be combined in a construction of more complex structural elements, and obsolete concepts can be revised into new rules and effortlessly reapplied. The established rules can be stored as structural templates that can be shared among users.",

A packing algorithm then iteratively places the macromolecular building blocks into different compartments of the organism. This compartment is described by a discretized distance volume, which is packed and updated in a sequential manner. Currently, on a desktop workstation, such a packing process takes several minutes up to hours, to pack a representation of the HIV particle 100 nm in diameter. The specification of the recipe, however, is a human-readable textual rule definition that relies on the accurate specification from the user. In our approach, instead, the rules are learned from the user interaction during interactive and intuitive modeling of few structural elements directly in the 3D environment. Such elementary 3D models of nanoscale elements can-in spirit of procedural modeling-be assembled into much larger mesoscale complexes that can be interactively constructed and visualized.",

The major axis of the ellipse is aligned with the main axis of the protein.

These proteins naturally are not exactly on the contour, but they are located close to it within a certain surface band. To characterize this band, an inner contour is specified. The user can easily specify the thickness of this band on which the marked surface proteins are located. With this we have fully characterized the most important aspects of the input microscopy image. Next a distribution of the surface proteins on the membrane band needs to be estimated. For this, we subdivide the band into equally sized surface patches and count the amount of proteins associated with each patch. To characterize the distribution of the proteins from what we see on the membrane contour, we store the per-patch protein counts in a histogram.

Our object should feature the same shape characteristics as observed on the particle's silhouette or cross-section, depending on the imaging method, termed here as the contour. We model the object based on three principal dimensions, d 1 \u2265 d 2 \u2265 d 3 of an ellipsoid and characterize it by two aspect ratios, namely as elongation index EI = d 2 /d 1 and flatness index F I = d 3 /d 2 [55] . EI can be determined from the contour, F I is defined by the user then it is used for determined d 3 . Next, we need to extrude the contour into three dimensions. For this task, we employ the standard contour inflation method from sketch-based modeling [59] . To assign a depth (z) value to all points on the three-dimensional object we proceed as follows. First, we make a binary mask from the contour so that 0.0 is assigned to the outside and 1.0 to the inside of the shape. Then, we apply a cascade of Gaussian filters (with radius 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) on the image mask. After each smoothing pass, the resulting image is multiplied with the original image mask, so that all pixels that are outside the contour are again set to zero. The resulting image is used for assigning the depth values symmetrically on both subspaces partitioned by the contour plane of z = 0 (see Figure 4 bottom left two images for an example). The next step is to create the three-dimensional object represented by a triangular mesh. We create a 3D sphere with approximately equally-sized triangles where the radius is the largest radius from all contour points to the origin O. After that, we project this mesh onto the z = 0 contour plane. This projected mesh is distorted to the shape of the contour. The example 2D mesh backprojected onto the contour plane can be seen in Figure 4 top right. Finally, for each mesh point, we extrude its z-coordinate to inflate the contour. The z-coordinate value of each point of the mesh is calculated as a multiplication of half of d 3 with the corresponding pixel value (with the same x, y coordinates) from the previously calculated depth image in Figure 4 bottom left.",

The size of the patch is determined by the size of the area of segments of the bands from the 2D contour. Afterwards, every patch is associated with one value from the above distribution.

Although this can lead to overlapping of elements, the property can be exploited for example in cases where string-like elements are placed in a plane close to each other. The user can control how close elements can be before creating a collision. Once a new element candidate is generated all leaf octants of the tree intersecting the element's bounding sphere are fetched and used for collision detection. If there is no collision, the element is created. Otherwise, the element is not created.

In this example, an additional 8 instances labeled O were generated recursively (for T num = 3). In the example Figure 8 right, T num is set to one to showcase the random selection of transformations.",

For this purpose, the generator starts at a random point and connects it to a random one in its close proximity until all points are connected. The resulting polyline may have strong kinks. To remove the kinks, a cubic interpolation and subdivision is applied resulting in a smoother polyline. Fiber structures, that we would like to model, are characterized through a persistence length property that expresses the bending stiffness of a fiber.

The N protein has been partially determined with X-ray crystallography (PDBids: 6VYO, 6YI3, 6WJI, 6M3M). As for SARS-CoV-2 M and E protein, none of them have been experimentally resolved yet. In this work, we took advantage of SARS-CoV-2 sequence homology with other betacoronaviruses to perform homology modeling and to obtain structural model for each protein component present in the SARS-CoV-2 virions. Figure 11 : Spikes scattered on the surface of the 3D mesh according to the assigned amounts per triangle. Membrane and envelope proteins are uniformly distributed on the membrane. The S protein model was obtained by a composite homology modelling approach. Residues 27-1146 were modelled with SWISS-MODEL [57] using 6VXX as template, in order to reconstruct all the missing loops that were not solved in the experimental structure. Residues 1147-1212, 1213-1242, 1243-1273 corresponding to HR2, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain respectively were submitted separately to the homology modeling server for oligomeric structures GalaxyHomomer [1] . Template-based modeling generated the HR2 structural model, utilizing the structure of MERS-CoV fusion core (PDBid 4MOD, 39% sequence identity) as template, while transmembrane and cytoplasmic models originated from ab-initio modeling methods. Structures of the four components were aligned in PyMol [51] and merged to obtain a unique model in Coot [11] . Pentameric E protein was modelled with the protein structure prediction server Robetta [25] in 'comparative modeling' mode. The NMR structure of E protein from SARS-CoV (PDBid 5X29) was used as template, as the two proteins share 94% of their amino acid sequence. The structural model for M protein (residues 11-203) was predicted by DeepMind using AlphaFold prediction methods and freely distributed in response to the COVID-19 crisis [23] .

N protein folds to form two stable globular domains, connected by a flexible linker. The C-terminal domain (CTD) forms dimers, as seen in PDBid 6WJI of the SARS-CoV-2 CTD. In the SARS CTD, these dimers may further associate into octamers as seen in PDBid 2CJR. The structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) has been determined in PDBid 6YI3, and is often termed the RNA-binding domain, although RNA binds to multiple sites in the N protein [24] . In cryoelectron micrographs, the nucleoprotein complex is seen to have short-range order as a close-packed collection of spherical features closely opposed to M protein on the inner face of the membrane [40] , and gently-isolated nucleoprotein complexes have the look of rope-like collection of beads roughly 15 nm wide [34] . These data have been integrated into a conceptual model where CTD octamers stack loosely into long ropes and NTD are loosely associated around the central rope, interacting with RNA [17] . We have implemented this conceptual model, first building CTD octamers, then placing NTD, and finally building a continuous RNA strand that winds through the NTD. Explicit models for the intrinsically-disordered linkers and flexible portions of the N chain at the N-and C-termini will be a subject for future study. In the rest of this section the modeling process is described. Firstly the model of virion is created. In the following section the process of RNA construction is described.",

If this assignment is skipped, the default rotation, as stored in the data file, is used. The whole modeling phase is done taking into account the estimated amount of individual elements published in [2] . We implemented a tool in which the user can segment 2D electron microscopy images (see Figure 3) . Firstly, the scale of the image has to be set. We implemented a widget for selecting a portion of the image and assigning a real-world length. The tool then computes this scale and uses throughout the entire segmentation process. Afterwards, the user manually segments the image and creates the outer contour by drawing a polyline enclosing the virion. After the outer polyline is done, the inner contour is created by scaling down the outer contour. The scaling is driven by the user and can be updated whenever necessary. Once the inner contour is defined, the band between outer and inner contour is automatically subdivided into 10 equally-sized regions. As the last step, the user visually identifies the spikes in the image and marks them using proxy objects available in our utility. The tool automatically identifies the closest virion for the particle and assigns the particle into the corresponding contour region. After this assignment, the histogram is updated. Outer contour and histogram are the input for the statistical learning (Section 4). We process the data and estimate a new contour as described previously. From the newly generated contour we create a 3D triangular mesh and assign each of its triangles the amount of containing S-protein instances based on the histogram sampling (see Figure 2 ). In the next step S proteins are placed on the surface of the mesh. The user specifies the distance of the center point of a spike to the surface of the 3D mesh and the number of spikes to be placed. The parent-child rule Section 5.3 is used: the parent is the 3D mesh and children are the spikes. The illustration is depicted in Figure 11 . A similar rule is used for both M and E proteins. The only difference is that these protein instances are uniformly distributed, i. e.no amounts distributed over the 3D mesh based on observation on the contour is taken into account. These protein are not discernible on the images and their distribution is to date not characterized. For the time being our model assumes a uniform distribution on the mesh. For illustration see Figure 11 .",

In the following step (see Figure 12 bottom-left) 2CTD is bound to rotated 2CTD using siblings-parent rule Section 5.3 to a linear skeleton. This forms a tetramer 4CTD. Repeatedly, 4CTD is bound using linear skeleton to another instance of 4CTD forming an octamer 8CTD. The final N protein assembly is constructed using siblings-parent rule of 8CTD and a polyline skeleton. To create the polyline skeleton, we uniformly fill the interior of the 3D mesh by instances of a proxy object. This proxy object is a sphere that is customized to have a radius approximately the same size as the radius of bounding sphere of 8CTD. Applying connection rule Section 5.3 on such proxy spheres we obtain the polyline skeleton. Finally, siblings-parent rule is applied to 8CTD and the polyline forming the N protein assembly is created. RNA is then added to form the entire nucleoprotein complex, as described in the next section.",

In reality, both layers can be modeled by the similar rule with the only exception that the lipids in one layer are rotated so that they are oriented to each other with their hydrophobic part. The construction of a single layer is as follows: Two copies of the same lipid models are added into the scene. The user creates a rule with several relations by translating (and rotating) one copy of the model to desired positions and stores these positions together with the distance to the 3D mesh parental skeleton. In our model, 7 relations R i are created (see Figure 13 left) for a transition from a lipid to another lipid. We use two models of different lipids -Li 1 and Li 2 . Therefore, there are 7 relations for each of the combination: Li 1 \u2192 Li 2 , Li 2 \u2192 Li 1 , Li 1 \u2192 Li 1 . The generating process starts in randomly chosen triangle of the 3D mesh parental skeleton. In the beginning, one lipid is added. In the next steps up to 7 new lipids can be generated. The rule is re-applied on these new instances. This process continues until 100 consecutive collision hits are accumulated which indicates a fully dense lipid membrane. Populating models over the surface only by limited amount of relations would lead to an occurrence of visible patterns. This is tackled by fine-tuning the rotation of newly placed element by specifying how can standard deviation in yaw, pitch, roll vary (see Figure 13 right).",

This real world experience of streaming new information has confirmed that our modeling framework is versatile enough to accommodate for new revisions with a given set of rules, and that the modeling is a rapid process when it comes to complex structural characteristics of a virus particle. The benefit of the rule-based modeling is the nature of templating that becomes advantageous in a highly similar models of biological assemblies. Therefore, for example, once the RNA rules are specified, these can be effortlessly brought to another model. In case more structural knowledge comes in or a more advanced model of the RNA is refined, such model can be used in all mesoscale models which contain the RNA rule. The templating can be utilized for example in capsids, fibers, or membranes. This property inherently supports collaborative efforts, where one modeller revises initial models of the others and gradually a community can build a large base of mesoscale biological assemblies.",

The population of lipids is the most computationally demanding part of the algorithm, it takes approximately two minutes for each inner and outer membrane.
