GIS/GPS-assisted methods provide a promising alternative, but these methods need further improvement. We established a stratified 3-stage GIS/GPS-assisted sampling method in which residential areas of a target population are divided into mutually exclusive cells -geographic units (geounits) as the primary sampling frame (PSF). Geounits with residential households were randomly selected from the PSF with a semi-automatic algorithm implemented in R. Novel methods were used to sample households and participants. Simulations and application studies indicated adequate feasibility, efficiency and validity of the method in sampling rural-to-urban migrants from a large city with complex residential arrangements. With this method, researchers can determine sample size and number of geounits, households and participants to be sampled; optimally allocate geounits; determine area size of sampled geounits and estimate sample weights; and complete sampling for field data collection in a short period.

First, it is challenging to pre-determine the sample size for several reasons (Landry et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2012; Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter 2013b) . The method consists of two steps: sample geographic areas, then sample participants in selected areas. Sample size is easy to determine if a study only needs to draw geographic samples (Balch, Drapeau, Bowler, Booth, Goes et al. 2004; Chen, Zhao, Gao, Henkelmann, and Schramm 2006; Conway 2006; Daly, Lei, Teixeira, Muir, Castillo et al. 2007; Huang, Zhao, Shi, Yu, Zhao et al. 2007; Valliant et al. 2013b : Pearson et al. 2015 . However, it is not possible to know exactly how many persons are present in a randomly sampled geographic area before the area is selected (Landry et al. 2005; Shannon et al. 2012; Valliant et al. 2013b; Chen et al. 2015) . One solution is to enumerate all households in a randomly sampled area after a geographic area is selected. This method has often proved infeasible (Landry et al. 2005; Escamilla et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015) because of high and variable population density, complex residential structure, and presence of high-rise and multi-function buildings in selected geographic areas. Second, GIS/GPS-assisted sampling method needs to distinguish residential from non-residential housing. Methods for distinguishing between the two have proven very time-consuming to implement (Chen et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2012; Escamilla et al. 2014; Kondo et al. 2014; Pearson et al. 2015) . Recent methods haven been developed to recognize visually or digitally residential areas/housing with widely available aerial images (Chang et al. 2009; Wampler et al. 2013; Escamilla et al. 2014; Haenssgen 2015; Pearson et al. 2015) . These methods are fast, inexpensive, and highly feasible. However, correctly recognizing residential houses remains a big problem even with the assistance of people from local communities. For example, Pearson et al. (2015) conducted a study to determine residential households using aerial images. With assistance of local experts after computerized sampling, five out of 175 determined residential household structures were verified in the field to be nonresidential. Although the error rate is not high, this study was conducted in a semi-nomadic pastoral area, a setting much simpler for random sampling than that of a modern urban area. More research is needed to improve this method for use in sampling complex residential areas (Escamilla et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015; Haenssgen 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 189, "text": "(Landry et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 190, "end": 208, "text": "Singh et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 209, "end": 244, "text": "Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter 2013b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 432, "end": 481, "text": "(Balch, Drapeau, Bowler, Booth, Goes et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 482, "end": 528, "text": "Chen, Zhao, Gao, Henkelmann, and Schramm 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 529, "end": 541, "text": "Conway 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 542, "end": 590, "text": "Daly, Lei, Teixeira, Muir, Castillo et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 591, "end": 630, "text": "Huang, Zhao, Shi, Yu, Zhao et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 631, "end": 652, "text": "Valliant et al. 2013b", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 653, "end": 674, "text": ": Pearson et al. 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 816, "end": 836, "text": "(Landry et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 837, "end": 857, "text": "Shannon et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 858, "end": 880, "text": "Valliant et al. 2013b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 881, "end": 898, "text": "Chen et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1069, "text": "(Landry et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1092, "text": "Escamilla et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1110, "text": "Chen et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1486, "text": "(Chen et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1505, "text": "Singh et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1528, "text": "Escamilla et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1547, "text": "Kondo et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1568, "text": "Pearson et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1723, "text": "(Chang et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1744, "text": "Wampler et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1767, "text": "Escamilla et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1783, "text": "Haenssgen 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1784, "end": 1804, "text": "Pearson et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2030, "text": "Pearson et al.

The fundamental mechanism of our method is to link geographic area with varying population density to households using numerous small geounits for further sampling. Therefore, one natural approach to deal with varying population density is application of the classic stratified sampling strategy to optimize geounit allocation (Cochran 1977) , as have been commonly used in this and other studies (Galway et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2015) .

In this study, we used the random route approach (Bauer 2016) , by randomly selecting one household as starting point and then following natural order to select other households until the pre-determined number of households was reached. However, our method may lead to biased estimates of parameters that are related to physical distance. This can happen even with carefully planned and well-tested instructions (Bauer 2016) . If conditions permit, an ideal approach would be to list all households in a sampled geounit first and then randomly select the pre-determined number of household for further sampling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 274, "text": "(Bauer 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 625, "end": 637, "text": "(Bauer 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recommendation for Application"}, {"text": "In this study, we only demonstrate our method in sampling rural migrants in urban China. A full assessment of the value of our approach requires its application to different populations in diverse geographic and residential settings. Like any multistage sampling method, it is a challenge to ensure an equal probability sample of households. The random route provides a good option, but attention must be paid to instructions to the data collectors and random selection of the starting household (Bauer 2016) . Data on the size of a geographic unit is often not directly available, and can be obtained only through repeated pilot tests. Given large variations in household and population density in urban settings, large variations in estimated sample weights are anticipated.
