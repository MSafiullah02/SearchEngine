            "text": "Background: With the global outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic since early 2020, there has been considerable attention on CT-based diagnosis as an effective and reliable method. Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists' diagnosis performance improves when incorporating ai-corona's prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCR's diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods.",

According to the radiologists' advice, the preliminary dataset of 2124 spiral CT scans was obtained by removing High-Resolution (HR) and abdominal CTs, which are not ideal for COVID-19 diagnosis.

The most important clinical features of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and myalgia or fatigue. Although sputum production, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, headache, haemoptysis and diarrhea are seen as less common symptoms. [2, 3] Since RT-PCR alone does not have a high sensitivity in COVID-19 diagnosis (as is explained more in section 3), we do not rely solely on its diagnosis, which is in contrary of what has been done in this research topic such as [10, 27] , and in addition, we include the other mentioned metrics for truth annotation.

The patient specimen sampling was done in the early days of the hospitalization. As shown in Figure 4 , RT-PCR's sensitivity starts at 0.362 (95% CI: 0.315, 0.409) and peaks at 0.579 (95% CI: 0.537, 0.621). The peak is an upper bound, because if instead of testing patients hospitalized for more than three days, every COVID-19 admitted patient was tested, RT-PCR's sensitivity would be much lower than 0.579. This result is comparable to the sensitivity of RT-PCR on specimens collected from patients deemed suspicious with COVID-19 infection by radiologists reported in [10] . We must point that, with more time and experience, the clinical respiratory samplings and adaptation and conducting the molecular testings were made more efficient and reliable, which would explain the improvement in RT-PCR's sensitivity during the examination period. Hereafter, we take the maximum value of RT-PCR's sensitivity as it's best and move forward from there. Various combinations of performance comparison are made in our evaluation. In our work, RT-PCR's specificity was not available to us. Hence, its performance is represented as a solid horizontal line in Figure 5a , with a fixed sensitivity of 0.579 and a specificity in the range of [0, 1]. The shaded area around the solid horizontal line indicates the 95% confidence interval. A summery of ai-corona's AUC scores for all the comparisons is brought in Table 1 . Furthermore, Table 2 shows the diagnosis time for ai-corona and the radiologists for all the 357 cases in the validation set, which points out one of the obvious advantages of AI over the humans; time. The first comparison is associated with distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes. Figure 5a shows the ROC diagram of this comparison.

Diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrations are detected with crazy paving pattern, ground glass, and traction bronchiectasis, mainly in the right lung and partial volume loss of the right lung. Anterior mediastinal soft-tissue density is seen. The position of central venous catheter tip is seen in the left brachiocephalic vein.\" Finally, Figure 6d 's case was misdiagnosed by all the radiologists and ai-corona. Complicated imaging manifestations of bacterial infection or emphysematous changes or pulmonary edema can obscure the typical imaging findings of COVID-19. For instance, architectural distortion in cases with emphysema or consolidation opacities in bacterial infections make it difficult to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT images.",

As the other forms of pulmonary abnormalities are all bundled up in only one additional class, ai-corona is in a slight disadvantage in distinguishing between COVID-19 and non COVID-19 abnormalities, which will open up a possible research direction for future. With accurate abnormality annotations, besides COVID-19, a capable deep learning framework would certainly perform better. Additionally, evaluating ai-corona on external validation data is most necessary. In conclusion, with the individual drawbacks of diagnosing based on clinical representation, RT-PCR, and CT-based diagnosis, a method comprised of all three would definitely yield the most accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.",
