The first reported case in the US was in Washington State on January 19, 2020. Since that time the COVID-19 pandemic has affected most of the world and there are currently over 450,000 cases and over 17,000 deaths reported in the US alone. The unprecedented viral pandemic has motivated rapid societal change, primarily with efforts directed at social distancing in an effort to flatten the peak of the pandemic curve and has also substantially strained health care resources to manage the exponential burden of the disease. Although front-line health care providers involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the respiratory transmitted virus deserve most (all) credit, the pandemic has also created challenges for other medical service lines, including orthopaedic surgery. In order to ensure and provide for adequate health care resources, hospital capacity, personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), service lines such as adult reconstruction and lower limb arthroplasty have stopped or substantially limited elective surgeries and have been forced to re-engineer care processes for a high-volume of patients.",

Our arthroplasty services are both comprised of four high-volume fellowship-trained lower limb arthroplasty surgeons, as well as a combined ten advanced practice clinicians (APCs), seven registered nurses (RNs), and multiple other providers including medical assistants (MAs), physical therapists (PTs), administrative assistants and support staff. Additionally, both are educational training centers for orthopaedic residents and fellows and have a strong research mission as well.

In Arkansas we perform primary and complex revision surgeries at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) hospital as well as primary and simple revision surgery at Baptist Conway Medical Center. In 2019, the University of Utah service performed over 2000 hip and knee replacement surgeries including a high-rate of revision joint replacement surgery (approximately 25%) combined with over 14,000 clinic visits while the UAMS service performed 1800 joint replacement procedures and completed over 8,000 clinical visits. More than 30% of the volume at UAMS included arthroplasty surgeries to treat revision, infections and/or periprosthetic fractures about the hip and knee. Given these volumes, the changes that have been required in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are unquestionably significant in their impact.",

The Arkansas Department of Health released a similar statement on March 30th. The impetus for the Utah directive was based on the premise of the shared understanding that preservation of health care resources was of utmost importance. Similarly, the academic referral centers were also potential hubs for COVID-19 cases and referrals. To date, this state directive has not been interpreted similarly nor followed by all hospital systems in the state of Utah or Arkansas, in part due to smaller and rural medical centers feeling little impacts in resource restrictions or burden of respiratory cases.",

The sites of care were set up to be covered by the minimum essential staff on a rotating weekly coverage schedule. Residents not currently in the active direct patient care platoons have been assigned work from home and provided enhanced educational assignments (described below). At Utah, fellows entered a platoon to alternate with the residents to further mitigate the burden across additional individuals needing to be present at any one time on the inpatient service.",

At both centers, our most senior surgeons serve in leadership roles, and it was felt best to temporarily remove them from direct patient contact as much as possible. Nurses and other clinic staff have moved to a mostly telecommuting model to work from home, wherein they have maintained care coordination and clinical management duties effectively.

However, as the projected data became clear that the likely duration of the pandemic was going to be prolonged, it became obvious that this strategy was unfair to patients who were being cancelled as it created a \u201cleap frog\u201d scheduling scenario: patients being cancelled had likely signed up for surgery prior to the patients the week after, creating confusion and staff chaos. Additionally, the short notice we provided to our patients was likely inadequate due to travel, work and family scheduling. Further, we were giving false hope of surgery to patients not yet cancelled. Finally, this approach failed to account for the urgent/complex cases that may have warranted surgery more expediently than other patients due to the potential for ongoing and/or irreversible damage with prolonged delay. In Arkansas, the decision was initially made to reschedule all elective, non-urgent cases until the end of April with the understanding that we would call to reschedule. On April 7, 2020, the decision was made to extend this approach until May 31, 2020.",

            "text": "As we look at returning to normal operating room practices at our academic hospitals and outpatient surgery centers, we will likely be faced with difficult decisions regarding prioritization of patients secondary to limited resources within our system. The most likely limited resource will be that of operating room availability and anesthesia providers along with nursing/support personnel as all surgeons within the system will be trying to work through the large backlog of scheduled cases. The second potential resource restriction will be that of limited PPE. If inadequate PPE exists, cases with short operative times and higher volumes are likely to burn through more PPE than longer/complex cases, where fewer gowns/gloves/masks would be used by default due to less changes throughout the day. In this scenario, the short operative time surgeries may be less appropriate to push into the system during early ramp up of elective surgery, even in healthy and likely outpatient surgical candidates. The third potential resource limitation may come in the way of limited hospital space/capacity in terms of bed availability or nursing capacity. If hospital beds remain the limited resource, longer/complex cases in patients with higher comorbidity burden are less desirable, and the healthy patients that can be done efficiently and safely sent home are more likely to be more suitable in this scenario. Finally, the availability of testing screening for providers and patients may be a resource limitation if it remains a limited resource, or perhaps just as likely, a potential variable that allows for an accelerated return to increased clinical care if the resource is readily available. It remains unclear as to the timeline of availability of widespread testing. It is likely that a negative COVID-19 test will be needed in the preoperative preparation phase before surgery.",

To date within our Orthopaedic Surgery Departments alone, we have postponed a combined of over 1450 elective cases that will need to be rescheduled across multiple subspecialities. Due to the aforementioned resource restrictions, either we will all be trying to push through as many relatively young healthy cases all at once, or trying to get through the more urgent, and often more difficult cases. It is unclear which of these scenarios we will begin with, or if it will be a hybrid of the two. However, we are preparing ourselves to be nimble in this time of transition and quickly adjust our surgical scheduling with the use of the scaling systems described above in the Phase 1 description. The two scoring systems of surgical complexity, predicted length of stay as well as patient age and comorbidities will help us to properly stratify our patients and adapt to whatever ramp up strategy we are faced with in Phase 4 of this pandemic. Weighing this with institutional PPE and health care provider availability, it is our hope is that we will be positioned to efficiently, within our arthroplasty division, as well as within the orthopaedic department and across the surgical system, identify those patients most suitable to bring in for surgery as we are allowed to return to the operating room.",

Later revisions of that CMS public statement (last update April 7, 2020) removed reference to particular procedure types and expanded considerations that should help guide decisions of the cessation of surgeries to include the surrounding region, and not just the practice or hospital, given that we are all members of a larger healthcare delivery system to a population, as opposed to an isolated silo of care within the walls of a single institution. Given the lack of firm guidance, most centers have created written and internally monitored criteria to follow. At our centers, this has included emergent surgeries due to life and limb threat, the potential for significant harm if ongoing delay due to severe joint destruction, bone loss or uncontrollable pain, in addition to fractures, infections and dislocations.",

The currently poorly understood prevalence of asymptomatic carriers along with the potential inability of current testing to detect cases in the early state of COVID-19 infection can lead to us further falsely believing that we could bring in a \u201chealthy\u201d patient, who in fact may even be a carrier, and risk exposing our healthcare teams or even risk worse creating outcomes for the patient. Recent studies have suggested that the act of surgery may worsen the outcomes in some patients in the unrecognized incubation period [5]. Even for the healthiest of patients, beyond the potential exposure risk, there is a burden for the perioperative care that is placed in the supporting healthcare system which is already taxed with the preparation for and care of COVID-19 related cases. This infrastructure must be protected until we can safely move forward as unified healthcare community.",

We have taken a cautious approach in many of these cases as well, as it is these patients with the worst orthopaedic conditions who often also have advanced age, severe medical or social comorbidities and additional risk factors. These are also the patients most likely to require postsurgical stays in inpatient facilities, which could add further risk of exposure [6]. Surgery in many of these patients goes beyond exposure operating room, but extends into the inpatient facilities, outpatient or home health nurse or therapists, skilled nursing facilities, laboratories, imaging centers and the community through which they must navigate in order to receive their perioperative care. The decision to operate in these patients exposes them to many risks beyond our standard joint replacement risks, significantly challenging the risk-reward balance.",

There is no doubt that many of our treatment interventions and modalities that we typically offer mandates in person contact (including some rehab care, injection therapy and surgery). While many of these interventions are not currently offered due to the needed response, we have been able to use this time to realize there exists some potential over-reliance on routine protocols for burdensome visits, imaging and studies that may be able to be minimized and, as a result, efficiencies may be added into routine care. Such efficiencies and value may be added by eliminating unnecessary in-person visits that are expensive in both the time and money required of both patients and families. The limited resource of physical clinic space in some practices can be preserved for patients truly needing in-person visits, and potentially even expanding capacity as a result. Additionally, there can be improved efficiencies realized by virtual visits in having all of the information needed and verified in advance by medical assistants, as well as eliminating the rooming and room cleaning time, etc. While patients still requiring imaging or in person visits are accommodated today, as they will be in the future, additional efficiencies, including offering patients the opportunity to receive labs and imaging remote locations, even at sites outside our own healthcare networks, are also likely to prove beneficial to both patients and providers moving forward.",
