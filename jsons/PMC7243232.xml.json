The interactions in these SC ecosystems are very complex and triggered by mutual interrelations and feedbacks between SCs, nature, society, and the economy. Being initially developed in the veins of leanness and agility, and their combination as leagility (Christopher and Towill 2000; Lee 2004; Goldsby et al. 2006; Eckstein et al. 2015; Gunasekaran et al. 2016; Dubey et al. 2018; Fadaki et al. 2020), SC research has been extended by the perspectives of resilience (Christopher and Peck 2004; Blackhurst et al. 2005; Tang 2006; Sawik 2011; Spiegler et al. 2012; Dubey et al. 2019a; Hosseini et al. 2019a; Wood et al. 2019) and sustainability (Seuring 2013; Brandenburg and Rebs 2015; Dubey et al. 2015; Allaoui et al. 2019) followed by the advanced utilization of digital technologies and Industry 4.0 (Wamba et al. 2015; Ivanov et al. 2016; Choi et al. 2018; Dolgui et al. 2020, 2020a; Dubey et al. 2019b; Ivanov et al. 2019b; Ghadge et al. 2020; Queiroz et al. 2020) (Fig. 1).",

As such, the question of market and society survivability was raised. For other SCs, demand and supply have drastically dropped resulting in production stops (e.g., automotive industry), the danger of bankruptcies, and the necessity of governmental supports. Here the questions of SC survivability again arose. It is evident that both of these questions go beyond the existing state of the art in SC leagility, sustainability, and resilience because they cannot be resolved individually within each of these perspectives and require integrated frameworks and an extension when long-term, severe global disruptions affect all elements of SC ecosystems (i.e., businesses, society, nature, and economies).",

According to Ivanov and Dolgui (2020b), \u201cviability is a behavior-driven property of a system with structural dynamics. It considers system evolution through disruption-reaction balancing in the open system context. The viability analysis is survival-oriented at a long-term scale.\u201d Ivanov (2018b, p. 59) defines SC viability as an \u201cability to survive and exist after a disruption [\u2026.] with the re-design of the supply chain structure and re-planning economic performance with long-term impacts.\u201d This SC ability to meet the demands of surviving in a changing environment follows the notions of the Viable System Model by Beer (1985) developed for intercompany perspective and ecology modeling angles (Aubin 1991). Viability in this context can be understood considering approaches in ecological modeling. Ecological modeling is a research area concerned with the analysis of ecosystems in dynamics (Gross et al. 2004, 2009). Recent literature points to a resemblance of SCs to ecosystems (Byrne et al. 2018; Gross et al. 2018; Demirel et al. 2019; Nair and Reed-Tsochas 2019).",

Our contribution lies in conceptualization of a VSC model spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply\u2013demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.",

Viability is the highest analysis level for SC reactions to disturbances which is based upon stability, robustness and resilience as follows:Stability The ability to return to a pre-disturbance state and ensure a continuity (Ivanov and Sokolov 2013; Demirel et al. 2019)Robustness The ability to withstand a disruption (or a series of disruptions) to maintain the planned performance (Nair and Vidal 2011; Simchi-Levi et al. 2018)Resilience The ability to withstand a disruption (or a series of disruptions) and recover the performance (Spiegler et al. 2012; Hosseini et al. 2019a; Zhao et al. 2019).Viability The ability to maintain itself and survive in a changing environment over a long period of time through a redesign of the structures and replanning of economic performance with long-term impacts (Ivanov 2018b, p. 59; Ivanov and Dolgui 2020b).",

Beer\u2019s Viable System Model (Beer 1985) allows us to understand how interconnected operations communicate with changing market environments and meta-systems such as markets, policy, and society. Through the lens of viability, the Beer\u2019s model builds upon an analogy with the human organism as the most advanced, survival-oriented complex system. According to Ashby\u2019s law of requisite variety (Ashby 1956), the situational variety should be balanced by the response variety of the controller or \u201conly variety absorbs variety.\u201d This law can be considered as one of the VSC pillars in the development of highly diversified and decentralized systems able to respond to increasing variety in the external systems such as new market models (e.g., omnichannel), new business models (e.g., circular economy), positive disruptions (e.g., innovations), and negative disruptions (e.g., natural catastrophes), to build resilient and sustainable operational systems. Moreover, VSC poses open system context analysis. An open system (Mesarovic and Takahara 1975; Casti et al. 1979) is a system that has interactions with the environment and evolves based on these interactions. The major characteristics of open systems are control, self-adaptation, and self-organization (von Bertallanfy 1969), which can be seen as future-leading management principles for VSC.",

The structural view represents three SC structures which are activated through adaptation and recovery actions (note that the mathematical symbols used in Fig. 3 will be discussed later in Sect. 3). Here we follow the research stream on structural SC adaptations (Allesina et al. 2010; Ivanov et al. 2010; Pavlov et al. 2019a). The VSC structural view can be exemplified as follows. Consider a car manufacturer with a global SC. This SC can have one structural design at the times of economic stability and growth with full utilization of global sourcing, lean and agility advantages, offering a broad variety of products to satisfy individual customer needs (Dubey et al. 2018). The second structural design relates to the disruptions and maintaining the resilience in case of singular, local events such as natural disasters, strikes, fires, etc. This kind of design, i.e., the resilient SC builds around proactive and reactive capabilities such as risk mitigation inventory, capacity flexibilities, and backup suppliers (Hosseini et al. 2019). Finally, in cases of long-term, global disruptions such as COVID-19 pandemic, the third SC design is adapted which might be characterized by production changeovers (e.g., production of ventilators or masks instead of cars), reducing the product variety, radical changes in supplier base and logistics, and production localization (Simchi-Levi 2020).",

The horizontal transitions [e.g., between X1(S11) and X1(S12)] reflect the SC configuration changes within the same layer (e.g., the leagility). These structural transformations happen, for example, at the leagility level due to the re-designing a supplier base or a distribution network based on profit improvements or cost reduction activities. The vertical transitions between the states are triggered by adaptation against disruptions and recovery. We note that the structures and states can have a single dimension representing SC configurations in the form of a network design as composed of different organizations and also be considered from the multi-structural point of view combining organizational, informational, financial, product, and process-functional structures.

            "text": "The VSC model extends the existing state-of-the-art SC resilience knowledge and builds upon the resilient mechanisms that have been extensively discussed and classified in the studies by Bier et al. (2020), Ho et al. (2015), Hosseini et al. (2019a), Ivanov et al. (2017), Melnyk et al. (2014), Pettit et al. (2019), Snyder et al. (2016), and Tukamuhabwa et al. (2015), to name a few. In addition, literature on the SC ripple effect allows deducing the SC viability antecedents and drivers (Ivanov et al. 2014a, b; Garvey et al. 2015; Dolgui et al. 2018; Levner and Ptuskin 2018; Scheibe and Blackhurst 2018; Hosseini and Ivanov 2019; Ivanov et al. 2019a; Kinra et al. 2020; Li et al. 2019; Mishra et al. 2019; Sinha et al. 2020; Dixit et al. 2020; Dolgui et al. 2020b; Garvey and Carnovale 2020; Goldbeck et al. 2020; Li and Zobel 2020; \u00d6z\u00e7elik et al. 2020). Most of the SC resilience studies build their arguments around capacity and inventory reservations as well as back-up suppliers to cope with SC disruptions (Behzadi et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2011; L\u00fccker et al. 2017, 2019; Hosseini et al. 2019b; Ivanov and Rozhkov 2017; Paul et al. 2019; Paul and Rahman 2018; Sawik 2016, 2019; Schmitt et al. 2017; Song et al. 2018; Spiegler et al. 2016, 2017; Yin and Wang 2018; Yoon et al. 2018). Some studies extended the operational discussion toward the product substitution and process/product modularity as mitigation and recovery policies (Lu et al. 2011; Gupta and Ivanov 2020). In addition, a few studies investigated structural and operational dynamics in the SC in an integrated manner (Ivanov and Sokolov 2019; Dolgui et al. 2020b). Finally, the developments in digital technologies have been utilized in SC resilience research (Baryannis et al. 2019; Dubey et al. 2019b; Ivanov et al. 2019b; Queiroz et al. 2019; Ivanov and Dolgui 2020a; Fragapane et al. 2020) pointing to the contributions of digital technology to SC viability in the areas of improving demand forecasting by data analytics, production flexibility by additive manufacturing, and SC visibility using digital twins.",

The resilience would be assessed by a performance of the car manufacturer, e.g., annual revenues or service level. From the positions of viability, the SC of the car manufacturer should ensure leagility and profitability, be resilient and deliver the mobility service to society at a long-term perspective.",

In our understanding, SC resilience is close to the role of immune systems, and viability is the ability to survive over the whole life through absorbing negative impacts with the help of a strong immune system and achieving performance by using positive chances. A strong immune system and acting in line with nature and society help human beings achieving high performances. Similarly, the SC performance depends on the resilience and sustainability. A weak immune system may result in performance degradation. Low SC resilience, if a disruption is experienced, also results in profitability reductions, mismatches of demand and supply, and destabilization of normal operations. Continuing the analogy, immune systems of each human being are in a continuous interaction with the environment. This property is reflected by viability in terms of utilizing positive feedbacks with the environment (e.g., making profits in growing markets), sustaining against negative impacts (e.g., facility disruptions) and surviving in a case of substantial changes in the environments, e.g., global pandemics. Put simply: strong immune systems help the living organisms to live and survive; strong resilience helps SCs to perform over the whole lifecycle and under different positive and negative conditions, i.e. to be viable.",

Different from linearly directed SCs with static structures, the firms in ISNs may exhibit multiple behaviors in buyer\u2013supplier relations (i.e., behavioral dynamics) in interconnected or even competing SCs simultaneously. These new dynamic, co-evolving structures require rethinking of some traditional analysis concepts and could be very interesting in regard to SC viability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic clearly showed complex, and at times unforeseen interconnections between industrial, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and food SCs. As such, novel, cross-sectoral and adaptable SC designs can be examined in future. This research avenue will be supplemented by investigations in flexible production/service technologies and human\u2013robot collaborations for timely reactions to changing environments and switching between three feedback cycles of the VSC model (e.g., a switch from car manufacturing at \u201cnormal\u201d times to ventilator production during a pandemic). Obviously, these adaptable structures and technologies are expected to be supported by innovative product and facility designs engaging all actors in the SC ecosystems from public and private sectors.",

For example, optimization techniques can be used for multi-level SC design (cf. Fig. 3). Simulation methods can be applied to recovery analysis (Ivanov 2020a). Ecological modelling can shed light on underlying behaviors of collective survivals (Demirel et al. 2019, Ivanov and Dolgui 2020b). Bayesian networks can help in analyzing causal relationships and disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect) in the networks (Garvey et al. 2015, Hosseini et al. 2019). Interactions in the intertwined SCs and ecosystems would open new problem settings for game-theoretic studies. We also see new applications for control theory in the area of SC viability due to feedback and dynamics considerations (Ivanov and Sokolov 2013). A specific role can be played by hybrid data-driven approaches blended with optimization.",

Our approach integrates the angles of sustainability and resilience, extending them by survivability, and offers a VSC framework within SC ecosystems. The principal ideas of the VSC model are multiple structural SC designs for supply\u2013demand matching and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. We argue in favor of adaptable networks that exhibit the features of leagility, resilience against disruptions, and pandemic-resistance.",
