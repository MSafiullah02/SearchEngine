The measurements included demographic, 53 socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and 54 psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were 55 considered as primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were 56 considered as main secondary outcomes. Notably, In the last two follow-ups, each patient 57 attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the 58 Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory 59 functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, a 60 total of 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57\u00b115 61 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes 62 of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%).

The anxiety subscale score 231 was also divided into five groups: extremely severe anxiety (20-42), severe anxiety (15-232 19), moderate anxiety (10-14), mild anxiety (7-9), and normal (0-6). The depression 233 subscale was formed using questions three, five, ten, thirteen, sixteen, seventeen, and 234 twenty-one. The total depression subscale score was classified as extremely severe 235 depression (28-42), severe depression (21-27), moderate depression (13-20), mild 236 depression (10-12), and normal (0-9).

The endpoint in this study was death or 265 cure from the entire COVID-19-related causes. We confirmed the endpoint by reviewing 266 hospital medical registration, or by calling using the registered phone number.

However, the distribution of age (p<0.001), sex (p=0.010), 299 symptom duration (p=0.010), and quarantine before admission (p=0.0140) were 300 significantly different in PCEP positive and negative groups.

However, except for 307 Mg (p=0.500), and platelet count (p=0.051), other laboratory findings were significant in 308 the analyzed groups.

However, the platelet counts decreased in the PCEP group, but it was not 312 significant (p=0.051). Moreover, the lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in the 313 PCEP positive class (p<0.001). 314",
