The authors pointed to the importance of therapeutic reassessment of all psoriatic patients, particularly those with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe disease, who are candidate to systemic, mostly immunosuppressive, therapies in the era of COVID\u201019. The authors recommended topical and/or drugs with a lower impact on the immune system to avoid spread of the infection.\n1\nThough of interest, we have few points to comment on these recommendations based on the current literature review.",

Older patients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe disease are more prone to cardiovascular and neurological comorbidities, such as hypertension and dementia, respectively. Independent of treatment, there is a twofold increased risk of serious infections among older adults with psoriasis compared to those without psoriasis. COVID\u201019\u2010infected patients with hypertension are associated with higher rate of morbidity and mortality. COVID\u201019 virus has neurotropic potential that partially explains the higher rate of acute respiratory distress in elderly patients.2, 3\n",

Older adults should be offered the same level of disease control as all psoriasis patients.\n7\n Others noted that new users of apremilast, etanercept, and ustekinumab are at lower risk rate of serious infection compared with those on methotrexate.\n8\n interleukin 17 inhibitors have lower effects on personal immune functions compared to traditional immunosuppressives and could be also considered in the priority.\n9\n The tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 inhibitors, adalimumab is currently under evaluation for use in treating severe COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Unwise patients stopping biologics temporarily with or without their physician recommendation may lead to development of antidrug antibodies, and possible loss of response when these drugs reintroduced.10, 11\n",
