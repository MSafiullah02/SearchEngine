            "text": "Coyotes (Canis latrans) are native North American wild canids. Their reproductive strategy includes social monogamy, territoriality (Camenzind, 1978, Andelt, 1985, Bekoff and Wells, 1986, Gese, 2001), and biparental care of offspring (Gier, 1968, Silver and Silver, 1969, Mengel, 1971, Camenzind, 1978, Andelt, 1985, Hatier, 1995). Confined to a single mating season each winter, coyote reproduction is regulated by the female's annual ovarian cycle, as well as seasonal fluctuation in male spermatogenesis (Hamlett, 1938, Gier, 1968, Kennelly, 1978, Sacks, 2005). Ovulation is spontaneous, synchronous, and bilateral (Hamlett, 1938, Kennelly and Johns, 1976). Gier (1968) considered early embryonic development in the coyote to be similar to the domestic dog (Canis familiaris); thus embryos likely pass into the uterus 8\u201310 days after ovulation, and placentation begins around day 16 (Holst and Phemister, 1971, Concannon et al., 1989, Tsutsui, 1989). Coyote litters averaging 3\u20137 pups are typically born March\u2013May in most North American latitudes after a gestation of 60\u201363 days (Hamlett, 1938, Gier, 1968).",

Although the coyote's diet includes a variety of foods (Gier, 1968, Andelt et al., 1987), predation of livestock can occur when domestic animals range within a coyote territory. Not unexpectedly, therefore, alpha coyotes have been implicated as the primary killers (Blejwas et al., 2002). Presumably parents are exploiting a nutritionally rich and easily accessible resource for young dependent pups, and if so, contraception represents a promising non-lethal solution to coyote-human conflicts. Accordingly, Bromley and Gese, 2001a, Bromley and Gese, 2001b demonstrated that fertility control (tubal ligation and vasectomy) significantly reduced livestock depredation, without disruption to territory or mate fidelity.",

In addition to being effective and safe, drug induced alterations in socio-sexual behaviors is an important consideration, particularly in species with a complex social structure. The present study, therefore, was designed to examine what influence steroid hormone treatment might have on intra-pair interactions of a wild canid species. Coyotes represent a good candidate for contraceptive or contragestive regimens because, as previously stated, breeding is confined to a single annual opportunity. Also, both alpha male and female defend their mates during the breeding season; thereby prohibiting access to their mates by same-sex competitors while suppressing mating among subordinate pack members. Keeping a pack intact would also help maintain social stability within the local population (Bromley and Gese, 2001a, Gese, 2001).",

On several occasions observers confirmed that a male had regurgitated. In other cases, because of an animal's orientation, it was not possible to see food expelled but the female abruptly stopped begging and appeared to consume something (presumably regurgitate) off the ground where the male had been. Sometimes the males moved away, attempting to evade their mate's mouth-licking, but reprimands were rare. The earliest event of begging was observed on day 6 post-ovulation between a treatment pair that copulated but did not become pregnant. Begging was subsequently witnessed among other coyote pairs (pregnant and non-pregnant) throughout the following weeks, but termination of regular data collection precluded documentation after week 8.",

For example, during Protocol 1, one female experienced a split-estrus, copulating only on day 1 and day 6 post-ovulation, but had a healthy litter of four pups. Ironically, this same female failed to become pregnant in Protocol 2 although she copulated almost daily (day 0 through day 8, except day 5) during and after treatment.",

For example, plasma samples from the sole pregnant female in Protocol 2 yielded unusual relaxin results. In previous years, >90% of pregnant coyotes tested positive for relaxin by day 27 post-ovulation, yet the first sample taken from this female on day 28 was negative. The next sample collected on day 42 (although positive) had a weaker response pattern than expected and more typical of results observed on day 32. We speculate that in this particular case blastocyst(s) development may have been retarded; either because of adverse changes in oviducal fluid, or through a more direct embryotoxic effect of estradiol (Kennelly, 1969, J\u00f6chle et al., 1975, Tsutsui et al., 2006). But with embryonic demise incomplete, a placenta (the site of relaxin synthesis in canines) could, nevertheless, have been established (Tsutsui et al., 2006). Subsequent normal development of the placenta and/or fetus, however, was compromised because the pregnancy ultimately failed and pups were never seen.",

Interruption of sexual activity (split-estrus) may be attributed to the iatrogenic estradiol surge (because most of the females had a suppression of mounts and ties). But the greater incidence of extended estrus (which occurred in 3 of 6 non-pregnant females as well as the failed pregnancy case described above) cannot be adequately explained in the present study; although it would be consistent with the domestic dog model to presume that re-emergence of sexual activity was linked to estradiol withdrawal and normalization of the estradiol:progesterone ratio (Concannon et al., 1979, Chakraborty et al., 1980). Such a rebound effect, however, would only be outstanding if outside the established range for a normal estrus (i.e., >10 days post-ovulation). Otherwise, a rebound occurring during the expected estrus time-frame might go unnoticed. Unfortunately, the frequency, duration, and resolution of the hormone data collected were inadequate for a retrospective analysis of such a rebound effect.",

Even without pups, perpetuation of the pair-bond would benefit the reproductive fitness of free-roaming coyotes.
