For sake of clarity, the embryo is defined as the part of the conceptus that gives rise to the neonate, from fertilization to completion of organogenesis (Day 42 of pregnancy in cattle). Furthermore, the fetus is defined as that part of the conceptus that gives rise to the live neonate from completion of organogenesis to completion of the second stage of parturition. Although more deaths occur at and around birth than between 1 week of age and weaning, embryonic losses are usually higher than perinatal losses. Notably, maternal infections during pregnancy may or may not impact fetal development. The impact on fetal development may be caused directly by infectious agents or their toxins, or indirectly by placentitis. Furthermore, detection of a reproductive pathogen should not preclude further diagnostic testing, as dual infections are not uncommon.",

Factors that impact the outcome of embryonic and fetal death include gestational age, cause of death, and source of progesterone for pregnancy maintenance (Table 1\n). Aborted fetuses may be autolytic due to death 24\u201348 h before abortion. Fetal mummification occurs most commonly in polytocous species (e.g. swine). Bacterial infections are usually not involved in mummification; however, viruses are a common cause of mummification in pigs, dogs, and cats. Fetal maceration results when abortion or parturition fails to occur following fetal death and CL regression (occasionally in bovine trichomoniasis and vibriosis). The majority of abortions are not epizootic but sporadic, with <5% of pregnant animals in a group aborting. Severe maternal illness resulting in high fever (e.g. mastitis, pneumonia), hypoxia (e.g. anaplasmosis, severe anemia), or endotoxemia may result in abortion. Although very few lesions are pathognomonic, gross fetal lesions may be characteristic for mycotic abortion (fresh dysmature fetus with dermatitis) and epizootic bovine abortion (fresh fetus with a nodular liver).",

As well, Streptococcus zooepidemicus can cause abortion via ascension through the cervix and infection of the fetus and placenta, or possibly through a maternal systemic infection [62], [63]. Bacterial abortions usually occur at 5\u201310 months of gestation [62]. In addition to bacterial culture, diagnosis of infection is coupled with evidence of autolysis and inflammation of the fetus and placenta. Other bacteria implicated in infertility or abortion are E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae var genitalium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Leptospira spp., S. abortus equi, and nocardioform actinomycetes. Although no longer very common, S. abortus equi has caused abortion outbreaks [64]; in one of these, 21 of 26 mares aborted between 5 and 10 months of gestation [64].",
