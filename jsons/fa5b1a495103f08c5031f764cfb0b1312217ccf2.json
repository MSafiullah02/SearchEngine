[28] [29] [30] Under resting conditions, approximately 80% of the blood flow in the feline small intestinal wall is distributed to the mucosa-submucosa and 20% to the muscularis-serosa. [30] [31] [32] In particular, all of the main and large anastomotic vessels (30-80 mm in diameter) are located in the submucosal layer, whereas a plexus of smaller vessels is embedded in the muscularis mucosae. 30 The mucosal arteries divide in a stellate manner into branches which are ramified in the mucosal layer. Each villus is usually supplied by a single arterial vessel that runs in the central villous core. Close to the villous tip, the central vessel arborizes into a dense capillary network. The capillaries collect into veins at the villous base.
