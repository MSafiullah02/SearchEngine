With the geo-referenced coordinate data for the collecting localities of the mammalian hosts and the centroid coordinates of the geo-statistical locality polygons for the human records, we could investigate co-distribution as a point process. We followed Wheeler, Worden, and McLean (2016) and implemented a random relabelling permutation approach of the cross-K function. This method allows us to test whether there is a spatial patterning or association between wild mammal virus records and human viral cases. The cross-K function is the bivariate version of Ripley's K function and can be used to characterize point patterns and determine whether they are clustered, dispersed or randomly distributed (Dixon, 2002) . To test co-distribution under a realistic null hypothesis, we kept the point locations fixed, but randomly assigned each one to be either a wild mammal viral record or a human case under the same marginal frequencies. This test is appropriate for instances in which sampling is biased or uneven (Wheeler et al., 2016) . We called functions from the R packages spatstat (Baddeley, Turner, & Rubak, 2018) , sp and rgdal to run this test.",

This may be because most viral human cases were not fully confirmed and most of them were notified as unspecified viral fever or as unspecified arthropod-borne viral fever (Table S4) . Additionally, there are fundamental differences in how human cases and wildlife records are reported and sampled spatially. Despite known roadside bias in wild mammal sampling, wild mammal records are more likely to come from less urbanized landscapes than reports for human cases, which are tied more closely with health infrastructure in or close to human settlements. Our method for testing co-distribution accounts for distance and could potentially overcome these biases, but larger-scale simulation-based studies may be needed to accurately measure the sensitivity of this approach to sampling biases.

These represent 58.3% (7/12) of all mammalian orders present in Mexico. These results are in line with overall patterns of research effort in Mexico for mammalian orders, where bats, rodents and carnivores are the most studied groups. However, our results do not reflect the vast amount of research on white-tailed deer in the country. When analysing the database, we found that Rhabdoviridae and Togaviridae are the two most recorded viral families found in the 85.7% (6/7) of the Mexican mammalian orders with data available, since Rabies lyssavirus (Rhabdoviridae) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Togaviridae) were the most common species recorded in Mexico (see: Colunga-Salas et al., 2019). In contrast, seven viral families were restricted to a single mammalian order (for Rodentia: Arenaviridae and Hantaviridae; for Chiroptera: Coronaviridae and Paramyxoviridae; for Artiodactyla: Hepeviridae; and for Cetacea: Herpesviridae) representing the 50% (6/12) of all viral families (Figure 3). The most frequently reported techniques for viral exposure were serological tests (37 studies of the 52 obtained = 71%), such as ELISA, fluorescent antibody tests and haemagglutination-inhibition tests, followed by molecular techniques [e.g. PCR and RFLP] (22/52 = 42%); meanwhile, other techniques (isolation, electron microscopy and Seller's method) were used much less frequently (6/52 = 12%). It is noteworthy that only in three studies, the method used was not specified (Figure S1). Geographically, the states with the highest incidence rate (per 100 mammalian species) of viral species associated with wild mammals were Mexico City (53.96), Coahuila (48.59) and Baja California (31.25). The states with the lowest rate were Quintana Roo (1.21), Oaxaca (1.04) and Nayarit (1.03). Meanwhile, the states with no reports were Quer\u00e9taro, Tabasco and Tlaxcala (Figures 4 and 6a; Table S3). If we consider the richness of potential viral zoonotic species, the states with the highest number of species are Campeche with 10 viral species and Mexico City with seven species. The states with the lowest number of potential zoonotic viral species correspond to those with the fewest records (Aguascalientes, Nayarit and Quintana Roo), with only one viral species recorded. The geographic distribution of studies and records does not follow known patterns of research effort related to species diversity nor species richness. Other abiotic factors may be involved, such as population size, funds and the number of research centres. For example, Mexico City is not particularly rich in mammals, but it is the capital and the venue for several major research institutions and other public health infrastructure (e.g. the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos [InDRE]). The reasons for the high incidence rate in wild mammal-associated virus research records for Baja California Sur could be the low mammalian diversity related to its area, and the bias as a result of the very high sampling and capture effort made in the respective works, as in the case of Coahuila (see Colunga-Salas et al., 2019). Regarding viral zoonotic human cases, during the period of 2000-2013, 198 confirmed cases were registered in 29 states (Mexico City,Quer\u00e9taro and Tlaxcala were the only three states that never reported cases). Regarding the incidence rate per (1,000,000 inhabitants), the states with the highest rate of reported zoonotic cases were Nuevo Leon (10.91), followed by Colima (5.01), Quintana Roo (4.43) andSonora [3.96]",
