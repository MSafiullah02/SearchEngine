Fourteen HPeV genotypes have been described worldwide [Ito et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2005; Benschop et al., 2006a, 2008; Al\u2010Sunaidi et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Calvert et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010]. Clinical manifestations of HPeV infection including gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neurologic syndrome. HPeV1 and 2 have been associated with mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections [Abed and Boivin, 2006; Harvala et al., 2008; Harvala and Simmonds, 2009] and, in rare cases, with necrotizing enterocolitis [Birenbaum et al., 1997]. HPeV3 has been associated with sepsis\u2010like illness, severe neurologic manifestations [Ito et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2005], and infant death [Levorson et al., 2009; Sedmak et al., 2010]. Although HPeV genotypes 4\u201314 were identified in a number of different countries, their clinical role remains to be clarified [Benschop et al., 2006a, 2008; Al\u2010Sunaidi et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Calvert et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010]. On the other hand, HPeVs are not included usually in diagnostic panels, thus, the HPeV infection rate might be underestimated.",

In our series, five patients <1 month of age with sepsis\u2010like illness were infected with HPeV3. In three of these patients, multiple samples (plasma, stool, CSF, or respiratory sample) were HPeV\u2010positive. These findings support the hypothesis of a disseminated infection caused by HPeV3 [Pi\u0148eiro et al., 2010; Sedmak et al., 2010]. The detection of HPeV in different biologic specimens from patients with sepsis\u2010like illness may help to clarify the extent of the infection. On the other hand, none of patients with neurologic syndromes in the absence of sepsis\u2010like illness was positive for HPeV, thus suggesting that HPeV neurotropism might be limited to specific clinical conditions. In keeping with other reports [Benschop et al., 2006b, 2008; van der Sanden et al., 2008], the majority of HPeV infections in our study were observed in the fall season.",
