Often, small changes in protein composition or environment can tip the balance from one arrangement to the next, with some proteins coexisting in more than one oligomeric state. A classic example of alternate oligomers is the Bence-Jones protein, characterized by X-ray diffraction more than 40 years ago. This protein exists in the crystal in three quaternary structures7 that vary in their domain interactions.",

This is clearly the case in staphylococcal nuclease.65 The only sequence difference between the monomer and the domain-swapped dimer is the loop length, with the monomer loop containing six more residues than the hinge in the dimer. Loop residue deletion has also been used in some designed proteins. An elegant example illustrating the importance of loop length is provided by two different three-helix bundles that were engineered in the Eisenberg laboratory.88 Loop deletion in one of these caused the formation of a domain-swapped dimer, whereas loop deletion in the other resulted in fibril formation. On the other hand, Perutz and colleagues found that adding a stretch of polyglutamines into the active site loop of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 caused domain swapping and higher order oligomer formation.89 Indeed, in this case, oligomerization increased with increasing loop lengths. Therefore, a universal statement regarding the influence of hinge loop length cannot currently be made.",

Glycine can adopt phi and psi angles in all four quadrants of the Ramachandran plot due to the lack of a side chain; therefore, it is possible to accommodate a glycine in any kind of turn, even quite sharp ones, which are sterically forbidden for other residues.

Indeed, replacement of the first proline in the hinge with an alanine stabilized the monomer form, whereas the same substitution of the second proline stabilized the dimer form. Rousseau et al. suggested that tension in the hinge loop in the monomer caused it to behave like a loaded molecular spring that is released when the alternative conformation is adopted in the dimer.91 Unlike in suc1, mutation of the single proline in the hinge loop of CV-N to glycine substantially stabilized both states of the protein, with greater stabilization of the monomer compared to the dimer.92 Furthermore, adding a second proline residue by mutating a neighboring amino acid caused the domain-swapped dimer to become the thermodynamically most stable state.92 Similarly, the change of alanine in the hinge loop of the forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) to proline prevented the formation of the swapped dimer.20 This suggests that the addition or deletion of prolines creates no uniform outcome and that each protein may have its unique signature of hinge loop residues.",

Compared to wild-type monomeric GB1, the domain-swapped dimer comprises four mutations \u2013 L5V, F30V, Y33F, and A34F \u2013 none of which are located in the hinge region.56 A theoretical analysis of the quadruple mutant and wild-type GB1 from Wodak's group96 suggested different effects caused by each change: L5V introduces general destabilization due to unfavorable interactions with its surrounding residues; F30V induces local strain due to a clash with its own backbone; and A34F not only destabilizes the monomer conformation by forcing W43 to adopt a strained side chain conformation, and therefore disrupts the hydrophobic core of GB1, but also stabilizes the swapped dimer by tightly packing its side chains from both subunits against each other in the dimer core. The importance of the individual mutated residues (L5V/F30V/Y33F/A34F) in the integrity of the domain-swapped structure was also investigated by modeling and mutagenesis.56 Inspection of the dimer structure suggested that the shorter mutant side chains of the L5V and F30V variants could easily be accommodated within the core, although possibly causing some destabilization of the structure. Indeed, each change is tolerated within the wild-type structure. The Y33F mutation represents a conservative change, and either side chain can substitute for the other in the respective cores. The position of F34 in the domain-swapped dimer appeared to be most crucial. This was verified experimentally: Reverting F34 in the amino acid sequence of the domain-swapped dimer mutant back to the wild-type alanine residue resulted in a monomeric protein with a very similar structure as that of wild-type GB1.56\n",

Several groups are applying these methodologies to domain swapping. Movement of the polypeptide chain by Brownian motion through a funneled energy landscape with structure formation dominated by native stability104 is the most elegant and widely accepted protein folding concept. This concept has also been applied to protein associations in domain-swapped multimers. In particular, Onuchic et al.105 have used a symmetrized Go-type potential to simulate domain swapping in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (Eps8) SH3 dimer, they discovered a frustrated hinge region and suggested the following most favorable path for domain swapping: native monomers\u2192partially folded monomers\u2192unfolded monomers\u2192open-end domain-swapped dimers\u2192domain-swapped dimers. Onuchic et al. suggested that the overall monomeric topology, rather than local signals in the hinge region, determines where in the polypeptide chain domain swapping will occur.105 Although plausible, it appears at odds with some experimental results. For instance, in GB1 and LB1 (protein L B1 domain), proteins with identical monomeric topologies, different domain-swapped dimers are observed, clearly at odds with expectations if topology plays the dominant role. Proteins with intrinsic symmetry of the sequence and/or structure are \u2018highly frustrated\u2019 in the language of these authors, and in their simulations multimode domain swapping was observed and necessitated the inclusion of inter- or intramolecular disulfide bonds.106 Two proteins that fall into the \u2018highly frustrated\u2019 category are the human prion protein (PrPC) and CV-N. However, at least for CV-N, the presence of disulfide bonds is not necessary for domain swapping because several homologs of CV-N with varying numbers of disulfide bonds appear to lack domain swapping,[107], [108] and no differences in disulfides were noted for the monomers or domain-swapped dimers.",

For each protein, hinge residues were defined by comparing backbone dihedral angles for the experimentally determined monomer and dimer structures (dihedral angle changes >60\u00b0 at the open interface). The motional behavior for all residues via the first slow modes from GNM were examined. GNM did not successfully distinguish hinge residues for our diverse set of domain-swapped proteins. Investigating the behavior of every residue, we found that the hinge residues are neither the most mobile nor the most rigid ones in some proteins. For that matter, taking the picture of a hinge literally, the actual hinge usually stays fixed, with the two objects that are connected by the hinge changing their relative positions. This would translate to relative rigidity of hinge residues and mobility at the edge of the hinge. On the other hand, hinge residues are often located in loops that are naturally more mobile than the cores of proteins, thereby allowing conformational changes to occur more easily.",

In this manner, increasingly more of the monomer chains are substituted for each other until a stable state is reached. Exchange initiated at one end, such as the C terminus, and did not involve unfolding. Conformational changes within the individual monomers and the binding between them were tightly coupled, and the total number of native contacts was maximized. In this process, a large number of hinge conformations and association modes are sampled by the intermediates, suggesting that the exchange reaction is nonspecific and the amino acid sequence plays only a minor role.

Among the alternative structures was a domain-swapped dimer in which one hairpin was exchanged between the subunits.56 The dimeric structure comprises an eight-stranded \u03b2 sheet made from four adjacent hairpins, resulting in two extensive new interfaces (Figure 5\n).

Half of the dimer, composed of the first \u03b2 hairpin and the \u03b1 helix from one polypeptide chain and the second \u03b2 hairpin from the other chain, is essentially identical to the monomer structure. The dimer dissociates into partially folded, monomeric species at low micromolar protein concentrations. The monomer is not a native, stable structure but, rather, a partially folded protein with extensive motions on the micro- to millisecond timescale. Despite these conformational fluctuations, the overall architecture of the monomer resembles that of wild-type GB1.

The first example was CV-N, originally isolated from an aqueous extract of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum. It inactivates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other enveloped viruses. The original solution structure of the 101-amino acid protein was a monomeric one,30 whereas in the subsequently determined X-ray structures, domain-swapped dimers were found (Figure 7\n).[31], [124] Either form predominates, depending on experimental conditions, and can be isolated for biophysical, structural, and functional studies.92 The monomer structure exhibits a compact, bilobal fold with pseudo-symmetry. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence repeats of CV-N do not constitute the structural repeats. Rather, the two symmetrically related domains are formed by portions from both sequence repeats. Each domain comprises a triple-stranded \u03b2 sheet with a \u03b2 hairpin packed on top, connected by a helical linker. This linker becomes the hinge in the domain-swapped dimer. In the dimer structure, the two pseudo-monomer halves contain the same interactions as were seen in the monomer. Biophysical studies revealed that the domain-swapped dimer is a kinetically trapped folding intermediate that converts into the slightly more stable monomeric form at physiological (>30 \u00b0C) temperatures. At low temperature (room temperature or lower), the dimer lifetime is sufficiently long for structural characterization in solution.92 The solution dimer structure is virtually identical in interdomain packing and overall folding to the structures in the trigonal and tetragonal crystals;[31], [124] only the relative domain-domain orientations of the pseudo-monomeric halves are distinct. In the solution dimer, hinge residues exhibit motions on the microsecond timescale, suggesting the possibility of reorientation around this hinge with different orientations being trapped in alternate crystal lattices.",

            "text": "Among all anti-HIV antibodies, very few neutralizing ones have been described. One of these is the human antibody 2G12, which neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 isolates. It binds to a cluster of high-mannose sugars on the \u2018silent\u2019 face of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. In the crystal structure of 2G12, two Fabs assembled into an interlocked dimer via domain swapping of their VH domains (Figure 8\n).130 Biochemical, biophysical, and mutagenesis data revealed that the productive form that recognizes glycosylated gp120 is indeed the swapped dimer. In the crystal structure of this antibody, the arrangement of the combining sites creates an extended surface for multivalent interaction with the carbohydrates. Such dimeric assembly has not been observed in any of the hundreds of Fab structures in the PDB. The VH domain exchange in 2G12 is associated with a twist of the variable regions relative to the constant region, although the individual variable (VH and VL) and constant domains (CH1 and CL) are very similar to those in other Fab molecules. The swapped dimer lacks the highly conserved \u2018ball-and-socket joint\u2019 between VH and CH1 that allows the variable domains to adjust their position relative to the constant domains, even though the required residues are present. The VH domains within the dimer are related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis (\u223c180\u00b0), with the two Fabs arranged side by side. This conformation places the combining sites approximately 35 \u00c5 apart but facing in the same direction. Analysis of the Fab 2G12 structure suggests three causes for domain swapping in this case. First, the conserved interaction between adjacent glutamines in the VH and VL domains is missing at the closed VH/VL interface. These glutamines usually hydrogen bond to each other at the base of antibody combining sites. In 2G12, however, this position is occupied by a rarely observed arginine. Second, the elbow region connecting the VH and CH1 domains that forms the hinge loop comprises an unusual sequence. Therefore, the VH domain pivots around P113, stabilizing a hydrophobic contact between proline and valine that aids in domain swapping. Third, a favorable open interface is created between VH/VH domains through an extensive hydrogen bonding and salt bridge network, comprising a total of 10 hydrogen bonds and 136 van der Waals interactions, as well as \u03c0-stacking interactions between several aromatic residues that create a substantial buried area.130\n",

In the crystallographic dimer, one polypeptide chain does not comprise a complete active site and therefore may be inactive.

Two such dimers come together and create a substructure (half of the tetramer) very similar to that seen in the dimer (Figure 14(c)).

Given that the polymeric form was crystallized in the presence of a significant amount of alcohol, its relevance to any physiological state is unclear.

The secreted protein binds heme in a 1:1 stoichiometry and transfers it its receptor HasR, which in turn releases it into the bacterium.157\nSerratia marcescens HasA is a 19-kDa protein whose monomer structure is composed of seven \u03b2 strands arranged into a central six-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet with a high degree of curvature. Four \u03b1 helices are packed on one side against this sheet, whereas a loop connecting strands \u03b25 and \u03b26 covers its hydrophobic other side. Two small 310 helices connect strand \u03b27 to helix \u03b12. The heme is held in a relatively solvent-exposed environment by two loops, one of which connects helix \u03b11 to strand \u03b22 and the other connects strands \u03b24 and \u03b25 at the interface of the predominately \u03b1 and \u03b2 regions of the molecule.158 In addition to the monomeric variant, a HasA dimer (DHasA) is also secreted in vivo, and its crystal structure revealed a domain-swapped dimer. The pseudo-monomeric portion of the structure is very similar to the isolated monomer structure (Figure 16\n). However, it appears to be less flexible, and the region around the heme binding pocket is almost inaccessible in the dimer.61 DHasA is not capable of transferring the heme to HasR because the appropriate productive HasA-HasR complex cannot be formed. Indeed, the regions involved in the interaction between HasA and HasR159 become partially inaccessible by dimerization in DHasA. However, the heme can be transferred from DHasA to a HasA monomer.61 Therefore, DHasA was proposed to constitute a heme reservoir, keeping it available for use by the Has system.61\n",

            "text": "Despite considerable efforts by numerous groups, no unifying molecular mechanism of domain swapping has emerged: Each protein seemingly behaves in a distinctive and individual manner, and a general explanation for how proteins exchange domains remains elusive. What seems to emerge is that domain swapping is closely associated with the unfolding/folding process of proteins. For some proteins, distinct intermediates \u2013 in which some hydrophobic part of the monomeric protein becomes exposed and, thereby, is available for interaction with a \u2018like\u2019 molecule \u2013 may play a role, whereas for others, complete unfolding may occur. The fact that high protein concentration and additives (always present during crystallization) promote domain swapping suggests a switch in solute-solvent interaction. For example, exposed hydrophobic regions may no longer undergo unfavorable interactions with the aqueous solvent but, rather, favorable ones with another polypeptide chain. In this manner, an oligomeric structure can be trapped in either a crystal or an aggregate. Such behavior may also occur in vivo under conditions in which monomer promoting factors are missing or high local protein concentrations are induced through compartmentalization or the action of protein-protein interaction modules.",
