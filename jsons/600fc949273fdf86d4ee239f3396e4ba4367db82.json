(2) This may admittedly be a biased group and circulating, asymptomatic cases may greatly dilute the paper's findings, especially since asymptomatic carriage in the paediatric age group may be even higher. (3, 4) For this reason, a correction factor of 15% and 5% symptomatic for overall and for paediatric respectively has been incorporated and the data for the worked example, Malta, revised in the following two tables. For all ages, including the paediatric population, the symptomatic proportion will vary, but the degree of variation is uncertain at the time of writing.",
