            "text": "It is well-known now that the viral disease caused by a new coronavirus named\n\u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19) provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning\nin China and affecting all countries worldwide. The acute respiratory disease caused by the\nvirus represents a serious public health issue. The World Health Organization raised the\nthreat by this epidemic to the \u201cvery high\u201d level, on February 28, 2020. The\nclassical hallmark symptoms of the disease reported for most of the infected patients include\nfever, cough, and shortness of breath, distinguishing COVID-19 from a cold or flu\nhyperthermia. Those signs do appear in many if not most of the severe cases. Although the\npathogenic agent is qualified as a virus with many unknowns, progressively accumulated data\nworldwide indicate other uncommon symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 like dermatological,\ngastrointestinal, and neurological issues. Many recently published papers reported on several\nclinical signs that could be classified as neurological alterations, supporting the ability of\nSARS-CoV-2 to attack human brain and also the eventuality of the involvement of the brain in\nthe physiopathology of SARS-Cov-2. The link between COVID-19 and neurological problems has not\nbeen fully determined, and several cases with neurological disorders have been cited and\ndiscussed in previous studies. The neurological signs associated with SARS-CoV-2 could be\ncategorized in two types. In the first group, studies documented hyponosmia/anosmia and\nhypogueusia/agueusia in COVID-19 patients mildly affected by the virus and, therefore, not\nrequiring respiratory assistance. This led many doctors in different countries to look for\nthese symptoms in people who otherwise are not extremely ill or are not ill. On the other\nside, neurological signs like mental confusion (loss of bearings, disturbance of alertness),\ndisturbance of higher functions, restlessness, or loss of consciousness have been principally\nreported in severe cases.1 Other neurological signs qualified as less\ncommon symptoms including headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have also\nbeen reported. Patients with digestive symptoms had a longer time from symptom onset to\nhospital admission than patients without digestive symptoms. Nausea and vomiting symptoms\ncould be of high interest as they suggest disturbances in the central regulation of food\nintake and also the impairment of the brain structure involved in the control of vomiting and\nnausea. Loss of appetite has also been shown to occur at earlier stages of infection.2 Interestingly, both structures belong to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) located\nin the medulla oblongata, the lowest region of the brainstem that controls several autonomic\nactivities, including the heart, breathing, and food intake. Thus, injuries of this specific\nregion of the brainstem could be detrimental for the maintenance of homeostasis. In the DVC,\nthe nucleus of tractus solitarii (NTS) is known besides the hypothalamus (the classical brain\ncenter involved in food intake: FI control) to be a key area involved in the regulation of FI.\nWe documented already on the eventual involvement of this nucleus and principally its\nsubnucleus, i.e., the genatinous nucleus in the respiratory failure, in severe cases based on\nour previous observations in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with neurochemical alteration\nof the catecholaminergic system.3 Thus, the impairment of one discrete\nstructure in the NTS could lead to significant functional alterations. Interestingly, the\ngelatinous nucleus is also known to be involved in food intake control.4\nThe loss of appetite means that the crosstalk between the hypothalamus and DVC has been broken\nas in pathological states like stress as we reported previously,5 which\ncould be induced by the presence of the virus (or viral particles) in one or both brain areas.\nThis presence is expected to affect negatively the orexigenic/anorexigenic neuropeptide\nsignaling and by consequence will lead to an anorexia-like state explaining this appetite\nloss.",

            "text": "Concerning nausea and vomiting symptoms, it is well established that another component of the\nDVC plays a crucial role in elicitation of this symptom, i.e., the area postrema (AP) lying\nbeneath the fourth cerebral ventricle. This structure has been classified as the\n\u201cemetic chemoreceptor trigger zone\u201d as its destruction abolished the emetic\nresponse to cardiac glycosides (for review, see ref (6)). The neurocircuits also encompass the two other structures of the DVC, NTS and dorsal\nmotor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV). The presence of the virus in these DVC structures and\nprincipally in AP could elicit the two previously cited signs. Furthermore, the presence of\nACE2 receptors, to which SARS-CoV-2 binds, in these brainstem regions is in favor of this\naction. But at this stage, the remaining question is how does SARS-CoV-2 reach this brain\nregion? Some authors report on the possibility of the virus to enter the brain via the\nnasopharyngeal epithelium. By taking the path of the olfactory nerve, the virus reaches the\nolfactory bulb and spreads further to other parts. This hypothesis is supported by the\nneurotropism of the virus in analogy to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS viruses. Neurotropism could also\noccur at the level of the vagus nerve that terminates in the DVC in the brainstem where MERS\nand SARS virus deposits have been reported in intranasally inoculated mice. In this case too,\nit is not excluded that the high load of virus in the airways could also contribute to its\npassage via the vagus nerve as this connects the DVC to the lungs (Figure\n1). Another possibility is that the virus could\n\u201cnavigate\u201d to the brain via the general circulation and could pass through the\nblood-brain barrier (BBB), responsible for protecting the brain against infections. Indeed,\nthe presence of pleomorphic spherical viral-like particles has been reported individually and\nin small vesicles of endothelial cells of the BBB in the postmortem brain of a COVID-19\npatient. However, one cannot exclude the passage of the virus to reach directly via blood the\nDVC without crossing the BBB at the level of the AP (in the case of the DVC in brainstem) and\nmedian eminence (in the case of hypothalamus); both are circumventricular organs where the BBB\nis lacking (Figure 1). In summary, the potential role\nof autonomic brain control in the management of some physiopathological aspects observed in\nCOVID-19 patients has been discussed notably in relation to appetite loss and nausea/vomiting\nsigns. We also hope that our contribution can encourage neuroscientists to deeply explore the\nhypotheses given in this contribution for further elucidation of the link between the brain\nand neurological signs observed in SARS-CoV-1 infected patients.",
