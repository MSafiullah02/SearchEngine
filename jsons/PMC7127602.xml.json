Mpro, a highly conserved proteinase among coronaviruses, is responsible for the majority of the proteolytic processing of two large viral polyproteins, replicases pp1a and pp1ab. All of the cleavage products from these replicases are required for the assembly of membranous complexes in infected cells where the viral RNA genome is replicated. Interruption of either viral RNA translation or polyprotein proteolytic processing abolishes viral RNA replication.6, 7 Because the indispensable involvement in polyprotein processing of SARS-CoV Mpro is upstream of many replicative events in the viral life cycle, reducing or blocking the peptidase function of Mpro could have a profound impact on lowering progeny virus yield and enhancing cell survival. Therefore, SARS-CoV Mpro is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs.8\n",

Domains I and II are made of \u03b2-barrel motifs similar to the domains in the chymotrypsin-type serine proteases and in the 3C proteinases of picornaviruses. The substrate binding sites, and the nearby catalytic dyad consisting of residues Cys145 and His41, are located in a cleft between domains I and II. Domain III contains five \u03b1-helices connected to domain II via an extended loop (residues 185\u2013200); it plays an essential role for the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV Mpro by maintaining the proper conformation of the dimer.9, 10, 11\n",

Some of these compounds showed significant improvement over MAC-5576 in their inhibitory activity.34 In this paper, we report the in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro by a series of non-peptidic compounds designed on the basis of MAC-5576 (Table 1, Table 2\n) and analyze the possible modes of interaction between this new class of non-peptidyl inhibitors and SARS-CoV Mpro using molecular docking tools. Our docking results also allow us to put forward constructive suggestions for the future design of anti-SARS Mpro inhibitors.",

Interestingly, the positions of the electron-withdrawing substituents on their terminal aromatic rings seem to influence the inhibitory efficacy of these compounds dramatically. For example, the difference in the position of the nitrogen atom of the pyridine moiety relative to the carbonyl function in compounds 6 and 7 is associated with a fourfold disparity in their IC50 values. The best group I inhibitors, compounds 1\u20133, contain either a chloride or a nitro group at the para position relative to the furan function. Moving the nitro group of compound 2 to either the ortho (compound 4) or the meta (compound 5) position led to a threefold and eightfold increase in their IC50 values, respectively. In a similar manner to compounds 2, 4, and 5, compounds 8\u201310 of group II bear a chloro- or a nitro-substituent on the benzene ring directly connected to the central ester function at the para, ortho, and meta position relative to the ester bond, respectively. The position of the substituents in the latter three compounds has much less of an impact on the inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV Mpro, although the meta-substituted compound 10 is a markedly weaker inhibitor than either of compounds 8 and 9. Compounds 11 and 12, having terminal conjugated rings, showed inhibitory activities roughly equivalent to those of the best group I compounds.",

The first binding mode (the S2\u2013S1 mode) of the group I compounds occupies primarily the volume extending from the S2 to the S1 substrate binding sites (Fig. 1\na). Figure 1b shows the predicted interactions between the enzyme and compound 1 in the active site as an example. The chloropyridine moieties of these inhibitors bind inside the S1 pocket in an orientation wherein the pyridine plane is parallel to the two \u2018walls\u2019 of the S1 sites formed by residues Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Ser144, and residues Glu166, His172, respectively. In the docked complexes of compounds 1, 2, and 5, the common nitrogen atom of the chloropyridine moieties receives a hydrogen bond from N\u03b52 of His163, which is the P1 specificity-determining residue (Fig. 1b). Similarly, the furan moieties of group I inhibitors occupy the same volume between the S1 and S2 pockets and form a few van der Waals interactions with Met165 (not shown). In contrast, the benzene rings of the group I inhibitors in the S2\u2013S1 mode show relatively larger conformational variations. Compounds 1 and 2, which contain para-substituted benzene rings, can fit into the S2 pocket well. Compounds 3\u20135 all contain ortho- or meta-orienting groups on their benzene rings. This causes the benzene moieties in these compounds to be pushed outward from S2 site so as to avoid steric hindrance between the benzyl substituents and the side chains of His41 and Met49. The docking models suggest that hydrophobic interactions are formed between residues His41, Met49, and Gln189 and the benzene ring moieties, whereas the main chain NH of Gln189 forms a hydrogen bond with the ortho-orienting nitro substituent on the benzene rings.",

Esters are known substrates for chymotrypsin-type serine proteases, enzymes that are structurally similar to the catalytic domains of SARS-CoV Mpro.

In a similar fashion to the S2\u2013S1 binding mode, the chloropyridine moieties of group I inhibitors are also located in the S1 pocket. However, the orientations of the chloropyridine rings are roughly perpendicular to those of the chloropyridine rings in the S2\u2013S1 binding mode. The planes of the rings are parallel to the \u2018floor\u2019 of the S1 site formed by the side chains of His163 and His172. The m-chlorine on the pyridine ring points into the solvent channel at the back side of the S1 pocket, occupying a volume very close to that of a chloride ion observed in the crystal structure of an unliganded SARS-CoV Mpro\n35 (PDB code 2A5A). In the docked complexes containing compounds 1, 4, and 5, this chlorine is hydrogen bonded to O\u03b3 of Ser144 (Fig. 2b). Residues Cys145 and Met165 form hydrophobic interactions with the pyridine rings of these inhibitors. The furan rings in the S4\u2013S1 binding mode are situated on top of Met165 and Glu166, making a few van der Waals interactions with these residues. The S4 pocket is large enough to accommodate the benzene rings of the group I inhibitors despite the presence of various substituents at different positions on the rings. Residues Met165, Glu166, Leu167, and Gln189 contribute mostly hydrophobic interactions with the benzene rings. The main chain NH of Glu166 forms two hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom on the furan and the carbonyl oxygen at the \u03b2-position of the central ester bond of group I compounds. In addition, the nitro function of compound 5 forms a hydrogen bond with N\u03b52 of Gln192 (Fig. 2b). In the S4\u2013S1 binding mode, the distances between the carbonyl carbons of the ester functions of the inhibitors and S\u03b3 of Cys145 range from 6.5 to 7.2 \u00c5 (Table 1 column 8). The inhibitors bound in this mode are very unlikely to be attacked by the sulfur nucleophile of Cys145 due to this long distance constraint. Therefore, the S4\u2013S1 binding mode likely represents a mechanism of competitive inhibition in which the inhibitors block the activity of SARS-CoV Mpro by denying entry of substrates into the active site. Most significantly, this binding hypothesis suggests a way to improve the design of more potent non-covalent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors that promote tighter S4\u2013S1 binding (discussed in later section).",

For group I compounds, there are no significant differences in the binding free energies between the S2\u2013S1 mode (\u0394G 1st) and the S4\u2013S1 binding mode (\u0394G 2nd) (Table 1). This suggests that group I compounds have comparable tendencies to adopt either the S4\u2013S1 or the S2\u2013S1 conformation prior to their possible covalent modification of SARS-CoV Mpro enzyme. The binding free energies for group II compounds are significantly higher than those of group I compounds, with the exception of compounds 11 and 12. This is in agreement with the general trend that SARS-CoV Mpro is more strongly inhibited by group I than group II compounds. Compounds 11 and 12 show binding free energies closer to those exhibited by the group I compounds, probably because the larger aromatic stabilization effects of the naphthalene moiety of compound 11 and the coumarin moiety of compound 12 make their central ester bonds less susceptible to nucleophilic attack by S\u03b3 of Cys145.

Our docking results clearly show that the 3-chloropyridine moieties of the ester-based non-peptidyl inhibitors have a strong propensity to enter the S1 specificity pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro. Accordingly, the residues forming the S1 pocket play a major part in the interactions between the inhibitors and SARS-CoV Mpro. This is significant, as the chloropyridine function does not resemble the cognate P1-Gln residue in terms of chemical properties. Consequently, some interactions between SARS-CoV Mpro and chloropyridine moiety likely differ from those between P1-Gln and SARS-CoV Mpro. Further derivatization of the chloropyridine group has yielded only marginal improvement on the efficacy of the resultant inhibitors, indicating that our design may have its maximal potential concerning the S1 pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro. Since the S1 pockets of all coronaviral Mpro are structurally conserved and are similar to those of the picornaviral 3Cpro, the inhibitors described in this study or at least their basic designs should prove useful in developing wide-spectrum antiviral compounds. An early indication of that came from the observation that the parent compound MAC-5576 showed very good inhibitory activity against both the SARS-CoV Mpro and the HAV 3Cpro with corresponding IC50 values in the high nanomolar range.22\n",

Met165 and Glu166 form the \u2018wall\u2019 of the S2 pocket opposite to that of His41; these residues are also major contributors of hydrophobic interactions in the S4\u2013S1 and the Cys-S1 binding modes (Table 4, Table 5\n).",

It is worth mentioning that the model structure used in docking is that of a SARS-CoV Mpro covalently modified at S\u03b3 of Cys145. The position of the nucleophilic sulfur atom, relative to the other active site residues, has shifted significantly from that of S\u03b3 in the unliganded enzyme structures (PDB codes, e.g., 1UK4 or 2A5A) (Fig. 4\na). Our recent X-ray crystallographic analyses of SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with some peptidyl inhibitors indicate that the formation of tetrahedral intermediates during substrate hydrolysis can take place without the requirement of the previously observed conformational changes in Cys145.37 Consequently, we aligned the 1UK4 structure onto the docking molecule 2A5K to obtain the alternate coordinates of the nucleophilic sulfur, which should represent the position of S\u03b3 in its resting state and when the substrate/inhibitor first approaches. The distances involving S\u03b3 of Cys145 were recalculated. It is clear that the carbonyl carbon atoms of the group II compounds are closer to S\u03b3 of Cys145 than those of the group I compounds (Table 2 column 6). Note that some of the calculated distances (for group II compounds and for compounds 3 and 4 in the S2\u2013S1 binding mode) are shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of carbonyl oxygen and thiol sulfur atoms, suggesting a strong propensity for the covalent attachment of these inhibitors to S\u03b3 of Cys145.",

It suggests that a chloropyridine function in the context of an ester compound specifically binds to the S1 substrate binding site of SARS-CoV Mpro. The interactions between the S1 site of SARS-CoV Mpro and the chloropyridine functions likely play an important role in the initial binding of our inhibitors to the enzyme in vitro, whereas the rate of subsequent water-mediated hydrolysis of the resultant acyl enzyme depends on the chemical properties of the leaving groups on the carbonyl side of the ester bond. It is worth mentioning that additional docking studies indicate that the chloropyridine function of these compounds likely targets the S1 site of HAV 3Cpro as well (data not shown). This correlates well with the high structural similarity in the active sites of SARS-CoV Mpro and HAV 3Cpro.",

Due to the hydrolyzability of the ester bonds in these compounds, their inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV Mpro is likely to involve a covalent attachment of the inhibitors to the nucleophilic cysteine Cys145. Further modifications (individually or in combination) on the basis of compound 1 may improve its efficacy of inhibition against SARS-CoV Mpro and/or other structurally similar viral proteinases.1.The ester bond could be replaced by other functional groups that react with Cys145. This should enhance the inhibitory effect of inhibitors more prone to take on the S2\u2013S1 or Cys\u2013S1 conformations. Possible candidates for the reactive function are: epoxides, Michael acceptors, and azides.2.Side chain improvement aimed at increasing the interactions between the S2 or S4 sites and the inhibitor would create a mode of inhibition by virtually denying the entry of peptidyl substrates. A bifurcated modification diverging at the furan ring could, in principle, involve both the S2 and S4 sites in the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme, thereby maximizing their interactions.\n",

The conformations of the S2 and S4 pockets clearly showed structural variations among these structures (Fig. 4a, for clarity, only two models were overlaid). The depths of the S2 and S4 pockets could affect docking results dramatically simply because larger inhibitors will not be docked into the smaller pockets. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with an aza-peptide epoxide (APE)35 (PDB code: 2A5K, chain A) was chosen to construct the predictive model for this series of inhibitors. The benzene rings in the P2 and P4 positions of APE were accommodated cozily in the S2 and S4 pockets as a result of the relatively larger size of these pockets in available crystal structures of SARS-CoV Mpro (Fig. 4a and b). Therefore, using this structure of the enzyme is, in principle, to allow the inhibitors to adopt conformations that would maximize the interactions between the inhibitors and the S2 and S4 sites of the enzyme. The coordinates of the inhibitor, APE and the solvent molecules were first removed from the corresponding PDB file. Then essential hydrogen atoms and Kollman united atom charges were added to the protein structure using the molecular modeling software, Sybyl version 7.1 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, USA). Fragmental volumes and atomic solvation parameters that are important for computing the binding free energies were assigned using the ADDSOL module of the AutoDock36 program.",
