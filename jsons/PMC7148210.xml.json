Our method, Inductive Document Network Embedding (IDNE), is able to produce representations for previously unseen documents, without network information;we quantitatively assess the performance of IDNE on several networks and show that our method performs better than recent methods in various settings, including when new documents, not part of the network, are inductively represented by the algorithms. To our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate this kind of inductive setting in the context of document network embedding;we qualitatively show that our model learns meaningful word and topic vectors and produces interpretable document representations.\n",

It learns several embeddings for a document according to its different contextual documents, represented by its neighbors in the network. The attention mechanism selects meaningful features from text information in pairs of documents that explain their relatedness in the graph. A similar approach is presented in [4] where the links between pairs of documents are predicted by computing the mutual contribution of their word embeddings.",

A key motivation behind our approach is to be able to predict a document\u2019s neighborhood given only its textual content. This allows our model to inductively produce embeddings for new documents for which no existing link is known. To that extend, Graph2Gauss is a similar approach. On the contrary, TADW and GVNR-t are not primarily designed for this purpose as they both learn one-hot embeddings for each node in the document network. Note that if some methods like GraphSage [10], SDNE [27] and GAE [13] also enable induction on new nodes, they cannot deal with nodes that have no known connection. Also, our approach differs from CANE since this latter needs the neighbors of a document to generate its representation. IDNE learns to produce a single interpretable vector for each document in the network. In the next section, we review recent works in attention mechanisms for natural language processing (NLP) that inspired the conception of our method.",

The classifier performs well on the representations we learned, achieving similar or better results than the baseline algorithms on Cora, Gaming and Travel Stack Exchange. However, regarding the New York Times network, GVNR-t and TADW have a slight advantage. Because of its high density, the links in this network are little informative which may explain the relative good scores of the LSA representations. We hypothesize that (1) TADW benefits from its input LSA features and that (2) GVNR-t benefits both from its random walk based matrix of node co-occurrences [20], which captures more precisely the proximities of the nodes in such dense network, and from the short length of the documents making the word embedding averaging efficient [1, 15].",

The document is the abstract of this paper whose weights are inductively calculated with IDNE previously trained on Cora. We compute its attention weights \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Z^i$$\\end{document} and associate each word k to the maximum value of its column \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Z^i_k$$\\end{document}. We then colorize and underline each word associated to the two most represented topics in the document, if its weight is higher than \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{1}{2}$$\\end{document}. We see that the major topic (green and single underline), that accounts for 32% of the weights, deals with the type of data, here document networks. The second topic (blue and double underline), which represents 18% of the weights, relates to text modeling, with words like \u201cinterpretable\u201d and \u201ctopics\u201d.",

We showed that IDNE performs state-of-the-art results on various network in different settings. Moreover, we showed that our attention mechanism provides an efficient way of interpreting the learned representations. In future work, we would like to study the effect of the sampling of the documents on the learned topics. In particular, the matrix \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta $$\\end{document} could capture other types of similarities between documents such as SimRank [11] which measures structural relatedness between nodes instead of proximities.
