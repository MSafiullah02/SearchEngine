            "text": "It is estimated that 100 million cases of viral pneumonia occur each year [1] . Recent reports suggest that the etiology of many of these may now be identified [2] [3] [4] using culture, serologic analysis, antigen identification, or newer molecular techniques [2] [3] [4] [5] ; however, the attribution of the pneumonia to viruses can be difficult because viruses may be found in respiratory secretions after aspiration from the upper airways or after asymptomatic viral shedding. Further, coinfection with 2 organisms may occur. Research will have to clarify the role of some of these agents, using techniques to demonstrate viral proliferation or viral components in lung parenchyma. Determination of high viral loads in respiratory specimens can be useful in this regard, but few studies have reported viral loads, and these may vary with the patients age, timing of the specimen, and the type of specimen. Standards for viral loads will need to be clarified. The following report summarizes the viruses that have been associated with pneumonia in adult patients.",

Louria et al. [7] were perhaps the first to clarify the nature of pneumonia during the influenza epidemic of 1957-1958. They separated primary influenzal pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia occurring in the wake of influenza and mixed viral-bacterial pneumonias. Louria et al. identified 6 adult patients they felt had pneumonia due to influenza virus on the basis of virus isolation or serologic criteria and absence of significant bacteriologic findings. Five of the 6 patients died. During the same epidemic, Martin et al. [8] identified 32 fatal cases of influenza, 29 of which occurred in patients aged \u226515 years. Eleven patients in this study were classified as having influenza without bacterial complications, including 4 with pneumonia or perihilar congestion. Oseasohn et al. [9] reported 33 fatal cases of Asian influenza, of which 9 were associated with \"sterile cultures\" and at least 1 involved apparent primary influenzal pneumonia, and Kaye et al. [10] described 3 cases attributed to influenza virus pneumonia.",

More than 80% of infections, including pneumonia, associated with these viruses occur in children, especially those <4 years old, but they account for 1%-7% of adult respiratory infections [32] . In military recruitment centers [33, 34] , febrile respiratory disease is common, and cases of pneumonia have been reported [35] . Pneumonia cases in recruits were milder, were preceded by upper respiratory tract symptoms, and included rales and rhonchi on auscultation, leukocyte counts that were not elevated, and infiltrates on chest radiographs that were patchy and irregular or reticular. Resolution occurred in all 12 military patients described by Bryant and Rhoads [35] . However, Dudding et al. [36] reported fatal outcomes for 3 other trainees with adenoviral pneumonia. Recent reports have included adults who were immunosuppressed and experienced disastrous consequences from adenoviral pneumonia [37] , but reports of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults have also been published, as reviewed by Clark et al. [38] . These authors found 19 articles reporting on 21 immunocompetent patients with adenoviral pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 40 years, and fever (90%), cough (81%), and dyspnea (71%) were frequent. The median leukocyte count was 7.7 cells/mm 3 , but 52% of patients were lymphopenic. The most common radiograph finding was bilateral interstitial markings. Pneumonia due to adenovirus has also been reported in closed populations of adults [39] . A strain of adenovirus first identified in Dutch military recruits in 1955 has become a predominant circulating serotype. Tate et al. [40] reported the occurrence of this serotype in a US Air Force training facility. Twenty-three of 551 infected trainees were hospitalized with pneumonia, and 1 died. Lewis et al. [41] described an outbreak of adenovirus serotype 14 among civilians in Oregon with a median age of 51.9 years. Of a total of 67 cases, 29 were hospitalized; 26 of the hospitalized patients had abnormal chest radiograph findings, of whom 10 (38%) had infiltrates involving >1 lobe. Eighteen patients required critical care, and 7 (18%) patients died. Similarly, Esposito et al. [42] reported an outbreak of adenovirus serotype 14 infection on an island in southeast Alaska. Among 32 cases of pneumonia (median age, 47.5 years), they found 18 confirmed and 3 probable cases due to serotype 14. Pneumonia in 10 patients progressed to severe disease, and 1 died.",
