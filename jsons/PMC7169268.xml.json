Consider the measurement problem in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, which is a case\u2013control study that has enrolled 9500 children from seven sites around the world. Pneumonia is a clinical syndrome that develops because of an infection of the lung tissue by bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria or fungi (Levine et al., 2012). The appropriate treatment and public health control measures vary by pathogen. Which pathogen is infecting the lung usually cannot be directly observed and must therefore be inferred from multiple peripheral measurements with differing error rates. The primary goals of the PERCH study are to integrate the multiple sources of data\nto attribute a particular case's lung infection to a pathogen andto estimate the prevalences of the aetiologic pathogens in a population of children that met clinical pneumonia definitions.\n",

The disease status is determined by clinical examination including chest X\u2010ray (Deloria\u2010Knoll et al., 2012). The known pneumonia status (case\u2013control) is directly caused by the presence or absence of a pathogen\u2010caused infection in the lung. For controls, the lung is known to be sterile and has no infection. For a child who has been clinically diagnosed with pneumonia, the pathogen causing the infection in the child's lung is the scientific target of interest. Among the candidate pathogens being tested, we assume that only one is the primary cause. Extensions to multiple pathogens are straightforward. Because, for most cases, it is not possible to sample the lung directly, we do not know with certainty which pathogen infected the lung, so we seek to infer the infection status on the basis of a series of laboratory measurements of specimens from various body fluids and body sources.",

A gold standard (GS) measurement is assumed to have both perfect sensitivity and perfect specificity. Lung aspirate data would have been GS. A silver standard (SS) measurement is assumed to have perfect specificity, but imperfect sensitivity. Culturing bacteria from blood samples (\u2018B\u2010cX\u2019) is an example of SS measurements in the PERCH study.

In the LCM framework, conditional distributions of measurements given latent status are specified. Then the marginal likelihoods of the multivariate measurements are maximized as a function of the disease prevalence, sensitivities and specificities. This framework has also been extended to infer ordinal latent status (Wang et al., 2011).",

Also, if GS measurements were available from the lung for some cases, their latent variable would be directly observed. As the latent state is known for a non\u2010trivial subset of the study population, we refer to this model as a partially latent class model (PLCM).",

For example, if we consider only the PERCH study BS data, we simultaneously observe the presence or absence of each member from a list of possible pathogens for each child. Even with additional control data, the larger number of latent categories of latent status leads to weak model identifiability as is discussed in more detail in Section 2.1\n",

Understanding the relative value of each level of measurements is important to invest resources into data collection (number of subjects, type of samples) and laboratory assays optimally. An important goal is therefore to estimate the relative information from each type of measurements about the population and individual aetiology distributions.",

They showed that GS data can make model estimates more robust to model misspecifications. We further quantify how much GS data would reduce the variance of model parameter estimates for design purposes. Also, they considered binary latent status and did not have available control data. Another related literature that uses both GS and BS data is on verbal autopsy in the setting where no complete vital registry system has been established in the community (King and Lu, 2008). Quite similar to the goal of inferring pneumonia aetiology from laboratory measurements, the goal of verbal autopsy is to infer the cause of death from a prespecified list by asking close family members questions about the presence or absence of several symptoms. King and Lu (2008) proposed to estimate the cause\u2010of\u2010death distribution in a community by using data on dichotomous symptoms and GS data from the hospital where the cause of death and symptoms are both recorded. However, their method involves non\u2010parametric models and requires a sizable sample of GS data, especially when the number of symptoms is large. In addition, a key difference between verbal autopsy and most infectious disease aetiology studies is that the verbal autopsy studies are by definition case only.",

For example, an LCM with four observed binary indicators and three latent classes is not identifiable despite providing 15 degrees of freedom to estimate 14 parameters (Goodman, 1974). In principle, the Bayesian framework avoids the non\u2010identifiability problem in LCMs by incorporating prior information about unidentified parameter subspaces (e.g. Garrett and Zeger (2000)). Many researchers point out that the posterior variance for non\u2010identifiable parameters does not decrease to 0 as the sample size approaches \u221e (e.g. Kadane (1975), Gustafson et al. (2001) and Gustafson (2005)).

Here we restrict attention to the scenario with only BS data for simplicity but similar arguments pertain to the BS plus SS scenario. The problem can be understood from the form of the positive measurement rates for pathogens among cases. In the PLCM likelihood for the BS data (only retaining components in equation (5) with superscripts BS), the positive rate for pathogen j is a convex combination of the TPR and FPR:(6)Pr(MijBS=1|\u03c0j,\u03b8jBS,\u03c8jBS)=\u03c0j\u03b8jBS+(1\u2212\u03c0j)\u03c8jBS,where the left\u2010hand side of this equation can be estimated by the observed positive rate of pathogen j among cases. Although the control data provide \u03c8jBS\u2010estimates, the two parameters \u03c0j and \u03b8jBS are not both identified. GS data, if available, identify \u03c0j and resolve the lack of identifiability. Otherwise, we need to incorporate prior scientific information on one of them, usually the TPR (\u03b8jBS). In the PERCH study, prior knowledge about \u03b8jBS is obtained from infectious disease and laboratory experts (Murdoch et al., 2012) based on vaccine probe studies (Cutts et al., 2005; Madhi et al., 2005). If the observed case positive rate is much higher than the rate in controls (\u03c8jBS), only large values of the TPR (\u03b8jBS) are supported by the data, making aetiology estimation more precise (Section 2.2).",

The final decisions regarding which pathogen to treat can then be based on p^i. In particular, the pathogen with largest posterior value might be selected. It is Bayes optimal under mean misclassification loss. Individual aetiology predictions described here generalize the positive or negative predictive value from single to multivariate binary measurements and can aid diagnosis of case subjects under other user\u2010specified misclassification loss functions.",

The triangle on the line is the model estimate of the case rate to compare with the observed value above it. As discussed in Section 2.1, the model\u2010based case rate is a linear combination of the FPR and TPR with mixing fraction equal to the estimated aetiology fraction.

The SS data are shown in a similar fashion to the right of the BS data. By definition, the FPR is 0.0% for SS measures and there are no control data.

Among the controls, there is evidence of a lack of fit for the most common BS pattern with only PNEU and HINF (Fig. S1 in the on\u2010line supplementary materials). Fewer cases with this pattern are observed than predicted under the PLCM. This lack of fit is probably due to associations of pathogen measurements in control subjects.

We find two large deviations among the cases: RSV with RHINO and RSV with HMPV. These are probably caused by strong seasonality in RSV that is out of phase with weaker seasonality in the other two. Otherwise, the number of standardized log\u2010odds\u2010ratios that are greater than 2 (eight out of 110) associations is only slightly larger than what is expected under the assumed model (six expected).",

The posterior distribution of the viral aetiologic fraction has mode around 70.0% with 95% credible interval (57.0%,79.2%).

The approach is to extend the PLCM to have K subclasses within each of the current disease classes. These subclasses can introduce correlation between the BS measurements given the true disease state. An interesting question concerns the bias\u2013variance trade\u2010off for different values of K. This idea follows previous work on the parallel factors decomposition of probability distribution for multivariate categorical data (Dunson and Xing, 2009).
