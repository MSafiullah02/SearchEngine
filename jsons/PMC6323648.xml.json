As the scientific evidence expanded, normative guidance on HIV treatment evolved, and in 2015, WHO recommended the initiation of ART for all people living with HIV, irrespective of disease stage, both for clinical benefit to the individual living with HIV and for the prevention benefits of successful viral suppression on onward transmission.58\n",

However, there are genuine risks to wholesale relinquishment of the exceptionalist approach to HIV. Notwithstanding the many criticisms of vertical health programmes, there is little dispute that HIV exceptionalism has worked, mobilising extraordinary new financial, technical, and human resources, uniting diverse stakeholders, focusing global attention on concrete results, driving and benefiting from scientific innovation, and engaging communities in far-reaching ways. Abandonment of an approach that has been groundbreaking in its success should not be done without a rigorous interrogation of the risks and benefits of mainstreaming the HIV response into national health systems.",

This approach has potential applicability to a host of health problems beyond blood-borne pathogens such as reducing alcohol-related problems, minimising road trauma, and preventing skin cancers. Harm reduction needs be seen as a core global health promotion strategy.",

Combined with access to medication-assisted therapy (MAT), NSPs continue to be the most effective strategy to reduce new HIV infections in people who inject drugs. Harm-reduction services have the added public health benefit of facilitating linkages to other HIV-related services, drug treatment, and primary health care. Harm reduction is increasingly being adopted in diverse settings, although large gaps in the scale and coverage of harm-reduction programmes limit the ability of many countries to halt HIV and HCV epidemics.115 The USA, long a leading proponent of the global war on drugs, appears poised to undertake a rapid expansion of MAT in response to a surge in opioid addiction, offering potential opportunities to alter the global discourse on harm reduction.",

Incremental progress has been made in reforming UN drug conventions to incorporate certain health and human rights considerations, but a wholesale paradigm shift in the global approach to drug use has yet to occur.116 Needed legal reforms (eg, decriminalisation, proportional sentencing, or diversion to health and social services for non-violent offenders) will not only facilitate greater access to health and social services for susceptible communities but also sharply reduce prison populations. Reductions in the prison population might free up resources for scaling up ART, drug treatment, and primary health care in prison settings and reduce the incidence and risk of infectious diseases. In pursuing locally tailored drug policy reform, nation states and states within nation states can help build a compelling evidence base that can guide and inform reform efforts, unlock new efficiencies in prison systems, and build new constituencies for drug policy reform. To transcend polarising political debates that have limited its support, harm reduction itself needs to expand and mainstream its ethos and more integrate its application beyond drug use across a wider spectrum of stakeholders and public health issues.",

As structural action to address NCDs requires action in multiple domains (eg, social protection, trade, agriculture, taxation and finance, agriculture, manufacturing, labour), it is important that health routinely be taken into account in policy development processes. Toward the goals of more integrated and universally accessible health systems and sustainable health for all, policy development should prioritise structural approaches that generate health benefits for diverse populations and health conditions. As prevention of NCDs involve substantial shifts in social norms and practices (eg, smoking and alcohol consumption, diet, indoor cooking practices), engagement of communities is essential.",

In many settings, treatment for substance use and HIV operate in silos, resulting in fragmented care and suboptimal clinical outcomes. Meaningful integration of services for people with substance use and HIV requires a health workforce that is culturally competent and professionally skilled to create clinical environments that promote service access, engagement, retention, and medical adherence.

Increased use of trained community health workers offers an important task-shifting strategy for rationalising health spending and bringing services closer to the communities that need them. Compensation and training costs for community health workers are much less than for higher-cadre health workers, and the availability of community health workers enables doctors and nurses to focus more time on the skills for which they are specially trained.192 Numerous models for community health workers are already in operation in diverse regions, including in high-income countries. Ideally, community health workers are drawn from the communities they serve, receive extensive training that enables them to diagnose and address multiple health conditions, and are compensated, supervised, and fully integrated into health systems. Integrating community health workers into health systems has been shown to increase immunisation rates, enhance access to diverse health services, and reduce childhood mortality.193, 194, 195\n",

An independent evaluation of PEPFAR found that the bilateral programme had increased national capacity for commodity forecasting, procurement, storage, distribution, and tracking.197 Beginning in 2013, the Global Fund began soliciting proposals not only for specific disease programmes but also for health-systems strengthening. Global Fund grants have underwritten a variety of activities to buttress procurement and supply management, including expanded warehousing capacity in Tanzania, digitising and streamlining supply logistics in Laos, and revising and updating of the essential medicines list in Cambodia (Shakarishvili G, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, personal communication). Despite these strategic investments, stock-outs of antiretroviral medicines remain a persistent problem in sub-Saharan Africa,198 especially with respect to new regimens.199 Weaknesses in procurement and supply management are not confined to Africa or to HIV medicines but instead represent a systemic challenge that demands high-level and sustained attention. For example, in the Mekong region, where a rapid surge in malaria resistance has caused global alarm, fake or substandard anti-malaria medicines are common.200 Maintaining separate disease-specific systems for procurement and supply chain management wastes money, reduces incentives for service integration within health systems and facilities, and siphons scarce funding away from needed systemic investments.",

The model estimates that if such a multidisease screening programme were introduced in 2018\u201328, and reached 10% of South African adults each year, the programme would diagnose 492 000 new HIV cases, 1\u00b721 million new diabetes cases, and 6\u00b735 million new hypertension cases. Expressed as a fraction of individuals screened, the proportion newly diagnosed is expected to be lowest in the case of HIV and highest in the case of hypertension (figure 14). The total number of new treated HIV, diabetes, and hypertension cases would be expected to increase by 197 000, 543 000, and 2\u00b71 million, respectively. As a result of the increase in HIV diagnosis and treatment rates, the incidence of adult HIV infection is expected to decrease by 3\u00b75% in 2018\u201328, which is equivalent to 69 000 infections averted.Panel 3Modelling HIV, diabetes, and hypertension screening in South AfricaThembisa is an integrated demographic and HIV model developed for South Africa. The process of calibrating the model to data on HIV prevalence, HIV diagnosis, and mortality has previously been described.206, 210 In this analysis, the prevalence of diabetes (defined as a concentration of HbA1c \u22656\u00b75%) and hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg, or current use of blood pressure medication) was estimated from the age-specific and sex-specific prevalences measured in the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES).205 Age-specific and sex-specific rates of diagnosis for diabetes and hypertension were estimated from the same source. The average annual proportion of the adult population (aged 15 years and older) screened was assumed to be to 10%.208, 209, 211, 212 This average proportion was scaled by age-specific and sex-specific adjustment factors based on similar screening programmes in Uganda.209 Uptake of screening was assumed to be independent of disease status and further assumed to be constant over the period from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2028. The proportion of newly-diagnosed individuals who linked to care and started treatment soon after diagnosis was set to 40% in the case of HIV,213 45% in the case of diabetes, and 33% in the case of hypertension.210 A more detailed description of the model is provided in the appendix, as are sensitivity analyses with lower programme coverage and lower sensitivity and specificity of screening for hypertension and diabetes.",

As is the case across sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya is experiencing an increasing burden of NCDs, which account for 27% of all deaths and 50% of hospital admissions.215 Much of this increase can be attributed to lack of screening and early detection of NCDs, which in turn leads to late diagnosis and poor treatment outcomes. For example, 56% of people in Kenya have never had their blood pressure measured, and only 22% of individuals with increased blood pressure or hypertension diagnosis report taking treatment.215 These enormous gaps in screening and treatment of NCDs are occurring in the context of an overwhelmed health system and an HIV epidemic that has yet to be brought under control.",

At baseline and in the absence of additional intervention, the incidence of HIV infection in Kenya is estimated to decrease by 13% in the next decade. The integration scenario models a gradual increase in HIV screening and coverage of ART over time, reaching a population-level coverage of 78% in 2028. This corresponds to an additional 4 117 912 person-years on ART in the next decade. With this intervention, the number of new HIV infections is projected to decrease by 44% by 2028, corresponding to 216 655 new infections and 244 374 AIDS deaths averted (figure 16\n). Sensitivity analyses of ART uptake suggested that even with only 40% treatment initiation, the integration scenario would reduce the incidence of HIV infection by 23%. Given the longer life expectancy of HIV-positive individuals receiving ART, the intervention results in only marginal improvements in HIV prevalence (1\u00b74% reduction by 2028), despite the substantial reductions in new infections.Panel 4Modelling scenario for integrated screening for HIV, hypertension, and diabetes in KenyaThe Spectrum package was used to explore the potential effect of a country-wide campaign to integrate screening for HIV, diabetes, and hypertension.Baseline ART coverage in 2016 was maintained at a fixed level from 2018 to 2028.Following the framework of project SEARCH,146 we modelled a joint community-outreach campaign for HIV and NCDs screening in the next decade (2018\u201328). We assumed that each year, a geographically distinct area of Kenya comprising 10% of the population would receive the programme, and that 90% of eligible adults aged 15 years or older would be successfully screened for HIV, diabetes, and hypertension.To model the potential effect on HIV-related outcomes, we ambitiously assumed that this intervention could successfully initiate and retain 81% of newly diagnosed individuals on ART (ie, assuming a target level of 90% linkage and 90% engagement in HIV care after diagnosis). This corresponds to a 73% reduction in unmet need for ART in people living with HIV in the next decade, modelled as a linear increase in the ART coverage in each subgroup from 2018 to 2028.Using a representative national survey,215 we estimated the proportion of adults with, aware of, and receiving medication for hypertension and diabetes. Based on the number of adults screened and the expected uptake of treatment, we estimated the effect of the integrated intervention on awareness of and treatment for hypertension and diabetes.To assess cost-effectiveness, intervention costs were based on those reported in the SEARCH study,216 and the number of people receiving ART and HIV-related DALYs were obtained from Spectrum. As most treatment costs and DALYs are incurred later in life for NCDs, we report the change in discounted lifetime treatment costs and DALYs with and without intervention. These estimates are based on published treatment cost and DALY estimates,217 and are discounted at 3% per year. More details about the experimental scenarios are provided in the appendix.Sensitivity analyses with less ambitious programme coverage (5% vs 10% of the national population per year), lower antiretroviral therapy uptake, and lower sensitivity and specificity of screening for hypertension and diabetes are also presented in the appendix.NCD=non-communicable disease.

In the absence of additional intervention, the baseline model estimates a 37% increase in the number of women of reproductive age in the next decade (2018\u201328) because of population growth, resulting in a growing need for family planning services in Nigeria. Expansion of contraceptive use to 31% was estimated to result in a 15\u00b75% reduction in the total fertility rate (ie, from 6\u00b75 children per woman at baseline to 5\u00b749 children per woman in 2028; figure 17\n). This reduction in fertility would avert more than 8 million cumulative unintended pregnancies between 2018 and 2028 when compared with a baseline level of contraceptive use of 15%. Increasing PMTCT coverage to 90% of HIV-positive pregnant women in Nigeria by 2023 is estimated to reduce the number of infants acquiring HIV by 56% (figure 17), averting more than 237 500 vertical HIV transmissions cumulatively in the next decade. Expansion of PMTCT services along with family planning resulted in a further estimated 12% reduction in HIV incidence at the national level, which is equivalent to averting more than 295 500 new HIV infections by 2028 (figure 17) and a 3\u00b75% reduction in population-level HIV prevalence.Panel 5Modelling scenario for integration of HIV and reproductive health services in NigeriaSpectrum's demproj, AIM/GOALs, and FamPlan modules were used to create three scenarios describing integration of HIV and reproductive health services in Nigeria.At baseline, the 2016 PMTCT coverage (about 26% of HIV-positive pregnant women) and contraceptive use prevalence (15%) were maintained at fixed levels from 2018 through 2028. We further modelled the transition away from PMTCT Option B (provision of ART during pregnancy and breastfeeding) by year 2020, and replaced that with an equal coverage through Option B+ programmes (providing lifelong ART for all pregnant women living with HIV).For family planning, the prevalence of contraceptive use was scaled up linearly from 15% in 2018, to 31% in 2023 (to meet the unmet need for contraceptives by married Nigerian women),220 and was maintained at that fixed level until 2028.For PMTCT, the proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving ART through Option B+ was scaled up linearly from 16% in 2016, to an ambitious target of 90% coverage in 2023 (in accordance to UNAIDS and PEPFAR targets) for 95% PMTCT coverage221 and was maintained at that target level until 2028.For combined PMTCT and family planning, starting in 2018, both PMTCT coverage and contraceptive use were scaled up linearly as described for each individual scenario above.To assess cost-effectiveness, PMTCT costs were based on PEPFAR estimates.222 HIV-related treatment costs and DALYs were estimated as described for Kenya (panel 4). The effects of increased family planning access were estimated using the ImpactNow model.223 Family planning costs were based on a person-year cost of US$3\u00b748 for a mix of contraceptive methods. Per-user family planning costs ($3\u00b748), maternal and infant health-care costs averted ($3\u00b715), and DALYs averted (0\u00b735) were derived from the ImpactNow model.PMTCT=prevention of mother-to-child-transmission.

            "text": "India is committed to the prevention and control of epidemics of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. The Avahan initiative is estimated to have averted 202 000 HIV infections in 4 years.226 Respondent-driven sampling has been used to engage MSM and people who inject drugs in testing services for sexually transmitted infections and HIV in India.227 In addition to expanding the reach of these screening and prevention programmes, integration of sexually transmitted infections and HIV can also facilitate linkage to, and engagement in, HIV care through a combination of medical, social, and economic interventions targeting key populations. We applied the Spectrum model to estimate the epidemiological and economic effect of such an approach on outcomes related to HIV and sexually transmitted infections in MSM and FSW in India (panel 6\n).Panel 6Modelling scenario for the integration of HIV and sexually transmitted infections in India: MSM and FSWThe Spectrum package was used to model HIV transmission in MSM and FSM in India. An intervention scenario was modelled to represent integration of services for HIV and sexually transmitted infections for these populations.At baseline, ART coverage was maintained at the estimated 2016 level from 2018 to 2028.Using data from the Avahan programme, we modelled a joint community-outreach campaign for HIV and sexually transmitted infection screening in MSM over a 5-year period (2018\u201323). On the basis of reported levels of population coverage from Avahan, we assumed that this programme could reach 60% of MSM and 90% of FSM and will provide an infrastructure for maintaining all improvements in HIV treatment and PrEP coverage over the subsequent 5 years (2024\u201328). To model the potential effect on HIV-related outcomes, we assumed that this integrated intervention can successfully deliver ART to 81% of individuals with diagnosed HIV who are not currently receiving HIV treatment (ie, 90% linkage and 90% engagement). This corresponds to a 54% and 81% reduction in the unmet need for ART in HIV-positive MSM and FSM, respectively. We modelled this effect as a linear increase in the rate of ART coverage from 2018 to 2023. Furthermore, to estimate the potential effect of PrEP, we modelled two additional scenarios for implementation of oral PrEP in these two populations at low (10%) and high (30%) levels of coverage. In these scenarios, PrEP coverage was increased linearly from 2018 to 2023 (continuing at fixed levels through 2028), and PrEP adherence was assumed at 50% for those individuals on PrEP.Because of a lack of representative data on the incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in these two populations, we limited our analysis to study the effect of integrated programmes for screening and treating syphilis infection. Moreover, because of the complexity of modelling the co-epidemics of syphilis and HIV infections in India, we chose a simplified approach for estimating the effect of the intervention on programme participants only and did not estimate the effect on secondary infections averted. Using an array of available estimates from the scientific literature, we estimated the national prevalence of syphilis at 5\u00b78% of FSW and 3\u00b75% of MSM (appendix).Following the methodology proposed by Solomon and colleagues,227 we modelled a scenario for reaching these two populations through respondent-driven sampling, whereby members of these populations are incentivised to visit programme sites and refer others to programme sites, at an estimated cost of US$20\u00b733 per person tested. ART costs were estimated at $126\u00b706 per person-year. PrEP costs of $91 per person-year were based on Stover,228 with updated drug cost estimates for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus lamivudine.229 Syphilis testing and treatment costs for FSW and MSM were estimated at $3\u00b750 and $9\u00b730, respectively.230 DALYs per prevalent syphilis case (0\u00b764) were calculated using the method by Korenromp and colleague,230 using estimates of the global DALYs for syphilis231 and the global prevalence of syphilis.232\nMSM=men who have sex with men.

As suggested by previous studies, PrEP should be tailored to high-risk populations who stand to benefit the most from it. On the other hand, despite assuming a higher level of achievable coverage in FSW (up to 90%), similar programmes resulted in smaller improvements to HIV incidence over time in this population, primarily stemming from the decreasing prevalence of HIV in FSW in India.

A dynamic transmission model of HIV among people who inject drugs (panel 7\n) was developed to assess the effect of scaled-up harm reduction (NSP or non-naltrexone MAT, or both), alone or integrated with scaled-up ART for people who inject drugs. For illustrative purposes, we modelled two different HIV epidemic settings (figure 19\n): (1) Omsk, a major city in the Siberian Federal District with evidence suggestive of a growing epidemic; and (2) Ekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city located in the Ural Federal district with a stable and high-prevalence epidemic in people who inject drugs.Panel 7Modelling methods: integrated harm reduction and ART in RussiaWe used a dynamic epidemic model of HIV in people who inject drugs to assess the potential effect of integrated harm reduction and HIV services for this population in Russia. Full methodological details are in the appendix.A dynamic and deterministic model of HIV transmission in this population was developed, incorporating injecting and sexual transmission in people who inject drugs. People who inject drugs enter due to injecting initiation and exit due to cessation of injecting or death (overdose, HIV-related death, or non-HIV background mortality). The model was stratified by HIV disease stage (uninfected, acute, latent, pre-AIDS, AIDS), ART status, risk (low or high, defined as history of incarceration on the basis of survey data for both settings), sex, and harm reduction access (off or on). We assumed no baseline coverage of any harm reduction and minimal ART coverage (26% of HIV-infected people who inject drugs in 2014). We modelled harm reduction scale-up through exploring different scenarios of harm reduction programme availability: high coverage NSP only, non-naltrexone MAT only, or combined NSP and MAT service, either alone or integrated with expanded ART for people who inject drugs. NSP and non-naltrexone MAT were assumed to reduce injecting-related HIV transmission risk. Non-naltrexone MAT was additionally assumed to increase ART recruitment rates, reduce treatment drop-out, and reduce rates of fatal overdose. However, we also incorporated increased mortality risk within the first 4 weeks of MAT initiation and discontinuation. ART was assumed to reduce HIV-related mortality, as well as sexual and injection-related transmission.The model was calibrated to two cities with differing epidemic profiles in Russia: Omsk (high but expanding HIV epidemic in people who inject drugs) and Ekaterinburg (very high but stable HIV epidemic). For each setting, the model was calibrated to multiple timepoints of HIV prevalence in people who inject drugs, stratified by sex and risk (incarceration history, when available), ART coverage in 2014, proportion high risk (ever incarcerated), and the estimated proportion of transmission related to sexual risk. Because of uncertainty, most parameters were sampled from underlying distributions, generating 100 parameter sets. For each parameter set, the model was calibrated to the data using an optimisation solver and minimising the sum log likelihood. For each of these 100 calibrated parameter sets, model scenarios were run and projections presented as means and 2\u00b75\u201397\u00b75% intervals.We examined the effect of the following intervention scale-up scenarios: (1) no harm reduction base-case; (2) NSP for 50% of people who inject drugs; (3) MAT for 25% of people who inject drugs; (4) MAT for 50% of people who inject drugs; (5) combination NSP\u2013MAT for 50% of people who inject drugs; and (6) combination NSP\u2013MAT for 50% of people who inject drugs integrated with scaled-up ART for HIV-infected people who inject drugs on harm reduction (recruited at three times current rates). We tracked the effect on HIV infections and fatal overdoses in people who inject drugs. The percentage of new HIV infections and fatal overdoses in people who inject drugs averted in the next decade was calculated by comparing the cumulative projected number of events from 2018 to 2028 with intervention scale-up compared with the base-case.ART=antiretroviral therapy. NSP=provision of clean needles and syringes. MAT=medication-assisted therapy. HCV=hepatitis C virus.",

In settings such as Kenya and South Africa, with generalised HIV epidemics and increasing burden of underdiagnosed and undertreated NCDs, integrated community-based screening could yield substantial benefits in identifying and treating hypertension, diabetes, and HIV. The realisation of such benefits, however, will be limited by the capacity of the health-care system to provide appropriate treatment. In settings like Nigeria with low antenatal care coverage and substantial mother to child HIV transmission, integration of PMTCT and family planning services could reduce HIV infections in infants and in the population as a whole as well as prevent unintended pregnancies. Increasing PMTCT coverage will require both access to and uptake of care. The former might require substantial infrastructure and human resources investments, and the latter could benefit from scale-up of peer support or congregation-based interventions.",

Although we have modelled a streamlined approach, a more comprehensive intervention such as Avahan could prove more cost-effective. In some countries, few or no services are available for integration for highly affected populations. For example, in Russia, where there is a high concentration of HIV in people who inject drugs, the harm reduction, drug treatment, and HIV services for this population are either illegal or reach few in need. As such, there is an urgent need in Russia first for legal changes and capacity building to provide basic health services for people who inject drugs, ideally in an integrated programme that could reduce HIV, HCV, fatal overdose, and mass incarceration. Future work should consider the optimal integration strategy in each country based on HIV epidemiology and the health-care system, and models of integration will be improved through increased understanding of barriers and facilitators of integration and will depend on how well different integration scenarios can achieve economies of scope and scale.

Economic growth offers an opportunity for many LMICs to increase investments in health,4 but national leaders must demonstrate sufficient political will to allocate these dividends to health services. A recent analysis by the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network4 found per-capita health spending in Bangladesh and Pakistan would roughly triple and double, respectively, were these countries to allocate towards health the share of national budget spent by similarly situated countries that place greater priority on health. Realisation of the vision of sustainable health for all will require LMICs to dig much deeper into their own pockets, and the World Bank and regional development banks must aid by expanding incentives to invest in health.

The HIV response must take bolder action to remove social and structural barriers to good health; this includes dismantling the global war on drugs, repealing laws that criminalise same-sex relations, and eliminating laws that criminalise HIV exposure, non-disclosure, or transmission.",
