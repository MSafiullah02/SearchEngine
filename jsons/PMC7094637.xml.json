It has been used as a medicinal plant for more than 2000 years from ShenNongBenCaoJing, a famous ancient Chinese medicinal literary and is similar to Folium Isatidis, but lesser bitter in flavor and cold in nature, usually used for seasonal febrile diseases, pestilence, mumps, eruptive diseases, inflammatory diseases with redness of skin and sorethroat [1]. Now pharmacological research indicated that Banlangen has a widely useful activities including anti-virus, anti-bacterial, anti-endotoxic, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, immune regulatory effect [2], [3], [4]. Recently, Banlangen has been found to be highly active inhibition replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus [5].",

Clemastanin B and indigoticoside A (structures shown in Fig. 1\n), two major lignans in Banlangen, have been isolated by some conventional methods including silica gel, sephadex and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, which are tedious, time consuming and needing multiple steps. So, an effective separation and isolation technique was required. High-speed counter-current chromatography, a support free liquid\u2013liquid partition chromatographic technique, eliminates irreversible adsorption of the sample onto solid support [14], has an excellent sample recovery. The method permits directly introduction of crude samples into the column without more preparation, so it has been successfully applied to isolate and purify a number of natural products [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. But, there have no scientific literature reports of using HSCCC to isolate and purify clemastanin B and indigoticoside A from the plant of Banlangen.",

The obtained fractions produced 59.2 mg clemastanin B and 66.1 mg indigoticoside A with purities of 94.6% and 99.0% determined by HPLC (shown in Fig. 2B and C). As expected, the HPLC analysis of each fraction revealed that the components eluted in the order of peaks 1 (clemastanin B) and 2 (indigoticoside A). The recoveries of clemastanin B and indigoticoside A were 90.3% and 92.2%, respectively (Fig. 3\n).",
