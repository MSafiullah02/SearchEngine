Coronaviruses are divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Infection of neonatal pigs with the alphacoronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), results in mal-absorptive diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and death (Madson et al., 2016; Saif et al., 2012). The first outbreak of PEDV on U.S. farms in 2013 resulted in the death of nearly 7 million pigs or about 10% of U.S. pig production for that year (Stevenson et al., 2013). In 2014, a diarrhea-causing porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was isolated from five pig farms in Ohio (Wang et al., 2014). The M and N gene sequences were 99% identical to another PDCoV, HKU15, from China. Since 2014, PDCoV has rapidly spread throughout pig-producing regions in the U.S.",

            "text": "Recent studies have focused on the potential role of APN as a receptor for PDCoV. The data have yielded three different observations and conclusions. In 2018, Wang et al. showed that cell lines, such as Vero and BHK-21, were resistant to infection with PDCoV and TGEV. Permissiveness was acquired after transfection of both cell lines with a plasmid expressing a pAPN cDNA. PDCoV and TGEV growth curves on the transfected cells showed a yield greater than 5 log10 TCID50/ml. The authors concluded that pAPN is a functional receptor for PDCoV. Also, in 2018, Zhu et al., reported similar results. However, HeLa cells, which were pAPN-negative, and resistant to TGEV, supported PDCoV infection. Furthermore, a knockout of pAPN expression in the porcine IPI-21 cell line was prepared by using CRISPR to inactivate ANPEP, the gene which codes for APN. The ANPEP KO IPI-21 cells were completely resistant to TGEV, but retained permissiveness for PDCoV. The authors concluded that \u201cpAPN is likely not a critical functional receptor for PDCoV, although it is involved in PDCoV infection\u201d. The third outcome related to pAPN and PDCoV is found in Li et al. (2018), who evaluated the permissiveness of ANPEP knockout (KO) ST cells to infection with TGEV and PDCoV. ST cells lacking pAPN were completely resistant to TGEV but retained a small capacity to support PDCoV infection. The authors concluded that PDCoV utilizes pAPN as a primary receptor for virus attachment, but the presence of a second co-receptor contributes to the permissiveness of cells for infection. Furthermore, the PDCoV co-receptor can retain function independent of pAPN.",

However, lung fibroblast-like cells, which appeared following the outgrowth of ANPEP KO PAM cultures, were susceptible to PDCoV but remained resistance to TGEV.

At four days after infection, one WT and one KO pigs were removed from the study and necropsied. RT-PCR amplification of PDCoV nucleic acid in intestines and mesenteric lymph nodes showed that both pigs were negative for PDCoV. The presence of PDCoV infection was also assessed by virus-specific neutralizing activity measured in serum at the termination of the study, 14 days after infection. The results, summarized in Table 1, showed that two of the remaining six pigs seroconverted; one WT and one KO pig. Clinical signs, such as diarrhea and fever, were not detected in any of the infected WT or KO pigs. The absence of clinical signs is likely a result of the older-age pigs used in the infection study.

(2018), who concluded that APN is a receptor for PDCoV. In contrast, the PDCoV-positive infection results for fibroblast-like cells derived from the ANPEP KO cultures support the observations of Zhu et al. (2018), who concluded that APN is not a functional receptor for PDCoV (see Fig. 1C). When taken together, our data support the observations of Li et al. (2018) who concluded that there are APN-dependent and APN-independent receptors for PDCoV. We hypothesize that PAMs possess only the APN receptor, while the lung-derived fibroblast-like cells possess both receptors. However, since the APN-independent receptors for PDCoV have not been identified, we currently cannot easily prove this hypothesis and it remains to be elucidated in future studies.",

            "text": "Ultimately, the importance of pAPN as a receptor for PDCoV is determined by the permissiveness of ANPEP KO pigs for infection. The results in Table 1, showing positive results for the presence of PDCoV nucleic acid in the feces of infected ANPEP KO pigs confirms the results obtained following the infection of KO fibroblast-like cells. These data support the notion that APN is not required for PDCoV infection of pigs. However, the conclusion that ANPEP KO pigs retain permissiveness for infection with PDCoV comes with a few caveats. For example, all fecal samples on day 1 after infection were positive for PDCoV nucleic acid and by 3 days, the virus was only detected in one KO pig. Intestinal tissues from the two pigs tested, one WT and one KO, were negative for PDCoV. The positive results obtained for feces can be explained by the presence of environmental contamination caused by the residual inoculum used for infection. However, support for a productive infection of the KO pigs comes from the seroconversion of one KO pig at 14 days after infection (see Table 1). A second caveat comes from the transient nature of PDCoV infection in the WT and KO pigs used in this study, which made it difficult to determine if APN plays a role in the disease process. Previous studies show that neonatal piglets are more susceptible than weaned pigs to enteric virus infection (Thomas et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015). The relationship of pig age and PDCoV infection outcome has not been studied in detail; however, it is speculated that PDCoV infection may be age-dependent, similar to PEDV, with more severe outcomes in younger piglets. In this study, 28-33 day-old ANPEP KO and WT pigs were used for PDCoV inoculation. In future studies, a more sensitive neonatal pig infection model can be used which may yield a more accurate determination regarding the role of APN in PDCoV infection of its natural host.",

After 24 h from infection, the cells were stained and fixed with AlexaFluor488-labeled anti-TGEV or anti-PDCoV antibodies and the percent antigen-positive cells recorded. (B) ANPEP WT and KO lung-derived fibroblast-like cells were infected with TGEV or PDCoV at an MOI of 0.0001\u201310. After 24 h from infection, the cells were stained and fixed with AlexaFluor488-labeled anti-TGEV or anti-PDCoV antibodies and the percent antigen-positive cells determined.
