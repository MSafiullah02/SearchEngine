These special wastes originate in households and pose problems in their safe handling. They pose human health and environmental hazards. Examples of HBW include expired drugs, bandages, syringes, sanitary napkins, disposable diapers, expired cosmetics, blood stained cloths, used bottles of syrups/tablets/ear-drops/eye-drops, used ointment tubes, empty pain killer spray cans, contaminated meat, ear buds, dead animals, etc.",

Irrespective of whether a country is under developed or developed, the rural areas in the country do contribute to the biomedical waste in substantial quantities. Even though the impact may not be visible immediately, it would harm the health and environment over a period of time. The common biomedical waste in rural area includes placenta during animal birth, carcase of dead sick animals, intentionally killed rodents, expired drugs, waste generated in veterinary hospitals and incemation centres. Further the waste from aopsials in rural area and household biomedical waste discussed earlier can not be over ruled which include diapers, sanitary napkins, condoms, bandages. The impact of such practice will occur over period of time. But ignorance among the rural people often leads to improper disposal contaminating food items produced. Quantities are often not estimated and reported. The fly-tipping of biomedical waste from urban area and illegal burying would also cause for an accumulating of biomedical waste in the rural area.",

While it is recommended to use disinfectant a point of generation with respect to sharps, other wastes can be disinfected as shown in Fig. 6.16. Chemical treatment is the choice where power is not available to operate autoclave or any other equipment which demands power. Chemicals are added to the waste to kill or inactivate the pathogens in biomedical waste. The choice of chemical depends on the availability of chemical and safety of the operator. It is essential that large biomedical waste and waste with cavity be shredded for better efficiency. Table 6.6 shows commonly used chemical disinfectants in which can be used for disinfection of biomedical waste. 1 % (of active chlorine) sodium hypochlorite is most commonly used disinfectant due to safety reason but care should be taken to treat the waste while active chlorine is still present as chemical is not stable.\n\n",
