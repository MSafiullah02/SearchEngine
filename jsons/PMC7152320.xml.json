            "text": "The dengue virus complex consists of four antigenically related but distinct flaviviruses termed dengue virus serotypes 1 through 4 (DEN1 to DEN4).4 Dengue viruses are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitos in epidemic and endemic outbreaks and cause acute infections. Three to 6 days after a mosquito bite the virus spreads via the bloodstream, and among the various organs it can be isolated frequently from liver samples,5 where dengue viral antigens have been detected in Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatocytes.6, 7 Dengue virus infection usually causes a flulike illness with a rash\u2014dengue fever. Hepatomegaly and elevated serum aminotransferases, which are usually mild, are common in dengue virus infections.8, 9 Clinically more severe diseases, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), can follow secondary infection with dengue virus of a different serotype, thus suggesting that immune responses generated during previous exposure to dengue viruses may enhance the damage triggered by secondary dengue infection. In DHF there are widespread petechial hemorrhages together with multiple organ damage; in DSS, which mostly affects children younger than 15 years, there is extensive capillary leakage and severe fluid depletion leading to hypovolemic shock. If untreated, mortality approaches 50%. In fatal cases of DHF the liver is enlarged, is pale as a result of steatosis, and shows multifocal hemorrhages. Microscopically, focal hepatocellular necrotic areas are seen, as well as coalescent perivenular and midzonal necrosis with Councilman bodies, but relatively little inflammatory cell infiltration.10, 11 It is supposed that liver injury is mediated by dengue virus infection of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, as in vitro infection of a human hepatoma cell line with dengue virus has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death.12\n",

            "text": "The spectrum of infection with yellow fever virus ranges from subclinical infection to a life-threatening disease with fever, jaundice, renal failure, and hemorrhage. Usually, yellow fever initially appears as an acute, flulike illness of sudden onset with fever, myalgia, and headache that cannot easily be distinguished from other acute infections.15 Between 48 and 72 hours after onset, serum aminotransferases start to rise, thus heralding the development of jaundice. The degree of liver abnormalities at this stage predicts the severity of liver disease later during the course of the illness.16 Next, a period of remission lasting up to 48 hours may follow the initial infection. Patients with abortive infection recover at this stage, but approximately 15% of patients will enter the third stage of intoxication, which is characterized by the return of fever, prostration, and organ dysfunction leading to nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, oliguria, and a hemorrhagic diathesis. Yellow fever differs from all other viral causes of hepatitis by the fact that serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels exceed those of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Aminotransferase levels are proportional to the severity of disease.16 Direct bilirubin levels range between 5 and 10 mg/dl, with levels being higher in those with fatal infection than in recovering patients. The diagnosis of yellow fever is confirmed by the serologic demonstration of specific IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or by isolation of the virus from blood. Liver biopsy is not recommended because of a high risk for hemorrhage.",

Rarely, intranuclear inclusion bodies (Torres bodies) are present. Fatty changes may be prominent. In specimens from surviving patients, the liver shows ballooned hepatocytes and regenerative hyperplasia with multiple multinucleated hepatocytes and some portal inflammation consisting mainly of CD4+ T cells and smaller numbers of natural killer and CD8+ T cells.19, 20 Biopsy specimens from survivors during the recovery phase may show a nonspecific acinar hepatitis.21 However, the hepatic reticular architecture is not disrupted, and in nonfatal cases healing is complete without any residual postnecrotic fibrosis.",

Other features include weakness, severe headache, pain in the muscles of the trunk and lower part of the back, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.37, 45, 46 A nonproductive cough, pharyngitis, and a maculopapular rash on the upper half of the body are also frequent findings. Symptoms persist with worsening of prostration, stupor, and hypotension; disseminated intravascular coagulation eventually leads to conjunctival hemorrhages, easy bruising, and bleeding from venipuncture sites. Marked laboratory abnormalities include a striking leukopenia with immature granulocytes and abnormal lymphocytes, as well as thrombocytopenia. Filoviruses cause multifocal hepatic necrosis. Thus AST and ALT levels rise rapidly in the first days. Hypoproteinemia and proteinuria may also be present. The hepatic pathology is similar to that seen with Lassa virus infection: spotty to widespread necrosis of hepatocytes and minimal hepatic inflammation, but no cholestasis.47, 48, 49 Abundant filovirus particles are found in blood, phagocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes.

Isolates from different regions show considerable genetic diversity. Farmers and healthcare workers are particular at risk for this infection, but fortunately, CCHF develops in only one of five people infected. The disease has four stages: incubation, prehemorrhagic, hemorrhagic, and convalescence. Incubation takes 3 to 7 days, and then fever, headache, myalgia, and dizziness develop suddenly. Facial hyperemia, conjunctivitis, and occasionally diarrhea are also noted. This stage lasts 4 to 5 days. The hemorrhagic period is short (2 to 3 days). The most common bleeding sites are in the nose, the gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract, and the respiratory tract. In survivors, the convalescence phase begins about 10 to 20 days after the onset of disease. RT-PCR is the method of choice for rapid laboratory confirmation of CCHF viral infection.54 Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are consistent laboratory features, and raised levels of AST, ALT, and lactate dehydrogenase and prolonged coagulation tests are other common findings. Aminotransferase levels seem to correlate with the severity of disease.55, 56 Microscopic examination of liver tissue reveals variable degrees of hepatocellular necrosis with hemorrhage and Councilman bodies, fatty changes, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, and mild mononuclear portal inflammatory infiltrates.57\n",

They are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that are carried primarily in rodents, which shed the virus in their urine, saliva, and feces. The virus is inhaled by humans as aerosols from dried rodent excreta or, in unusual circumstances, is transmitted via rodent bites.63 Hantaviruses exist in multiple serotypes worldwide, which differ in their virulence. Some are considered nonpathogenic, whereas certain isolates can produce two distinct severe syndromes in humans: Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, mostly caused by isolates in the Americas, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, caused by isolates (Seoul virus, Dobrava virus, Puumala virus, Hantaan virus) in Europe and Asia.64 In some instances, patients with Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever have suffered from severe acute hepatitis, whereas renal damage was rather mild.65, 66 Furthermore, a significantly increased prevalence of Hantavirus antibodies has been reported in patients with acute hepatitis of unknown cause from southwestern China67 and in patients with chronic hepatitis from Japan.68 However, the latter study failed to detect any Hantavirus antibodies in patients with acute hepatitis, thus implying a rather indirect pathogenetic role of Hantaviruses. Of note, Hantavirus infection has been observed to trigger acute exacerbations of autoimmune liver disease, and this mechanism has been proposed to contribute to community-acquired hepatitis.69 Nevertheless, the precise role of Hantavirus infections in human liver disease still awaits clarification. Analogous to other bunyaviruses, Hantavirus is sensitive to ribavirin, which, although not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, can be used as emergency treatment.70\n",

The infection begins abruptly with high fever, symmetric polyarthralgia, and macular or maculopapular rash.73 Pruritus and bullous skin lesions have also been described. Previously, chikungunya fever has been considered a self-limited disease. However, severe complications, including acute viral hepatitis and death, have been reported in recent outbreaks, particularly in elderly patients (>65 years) and people with chronic medical problems. Clinically, chikungunya fever must be differentiated from dengue fever, which shares many symptoms and features. Serology is the primary diagnostic tool in clinical practice, and chikungunya IgM antibodies become detectable by ELISA 5 days after the onset of symptoms. Viral culture and molecular techniques are valuable tools in a research setting. Although interferon alfa and ribavirin exhibit in vitro activity against chikungunya virus,74 an effective specific antiviral therapy does not exist. Thus treatment is primarily supportive. Chikungunya infection cannot currently be prevented by vaccination.",

This concept is also supported by the observation that regression of Kaposi sarcoma is achieved when immunosuppression is reduced in patients with a transplant172, 173 and when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved immune function in subjects with AIDS.174 Other risk factors for Kaposi sarcoma, the predominant manifestation of HHV8-associated disease, are multiple homosexual contacts in HIV-infected men175 and, in the transplant setting, male sex, old age, and lung transplantation.176\n",

Adenoviruses can persist in human tissue over prolonged periods190, 191 and can cause a variety of clinical syndromes in immunocompromised individuals, including serious hepatitis.192 Adenoviral hepatitis occurs in congenital and acquired immunodeficiency syndromes and may be fatal in these individuals.193, 194, 195, 196 Adenoviral hepatitis is a particular problem in pediatric liver transplantation and was identified in 14 (3%) of 484 pediatric liver transplant recipients197; 6 of the 14 patients died, 4 required retransplantation, and only 4 patients recovered with a decrease in immunosuppressive therapy. Transmission of latent adenovirus with the donated organ seems to be a potential risk factor for this complication.198 The signs and symptoms of adenoviral hepatitis resemble those of HSV infection and consist of massively elevated aminotransferase levels and severe coagulopathy. There are extensive areas of liver cell necrosis with little inflammation and intranuclear inclusion bodies (Fig. 34-5, A to D\n).

            "text": "Influenza viruses represent three genera in the Orthomyxoviridae family. Generally, influenza A viruses are associated with more severe disease in humans than are influenza B and C viruses. Influenza A is further subdivided with respect to genetic variation in its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes. Influenza viruses commonly cause a self-limited acute respiratory infection manifested as fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and occasionally, gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore aminotransferase levels are not monitored routinely. In the 2004 H1N5 influenza outbreak, however, about 60% of patients with pneumonia had deranged liver function test values and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea on initial evaluation.203 Of note, among other extrahepatic abnormalities, autopsy revealed hepatic centrolobular necrosis, although neither viral antigen detection nor RT-PCR could provide evidence of viral liver disease.204 Thus liver damage in patients dying of influenza has been considered immune mediated, in particular because high cytokine levels were detected.205 Of note, in 4 of 15 volunteers infected intranasally with influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1), markedly elevated aminotransferase levels also transiently developed.200 This experimental observation is remarkable because the rise in liver enzymes occurred after pyrexia had settled, thus suggesting that the liver damage was mediated by the host's immune response rather than viral infection of the liver. It has been proposed that immune-mediated liver damage may also be the cause of elevated aminotransferases in other viral respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus,206 although cardiovascular effects and hepatic ischemia must be considered in these severely ill patients as well.207\n",

In most patients, aminotransferase levels started to rise toward the end of the first week and peaked at the end of the second week. With resolution of SARS, aminotransferases normalized spontaneously in the majority of patients. Severe liver damage (ALT more than five times the upper limit of normal) was observed more frequently in male patients and those with significant other co-morbid conditions or elevated serum creatinine levels.215 The role of concomitant hepatitis B in disease severity is controversial.214, 215 However, there was a close relationship between the severity of hepatic dysfunction and degree of pulmonary damage and the outcome of SARS.214 Thus high ALT levels appeared to be an independent predictor of more severe disease and a worse outcome.",

Arthropathy and aplastic anemia are further complications in adults. Fetal infection during gestation is a cause of hydrops fetalis, which is associated with marked damage to the liver241; hepatocytes have ballooned, swollen nuclei that harbor eosinophilic nuclear inclusion bodies. In addition, erythroid-myeloid precursors are greatly expanded in the sinusoids. Parvovirus B19 has also been identified as a cause of acute hepatitis242 and has been incriminated as the underlying cause in acute liver failure with anemia.243 However, a subsequent study could not confirm parvovirus B19 as a cause of fulminant hepatic failure.244\n",
