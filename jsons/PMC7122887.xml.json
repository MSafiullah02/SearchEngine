Approximately, a twofold increase in prevalence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms after long-distance run is observed, as compared with non-runner counterparts from control groups [3, 5]. On the other hand, regular moderate physical activity is believed to contribute to greater resistance to respiratory infections. Regular exercise at moderate level is associated with reduced incidence of URTI episodes and lower intensity of infectious symptoms [6, 7]. This phenomenon has been graphically depicted as the so-called J-shaped curve which clearly shows that both sedentary lifestyle and excessive strenuous exercise constitute risk factors for increased susceptibility to respiratory infections [1] (Fig. 9.1).",

This modified model has been nicknamed \u201cS-curve\u201d [9]. One possible explanation for lower infection rate in top-level exercisers is the fact that subjects engaging in regular exercise of high intensity are predominantly those with perfect physical stamina and perfect immune health status that enable them to resist infections and carry on with training, thus permitting their inclusion to \u201celite\u201d group on the basis of their achievements.",

Both viruses (rhinovirus, particularly in spring, influenza and parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and coronavirus) and bacteria (streptococci, staphylococci) are claimed to be involved in causing URTI in athletes, although data from large systematic studies including the isolation and identification of the responsible agents are still very limited (Table 9.1). Spence and colleagues have analyzed 37 infectious episodes in 28 competitive and noncompetitive athletes [11]. In that group, infectious etiology could be established only with regard to 11 episodes. Identified viral pathogens included rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, whereas M. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae were confirmed as bacteria causing URTI symptoms. A study by Cox et al. [12] identified viral or bacterial pathogen in 30% of athletes with upper respiratory symptoms, while 57% of all cases were accompanied either by presence of a detectable pathogen or by other laboratory pathological features of infection. Bacterial cause was found in 3% of cases only, while most frequently detected viral pathogens included rhinovirus (10%); influenza virus (10%); parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (6%); and coronaviruses (3%). Hitherto published data indicate that pathogen identification is possible in approx. 45% of URTI symptoms in athletes [13]. A similar proportion has been also described regarding URTI symptoms in the general population [14].",

            "text": "Decreased effectiveness of local humoral immune response at the level of the respiratory mucosae is one of the characteristic features associated with intense physical exercise. This is predominantly reflected in decreased salivary IgA (sIgA) concentrations, but the importance of other proteins contained in saliva has been recently pointed at in the context of susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections [15]. Increased URTI susceptibility following participation in long-distance runs was observed in multiple studies [1\u20135]. Already in 1983 Peters and Bateman [3] ascertained the presence of URTI symptoms in one-third of ultramarathon participants as compared with 15% of non-running controls. Moreover, the prevalence of URTI symptoms was more prevalent in those who performed better in terms of time required to complete the run. Another study performed in runners showed, however, that those who were more committed to intensive training during preparations to long-distance run were less likely to develop infection symptoms [4]. Robson-Ansley and colleagues [5] reported a 47% prevalence of URTI symptoms over the 2-week period following participation to the London Marathon. In their study, however, a significant correlation of URTI symptoms occurred with positive IgE-mediated allergen sensitizations and atopic status, as assessed by the AQUA questionnaire designed for allergy screening in athletes [16]. The question related to the proportion of upper respiratory infection-like symptoms due to exposure to inhalant allergens and not to infection per se therefore arises. Several studies were performed in nonprofessional exercisers or sedentary subjects [6, 7] revealing that decrease in susceptibility to URTI is predominantly visible in regular exercisers who do not advance into professional, high-endurance type of training.",

Decreased salivary IgA is usually correlated with increased URTI susceptibility, although this mutual association is not always evident [15]. A pioneer study by Tomasi et al. [18] comparing salivary IgA levels in cross-country skiers versus age-matched controls showed significant decreases both at baseline and after participation in a competitive run. Studies in swimmers [19, 20] also showed decreased IgA levels in saliva after training. Additionally, salivary IgA levels were inversely correlated with duration and intensity of training, as well as with number of reported infections [19]. Similarly, decreased salivary IgA was described as a risk factor for developing upper respiratory symptoms in male yacht race participants [21].",

Moreover, some studies do not confirm direct association between decreased salivary IgA and frequency or severity of respiratory infections [28\u201330].This leads to assumption that influence of factors other than excessive exercise load should be taken into consideration while interpreting the data regarding salivary IgA levels. These factors include, among others, pattern of exercise, its intensity and duration, as well as the general stamina of each individual. In the case of extremely intensive training programs, provisions should be made for additional factors modifying immune response, such as increased energy consumption, sleep deprivation, altitude above sea level, and stress-associated psychological factors [15, 31\u201333].",

Secondary to this, increased serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines have been observed (e.g., IL-10, IL-1ra) [15, 46\u201351]. Serum levels of anti-inflammatory IL-1ra protein observed in young speed skaters were negatively correlated with ambient air temperature during winter season in the outdoor training area, suggesting that serum IL-1ra is partly reflecting cold air exposure in winter athletes. In addition, serum IL-1ra was significantly elevated in winter season only in athletes not reporting frequent respiratory tract infections [52] which adds further insight into the significance of anti-inflammatory cytokine properties in conditioning susceptibility to respiratory infections.",

The appearance of infection-like episodes without evidence for the role of infectious pathogens may result from a transient loss of control of such local inflammation due to external physicochemical factors present in the environment where exercise is performed (e.g., swimming pool disinfectants, cold and dry air hyperpnea) [13].",
