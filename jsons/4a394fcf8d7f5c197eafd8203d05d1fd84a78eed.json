However, the evidence to show the direct involvement of ABCB1 in the longevity is poor. The conclusion that the expression of ABCB1 is higher than other animals is not supported by the results, either. The main result is just the comparison between cell lines. They also compared ABCB1 protein in various tissues from bat with that in human tissues (commercially available). Because ABCB1 is not expressed uniformly in human tissues, the comparison shown in Fig  7C is not convincing. The corresponding part of mouse and bat tissues should be used for the comparison. Because mouse tissues express two types of abcb1, the antibody (possibly C219) that recognizes both types should be used. The reasonable explanation why the high expression of ABCB1 supports the longevity of bats is also required.",

            "text": "This article argues that high ABCB1 expression in bats protects them from chemical DNA damaging agents and may explain their relatively long lifespan. Using cell lines, the authors demonstrate that bat cells express higher levels of ABCB1 than cells from mice and humans, and accumulate higher levels of drugs that are known ABCB1 substrates, such as doxorubicin. Knockdown and chemical inhibition of the ABCB1 transporter sensitizes bat cells to killing with doxorubicin, and leads to an increase in DNA double strand breaks assessed directly by comet assays, and indirectly by gamma H2AX. This work represents a mechanism of resistance to DNA damage that is well known for cancer cells, but has not previously been described at the whole-organism level. Given the implications for longevity and cancer resistance, the paper will likely be of interest across several disciplines. This study presents an exciting set of data that suggest the long lifespan and low cancer rates observed in bats may be explained by small molecule efflux, and not due to an increased DNA damage response. However the data do not support the strong statement in the discussion that \"Our data refute alterations to the DDR pathway as a plausible mechanism for increased DNA damage resistance\". In order to justify this central claim, a number of additional experiments and controls should be carried out. Even if the claim is softened, these experiments are needed to provide clarify the relative importance of DNA repair capacity and efflux as resistance mechanisms for bats exposed to DNA damaging agents.",

            "text": "1. This manuscript could be greatly strengthened by inclusion of additional methods for assessing DNA repair capacity. The authors rely heavily on gamma H2AX expression levels, which are an indirect measure of DNA double strand breaks. However the western blotting approach used here cannot distinguish gamma H2AX foci that are associated with double strand breaks from pan-nuclear gamma H2AX that can represent a preapoptotic signal (see for example Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 13;107(15):6870-5) ). Gamma H2AX also only reports on double strand breaks, but not other types of DNA damage. Importantly, doxorubicin may kill cells by inducing oxidative DNA damage, which may not be detected by the methods used in this manuscript. 2. The neutral comet assays employed in Fig. 6 also only report on double strand breaks, and were not used to confirm that rates of repair are similar between cells from bats versus cells from other mammalian organisms when the DNA damaging agent is not an ABCB1 substrate. For example, the relative rates of repair for DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation could be measured in human cells and bat cells. Comet assays should be performed at multiple time points to draw conclusions about DNA repair kinetics. An alkaline comet assay should be performed to measure repair of abasic sites and single strand breaks induced following exposure to reactive oxygen species. Inclusion of other types of DNA damaging agents, such as radiation and hydrogen peroxide, which induce oxidative damage independent of ABCB1 status would greatly strengthen the argument that bat cells do not depend on increased DNA repair capacity to achieve relative resistance to DNA damaging agents.",

Data for at least one additional human cell line (ideally primary human cells from a different tissue) should be added to these experiments. Fig. 3D should be made available in a format analogous to that in Fig. 2A so the reader can assess the differences among bat, mouse and human cell lines in the absence of the verapamil. 8. A positive control for detection of human ABCB1 with the antibody used in the immunoblot presented in Fig. 7 is needed to confirm the absence (or low levels) of the protein in human tissues. 9. The manuscript could be greatly strengthened by an in vivo confirmation of the findings. Although the authors argue persuasively that longevity studies are not feasible with bats, an important test of the role of the ABCB1 transporter in tumorigenesis and tolerance of lethal viruses (Fig. 8 ) seems feasible by combining ABCB1 inhibition with the relevant exposures. An alternate, simpler in vivo test of the conclusion that bats uniquely resist DNA damaging agents by efflux mechanisms would be to measure LC50 values in bats and mice for a small molecule DNA damaging agent that is an ABCB1 substrate (e.g. doxorubicin) versus an efflux-independent agent (e.g. ionizing radiation).",

This has lead to a lot of speculation and attempts to tie in bat immunity and potential adaptation to flight (particularly in the discussion), which perhaps is warranted but the data presented here do not show or support these speculations. I recommend that this paper be resubmitted for another review, once rewritten with a different and more appropriate focus. While the mechanistic studies are exquisite and an example of what is required to establish novel model study species, the ecological and evolutionary aspects of bats presented in this paper are based on old literature that needs updating, sometimes is incorrect, misleading and needs a major rewrite. The results reported are important findings but they need to be correctly repackaged to reach their full impact and not mislead readers.

Myotis brandtii, with the oldest longevity record was at least 41 when re-caught, first captured as an adult of unknown age, considered at least >1 years of age given the fused finger bones, and re-caught 40 years later. They should use more up to date aging data for bat longevities, which would be AnAge < http://genomics.senescence.info/species/>. According to this website which reflects some of the most up to date literature, bats can live approx. 6-41 years, this reflect the range of longevities in bats Molossus molossus (>5.6 years)-Myotis brantii (>41 years). What they have not done is correct for body size, such as carried out in Austad 2010 J. Comp. Path V142, S10-S21 Fig 2. This is what sets bats apart from other species given their body size, not their actual chronological age, showing that Brandts bats can live up to 10 times longer than would be expected given their body size. This is what makes bats an interesting species to explore exceptional longevity and therefore has driven this study. Although they refer to Max Rubner's rate of living theory they really don't explore what this means in terms of making bats outliers. They need to highlight why bats are so unique given their longevity. This is not clear throughout.",

Assuming, given the claims the authors make, that this adaptation of removing genotoxic substances is ancestral, the bat ancestor would not have been faced with such a large range of different environments. Bats diverged into their different biological niches over millions of years (Teeling et al, Science 307 (5709), 580-584). This rationale either needs to be removed or better qualified. >Discussion. Bats don't experience the majority of these toxic substances in the wild. The authors refer to cadmium as a naturally occurring substance. How often to bats experience this toxin? Again I'm not sure what selective pressure would have driven this adaptation in the bat ancestor? The evolution of the ABCB1 expression should predate the massive expansion into all these niches, a preadaptation which has allowed bats to expand? But then why did it evolve in the first place? Again the authors must reconsider and further explore this rationale. > Discussion. The authors need to update their references and value pertaining to the metabolic consequences of flight in bats. There have been many more recent studies on this area. > Discussion: The authors cannot state that they have shown in their genome paper (40) that bats have adaptively lost PYHINS to reduce inflammation as an adaptation to flight. This is a gross over statement of what their paper showed, which was simply a lack of PYHINS in bat s compared with other mammals which they correlated with flight acquisition. This really is misleading. Also the tenuous link between ABCB1 and anti-inflammation/immunity mechanisms needs to be clarified. It might be correct but there are no data to show this here. I think reporting their new findings in light of these other speculated adaptations is a little contrived. I'm not sure that this brings anything more to this paper and may even dilute the results.",

Therefore, given the overall comments of the reviewer and as suggested by Reviewer #3, we decided to rewrite the manuscript to change the focus to DNA damage resistance via efflux of genotoxic substances as a potentially novel tumour suppressive mechanism in bats. DNA damage is well-established as the major cause of tumours (Polo, S. E. and Jackson, S. P. 2011; Tubbs, A. and Nussenzweig, A. 2017). Reviewers #2 and #3 both mentioned that the strength and novelty of our manuscript is the finding that efficient efflux mediated by ABCB1 reduces DNA damage in bat cells.

Since the epitope sequence detected by the H241 antibody is not 100% conserved between human and bat (92% similarity between human and bat), this antibody might have a lower affinity to bat ABCB1 than to human ABCB1. Thus, the H241 antibody might underestimate the levels of ABCB1 in bat, compared to human ABCB1. Nevertheless, we confirmed the specificity of the H241 antibody for bat ABCB1, as ABCB1 knockdown efficiently depleted the protein (Fig.  6A ). We also included new RT-qPCR data that compare ABCB1 mRNA levels in different tissues from bat and human to support the results of our Western blotting analysis (Fig. 7C ). We would like to emphasize that we did compare the expression of ABCB1 using the same origin of tissues between human and bat since ABCB1 is not expressed uniformly in human tissues. We examined the tissues that are known to highly express ABCB1 in human such as kidney, small intestine, large intestine, and adrenal gland, as well as the tissues which are known to express very low or no ABCB1 in human such as lung and spleen (Fig. 7D ).

Knockdown and chemical inhibition of the ABCB1 transporter sensitizes bat cells to killing with doxorubicin, and leads to an increase in DNA double strand breaks assessed directly by comet assays, and indirectly by gamma H2AX.

The authors rely heavily on gamma H2AX expression levels, which are an indirect measure of DNA double strand breaks. However the western blotting approach used here cannot distinguish gamma H2AX foci that are associated with double strand breaks from pan-nuclear gamma H2AX that can represent a preapoptotic signal (see for example Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 13;107(15):6870-5) ). Gamma H2AX also only reports on double strand breaks, but not other types of DNA damage. Importantly, doxorubicin may kill cells by inducing oxidative DNA damage, which may not be detected by the methods used in this manuscript.",

Given the complex effects of doxorubicin, we rewrote the manuscript and simplified our point by focusing on the ability of ABCB1 to suppress the accumulation of intracellular doxorubicin, and thus prevent DNA damage and cell death. 2. The neutral comet assays employed in Fig. 6 also only report on double strand breaks, and were not used to confirm that rates of repair are similar between cells from bats versus cells from other mammalian organisms when the DNA damaging agent is not an ABCB1 substrate. For example, the relative rates of repair for DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation could be measured in human cells and bat cells. Comet assays should be performed at multiple time points to draw conclusions about DNA repair kinetics. An alkaline comet assay should be performed to measure repair of abasic sites and single strand breaks induced following exposure to reactive oxygen species. Inclusion of other types of DNA damaging agents, such as radiation and hydrogen peroxide, which induce oxidative damage independent of ABCB1 status would greatly strengthen the argument that bat cells do not depend on increased DNA repair capacity to achieve relative resistance to DNA damaging agents.",

On the other hand, and consistent with a previous report of DNA repair (Cortopassi, G.

We agree that based on the results from the previous Fig. 2 , the amount of doxorubicin accumulated in human WI-38 cells was only about 2 times higher than in bat PaLung cells, which does not fully explain the difference in dose-dependence of \u03b3H2AX between bat and human cells (new Fig. 2A and 2E ). One possible explanation is the efficiency of histone eviction. The threshold of doxorubicin required to trigger histone eviction might be higher for bat cells than human cells. Unfortunately, there is no literature addressing the efficiency of histone eviction in bat cells. Although we are not sure what accounts for this phenomenon, we demonstrated that the inhibiting ABCB1 efflux in bat cells was sufficient to trigger an accumulation of doxorubicin (Fig. 3, 5C , 7F, and 7H, and Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and doxorubicin dose-dependent histone eviction (Fig. 4) , suggesting that the expression and activity of ABCB1 in bat cells contributes to the distinct levels of \u03b3H2AX. Figure 1B are consistent with more rapid resolution of gamma H2AX in PaLung cells. Both WI-38 cells and PaLung cells have similar H2AX levels at t0. Once etoposide is removed, one would not expect new damage to occur for as long as 12 hours. Some discussion is needed with regard to why the data are not interpreted as reflective of more efficient repair in the PaLung cells.",

We think that residual intracellular etoposide remains in cells for a while even after it is removed from the culture media, which could induce further DNA damage, as similar to residual doxorubicin whose red fluorescence remains for some time after its removal from media. We expect that the concentration of residual intracellular etoposide in WI-38 cells is higher than in PaLung cells, since etoposide is a well-known substrate of ABCB1. Therefore, the patterns of \u03b3H2AX could reflect not only the rate of DNA repair, but also the DNA damage caused by residual intracellular etoposide. It is difficult to measure the levels of residual intracellular etoposide in each cell line at each time point, because etoposide does not have auto-fluorescence, unlike doxorubicin. Therefore, it is difficult to determine to what extent differential repair rates or residual etoposide-induced DNA damage contribute to the distinct resolution of \u03b3H2AX in WI-38 vs. PaLung cells. We cannot exclude the possibility that PaLung cells may have a superior mechanism to repair DNA damage toward etoposide. Therefore, from the data in Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 1C , we simply conclude that bat cells are more resistant than human cells to etoposide-induced DNA damage. We elaborate on the issue of the difficultly to compare the repair rate of DNA damage induced by the substrates of ABCB1 in the Discussion (line 406-417).

As we replied to question #1 and 2, we now examine the formation of 53BP1 foci in PaLung (bat), WI-38 (human), and MEF (mouse) cells after \u03b3-irradiation, as a measure of DNA damage levels and repair kinetics (Fig. 1B) . However, given that we performed the assay under only one condition (10 Gy of \u03b3-irradiation) and that there are many other ways to induce DNA damage and repairs, we removed this conclusion to avoid the over-interpreting our data and misleading the readers. We now emphasize that ABCB1-mediated efflux of genotoxins is a unique mechanism in bats to prevent DNA damage, which might contribute to their lower cancer incidence. (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 4) are carried out using a single pair of cell lines (WI-38 and PaLung), or compare several bat cell lines only to WI-38. Data for at least one additional human cell line (ideally primary human cells from a different tissue) should be added to these experiments.",

            "text": "We appreciate this valuable suggestion. We agree with the reviewer that the absolute amount of doxorubicin would be useful to assess the differences between the cell lines. However, unfortunately, there is no method to draw a standard curve to determine the actual amount of intracellular doxorubicin based on doxorubicin fluorescent intensity. The reason we showed relative value of doxorubicin fluorescence in the previous Fig. 3D , instead of showing mean fluorescent value as in the previous Fig. 2A , is because not all the cells were analysed by flow cytometry at the same day. Fluorescent intensity varies from day to day depending on the laser setting/condition of flow cytometry on each day. Therefore, using the raw value of fluorescent intensity does not provide an accurate comparison when data was collected under a different setting or on a different day. We couldn't perform a whole set of experiments in the previous Fig. 3D because it was difficult to obtain the primary bat cells from different tissues and species at the same time, and also because the number of cell lines to conduct was too large to complete all in one day. For the experiment in the previous Fig. 3D , we prepared a pair of cells (i.e. with or without verapamil treatment) at the same time for each cell line and performed flow cytometry assays. Therefore, we think that the comparison of the doxorubicin fold change after verapamil treatment is more reliable to evaluate the ABC transporter-dependent drug efflux, and decided to keep the original format of figure in new Fig. 7H . To further strengthen our conclusion of previous Fig. 2A , we added MEF (Fig. 2) , HEK293T and PaKiT03 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). 8. A positive control for detection of human ABCB1 with the antibody used in the immunoblot presented in Fig. 7 is needed to confirm the absence (or low levels) of the protein in human tissues.",

This has lead to a lot of speculation and attempts to tie in bat immunity and potential adaptation to flight (particularly in the discussion), which perhaps is warranted but the data presented here do not show or support these speculations. I recommend that this paper be resubmitted for another review, once rewritten with a different and more appropriate focus. While the mechanistic studies are exquisite and an example of what is required to establish novel model study species, the ecological and evolutionary aspects of bats presented in this paper are based on old literature that needs updating, sometimes is incorrect, misleading and needs a major rewrite. The results reported are important findings but they need to be correctly repackaged to reach their full impact and not mislead readers.

Instead, we focus on the discovery that bats have acquired a novel potential mechanism of cancer resistance. As discussed in a review by Seluanov et al, recent progress in the research of longlived animals has shed light on their unique cancer resistance mechanisms, such as highmolecular-mass hyaluronan secretion in naked mole rats, multiple copy of p53 in elephants, and concerted cell death in blind mole rats (Seluanov, A., et al. 2018) . Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of DNA damage resistance uniquely evolved in bats is valuable and could inform possible novel therapeutic strategies in cancer or chemoresistance. In the revised manuscript, we tried to explain our rationale for using bat as a model species to study novel mechanisms of DNA damage resistance. Seluanov, A., Gladyshev, V.

Consistent with the results from Pteropus alecto (Fig. 4) , these bat species also exhibited a doxorubicin dose-dependent induction of \u03b3H2AX, which were prevented by histone eviction once efflux activity was inhibited by verapamil.

Lab mice react in completely different fashion to their wild caught sister-species when faced with the same experimental conditions.

This is a little misleading and overarching as they only do one experiment on one bat species (Fig1A). They also seem to have a different interpretation of the findings of Podlutsky et al ref 31. The fact that bat cells respond like primate cells and not like mice cells is unexpected and shows that perhaps DDR in bats is unique given their body size.

            "text": "As stated in our reply to question #6, recent findings have revealed unique tumour suppression mechanisms that have evolved in several long-lived mammals. Our data implicate that the high and broad expression of ABCB1 could be a unique tumour suppression mechanism specifically evolved in bats, perhaps reflecting the need to efflux xenobiotic or even intercellular cytokines or metabolic by-products from cells, in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. We elaborated on how bats might have acquired the high and broad expression of ABCB1 in the Discussion (line 358-364 and line 373-378). Schinkel, A. H., et al. Disruption of the mouse mdr1a P-glycoprotein gene leads to a deficiency in the blood-brain barrier and to increased sensitivity to drugs. Cell 77, 491-502 (1994) . Schinkel, A. H., et al. Normal viability and altered pharmacokinetics in mice lacking mdr1-type (drugtransporting) P-glycoproteins. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 94, 4028-4033 (1997). 15. Discussion. Bats don't experience the majority of these toxic substances in the wild. The authors refer to cadmium as a naturally occurring substance. How often to bats experience this toxin? Again I'm not sure what selective pressure would have driven this adaptation in the bat ancestor? The evolution of the ABCB1 expression should predate the massive expansion into all these niches, a pre-adaptation which has allowed bats to expand? But then why did it evolve in the first place? Again the authors must reconsider and further explore this rationale.",

This really is misleading. Also the tenuous link between ABCB1 and anti-inflammation/immunity mechanisms needs to be clarified. It might be correct but there are no data to show this here. I think reporting their new findings in light of these other speculated adaptations is a little contrived. I'm not sure that this brings anything more to this paper and may even dilute the results.",

            "text": "We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As mentioned in our response to question #7, we have added new data, including an analysis of MEFs. Based on our immunofluorescence staining of 53BP1, we did not observe significant differences in DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and its repair kinetics between WI-38 and PaLung cells after 10 Gy of \u03b3-irradiation, whereas MEFs were slower in responding to and repairing DNA damage compared to WI-38 and PaLung cells (Fig. 1B) . High doses of \u03b3-irradiation, such as 10 Gy used in this study, mainly cause DSBs (Kavanagh, J. N., et al. 2013) . DSBs are the most detrimental form of DNA breaks for cells and most DSBs are repaired via non-homologous end-joining (Mao, Z., et al. 2008; Kakarougkas, A. and Jeggo, P. A. 2014) . 53BP1 is recruited to damaged DNA to facilitate non-homologous end-joining repair and is released upon repair (Panier, S. and Boulton, S. J. 2014; Croco, E., et al. 2017) . Our results suggest that the DDR for double strand breaks might be better in humans and bats than in mice, perhaps similar to base excision repair (BER) that was observed by Podlutsky et al as the reviewer mentions.We agree with the reviewer that our limited results do not exclude that alterations to the DDR pathway contribute to the increased DNA damage resistance. In the revised manuscript, as the reviewer suggested, we deleted these statements to avoid misleading the reader and over-interpreting our results. We also discuss the results from Podlutsky's group regarding the DNA damage repair pathways in different species (Podlutsky, A., et al. 2008) (line 390-396).",
