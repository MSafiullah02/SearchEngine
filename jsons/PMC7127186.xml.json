It has been estimated that around 60% of the infectious organisms pathogenic to humans are zoonotic and that 75% of the all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (Cleaveland et al., 2001, Taylor et al., 2001, Haydon et al., 2002, Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Zoonotic diseases can cause endemic disease with long term social and economic effects or dramatic impact and acute disease outbreaks leading to high mortality and morbidity. Recent outbreaks of emerging zoonotic diseases have demonstrated the potential seriousness and widespread exposure that can occur with such pathogens.",

They are likely to be amongst the first people to encounter animals infected with zoonotic pathogens and to engage in high-risk interactions with them. And indeed, infection rates among animal health professionals are high. For example, around 30\u201340% of the veterinarians surveyed in two studies in the USA reported having been infected with zoonotic diseases (Schnurrenberger et al., 1978, Lipton et al., 2008). The proportions of veterinarians suffering from zoonotic diseases have been reported to be as high as 60\u201365% in two other studies conducted in the UK and South Africa (Constable and Harrington, 1982, Gummow, 2003). Veterinarians are at a particularly greater risk when investigating or controlling emerging infectious disease outbreaks as evident in the Dutch outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza virus (Koopmans et al., 2004).",

Limited studies conducted to date indicate that awareness of zoonotic disease risks and uptake of infection control practices is very low among veterinary practices and veterinarians as individuals (Jensen and Lings, 1999, Lipton et al., 2008, Wright et al., 2008).

            "text": "Veterinary work environment was also a significant factor for adequate use of PPE, as those working in referral clinics, laboratory, government or research environments were 2.7 times more likely to use adequate PPE than those working in private practice. This is probably due to the corporate nature of most non-private organizations which can be reasonably expected to have corporate occupational health standards and protocols covering all aspects of operations, of which PPE would be just one consideration. An association has previously been documented between having infection control committees (overseeing infection control programs) in veterinary teaching hospitals and these hospitals having written policy documents on infection control (Benedict et al., 2008). Such programs are expected to be less likely in private veterinary practices, particularly smaller private practices with lower staff numbers. Murphy et al. (2010) also present evidence of this with none of 101 community veterinary clinics in southern Ontario having an infection control program. Similarly, a significant association between the absence of a written infection control policy in the work place and a low precaution awareness (based on reported likelihood to take protective action) was identified among small animal and equine veterinarians in the United States (Wright et al., 2008). Given that 79.9% of the veterinarians in this survey worked in a private veterinary practice, the level of implementation of strict biosecurity protocols in the majority of veterinary workplaces is questionable and an area of concern.",

There was a similar but non-significant trend for equine veterinarians (Table 2). In contrast, in the US study by Wright et al. (2008), fewer large animal and equine veterinarians reported always washing their hands before eating, drinking or smoking at work than small animal practitioners. In that study, most small animal and equine veterinarians but fewer than half of the large animal practitioners reported always isolating the patient and restricting human access when dealing with an animal suspected of having a serious zoonotic disease. Further investigations are required to understand the reasons for differences in adequate use of PPE in different practice types but the results of this study support the findings from research conducted in human health settings which show that uptake of infection control practices is influenced by a complex combination of institutional, logistical, social, and psychological factors (Whitby et al., 2007).",

Veterinarians\u2019 use of PPE is associated with their perception of the risks, and their determination of risk must necessarily be grounded in their knowledge base and their attitudes, such as their ability to control the threat. Increasing information may help to bring veterinarians\u2019 use of PPE more closely in line with zoonotic disease risks. Good quality training can strengthen our communal knowledge about zoonotic disease risks and improve the quality of decision making about PPE use in different practice contexts. Further equipping veterinarians with a framework for risk assessment and risk management (such as presented in the AVA Guidelines for Veterinary Personal Biosecurity) provides a decision tree to assess and implement appropriate action to prevent pathogen transmission in any animal disease context. This is the approach needed to improve the quality of decision making by veterinarians regarding the use of PPE to address their zoonotic disease exposure risks.",

Veterinary workplaces will have to change their culture by proactively training and supporting their staff in infection control practices including the use of PPE. Better education, awareness of the risk of zoonotic diseases and of options to manage this risk and liability issues could drive uptake of infection control practices. Veterinarians who do not consider PPE in the course of their daily work are failing in their duty of care (AVA, 2001) to adopt work practices that do not expose themselves, their staff and others to avoidable risk of zoonotic diseases. Targeted education of veterinarians about zoonotic disease risks is needed, along with a widespread campaign to increase awareness amongst veterinarians of the industry guidelines and standards relating to zoonotic disease, infection control programs, as well as their liabilities and legal responsibilities.",
