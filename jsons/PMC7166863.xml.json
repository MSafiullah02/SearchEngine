It was estimated that COPD was the fifth leading cause of worldwide death in 2001 and will become the third leading cause by 2020.\n8\n Aging of the world's population and the continued use of tobacco are thought to be responsible for the growing burden of COPD.\n8\n Using the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)<70% with symptoms of cough and sputum production), an international study demonstrated that the odds ratio (OR) for the diagnosis of stage II or higher COPD was 1.94 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.80\u20132.10) per 10\u2010year increment of age.\n9\n This compares with the OR for developing stage II or higher COPD of 1.20 (95% CI=1.14\u20131.25) for each 10 pack\u2010years of smoking.\n9\n The adult prevalence found in this large worldwide study was 10.1% overall, 11.8% for men and 8.5% for women, for stage II or higher COPD.\n9\n Because normal lung aging results in obstructive changes, caution in interpreting spirometry of older adults is warranted. Adjustment of the GOLD criteria have been made and suggest that, in patients aged 70 and older, the normal FEV1/FVC ratio should be reduced from 70% to 65% to account for the normal aging process.\n10\n\n",

This response is prolonged over years and decades and is linked to lung tissue remodeling. Remodeling is also associated with CB with small\u2010airway bronchiolitis.\n2\n The resultant air flow limitations lead to hyperinflation of the lung and air trapping in COPD.

The acute use of inhaled bronchodilators represents a mainstay of treatment in patients with evidence of airway obstruction. Short\u2010acting inhaled beta2\u2010agonists appear to be the preferred initial bronchodilator for the treatment of AECOPD, although prospective placebo\u2010controlled trials have not been performed.\n48\n The short\u2010acting anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide can be added to the treatment regiment. A meta\u2010analysis has shown that, in AECOPD, there is no significant difference between the results of inhaled short\u2010acting beta2\u2010agonists or short\u2010acting anticholinergics.\n49\n Although commonly used, the combination of a short\u2010acting beta2\u2010agonist with a short\u2010acting anticholinergic has not uniformly been shown to improve outcomes in AECOPD.\n48\n, \n49\n Nebulizer\u2010based delivery of these agents appears to be as effective as using a metered\u2010dose inhaler with a spacer in patients with AECOPD.\n48\n The use of intravenous aminophylline, a methylxanthine, in the treatment of AECOPD is controversial, and no consistent benefits have been demonstrated.\n48\n The frequent presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular comorbidities in elderly patients with AECOPD, must be considered before using high\u2010dose inhaled beta2\u2010agonist treatment or intravenous methylxanthines.\n50\n, \n51\n Ensuring appropriate but not excessive hydration of older patients with exacerbations of COPD or CB can reduce the thickness of the sputum and aid clearance. Supplemental oxygen therapy to ensure an arterial oxygen tension greater than 60 mmHg has been advocated.\n48\n A recent meta\u2010analysis of the treatment of AECOPD has demonstrated that systemic corticosteroids are effective in reducing treatment failures and that the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can reduce the need for intubation and mortality.\n52\n\n",
