Secondary outcomes included parenteral nutrition (PN) duration and length of stay (LOS). Study design Retrospective study of 44 infants with gastroschisis examined demographics, gastroschisis type, PN days, timing of nutrition milestones, feeding composition, and LOS. Results MOM dose was significantly associated with shorter time to discharge from feeding initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for discharge per 10% increase in MOM dose, 1.111; 95% CI, 1.011-1.220, p = 0.029). MOM dose was also significantly associated with shorter LOS (adjusted HR for discharge per 10% increase in MOM dose, 1.130; 95% CI, 1.028-1.242, p = 0.011). Conclusions MOM dose was significantly associated with a decrease in time to discharge from feeding initiation and LOS in a dose-dependent manner. Mothers of gastroschisis patients should receive education and proactive lactation support to optimize MOM volume for feedings.",

Forty-nine neonates with gastroschisis met these criteria and were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Five of these 49 were excluded (see Fig. 1 ). Three infants were excluded due to incomplete database as there was inadequate documentation in the paper medical record regarding composition of daily feedings. One infant was excluded due to concern for perinatal asphyxia resulting in transfer of care soon after birth for selective head cooling. Six infants had complex gastroschisis. One of these infants had intestinal obstruction, underwent multiple surgeries, and was ultimately transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with liver failure/cholestasis for evaluation for small bowel/liver transplant. This patient was excluded due to complexity of illness. Due to our relatively small cohort, we chose to include the other five infants with complex gastroschisis, although these complex cases exhibit different clinical courses independent of enteral feeding strategy [18, 19] .

Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to determine the adjusted association between MOM dose as a continuous variable and time from initiation of feeding to discharge. Covariates included in the model were simple versus complex gastroschisis [19] , birth gestational age [21] , and year of birth to account for any changes in practice over the course of the study period. A secondary analysis was conducted to evaluate two specific cut-points for MOM dose: (1) >50% MOM versus \u226450% MOM, and (2) 100% MOM versus 0-99% MOM. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was performed using the same covariates to determine the adjusted association between MOM dose and the secondary outcomes of PN duration and LOS. MOM dose was evaluated as a continuous variable and as the two dichotomous MOM dose categories. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS \u00ae Statistics software version 26 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Significance was set at \u03b1 < 0.05.",

Gulack et al. found a clear benefit from being fed human milk on 100% of fed days or on 51-99% of fed days with a shorter time from initiation of feedings to hospital discharge compared with receiving no human milk. Interestingly, they found that receiving human milk on 1-50% of feeding days was associated with a longer time from initiation of feeds to discharge than being fed 0% human milk, which the authors attributed to incomplete adjustment for severity of illness. Specifically, they were unable to adjust for complexity of gastroschisis, which has been shown to impact outcomes in infants with gastroschisis [21] .",

Given that the infants with gastroschisis do not receive enteral feedings immediately after birth and are often maintained nil per os for several weeks, their mothers must rely on breast pumps to initiate and maintain lactation. Recent qualitative research demonstrates that these mothers report suboptimal lactation education and support [24] . Many NICUs have developed strategies to improve lactation care for mothers of premature infants. It is equally important to address the unique needs of mothers of infants with surgical conditions. Currently our NICU limits use of donor human milk to very low birth weight infants (birth weight <1500 g) and preterm infants born at <32 weeks gestational age for feeding in lieu of formula when MOM is not available. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial of donor human milk feedings in infants with gastroschisis has been published, although clinical trials have been completed and are in progress.",
