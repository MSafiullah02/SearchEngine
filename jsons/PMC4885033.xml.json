Several public and nongovernmental organizations have focused resources on defining and addressing health disparities and health equity and developed and implemented service models to increase health equity (Dahlgren & Whitehead, 2007; Granado-Villar et al., 2010). Given world population growth and increasing disparities, health inequities are more apparent. A primary component of sustainable development practice focuses on economic, social, and physical well-being. Medicine, public health, environmental science, and other health disciplines have developed curricula to educate scholars and practitioners. There is a growing trend in social work education to expand master\u2019s and doctoral curricula in the areas of global health, sustainable development, and global practice (Williams, Chapa, & Des Marais, 2013).",

There was a realization by the health community that there were health issues larger than the scope of any single country. The spread of plague, smallpox, and cholera were linked to the growth of transborder trade and travel; the efficiencies of modern technology applied to warfare increased the death and devastation of military violence, not just within the battlefield, but also against civilian populations. Recent events involving Ebola, Zika virus, Rift Valley fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and other infectious diseases remind us of the continuous impact of the transborder spread of infections and illnesses. A zoonotic disease passed between animals and humans is very common. It is estimated that more than six out of every 10 infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).",

The Plague of Justinian ravaged the Byzantine Empire in the sixth century. Following merchant trade routes from Egypt to Constantinople, then from port to port, it spread through Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy (Haensch et al., 2010). A second pandemic, the Black Death, ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1750, killing nearly one-third of Europeans (Haensch et al., 2010). A third plague pandemic traveled from Yunnan to Hong Kong, and then once again spread globally along trade routes in the second half of the 19th century (Haensch et al., 2010). Deoxyribonucleic acid and protein testing shows that all three of these pandemics were caused by strains of the same agent Yersinia pestis (Haensch et al., 2010).",

By the late 1980s, WHO was in a crisis as a result of the World Health Assembly freezing its budget and the United States cutting its payments to the United Nations (Brown et al., 2006). The World Bank focused more and more on issues of development and private-sector health from its neoliberal perspective; by the early 1990s, its loans surpassed WHO\u2019s entire budget (Brown et al., 2006). However, WHO still retained the technical expertise in health care that the World Bank lacked, making the two necessary partners (Brown et al., 2006).",

This evolved into today\u2019s network of organizations that support international education and research opportunities (Evert et al., 2008). As a result, opportunities to study or practice globally have increased, as has the interest of researchers. The growth of global health education and research has been supported by the ongoing development of a transnational infrastructure. One of the first conferences devoted to education and international health was held in 1948. The International Health Medical Education Consortium was established in 1991 and eventually became today\u2019s GHEC (Chase & Evert, 2011). It currently has more than 90 member institutions throughout the United States and Canada. The Global Health Action Committee of the American Medical Student Association was formalized in 1997, and in 1998 the International Federation of Medical Students\u2019 Association founded its U.S. chapter (Chase & Evert, 2011). Many other academic fields, including social work, law, and engineering are collaborating in the field of global health and global health education (Chase & Evert, 2011; Koplan et al., 2009).",
