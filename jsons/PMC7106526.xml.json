Small-molecule enzyme inhibitors have transformed human medicine and it is estimated to comprise roughly one-third to half of all marketed drugs [2]. Since the importance of bioactive lipids has been recognized [3], a great attention has been devoted to enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) are a superfamily of enzymes [4] characterized by their ability to hydrolyze the ester bond at the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids releasing free fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (AA), and initiating the eicosanoids cascade [5]. As a matter of fact, PLA2s are the upstream regulators of the eicosanoid cascade supplying free fatty acids to cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450 enzymes, which thus produce various inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes. Because of their involvement in the development and progression of numerous inflammatory diseases [4,6], PLA2s have attracted a great interest as medicinal targets for more than twenty years. As a consequence, many small-molecule synthetic inhibitors have been developed in both academia and pharmaceutical companies [4].",

However, four types of human PLA2s have been targeted for the development of synthetic inhibitors as new medicinal agents: GIVA cPLA2, sPLA2, cytosolic GVIA iPLA2 and lipoprotein-associated PLA2 (LpPLA2 or GVII PLA2). The various classes of small-molecule synthetic PLA2 inhibitors are summarized in two recent review articles [7,8]. Apart from their importance as new potential therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases, small-molecule PLA2 inhibitors are excellent tools to unveil the role that each PLA2 type plays in cells and in vivo.",

This enzyme is widely distributed in cells throughout most types of human tissue and it exhibits a marked preference for hydrolysis of AA at the sn-2 position of phospholipid substrates. GIVA cPLA2 is an 85 kDa protein that is regulated by intracellular calcium. It contains 749 amino acids and consists of an N-terminal C2 domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The crystal structure of GIVA cPLA2 was solved in 1999 by Dessen et al. [9] For the hydrolysis of its substrate phospholipid, the catalytic domain of GIVA cPLA2 utilizes an unusual catalytic dyad, Ser-228/Asp-549, located in the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain [10,11]. In a recent review article, Leslie has reviewed the role of cytosolic PLA2 in normal physiological processes and disease [12].",

Avexxin has also claimed 2-oxothiazoles and related compounds as anti-inflammatory agents acting through the inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 and AA release [20]. AVX235 (4, Fig. 1, known also as GK470) is a potent inhibitor of GIVA cPLA2 (X\nI(50) value of 0.011 mol fraction in a mixed micelle assay and IC50 of 300 nM in a vesicle assay), which was found to suppress the release of AA with an IC50 value of 0.6 \u03bcM, in SW982 fibroblast-like synoviocytes [21]. This inhibitor exhibited in vivo anti-inflammatory effects comparable to the reference drugs methotrexate and Enbrel in a prophylactic and in a therapeutic collagen-induced arthritis model, respectively. More recently, the anti-angiogenic effects of this inhibitor, in a patient-derived triple-negative basal-like breast cancer model was evaluated and significant tumor growth inhibition was observed after 8 days of treatment [22]. Decreased endothelial cell proliferation and fewer immature vessels in treated tumors were shown by histology.",

This class of inhibitors having 1,2,4-trisubstituted pyrrolidine framework was developed in 2000 by Seno et al. at Shionogi [25]. Both of these inhibitors are commercially available and have been used as tools to understand the role of the enzyme. RSC-3388 exhibited an IC50 value of 1.8 nM in a PC/DOG assay [25], while pyrrophenone was found to be a potent and reversible inhibitor of human GIVA cPLA2 (IC50 4.2 nM), that strongly inhibits AA release, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) formation in human whole blood [26]. A combination of extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experimental results was developed as a tool to define more accurate binding sites. Following such a methodology, it has been demonstrated that pyrrophenone is bound to the enzyme through numerous hydrophobic residues located distal from the active site, more precisely bound in the cap region near the interfacial binding surface of the enzyme [27].",

This off-target effect, implicating a serine hydrolase in regulation of ER calcium release, highlights the importance of careful dose-response studies with pyrrophenone to study GIVA cPLA2 function. The role of GIVA cPLA2 in local and systemic disease during S. pneumonia infection was investigated and it was demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 by RSC-3388 blocked Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced polymorphonuclear cells transepithelial migration in vitro [29]. Those results suggest that the enzyme plays a crucial role in eliciting pulmonary inflammation during pneumococcal infection. GIVA cPLA2 has been shown to increase and mediate various activities in several human cancers including colon, prostate and lung cancers [[30], [31], [32]]. Most recently, the expression level of the enzyme in breast cancer cells in the absence and presence of doxorubicin, and in patients before and after chemotherapy was studied. It was found that blockage of GIVA cPLA2 by either RSC-3388 or pyrrophenone sensitized aggressive breast cancer to doxorubicin through suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinases [33]. Thus, inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 may be of therapeutic value to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer.",

In a recent work, they studied in detail structurally related compounds as dual inhibitors of GIVA cPLA2 and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Bioisosteric replacement of the carboxylic acid functionality of 1-(5-carboxyindazol-1-yl)propan-2-ones by inverse amides, sulfonylamides, carbamates and ureas showed that the carboxylic acid functionality of the lead compounds is of special importance for a pronounced inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 and FAAH [37]. Since the serine reactive ketone functionality of such compounds is readily metabolized to inactive alcohol derivatives, this moiety was replaced by \u03b1-ketoheterocycle, cyanamide and nitrile serine traps, in an effort to obtain metabolically stable inhibitors. However, studies of the inhibitory activity and metabolic stability of these substances revealed that in all cases an increased metabolic stability was accompanied by a loss of inhibitory potency against GIVA cPLA2 and FAAH [38]. Structure-activity relationship studies on 1-(2-oxopropyl)indole-5-carboxylic acids explored the effect of butanoyl and hexanoyl substituents in position 3 of the indole scaffold bearing terminal groups of varying polarity [39]. The inhibitory potency was not considerably affected in most cases, while metabolic phase I and phase II in vitro stability and aqueous solubility were influenced and modulated by the structural modifications performed.",

They are the most widespread PLA2s throughout human tissues. The first and most widely described member of this family, GVIA iPLA2 (also known as iPLA2\u03b2), purified from macrophages in 1994 [52], also possesses lysophospholipase, transacylase and acyl-CoA thioesterase activity [53,54]. According to homology models and sequence alignments, the lipid hydrolysis is executed by a Ser/Asp catalytic dyad and the sequence consists of a linker region, seven ankyrin repeats and a catalytic domain [55]. Very recently, the crystal structure of GVIA iPLA2 revealed that the protein forms a stable dimer mediated by catalytic domains with both active sites in close proximity, positioned for cooperative activation and internal transacylation [56]. Both active sites of the dimer are wide open and provide sufficient space for phospholipids to access the catalytic centers. The ankyrin repeat domains are oriented toward the membrane-binding interface, so that they can interact with membrane proteins. The structure of GVIA iPLA2 monomer (PDB ID: 6AUN) is presented in Fig. 2\n. The missing loops were filled with Modeller [57] and the residues of the active site are represented with balls (yellow: C atoms, red: O atoms, blue: N atoms, white: H atoms).",

When administrated to spontaneous diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, FKGK18 was found to significantly decrease incidence of diabetes in association with reduced insulitis, improved glucose homeostasis, higher circulating insulin, and preservation of \u03b2-cell area. Moreover, FKGK18 reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) production from CD4+ T-cells and antibodies from B-cells, suggesting modulation of immune cell responses by iPLA2\u03b2 or GVIA iPLA2-derived products. Further, adoptive transfer of diabetes by CD4+ T-cells to immunodeficient and nondiabetogenic NOD.scid mice was moderated by FKGK18 pretreatment and TNF\u03b1 production from CD4+ T-cells was reduced by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX) and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX).

More specifically, pyrrolidine-1 was used as a GIVA cPLA2 inhibitor, LY329722 as a sPLA2 (group X) inhibitor, while BEL and FKGK18 as GVIA iPLA2 inhibitors. According to the results, GVIA iPLA2 is crucial for spontaneous AR, both GVIA iPLA2 and GX sPLA2 are involved in P4-induced AR, while GIVA cPLA2 is dispensable in both types [67]. Moreover, progesterone-induced AR was found to be a long lasting process, spreading over 30 min in the mouse and kinetic analyses suggest the presence of different sperm subpopulations, using distinct PLA2 pathways to achieve AR. At low physiological P4 concentration (2 \u03bcM), sperm undergoing early AR (0\u20135 min post-P4) rely on GVIA iPLA2, whereas sperm undergoing late AR (20\u201330 min post-P4) rely on GX sPLA2. The role of PLA2s in AR seemed to depend on P4 concentration, with the PLA2s being key actors at low physiological P4 concentrations (\u22642 \u03bcM), but not at higher ones (~10 \u03bcM).",

Over the years, BEL has been used to discern the involvement of GVIA iPLA2 in biological processes at cellular level as well as in vivo. However, several features of BEL decrease its feasibility for in cells and in vivo use: (a) irreversible inhibition of iPLA2, (b) inactivation of other serine proteases, and (c) high toxicity due to its interaction with cysteines. In 2016, it was reported that iPLA2\u03b2 and iPLA2\u03b3 are expressed and are active in murine cells of the osteoblastic phenotype and that their inhibition with BEL results in an initial increase in PGE2 formation, due to iPLA2-independent AA accumulation, followed by a decrease at higher BEL concentrations [74]. Moreover, BEL seems to react with intracellular cysteine and glutathione leading to glutathione depletion, which is responsible for the decrease in PGE2 production. These findings suggest that BEL must be used with caution in a cellular environment, since all data presented resemble conditions of extreme oxidative stress.",

They are typically small proteins (14\u201318 kDa), which require Ca2+ in mM concentration for their catalytic activity. They utilize an Asp/His dyad in the active site and they are stabilized by six common disulfide bonds and one or two variable additional ones. Individual members of sPLA2s exhibit unique tissue and cellular distributions and enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct biological roles. They can act either by catalyzing reactions as enzymes or by binding to receptors and hence, they are involved in the activation of several biological pathways. Maintaining sPLA2 homeostasis appears critical for several physiological functions, as up-regulation or down-regulation of the expression of some sPLA2 isoforms is related to pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, immune disorders and cancer, as summarized in several review articles [[78], [79], [80]]. As a result, a variety of synthetic inhibitors targeting sPLA2 have been developed [4,7,8,13].",

GVIIA PLA2 associates with both low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) in human plasma, which led to the name lipoprotein-associated PLA2 (LpPLA2) [103]. LpPLA2 is a calcium independent, secreted extracellularly enzyme of 45 kDa, which uses the catalytic triad Ser/His/Asp [104]. LpPLA2 shows broad substrate specificity; apart from PAF, it can also hydrolyze phosphatidylcholines with short-chain sn-2 residues, as well as oxidized phospholipids [105]. When cloned from human plasma in 1995, it was shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in vivo [106]; however subsequent clinical studies of LpPLA2 levels in patients established this enzyme as a definitive marker of coronary heart disease [107]. Recently, a reagent for measuring LpPLA2 activity received FDA approval [108]. Elevated levels of LpPLA2 are associated with coronary heart disease and stroke [109,110]. Thus, further research is crucial for the development of new inhibitors of LpPLA2.",

Recently, darapladib was found to reduce elevated LpPLA2, Rho kinase activity, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in atherosclerosis, which can lead to cardiovascular protection [114]. In an in vivo rat type 2 diabetes mellitus model, darapladib was proven to reduce inflammation [115], to decrease vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecules-1 aorta expression in early stages of atherosclerosis [116] and to improve insulin resistance occurring in the metabolic disorder [117]. Moreover, investigation of the effects of chronic diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia on pig retina revealed increased permeability of the blood-retina barrier (BRB) coupled with alterations in retinal architecture, including a leak of plasma components into the retina, selective immunoglobulin G binding to neurons in the ganglion cell layer, thinning of retinal layers due to cell loss and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in M\u00fcller cells, which were all curtailed by treatment with darapladib [118].",

Briefly, structural investigation into the LpPLA2/darapladib and LpPLA2/32 complexes identified a fairly open, large, relatively hydrophobic and rigid binding pocket. Key interactions between inhibitors and LpPLA2 were revealed. The structure of LpPLA2 proved very rigid and the binding of darapladib and 32 (Fig. 5) into LpPLA2 did not change the overall conformation of the protein. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed that the binding of these two inhibitors to LpPLA2 is driven by enthalpic effects while the influence of entropy on the binding is negative [120].",

Rilapladib has completed a phase \u0399\u0399a study [121] to evaluate its effect in AD, where it demonstrated improved cognitive outcomes and changes to a number of mechanism- and disease-related biomarkers, suggesting that rilapladib and inhibition of LpPLA2 may have the potential to slow the progression of AD and alter the underlying pathology in a subpopulation of AD patients with neuroimaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease [122]. GSK2647544 has been evaluated as for the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers in phase 1 clinical trials [123]. The compound was generally well tolerated and had a reasonable PK-PD profile [124]. In order to refine therapeutic dose predictions and confirm brain penetration, a radiolabelled form of the inhibitor [18F]GSK2647544 was manufactured for use in a PET biodistribution phase \u0399 study [125]. According to the results, GSK2647544 is able to cross the blood brain barrier and enter the human brain.

This inhibitory effect was comparable to intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) neutralization and the protection against BRB dysfunction was additive when both targets were inhibited simultaneously. Mechanistic studies in primary brain and retinal microvascular endothelial cells, as well as occluded rat pial microvessels, showed that luminal but not abluminal LPC potently induced permeability and that this required signaling by the VEGF receptor 2. The results suggested that LpPLA2 could be an efficacious therapeutic target for diabetic macular edema (DME), either alone or in combination with anti-VEGF therapeutics [128].",

This study highlighted the importance of the interactions between protein-membrane for the substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Since an X-ray structure was not available at that time, a homology model of GVIA iPLA2 was created. The results showed that the polar head of the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) occupies the hydrophilic area close to the catalytic center. The phosphate group creates a hydrogen bond with Arg200 in GIVA cPLA2 and Lys489 in GVIA iPLA2 and the carbonyl group at the sn-2 position is located near the catalytic Ser288 in GIVA cPLA2 and Ser519 in GVIA iPLA2.

The colorimetric assay proved to be accurate and robust with acceptable linearity through a wide range of activity levels, allowing for adoption of LpPLA2 activity in clinical practice [108]. Most recently, a novel enzymatic method for assaying LpPLA2 in serum has been developed [147]. This LpPLA2 activity assay used 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-rac-glycero-3 phosphocholine (rac C16 PAF) as a substrate, which was hydrolyzed by LpPLA2 to produce 1-O-hexadecyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LysoPAF). LysoPAF was then hydrolyzed by lysoplasmalogen-specific phospholipase D (lysophospholipase D) to generate choline, which was detected by choline oxidase. Regression analysis of LpPLA2 activity measured by the enzymatic LpPLA2 activity assay vs. two chemical LpPLA2 activity assays, i.e. LpPLA2 FS and PLAC\u00ae test, and ELISA, gave the following correlation coefficients: 0.990, 0.893 and 0.785, respectively (n = 30).",

The trials for sPLA2 inhibitors varespladib and varespladib methyl failed to exhibit the expected in vivo efficacy, while the cPLA2 inhibitor giripladib caused undesired side effects. Recent results showing high-level of sPLA2 inhibition by varespladib and varespladib methyl against 28 medically important snake venoms [87] suggest that these sPLA2 inhibitors may find use in initiating the treatment of snakebite in the pre-hospital environment. In the case of cPLA2 inhibitors, as we previously noticed, the high lipophilicity of the known cPLA2 inhibitors is a serious drawback. Thus, it seems that such inhibitors may be more suitable for topical use, for example for the treatment of dermatitis, rather than for systemic use. Fortunately, potent cPLA2 inhibitors having ClogP values lower than 5, for example 2-oxoesters, have been recently discovered [48]. As for LpPLA2 enzyme, the failure of the potent LpPLA2 inhibitor darapladib to reduce the risk of major coronary events, as demonstrated in both STABILITY and SOLID-TIMI 52 phase III studies, indicates that the enzyme may be a biomarker of vascular inflammation rather than a target for pharmaceutical treatment with beneficial effects.",

For example, most recently a combination of LC/MS lipidomics and MD simulations revealed surprising and previously unrecognized substrate specificity for sPLA2 and iPLA2. It is expected that advanced analytical lipidomic approaches and computational methods may contribute to increase our knowledge on the PLA2 superfamily of enzymes. In addition, the recently solved crystal structure of GVIA iPLA2 may help in designing novel inhibitors for this enzyme. Classical medicinal chemistry approaches, including organic synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies, as well as modern approaches employing functional lipidomics and computer-aided drug design may provide new chemical entities as potential novel pharmaceutical agents.",
