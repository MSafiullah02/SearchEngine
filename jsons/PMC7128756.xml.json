The mid-1970s, for scientific minds, just came after two successive periods of change: one of discovery and the other of questioning. Each built an undeniable pressure on those involved in science monitoring and policy design. It needs to be recalled that a couple of decades only had elapsed since major discoveries had been made, which any informed observer would describe as having the potential to revolutionise the understanding of living beings and of their complex properties. In 1953, Watson and Crick unravelled the double helix structure of the DNA molecule [2], while in 1961, Monod and Jacob elucidated the regulation of protein synthesis [3]. In 1962, Arber discovered bacterial restriction enzymes having the capacity to dissect the DNA molecule in an entirely predictable way [4]. And in 1969, a \u2018gene\u2019, in other words a theoretical concept hypothesised from experimental evidence over about a century, was isolated from a bacterium in its molecular form for the first time by Shapiro et al. [5]. The authors of this report, like most of their peers, had to deliberate over this accumulation of paradigm-changing discoveries about the most intimate functioning of living beings.",

It corresponded to the early 1970s, during which time scientific elites all over the world were addressing the responsibilities of researchers in molecular and cellular biology and the potential for fully mastering the most vital processes involved in the replication of life itself and, ultimately, the generation of new living forms. This was a rather frenzied period, stretching from 1970 and a conference on \u2018The social impact of modern biology\u2019 under the auspices of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science, through the 1974 Paul Berg initiative for a voluntary two-year moratorium on recombinant DNA research, to the 1975 Asilomar Conference that put forward guidelines for regulating recombinant DNA research. These could all be seen as unilateral initiatives of scientists or science-funding agencies, sometimes with the support of their governments, to raise fundamental societal issues, notably those speculating on risks associated with the application of recombinant DNA technology. However, they all took place in rather closed and specialist circles.",

In 1975, there was no such a thing as a \u2018research and innovation policy\u2019 for the EC. Put simply, research was not yet formally recognised as a Community competence as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was. References to research existed marginally in the Coal and Steel Treaty as well as in the EURATOM Treaty. Under those treaties, budgetary appropriations were foreseen for ancillary research activities. Under the Treaty of Rome however, assuming a political momentum had existed, the only way to invite Community research was to invoke an Article stipulating that the Commission would be justified to put forward ad hoc initiatives when necessary, if other chapters of the Treaty did not provide adequate provisions. This timid opening had actually been the starting point for small medical research and agricultural research programmes during the sixties and seventies, which excluded direct funding and limited the intervention of the Commission to coordinate relevant national research work.",

The Cold War was having a visible impact, in particular in relation to public support to science and technology and, most explicitly, on modern biology. The efforts of the Soviet Bloc to master technological advances were mirrored in Western Europe, with the overt support of the USA, to capture the best brains on the west of the Iron Curtain. This was the origin of international treaties and conventions, for example, to establish CERN (Organisation europ\u00e9enne sur la recherche nucl\u00e9aire) in Geneva on particle physics, EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) in Heidelberg around molecular biology and EMBO (European Molecular Biology Organisation). It also gave rise to NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) scientific fellowships and was influential in designing the EURATOM Treaty as well as allowing the creation of a multi-site Joint Research Centre for the EC. These developments took place with a view to developing peaceful and safe uses of nuclear power and, in some way, there was much more EC money readily available through the EURATOM Radiation Protection Programme for European collaborative research in biology than could have been expected at that time under the Rome Treaty.",

            "text": "The Biomolecular Engineering Programme (BEP) was launched in 1982 and driven by a deliberate technology push, maybe na\u00efve but in tune with the formidable new methods used by bench scientists working with living organisms. The BEP was initially built around two main areas, namely second generation bioreactors, and genetic engineering for agriculture and the agro-food industry. The reason for such a narrow scope was due firstly to the limited funding available and secondly because, at that time Member States were of the view that health related biotechnology would have to remain an exclusive remit of academic institutions and industries with a strong national base. In addition, more than two-thirds of the overall EC budget went on financing the CAP and, hence, an obvious driver for research benefitting agriculture. As the Treaty of Rome did not yet define any specific mandate for EC research, a precautionary wording restricted the eligibility of funding to the so-called \u2018pre-competitive\u2019 domain. The wording is legally binding but, at the same time, equivocal in different linguistic versions. The pre-competitive criterion may have acted like a warning, but in two different directions. Initially, it was the most orthodox interpretation to admit that research funded through BEP should never be seen as competitive. \u2018Pre-competitive\u2019 simply meant non-competitive. As this small programme proceeded, other voices started to argue that \u2018pre-competitive\u2019 also meant a condition that just precedes the conversion to competitiveness, or in a more informal way that \u2018pre-competitive research\u2019 is where industrial competitors feel able to collaborate. These different interpretations rapidly disappeared as soon as comprehensive Framework Programmes became established from the mid-1980s, and an explicit justification for EC research was introduced in the Treaties, starting with the Single European Act. At this point in time, EC research became invited with the specific purpose \u2018to strengthen the scientific and technological basis of European industry and to encourage it to become more competitive at international level\u2019\n[12].",

In particular, this small programme opened the era of technology-driven initiatives, capable of breaking through the academic boundaries of more traditional disciplines. It also became the place for designing ambitious proposal evaluation procedures, based on independent international peer review, under the scrutiny of a programme committee composed of representatives of the Member States. Last but not least, the programme hosted in those early days a training scheme parallel to project funding, which convincingly pointed to the vital need to boost scientific mobility across frontiers as a mechanism fostering excellence. In a sense, the BEP can claim \u2013 together with information technology programmes renamed in the meantime \u2018Esprit\u2019 \u2013 to be the prototype think-tank and test bench for the structure and operational rules of the newly designed, all encompassing, Framework Programme.",

A previous paragraph explained the reason why much of the EC funded research in biology until the late seventies came under the EURATOM flag and, mainly, as a part of the Radiation Protection programme. Now this programme was financially supporting, around the time that a future BEP was being developed, several pan-European working groups of biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, active in the elucidation of DNA damage and repair mechanisms. This was the time when numerous DNA enzymes (DNA polymerases, DNA glycosylases, DNA ligases) were isolated and characterised from several living organisms, with a view to completing the picture of DNA metabolism under different physiological or stressed conditions. Whereas virologists and microbiologists worldwide were effectively at the front line of the discoveries from which recombinant DNA technology could lend itself to revisiting basic biological mechanisms, no doubt that the intellectual climate of prokaryotic/eukaryotic enzymologists and radiobiologists surrounding EC offices gave, as BEP was still in its drafting phase, a somewhat peculiar inclination to the early design of the envisioned European cooperation. In other words, if BEP can now be designated as being the cradle of a whole lineage of EC biotechnology programmes, the Radiation Protection Programme in those days could well be considered the cradle of BEP.

This gives us the opportunity to introduce the \u2018Programme Committee\u2019 composed of national delegations, and established by Council to oversee the EC programme management. Under the BEP programme, the Programme Committee was in the form of an \u2018Advisory Committee for Programme Management\u2019 (ACPM), before it became later a \u2018Committee of an Advisory Nature\u2019 (CAN) as called for under the subsequent Biotechnology Action Programme (BAP) (1985\u20131990) and BRIDGE programme (1990\u20131993). With forthcoming programmes and increased budget however, the Council would require that the Programme Committee be upgraded into a \u2018Regulatory Committee\u2019, thus no longer confined to giving an advice but taking part in the statutory decision making process by means of positive or negative opinions adopted by qualified majority. This became a shift in governance, the consequences of which, amplified by the gradual increase of the number of participating countries, have not been commented on enough. With the ACPM under the BEP, and nine Member States to deal with at the start and 12 at the end of the BEP, following first the accession of Greece and then of Portugal and Spain a few years later, the national delegations still recruited their members among top scientists familiar with science policy-making in their own countries. The tendency afterwards has been to configure these delegations with ministerial officials supported by representatives of science funding organisations, or more recently from Ministries of Industry or Economic Affairs. With regard to the Advisory Committees of the early days, whose composition included some splendid characters, the pursuit of superior aims and the gradual building of common intelligence were typically the most immediate triggers of delegates, whose curiosity and personal judgement had often taken the place of an official mandate. This expert profile, representing a \u2018nascent state\u2019, which probably now belongs to the past, is exemplified below under real conditions (Box 1, Box 2\n).Box 1Juste retour (recovery) and juste d\u00e9tour (diversion)Andr\u00e9 Berkaloff was a member of the French delegation in the BEP-ACPM. He was a university professor (Paris-Orsay), author of a famous handbook on cellular biology & physiology used as a guide by a generation of students, president for a time of the scientific council of the INRA (French agricultural research institute). The event which made him famous in the context EC biotechnology had never been witnessed before. The EC Commission presented to the ACPM the shortlist of project proposals considered after evaluations as being eligible for funding. The committee was invited to provide its advice as usual. One has to remember that proposals did not need to include participants from different Member States (the transnationality criterion was only introduced within the rules as from 1985). Berkaloff's attention was called by two proposals having to do with the molecular genetics of a pathogenic Gram positive bacterium infecting horticultural plants and referred to as Erwinia. The long term interest of these proposals was evident, having in mind that Erwinia operates a well described secretion apparatus, synthesises cellulases and pectinases of potential interest for industry, and had been already partly exploited for an asparaginase tested in cancer therapy, without even mentioning the demand of efficient strategies of disease control under agricultural conditions. Yet, 3 French laboratories (led by Kotoujansky, Robert-Baudouy and Chambost) managed to get a high mark which promoted them in a good position of the shortlist, while the Belgian laboratory with the best expertise in molecular biology (led by Toussaint) fell just below the cut-off point. The advice of the ACPM, as expected, had been for the Commission to find an amount of money just sufficient to rescue the Belgian proposal, and encourage thereafter all contributors to develop some form of cooperation. Regrettably, there was no money left and the Commission confessed being practically unable to follow the advice. This was the time when Berkaloff stood up and argued that the benefit to European science and ultimately to the contributors themselves would be greater if these all got a reduced amount of money and still could join forces. To the general astonishment, he suggested to remove a reasonable amount from the funds attributed to the French part (his own country) and let the Belgian part go in, thanks to this money transfer. Very politically incorrect from the \u2018juste retour\u2019 (recovery) point of view, no doubt, but a wonderful coup of strategic inspiration from the \u2018juste d\u00e9tour\u2019 (diversion) point of view!Box 2Magni's principleAnother character worth giving credit to could easily be Giovanni Magni, member of the Italian delegation under BAP/BRIDGE. He was another university professor (Pavia-Milano) having gained his reputation in yeast genetic research. Like Berkaloff his predecessor, he also was able to stand up and provide sudden enlightenment. Here, we touch upon the very sensitive issue of prioritisation. The instrument of prioritisation in the EC Biotechnology programmes, like in any other EC programme, has been the yearly workprogramme listing specific objectives and tasks for the period, as well as corresponding funding modalities and budgetary breakdowns. Unwillingly, an indirect effect of the restoration of the regulatory nature of committees in 1992 with BIOTECH I and BIOTECH II programmes, along with the higher number of participating countries, had proved to render difficult any exercise aiming at recognising harsh priorities, whatever the strategic reasoning could be to underpin such choices. Although still in an advisory capacity in the late eighties, the Committee Magni belonged to was already revealing the temptations of national delegations to include most of their pet subjects suggested all over the board, with representatives supporting each other until they got satisfaction. The Commission encountered real difficulties to maintain a clear managerial drive, and to ensure that any yearly workprogramme would contain just the set of priorities that would enable the programme to make visible difference under the time limitations. Here came Magni with a brilliant proposal to his fellow members. \u2018Let's make commitment that any delegation decided to push for an additional priority would only be listened to by this Committee if the same delegation was able to indicate which other priority could be removed in compensation, ensuring that such removal could still be supported by a majority of the members\u2019. The initiative was so successful that the Commission continued to refer to it many years after the event, and gave it the unforgettable name of \u2018Magni's principle\u2019.",

            "text": "The Parliament probably achieved more in the field of biotechnology in its struggle with Council to introduce more democracy into decision making than in any other area. Among others the areas of safety assessments associated with GMOs (genetically modified organisms), microbial ecology, in vitro pharmaco-toxicology testing and \u2013 as cross-cutting issues \u2013 the promotion of the participation of SMEs (small and medium size enterprises) and the definition of an ethical approach to funding research, can be highlighted. The resulting impact has certainly been more perceptible towards the end of the sequence of programmes, during the nineties, and can be briefly summarised in the following terms:\u2022Safety assessments associated with GMOsSince GMOs came onto the agenda, two different and complementary areas have received consideration: one to produce GMOs offering definite advantages while the other to control GMOs both in confinement and in the field. It is quite remarkable that, from the BAP to BIOTECH II, the level of funding which has gone into biosafety issues had been continually increasing in both relative and absolute terms, to the point that the EC has ended-up providing as much support to control methods as it does to production strategies. The credit for this can be laid squarely at the Parliament in its role of promoter of the precautionary principle.\u2022Microbial molecular ecologyIt is by now well recognised that molecular microbiology, as part of the renewed biotechnological approaches to soil ecology, is radically changing our understanding of the invisible microbiota thriving below ground level, a unique reservoir of biodiversity. Traditional knowledge areas such as cell-to-cell communication, chemotactism, antibiotics, plasmid instability, virulence, symbiosis, horizontal gene transfer, the species barrier, and many others have to be seen under completely new light since biotechnology started to pervade the field. This conceptual enrichment from soils viewed as substrates to soils viewed as fermenters and, one step further, to soils as microcosms of an on-going accelerated co-evolution of species, could not have been achieved without the advent of microbial molecular ecology as a new scientific discipline [27], [28]. And such a discipline clearly penetrates academic environments with exceptional encouragement through (among other factors) the external pressure exercised by the European Parliament to monitor and strictly control field releases of GMOs. EC biotechnology programmes were in the right place and at the right moment to host these beneficial developments.\u2022\nIn vitro pharmaco-toxicology testingBehind testing methods lies the thorny issue of animal experimentation. The European Parliament proved to be, and still is, quite vocal to reflect the widely diverse citizens\u2019 concerns for animal rights. It largely disseminated the \u20183Rs\u2019 principle (Reduction-Refinement-Replacement) applicable to animal experiments for medical or scientific purposes. Hence, the high expectations placed on the potential of biotechnology as a means to realise the 3Rs, and the ambition of the Parliament to reinforce a research sector on \u2018in vitro testing\u2019. Such in vitro tests need developing to a stage where they can realistically fulfil the objective of bringing the number of animals subject to experimentation to a reasonably low-level throughout the EU.\u2022Research respectful of, and beneficial to, vulnerable groupsThe Parliament rightly expresses its democratic prerogatives when it shows interest in aligning wherever possible EC research investments with the enhancement of vulnerable members of society. The dynamic of technological progress capable of taking the needs of vulnerable people on-board necessarily has to cut across a variety of topics. Such an ambition would best be realised through cross-cutting measures, which the Parliament has been increasingly promoting in biotechnology programmes. Privileged areas under focus have been the ethical overview, and targeted policies for the vulnerable groups such as foetus, children, pregnant women, among others.On the defensive side, ethical principles and practices have received increasing attention, until the European Commission decided to standardise and streamline a mechanism of ethical evaluation initially developed for biomedical research and biotechnology. Needless to say, the biotechnology programmes have come under special ethical focus given the topical nature of experiments involving, for example, non-human primates, human embryonic stem cells, human donors or patients in clinical trials. Thus biotechnology programmes became the place for most refinement since the time of BIOTECH II. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the overall level of ethical consciousness and best practice has been raised steadily over the period and throughout all participating organisations in the life sciences community.On the more offensive side, the Parliament has actively participated in the inter-institutional debate modifying programme proposals and has maintained leading positions in particular when the representation of SMEs, or of women in science has been at stake.\u2022Management and participation in crisis preventionOne example demonstrating that research is anything but a linear exercise comes from the Commission's active involvement in crises in which biotechnology has played a role, either in crisis management, or as part of the solution. During the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, several health crises have seriously affected Europe, and continue to do so. Some of these crises have threatened Europe in a dramatic way, such as the foot and mouth disease epidemic of 2001. Particularly traumatic for public opinion has been the regrettably famous BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) debacle, commonly known as \u2018mad cow disease\u2019 and the TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), more generally referred to as prion diseases. Other crises have had a more global nature such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which is a viral respiratory disease in humans caused by a coronavirus, or avian influenza informally known as avian flu or bird flu, whose major threat was that a mutation of the H5N1 virus might make it transmissible to humans and thus trigger a pandemic.In all of these cases, the Commission rapidly engaged with other international organisations active in the area, in particular the WHO and national health authorities, to address these crises in an as coordinated and effective way as possible. The Council and the European Parliament strongly encouraged and supported the Commission in implementing initiatives to manage, control and fight these crises. Their engagement was translated into extraordinary short times for discussing and approving the Commission proposals. Thus, several calls for research proposals on each of these diseases were launched in record times, never repeated since. Bruno Hansen, at that time Director of Life Sciences and Technologies at the Commission, showed his true leadership during these difficult periods bringing together outstanding scientific officers, such as the late Isabel M\u00ednguez Tudela, making sure that the Commission, with the full backing of the other major EU institutions, prepared, developed and implemented research initiatives aimed at mitigating and fighting the effect of these epidemic diseases.",

They found themselves, however, surrounded by policy orientations not entirely deprived from ambiguities. The Treaty's wording (competitiveness of European industry and support to Community policies) was rather vague and was open to different interpretations, particularly when translated into operational instruments [29]. Commissioners in charge have logically been using this vagueness to support directions which, in their opinion and against the background of their own experience, seemed to respond to widespread sensitivities within their own remit. At the expense of oversimplifying, one might postulate that two main attitudes animated the research Commissioners during their mandates of generally five years. While some were seen as active supporters of an industrial policy, others, perhaps more conservative but willing to understand the functioning of the research fabric in Europe, paid more attention to the modernisation of the educational, legal, international context within which front-line research was expected to blossom.",

These Task Forces were trying to apply, on a macro-economic scale, a concept analagous to that contained in EC biotechnology programmes of the pioneering times. In other words, instead of just mirroring a single EC multi-partner project in an industrial context, the ambition of Research-Industry Task Forces was to mirror an entire research field, selected on the basis of promising technology breakthroughs, within a constellation of dedicated European industries. As the name suggests, task forces were not confined to a single section of the Framework Programme, but readily encompassed connected themes or areas, and went as far as identifying new priorities and examining regulatory implications. The best example here would be the creation of the task force on Vaccines and Viral Diseases which was largely fed by a sector under BIOTECH II addressing trans-disease vaccinology. The idea was not just to bring EC biotechnology research closer to industry, but to give industry a platform from which industrial strategies could somehow reorient EC funded research towards competitive advances. Strikingly, this idea has been taken up, though refined, almost twenty years later, in the Biotechnology Key Enabling Technology part of the Horizon 2020 proposal, with the aim to \u201cDevelop innovative and competitive platform technologies that would trigger leadership and competitive advantage on a number of economic sectors\u201d.

The ERA's fathers have been mainly Commissioners Ruberti (1993\u201394) and Busquin (1999\u20132004). Their vision will prove extremely profitable to biotechnology, in so far as integrating a wide spectrum of structural factors, though external to research in the narrow sense, which are crucial for developing a conducive environment and for ensuring societal take-up and benefit. Among these factors we find the access to complex infrastructures for research, the training and mobility of the research personnel, an opening of EC research to the world, the protection of biotechnology inventions, and a sound scientific support to regulatory measures.",

Commissioners, inspired in one way or another, appeared in an intercalated way thus inviting the following reflection. The pioneering times (BEP-BAP-BRIDGE) were those of intellectual and managerial creativity on a small scale, encouraged by Member States who took deliberate advantage of using the EC open playground as a kind of neutral test bench for cutting edge managerial experiences in research. The later restoration of a stronger policy drive (starting with BIOTECH 1) paired with greater accountability under the mandates of dedicated Commissioners, made a paradoxical evolution possible: continuity as a leading priority, but discontinuity in design and approaches. As far as life sciences are concerned, the continuous and welcome growth of biotechnology budgets, for a period at least, was overlaid by variable underpinning visions. While the old days had seen a management which tested their concepts at project level under the scrutiny of committees, the maturation period more recently was one of concept validation at entire programme level under the scrutiny of national governments through the leadership of Commissioners in charge. Typically, the European Framework programmes between FP2 and FP6 were periodically affected in both substance and procedures, depending on whether the political forces at that particular moment welcomed an objective-driven design or an instrument-driven design. The ever returning question preceding the renewal of entire programmes seems to have been that of the desired hierarchy of values: Will strategic objectives define implementation means, or vice versa? The former implies at programme level sufficient pooling of shared scientific intelligence on the side of EU decision-makers, the latter definitely not to the same extent. The issue of political consensus-building remained at the deep core of this high level challenge.",

Conversely, those coming with broader societal views tended to understand the same criterion as a requirement to secure links with industry in whatever way, not excluding that industry could step in later as a use of the research.

The timeliness of biotechnology provides part of the answer, but the acquired familiarity of previous biotechnology programme users with the dynamics of EC project design and partner integration in transnational consortia must have been key to their reiterated leading positions through this new up-scaling process. Programmes of the first generation must have acted somehow as springboards for those willing to revisit knowledge areas.",

The idea that entire programmes could, on a case-by-case basis, benefit from various forms of decentralisation, externalisation, managerial or financial partnerships, had been on the discussion table of the European Commission for a while. Biotechnology was not escaping the organisational transition of this type, using since Framework 5 national funding in conjunction with EC funding to support EU research. This was made possible through the ERA-NET scheme, based on variable configurations of Member States\u2019 programmes coming to agreement, with the view to addressing specific topics or national programmes in a coordinated way. Here again, the representation of biotechnology research resulted being exceptionally high by comparison with other fields. An outline of ERA-NETs in biotechnology and related areas is available from Aguilar et al. [32]. Even more radically, one is now looking for forms of public-public partnerships, or public-private partnerships, whose first examples have come into existence under FP7 and have much to owe to the convergence of advanced technologies, biotechnology heavily included in several among the known prototypes.",

Supported projects tended to be transnational, by convenience or necessity, even though transnationality did not become an eligibility criterion in its own right until 1985. The joining of forces by participants from different Member States and internal coordination are the most innovative and important factors differentiating research supported by the EU from that supported by other agencies or by the Member States. By rendering this condition compulsory, subsequent programmes made possible not only the mere working together but also to the planning among potential participants of their scientific future together. Transnational scientific and technological cooperation is widely considered by scientific and industrial communities and by European and international funding bodies to make a very positive contribution to maximising the socio-economic impact of research [33]. To this end, the early biotechnology programmes developed a networking approach, called European Laboratories Without Walls (ELWWS), which linked together individual researchers from different laboratories and different countries to carry out multidisciplinary precompetitive research projects. The ELWW approach emphasised a free and rapid flow of information and material between participants, and incorporated joint planning and evaluation of experiments. [34], [35].",

The Industry Platform concept, created and tested under BAP as a counterpart to the European Laboratories Without Walls, should not be confused with the much larger European Technology Platforms for industry, which gained popularity throughout the Framework Programme only from the late 1990s. The Biotechnology Industrial Platforms were open groupings of technology-based industries established around significant multi-partner biotechnology projects which reinforced contacts and interactions between industry and academia and which encouraged further participation by industry in the programme. The first industry platform came into existence in 1987, largely as a result of the personal energy of three leaders of industrial research, Gunary (Nickerson, UK), Veldhuyzen van Zanten (Zaadunie, NL) and Le Buanec (Limagrain, FR). The interest of these industrial representatives in the Platforms is encapsulated in their own statement at the Louvain-la-Neuve BAP conference: \u201cOur experience normally goes through exclusive bilateral links, each with a single university laboratory. We fail to develop links with complex and yet intellectually productive consortia as exemplified through such ELWWs\u201d.

Most of these initiatives lacked coordination with each other and quite often lacked any specific targets or deliverables beyond publication of results in international journals. Europe, at least some countries, was very strong in basic science, indeed the foundations of science in general and of biotechnology in particular can largely be credited to European research; however, contrary to the USA, Europe failed to turn these fundamental discoveries into practical applications in terms of new products or processes. The industrial revolution took place in Europe, but the promises of Biotechnology and of its spin-offs were gradually moving away from our European horizons to the USA and some emerging economies. European leaders realised that Europe was facing a maybe unique chance to support its science base and to develop the potential represented by its translation into socio-economic benefits, and were rightly proud of the Framework Programme as an instrument to do this. The Single European Act (1987) was the first major revision of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. The Act set the European Community the objective of establishing a Single Market by the end of 1992 and laid down the basis of a true science policy for Europe by establishing the aim of strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry and to encouraging it to become more competitive at the international level [12]. The Act encouraged cooperation between undertakings, including small and medium-size undertakings, research centres and universities in their research and technological development activities. It also inserted into the Treaties the mandate to carry out four activities that have constituted since then the backbone of European science policy:(a)Implementation of research, technological development and demonstration programmes, by promoting co-operation with undertakings, research centres and universities;(b)Promotion of co-operation in the field of Community research, technological development and demonstration with third countries and international organisations;(c)Dissemination and optimisation of the results of activities in community research, technological development and demonstration; and, (d) Stimulation of the training and mobility of researches in the Community.\n",

Enters at this point the outstanding figure of Professor Paolo Fasella, director general for research from 1981 until his retirement in 1995 and probably the first high-calibre scientist to become a director general at the European Commission. A distinguished biochemist, he had been for some time a prominent research leader at the University in Rome and, notably became included in the network of contractors supported by the EC Radiation Protection Programme. His widely recognised leadership supported his vision of fabulous prospects for European collaborations as well as the need for a global science policy and its public support to develop with the external view provided by the European Commission. He enjoyed a close relationship with the key actors in most of the different circles in which the new ideas were fermenting and circulated some of the ambitious thoughts then associated with the known EC pioneers (de Nettancourt et al., see above). It was no surprise, then, that he became one of the main architects and promoters of European policies and programmes of research and technological development as he took over the highest responsibilities in the EC research directorate general. It was during these years that the idea of increased European co-operation in science and technology gained substantial ground and led to European Research Framework Programmes becoming one of the main platforms for European co-operative efforts [38]. It was a fortuitous coincidence at this time that led to the fast development of a European biotechnology programme which this article is trying to portray, namely, the stochastic alignment of a commissioner (E. Davignon) who envisioned the policy instrument, a director general (P. Fasella) who had the determination to design and to push through the timely decisions, and those three brilliant experts (D. de Nettancourt, A. Goffeau, F. van Hoeck) with their links to the scientific community who provided the direction and detailed justification for the mobilisation of efforts. And it is to Fasella's credit that his office played the role, throughout his 14 year mandate, of an incubator in which scientific elites and his own collaborators could spend unlimited hours brain-storming and reflecting on future possibilities for European research.",

There was a double rationale to this large-scale networking of European sequencing laboratories, voiced by Goffeau, who had been mobilising the relevant institutions tirelessly. The first was to deliver the first eukaryotic chromosome sequence ever completed, and the second was to involve throughout the data accumulation period the best functional biologists who undertook functional studies of the unravelled genes. he other yeast chromosomes were later sequenced in further European efforts [41]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s further sequencing projects were initiated by European biotechnology initiatives [42], namely, the industrial microorganism Bacillus subtilis and the model plant Arabidopsis, which latter turned out to be much more than an endeavour to decipher an entire plant genome. Indeed, in this case, the EC programme was catalytic as a forum, bringing together numerous plant scientists, each attached to their own pet species until they realised that plant sciences badly missed the equivalent of an \u2018Escherichia coli\u2019 model to consolidate the knowledge base and use it across the fabulous diversity of the whole plant kingdom [43].",

The first, in 2001 [54], included the results of 81 transnational projects mobilising over 400 laboratories and the second [55] presents further results of 50 projects involving more than 400 groups. Overall, since 1982, the EU has invested more than \u20ac300 million in research on GMO safety through its different Framework Programmes. The main conclusion of these efforts is that GM plants and their products are not per se more risky than those produced by conventional plant breeding techniques [53]. The main objectives in developing the programmes on GMO safety were to respond with scientific evidence to legitimate public concerns and to the need to provide policy-makers with sound science on which to base their decisions. While a wide range of views are held on this subject, provision of reliable scientific evidence will contribute to constructive and rational debate in our societies.",

The KBBE does not take a priori any position on the kind of research to be performed, as long as it is geared to develop the bioeconomy; it may be basic or applied, consist of pilot or demonstration activities, or be combination of these. This new approach was initiated in the Seventh Framework Programme (2007\u20132013) and will develop further in Horizon 2020 (2014\u20132020).",

The programme has also supported emerging trends in biotechnology, such as bioinformatics, synthetic biology and nanobiotechnologies, ensuring that Europe is at the forefront of biotechnology developments. The director at that time, Christian Patermann, has been the champion for the KBBE within Europe and beyond, preparing the ground for the Bioeconomy Communication (see below) a few years later.

The originality of EU research and the features differentiating it from the research funded by the Member States is that the EU has supported activities of a complexity or scale that no single Member State could support alone. Biotechnology is intrinsically a transversal activity demanding a multidisciplinary and a multi sectorial approach. The different instruments and initiatives developed over the years with the aim of maximising the impact of the EU research efforts have changed irreversibly the European landscape of science policy and management. This would not have been possible without the regular interactions with the Member States\u2019 delegates in the programme committees, who have provided advice and guidance but who, in turn, have probably received a positive influence from continuing evaluations and deliberations with fellow members of the neighbouring countries, under the strategic approach and working practices of the European Commission services.",

Few scientific and technological fields have such a potential for application in industry, medicine or other societal activities. It is, therefore, not surprising that biotechnology had been so closely scrutinised by stakeholders, such as NGOs, ethicists and policy makers. The fortunes of EU biotechnology has fluctuated between periods favouring industry involvement in research and periods when the drive was to create a science base on which industry could develop its own technology and products. These two policy lines have converged in the Seventh Framework programme with the introduction of a mission-oriented approach for research and demonstration projects. This synthesis will be even more fully deployed in Horizon 2020 with the implementation of the Bioeconomy strategy with its coherent policy framework, to support the translation of research and innovation into industrial applications, and, just as significantly, a better engagement of the Bioeconomy into society.",

Dreux impressed his fellow co-workers and interlocutors through his attention to different views and an exceptional listening capacity.
