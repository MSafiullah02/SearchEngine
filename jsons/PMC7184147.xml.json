Notwithstanding the paucity of any evidence pertaining to older doctors specifically in this or any other epidemic, adverse psychosocial effects on all health care workers are undisputed (Lai et al., 2020; Nickell et al., 2004). A cross-sectional survey of 1257 health care workers (39.2% physicians) from 34 hospitals in China from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, found that more than 70% respondents reported psychological distress and a significant proportion experienced depression (50.4%), anxiety (44.6%), and insomnia (34.0%) (Lai et al., 2020). Notwithstanding the fact that fewer than 20% of this sample were aged over 40, the study demonstrates the impact of frontline positions which were associated with more distress and psychiatric symptoms than second-line positions. As with studies from other epidemics such as the SARS outbreak of 2003, risk factors for distress include being a nurse or female (Nickell et al., 2004), although it is likely that such results were confounded by reporting variables with nurses and females more likely to admit distress. This is an important issue for doctors unaccustomed to their lack of omnipotence when it comes to mental health (Henderson et al., 2012), potentially an obstacle for doctors resisting the urge to retire from or return to the workforce.",

While it is true that many older clinicians have knowledge, skills, resilience, and wisdom equitable with, and in many cases greater than, younger colleagues, it is equally true that aging is associated with changes in physical and cognitive functioning that affect skills germane to clinical work (Eva, 2002). Increased time since graduation has been correlated with decrements in elements of clinical performance including history taking, physical examination, record keeping, problem solving, and mortality with some complex surgical procedures (Ellison, 2019).",

We outline ways this might be achieved, building on the strengths, wisdom, and statesmanship of late-career clinicians while minimizing their risk and exposure:1.Health care institutions should be mindful of the multiple ethical issues at stake including protection of public from harm and duty of care to patients, not holding doctors hostage to their professional duties and the value of reciprocity enacted by protecting and supporting late-career practitioners (Singer et al., 2003);2.Deployment of returning doctors should be focused on non-frontline roles in order to free up other staff with the necessary competencies to take on frontline roles (American Medical Association, 2020);3.Roles including leadership, supervision, consultation, public relations, mentorship, teaching, and research may be particularly appropriate;4.Roles that involve working remotely (e.g. telephone triage and/or assessment of symptomatic patients) and specialties geared to tele-health provision (e.g. psychiatry) might be better suited for safe deployment of the late-career and returning doctor;5.Competencies of late-career and returning psychiatrists should be harnessed to support the health and well-being of the existing workforce;6.Concerns regarding competency might be addressed by using the model adopted by some US states of retired professionals working with an actively licensed supervising professional;7.Physicians should seek insurance coverage for their return to practice activities; and8.In the absence of the profession offering guidelines for service termination for returning physicians in the middle of the pandemic, we suggest that physicians take responsibility for their own welfare. Physicians need to decide for themselves where they draw the line (Klitzman, 2008) and have an exit strategy in place should they decide to return to practice. We would encourage physicians, not only to listen to their inner voice but also the voices of those around them \u2013 whether they be colleagues or loved ones \u2013 who might be expressing their own concerns for the welfare of the physician.\n",

Anecdotal experience of working with recently retired doctors in the UK\u2019s NHS supporting young clinicians undertake complex quality improvement and system change projects has demonstrated real learning (Personal Communication: Kitsell). With a minimum of training in improvement science, they realised that not only were their previous skills very relevant but also recognised the value that this knowledge could have brought to their own working lives. The transfer of this learning, enthusiasm, and recognition of a new skill from an older generation has enabled younger clinicians to step-up and participate in system improvement and change management at an earlier stage of their traditional careers \u2013 a remarkable legacy both to individuals and the communities which they serve. We should not lose this opportunity to explore the value that the older medical workforce can bring to individuals and systems which goes far beyond asking older doctors to return to frontline clinical practice.",
