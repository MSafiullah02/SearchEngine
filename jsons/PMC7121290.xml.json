            "text": "Children are often admitted with a differential diagnosis of a possible viral-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection. Viruses affect the CNS in many different ways and clinical manifestations may overlap, resulting in a spectrum of syndromes. Sejvar (2014) eloquently summarizes the different alternatives of the viral-mediated disease in the CNS responsible for these syndromes [1]. In the more acute phase patients may present with meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis or combinations if multiple regions are affected e.g. meningoencpehalitis or encephalomyelitis [1\u20133]. If vasculitis is a prominent component in a specific disease process, patients may present with more focal signs due to areas of infarcts [1]. In the long term, reactivation of a dormant infection with episodic recurrence will be observed, or a relentless chronic neurodegenerative process may occur and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) or \u201cslow viruses\u201d [1]. Congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or rubella, may result in neurodevelopmental disorders with a more chronic nature [1]. The CNS may also be affected secondarily by a viral-induced immune-mediated attack on the CNS, or indirectly, as seen in liver failure-associated encephalopathy due to viral hepatitis or Reye\u2019s syndrome, which is precipitated by salicylate treatment in children with influenza or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [1].",

            "text": "In practice the definition of encephalitis depends on the presence of clinical signs due to the involvement of the brain tissue itself manifesting as encephalopathy for a period of at least 24 hours and/or specific neurological features with evidence of inflammation [4, 5, 7\u20139]. The indicators of inflammation are fever, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroimaging findings consistent with encephalitis [4]. One of the most useful ways to think of infection is \u201cfever for infection\u201d. The clinical signs of encephalitis are usually non specific but not subtle. However, in immune suppressed patients they may be subtle and often also chronic. The encephalopathy is not due to other metabolic causes, toxins, other neurological disorders or systemic infections [5]. It can be caused by a wide variety of etiological factors including viruses, bacteria, parasites, atypical bacteria or immune-mediated processes [5], but the specific etiology is only confirmed in 60% of cases [8]. The disease course can be acute, sub-acute or chronic, and it is determined by the immune status of the patient [10]. Viruses responsible for sub-acute or chronic presentations in immunocompromised patients are measles virus causing inclusion body encephalitis, VZV causing multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, human herpes virus (HHV) type 6, enteroviruses, John Cunningham virus and BK virus causing progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In immune competent patients John Cunningham virus and BK virus can also cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, whereas measles virus causes SSPE [10].",

HTLV-I causes tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and although these usually present later in life, around the fourth and fifth decades, they have been observed in younger patients [1]. The onset of disease is slow but progressive, and associated with backache and typical sparing of the arms [1]. The legs are affected and the clinical signs are stiffness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, dysesthesia and a positive Babinski sign [1]. The posterior columns are often involved with a loss of position and vibration sense [1]. A similar presentation has been observed by a number of South African clinicians (unpublished data), who have seen children with HIV-1 infection present with spastic diplegia and no bowel or bladder involvement. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings for the brain and spinal cord are normal. It is unclear whether this may perhaps overlap with HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy, as these patients also present with spastic paraparesis and weakness exceeding the degree of spasticity, with hyperreflexia, positive Babinski signs, ataxic gait and dysmetria, and both bowel and bladder incontinence are present [12]. The position and vibration senses are also affected [12]. The macroscopic examination of the spinal cord and dura mater is normal but there is loss of myelin in the lateral and posterior columns, with spongy degeneration or microvacuolization of the white matter [12].",

The CSF reveals a mild pleocytosis, normal glucose and mildly elevated protein [16]. MRI is useful, and specific findings have been related to various antibodies [17]. The MRI in anti-NMDAR encephalitis can be normal in 60% of cases, and the rest may have non-specific findings, best seen on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images demonstrating cortical and subcortical changes in the brain and posterior fossa. Transient meningeal enhancement or demyelination have also been observed [16]. The MRI in rabies, by contrast, may show changes in the basal ganglia, thalamus, gray matter of the dorsal brain stem and central regions of the spinal cord [16]. In limbic encephalitis (usually in elderly patients rather than children), uni- or bilateral involvement in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes has been demonstrated on T2/FLAIR images but the diffusion weighted images are normal and there is no meningeal enhancement [16]. The frontal, occipital and parietal lobes of children, when affected, may have more extensive MRI abnormalities [16].",

It is complex, and influenced by the interplay between the three constituents of the \u201cepidemiologic triad\u201d, namely the host, the agent and the environment [1]. With modernization and constant population growth and increase in population density, not only is the transmission of infectious agents between humans easier, but zoonotic transmission is also favored [1]. Within dense urban communities, with social behaviour that involves increased promiscuity, with easier methods of travel, and with exposure to exotic pets, viruses can spread with great ease. With advances in health care such as the use of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs in transplant patients, opportunistic infections emerge. The food industry has become mass-production orientated, and this favors more food-borne outbreaks. The natural evolution of viruses may increase the virulence of the organisms. Natural disasters and war responsible for the breakdown of infrastructure, as well as deliberate biological warfare, all contribute to the emergence, re-emergence and spread of viruses [1].",

(2016) mention incidence ranges of between 2.8 and 10.5 per 100,000 that have been reported in England, Sweden and the USA [21]. The highest rates have been documented in infants less than 1 year of age. Hospital admissions of children due to encephalitis decreased over a period of 11 years in Australia, but the average hospitalization rate was 5/100,000 [21]. There has been a significant decrease in varicella encephalitis, explained by good varicella vaccine coverage [21].

Swanson and McGavern outline the current understanding of this process clearly [2]. First of all the virus has to enter the host. This can happen through inhalation or ingestion, or through the skin. Viruses such as mumps and measles are spread via droplets, and are inhaled to reach the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The fecal-oral route of ingestion is a way for other viruses, such as enteroviruses, to enter through the alimentary tract. Once at the mucosal membrane, the viruses pass the epithelial barrier and cause infection in the lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx and gut. Insect bites, abrasions and wounds all create a back door through which viruses can enter the body via the skin. Langerhans cells carry arboviruses delivered by insect bites to the adjacent lymph nodes [2].",

HSV-1 and VZV migrate from the keratinocytes to the peripheral sensory neurons to reach the trigeminal ganglion, where they can be latent for years before being reactivated [2]. The dendrites of the olfactory nerve are in direct contact with mucosa in the nose and offer a unique port of entry for HSV-1, Nipah virus, influenza virus and rabies virus [2].

If the primary site is the meninges the number of leukocytes in the CSF is increased, with polymorphonuclear granulocytes the dominant cell type early in the disease, followed later on by monocytes and lymphocytes [4, 10]. In encephalitis the CSF may be normal in up to two thirds of cases [3]. Sejvar et al. define CSF pleocytosis as >15 cells/mm3 in babies less than 2 months of age and >5 cells/mm3 in older infants and children [4].

Despite this a CSF specimen for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and enteroviruses should be sent for PCR for patients with suspected viral CNS infection, as it will identify 90% of known viral causes. A HSV PCR is often negative for the first 3 days after the onset of the disease [32], and then remains positive for the next 7\u201310 days even if acyclovir treatment has been started [10]. The probability of getting a positive PCR is thus reduced if the sample is taken early (that is, within 3 days) or late (after 14 days) in the course of the disease [37]. It may be worthwhile to defer the initial LP for two reasons: if there is a contraindication for the LP due to severe cerebral edema, and to give time for the edema to subside and the PCR to have a better diagnostic yield. There is a correlation between viral replication, degree of clinical severity and the possibility of a positive PCR.",

False positive and negative results are always an issue of concern, and therefore it is important to standardize the molecular diagnostic tests. This is illustrated clearly in a study that examined nine different European reference laboratories and found concordant results in only 28\u201332% of specimens tested for HSV by PCR, whereas real-time PCR has 94% specificity and almost 100% sensitivity [38].",

In the case of Eastern equine encephalitis, serum antibody testing is most helpful, as the disease can be detected within 6 days of onset, and increases fourfold in just 4 days [40].

In response to this problem scientists are investigating different innovative strategies. Most of these are aimed at preventing the virus from completing its life-cycle in the vector, ultimately preventing transmission to humans. These vaccines are called transmission blocking vaccines [58]. One example is dengue virus vaccine. The proteins required in the mosquito for the attachment of the virion to target cells in its midgut, are used in the vaccine as antigens. When a mosquito feeds on a vaccinated human, the antibodies are ingested and subsequently impair the virion attachment in the mosquito, interrupting the completion of its life cycle. This blocks any further transmission by preventing infection of the vector. This type of vaccine is referred to as an \u201caltruistic\u201d vaccine because, while it may not protect the person who has been vaccinated from infection, it prevents the disease from spreading to other members of the community [58]. Significant advances have been made in development of transmission blocking vaccines to control viral vector-borne disease, but further research is still required [58].",

The chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL9 and CCL10 were elevated in the trigeminal ganglia and brain stems of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with HSV-1.

Opercular syndrome, hallmarked by dysarthria, dysphagia and oro-facial palsy, may also manifest [63]. In the California Encephalitis Project, two age groups in which HSE peaks were identified [68]. The first group includes younger children, from 6 months to 4 years, and the second peaked in the age group 10\u201318 years [68]. Lethargy, fever, confusion and seizures are the most common manifestations, but seizures are observed more commonly in the younger age group, and the difference is statistically significant [68]. In contrast to adults, children who develop encephalitis with primary HSV infection may be affected by herpes labialis [10]. Deaths observed in this project were all in children older than 13 years, but this point was not statistically significant [68].",

The CNS is involved in one to three in 10,000 clinical cases, and it manifests as encephalitis, vasculopathy or post-infectious immune-mediated cerebellar ataxia [1, 10]. The latter is often benign and self-limiting, but hydrocephalus may develop if the cerebellum is extensively swollen [10]. Around one third of arterial strokes in children can be associated with VZV; from 1 week up to 48 months after the rash, patients present with acute-onset, but permanent, hemiparesis [10]. Other clinical features include transient facial weakness, chorea, seizures, and visual and speech disturbances [10]. The VZV PCR may be positive in only 30% of cases, but VZV IgG antibodies are positive in as many as 90% of cases. It is recommended that both assays are done [9]. The CSF IgG levels must be compared to serum VZV IgG to confirm intrathecal synthesis [10].",

In addition, the coxsackie virus-B3 infects neural stem cells and thus a viral presence persists [3]. There is a very low yield of positive enterovirus PCR in the CSF, but there is often a higher yield in throat swabs and stool specimens.

Since 1974, enormous emphasis, initiated by the World Health Organization, has been placed on the eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases, including poliomyelitis. Although poliovirus has been controlled to a great extent worldwide, there have been outbreaks reported in Tajikistan, the Republic of the Congo and elsewhere [1]. Two poliovirus vaccines are available, oral (OPV) and intramuscular (IPV). In polio-endemic countries the WHO recommends a birth OPV dose, followed by a primary series of 3 OPV doses and at least one IPV dose. The primary series is administered from the age of 6 week, at 4 week intervals. The clinical presentation is fairly easy to identify, as patients present with typical lower motor neuron symptoms comprising asymmetrical flaccid paralysis, areflexia, fasciculations and wasting, while sensation remains intact and sphincter functions are not usually affected [12]. It is interesting that the weakness seldom progresses after the febrile illness has subsided [12].",

As the incubation period can vary from weeks up to 1 year, with an average of 2 months, it may be difficult to link the disease to a specific contact with either bats or infected animals [75]. The prodromal stage is non-specific, with fever, malaise, headache, nausea with vomiting and the more characteristic feature of paresthesia or pain at the point of entry [80]. The disease course is rapid: more specific symptoms, including hypersalivation, agitation, hydrophobia and significant neck stiffness, develop to be followed by coma and subsequently death within 1\u20132 weeks [80]. The diagnosis relies on serum and CSF serology, but immunohistochemistry on skin may be helpful [80]. Post-exposure management is important and includes wound treatment, vaccination and immunoglobulin [21] as well as prophylaxis of contacts to minimize the risk of secondary transmission [80].

Although the outcome of viral encephalitis varies, the morbidity and mortality are significant. Prompt treatment with antiviral treatment may alter the outcome and is usually started empirically when viral encephalitis is suspected, but it is effective for HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. Aggressive treatment with immune modulating drugs has been successful in autoimmune-mediated encephalitides. The value of routine use of steroids in viral encephalitis is not clear. Prevention is an important aspect of virus management and the drive to develop new vaccines is ongoing and important. A viral etiology should always be considered in a severely ill child with CNS manifestations.",
