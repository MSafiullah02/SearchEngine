The private's fever resolved for several days, and then he had another bout of fever and the aforementioned symptoms. After the second round of fever, he recovered, except for fatigue. Graham remarked: \u201cI have been receiving cases in considerable numbers presenting clinical features which do not differ\u2026 from those given above\u201d.2, 3 Graham was describing what would become known as trench fever. This Historical Review will outline the 3-year quest to identify the epidemiology and cause of trench fever, an infection that would sap the manpower resources of both sides during World War 1. The discoveries of the mode of transmission and causative organism of trench fever represent triumphs of rigorous clinical investigation over the idle speculation that permeated medical discourse at that time. From this springboard, the evolution of our current understanding of trench fever is also described.",

Herringham invited Colonel William Leishman (advisor in pathology to the British Expeditionary Force) to consult on this seemingly new disease. The possibility that these cases were dengue or sandfly fever was entertained, but the new disease did not fit the descriptions of these afflictions.4 The disease took months to be recognised, partly because of the fragmented nature of military medical care.5 In June, 1915, Leishman wrote of the new ailment \u201cI am doubtful whether it deserves serious attention\u201d.1 In a meeting on June 21, with Lieutenant-General Alfred Keogh, Director-General of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), Leishman did not bother to mention the illness.1 Nevertheless, when he returned to France, Leishman promoted further investigations on the disease and, with Herringham, visited several hospitals that had cases. By August, 1915, Leishman shared Herringham's view that this illness was novel.1\n",

Serological tests for typhoid, paratyphoid, and brucellosis were negative. Stool and urine cultures and blood smears were unrevealing. McNee and Renshaw reported that the malady occurred in frontline soldiers and their medical personnel and that the infection could be transmitted by the inoculation of blood from a case of trench fever. Thus, they proposed that the disease was most likely insect-borne, by flies, mosquitoes, midges, or lice.4 At a conference in May, 1916, Leishman presented an overview of trench fever and it was recognised in RAMC documents by August, 1916.1 Nevertheless, scepticism remained. In October, 1916, Sidney Dyke of the RAMC reported seeing 200 patients with fever in a field hospital; he doubted that these cases represented a new entity and ascribed the fevers to \u201cnervous\u201d influenza.12\n",

After excluding those with more than 100 lice, the mean number of lice per man was 20 (range 10\u201330). About 5% of the soldiers were infested with more than 130 lice.13\n",

He proposed the louse as the most likely vector;14 although mosquitos, fleas, and ticks had all been incriminated as vectors of infection before the 20th century, the relation of the body louse to typhus and relapsing fever had only been discovered within the previous decade.15 Wright also thought that rodents could harbour ectoparasites that might serve as vectors of trench fever.14 Arthur Hurst of the RAMC reasoned that because trench fever did not cause diarrhoea or catarrh, it must be insect-borne. Furthermore, he noted that lice were ubiquitous compared with other potential vectors.16 Evidence continued to mount that incriminated the louse\u2014eg, trench fever was more common in units with higher rates of louse infestation.16, 17 In January, 1916, there was an outbreak of pyrexia of unknown origin among Allied troops in Salonika (now Thessaloniki, Greece), which continued into May. Meanwhile, to control louse infestation in Salonika, the barrel disinfector (originally used in Serbia to control typhus in 1915) was implemented and the incidence of pyrexia of unknown origin decreased substantially.18 In July, 1916, Hunt and McNee concluded that lice were responsible, on the basis of exposure histories of personnel at a casualty clearing station who had contracted trench fever.19 Nevertheless, in July, 1916, Herringham remained unconvinced of louse-borne transmission.20, 21 In September, 1916, William Rutherfurd and Basil Hughes of the RAMC blamed those ever-present denizens of the trenches, field voles and rats.22, 23 Later that year, John Muir disputed the term trench fever and the association with lice; he implicated a nasopharyngeal virus.24\n",

Byam noted an association between so-called disordered action of the heart and previous trench fever; he then tried to transmit trench fever to laboratory animals using blood from these patients. Byam's experiments came to the attention of the War Office, and the TFIC was formed.1 The commission was chaired by David Bruce (who had discovered the cause of brucellosis and African trypanosomiasis) and it held its first meeting in November, 1917. Bruce assembled a team of accomplished physicians and scientists that included three fellows of the Royal Society. The goal of the TFIC was \u201cto make a complete investigation of the disease from every point of view\u201d.31 The commission recruited more than 200 men, mostly unfit for military service, who volunteered to do their part for King and country.20, 31 Previously, McNee and Renshaw4 had shown that trench fever was transmissible by blood inoculation, so the investigators started from this point. On Feb 14, 1918, the TFIC announced that the human body louse (figure 2\n) is the vector of trench fever and that the inoculation of infected louse faeces into abraded skin or the conjunctivae is the means of transmission.32 The TFIC also made several salient observations (panel\n).PanelObservations of the War Office Trench Fever Investigation Commission32\n\u2022The human body louse is the vector of trench fever and the inoculation of infected louse faeces into abraded skin or the conjunctivae is the means of transmission\u2022The average incubation period is 7\u00b77 days\u2022The gut contents of one infected louse is sufficient for transmission\u2022The bite does not cause transmission because there is no salivary gland involvement or regurgitation\u2022The causative organism is within the blood plasma\u2022Patients with trench fever are capable of infecting lice for at least 443 days from the onset of illness\u2022Louse faeces are not infective via nasal or oral routes\u2022The faeces become infective 5 days after the louse feeds on a patient with trench fever\u2022The organism is not passed from infected lice to their offspring\u2022Head lice can also transmit the infection\u2022Infected faeces remain infectious for at least 4 months\u2022The infection is likely to be rickettsial31\n\n",

The central dilemma was that soldiers' clothing required frequent disinfestation. In 1915, the usual complement of disinfestation apparatus per division rarely exceeded one Foden Thresh (steam-propelled) disinfector (Figure 3, Figure 4\n) and two horse-drawn threshes. However, three disinfectors for one division were not even adequate to treat all the underwear. In 1915, there was an attempt to disinfest uniforms by ironing, but this was too labour intensive.47 In the absence of adequate resources for louse control, soldiers often resorted to manual disinfestation (figure 5\n).

The organisms, which they named Rickettsia quintana, were similar to those seen in lice infected with R prowasekii. By contrast, R quintana was absent from lice that had fed on healthy controls or patients with other infections. However, Arkwright was unable to grow the organism in culture (as with R prowasekii). Despite Arkwright's evidence, scepticism remained. Percy Bassett-Smith of the Royal Navy stated that a spirochetal cause had not been disproven.33 Previously, at a meeting of the Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1918, Bruce stated that he was unconvinced that bacteria of \u201cthat almost mythical genus Rickettsia\u201d were the cause of trench fever. Also in attendance, Leishman opined that a protozoan was responsible.21 In Strong's assessment, trench fever was caused by a virus.7 With the inability to culture R quintana, controversy regarding the nature of the rickettsial bodies persisted into the 1920s; they were postulated by Swift to be \u201ca granular stage [of] some other micro-organism\u201d or \u201c[a viral] inclusion\u201d.5\n",

Analysis of DNA extracted from dental pulp has provided evidence of B quintana infection in Napoleon's soldiers at a Lithuanian gravesite (dated to 1812) and several French gravesites dating from 300 to 4000 years ago.62\n",

The epidemic of trench fever shows how war can act as a catalyst for the recrudescence of an infectious disease;80 other examples include malaria in World War 1, leishmaniasis during the Sudanese civil war, and epidemic typhus during the Burundian civil war. The story of trench fever also shows the methods used by physicians a century ago to deal with an emerging disease threat and scientific discourse in the early age of medical microbiology.81\n",
