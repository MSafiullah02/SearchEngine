To date, there are over 335 COVID-19-related clinical trials registered on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website (3). The proposed drugs aim to prevent viral entry into host cells, interrupt viral replication, and attenuate virus-induced inflammatory responses. Examples of the drugs being tested for each of these mechanisms are recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (RhACE2), the antiviral remdesivir, and the immunosuppressant, tocilizumab, respectively.",

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are by far the most popular drugs proposed for treatment and prophylaxis, appearing in 97 of the COVID-19 clinical trials registered on the NIH site. These aminoquinolines, which were discovered in 1934 and are inexpensively produced in several countries, and have well-known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The antiviral mechanisms of chloroquine are based on its capacity to increase the endosomal pH. This prevents enveloped viruses, such as those belonging to the Coronaviridae family (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), from entering and releasing their genetic material into the host cells and from replicating their envelopes. Furthermore, in severe and complicated COVID-19 cases, the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may also be of importance, as both medications can suppress the production and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (4).",

Aside from the lack of evidence supporting his proclamations, the president's action hampered the treatment of patients who truly need chloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Pronouncements by the French president also appeared to have pressurized French doctors to prescribe the drug, despite its unconfirmed efficacy and many possible side effects (9) . The same situation occurred in the United States (USA); the country's president has endorsed chloroquine in a highly politicized debate over its use (10) . A serious health system should not encourage protocols based on political beliefs or case reports. Scientific trial phases exist and are in constant review so we can guarantee some basic level of safety regarding prescription medications. Ignoring or skipping these phases can result in manmade medical disasters, such as the thalidomide-induced teratogenesis tragedies in the 20th century, which resulted in more than 10,000 children were born with debilitating malformations, leading to the scientific community being forced to rethink interventional studies and the approval process for new drugs (11) . Drug repositioning is possible and encouraged in case of pandemics, but chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine should not be recommended to the general population as if these medications were supported by grade 1a evidence (12) . Affirmations of the drugs' effectiveness, such as those by some of our world leaders in the middle of the pandemic will only spread fear and the erroneous belief in chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine as a panacea.",
