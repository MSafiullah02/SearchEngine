            "text": "Cell signaling is a part of a complex system of communication through which living cells interact with the neighbouring cells and extracellular environment (Denef, 2008). Cells are equipped with glycoproteins or glycolipid receptors on the plasma membrane through which they respond to changes in their immediate environment. When a complementary ligand (signaling molecule) binds to the receptor, it initiates a chain of events within the cell called signal transduction, ultimately resulting into a response. This ability of the cells to respond to their microenvironment solely determines growth, development, tissue injury/repair, cell homeostasis and immunity. A cell can communicate signals to neighbouring cells in multiple ways, which include: direct transfer of ions/small molecules through pores in the membrane, endocrine signaling that utilizes hormones, paracrine signaling by secreting chemicals into the common intercellular space, autocrine signaling to alter its own extracellular environment, juxtacrine signaling by making physical contact with adjacent cells and synaptic signaling (nervous system) (Brucher and Jamall, 2014).",

Cells employ numerous intracellular signaling pathways for transmitting information within the cell. However, a cross talk among these cell signaling pathways is quite possible (Vert and Chory, 2011). The signaling pathways may be activated in response to external stimuli or via the messengers (ligand/information/metabolic) that are generated within the cell following insults. The information in signaling pathways is conveyed either through protein-protein interactions or via diffusible elements usually referred to as second messengers (Cargnello and Roux, 2011).",

Besides being key regulator of normal cellular processes, RTKs also play a critical role in the development and progression of several types of cancer (Bennasroune et al., 2004). Mutations in RTKs lead to the dysregulation of a series of signaling cascades that may eventually develop disease syndromes. (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010). RTKs are member of the large family of proteins that contain a trans-membrane domain, an extracellular N terminal region, and an intracellular C terminal region. The cytoplasmic C terminal region of RTKs is highly conserved, encompassing kinase activity and catalyses receptor autophosphorylation including tyrosine phosphorylation of RTK substrates (Segaliny et al., 2015). Tyrosine kinase that does not possess any trans-membrane domains also exists and is called as non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Currently, over 20 different RTK classes have been identified viz; epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin receptor family, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), cholecystokinin receptors (CCKR), nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), ephrin receptor, AXL receptors, tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1 (TIE1), related to receptor tyrosine kinase receptor (RYKR), discoidin domain receptor, 1 (DDR1), rearranged during transfection (RET), ROS receptor family, leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase (LTK), receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR), muscle-specific kinase receptors (MuSK), lemur tyrosine kinase (LMR), and an undetermined class of RTKs (Segaliny et al., 2015).",

Binding of SH2 and PTB proteins with auto-phosphorylated intra-cytoplasmic domain of RTK leads to initiation of signal transduction pathways (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010). Besides SH2 and PTB, occasionally, adaptor proteins such as src homology 3 domain containing (SH3) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), which have no intrinsic enzymatic activity, can also initiate MAPK signaling by recruiting son of sevenless (SOS) protein (Gobert Gosse et al., 2005) (Fig. 1).

Ras is a 21-kDa protein belongs to the superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and is structurally related to G\u03b1 subunit of heterotrimeric G protein. In the inactive state, it binds to the nucleotide guanosine diphosphate (GDP) while in the activated state, binds to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Ras interacts with and transmits signals to the downstream effecter molecules (MAPKKKs/MAPKKs) associated with ERK/JNK/p38 pathway (Rajalingam et al., 2007). The process of exchanging the bound nucleotide is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (Li et al., 2016) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Wennerberg et al., 2005).",

Ras-GTP activates rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf) which serves as first part of ERK/MAPK module. Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-GAP) are the family of regulatory proteins that bind to activated G proteins and stimulate their GTPase activity, eventually resulting in termination of the signaling event. By stimulating intrinsic Ras GTPase and consequent hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, Ras-GAP negatively regulates Ras-GTP (Bollag and McCormick, 1991; Trahey et al., 1988). Viral infections induce Ras-GAP cleavage which eventually triggers activation of Ras pathway. For example, Coxsackie virus B 3 (CVB3) infection leads to cleavage of Ras-GAP to produce Ras-GTP (activate state) which is required for efficient virus replication (Huber et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2002). Inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which regulates cleavage of Ras-GAP, results in reduced CVB3 replication (Huber et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2002) (Table 1).",

Autophosphorylation of different intracytosolic domains of RTKs (Margolis and Skolnik, 1994) or conformational changes in GPCRs (Della Rocca et al., 1997) activate Ras by recruiting GEFs. Mutations in Ras may lead to persistent activation of Ras (Chappell et al., 2011; Li et al., 2016). Besides GEFs, some adaptor proteins also support MAPK activation. For example, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), an adaptor protein, recruits SOS and triggers activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. 1). MAPK activation results in transcription of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation (Li et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2002) whereas PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cytoskeleton integrity and apoptosis. Ras has four subtypes viz; Ha-Ras, N-Ras, KiRas 4 A and KiRas 4B of which KiRas strongly activates MAPK pathway (Li et al., 2016; Yan et al., 1998) whereas HaRas more strongly activates PI3K/Akt pathway (Li et al., 2016).",

Among the three types of MAPKs, p42/p44 (ERK) is phosphorylated solely by MEK 1 and 2, p38 MAPK is selectively activated by MKK3 and MKK6, while JNK is activated by MKK7 and MKK4. However, MKK4 may also activate p38 MAPK upon over expression (Maroni et al., 2004). Activated MEK has been shown to positively regulate borna disease virus (BDV) spread to neighbouring cells (Planz et al., 2001), RNA synthesis of the coronavirus (Cai et al., 2007) and nuclear export of influenza viruses (Ludwig et al., 2004; Pleschka et al., 2001).",

In order to initiate ERK signaling, Raf interacts with MEK1/2 which in turns activates ERK. ERK1 and ERK2 are two isoforms with 83% amino acid homology and are expressed in diverse tissue types, which can be activated by a large number of extracellular and intracellular stimuli (Shi et al., 2013). Activated ERK can phosphorylate downstream kinases in the cytoplasm, at cell membrane and in the nucleus, thus diversifying the signaling cascade. ERK1/2 has more than 160 downstream target molecules (Li et al., 2016; McCubrey et al., 2007) that may phosphorylate different transcription factors, such as Ets-1, c-Jun, cMyc, CREB, NF\u03baB, Elk1, c-Fos, c-Jun and STAT1 (Nakano et al., 1998; Shi et al., 2013; Steelman et al., 2004). NF-\u03baB and STAT1 are rapidly activated in response to viral infections and cytokines, thus modulating the expression of genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis and immune response (Kumar et al., 2008; Levy et al., 2011). Some of the downstream targets such as ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family members are solely activated by ERK (Chambard et al., 2007; Roux and Blenis, 2004). RSK is shown to regulate KSHV lytic replication by promoting viral protein translation (Kuang et al., 2011).",

Likewise, overexpression of an active form of the Raf catalytic domain enhances parvovirus (Riolobos et al., 2010) and HIV-1 (Flory et al., 1998) replication. These evidences suggest that enhanced signaling activity may be misused by the viruses for their effective replication. For example, IAV interacts with ERK1/2 that allows effective trafficking of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) (Pleschka et al., 2001), viral genome synthesis (Gaur et al., 2011) and induction of immune response, mediated via RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) (Kujime et al., 2000). Adenovirus type 7 activates Raf/MEK/ERK pathway that results in induction of IL-8 which plays an important role in viral pathogenesis (Alcorn et al., 2001). ERK2 is involved in regulating HIV-1 virion assembly and release by phosphorylating p6Gag (Hemonnot et al., 2004; Snyder et al., 2010). In HCV infection, MAPK/ERK pathway regulates viral RNA translation by directing the viral genome towards IRES (Pei et al., 2012). By regulating expression of lytic gene (switching viral latency from latent to lytic phase), MAPK pathway also facilitates Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) replication (Xie et al., 2008).",

Only replication-competent (but not UV-irradiated/inactivated) viruses are capable of triggering late ERK activation thereby suggesting that high level of late-phase ERK activation is dependent on accumulation of viral gene/gene products; the late phase ERK activation is associated with expression of HCV core protein (Shenoy-Scaria et al., 1992) and the HIV-1 Tat protein (Rusnati et al., 2001).",

JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, while JNK3 is limited to brain, heart and testis (Yan et al., 2010). During JNK activation, initial signaling pathway starts with the activation of several MAPKKKs including TAK1, MEKK1/4, MLK2/3, and ASK1, which phosphorylate MEK4 or MEK7 and thus lead to activation of JNK (Krishna and Narang, 2008) (Fig. 1). JNK induces activation of transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB p65, ELK-1, c-Fos, c-Jun and STAT1 which play a pivotal role in regulating the immune response to viral infections. In addition, activated JNK induces secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (Das and Muniyappa, 2010) such as TNF\u03b1, IFNs, IL1, IL2 and IL6 (Ting et al., 2010). JNK is also associated with regulation of apoptosis via modulation of c-Jun/AP1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) (Xing et al., 2010). Although JNK is important for apoptosis, it also contributes to cell survival. These opposite effects rely on duration and magnitude of the pathway activation as well as concurrent activation of other signaling pathways. Prolonged activation of JNK mediates apoptosis whereas transient activation allows cell survival (Shi et al., 2013). Transient JNK activation is therefore essential for effective virus replication such as HSV-1 (McLean and Bachenheimer, 1999), DENV (Ceballos-Olvera et al., 2010), IAV (Ludwig et al., 2001) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (Rahaus et al., 2004).",

            "text": "MAPK interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) is one of the MAPKs activated kinase encoded by Mnk1 gene (O\u2019Loghlen et al., 2004). It is expressed in all adult tissues except the brain (Waskiewicz et al., 1997) and is mainly activated by ERK1/2, although p38 can also activate it (Hargett et al., 2005; Roth et al., 2017). The downstream enzymatic activity of MNK1 depends on the upstream regulators (ERK1/2 and p38) which phosphorylate it at specific residues; these phophorylation sites have been mapped using phospho peptide analysis of MNK1 by mass spectrometry (Cargnello and Roux, 2011). MNK1 has several potential downstream substrates, which include (i) eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4 G (eIF4 G) that helps in 5\u2032 m7G-dependent mRNA translation and regulate cell growth and proliferation (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005). (ii) heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 1 (hnRNPA1) that facilitates processing, metabolism and transport of pre-mRNA. Besides, it also helps in production of TNF\u03b1 and plays an important role in regulating inflammation (Locksley et al., 2001). (iii) p54 together with PSF [polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB)-associated splicing factor] form transcription splicing factor that is implicated in diverse biological functions such as alternative processing and translation of RNAs, as well as regulation of tissue-specific gene expression (Buxade et al., 2008; Valcarcel and Gebauer, 1997). (iv) Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) leads to production of eicosanoids (a second messenger) and plays an important role in immunity and inflammation (Hefner et al., 2000).

Some of the viruses such as influenza virus steal the 5\u2032 cap from the cellular mRNAs (Gu et al., 2015; Plotch et al., 1981) whereas several other viruses synthesize it by using host-encoded capping apparatus, for instance, vaccinia virus and reoviruses (Harwig et al., 2017). Viruses such as flaviviruses (Saeedi and Geiss, 2013) and nidoviruses synthesise the 5\u2032 cap by their own capping apparatus (Harwig et al., 2017). Caliciviruses and picornaviruses contain VPg at its 5\u2032end (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Goodfellow et al., 2005). These 5\u2032 end structures in viral genome mimic 5\u2032 m7G cap of the host mRNA, therefore viral RNA is translated like cellular mRNA. These viruses do not completely shutoff host protein synthesis. For initiation of 5\u2032 m7G cap-dependent viral mRNA translation, eIF4 F plays a central role in recruiting protein synthesis machinery to fully process capped mRNAs (Fig. 2). eIF4 F consists of a large adaptor protein eIF4 G that binds with eIF4E, a cap-binding protein eIF4 A, an RNA helicase (Svitkin et al., 2005), poly(A)-binding protein (PABA) that links 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of properly spliced mRNA (Imataka et al., 1998) and eIF3 that assembles mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit.",

The mechanism of association of MNK1 with viral IRES-mediated translation is not completely understood. IRES-containing viruses can misuse activated MNK1 only when the classical function of MNK1 is being usurped, i. e. phosphorylation of eIF4E and its binding with eIF4 G to form eIF4 F complex, to initiation translation (Cuesta et al., 2000) (Fig. 2). Activated MNK1 is misused by the viruses by three distinct mechanisms, which include (i) Dephosphorylation of eIF4E as seen in poliovirus and EMCV (Kleijn et al., 1996). (ii) Cleavage of eIF4 G as seen in poliovirus and pestivirus (Kempf and Barton, 2008; Willcocks et al., 2011) and (iii) Inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation as seen among adenoviruses (Gingras and Sonenberg, 1997). These events, which are associated with suppressing classical MNK1 function, trigger a switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation (Gingras and Sonenberg, 1997), eventually preventing translation of celllular but not viral mRNA.",

The larger fragment that contains binding sites for eIF4 A and eIF3 recruits 40 s preinitiation complex (PIC) (required for translation). For example, poliovirus 2 A protease cleaves eIF4 G in order to selectively translate viral mRNA (Kempf and Barton, 2008; Willcocks et al., 2011). (ii) class II IRES induce conformational change in eIF4 G but do not result in its cleavage. The host protein shutoff is achieved by inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation concomitant with recruitment of 40 s PIC, for example adenovirus (Gingras and Sonenberg, 1997) and HIV-1 (Borman et al., 2001). (iii) class III IRES utilize prokaryotic-like mode of translation initiation. By interacting with eIF3 and ribosomes, it facilitates positioning of ribosomes at mRNA (Babaylova et al., 2009; Berry et al., 2010; Locker et al., 2007), for example pestivirus, HCV, HIV-1 (Locker et al., 2011) and simian picornavirus (SPV9) (de Breyne et al., 2008). (iv) class IV IRES directly recruit 40S subunits without utilizing any eIFs, for example members of the family Dicistroviridae (Jan and Sarnow, 2002; Kamoshita et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2000). Trans-acting host factors such as SRPKs, hNRNPA1 and PSF (MNK1 downstream substrates) interact with the CREs (positive-stranded RNA viruses and ds RNA viruses) to regulate viral RNA replication, subgenomic mRNA synthesis, translation and encapsidation.

Ser/Arg (SR)-rich proteins (SRPs) that are prime substrates of SRPK1/2 (Brown et al., 2014b) constitute a large family of nuclear phosphoproteins that found in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Sanford et al., 2004) and are associated with host-RNA-processing and alternative splicing. Upon direct interaction with viral mRNA, SRPs facilitates splicing of viral pre-mRNA in SINV, HIV-1, CMV (Fukuhara et al., 2006) and HCV (Karakama et al., 2010).",

(Hall, 2008). The high ATP/AMP ratio promotes and activates mTORC1, which leads to the dissociation of eIF4E from 4E-BP, ultimately resulting in enhanced protein synthesis (Brett et al., 2014), to support virus replication (Kuss-Duerkop et al., 2017; McNulty et al., 2013; Stohr et al., 2016). Conversely, antiviral role of mTORC1 has been demonstrated in CHIKV where virus has evolved a mechanism to bypass mTORC1 inhibition via MNK1/eIF4E mediated translation (Joubert et al., 2015) (Fig. 2). Antiviral function of mTORC1 in VSV is believed to be due to mTORC1-dependent type I IFN production, and initiation of autophagy (Alain et al., 2010).",

            "text": "mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin and contains mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mammalian target of rapamycin (RICTOR), mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interaction protein 1 (mSIN1), proline-rich protein 5 (PRR5) and mLST8 (Hall, 2008). Energy depletion (low ATP levels) leads to adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated accumulation of AMP, which inhibits mTORC1 and activates mTORC2 (Brett et al., 2014). Upregulation of various apoptotic factors and inflammatory mediators during viral infection leads to cellular stress (reduced ATP level), which results in inactivation of mTORC1 and AMPK-mediated activation of mTORC2. Activated mTORC2 then promotes Akt phosphorylation (Vadlakonda et al., 2013) and MNK1 dephosphorylation. The Akt-mTORC2 signaling plays a critical role in survivalbility of cells under stressful conditions such as: (i) activation of PKC\u03b1 that maintains microtubule integrity (cytoskeletal dynamics) (ii) controlling ion transport and cellular growth via serine/threonine-protein kinase (SGK1) phosphorylation (iii) inhibiting PKR-mediated inflammatory response and upregulation of interferons (iv) interfering caspase protein and p53 mediated apoptosis and (iv) inhibition of MNK1 that shutoff both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation. This global inhibition of cellular protein synthesis aids in immune evasion (Ersahin et al., 2015; Porta et al., 2014). For example, influenza virus (Kuss-Duerkop et al., 2017), vaccinia virus and cowpox virus (Soares et al., 2009) activate mTORC2-Akt signaling which play a critical role in survivalbility at late stage of viral infection. However, in a study, DENV polyprotein was found to suppress only host cell translation at the level of translation initiation whereas viral protein synthesis remained unaffected. DENV infection triggered activation of p38/MNK1signaling that eventually resulted in phosphorylation of eIF4E, which was sufficient to translate viral genome (Roth et al., 2017).",

Many of them directly modulate PKR activity while others inhibit phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. PKR, a member of eIF2\u03b1 family of kinases contributes in cellular homeostasis by inhibiting translation of nonessential proteins. It acts as a pattern recognition receptor to sense dsRNA, a replicative intermediate formed in host cells during RNA virus replication. It has three sensor units viz; (i) general control nonrepressed 2 (GCN2) that is activated in response to amino-acid deprivation (ii) PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) that is activated in response to overloaded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and (iii) heme-regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase (HRI) that is activated in response to reduced heme levels as well as heat shock (Dang Do et al., 2009). Activated PKR phosphorylates \u03b1 subunit of eIF2-\u03b1 as well as activating stress pathways- JNK, p38, NF\u03baB (Fernandes, 2016) and protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2 A) (Ahn et al., 2007).",

Phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 antagonize MNK1 functions by arresting both cellular and viral mRNA translation (Srivastava et al., 1998). For example, PKR mediated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is shown to inhibit translation of VSV (Connor and Lyles, 2005), rotavirus (Rojas et al., 2010) and alphavirus (Ventoso et al., 2006), besides inducing shutoff of the host cell translational machinery. PKR-mediated activation of NF\u03baB (Dabo and Meurs, 2012), JNK and p38 leads to upregulation of various transcription factors including interferons and cytokines, thereby inducing an antiviral state (Taghavi and Samuel, 2012). PKR-mediated activation of tumor suppressor PP2 A leads to negative regulation of ERK1/2 (Yu et al., 2004) and AKT signaling (Ugi et al., 2004). Inhibition of ERK1/2 impedes MNK1 activation (Waskiewicz et al., 1997) whereas AKT inhibition may negatively affect cell survival (lack of maintenance of microtubule integrity and interference with p53 mediated apoptosis) (Ersahin et al., 2015; Porta et al., 2014), thereby preventing further viral spread and augmenting abortive viral replication. Besides PKR, SPRY2 (MNK1 substrate) also triggers interferon production. In addition, SPRY2 negatively regulates ERK-MNK1 signaling (Cabrita and Christofori, 2008). By upregulating TNF\u03b1 (Locksley et al., 2001) and eicosanoids (Hefner et al., 2000), MNK1 substrates- hnRNPA1 and cPLA2 also play an important role in immunity and inflammation.",

Each virus requires over a thousand host proteins to effectively replicate inside the host. Each siRNA screen identified multiple MAPK components that influence virus replication. Nevertheless, genomewide siRNA screens conducted on Zika Virus (ZIKV), DENV (Savidis et al., 2016), HCV (Lupberger et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2009), Ebola Virus (Kolokoltsov et al., 2009) and SARS-CoV (de Wilde et al., 2015) have identified MNK1 as one of the cellular factor that regulates virus replication. MNK1 has been identified as a proviral factor in all the siRNA screens conducted so far. However, MNK2 has both proviral and antiviral (de Wilde et al., 2015) functions, depending on the virus prototypes involved. More detailed functional analyses of these host genes (identified in genome-wide screens) will provide insights for development of novel antiviral therapeutics.",

Their malfunction, hyperactivity or overexpression is usually associated with disease. Kinase is one of the most intensively studied classes of drug targets (Zhang et al., 2009). Understanding the structural basis of kinase is essential for developing selective inhibitors to target most possible member of the kinome (Cao et al., 2010). Over 80 kinase inhibitors have been evaluated to some stage of clinical trial and over 30 distinct kinase inhibitors have been developed to the level of a Phase I clinical trial (Zhang et al., 2009). The vast majority of these inhibitors were investigated for the treatment of cancer (Player, 2009). However, dysregulation of kinase function has been implicated in several other disorders, including metabolic, immunological, neurological and infectious disease. Most of the known kinase inhibitors target at the kinase activation loop in the ATP binding site (Zhang et al., 2009).",

In RTKs, ligand binding induces dimerization and autophosphorylation at its Ser/Thr residues (intracytoplasmic domain). With the help of adaptor proteins- SOS/Grb2, activated RTKs convert Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP. In GPCRs, ligand binding induces structural changes in heterotrimeric subunits. These structural changes trigger generation of secondary messenger, which eventually converts Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP. Upon formation of Ras-GTP, further information in the pathway is conveyed by three sequentially acting evolutionary conserved proteins of MAPK-ERK family namely Raf (MAPKKKs), MEK1/2 (MAPKKs) and ERK1/2 (MAPK). Besides ERK signaling, Ras-GTP also activates those MAPKKKs, which are required for phosphorylation of MEK4/7 and MEK3/6 to trigger JNK and p38 pathway respectively. The ERK1/2 and p38 activation ultimately results in phosphorylation of MNK1. Activated MNK1 regulates functions of several potential downstream substrates. eIF4E and eIF4 G, which help in formation of 5\u2032 cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation complex (eIF4 F). hnRNPA1 helps in pre-mRNA processing. PSF involves in post translational processing as well as translocation of mRNA. cPLA2, which regulates production of eicosanoids, a second messenger, plays an important role in immunity and inflammation. Spry2 is associated with interferon production and negative regulation of ERK/MAPK pathway. Besides, MNK1 also participates in regulation of cap-independent mRNA translation, which involves activation of SRPK, mediated via mTOR. By activating transcriptional factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos STAT1, ATF1/2/6, Elk1, Ets1, p53 and NF-\u03baB, JNK and p38 induce inflammatory response.",

Further information in the pathway is conveyed by phosphorylation (activation) of a series of enzymes, namely Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 which leads to activation of MNK1. Alternatively, MNK1 may be acitivated by p38. Besides regulating cell proliferation, cell survival and immune response, activated MNK1 also regulates viral mRNA translation. Activated MNK1 leads to dissociation of 4EBP1-eIF4E complex, which results in release (mediated via mTORC1) and subsequently phosphorylation of eIF4E. Activated eIF4E is required for assembly of eIF4 F to initiate cap-dependent viral mRNA translation. Alternatively, MNK1 may modulate SRPK function by directly inhibiting mTORC2-Akt signaling which is prerequisite for cell survival during viral infection. Activated SRPK phosphorylates SRPs that bind with IRES in the viral genome to initiate cap-independent viral mRNA translation. Activated MNK1 also facilitates pre-mRNA and post-translational processing, mediated via hnRNPA1 and PSF respectively.",
