While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 36 COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe 37 disease among patients remain poorly understood. 38 39 Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive 40 patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1 st 41 and April 23 rd , 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted 42 anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from 43 electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random 44 forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk 45 assessment, we used data available during patients' initial presentation at the emergency 46 department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of 47 the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) 48 mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in 49 determining these patient trajectories. 50 51 Results Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that 52 required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 53 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical 54 data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-55 ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated 56",

The performance of all three models shows a marked decrease when predicting mortality 352 (Fig. 6) . The logistic regression and XGBoost reach AUCs of 0.66 and 0.74, respectively, only 353 outperformed by random forest reaching an AUC of 0.75. However, model stability is 354 improved with standard deviations across cross-validation folds reaching their lowest levels 355 over all three clinical endpoints (Table 4) protein levels adding a small but significant contribution (Fig. 7A) . Similarly, tree-based 365 methods rely heavily on age for their predictions, with smaller contributions of respiratory rate 366",

            "text": "these results were to be expected. Our findings are supported by similar 396 works, in which age is consistently found to be the most important feature [16-18]. However, 397 we note that other potential indicators for severe viral infection, like increased temperature 398 and markers of immune system activation, e.g. C-reactive protein, are less prominent in our 399 feature importance scores. Overall, prediction of mortality relies more strongly on blood tests 400 as opposed to indicators of oxygen supply observed in other cohorts. The reason for this 401 observation and its clinical significance is, as of yet, unclear. Our ALE analysis reveals that 402 lower patient age contributes to an increased probability of receiving mechanical ventilation 403 and critical care in AICU, while coinciding with lower mortality. We also note that Docherty et 404 al. find that 17% of COVID-19 patients require admission to a High Dependency or Intensive 405 Care Unit [25], which is similar to 15% of patients in our data. 406 Conversely, our findings concerning the importance of features relating to patients' 407 oxygenation status are not corroborated by other works. Specifically, other studies find that 408 one important predictor of patient outcome is the level of lactate dehydrogenase [17,18], 409 which, although present in our data set, does not significantly contribute to predictions. 410 A novel aspect of the present analysis is the use of data limited to a patient's first few hours 411 in ED. While this perhaps more accurately reflects the data available at the time of admission, 412 it may well come at the cost of missing important information, such as medical history or 413 primary care data, for predicting patient outcome. This may explain the comparative difficulty 414 in predicting mortality, since a patient's overall chance of surviving infection may depend 415heavily on their medical history. Also note that, in our analysis, all patients were considered 416 together for mortality prediction and the cohort was not further split according to 417confounding factors such as age or sex. In addition, mortality data for recent hospital 418admissions are by their nature censored, with clinical endpoints for patients who remain in 419hospital not yet fully known. 420While we base our study on a comparatively large data set from two hospitals, longitudinal 421 information from additional treatment centres and geographic regions may improve a model's 422 ability to generalise. We note that such data is currently unavailable for COVID-19. However, 423 future studies may benefit from a multicentre approach. As a result of limited data and the 424 imbalanced cohorts, model stability remains a major challenge. While we use inverse class 425 weights and stratified 3-fold cross validation to mitigate this issue, large uncertainties in 426 model results persist, and many predictions do not reach statistical significance. Increased 427 patient numbers, in particular among target patients, may lead to more conclusive results. 428",
