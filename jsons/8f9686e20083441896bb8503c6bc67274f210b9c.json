See also the book by Reilly [1044] for many other examples.Spurred by this dazzling technology, thousands of researchers worldwide have been, or are now, involved in hundreds of sequencing projects for species like the cellular slime mold, roundworm, zebrafish, cat, rat, pig, cow, and baboon. Limited resources focus efforts into the seven main categories of genomes besides Homo sapiens: viruses, bacteria, fungi, Arabidopsis thaliana ('the weed'), Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly), Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm), and M. musculus (mouse).
