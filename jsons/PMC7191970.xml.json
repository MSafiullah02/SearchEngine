Clinically, the infection of the novel coronavirus mainly affects the respiratory system leading to pneumonia, while the virus may also cause other organ damage such as derangement of renal and liver functions, cardiac injury, cellular immune deficiency, and coagulation activation. Currently there are no specific drugs for COVID-19, which is a self-limiting disease requiring sufficient time for a rigorous immune response [1].",

            "text": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Fig. 1) is a principal method for offering respiratory and circulatory support and providing a chance of survival for those desperately ill patients. Since the jelly exudates block alveolar oxygen exchange, mechanical ventilation might provide little help in patients with severe hypoxemia. It was recommended in both the WHO interim guidelines and Chinese expert consensus [3] that ECMO, preferably the veno-venous (V-V) ECMO mode (Fig. 1a), should be applied to eligible patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Veno-venous ECMO may benefit patients with COVID-19-related ARDS mainly by providing lung protection and extracorporeal CO2 removal. It is noteworthy that a few patients may develop concomitant heart failure, resulting from pneumonia-associated right heart failure, fulminant myocarditis, myocardial infarction, or sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, and might require veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO (Fig. 1b). A number of observational studies and non-controlled clinical trials in SARS reported a survival rate of 50\u201371% for patients receiving ECMO [4]. However, according to recently published ECMO cases with COVID-19 and those that we managed, the clinical outcome does not seem so satisfactory. The reason might be that the ECMO intervention was not made in time. Exploring predictors and identifying potential patients requiring ECMO intervention and early initiation of ECMO are therefore of vital importance. A high SOFA score, D\u2011dimer levels of >1 \u03bcg/ml, severe lymphopenia, and higher neutrophil counts have been reported as markers for poor prognosis at the early stage [5]. More studies are needed to get a deeper understanding of predictive markers in ECMO use.",

On the premise of the right use of PPE, physicians should consider initiating ECMO in a timely manner, reasonably, and efficiently for those eligible critical cases in the early stage and they should optimize the treatment strategies according to the patients\u2019 conditions. Early application of ECMO could avoid lung injury associated with hyperoxia and respirator-associated factors to improve refractory hypoxia and recover homeostasis. Although V\u2011V ECMO cannot provide circulatory support, it could improve cardiac function indirectly by reducing right heart load. The V\u2011A mode should be considered when ARDS has progressed to acute pulmonary heart disease and in the presence of cardiac shock or cardiac arrest due to new ischemia and inflammation. Moreover, during the use of ECMO, monitoring of hemodynamics and echocardiography as clinical observations are essential to prevent common complications of ECMO such as ischemia of the lower limbs, bleeding, thrombosis, infections, and excessive left-heart afterload.",
