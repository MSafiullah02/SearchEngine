The following terms were used as keyword searches: infection control, infection prevention, home health, readiness, disaster plan, mass casualties, bioterrorism, pandemic, and emergency management. Only English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals were considered. An Internet search was also conducted in July 2010 using the same search terms as above to identify existing book chapters, reports from response agencies, published standards and guidelines, and other relevant materials related to the development of home health emergency management plans to address biological MCEs that were outside the peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion criteria included articles, planning documents, and published reports that addressed infection prevention issues that need to be included in a plan. Articles that addressed hospital, community, public health, or personal preparedness were excluded. Also excluded were articles that only addressed non\u2013infection prevention emergency management issues, such as developing policies and procedures for incorporating the incident command structure into the home health emergency management plan. Both US-based and non\u2013US-based articles and documents/reports were included in the analysis.",

A total of 154 references were screened by reading the abstract. A spreadsheet was created that delineated the infection prevention issues in home health agency emergency management plans identified by each source. Infection prevention recommendations were divided into themes/domains for simplification and clarity. We each conducted a literature review and Internet search independent of one another, and then collated all sources for the review process. We divided the article review and data extraction responsibilities among ourselves. Each of us reviewed 4 of the same articles and then compared data extraction results as a quality control process to ensure consistency in data collection. Discrepancies and unclear areas were discussed until consensus was reached. Once all data were collated, the primary author categorized the findings into themes and developed the written recommendations. All of us reviewed the final themes and recommendations.",

One aspect of surge capacity is assessing on-hand resources and calculating amounts that might be needed during an MCE. For biological MCEs, this could include the need for equipment and supplies that would last up to 8 weeks (the estimated wave of a pandemic). These estimates also should take into account that other health care agencies will be placing strains on the supply system during this period, and thus normal supply needs might not be met. Examples of resources that need to be assessed include anti-infective medications, vaccines, respiratory protection, gowns, gloves, eye protection, and hand hygiene products. The need for extra home health personnel will likely be greater during a biological MCE compared with other disasters, because staff may be less willing or able to work during a biological event.4, 6, 24, 29, 31, 32 Factors that may influence health care workers\u2019 willingness and ability to work during a biological MCE include personal or family illness, family obligations, and fear of exposure or illness.29 Whenever possible, home health agencies should provide incentives for staff to encourage them to work during an MCE; examples of incentives include monetary, housing subsistence, health care access, child or adult family member care, and pet care.4, 17, 29 The plan should include protocols for stockpiling or obtaining additional staff and medical equipment/supplies.",
