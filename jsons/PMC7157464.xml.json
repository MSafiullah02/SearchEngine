Their Fab portions can bind to antigens, but except in rare instances, binding to antigen has little or no biological consequences. Some therapeutic antibodies raised against receptors (Li et al., 2005) or ligands (Ellis and Hicklin, 2008) can prevent ligand\u2013receptor interactions and some antireceptor antibodies can mimic agonists (Shan et al., 2000). It was recently shown, however, that to \u2018neutralize\u2019 bacterial toxins (Joller et al., 2010) or viruses (Mallery et al., 2010), antibodies require that their Fc portion binds to cellular receptors that transport immune complexes to intracellular compartments where they are degraded. For antibodies to affect antigens, they indeed not only need to bind to antigens through their Fab portions, but also to interact through their Fc portion with effector systems. These include soluble molecules such as components of the enzymatic cascade of Complement, and cells that express receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies (FcR).",

As they are equipped with pattern-recognition receptors which enable them to interact with structures borne or secreted by microorganisms, myeloid cells are the effector cells of innate immunity. Unlike lymphoid cells, they have no antigen receptors. Most of them, however, express FcR. When binding to FcR, antibodies provide these cells, with B-cell receptor-like immunoreceptors and a bona fide immunological specificity (Da\u00ebron, 1997). As these antibodies, polyclonal in nature, have different specificities, one FcR-expressing cell can respond specifically to a wide repertoire of different antigens. When binding to FcR, specific antibodies thus enroll effector cells of innate immunity in adaptive immunity. It follows that both innate and adaptive immunity use the same effector cells.",

Antibodies function as extracellular adapter molecules when their Fab and Fc portions bind simultaneously to specific epitopes on antigen and to FcR on cell membrane, respectively. BCR, TCR, and FcR are receptors for the three forms under which any given antigen can interact with and deliver signals to cells of the immune system.

Few FcR (Fc\u03b3RIIA in humans; Fc\u03b3RIIB and polyIgR in mice and humans) are single-chain receptors. Other FcR are multichain receptors composed of one immunoglobulin-binding subunit (FcR\u03b1) and one (FcR\u03b3) or two (FcR\u03b3 and FcR\u03b2) common subunits. FcR\u03b3 is a homodimer made of two disulfide bond-linked polypeptides highly conserved in mice and humans. Each polypeptide consists of a 5-amino-acid extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a 42-amino-acid intracytoplasmic domain. FcR\u03b3 is shared by all multichain receptors. FcR\u03b2 is a 4-transmembrane domain polypetide that associates with multichain FcR expressed by mast cells and basophils. FcRn is a unique MHC class I\u2013like molecule that binds the Fc portion of IgG instead of peptides (Burmeister et al., 1994).",

Their intracytoplasmic domain indeed contains a retention site that sequesters the polypetide in the endoplasmic reticulum, unless it associates with FcR\u03b3 (Letourneur et al., 1995; Lobell et al., 1993). The expression of these receptors therefore depends on the tissue distribution of FcR\u03b3, and FcR\u03b3-deficient mice have no activating FcR (Takai et al., 1994). Mouse Fc\u03b5RI, but not human Fc\u03b5RI, also need to associate with FcR\u03b2 (Kinet, 1999). As FcR\u03b2 is expressed by mast cells and basophils only in both species, the expression of Fc\u03b5RI is restricted to these cells in mice (Kinet et al., 1988), but not in humans (Gounni et al., 1994; Joseph et al., 1997; Gounni et al., 2001). Noticeably, mouse Fc\u03b3RIIIA, the expression of which requires FcR\u03b3 but not FcR\u03b2, associate with both subunits in mast cells (Kurosaki et al., 1992). FcRn do not associate with FcR\u03b3 but with \u03b2-2 microglobulin, like other MHC-I molecules and this association is mandatory: \u03b2-2 microglobulin-deficient mice do not express FcRn.",

Noticeably, the Ka of Fc\u03b5RI is especially high not because the association constant is high but because the dissociation constant is extremely low. The result is that, in spite of their extremely low concentration in plasma, IgE remain bound to Fc\u03b5RI for extended periods of time where they are ready to trigger mast cells and basophil activation when allergen comes.

Each heavy chain contains a single covalently attached biantennary N-glycan at the highly conserved N297 residue in its CH2 domain. Point mutations of this glycosylation site abrogate the ability of IgG antibodies to bind to Fc\u03b3R. If engineered with such a mutation (e.g., N297Q), aglycosylated antibodies therefore no longer engage Fc\u03b3R (Veri et al., 2007) and they can be used as blocking-only molecules. Aglycosylated antibodies against specific receptors or ligands can prevent receptor\u2013ligand interactions without engaging Fc\u03b3R. Noticeably, N297 mutations do not affect the binding of IgG to FcRn. Aglycosylated antibodies are therefore similarly protected from degradation as glycosylated antibodies. Other mutations that remove fucose residues from the glycan chain were found to enhance the binding of modified antibodies to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, irrespectively of the polymorphism that affects this receptor (Natsume et al., 2005; Niwa et al., 2005).",

Fc\u03b3RIIB are encoded by a single gene that generates two (Fc\u03b3RIIB1 and Fc\u03b3RIIB2 in humans) or three (Fc\u03b3RIIB1, Fc\u03b3RIIB1', and Fc\u03b3RIIB2 in mice) isoforms of membrane receptors, by alternative splicing of sequences encoded by the first intracytoplasmic exon (Hibbs et al., 1986; Lewis et al., 1986; Ravetch et al., 1986; Latour et al., 1996). The inhibitory properties of Fc\u03b3RIIB depend on an ITIM (Da\u00ebron et al., 1995), encoded by the third intracytoplasmic exon of the fcgr2b gene, present in the intracytoplasmic domain of all murine and human Fc\u03b3RIIB isoforms. Unlike activating receptors, Fc\u03b3RIIB trigger no intracellular signal upon aggregation. They trigger negative signals when they are coaggregated with activating receptors by immune complexes (Da\u00ebron et al., 1995). Under these conditions, the ITIM of Fc\u03b3RIIB is phosphorylated by the same src-family tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates ITAM in activating receptors (Malbec et al., 1998). Phosphorylated Fc\u03b3RIIB recruit inhibitory molecules that are brought into signalosomes. This renders inhibition signals dominant over activation signals (Lesourne et al., 2005; Da\u00ebron and Lesourne, 2006).",

Several FcR are coaggregated when IgG immune complexes interact with cells that coexpress several Fc\u03b3R or with cells that coexpress FcR for several classes of antibodies. Heteroaggregation, i.e., the coaggregation of different types of FcR or the coaggregation of FcR with other immunoreceptors, is actually a rule, rather than an exception, under physiological conditions. Because there are FcR for all antibody classes, because immune complexes contain more than one class of antibody, and because most cells express more than one type of FcR, various combinations of FcR can be engaged at the cell surface to form heteroaggregates with a nonpredetermined composition. FcR can thus generate a variety of signaling complexes, depending on the relative proportion of receptors of the various types that are coengaged by immune complexes.",

Many cells can synthesize cytokines, chemokines, or growth factors of different types. FcR therefore are involved in a variety of biological functions. These include pathogen clearance, toxin neutralization, antigen capture at the initiation of antigen presentation, cytotoxicity, and inflammatory responses. Biological functions, however, are not ensured by single cells but by cell populations. These consist of a mixture of various cell types that are either present or recruited by chemokines and/or that proliferate in response to growth factors, at the site of the reaction. The composition of such populations depends on time and location. Biological functions in which FcR are involved are therefore a resultant of the biological properties of the many cells that are engaged in the reaction at a given place and at a given time.

Likewise, Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice permitted to identify the many biological responses that are negatively regulated by these receptors. Neither FcR\u03b3-deficient mice nor Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice, however, were devoid of problems due to compensatory reactions occurring during development or to long-term consequences of a regulation loss. Cell-type-specific inducible FcR deficiencies based on the use of the Cre-Lox system have been developed to overcome these problems.

When such transgenic mice are made in normal mice, the human FcR is expressed in addition to endogenous murine FcR, making it difficult to determine the respective roles of human and murine FcR. Transgenic mice made in FcR-deficient mice are more informative. Unless they are used to assess the effect of passively administered human antibodies in short-term assays, one limitation is that mouse immunoglobulins do not bind identically to human and to murine FcR. To bypass this difficulty, such mice are being constructed using mice in which the locus containing CH genes have been replaced by the whole or a part of the human homolog.

This phenomenon explains why the half-life of IgG is about 22 days (Spiegelberg and Fishkin, 1972), whereas that of IgM, IgA, and IgE is only 5, 3, and 1 day, respectively (Butler, 1983). Inversely, Fc\u03b5RII keep the plasma concentration of IgE low. Fc\u03b5RII-deficient mice have high IgE levels because Fc\u03b5RII downregulates the production of IgE (Yu et al., 1994).",

FcRn expressed by human proximal kidney cells (Haymann et al., 2000; Kobayashi et al., 2002) may lower the elimination of IgG through urine by reabsorbing filtered IgG (Lobo et al., 2004). It has been also suggested that FcRn expressed by the mammary gland recycles colostral IgG into blood (Cianga et al., 1999). Mouse hepatocytes (Borvak et al., 1998; Telleman and Junghans, 2000) and human alveolar epithelial cells (Spiekermann et al., 2002) also express FcRn. Fc-coupled proteins administered in the airways reach the blood in an Fc-dependent manner (Low et al., 2005; Bitonti et al., 2004). When expressed in the intestine, FcRn were found both to deliver IgG into the lumen and to absorb immune complexes back (He et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2004). During pregnancy, the trans-placental transfer of maternal immunoglobulins to the fetus confers a protection to the fetus whose humoral responses are inefficient (Palmeira et al., 2012). IgG is the only immunoglobulin class that crosses the human placenta and ensures humoral protection (Kim et al., 2009). FcRn expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast and the fetal intestine (Shah et al., 2003; Simister, 2003) are mandatory for maternal IgG to be transferred to fetuses (Simister and Rees, 1985). Fc\u03b3RIIB expressed by human placental endothelium were believed to contribute to IgG transport. Recent studies in Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice, however, demonstrated that Fc\u03b3RIIB are dispensable (Mohanty et al., 2010). Altogether, these reports underline the unique role of FcRn in IgG transport.",

Follicular dendritic cells can trap immune complexes in secondary lymphoid tissues, and these complexes are periodically arranged like epitopes on T-independent antigens (Szakal et al., 1985). Fc\u03b3RIIB expressed by follicular dendritic cells can be engaged by the Fc portion of antibodies present in immune complexes and prevent them from binding to B cell Fc\u03b3RIIB (El Shikh et al., 2006). In the absence of Fc\u03b3RIIB on follicular dendritic cells, immune complexes can coengage the BCR with Fc\u03b3RIIB on B cells and inhibit B-cell activation. Antigen in immune complexes bound by follicular dendritic cells are thus far more potent inducers of antibody responses than free antigen. This phenomenon has been demonstrated both in vitro (Tew et al., 2001) and in vivo (Wu et al., 2008). Supporting this point of view, the blockade of Fc\u03b3RIIB expressed by follicular dendritic cells inhibited the ability of immune complexes to induce T-independent responses (El Shikh et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Although it has been known since the 1950s, IgG antibodies, especially of the IgG1 subclass, were recently rediscovered to induce PSA in mouse models (Miyajima et al., 1997). Fc\u03b3RIIIA are the only activating receptors that bind IgG1, and these receptors were demonstrated to be critical using Fc\u03b3RIIIA-deficient mice. Other recent studies confirmed the predominant role of Fc\u03b3RIIIA in anaphylaxis (Jonsson et al., 2011). Fc\u03b3RIV, however, a receptor that binds IgG2 only, was recently demonstrated to contribute to active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA), together with Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Jonsson et al., 2011). The expression of Fc\u03b3RIV is restricted to neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, and both cell types were found to contribute to systemic anaphylaxis (Jonsson et al., 2011; Strait et al., 2002). Fc\u03b3RIIIA, however, play a predominant role in anaphylaxis because they bind not only IgG2 but also IgG1 antibodies that are produced in much higher amounts than IgG2, and because they are expressed by mast cells and basophils (Mancardi et al., 2011). Fc\u03b3RIIIA-expressing mast cells are indeed mandatory for PCA (Hazenbos et al., 1996). One study reported the involvement of Fc\u03b3RI in PCA (Ioan-Facsinay et al., 2002). There is, however, no convincing evidence for a major role of Fc\u03b3RI in anaphylaxis. Fc\u03b3RIIB can inhibit IgG1-induced PCA. Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice indeed display markedly increased anaphylaxis compared to wild type mice (Takai et al., 1996; Ujike et al., 1999).",

Recent studies nevertheless demonstrated the ability of human Fc\u03b3R to induce allergic reactions using transgenic mice ((Jonsson et al., 2012) and Mancardi et al., 2013). Both human Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIA triggered IgG-induced PSA and ASA. Fc\u03b3RIIA expressed by mast cells were also responsible for IgG-induced PCA. A mouse deficient for all endogenous Fc\u03b3R and transgenic for all human Fc\u03b3R underwent anaphylaxis following an injection of aggregated human IgG (Smith et al., 2012). Finally, the transfer of human neutrophils expressing Fc\u03b3RIIA could restore anaphylaxis in resistant mice, suggesting that not only human Fc\u03b3RIIA, but also human neutrophils, can trigger IgG-induced anaphylaxis (Jonsson et al., 2011). It was recently found that IgG receptors expressed by human basophils function as inhibitors of cell activation. As a consequence, basophils failed to be activated by IgG immune complexes, and IgG immune complexes that coengaged Fc\u03b3R with Fc\u03b5RI on basophils inhibited IgE-dependent basophil activation in all normal donors tested (Cassard et al., 2012).",

            "text": "FcR are involved in most antibody-dependent autoimmune diseases. Although IgA or IgE can account for some autoimmune disorders such as nephropathy (Coppo et al., 1992) and bullous pemphigoid (Fairley et al., 2007), respectively, and although IgM-induced complement-dependent autoimmunity was reported, most pathogenic autoantibodies are of the IgG class. Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient C57BL/6 mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diseases when aging. Anti-DNA and antichromatin antibodies are found in these mice, which usually succumb at 8 months of age, due to fatal autoimmune glomerulonephritis (Ravetch and Bolland, 2001). Thus, Fc\u03b3RIIB seem to contribute to peripheral tolerance (Bolland and Ravetch, 2000). Inversely, all activating Fc\u03b3R contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. Antiplatelet-induced idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was prevented in FcR\u03b3-deficient mice (Fossati-Jimack et al., 1999). Fc\u03b3RI (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005), Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Fossati-Jimack et al., 1999), and Fc\u03b3RIV (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005) were demonstrated to contribute to platelet depletion using FcR-deficient mice. Each of these receptors was sufficient to induce ITP, suggesting a redundant role of activating Fc\u03b3R (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005). The involvement of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIV was also reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Seres et al., 1998), experimental hemolytic anemia (Meyer et al., 1998; Syed et al., 2009), glomerulonephritis (Fujii et al., 2003), and arthritis (Bruhns et al., 2003; Ioan-Facsinay et al., 2002; Mancardi et al., 2011). The role of Fc\u03b3RI in arthritis is however controversial as the blockade of Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIV in wild type mice abolished symptoms and neutrophil infiltration in the joints (Mancardi et al., 2011). The role of human FcR in experimental autoimmune diseases has been investigated in transgenic mice. Human Fc\u03b3RIIA induced ITP (Reilly et al., 1994) or arthritis (Pietersz et al., 2009). The expression of human Fc\u03b3RI in mice lacking activating FcR restored arthritis symptoms (Mancardi et al., submitted). The contribution of IgA and human Fc\u03b1RI in glomerulonephritis is well established (Launay et al., 2000). All FcR seem to play a redundant role in antibody-induced autoimmunity. Most of these FcR are expressed by mouse monocytes/macrophages and by neutrophils, the two cell types that are responsible for the phagocytosis of opsonized particles. Macrophages and neutrophils are mandatory for autoimmune diseases such as arthritis (Solomon et al., 2005; Wipke and Allen, 2001), lung inflammation (Skokowa et al., 2005), and thrombocytopenia (Tan et al., 2003). Slight differences were observed when autoimmune reactions were induced by different subclasses of mouse IgG. IgG2b-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) was dependent on Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIV, whereas IgG2a-induced AHA was dependent on Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIV, and Fc\u03b3RI (Baudino et al., 2008). AHA induced by low dose of autoantibodies seems to be induced only by Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Altogether, these data demonstrated the crucial role of every FcR in autoantibody-induced reactions. The role of FcR in human autoimmunity is highlighted by the successful use of IVIg and specific blocking antibody (see below).",

Antimyelin antibodies were found in multiple sclerosis, and antidopaminergic neurons antibodies in Parkinson's disease (McRae-Degueurce et al., 1988). These antibodies are thought to induce inflammation by activating FcR-expressing phagocytic cells. Many cells of the CNS express FcR, and immune cells are recruited from the bloodstream into the brain in these disorders. FcR\u03b3-deficient mice displayed a decreased phagocytosis in a model of Alzheimer disease (Das et al., 2003), less lesions and elimination of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in a model of Parkinson's disease (He et al., 2002), and a reduced mortality in a model of ischemic stroke (Komine-Kobayashi et al., 2004). Interestingly, Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice had an enhanced disease susceptibility, whereas mice lacking IgG activating FcR were protected in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (Robbie-Ryan et al., 2003). Furthermore, the reconstitution of resistant mice with Fc\u03b3RIIIA-expressing bone marrow\u2013derived mast cells, restored symptoms. In conclusions, the mechanism of autoantibodies production and deposition in CNS disorders is poorly documented, but the pathogenicity of these antibodies seems largely mediated by FcR.",

            "text": "Therapeutic approaches have been developed, based on the ability of FcR to induce phagocytosis and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). To this aim, one can use antibodies directed against antigen expressed by target cells. Once opsonized, these cells interact with FcR-expressing cells, and they are phagocytosed or killed by ADCC. Such therapeutic antibodies are used in cancer, bacterial infection, and some autoimmune disorders. Thus, the passive administration of specific IgG antibodies protects wild type mice, but not FcR\u03b3-deficient mice infected with Cryptococcus neoformans (Yuan et al., 1998). Likewise, the injection of antitumor antibodies can lead to a significant reduction of tumor mass in wt mice (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005), but not in FcR\u03b3-deficient mice (Clynes et al., 1998). Fc\u03b3RIIIA seem to play a predominant role in antitumor activity (Albanesi et al., 2012). Fc\u03b3RI (Bevaart et al., 2006) and Fc\u03b3RIV (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005), however, have been reported to participate to the reaction. Noticeably, no enhanced rejection was observed in Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice. Human Fc\u03b3RI triggered tumor clearance in transgenic mice injected with a humanized antibody (Mancardi et al., Blood, in press). This suggests that human FcR may be responsible for the antitumor effect of therapeutic antibodies. Several monoclonal antibodies such as Rituximab and Trastuzumab that are used in the clinics exert their therapeutic effects through FcR (Albanesi and Da\u00ebron, 2012). Rituximab is a humanized anti-CD20 antibody that has been approved for B-cell malignancies. It indeed kills CD20-expressing transformed B cells (Manches et al., 2003), and this antitumor activity is partially mediated by FcR. Rituximab is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis patients. Indeed, it eliminates autoimmune B cells that are responsible for the production of pathogenic antibodies (Shaw et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2004). Trastuzumab is an anti-HER2 antibody. It binds to breast, ovary, and lung cancer cells. In addition to blocking cell proliferation by preventing receptor dimerization (Yakes et al., 2002), Trastuzumab also induces tumor destruction by engaging FcR through its Fc portion (Clynes et al., 2000). Antibodies that target molecules expressed by dendritic cells can enhance antigen presentation and, therefore, T-cell dependent cytotoxicity against tumor cells through. This effect was reported to involve Fc\u03b3RIIB (Li and Ravetch, 2011).",

Supporting this conclusion, the administration of anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibodies to patients had some therapeutic effect (Clarkson et al., 1986). These antibodies can function as blocking-only antibody when engineered with a N297Q point mutation.

Initially conceived as a substitutive treatment of immunodeficiencies, IVIG proved efficient in several other pathologic conditions. High doses of IVIG had indeed antiinflammatory effects and they became an efficient treatment of several autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, ITP, or SLE (Bayary et al., 2006). This effect can be reproduced with IVIG Fc fragments, suggesting that FcR contribute to the antiinflammatory effect of IVIG (Anthony and Ravetch, 2010). The therapeutic effect of IVIG can be enhanced by increasing their concentration in sialic acid\u2013rich immunoglobulins (Kaneko et al., 2006). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Divergent hypotheses point out a role for FcRn, activating FcR, or Fc\u03b3RIIB, which can be saturated, blocked, or upregulated, respectively, by IVIG (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2007).",

            "text": "Therapeutic approaches of allergic disease mainly focus on IgE and/or Fc\u03b5RI. Recombinant soluble Fc\u03b5RI has been proposed to ameliorate allergic symptoms (Gavin et al., 1995). These recombinant molecules are expected to compete with endogenous Fc\u03b5RI for IgE and, indeed, an injection of a sufficient amount may decrease IgE. Another strategy was to target membrane Fc\u03b5RI with proapoptotic molecules, to induce the internalization of the complex and the subsequent killing of Fc\u03b5RI-expressing cells (Belostotsky and Lorberboum-Galski, 2004). Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the Fc\u03b5RI-binding site of IgE. It was developed to prevent mast cell and basophil sensitization by IgE. Omalizumab was however found to form IgE\u2013anti-IgE complexes that are rapidly degraded, so that serum IgE becomes undetectable (Djukanovic et al., 2004). As the half-life of Fc\u03b5RI is markedly reduced in the absence of receptor-bound IgE, basophils and mast cells have a reduced Fc\u03b5RI expression. In spite of some side effects (Vichyanond, 2011), Omalizumab efficiently reduces the severity of symptoms in allergic diseases such as asthma (Busse et al., 2001), seasonal rhinitis (Casale et al., 2001), and chronic urticaria (Kaplan et al., 2008). Experimental therapeutic approaches have been developed, aiming at coengaging Fc\u03b5RI or Fc\u03b5RI-bound IgE with mast cell or basophil Fc\u03b3RII (Zhu et al., 2002; Tam et al., 2004). Fc\u03b3RIIB were indeed found to exert a dominant inhibitory effect on Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b5RI in human basophils (Cassard et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Finally, antibody-dependent effector functions in immune responses depend on a variety of parameters. (1) They depend on the availability and on the nature of antibodies. Antibodies are present in relatively high concentrations in blood and hematopoietic organs, but in relatively low concentrations in peripheral tissues, such as skin. Local concentrations of antibodies can however be high, such as IgE in nasal polyps that contain IgE-secreting plasma cells (Takhar et al., 2005). The isotopic composition of immune complexes at a given time and at a given place is also critical. (2) They depend on FcR that are expressed by any given cell at a given time. High-affinity FcR may be occupied, at least in part, by antibodies of different specificities. Some FcR are inducible only; others are constitutively expressed but can be up- and downregulated by cytokines. The relative expression of FcR, especially of activating vs inhibitory FcR, on myeloid cells that are present at the same site is a critical parameter. (3) They depend on the tissue distribution of FcR. FcR-expressing cells have different functional repertoires. They may be present in low numbers and in defined proportions at the initiation of responses and be recruited in high numbers and different proportions in inflammatory infiltrates. In any case, FcR are central in all antibody-dependent reactions. They are therefore both potent potential tools and privileged targets for immunotherapy.",
