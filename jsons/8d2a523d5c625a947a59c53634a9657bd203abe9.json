            "text": "CD8 \u03e9 T cells play an important role in immune regulation and effective immune responses against tumor cells, viral infection, and intracellular pathogens. In this report, using tiger or 10BiT mice, we defined a population of IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 T cells that were induced by IL-4. These IL-10 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells possessed a strong inhibitory effect on the CD4 \u03e9 T cell proliferation in an IL-10-dependent and cell contact-dependent fashion. In comparison with IL-10 \u03ea CD8 \u03e9 T cells, IL-10 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells expressed an array of Th2-like cytokines (IL-4, IL-5), perforin, and granzymes, as well as the cell cycle regulatory protein Cdkn2a. Interestingly, knockdown of cdkn2a using siRNA reduced IL-4-induced IL-10 production significantly. Furthermore, CD8 \u03e9 T cells from Cdkn2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice produced a significantly lower amount of IL-10, and the effect was limited to CD8 \u03e9 T cells but not observed in CD4 \u03e9 T cells and APCs. Finally, IL-10 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells played a protective role in the TNBSinduced murine colitis model, indicating a critical role of this population of CD8 \u03e9 T cells in regulatory immune responses. Taken together, we have defined a population of IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 Tregs induced by IL-4 and mediated by Cdkn2a.",

Several functionally distinct subsets of CD8 \u03e9 T cells have been defined. Traditional Tc1 and Tc2 CD8 \u03e9 T cells play overlapping and different roles in tumor immunity [1] , viral infection [2] , and some allergic diseases [3] . Tc17 cells can be generated in vitro and in vivo and exert critical functions in tumor rejection and viral clearance [4, 5] . CD8 \u03e9 Tregs play an important role in maintaining immune self-homeostasis and resistance to autoimmune diseases. CD8 \u03e9 CD122 \u03e9 Tregs prevent and cure na\u00efve CD4 \u03e9 T cell-induced IBD [6] . Moreover, transferring CD8 \u03e9 CD28 \u03ea T cells into CD8deficient mice can suppress development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [7] . CD8 \u03e9 IL-10-producing T cells were found in several murine disease models, including coronavirus-induced encephalitis [8] , acute influenza virus infection [9] , and Salmonella and Leishmania infection [10] . Also, they were found in human HIV-1 infection [11] and chronic hepatitis C virus infection [12] .",

Several transcription factors have been found to regulate IL-10 expression through different mechanisms in macrophages or monocytes. c-Maf [25] , stat1 [26] , and stat3 [27] have been reported to be involved in IL-10 transcription regulation in the LPS signal transduction pathway, whereas Sp1 [28] or Sp3 [28] directly binds to some specific motifs of the IL-10 promoter to alter IL-10 mRNA levels. However, the comprehensive transcription networks that are responsible for IL-10 production and their regulation by the cytokine environments are still unknown.",

Interestingly, IL-10 expression by iTregs and Th2-differentiated CD4 \u03e9 T cells was not affected (Fig. 5C and D) . Moreover, IL-10 expression from splenic macrophages and CD11c \u03e9 DCs triggered by LPS was also not affected (Fig. 5E) , and the same result was also obtained from the bone marrow-derived DCs and macrophages (data not shown).

Finally, colon lengths of GFP \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cell-treated mice were also obviously longer than those in the GFP \u03ea CD8 \u03e9 T cells or PBS-injected groups and had no significant differences from those in the control group (Fig. 6D) .

It has also been reported that together with IL-12, IL-4 also induces IL-10 production by CD8 \u03e9 T cells [47] . Interestingly, we demonstrated that together with IL-2, IL-4 was sufficient to induce na\u00efve CD8 \u03e9 T cells to differentiate into IL-10-producing cells (Fig.  1) . Either IL-2 alone or IL-4 alone failed to induce significant levels of IL-10 (data not shown). In our preliminary experiments, cells cultured in the absence of IL-2 failed to survive and grow. We therefore speculated that IL-2 served as the growth and surviving factor in our system, and IL-4 played a critical role in inducing IL-10 production by CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Also, this process was dependent on TCR signaling-mediated activation, as even cytokine alone in the absence of T cell activation could lead to cell death (data not shown). Furthermore, this process was not affected by the presence of endogenous IFN-\u2425, as neutralizing IFN-\u2425 did not change the expression level of IL-10 ( Fig. 1 ). Our results thus provide an additional pathway for inducing IL-10 production by CD8 \u03e9 T cells.",

Although quite a few signaling factors were up-regulated upon IL-4 treatment, only knockdown of cdkn2a and blimp1 suppressed IL-10 expression significantly (Fig. 4) , and it was evident that these two pathways had no direct interaction (Fig. 4) . The critical role of Cdkn2a was confirmed further using Cdkn2a \u03ea/\u03ea mice, and the effect was restricted to CD8 \u03e9 T cells but was not identified in CD4 \u03e9 T cells or APCs (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, knockdown of gata3 failed to affect IL-4-induced IL-10 expression (Fig. 4) , implying that Cdkn2a is not downstream of GATA3. It is unclear whether Cdkn2a is downstream of phosphorylated Stat6 or directly downstream of TCR signaling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to define the role of this cell cycle regulatory protein in CD8 \u03e9 T cell differentiation, and further studies are required to explore the function of Cdkn2a in other cytokine-induced differentiation of CD8 \u03e9 T cells and their detailed signaling pathways.",

Recently, several reporter mice have been made to use GFP or Thy1.1 to indicate IL-10-expressing cells, such as tiger mice [10] and 10BiT mice [35] . By taking advantage of IL-10 GFP or Thy1.1 reporter mice, we demonstrated that IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 T cells possessed a strong, suppressive function in vitro via IL-10-and cell contact-dependent mechanisms (Fig.  3 ) and in vivo through suppressing IFN-\u2425 production (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, these IL-4-induced, IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 T cells expressed suppressing molecules (PD-1, CTLA-4), as well as a high level of Tc2 cytokines (Fig. 2) . Several subsets of CD8 \u03e9 Tregs have been identified, such as CD8 \u03e9 CD122 \u03e9 Tregs [6] , CD8 \u03e9 CD28 \u03ea T cells [7] , and Qa-1-restricted CD8 \u03e9 T cells [48] . It is interesting to define whether this population of IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 T cells is a new subset of CD8 \u03e9 Tregs. Further validation would be needed to study the gene expression profiles and functions of these IL-4-induced, IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 T cells.",

We demonstrated a protective role of these IL-10-producing CD8 \u03e9 T cells in this colitis model (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, colon tissue in mice injected with IL-10 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells showed a significantly decreased level of IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 6) , implying a possible mechanism of these IL-10 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells in TNBS-induced colitis through suppressing the Th1 response. Further studies are in progress to test the detailed molecular mechanisms of this population of CD8 \u03e9 Tregs in the TNBS-induced colitis model and its function in other inflammatory models.",

Further studies to understand the pathophysiological function of this subset of CD8 \u03e9 T cells will enable us to facilitate the effective CD8 \u03e9 T cells in protective immune responses against pathogens and tumors.
