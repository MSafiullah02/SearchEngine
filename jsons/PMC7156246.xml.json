Statistically significant matches were employed for calculating the similarity tree of the taxonomically-related coronaviruses on the basis of their relative NC protein sequences.

In this view, bat coronavirus RaTG13 is classified as the most similar to the circulating SARS-CoV-2, followed by SARS-CoV and the pangolin NC protein sequence. A separate clade is reserved to MERS-CoV and the NC protein sequences of the coronaviruses with tropism for camels (Camelus bactrianus) and dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius). Nucleocapsid proteins of bovine, canine and human enteric coronaviruses are depicted as sister groups of a third clade with lower similarity in relation to SARS-CoV-2; whereas, the avian coronavirus cluster apart since featured by the lowest similarity with the circulating SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic classification of the viruses on the basis of the NC protein sequence is further supported by the multiple sequence alignment performed on the whole protein sequence. Here, NC from bat coronavirus RaTG13 shows a similarity with the SARS-CoV-2 homologue slightly above 99%. NC from SARS-CoV, instead, is approximately 90.3% similar with the causal agent of COVID-19, followed by the NC sequence from pangolin CoV with almost 88% sequence similarity.

Thus, investigating whether immunological features of taxonomically related viruses are shared with the SARS-CoV-2 might be helpful for planning innovative diagnostic and prophylactic interventions. According to the One-Health approach, defining the distribution of epitopes among viruses capable of infecting synanthropic and/or domestic animals might represent a key strategy for assessing the plausible occurrence of cross-protection elicited by the continuous inter-relation existing between human and animal population. In this view, exposure to epitopes from synanthropic animals might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This would explain, at least in part, the early detection of class G immunoglobulins in newly infected subjects and the big divergence occurring in the clinical manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, other than preventing epitopes-exposed subjects from the severe form of COVID-19 [16].",

Our outcomes, instead, highlight a closer functional relationship between the bat RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 than the pair pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 when restricting the investigation to a key structural protein. Also, NC protein of pangolin CoV fails to align two epitope sequences, suggesting a separation between the functional adaptation and molecular evolution. Moreover, acknowledged the overall co-share of epitope sequences, the lack of epitope alignments might be of importance for an accurate elucidation of the role of pangolin as the intermediate host in the virus life cycle.",

Although featured by a lower level of homology with SARS-CoV-2 NC protein and the presence of some mismatches in the epitope sequence, these sequences are mapping in the same structural domains as SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and are likely to be recognized by the host immune system; thus, potentially involved in conferring partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection other being considered good candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.",

In line with the One-Health concept, extending the target of the studies to the environment and the animals which humans are continuously interacting with favor a better understanding of this complex phenomenon and help to adopt the most suitable containment measures. Continuing mapping the major epitopes known for the viral proteins is, in our view, a promising strategy. In this light, defining the map of the circulating epitopes among diverse geographical areas and considering the diverse people habits and animal population they are interacting with might also provide unevaluable information for the design of personalized prophylactic and diagnostic strategies, shaped in dependence of the geographical context and the subject\u2019s habits.
