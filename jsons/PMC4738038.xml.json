            "text": "Chronic tonsillitis (CHT) is one of the most common otolaryngologic diseases.1 CHT is rare in infants and older people. In young children, tonsillitis is one of the recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. CHT is a highly prevalent disease in the pediatric age group, and it peaks between 3 and 10 years of age and then declines.2, 3 In general practice children frequently visit with recurrent throat problems4 and the incidence of this disease accounts for about 7% of all visits to the pediatrician.3 Children with CHT experience discomfort, and the disease also impacts on social, emotional, and financial aspects for family members.5 Tonsilitis is an infection of the tonsils.6, 7, 8 Despite its high prevalence, the etiology of CHT has remained indistinct. The surface and deep bacterial flora of chronic inflamed tonsils consist of an abundance of probable pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, primarily of streptococcal origin.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Tonsils are part of the immune system. Therefore, due to the decrease in immunity and the tonsils' incompetence in helping the immune system, they actually become a source of recurrent infections.3 The current treatment option for CHT is tonsillectomy, but it is not the ultimate solution. The generally accepted criteria for tonsillectomy are at least three to seven episodes of tonsillitis per year in spite of medical therapy, but there is no international consensus.14",

Mainly derangement of Kapha and Rakta (blood) is preceded by impaired digestive capacity (Mandagni/Vishamagni) and obstruction of channels (Sroto Avarodha) namely Annavaha Srotas (gastrointestinal tract) and Pranavaha Srotas (respiratory tract) which is manifested as difficulty in swallowing, mouth breathing, choking spells at night, etc.15, 16 The present study was conducted to explore the efficacy of Kumarabharana Rasa (KR) in the management of chronic tonsillitis in children. KR has a combined action over vitiated Doshas due to its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and rejuvinative effects.",

            "text": "CHT is an inflammation of the tonsils caused by a microbial infection. The symptoms are usually mild and often related to the common cold. In streptococcal infection the tonsils often swell and become coated and the throat is sore. The patient has a temperature, foul-smelling breath and may feel quite ill. Therefore drugs with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects may be useful for treatment of CHT. Ayurveda, as well as recent experimental results indicate the ingredients of a poly-herbo-mineral formulation KR as having anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects. It is substantiated by the clinical observations among tonsillitis patients. The key ingredients being the metallic Bhasmas (purified calx), like Swarna Bhasma, is prepared by incinerating gold processed with herbal preparations.18, 19\nSwarna Bhasma promotes immunity through phagocytosis.20 Gold poly-herbal formulations are found to increases vitality and immunity.21 The clinical applications of Swarna Bhasma and gold salts in Ayurveda are known for rejuvenation and immunomodulation for some chronic diseases.22 Gold nanoparticles have significant applications in targeted drug delivery.23, 24\nSwarna Bhasma contains gold particles in the size range of nanoparticles.25 Recent studies shows that Swarna Bhasma contained not only gold, but also several microelements (Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Co, Mg, Ca, As, Pb, etc.). Animal model studies show Swarna Bhasma-treated animals significantly increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, which are responsible for reducing free radical concentrations in the body.19 The antioxidant effect of Swarna Bhasma is considered to be one of the mechanisms for the immunomodulatory mode of action of the formulation. Rajata Bhasma (silver calx) is a nanoparticulate complex of silver along with Sn, Cd, Mg, K, Na, S, Ca, P, Si, Al, Cl, Ar, In, Fe, Cu, Ba, Hg, or Cr.26 Recent scientific trends indicate emergence of metallic silver in the form of silver nanoparticles as a potential antimicrobial agent, specially important, as several pathogenic bacteria have developed resistance against various antibiotics.27",

            "text": "Herbal components like Amalaki (Phylanthus embellica)28, 29 and Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia)30 are having nourishing and rejuvinative property. Experimental studies reveal their immunostimulant activity which combats sepsis in animals.31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Vacha, Sunthi, Pippali, Ashwagandha, Yastimadhu, Amalaki, and Haritaki all have immunomodulatory properties.37, 38, 39, 40 Pippali is an important drug for the treatment of cough, common cold, and is useful as a digestive. The active principle piperine is known for its bio-enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects.41 Yasthimadhu is a prominent Rasayana known for its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and antiviral activities. It also enhances permeability in drug delivery systems.42 Yastimadhu (Glycerrhiza glabra) also has cytoprotective and demulcent effects and is a popular home remedy for minor throat infections. Biologically active substances in liquorice root include glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its aglycone (GA), phenolic compounds, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, lipids, sterine, etc. Many researchers have suggested that the effects on the production of interferon (IFN) and Th2 cytokines might be one of the mechanisms involved in the anti-infective process. Recently, glycyrrhizin has been found to be active in inhibiting replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus (FFM-1 and FFM-2) and also H5N1 influenza A virus-infected cells. GL is also reported to have modulatory effects on the complement system. Reports indicate that GL blocks C5 or a more distal stage of the complement cascade, suggesting that it might have a role in preventing tissue injury not only in chronic hepatitis, but also in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Chemical modification of GL and GA has been tried, and a significant improvement in anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antiulcer activities was observed. These observations indicate immune-modulating and biological response modifier activities associated with GL. Tinospora cordifolia (TC) is known for its immunomodulatory and cytoprotective activities Quaternary alkaloids and biotherapeutic diterpene glucosides of TC (syringin, cordiol, cordioside, and coriofolioside) showed an immunopotentiating activity. Research work has been conducted on berberine, jatrorrhizine, tinosporaside, and columbin, which shows a possible mechanism of immunomodulatory activity as an activation of macrophages, leading to increases in granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leukocytosis, and improved neutrophil function. TC also inhibits C3 convertase of the classical complement pathway. Research on polysaccharide (\u03b1-d-glucan) derived from TC shows the activation of nuclear killer (NK) cells, complement system, and Th1 pathway cytokines, coupled with low nitric oxide synthesis.43 Aswagandha has shown promising immunomodulatory effect in inflammatory experimental models.44 Sunthi (Zingiber officinalis) has anti-inflammatory property which inhibits LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation by preventing degradation of the I\u03baB-\u03b1, as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPKs which were associated with a decrease in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxyenase-2 (COX-2).45 Vacha (Acorus calamus) is reported for its inhibitory effect on mast cell-dependent anaphylactic reactions in allergic reactions of the respiratory tract.46 Amla (Phyllanthus emblica) has been reported to suppress the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes (COX-2, iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-16, and IL-6) in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells in a dose-dependent manner.47 Honey is known to enhance the action of these medicines, and has a potential immunomodulatory effect.48, 49, 50, 51",
