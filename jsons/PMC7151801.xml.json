            "text": "Reduced immunogenicity and thereby efficacy is an unfortunate downside to vaccines based on highly purified or synthetic antigens. This requires the use of vaccine adjuvants to improve vaccine immunogenicity. The term adjuvant has traditionally referred to as any substance that when added to a vaccine antigen increases its immunogenicity.1 As such, the study of adjuvant action is made complicated by the wide diversity of agents including small molecule immune modulators, mineral salts, oil emulsions, and even whole viruses or bacteria. These agents all exhibit adjuvant action in vivo with no one common feature explaining this activity. Almost certainly, these compounds work through many and varied different mechanisms to enhance immune responses to coadministered antigens. Increasing use of small protein or peptide antigens allows greater control over vaccine design and synthesis but has further exacerbated issues of poor immunogenicity. This necessitates closer examination of how best to design vaccine delivery and adjuvant systems to maximize antigen immunogenicity, assist targeted immune delivery, and provide potent adjuvant activity. Most importantly, this must all be done in a manner that does not compromise vaccine tolerability or safety.2., 3.\n",

            "text": "The immune system has evolved to protect against invading pathogens. As pathogens present as nano- to microsized particles, it should not be surprising that the immune system has evolved strategies to specifically recognize and respond to particles of particular sizes and shapes.4., 5. This helps explain the boost to immunogenicity when antigens are presented to the immune system as virus-like particles (VLPs) rather than as soluble proteins. Particle size was shown to be important for uptake by dendritic cells (DCs), with spherical particles less than 500 nm in diameter having better uptake than larger particles.6 Size is also relevant to T cell maturation whereby poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles modified with recognition and costimulatory ligands with similar dimensions to DCs were better able to induce T cell activation when compared with nanosized particles7 that were rapidly phagocytosed.8 While the idea that size is important to vaccine action is now well accepted, it is also likely that shape, texture, and surface chemistry are equally highly relevant to adjuvant action,8 albeit less well-explored.",

However, cell-culture systems used for manufacture of VLPs can be low yielding and expensive, and hence synthetic methods have been developed for VLP production. For example, short linear synthetic proteins with coiled-coil domains were used for self-assembly of \u03b1-helical motif-containing nanoparticles able to present repetitive epitopes on their surface.64., 65. These synthetic particles had a 25 nm diameter and elicited strong immune responses to surface-expressed epitopes.64., 65., 66. A related nanoparticulate vaccine delivery system was also assembled from peptide chains containing a coiled-coil sequence to drive helical assembly. In this instance the peptide was modified at the N-terminus with a dual chain lipid and with synthetic epitopes at the C-terminus. Upon dispersion in aqueous solution, the construct aggregated into ordered synthetic particles having a diameter of 17\u201320 nm and presenting multiple copies of the antigen on the surface that induced a humoral immune response.67\n",

Peptides having alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids can undergo a sol-gel transition upon exposure to physiological conditions whereby they form a hydrogel made up of interconnected nanofibers.70 In this way a mixture of biphasic oligopeptide, antigen, and adjuvants can be injected with the peptides, subsequently undergoing postinjection self-assembly into hydrated nanofiber gel matrices, forming an antigen and adjuvant depot in the aqueous phase.71 A self-assembling nanofibrous hydrogel induced an antibody response when tested as a vaccine delivery platform, either alone or formulated with CpG adjuvant (TLR9 agonist) as a delivery system for recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).71 Similarly, the self-assembling peptide Q11 conjugated to a CD8 T cell epitope of ovalbumin elicited a strong antigen-specific CD8 T-cell response.72\n",

For example, 165 nm-diameter liposomes assembled from cationic lipid, cationic polymer, and plasmid DNA were shown to target antigen to draining lymph nodes, resulting in enhanced DC activation and immunity.75 Coating of these liposomes with a cholesterol-modified mannan further enhanced the therapeutic anticancer action of an oncoprotein vaccine.76 As liposomes themselves are generally poorly immunogenic, they may require combination with other immunostimulatory adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity.4 For example, liposomal nanoparticles self-assembled from a mixture of phospholipids containing 5% pegylated lipid to prevent protein binding were used to target cyclic diguanylate as an agonist of stimulation of INF genes to draining lymph nodes, thereby enhancing vaccine potency.77 Single bilayer liposomes have also been constructed using viral lipid envelopes, retaining the viral cell binding and fusion glycoproteins and resulting in 150 nm-diameter virosomes that promote attachment to respiratory mucosal surface and subsequent fusion release of contents into the cytoplasm of endocytosing cells.78 Further, the viral components enhance the efficiency of the interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), making them an ideal vaccine delivery system.79., 80. More recent virosome research has included the incorporation of additional components to improve the particle formation and stability characteristics as well as enhance immunogenicity.81 For example, an amphiphilic saponin derivative (GPI-0100) was incorporated into a virosome and provided potent immunogenicity to allow the use of very low antigen doses.82\n",

A mixture of an anionic poly(\u03b3-glutamic acid) acid grafted with phenylalanine ethylester and a cationic \u025b-polylysine was self-assembled from aqueous solution into nanoparticles with 200\u2013300 nm diameter.83 When formed in the presence of ovalbumin, the particles were loaded with antigen and induced effective cellular and humoral immune responses in immunized mice.87 Poly(\u03b3-glutamic acid) has also been eletrostatically attached to complexes of dendrigraft poly-l-lysine with plasmid DNA. In this instance the poly(\u03b3-glutamic acid) moderates the cytotoxicity of the electrostatic complex to enable delivery and expression of genes in the spleen, suggesting application in vaccine formulations.88 This is related to a similar gene delivery formulation in which electrostatic interactions between positively charged polyethyleneimine and negatively charged plasmid DNA and poly(\u03b3-glutamic acid) were used to construct a nanoparticle DNA vaccine. This formulation conferred protection against malaria infection in mouse models.84 Standard PLGA particles have negative charge, and electrostatic interactions have been identified as a critical aspect of the binding to protein antigens. Consequently, protein binding can be tuned through adjusting the pH of binding conditions to optimize the charge differential between components.89 PLGA nanoparticles have also been constructed with positive charge using PRINT technology through the incorporation of cationic additives. These particles were specifically designed to electrostatically interact with commercial hemagglutinin antigens to generate an influenza vaccine with enhanced immune responses compared with the hemagglutinin alone.12., 13.\n",

            "text": "As previously suggested by their use in emulsion and liposome adjuvants, saponins can provide potent immunogenicity to vaccine formulations. A commonly used adjuvant is the saponin QS21, which is an acylated saponin at the 4-hydroxyl position on fucose with two linked 3,5 dihydroxy-6-methyloctanoic acids.97 QS21 induces inflammatory cytokines and imparts a Th1 bias in vaccine responses,98., 99. but because of its ability to lyse cell membranes, hemolysis and injection site pain are major limiting factors in its use.100 QS21\u2019s toxicity can be reduced by forming it into an immune-stimulating complex (ISCOM), which is a spherical particle of \u223c40 nm diameter that self-assembles from specific mixtures of cholesterol, phospholipids, and QS21.101., 102., 103. An advantage of ISCOMs is that the toxic hemolytic effect of the saponin is moderated by its incorporation into the liposomal structure while its immune-stimulatory properties are retained. The liposomal particle also helps target the saponin adjuvant and antigen formulation to the draining lymph nodes.5 While initially thought important for immunogenicity that antigens were loaded inside the ISCOM structure, it is now recognized that adjuvant action can be achieved by simple admixture of the antigen with the ISCOMs, a major advantage as many antigens are difficult to load into the particles.104\n",

This is clearly seen with the polysaccharide inulin (\u03b2-d-[2-1] poly(fructo-furanosyl)-d-glucose), a natural plant-derived storage carbohydrate of plants of the Compositae family that has no immunological activity when in the usual soluble form but has potent adjuvant activity when crystallized into the nanostructured delta inulin microparticles.105., 106., 107., 108. Delta inulin particles have been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses to a wide variety of viral, bacterial, and protozoan antigens as well as toxins and allergens. For example, enhanced vaccine protection was seen in models of influenza,109., 110. Japanese encephalitis,111., 112. West Nile virus,113 hepatitis B,114 human immunodeficiency virus,115 anthrax,116 SARS coronavirus,117 listeriosis,118., 119. and African horse sickness.120 Its adjuvant effects are seen across a broad range of animal species including mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, chickens, dogs, sheep, monkeys, horses, and camels. It has proved effective in human studies when combined with a recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine,121 a hepatitis B vaccine,122 or a bee sting allergy vaccine.123 An interesting feature of delta inulin is its ability to enhance adaptive immune responses even when injected a day prior to the antigen, a feature not shared by alum adjuvant.114 Delta inulin does not work like other polysaccharide adjuvants, as it has not been found to activate innate immune receptors such as TLRs, Dectin-1, or the inflammasome. Instead, delta inulin adjuvant appears to work by directly modulating DC function, thereby resulting in enhanced antigen presentation to memory T and B cells. This was recently shown in human subjects to translate into enhanced B cell receptor affinity maturation with upregulation of activation-induced cytidine deamidase in day 7 postimmunized plasmablasts.124 Notably, delta inulin has proved safe and effective when administered to pregnant dams125 or their 7-day-old mouse pups 126 and, in a large animal model, to either pregnant mares or their foals,127 a feature that may be attributable to its noninflammatory mode of action. Interestingly, a powder particle formulation of delta inulin has recently been shown to be safe and effective when administered with influenza vaccine directly into the lungs of mice,128 opening up a further novel vaccine application of this technology.",

Mannosylated niosomes composed of span 60, cholesterol, and stearylamine (all coated with the modified polysaccharide O-palmitoyl mannan) have been used as orally administered DNA vaccine carriers with a demonstration of enhanced mucosal immunity in mice.132 A similar approach using O-palmitoyl mannan coating was used to target niosomes to Langerhan\u2019s cells in the skin after topical delivery.133 Chitin, a linear \u03b2-1\u20134-linked polymer of d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine extracted from shrimp, and chitosan, obtained by partial deacetylation of chitin, act by binding innate receptors including Dectin-1, macrophage mannose receptor, and TLR-2.134 Chitosan particles produced by cross-linking with a counter ion were used to entrap antigen and enhance its immunogenicity in mice.135 By virtue of their mucoadhesive qualities, particles coated with chitin and its derivatives have been extensively used as nasal adjuvants for delivery of inactivated136 or even live viral vectors. Hence mucosal delivery of adenoviral vectors microencapsulated in a chitosan microparticle not only helped to protect and improve the viability of the viral vector but also made its release dependent on cell surface contact.137\n",

A modified form, MTP-PE, was the key immune stimulator for which the original MF59 emulsion adjuvant was designed as a delivery system, given the highly hydrophobic nature of MTP-PE.40 Ironically, the combined MTP-PE in MF59 formulation was abandoned because of excess reactogenicity,41 but the MF59 vehicle was found to have some adjuvant activity in its own right, and hence its use in influenza vaccines was continued. In a similar fashion, liposomes formulated with DTP-GDP (N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala-d-isoGlu-l-Ala-glyceroldipalmitate) had potent adjuvant activity and induced remission in human metastatic colorectal cancer, although reactogenicity with fever, chills, and hypotension was a problem at higher doses.138., 139. The combination of chitosan microparticles with the mucosal toxin-based adjuvant LTK63 significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of an intranasal group C meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine in mice.136 Similarly, intranasal administration of alginate-coated chitosan nanoparticles loaded with antigen and CpG adjuvant enhanced antibody and cellular responses in mice.140 CpG has also been incorporated as the hydrophilic head group into a lipid-like adjuvant macromolecule, the hydrophobic tail composed of cholesterol, simple monoacyl, or diacyl lipidic groups.

This resulted in formation of spherical 1.5 \u03bcm-diameter inulin particles encapsulating the ovalbumin with high efficiency.142 These antigen-loaded inulin microparticles improved APC uptake of ovalbumin and enhanced antiovalbumin antibody responses in mice. Emulsions have similarly been used as templates to precipitate many other biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles for use in vaccine delivery, including the formation of PLGA nanoparticles from a nanoemulsion. The PLGA nanoparticles acted as an antigen delivery system although, unlike inulin particles, the PLGA particles themselves appeared to have no intrinsic adjuvant properties with an immunomodulator being required to create a strong immune response.15., 143.

Poly(ortho ester) microparticles of 5 \u03bcm diameter produced in this way were used to deliver plasmid DNA antigen to APCs. The acidic conditions in the APC lysosome degraded the orthoester bonds holding the particles together, thereby releasing the DNA. The DNA was then transcribed into protein that was presented to T and B cells, resulting in a cellular and humoral memory response.144 In another example, size-tuneable cross-linked poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 25 to 250 nm were prepared from emulsions, with monomers in the water phase stabilized by Pluronic F-127.145 Particle size was then controlled by varying the concentrations of the monomer and surfactants in the emulsion. These particles presented pluronic hydroxyl groups at the surface, resulting in complement activation, DC maturation, and a strong adjuvant effect.14 Such particles are unstable and release any attached drug under oxidative conditions, such as those found in the lysosome.14., 145. The ability to produce particles of different sizes enabled the effect of particle size on antigen delivery to be directly studied, revealing that small 20\u201325 nm nanoparticles delivered attached antigen to draining lymph nodes with 10-fold higher efficiency than 100 nm particles.14., 19.

The mold is filled with the desired material under pressure and then allowed to set. Release of the material from the mold produces particles in the nano- or microscale that can have complex and highly conserved morphology.9 This technology has been used for a range of medical applications, including production of stimuli-responsive targeted drug delivery vehicles9., 146. and vaccine adjuvants.13 The size, shape, and chemistry of PRINT nanoparticles can be optimized to maximize their transport to lymph nodes, enabling their use as an antigen delivery vehicle.12 This work found that anionic 80 x 180 nm cylinders covalently bound to ovalbumin through a 500-dalton polyethylene glycol spacer optimized delivery of antigen to lymph nodes and enhanced vaccine responses.12\n",

            "text": "This chapter highlighted the increasing sophistication of vaccine adjuvant design driven by the convergence of improved immunological understanding of the importance of nanofeatures to adjuvant function together with advanced nanomanufacturing techniques that allow very precise control of particle size, shape, texture, and surface chemistry. Principles from antigen design (eg, particle self-assembly) are increasingly being incorporated into adjuvant nanoparticle design. These individual concepts are now being applied to the design of a single integrated vaccine particle, incorporating antigen, adjuvant, and APC-targeting strategies. In the process, the concept of what is an adjuvant needs to be broadened to not only include specific immune-stimulatory substances but also to include any vaccine design features that enhance immune responses against a relevant antigen. Thus, the definition of an adjuvant could potentially now include aspects of antigen formulation such as nanoparticle incorporation; aspects of particle size, shape, and surface chemistry that enhance immunogenicity; or even purely physical processes such as texturing of the particle surface to maximize immunogenicity. Looking forward, adjuvants will increasingly not be seen as separate add-on items but as wholly integrated elements of a complete vaccine delivery package. Vaccine systems are steadily approaching the complexity and sophistication of the pathogens they mimic, with particle properties and behaviors designed to maximize long-term immune protection while maintaining a high safety profile.",
