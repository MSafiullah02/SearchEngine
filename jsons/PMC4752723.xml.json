During the 2002\u20132003 epidemic, SARS-CoV infected approximately 8,000 individuals, with a 10% overall mortality (Peiris et al., 2004). More recently, MERS-CoV was identified in 2012 in a patient in the Middle East (Zaki et al., 2012). Since its emergence, MERS-CoV has infected 1,626 patients, resulting in 586 deaths (January 15, 2016, 36.0% mortality) (WHO, 2016). The identification of MERS-CoV and other zoonotic CoVs (Ge et al., 2013, Menachery et al., 2015) makes it likely that these viruses will continue to cross species and cause additional disease outbreaks in human populations.",

High initial virus titers and increased monocyte-macrophage and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs associated with elevated serum pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10, and MCP-1) levels accompanied extensive lung damage in SARS patients (Franks et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004). Studies of SARS patients with severe disease revealed diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial necrosis, and fibrin and hyaline deposition, characteristic of acute lung injury (ALI) (Nicholls et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2004). Additionally, fatal SARS in humans was accompanied by robust and persistent expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Cameron et al., 2007, Cameron et al., 2008), associated with impaired T cell and antibody responses (Cameron et al., 2007, Cui et al., 2003). Thus, the deleterious clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV could stem from a combination of exuberant innate immune responses and virus-induced direct cytopathic effects. Consistent with a dysregulated innate immune response in patients, infection of human macrophages and dendritic cells is abortive, with elevated expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines but delayed expression of type I interferon (IFN-I), critical for initiation of the anti-viral innate immune response (Law et al., 2005, Spiegel et al., 2006, Yen et al., 2006). IFN-I induction is also delayed after infection of a human airway epithelial cell line (Menachery et al., 2014).",

In contrast, infection of BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV resulted in rapid virus replication associated with increased monocyte/macrophage accumulation, pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, diffuse alveolar damage, and destruction of the alveolar/airway epithelium (Gralinski and Baric, 2015, Roberts et al., 2007, van den Brand et al., 2014), similar to the disease observed in patients with severe SARS. Infected aged mice of all strains examined also developed severe disease, paralleling the age dependence observed in human SARS (Chen and Subbarao, 2007, van den Brand et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2011).",

Since persistent elevation of IFN-I suggested a pathogenic role in SARS patients, we explored the possibility that IFN-I was critical in the initiation of events that led to lethal lung immunopathology, using BALB/c mice. Previous studies showed that IFN-I, II, and III signaling or combinations thereof were dispensable for protection of young C57BL/6 or 129 mice after SARS-CoV infection (Frieman et al., 2010, Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2012). However, these studies did not address the role of IFN-I in the context of severe disease. Here, we show that IFN-I signaling is detrimental in highly susceptible SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice, in large part by promoting the influx of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs), and suggest that targeted antagonism of this pathway would improve outcomes in patients with severe coronavirus infections.",

In contrast, Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly reduced levels of cytokines and chemokines in the BALF compared to BALB/c mice (Figure 2C). Since this delayed inflammatory mediator expression might contribute to a subsequent excessive innate immune response, we next examined whether IFN-I delivered prior to the peak of virus replication would reverse this phenotype and enhance survival. For this purpose, we administered recombinant IFN-\u03b2 (2000 U) intranasally at various times after infection. In agreement with previous results (Kumaki et al., 2011), IFN-I delivered 6 hr p.i., prior to the peak of virus replication, but not at 24 hr p.i., completely protected mice from weight loss and clinical disease. IFN-\u03b2 delivery at 12 hr p.i. resulted in an intermediate level of protection (Figure 2D). Treatment with IFN-\u03b2 at 6 hr p.i. moderately reduced virus titers in the lungs at day 1 p.i (Figure 2E).",

While Siglec-H is expressed on pDCs and macrophage subsets in lymphoid tissues, it is primarily expressed on pDCs in the lungs (Swiecki et al., 2014; data not shown). pDCs from infected mice expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN\u03b14 mRNA compared to Siglec-H\u2212 cells (Figure 2F). Consistent with these results, human pDCs are also robust IFN producers after SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007). AMs also expressed IFN-I, but not to a greater extent than non-AMs. We also stained tissue sections for IFN-\u03b2 to assess IFN-I in other pulmonary cells and detected expression in airway cells and interstitial cells (Figure 2G). Collectively, these results suggest that many cell types, but most importantly pDCs, express IFN-I after SARS-CoV infection in mice and likely humans.",

In contrast, there was a dramatic increase in numbers of Ly6ChiCD11b+ cells in the lungs of BALB/c mice, and this increase was abrogated in the absence of IFN-I signaling (Figures 3A and 3B). At day 3 p.i. there was an approximately 6-fold increase in the numbers of infiltrating Ly6ChiCD11b+ cells in the lungs of BALB/c compared to Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3B). Phenotypic examination revealed that these cells expressed CCR2, F4/80, and CD11c, but not Ly6G and Siglec-H, suggesting that they were IMMs (Serbina et al., 2003) (Figure 3C). Furthermore, surface levels of CD69, BST-2, CD80, and CD86 were significantly higher on IMMs harvested from BALB/c compared to Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Figure 3D), consistent with greater activation. CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12, which are ligands for CCR2, as well as GM-CSF, a macrophage growth factor, are involved in IMM recruitment (Shi and Pamer, 2011, Song et al., 2015). While the expression of CCR2 ligands was significantly reduced at 24 and 72 hr p.i., GM-CSF expression was reduced at 16 hr p.i., but not at later times, in the lungs of Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 compared to BALB/c mice (Figure S3B). CCL2 was produced predominantly by IMMs when measured directly ex vivo (Figure S3C), and direct IFN-I signaling was sufficient to induce CCR2 ligand expression by bone marrow cells (Figure S3D). Thus, IFN-I signaling promoted accumulation of highly activated IMMs in SARS-CoV-infected lungs, and this process was amplified by IMM production of CCR2 ligands.",

These analyses revealed significantly higher percentages and numbers of IMMs that produced these pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALB/c compared to Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Figure 3E). We next assessed whether IMMs were the predominant source of these cytokines in SARS-CoV-infected lungs by depleting IMMs with anti-CCR2 antibody (MC21 mAb) since CCR2 is specifically expressed at high levels on pro-inflammatory monocytes (Mack et al., 2001). MC21 antibody specifically depleted CD11b+Ly6Chi IMMs, reducing the levels to those observed in Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures S4A and S4B).

            "text": "To directly establish a link between augmented IMM infiltration and SARS-CoV-induced lung immunopathology, we depleted IMMs using MC21 mAb. Treatment with MC21 mAb resulted in protection from lethal disease confirming a critical role for IMMs in promoting SARS-CoV-induced morbidity and mortality (Figure 4\nA). To confirm these results, we treated another cohort of mice with anti-BST-2-depleting antibody, as BST-2 was highly expressed on activated IMMs (Figure 3D). BST-2 is expressed constitutively on pDCs and is upregulated on IMMs and some stromal cells by inflammatory stimuli (Blasius et al., 2006). BST-2 depletion completely protected BALB/c mice from lethal SARS-CoV challenge, whereas approximately 70% of control Ig-treated mice succumbed to infection (Figure 4C). IMM depletion with either antibody minimally affected lung virus titers (\u223c2-fold) (Figures 4B and 4D). Histological examination of MC21 or anti-BST-2 mAb-treated lungs showed reduced alveolar edema and bronchial epithelial sloughing with no change in cellular infiltration, compared to control Ig-treated mice (Figure 4E). Additionally, depletion of IMMs also reduced vascular leakage (Figures S2A\u2013S2C). Notably, treatment with MC21 also decreased the numbers of pDCs in lungs (Figure S4D) even though these cells do not express CCR2 (Figure S4E), perhaps by decreasing chemokine expression. As noted above, IMMs express high levels of inflammatory cytokines (Figure 3E), resulting in elevated levels in the lungs (Figure 2C), which could contribute to more severe disease in BALB/c mice. Consistent with this notion, neutralization of a single pro-inflammatory mediator, TNF, which was most increased when BALB/c and Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 IMMs were compared (Figure 3E), provided partial, but significant, protection compared to control mice (Figure 4F). Although these results demonstrate a key role for IMMs in severe disease in SARS-CoV-infected mice, neutrophils are often detrimental in respiratory viral infections (Brandes et al., 2013). However, as noted above, neutrophil numbers are marginally higher in BALB/c mice (Figure S3A), and neutrophil depletion had no effect on survival (Figure 4G). Collectively, these results demonstrate roles for IMMs at several steps in the inflammatory process, resulting in immunopathological changes in SARS-CoV-infected mice.",

To address this, we generated bone marrow chimeras between CD45 disparate BALB/c and Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. Engraftment of donor cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of CD45.1 and CD45.2 expression on peripheral blood leukocytes 5 weeks post-transfer (Figure 5\nA). 6 weeks after bone marrow reconstitution, chimera mice were challenged with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV. Only 10% of mice in the Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212\u2192 Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 group and 20% of those in the Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212\u2192BALB/c group died after challenge.

The relative susceptibility of bone marrow chimeric mice to SARS-CoV infection correlated with the numbers of IMMs infiltrating into the lungs at day 3 p.i. (Figures 5C and 5D). Thus, increased IMM infiltration was observed in mice reconstituted with BALB/c bone marrow, while mice that received Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow were mostly resistant to SARS-CoV infection (Figures 5C and 5D). Together, these results demonstrate that IFN-I signaling, largely on hematopoietic cells, promoted lung immunopathology in SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice.",

Moreover, we observed no differences in expression of molecules associated with the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Figure S5G). By contrast, neutralization of TNF decreased the amount of T cell apoptosis (Figures S5H and S5I), indicating a direct or indirect role for TNF in this process.",

These results parallel findings obtained in SARS patients. Fatal outcomes in humans were often accompanied by high initial viral loads (Chu et al., 2004) and immunopathological disease with elevated IFN-I and cytokine levels (Cameron et al., 2007). Increased numbers of macrophages in the lungs were characteristic of patients who had severe SARS (Franks et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003). Exogenous IFN-I delivered prior to peak virus titers abrogates this cascade of events and ameliorates immunopathological disease (Figures 2D and 2E).",

            "text": "Although the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of IFN-I are well recognized as protective against viral infections, it has become increasingly evident that IFN-I also promotes detrimental inflammatory responses in some bacterial, fungal, and chronic virus infections through a complex array of mechanisms that tend to be pathogen specific (Carrero, 2013, McNab et al., 2015, Trinchieri, 2010). Thus, IFN-I promotes pathological effects during intracellular bacterial infections (e.g., M. tuberculosis, L. monocytogenes) by suppressing neutrophil and monocyte production of key effector molecules (TNF and IL-1), allowing uncontrolled bacterial replication (Auerbuch et al., 2004, Mayer-Barber et al., 2014). In a second mechanism, IFN-I induces fatal immunopathology during some fungal infections (e.g., Candida albicans) by promoting IM and neutrophil-mediated kidney immunopathology (Majer et al., 2012). Furthermore, during persistent viral infections such as those caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or SIV, IFN-I promotes chronic immune activation and upregulates the expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 and LAG-3, resulting in impaired T cell responses (Sandler et al., 2014, Teijaro et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2012, Wilson et al., 2013). Lack of IFN-I signaling during PR8/IAV infection results in accumulation of CXCL1-producing Ly6Cint monocytes with subsequent neutrophil influx, resulting in lung pathology (Seo et al., 2011). In contrast, infection of some mouse strains with IAV was lethal, and this lethality was ameliorated in the absence of IFN-I signaling (Davidson et al., 2014). Unlike severe IAV infections, lack of IFN-I signaling during a highly lethal SARS-CoV infection did not promote lung neutrophil infiltration but rather decreased IMM accumulation (Figures 3 and S3A).",

Although IMMs are pathogenic in SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice, they may be either protective or pathogenic, dependent upon the pathogen in question. In another model of SARS in which STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice are infected with SARS-CoV, macrophages are pathogenic, but in this instance pathological changes in the lungs are caused by conversion of a M1 (classical) to a M2 (alternatively activated) phenotype contributing to increased fibrosis and poor outcomes. In these mice, abrogation of STAT-1 signaling specifically in monocyte-macrophage subsets promoted lung pathology (Frieman et al., 2010, Page et al., 2012, Zornetzer et al., 2010). During respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and West Nile virus (WNV) infections, IMMs mediate virus clearance and are protective (Goritzka et al., 2015, Terry et al., 2012). In contrast, in mice infected with the pathogenic PR8 strain of IAV, IMMs have dual effects: promoting lung pathology as well as being required for optimal virus-specific T cell responses (Aldridge et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008).",

Our results show that TNF contributes to lethal disease since its neutralization enhances survival (Figure 4F), but it is likely that other cytokines expressed by IMM such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and iNOS, among others, have detrimental effects. IFN-I-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines induce TRAIL-DR5 or FasL-Fas expression on myeloid and T cells involved in T cell apoptosis (Boonnak et al., 2014, Daigneault et al., 2012, Kayagaki et al., 1999). We identified increased T cell apoptosis in SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c compared to Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, but unlike earlier studies (Boonnak et al., 2014) we found that neither FasL-Fas or TRAIL-DR5 pathways nor intrinsic apoptosis pathways were involved in this process (Figure S5). Augmented T cell apoptosis likely contributed to suboptimal T cell responses (Figure 6). Since T cells dampen cytokine storms by suppressing the innate response (Kim et al., 2007), suboptimal T cell responses may result in unchecked innate immune responses, causing prolonged production of pro-inflammatory mediators and subsequent immunopathology.",

            "text": "In summary, we demonstrate that delayed expression of IFN-I orchestrates the induction of an inappropriate inflammatory response and consequent lung immunopathology during SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, minimal differences in lung virus loads in Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 and BALB/c mice and complete protection after IMM depletion suggest that IFN-I-dependent immunopathological events, largely independent of virus replication, promote SARS-CoV morbidity and mortality. The protective effect of early, but not late, IFN-I administration in SARS-CoV-infected mice (Figure 2D; Haagmans et al., 2004, Kumaki et al., 2011) and pathogenic effects of a delayed IFN-I response suggest that IFN-I should be used judiciously in infected patients. Further, in addition to reducing initial viral load through anti-viral interventions, therapeutic approaches that moderate immunopathology may help reduce the high case fatality rates associated with emerging coronaviruses and perhaps other high pathogenic virus infections.",
