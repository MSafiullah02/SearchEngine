At KHCC, a terminally ill cancer patient is defined as either a patient with a progressive metastatic cancer (either having exhausted all lines of oncological treatment or declined treatment) with an expected prognosis of less than 6 months or a patient with multiple-organ failure who is actively dying (7, 8) . Prior to referral to the palliative care team, the primary oncologist explores and documents the patient's preference regarding resuscitation. Following referral to palliative care, the team routinely discusses goals of care with the patient and their family, which includes the patient's wishes for resuscitation. In Jordan, health care decisions tend to be family centred, rather than patient centred. It is common for patients to elect their family to receive health updates and make decisions regarding their care. Not all patients follow this 'cultural norm' and as in every setting, our team must explore with every patient their preference for receiving information and decision making. These procedures have been developed to ensure that decision-making reflects cultural preferences and practices. (9) Importantly, this approach means that the majority of patients and families receiving palliative care at KHCC understand and agree with reaching a DNR decision. In 2019, 483 of the 581 palliative care patients who died had a DNR order in place (83.1%).",

The committee unanimously passed an amendment to the DNR policy to preserve ICU beds and ventilator support for patients with a good prognosis. The ethics committee agreed that any patient with metastatic disease and progressive cancer with a poor prognosis or patients with multi-organ failure with a poor prognosis would not be offered cardiorespiratory resuscitation. Poor prognosis was defined by the committee to be any patient with an estimated prognosis of less than 3 months, utilising the oncologist's clinical prediction of survival, either by a temporal question ('how long does the patient have') or a surprise question ('will you be surprised if this patient dies within 3 months?') (10) . Additionally, the palliative care team utilizes the palliative prognostic index (PPI), a prognostic model to predict poor prognosis (11) . All decisions and rationale not to resuscitate must be communicated clearly and timely with the patient if possible, and with the family (12) . The patient and family must be reassured that compassionate care and symptom control will not be compromised.",
