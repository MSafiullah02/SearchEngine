Many incidents caused by material other than biological contaminants are often initially classified as suspected infectious incidents but, when the full picture becomes clear, they are found to have other causes for example, intoxication by chemical or radiological agents. One reason for this is that most societies have surveillance systems that most of the time direct their major interest toward the more common entity: infectious diseases.",
