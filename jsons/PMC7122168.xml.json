Brain peptidases participate in the general metabolism of peptides (proteins). In addition, they are possibly involved in neurotransmission. The neuropeptidases that have been actively studied in the last 15 years are emphasized here. For the other peptidases, please refer to the author's former review (Hui and Lajtha, 1983).",

They are widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system, where they serve as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Deficiency of neuropeptides, for example, ACTH, can cause various neurological signs (Sato et al., 1991). The neurophysiological abnormalities include slow wave activity on electroencephalograms, delayed conduction velocity of the peripheral nerves, and low amplitude of muscle action potentials. Recent interest has focused on the role of neuropeptides in degenerative neurological diseases. Understanding this role could help define what is specifically vulnerable to the pathological processes, thus leading to improvement in diagnosis and therapy.",

The reduced cortical concentrations of somatostatin and NPY in the cerebral cortex of patients with AD reflect a loss of neurons or terminals in which these two peptides are co-localized (Beal and Martin, 1986). Somatostatin concentration is reduced in the hippocampus and neocortex of patients dying with Alzheimer's type dementia. The levels of TRH and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone neuropeptides are significantly reduced in patients with senile dementia.

In most neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, massive neuronal cell death occurs as a consequence of an uncontrolled inflammatory response. VIP also has a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting the production of microglia-derived proinflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, nitric oxide). It prevents neuronal cell death following brain trauma by reducing the inflammatory response of neighboring microglia. VIP is thus a valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of pathologic conditions in the CNS where inflammation-induced neurodegeneration occurs (Delgado and Ganea, 2003). TRH induced neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but little or none in the other ALS patients or in patients with other neurological diseases (Congia et al., 1991).",

The cleavage specificities of PTP for cleavage between and at the NH2-terminal side of the dibasic residue sites indicate that resultant peptide intermediates possess basic residue extensions at their NH2-termini (Loh et al., 1985; Azaryan and Hook, 1994a, b; Azaryan et al., 1995a). Studies of PE-derived peptides demonstrate the presence of enkephalin peptides with basic residue extensions at their NH2-termini (Hook and Eiden, 1984; Kreiger et al., 1992). These results indicate the necessity for an aminopeptidase that removes Arg and Lys residues from NH2-termini of peptide intermediates as one of the later steps in PE processing.",

Production of Met-Enk by cathepsin L occurred by proteolytic processing at dibasic and monobasic prohormone-processing sites. Co-localization of cathepsin L with Met-Enk in secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine chromaffin cells was shown by immunofluorescent confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. Cathepsin L was co-secreted with Met-Enk. In cathepsin L-gene-knockout mice, significant reduction in Met-Enk levels in brain occurred with an increase in the relative amounts of enkephalin precursor (Yasothornsrikul et al., 2003).",

Inhibition of NEP by thiorphan (Patey et al., 1981) induces analgesia (Llorens et al., 1980), but it has been controversial whether it is neuronal (Horsthemke et al., 1983; Barnes et al., 1988). NEP 24.11 is a cell-surface zinc metallopeptidase with specificity directed toward the hydrolysis of peptide bonds at the N-terminal side of amino acids of hydrophobic residues: Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Trp (Turner and Barnes, 1995; Hooper and Turner, 1988). NEP 24.11 is sensitive to the chelating agents EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. It is highly susceptible to phosphoramidon (K\ni = 2 nM) and thiorphan. The enzyme is distributed widely and in the CNS serves to inactivate enkephalins, tachykinins, and somatostatin (Turner et al., 1996). In vitro, the enzyme hydrolyzes neutrophil chemotactic peptide, atrial natriuretic peptides, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. NEP 24.11 was found to be co-localized on the plasma membrane of substance P-rich boutons in the substantia nigra, suggesting its probable role as a neuropeptidase (Turner et al., 2001). Molecular cloning of NEP 24.11 revealed its identity with the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CD10) (Howell et al., 1991), implying its primary role in the immune system.

It hydrolyzes a range of peptides including opioid peptides, neurotensin, bombesin, tachykinins, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (Chai and Mendelsohn, 1995). ACE is a membrane-bound ectoenzyme of 146 kDa that consists of a large extracellular domain with a transmembrane anchor and a small intracellular carboxyl terminus (Soubrier et al., 1988). Its extracellular domain contains two regions of high sequence homology, each containing an active site sequence. Although the two sites are catalytically active, the C-terminal one is more responsible for most of the hydrolysis of angiotensin I and for the binding of inhibitors (Wei et al., 1991; Perich et al., 1992). The N-terminal site has structural constraints that limit the binding of some substrates and drugs (Wei et al., 1992). In human beings, ACE has two forms and two functions. Testicular ACE (tACE) has only one active site and has a sequence identical to the C terminus of the somatic ACE. Somatic ACE exists in most cells, and tACE, which is half the size of somatic ACE, is found only in the testis (Ehlers and Riordan, 1991; Perich et al., 1992).",

Sequence data has shown its strong homology to CD13, a 150-kDa cell-surface glycoprotein (Look et al., 1989; Razak and Newland, 1992). Its nucleotide sequence predicts a 967-amino-acid integral membrane protein with a single, 24-amino-acid hydrophobic segment near the amino terminus. Amino-terminal protein sequence analysis of CD13 molecules indicated that the hydrophobic segment is not cleaved, but rather serves both as a signal for membrane insertion and as a stable membrane-spanning segment. The remainder of the molecule consists of a large extracellular carboxy-terminal domain, which contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence characteristic of members of the zinc-binding metalloprotease superfamily. APN, a membrane-bound glycoprotein, is involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides by diverse cell types, including small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and synaptic membranes prepared from cells of the CNS (Look et al., 1989).",

Aminopeptidases may play an important role in the processes of tolerance and withdrawal associated with morphine administration. Increased activity of PSA was found in the brain cortex of heroin addicts in humans (Larrinaga et al., 2005). In rats treated with morphine, the activity of soluble PSA was found to be higher in the frontal cortex (Irazusta et al., 2003). In contrast, rats experiencing withdrawal symptoms presented decreased levels of aminopeptidase activity in certain brain areas. The activity of APN in the hippocampus and soluble PSA in the frontal cortex were lower in rats experiencing naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms. However, the activity of the aminopeptidases in vitro was unaltered by incubation with morphine, suggesting an indirect action of this opioid upon the aminopeptidases.",

Another mixed inhibitor, phelorphan, affects the morphine withdrawal syndrome (Van Amsterdam et al., 1987). SCH-34826, an orally active NEP inhibitor that produces analgesia in mice, does not alter gastrointestinal movement or respiratory function (Chipkin et al., 1988). In addition, it is inactive in tests measuring potential antianxiety, antidepression, and antipsychotic effects demonstrating that the inhibitors have more specific pharmacological effects than the opiates. Since the enkephalinergic pathway of analgesia is unique, it is feasible that the NAP inhibitor may be a non-addictive analgesic without psychotropic side effects.",

The reversible carbaphethiol, a parenterally active form of phethiol, was also developed. The structural features necessary for interaction of mercaptoamines with aminopeptidases are specific. Aminopeptidases contain subsites that contribute to specific substrate binding: the \u201cR\u201d group of the N-terminal amino acid and the \u201cR\u2032 \u201d group of the peptide chain (Bryce and Rabin, 1964; Van Amsterdam et al., 1987). Irreversible inhibitors resistant to metabolic inactivation are of greater value for in vivo studies. Diazomethyl ketone, which specifically attacks the active site cysteine residue (Fujiwara et al., 1982), has been shown to be an extraordinarily potent inhibitor of pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (Wilk et al., 1985). It is highly effective in in vivo studies and has low toxicity. By substituting the functional groups of these synthetic compounds, potent and selective inhibitors for ENK inactivation may become available.",

The discovery of phosphoramidon as a NEP inhibitor has been very helpful in developing novel inhibitors (Kenny, 1977). It is of interest that all the above-mentioned synthetic and natural inhibitors are modified peptides (Umezawa, 1972; Umezawa and Aoyagi, 1977). Recently one of the most potent ACE inhibitors, designated converstatin, was characterized to be a tryptic fragment of a plasma protein with a K\ni value in the picomolar range (Okuda and Arakawa, 1985). Peptide inhibitors for enkephalinases would be superior because of their non-toxicity (Rapaka, 1986). They can be metabolized to amino acids that do not cause liver and kidney damage as the opiates do. These inhibitors of cerebral peptidases cannot cross the placental barrier, which is an additional advantage for their use as analgesics for pregnant women.",

The blood-borne Enks indicate that some peptide receptors are distant from the synapses. During their travel, attack by peptidases is unavoidable. Recent findings indicate that the pharmacological effects of puromycin, bestatin, and thiorphan are due to their protection of Enk from destruction before its receptor binding and their inhibition of the postsynaptic peptidases (Graf et al., 1982). Bestatin and thiorphan increase the release of Enk by K+ stimulation (Patey et al., 1981) indicating that peptidase inhibitors play a major regulatory role in the process.",

The presynaptic regulation allows the neurons to store releasable peptide that is relatively independent of axoplasmic transport. It is believed that Enks and neurotransmitters alike are constantly released at basal levels, which increase with stimulation. They are continuously produced at a high level and are degraded after production, with degradation being inhibited during stimulation of release. The inhibitor is released together with Enks into the synaptic cleft. Indeed, Enk is co-released with the peptide (Winkler et al., 1987). A NAP inhibitor is released in rat hippocampal slices by electric stimulation. The enzyme is found to be sensitive to a small-peptide soluble fraction extracted from bovine brains (Hui and Hui, unpublished observations).",

Second, inhibitors may potentiate Enk biological actions, and thereby contribute to the delineation of their functional roles. In addition, it will provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of peptide neurotransmission in the living brain that will lead to the development of novel inhibitors that are innovative analgesics without the unwanted side effects experienced with narcotics.",

Abnormalities of neuropeptidases have been found in numerous mental, degenerative, and neurological diseases. Opioid peptide enkephalin, the most well studied neuropeptides is synthesized with a group of peptidases acting in an orderly sequence. In contrast, the inactivation of enkephalin is likely to be controlled by a single peptidase\u2014NAP. Study of the neuropeptidases will broaden our knowledge on how the nervous system functions. That will ultimately lead to the development of better diagnosis and treatment, targeted at the gene or enzyme level, in mental and neurological diseases.
