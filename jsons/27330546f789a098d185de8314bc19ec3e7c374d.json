The existing IBVs continue to evolve in various geographic areas in Asia, which results in the recombination and co-circulation between IBV types. This makes it increasingly difficult to prevent and control IBV infections, despite routine vaccination. Some ACoVs have also been identified in other avian species and they may pose a threat of cross-transmission to commercial sectors. The present review provides an overview of IBV circulation and the dynamic emergence of new variants found throughout Asia via the recombination of IBV strains. In addition to commercial poultry, backyard poultry and free-ranging birds may serve as a 'hub' for ACoV transmission within a particular area. These birds may be capable of spreading viruses, either to areas of close proximity, or to remote places via migration and trade.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to be one of the major respiratory pathogens that cause a range of diseases in both human and animal communities. Some have led to concerns for a threat to global public health in the twenty-first century, such as the CoVs causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Zhong et al. 2003) and those responsible for the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Zaki et al. 2012) . For CoVs in avian species, avian coronaviruses (ACoVs) are classified into the genus Gammacoronavirus. The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is among the most important ACoVs affecting the poultry industry. IBV was first reported as an avian respiratory pathogen in the 1930s in Massachusetts, USA. It exhibits extensive antigenic variation, and the strains present in each country are almost unique. Therefore, many genotypes of IBV have been identified worldwide, and new variants keep emerging despite vaccination (reviewed in de Wit et al. 2011; Jackwood 2012) . Vaccines against IBVs are generally effective, but new strains continue to emerge causing clinical diseases and production problems in vaccinated flocks, eventually having an economic impact on the global poultry industry Liu et al. 2006a Liu et al. , 2006b Han et al. 2011) . The pathogenicity of IBV is very complex as it is influenced by many factors, such as the strain of the virus, the breed of chicken, environmental conditions, and concurrent infection from other pathogens. IBV alone may not cause severe and devastating disease, but IBV-infected birds can be susceptible to superinfection by bacteria (for example, Escherichia coli), mycoplasma (for example, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, M. synoviae) and co-infection with other viruses such as the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), and Marek's disease virus (MDV) (Bradbury 1984; Matthijs et al. 2003; Cavanagh & Gelb 2008; Dwars et al. 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 322, "text": "(Zhong et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 413, "end": 431, "text": "(Zaki et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 964, "end": 983, "text": "de Wit et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 984, "end": 998, "text": "Jackwood 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1239, "text": "Liu et al. 2006a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1258, "text": "Liu et al. , 2006b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1275, "text": "Han et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1904, "text": "(Bradbury 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1926, "text": "Matthijs et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1948, "text": "Cavanagh & Gelb 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1966, "text": "Dwars et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "IBV consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome.

This genotyping is very useful in the continuous determination of the epidemic genotype of IBV field strains, and for predicting the effectiveness of vaccines against field isolates.

This includes country of origin, name and genetic types of the isolates, tissue tropism, common breeds, and age range of IBVinfected birds. GenBank accession numbers are included that can document the reference citation of each representative strain. Figure 1 illustrates the phylogenetic tree indicating the relationship between the S1 amino acid sequences of the selected strains obtained from the Asian IBV isolates listed in Table 1 , and a 4/91 strain, have been used extensively in poultry farms for many years. However, these vaccines provided very little protection against Chinese isolates. This is because vaccines and field strains belong to different phylogenetic clusters that have larger evolutionary distances, indicating different genotypes (Liu et al. 2006a (Liu et al. , 2006b Han et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2012 ). The obvious signs of IB in vaccinated commercial broilers were respiratory symptoms. Post-mortem findings indicated inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, the kidneys, and the proventriculus. There was a broad range of debilitating symptoms while mortality sometimes occurred when co-infection was present. The most prevalent signs in layer hens included decreased egg production, deformed eggs, and increased mortality. A nephropathogenic LX4 type, one among the predominant Chinese variants, was purported to have originated in China in the mid-1980s. Importantly, a predominant QX-IBV, a new IBV variant that was classified within the LX4 group, was reported (Yudong et al. 1998 ) and spread extensively to other regions in China and also to other countries (reviewed in de Wit et al. 2011; Jackwood 2012; Ma et al. 2012 ). This type of IBV caused severe nephritis, proventricultis, and atrophic oviducts, which resulted in a decrease in egg production (Yudong et al. 1998) . In previous years, outbreaks of many IBV strains, such as the Mass-type associated nephropathogenic strains, were reported in China. Nevertheless, other strains with a partial relationship to the Mass-type were also identified (Li & Yang 2001; Yu et al. 2001; Bing et al. 2007 ). In addition, virus isolation between 1995 and 2004 indicated that at least seven genotypes were detected, mainly being nephropathogenic strains. However, a number of genotypes were not only indigenous to China, but some had a genetic relationship to those isolated from neighboring countries, for example, Korea and Taiwan (Liu et al. 2006a (Liu et al. , 2006b . Also the major groups of the more recently isolated IBVs belonged to the Chinese types, which differed from both the vaccine and the non-Chinese strains . Therefore, different IBV strains have been increasingly co-circulating in the poultry population. The geographic distribution of IBVs indicated a wide variety of IBV types present in China. For instance, in southern China, the dominant signs of IB were associated with respiratory distress and nephritis in chickens of different age groups. Some isolates were classified into Taiwanese-type (TW-I), Mass-type, and proventriculitis-type viruses (Li et al. 2010; Zou et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013 ). In addition, IBVs isolated from broilers and broiler breeders at various ages from eastern, southern, south-western, and central parts of China were classified into different genetic groups. These flocks exhibited typical respiratory and nephropathogenic IB symptoms, and experienced pathological changes. Nephropathogenic IBVs were mainly A2like (QX-IBV) strains, and they showed evolutionary distance from vaccine strains. Among others, HN08, 4/91, Gray, and Mass-types were also identified. Moreover, recombination events were observed between a LX4 and a teal-isolate (tl/CH/LDT3/03I-type), contributing to the emergence of a new variant. Interestingly, a recent Taiwanese-type (TW-II) was also detected in Mainland China. Corresponding investigations were presented, indicating that the Chinese strains had also been isolated in Taiwan (Han et al. 2011; Ji et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013) . Predominantly nephropathogenic LX4-type IBVs had apparently replaced the previously prevalent IBVs in China (Li et al. 2013) . Recently, the divergence of new IBV variants that could be further classified was also demonstrated. For instance, IBV isolates in Cluster I and Cluster II had dissimilar amino acid sequences at a different position in the S1 subunit . Moreover, a GX-NN09032 isolate was associated with a recombination found in four IBV strains (He et al. 2012) , while YN-type IBV was genetically similar to most of the prevalent Chinese strains but displayed more severe pathogenicity than the previously reported IBVs (Feng et al. 2012) . Another example showed that a CK/CH/LSL/99I-type isolate was recently predominant in southern China. The S1 gene of this isolate had the greatest diversity. Positive selections were detected, not only in the S1 gene but also in the M and N genes. Recombination with vaccine strains, in particular a 4/91-type, was also detected (Mo et al. Figure 1 .

Therefore, the trend of IBV local strains isolated in different Chinese regions continually changes as novel variants are discovered. Consecutive investigations over a 15-year period have so far identified at least nine genetic types and, according to sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the S1 gene (Table 1) , a couple of IBV variants currently found in China. Thus, it is now clear that various IBV field variants are co-circulating in China and appear to continually evolve. Vaccine strains might have an important role in the appearance of new IBV variants via recombination. In addition, IBV evolution is driven by the generation of both genetic diversity and selection. For the effective control of IB, alternative vaccines rather than common Mass-type vaccines are needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 309, "end": 318, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The first IBV (TP/64) appeared in Taiwan in 1965, and was isolated from layers that suffered from respiratory distress and a drop in egg production (Tseng et al. 1996) . IB outbreaks occurred frequently even though a vaccination program was widely used. The most common vaccine used in Taiwan was based on a Masstype. The S1 phylogeny of the Taiwanese isolates demonstrated the following groups: a Taiwanese Group I (TW-I), a Taiwanese Group II (TW-II), a Chinese-type, and a Mass-type. For the indigenous groups, the first Taiwanese isolate was classified as TW-II. However, according to the results of recent studies, most of these isolates belonged to TW-I. In addition, some of the remaining isolates appeared to be vaccine strains, including a Mass-type IBV field strain and one belonging to a Chinese J2 strain. The existence of Chinese IBV in Taiwan was unusual because of the prohibited importation of poultry products between Taiwan and Mainland China (Huang et al. 2004 ). Later, Huang and Wang (2006) developed attenuated vaccines derived from Taiwanese IBVs by the passage of the viruses in embryonated eggs. Thereafter, they demonstrated that the attenuation of these IBVs resulted in substitutions between two and six amino acids found in the S1 gene, and a few amino acid substitutions found in the S2 subunit (Huang & Wang 2007) . This indicated that the S1 gene had undergone a high degree of mutation. Furthermore, Chen et al. (2009) studied the evidence of an IBV isolated in 2002, which demonstrated that the recombinants of Taiwanese IBVs had chimeric IBV genome arrangements originating from parental strains similar to those of Taiwan and China. Chen et al. (2010) further indicated that one isolate showed evidence of frequent recombination with the China-like strain in the S gene. Another isolate demonstrated the genome organization of the China-like strain in the S2 gene, and the H120-like genome fragments within the M protein gene.

(2004) demonstrated a new Japanese IBV subtype, which had a S1 sequence most similar to those of Australian strains, while the N sequence was closely related to those of North American strains. This new Japanese variant might have recombined with Australian-related and North American-related IBVs. Shimazaki et al. (2008) subsequently described a new virulent 4/91 variant. These viruses caused severe respiratory symptoms and weight loss in young chicks. The S1 analysis indicated that the isolates were closely related to Spanish and French isolates, suggesting that the 4/91 variants were derived from a foreign field isolate. In addition, some IBV strains had high sequence similarity with that of a 4/91 vaccine strain commonly used in Japan, suggesting that vaccine-like viruses were derived from a vaccine (Shimazaki et al. 2009 ). Earlier, in 2002, Japan had introduced the 4/91 IBV vaccine, and was trading a large amount of poultry products from European countries. The introduction of the vaccine, and the trading of poultry products, might have provided the transmission routes for those strains (Mase et al. 2008 ). Subsequently, Mase et al. (2010) reported a novel genotype isolated in 2009, designated as JP-IV. This variant was isolated from commercial layers unable to start laying eggs. Neither respiratory form of IB nor increased mortality was observed.

Three clusters were differentiated into non-Korean strains, including Arkansas (Ark), Conn, and Mass types, whereas the rest of the IBV strains, such as a KM91, were unique to Korea ). In the beginning, a Mass-type IBV was the only vaccine strain used in Korea (King 1988) . But, at a later date, vaccine strains based on a Mass, a H120, and a KM91 were also implemented to control IB. The common Korean IBV, isolated between 2001 and 2003 from broilers and broiler breeders, was classified as KM91 and Ark-type isolates (Jang et al. 2007 ). Later, Lee et al. (2008) studied the genetic groups of IBVs obtained from 2003 to 2006, which indicated that the unique Korean (K-I) group could be further divided into the respiratory subgroups K-Ia and K-Ib. Furthermore, the K-II group was closely related to nephropathogenic variants isolated from China and Japan, while the K-III group was closely related to the enteric IBV isolated from China that caused proventriculitis. From these results, K-Ia and K-II were the most prevalent strains. Recently, it was shown that the new clusters of Korean IBVs had recombination events of the S1 gene with putative parental strains originating from KM91-like or QX-like subgroups (Lim et al. 2011 ). More recently, Mo et al. (2013) identified an IBV circulation in Korea from the isolates from 1990 to 2011.

(2013) also declared the recombination of Korean IBV to be between an indigenous Korean-type and Mass-type vaccines currently used in Korea (such as Ma5, H52, and H120 vaccines). Likewise, a recombination was also predicted between the following: (1) New Cluster 1 and QX-like, (2) K-I and H120, and (3) KM91 and QX-like. In conclusion, the currently circulating Korean IBVs appear to be a respiratory strain K-I, a nephropathogenic strain K-II with subgroups KM91-like and QX-like, an enteric strain, and some other recent strains (for example, K-III, New Cluster 1, and New Cluster 2).

Genetically, the recently isolated Thai IBVs were characterized and found to be similar to the QX-like strain, and the indigenous strain was identified according to the HVR of the S1 gene (Pohuang et al. 2009 ). Most of the isolates were from H120-vaccinated commercial broiler flocks raised in central Thailand. These flocks suffered from airway problems. Pohuang et al. (2011) isolated and identified the viruses based on a full-length S1 gene analysis. The viruses were, therefore, classified into the following groups: a group unique to Thailand Group I, a QX-like Group II, and a Mass-type Group III. This study also showed the recombination events of the local isolates. The viruses in Group I had 5 0 -terminus of the THA001 origin isolated in Thailand in the late 1990s, while the 3 0 -terminus belonged to the QX-like Group II. In addition, the viruses in Group II shared the S1 sequence of the Chinese QX-IBV, but the rest of the sequence belonged to the Chinese strain JX/99/01.

The Iranian 4/91 isolates were thus unlikely to cause mortality, severe clinical signs, or gross lesions in infected poultry.

The purpose of backyard poultry farming in rural areas is either small-scale production or a non-commercial operation (free-ranging domesticated birds). Traditional poultry trading is often conducted daily or weekly. Therefore, flocks may get infected by vehicles or equipment and tools shared between farms. Egg collection, transport, and trading activities among poultry farms can spread the disease to other flocks ( Figure 2 ). For instance, in Cambodia, poultry being moved to live bird markets via poultry traders was a potential 'hub' for the spread of HPAI H5N1 (van Kerkhove et al. 2009 ). In Vietnam, the route from poultry traders to live bird markets was the key to HPAI H5N1 transmission (Soares-Magalhaes 2010). Furthermore, study on poultry market chains in China demonstrated that H5N1-infected live poultry markets presented a more significant problem than non-infected markets (Martin 2011) . In Thailand, although the number of poultry traded in traditional networks is small compared with other production systems, poultry trading continues all year round, and may thus surreptitiously contribute to the spread of any disease. Live backyard poultry trading is usually based on the activities of traders who buy chickens from villages and supply urban markets with poultry meat products. In addition, trade always flows from live poultry to slaughterhouses (Choprakarn & Wongpichet 2007) . studied the movement and trading patterns of backyard poultry in Thailand. With regard to the spread of H5N1 to the backyard farming area, they found that the pattern of disease transmission was local spreading outwardly. They also indicated a close relationship between owners' houses and fresh food markets. This relationship needs the attention of authorities to prevent future outbreaks. At the same time, Poolkhet, Chairatanayuth, Thongratsakul, Yatbantoong, et al. (2013) specified that the important factors in the spread of avian flu in backyard farming systems are the farmers themselves, neighbors with backyard poultry, and visitors to sport arenas or training fields of fighting poultry. Moreover, Wiratsudakul et al. (2014) studied the dynamics of backyard poultry flows in traditional trade networks. Flows of backyard poultry trade indicated that traders ran businesses only near their villages. The average distance of poultry movement ranged from 4 to 25 kilometers, determining a spatial scale for the risk of H5N1 transmission to be spread through the traditional poultry market. As a result, overlapping poultry supply zones might also enable disease transmission over extensive distances through Although the above studies were particularly focused on HPAI H5N1 transmission in backyard poultry, this information might be of use to serve as a model for other respiratory infectious disease surveillance and control programs. It is applicable for the control and prevention of avian coronavirus-associated diseases in backyard poultry due to the same mode and route of transmission (OIE 2012) .
