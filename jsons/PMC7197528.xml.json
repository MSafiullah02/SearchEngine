This ushered in a transformation of the core clinical curriculum to a remote, online platform for students of all years. Institutional policies also mandated a halt of basic and translational science research in laboratories for experiments considered \u201cnonessential.\u201d Virtual clinical electives within different medical specialties became available for students currently in their clerkship year to participate in the care of COVID-19 patients and remain clinically engaged. These were coupled with independent research electives for students already working on clinical research projects with faculty mentors.",

In response, many postclerkship, third-year medical students currently conducting wet-lab research have had to modify their projects or adapt entirely new ones that can be completed remotely. Additionally, the curricular changes created uncertainty for first-year students surrounding neurosurgical research opportunities for the summer between first and second years. These restrictions might act to halt the momentum that students might otherwise be able to build early on in their academic careers. Alternatively, an increasing number of students might feel pressured to undertake a research year to make up for the lost opportunities during these times. If such is the case, a potentially disrupting rise in the number of residency applications may follow in next year's residency application cycle.",

Hence, those without an existing IRB approval might feel more inclined to pursue projects that can proceed without such approval, such as meta-analyses and literature review.",
