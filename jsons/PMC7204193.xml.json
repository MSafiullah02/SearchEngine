This immediate burst of cases and their health data have created a vital source of information and knowledge. There is an immediate requirement to store such a large amount of data of these cases, using different data storage technologies. These data are used to undertake research and development about the virus, pandemic and measures to fight this virus and its after-effects. Big data is an innovative technology which can digitally store a large amount of data of these patients. It helps to computationally analyse to reveal patterns, trends, associations and differences. It can also help in revealing the insights into the spread and control of this virus. With detailed data capturing capability, big data can be used gainfully to minimise the risk of spreading this virus [1, 2].",

Prevalent modelled data helps in understanding and offering an edge over the other process like corresponding homology models predicted by fold and function assignment system server for each target protein were downloaded from Protein Data Bank, for predicting the COVID-19 cure and identifying the symptoms associated with it [7, 8]. Big data provides the insights and analyses with the factors leading to better containment of the infected persons. China suppressed the COVID-19 with the help of data collection and implementing it with AI leading towards a low rate of spread. There are several big data components to this pandemic where AI can play a significant role like in biomedical research, natural language processing, social media, and mining the scientific literature.",
