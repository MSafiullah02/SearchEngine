Over the past two decades, researchers have developed and tested thousands of antiviral compounds with varying efficacies and toxicity profiles that have ultimately lead to the FDA approval of powerful combination therapies (Lawitz et al., 2013; Scheel and Rice, 2013). Several different direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that target the NS3/4A protease, NS5A phosphoprotein, or NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HCV have been approved for use in the clinic (Afdhal et al., 2014; Dhaliwal and Nampoothiri, 2014; Manns and von Hahn, 2013; Younossi et al., 2015). Ideally, the knowledge gained in developing HCV antivirals that are effective and not prone to the outgrowth of drug resistance will be applied to other viruses as well.",

            "text": "The emergence of drug-resistant variants follows basic evolutionary principles, requiring spontaneous mutations as well as selective pressure, so that beneficial mutations increase the progeny size of genomes that bear them. The genetic diversity in RNA viral genomes results from the high error frequencies incurred by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which occur at approximately 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 errors for each nucleotide synthesized (Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010). Given the iterative copying of positive and negative strands, much higher cumulative error frequencies are observed, even during a single cycle of infection (Sanju\u00e1n et al., 2010; Acevedo et al., 2014). When more than one mutation is required to confer drug resistance, the outgrowth of drug resistance can be delayed (Bloom et al., 2010). As a result, treatment with combinations of drugs can be extremely effective at suppressing drug resistance, because the number of mutations required for resistance to multiple drugs is ideally the sum of the number of mutations needed for each drug alone. Combination therapies have proven invaluable in reducing the frequency of drug resistance in both microbiology and oncology (Fillat et al., 2014; Falade-Nwulia et al., 2017; Kerantzas and Jacobs, 2017).",

Examples of antivirals for which resistance comes with a high fitness cost include integrase inhibitors of HIV (Mespl\u00e8de et al., 2015), protease inhibitors of coronaviruses (Deng et al., 2014) and certain nucleoside inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase (Lawitz et al., 2013). As was first shown for 2\u2019-C-methyl CTP, selected drug-resistant HCV variants grow poorly and retain their low fitness upon passage (Dutartre et al., 2006). Sofosbuvir, the FDA-approved NS5B polymerase inhibitor, has dramatically increased the efficacy of HCV treatment, and also generates little outgrowth of resistant variants. The few HCV variants observed in patients are nearly inviable (Svarovskaia et al., 2016). Understanding the mechanisms by which this kind of fitness cost is enforced would greatly facilitate future antiviral design.",

            "text": "Another approach to decrease the selection of drug-resistant variants is termed dominant drug targeting. This applies to antiviral targets for which the drug-bound products of pre-existing drug-susceptible genomes are dominant-negative inhibitors of new drug-resistant progeny (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005; Tanner et al., 2014; Mateo et al., 2015). Recently, this has been demonstrated for the capsid proteins of poliovirus and dengue virus (Tanner et al., 2014; Mateo et al., 2015), but other potential dominant drug targets have also been identified (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2004). When a drug-resistant genome is in its cell of origin, it coexists with its drug-susceptible parents and siblings. If the drug target is, for example, a subunit of an oligomeric complex and subunits from different genomes have the opportunity to mix, chimeric oligomers often form. At the time of its creation, the drug-resistant genome will be a minority species, and such chimeras would be predominantly composed of the drug-bound, susceptible components thus incapacitating the entire oligomeric structure. Such \u2018phenotypic masking\u2019 was originally invoked to explain the very low frequency of foot-and-mouth-disease escape variants following selection with neutralizing antibodies when passaged at high multiplicities of infection (MOIs)(Holland et al., 1989).",

We used differential hybridization of RNA probes to detect two different genomic RNAs in a single cell by confocal microscopy and by flow cytometry.

A recently developed branched DNA probe technology allows the generation of sufficiently sensitive RNA probes to identify single molecules within cells, but requires approximately 1000 nucleotides of differential probe hybridization to achieve specificity (Affymetrix Inc, 2016). To create a viral strain with this extreme dissimilarity from wild-type virus, we tested the viability of three different codon-altered versions of the JFH1 variant of HCV (Figure 1B). Each mutated version contained 200\u2013300 nucleotide changes that did not alter the protein sequence (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133). Of these codon-altered (CA) variants, CA-1 was inviable, CA-2 showed reduced viral protein accumulation, and CA-3 showed accumulation of both viral protein and RNA to abundances equivalent to those of the wild-type virus (Figure 1C). Recently, detailed analysis of covarying nucleotides within the HCV coding region has identified the location of several previously unknown functional RNA secondary structures (Pirakitikulr et al., 2016). Interestingly, CA-1 contains two such regions and CA-2 contains one, which correlates with decreasing viability, while CA-3 contains no such regions (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133)(Pirakitikulr et al., 2016). Thus, subsequent experiments were performed only with CA-3. This variant, now termed \u2018CA\u2019 virus, contains 247 synonymous mutations over a 918-nucleotide region that spans the coding sequences for most of NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3 (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3).",

We resolved cells transfected with WT vRNA (Figure 2Di), transfected with CA vRNA (ii), a mixture of these two cell types (iii) and cells co-transfected with both WT and CA vRNAs (iv).

In the absence of a drug, all viral populations should be present. However, in the presence of a drug, three outcomes are possible depending on the genetic outcome within the R + S population. If drug resistance were trans-dominant (Figure 3E), the drug-resistant virus would rescue the drug-susceptible genomes and all viruses in R + S cells would survive in the presence of the drug. S cells would drop into the U population, and R cells would survive. If drug resistance were cis-dominant (Figure 3F), only the R viruses in the R + S cells would survive, because the drug-resistant proteins would be unable to rescue the S viruses in the same cell. Consequently, the R + S cells would drop into the R population. If drug susceptibility were dominant (Figure 3G), all viruses in the R + S cells would be cleared, and the R + S cells, like the S cells, would drop into the U population, and only the R cells would continue to replicate.",

Cells were infected for 72 hr at MOIs such that all four populations were represented, followed by 36 hr of continued incubation in the absence or presence of 2 \u03bcM BILN-2061. Cells were then harvested, fixed, co-stained with wild-type and codon-altered RNA probe sets and analyzed by flow cytometry. All four cell types appeared in the absence of BILN-2061 (Figure 3H,I). In the BILN-2061-treated samples (Figure 3J,K), the susceptible S population shifted to the U cells as expected. The S + R cells, on the other hand, shifted to the R population upon drug treatment. Thus, the drug-resistant viral genomes in the co-infected cells could replicate, but could not rescue the drug-susceptible ones. Data from this and replicate experiments (Figure 3I,K) confirmed the quantitative shift of S + R cells into the R population upon drug treatment. We conclude that, for the NS3/4A target, drug-resistant genomes are cis-dominant for the 1:1 ratio of S and R viruses tested here. We also tested whether over-expressed drug-resistant NS3/4A precursors could rescue BILN-2061-susceptible virus (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B). Salvage of S virus was not observed. Importantly, when cis-acting proteins are drug targets, drug-resistant products will enhance the propagation of only those genomes that encode them, allowing powerful selection for drug resistance.",

To investigate whether a related compound, R1479 (Klumpp et al., 2006), exacted a similar cost to viral fitness to drug-resistant variants, we attempted to recover R1479-resistant viruses for dominance testing. JFH1 was passaged for multiple rounds of infection in the presence of 25 \u03bcM R1479. Several variants in NS5B (A336P, D438G, S282T, F427L, T481A) arose during passage (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3). Each mutation was introduced independently into the JFH1 genome and RNA transfections were performed. The T481A genome was the only variant to show any viral RNA production by 7 or 21 days post-transfection. We noticed that F427L and T481A were always isolated together. To test whether these mutations could together increase viral fitness, JFH1 viruses were generated that contained both mutations. Viruses with the mutations separate or together were passaged extensively in the presence of R1479. Occasional resistant outgrowths were observed, but none conferred sustained growth (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C). Thus, like Sofosbuvir, the poor viability of mutant viruses resistant to R1479 precludes the ability to perform further genetic analysis but provides an excellent paradigm for antiviral development.",

Additionally, the NS5A inhibitors, as a class, display EC50\u2019s in the low picomolar range (Gao, 2013), making them among the most potent antiviral compounds ever identified. Assuming uniform inhibitor concentrations in cells and in medium, it has been estimated that only a small fraction of NS5A molecules should be bound to drugs under inhibitory conditions (Sun et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016). Thus, it seemed mechanistically likely that drug-bound NS5A proteins from drug-susceptible viruses could be dominant inhibitors of NS5A encoded by newly arising drug-resistant ones. However, NS5A inhibitors have generally demonstrated low barriers to resistance in patients. Our goal was gain mechanistic insight into this dichotomy.",

Huh-7.5.1 cells were coinfected with CA and WT-Y93N viruses for 72 hr (Figure 4D). Cells were then treated with DMSO or 500nM SR2486 for 24 hr, harvested, fixed, co-stained for WT and CA vRNAs and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the absence of the NS5A inhibitor, all four populations, U, S, R + S and R were observed (Figure 4E,F). In the presence of SR2486, the S population of cells dropped into the U population as expected. As was the case in Figure 3, the co-infected R + S population of cells dropped into the R population. Thus, resistance to NS5A inhibitor SR2486 in the context of viral infection was genetically dominant and the lack of rescue of the S virus with which it was mixedly infected shows that drug resistance is also cis-dominant. HCV infected cells become resistant to superinfection upon expression of non-structural proteins (Schaller et al., 2007; Tscherne et al., 2007). Due to this superinfection exclusion, it is likely that all coinfected cells arise through nearly synchronous infection throughout the course of the experiment. To control for any effects on selection that may occur due to the differential timing of coinfections that occurs over the initial 72 hr incubation period, we performed the same experiment with higher titer virus and a single cycle of infection in the absence of drug. Huh7.5.1 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 focus-forming unit (FFU)/cell with CA and WT-Y93N viruses and incubated for only 24 hr before drug treatment. Cells were then incubated in the absence and presence of 500nM SR2486 for an additional 24 hr. In this case, we also observe cis-dominance of drug resistant WT-Y93N genomes, indicating that asynchronous coinfection has no effect on selection (Figure 4G). Finally, the cis-dominance of Daclatasvir-resistant WT-Y93H was observed when coinfected with drug susceptible virus (S) in the absence and presence of Daclatasvir (Figure 4H). We conclude that NS5A, despite being an oligomeric species is not a dominant drug target. Instead, genomes resistant to NS5A remain drug resistant in co-infected cells but do not rescue drug-susceptible viruses present in the same cell. This is consistent with the observed outgrowth of viruses that are resistant to NS5A both in cultured cells and in patients, and with an earlier report that at least some functions of NS5A act exclusively in cis (Fridell et al., 2011).",

As previously demonstrated, two different NS5As expressed from the same RNA can associate, while NS5A molecules expressed from different constructs could not (Berger et al., 2014). We were curious whether the dominance phenotypes were altered if we forced NS5A alleles to mix. To test whether exogenously expressed drug-susceptible NS5A proteins could co-assemble with drug-resistant NS5A, we utilized the previously described HCV plasmid that expresses HA-tagged and GFP-tagged NS5A within the same polyprotein but does not support genome replication (Figure 5A). Constructs that contained all combinations of drug-susceptible NS5A (S) and the drug-resistant Y93N variant (R) were created. Upon transfection, all tagged proteins were expressed and can be observed in Figure 5 (Input, Panels B,C). Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies revealed that the GFP-tagged and HA-tagged NS5A proteins were present in the same complexes in the presence or absence of SR2486. Therefore, as has been shown previously, mixed oligomers can form upon co-expression within the same polyprotein (Berger et al., 2014). Furthermore, these interactions are not disrupted by drug treatment or by drug-resistant mutations (Figure 5B,C).",

All S and R combinations of NS5A co-localized at discrete membrane-associated complexes characteristic of HCV infection in the absence of drug (Figure 5D, top panel). However, in the presence of SR2486, membrane-associated complex formation was inhibited in R:S and S:S expressing cells and observed only in R:R expressing cells (Figure 5D, bottom panel). The dispersal of NS5A signal upon drug treatment in the presence of S protein makes NS5A protein appear less abundant (Figure 5D). However, the immunoblots demonstrate that no such decrease in expression occurs as we observe equal levels of NS5A protein independent of allele or the presence of drug (Figure 5B,C). One hallmark of HCV infection is the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (Miyanari et al., 2007; Romero-Brey et al., 2012). Electron microscopy performed by high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution, to preserve membrane structure, revealed many lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of cells expressing S:S, R:R and S:R combinations of NS5As in the absence of inhibitor (Figure 5E,F). However, in the presence of SR2486, only the R:R cells displayed the accumulation of lipid droplets (Figure 5E,G). Therefore, using both assays, the presence of drug-susceptible NS5A prevented drug-resistant phenotypes from being displayed, and thus drug-susceptibility was genetically dominant. This confirmed our original hypothesis that NS5A had the potential to be a dominant drug target.",

We hypothesized that HCV genomes co-infecting the same cell might be physically isolated from each other. To test this possibility, confocal microscopy was used to identify and localize negative vRNA strands in genome-specific RNA replication complexes (Figure 6A). The majority of negative strands of the two different viruses were found to be discrete. Identification and quantification the vRNA puncta in coinfected cells was determined computationally using Volocity software. This program determined the number of negative strand puncta per cell per strain and quantified how many puncta overlapped (Figure 6B). This value was low even for the positive stranded vRNAs, which are present in the cytoplasm at much higher frequencies (Figure 6A,B).",

This has led to abandoned usage and development of many otherwise promising antivirals. To decrease the frequency with which drug-resistant variants arise, combinations of antivirals that, individually, exhibit low barriers to resistance are often used. When drug-resistant variants are first formed intracellularly, through error-prone RNA replication, they arise in a population that includes parental and sibling drug-susceptible viruses. Several genetic relationships between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible genomes are possible. First, the drug resistance of the new variants has the potential to be genetically dominant, and rescue both resistant and susceptible viral genomes. Alternatively, drug resistance can be cis-dominant, with the drug-resistant products rescuing only the genomes that encode them. Finally, the drug-resistant genome can fail to benefit any genomes in the cell because the drug-susceptible products present in the same cell are dominant inhibitors.",

It was soon realized that, both during the growth of HCV replicons in cultured cells and in phase II clinical trials, drug-resistant viruses were generated rapidly (Lin et al., 2004). Nonetheless, in 2011, further advances led to FDA approval of Telaprevir and Boceprevir (Jacobson et al., 2011; Poordad et al., 2011). The anticipation, which proved to be correct, was that inhibitors of NS3/4A would prove useful in combination therapies (Feld et al., 2014; Lawitz et al., 2014). We have used flow cytometry to identify cell populations that are co-infected with HCV that is susceptible or resistant at a 1:1 ratio, to protease inhibitors. Within these cells, the drug-resistant genomes replicated, but the drug-susceptible genomes did not. We therefore conclude that NS3/4A inhibitor resistance is cis-dominant (Figure 3), which should allow the rapid and specific selection for outgrowth from its cell of origin.",

We felt that it was therefore, more likely, that drug-resistant NS3/4A could rescue drug-susceptible virus within the same cell. NS3/4A is not known to assemble into high-order oligomers in the same manner as NS5A, and we therefore did not anticipate drug-susceptible NS3/4A would be trans-dominant. Furthermore, a trans cleavage assay demonstrated that a NS4B-5B polyprotein could be cleaved by NS3/4A supplied in trans (Romero-Brey et al., 2015). However, the trans-cleavage system does not result in membranous web formation that would accompany genome sequestration. Other groups have reported a different result, that defective NS3 mutants cannot be rescued in trans by replicons with functional NS3/4A (Kazakov et al., 2015; Appel et al., 2005). Our interpretation of these studies is that NS3/4A is likely physically able to cleave in trans in cells, but requires access to the alternate precursor proteins in order for this to occur. Therefore, cis-dominance of drug-resistance is likely the result of a lack of free-mixing of NS3/4A encoded by different vRNAs within the same cell.",

This was somewhat surprising, given that NS5A is oligomeric and the NS5A inhibitors are extremely potent, and have been postulated to function at sub-stoichiometric ratios to NS5A protein (Gao, 2013). Indeed, when drug-susceptible and drug-resistant NS5A protein were co-expressed in the present study, hetero-oligomers formed and the biological phenotypes of the drug-susceptible protein were dominant (Figure 5).

Genome-specific RNA probing of co-infected cells revealed that both the negative strands and positive strands from the two viruses were present at physically distinct locations (Figure 6). It is therefore highly probable that membrane-associated proteins such as HCV NS3/4A and NS5A do not mix within individual RNA replication complexes. However, not all mutations in a particular viral product should lead to the same defect with the same genetic properties. For example, we show here that viruses that are defective in a function of NS5A in RNA replication complexes are not rescued and have no effect on the outgrowth of drug-resistant variants. However, NS5A also plays an important role in packaging and assembly of mature HCV particles on lipid droplets (Miyanari et al., 2007; Boson et al., 2017). Lipid droplets are large and form adjacent to RNA replication complexes. In Figure 6E, we have depicted the possibility that NS5A molecules encoded by distinct RNA replication complexes might mix on the surface of these lipid droplets. However, if replication of the drug-susceptible genomes is inhibited, contribution of their encoded proteins to any oligomers on the surface of lipid droplets should be minimal. In this vain, a hypothetical NS5A inhibitor that allowed RNA replication but inhibited the function of NS5A in particle assembly might have different genetic properties than the NS5A inhibitors currently in use.",

Defective capsid proteins of poliovirus, HBV and HIV have been shown to be dominant inhibitors of wild-type viruses (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005; Tanner et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2015; Trono et al., 1989; Pettit et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2009; M\u00fcller et al., 2009; Checkley et al., 2010). Thus, when antiviral targets are capsid proteins, drug susceptibility can be genetically dominant by suppressing the outgrowth of drug-resistant virus within the cell in which it is first generated (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005; Tanner et al., 2014; Kirkegaard et al., 2016). For HCV, very few inhibitors of capsid function have been identified, and their inhibition of viral growth is not sufficiently robust to make genetic experiments possible (Kota et al., 2010). It is therefore not yet possible to test if, as we hypothesize, drug-susceptible virus will prove to be a dominant inhibitor of drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, however, epitope-tagged HCV core protein can form mixed disulfide-bonded core oligomers (Kushima et al., 2010).",

Membrane invaginations house either drug-resistant (red) or drug-susceptible (blue) genomes. In the model, the RNA replication sites are segregated and therefore only the RNA from drug-resistant virus is amplified in the presence of inhibitors of RNA replication.
