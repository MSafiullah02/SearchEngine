However, findings seem to indicate a lower susceptibility of children to COVID-19 and low contagiousness.2 Within 7 days of imposed population quarantine in France (initiated on March 17, 2020), we observed an increase in number of young infants with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.",

However, because little is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants,4, 6 close monitoring is required for at least 2 weeks after the diagnosis.
