            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious disease which, if acquired in pregnancy, can result in significant morbidity and mortality of both pregnant women and their fetus. This may include severe respiratory infection, congenital abnormalities, spontaneous abortion, premature birth, low birth weight and death in both mother and baby (Yuen & Tarrant 2014) . Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections due to their immunosuppressed state; however, evidence suggests that there is a far higher risk of serious sequalae in acquiring influenza, than the currently circulating Novel Corona Virus (COVID 19) , in pregnancy. Current evidence suggests that the risk of COVID 19 in pregnancy appears no higher than in non-pregnant adults (Chen et al., 2020) . However, whilst little is known on this new virus and limited data exists there is some evidence to suggest that acquiring COVID 19 in the third trimester may involve risks (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2020). Morbidity and mortality of pregnant women has been high in influenza epidemics, with evidence suggesting that up to 50% of women of childbearing age who have died in epidemics were pregnant (McHugh et al., 2017) . Additionally, deaths of pregnant women in both Chicago and Minnesota in 1918 and 1957 respectively, were between 20-27% of the affected population (Rasmussen, Jamieson, & Bresee, 2008) . More recently, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in New South Wales, 28% of women admitted to Intensive Care Units were pregnant or immediately postpartum (Australian Influenza Immunization Update, 2009). The United States of America reported 4,693 pregnancy related deaths between 1998 -2005. Of these, 78 women died from influenza or pneumonia. (Callaghan, Chu, & Jamieson, 2010) .",

Western Australian research has reported rates as low as 40% in 2013 (Mak, Regan, Joyce, Gibbs, & Effler, 2015) . A Victorian study reports 39% of pregnant women were vaccinated between July 2015 -June 2017 (Rowe, 2019) . A more recent South Australian study revealed that immunization rates were able to be raised to 76% by utilising a midwifery led immunization program in one hospital (Mohammed, Clarke, Koehler, Watson, & Marshall, 2018) . This poor uptake of the inactivated influenza vaccine is thought to be caused by several factors ranging from: low knowledge and the need for further education amongst health professionals; and women's lack of knowledge in this area (King, Chow, Leask, & Wiley, 2019; Mak et al., 2015; Rowe, 2019) . In Australia several online courses are available to both RN and RM on immunization knowledge and provision and these courses are a way of closing the knowledge gap which exists for some and provides a basis for immunization accreditation in some states (SA Health, 2019a , 2019b .",

This test-retest process was utilised to ensure reliability of the survey. Responders reported no issues with comprehension of the survey. Whilst the second responses varied in some cases from the first, this was thought to be for several reasons. In some cases, completion of the survey may have elicited a desire for more knowledge. In other cases, responders may change their opinions as a result of completing the survey, or they may become tired or bored on the second occasion, resulting in more haphazard responses. All these things contribute to a slight variation in responses. On completion of the test-retest process, Cohens' Kappa coefficient was calculated. Cohens Kappa is a statistical test which assesses consistency of survey results. By comparing both the test and the retest results interrater reliability can be calculated. In this case a score of K=0.804 was obtained which is considered an excellent result, and denotes an acceptable level of agreement, thereby confirming the reliability of the survey (Polit, 2016) .",

The survey included 31 questions incorporating a combination of demographic, influenza disease knowledge and its implication in pregnancy and influenza vaccine knowledge. The final question on the survey sought volunteers for the interview phase of the study. The survey also investigated personal immunization status and midwives' opinions about workplace immunizations. Most significantly the survey explored midwives' understanding of their role in the promotion and provision of antenatal influenza immunization. The survey instrument utilized a five-point Likert scale. Inclusion criteria required that the participants be midwives registered with the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency (AHPRA, 2018). No specific exclusion criteria were applied, to ensure justice by not limiting access to the study.

This form of qualitative research is not prescriptive, rather it is designed for use in an applied field such as nursing or midwifery. It has been described as a methodological framework with a wide range of options that fits well within a mixed methods approach (Thorne, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 collection, coding, and analysis of data. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of midwives and to gain an in depth understanding of the midwifery role. Midwives volunteered to be included in this study via the final question in the survey. Two of the ten midwives taking part in the qualitative study had undergone immunization training and were actively immunizing. Five interviews were conducted face to face and five conducted via telephone subject to personal choice of the interviewees. The mean duration of the interviews was 31 minutes. All interviews were conducted in a time and place nominated by the midwife. The interviews were recorded, and pseudonyms assigned. Interviews continued until data saturation was achieved. This was achieved when no new data was obtained in continuing interviews. contact at a time and place of their choosing. Interviews were conducted by the principal investigator using probing open-ended questions and prompts to focus the answer. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants assumed a pseudonym for the interview and no identifying features were attached to the transcripts. Transcription and coding were conducted by the principal investigator simultaneously around the time of the interview (Polit, 2016; Schneider, 2013) . Once transcriptions were completed and coding performed, a copy of the transcript was forwarded to the participants by mail for the purposes of member checking. Themes were sought from the transcripts using an iterative approach (Schneider, 2013) . Initial thematic analysis was performed by the principal investigator. Thematic analysis treats the data as a mass of information, the analysis which takes place breaks the data down into small but significant pieces. In this study due to the small number of participants, a hands-on approach was adopted in order to gain a thorough understanding of the topic. Once familiar with the data, the principal investigator compiled a list of themes. At this time investigator triangulation was employed to confirm the accuracy of the themes. In this study, data analysis took an inductive approach as the study aim was not to test a theory, but to build new knowledge. The ethical principles of beneficence, dignity and justice were met by ensuring anonymity, access to counselling if required, the right to access their transcripts and the right to withdraw at any time.",

By using a mixed methods approach with a convergent parallel design, the qualitative results have supported and enhanced the quantitative results and through method triangulation this study has achieved a greater understanding of the problem. Up until now the role of midwives has not been fully investigated with no known South Australian study taking place. The midwives in this study all described their role in immunization as one of education and information sharing. However, despite several midwives actively immunizing in a general practise setting and having completed the SA Health Understanding Immunization course, few of the midwives saw their role as immunization provision (SA Health, 2019a) . Those that regularly immunized thought they should be more autonomous in this practise, particularly in an antenatal setting. The South Australian midwives surveyed were significantly more likely to recommend the vaccine (80.9%) than midwives surveyed in Belgium, which found that only 23% recommended the influenza vaccine in pregnancy (Maertens et al., 2016) . Whilst most of the midwives interviewed were confident in providing the influenza vaccine, of those surveyed only 31.9% had given the vaccine in the previous year.",

Lack of knowledge of the risks associated with acquiring influenza in pregnancy places greater importance on the timely education of women. Midwives are well placed to provide this education. However, this study has shown that only 67.5% of RN/RM and 44.7% of RM recognised the benefits provided by the influenza vaccine to the infant in the first year of life (p 0.015). This is a clear knowledge deficit and one with the potential to place mothers and babies at risk. Additionally, there is a significant deviation in knowledge of the benefits of the influenza vaccine to the fetus, with more RN/RM (80.0%) than RM (48.9%) agreeing (p=0.001). This apparent lack of knowledge of immunology suggests that one barrier to immunization provision and promotion is the education provided in undergraduate Bachelor of Midwifery courses. However, this is not supported in international literature where midwifery students appear to have greater knowledge of immunization than their registered counterparts (Desbouys, Grison, Launay, & Loulergue, 2016) .",

Additionally, survey data revealed that whilst 75.8% agreed it was their role to offer the influenza immunization, whilst 24.2% were either unsure or disagreed. A recently published pilot study has revealed that midwives receive approximately four hours immunization education in Australian degree courses (Attwell, Yusuf, & Frawley, 2019) . This education can be spread across differing units and across differing years of an undergraduate course. The results of our study have demonstrated that this is inadequate. Our study has demonstrated a knowledge difference between experienced (\u22655 years) and inexperienced (<5 years) midwives (p=0.047). This suggests that the knowledge deficit present in inexperienced midwives, can to some degree, be reversed through experience.

There is little evidence to suggest that midwives received or benefitted from, any immunological or vaccination related education provided in Bachelor of Midwifery courses (Attwell et al., 2019) . Additionally, midwives who had received training via the Understanding Immunization courses stated that they benefitted from it in terms of both education, confidence and vaccine provision. There was also a significant difference in knowledge and practice between RM/RN and RM as well as midwives with greater experience >5 years and <5 years.

This can be attributed to both the absence of an accurate data identification method by the Australian Immunization Register (Australian Government Department of Human Services, 2019) and to the absence of immunization data recorded in the Perinatal Outcomes Information (South Australia) (SA Health, 2016) . For this reason the numbers of pregnant women receiving the influenza immunization is currently unknown despite estimates of around 40% (O' Grady et al., 2015; White, Petersen, & Quinlivan, 2010) . One recent publication was able to lift that number to 76% with the aid of a midwifery led immunization program however, it is not yet known if this was a sustained increase in immunization levels (Mohammed et al., 2018) .",

Additionally, the survey instrument has face validity and was validated prior to data collection using a test-retest process, resulting in a Cohens' Kappa coefficient of K=0.804. This aim of this paper was to investigate the role of South Australian midwives in the promotion and provision of antenatal influenza immunization. With this in mind, we sought to obtain data from a variety of sites and a from midwives across a variety of working environments.

We believe that this was achieved, and our results are generalizable within the Australian midwifery community.",
