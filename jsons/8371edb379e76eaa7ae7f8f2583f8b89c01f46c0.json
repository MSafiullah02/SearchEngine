Specifically, PwDs are more likely to have an underlying health problem 2, 3 and are more likely to live in congregate care settings than those without disabilities. 4 Both of these factors have been shown to increased risk for Covid-19 infections. 5, 6 Additionally, because of the nature of some disabilities, individuals may have difficulty practicing routine preventive measures. For example, people who rely on assistance with personal care will be unable to maintain physical distancing, while others may have difficulty communicating symptoms of illness, resulting in delays in diagnosis and additional virus spread.",

Instead, we mostly rely upon circumstantial information, such as reports of Covid-19 outbreaks among PwDs living in residential care facilities, 11 or inferences we can make about the risk of severe health outcomes in PwDs, given their higher rates of chronic health conditions. 9 It is uncertain whether children with disabilities are at higher risk of serious complications from Covid-19 infection https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/han00432.asp.

Following Hurricane Katrina, it was found that PwDs already had meaningful support networks in place that allowed them to be more resilient through the disaster compared to many without disabilities. 21 Enhancing that resiliency through targeted strategies may be beneficial given that the need to selfisolate may go on for some time. These strategies may include easing of restrictions on visits by family members in residential or group home settings by offering routine virus and symptom testing, working with advocacy groups to create virtual and setting-specific ways to engage with those socially isolated (virtual gatherings, social chat rooms, online exercise and movie or game nights), and working with local businesses to provide easier ways to address essential needs and services (specialized grocery delivery services including extending curbside pickups, ride share services that target PwDs, and exclusive hours of service for health care or hygiene services -dental, hair appointments.) 7",

            "text": "Some PwDs worry that they may not get the best healthcare because of their disability. This fear was intensified early on in the global Covid-19 outbreak discussions of the need to ration lifesaving medical equipment. PwDs are disadvantaged because of the pervasive negative biases and inaccurate assumptions about their quality of life. When quality of life, quality-adjusted life years, or disabilityadjusted life years are considered in medical rationing decisions, PwDs are unfairly disadvantaged, not because they have lower quality of life, but because they are wrongly assumed to have lower quality of life. 22 In fact, several states adopted crisis standards of care guidelines that categorically excluded people with intellectual disability from accessing scarce medical resources. 23 While the shortage of critical care and medical equipment is lessening, a recent New Yorker article featured several adults who are deaf and blind who expressed concerns about the inherent biases they may face in receiving equitable treatment. 24 To communicate with doctors or other health care providers, a person who is deaf and blind needs an interpreter. Because of infection control requirements, the lack of this essential help in the ICU or other hospital settings leaves a person with communication needs especially vulnerable. The no visitor policies adopted by hospitals to protect patients, hospital personnel, and visitors is particularly problematic for patients with disabilities who rely on assistance with activities of daily living. Exceptions to the no visitor policy are needed to ensure that known and acknowledged support persons (such as designated family member, direct support professionals, or other designated caregivers) are permitted to be with the patient starting with admission and through to the care/treatment process. Such an exception would likely be considered a \"reasonable accommodation\" under the Americans with Disabilities Act and would improve communication between the hospital staff and PwDs and allow for informed and shared decision making. 25 Hospitals may consider adopting protocols for providing infection control briefings and providing appropriate PPEs to support persons.",

From what we know about other respiratory infections, people with intellectual disabilities and children with neurologic disabilities may be at higher risk of severe outcomes from Covid-19 disease, and we can act now to ensure they have information and supports to mitigate this potential risk. We can also anticipate that many PwDs will shelter-in-place for long periods of time to reduce their risk of infection. We can plan services and supports to meet the need for meaningful social interactions to maintain mental health and well-being while self-isolating. Because of the rapid nature of the public health response, it is critical to periodically reassess and readjust our approach to best address the needs of PwDs in the months and years to come and to incorporate these new practices into future emergency preparedness responses.",
