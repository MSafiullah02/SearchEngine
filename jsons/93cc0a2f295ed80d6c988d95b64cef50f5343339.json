It is unlikely to have led to bias, as the end-point of cure of all lesions is an objective and specific end-point. Staining did not put patients off continuing the treatment, which was done by motivated parents, and could be overcome by reformulating the acidified nitrite, substituting a reducing acid for the salicylic acid.

NO has specific antiviral effects at levels below those toxic to host cells, 6 by inhibiting viral replication. It probably acts on several targets by inhibiting RNA synthesis, DNA replication, early and late viral protein synthesis and by nitrosylating viral structural proteins. 4 We have shown that higher concentrations of NO from nitrite and ascorbic acid are immunopotentiating. We showed that NO caused lymphocyte, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, expression of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and migration of antigen-presenting cells. 22 We also showed an increase in p53. It is therefore possible that NO acts through DNA toxicity to infected cells, promoting apoptotic cell death.
