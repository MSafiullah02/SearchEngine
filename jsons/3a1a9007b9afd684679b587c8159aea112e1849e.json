The subject was previously well with no symptoms indicative or suggestive of active tuberculosis. A routine tuberculosis skin test was performed because the patient had applied to be a volunteer at a local hospital. She had no significant past illness or known allergies, and she was never diagnosed with nor had known contact with anyone with active tuberculosis. The subject never ingested alcohol and was not known to have hepatitis or be a carrier of any hepatitis virus. Baseline investigations performed by the internist included routine complete blood count, routine biochemical tests (liver enzymes, creatinine, and glucose), serum ferritin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone -all of which were normal. A chest radiograph was reported to be normal.",

At the followup appointment 3 months later, her only symptom was that of knee pain, which was treated as osteoarthritis with diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Five weeks later, she returned to see the internist with a history of increased dark colored urine and yellowish skin discoloration for a few weeks. Blood tests were ordered and patient was referred to a gastroenterologist. She was assessed by the gastroenterologist a week later, who noted symptoms of dark urine and yellowish skin discoloration for a month. The specialist noted the patient to be mildly icteric with a bilirubin of 51 mmol/L (normal <20 mmol/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 352 m/L (normal 25-96 m/L), and the serum glutamateoxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) was 1,102 m/L (normal 4-28 m/L). The isoniazid was then discontinued and further investigations were performed. Serologies for the hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C) revealed no acute infection but immunity to hepatitis A and B, and a liver ultrasound was normal.",

            "text": "The case under discussion does not fall into the high-risk category for treatment of latent tuberculosis, but may be considered as an intermediate risk on cursory assessment. Although employees and staff of healthcare facilities, especially those involved in direct patient contact, should be offered treatment of latent tuberculosis, there is no such stipulation for volunteers in hospitals. Most healthcare facilities screen volunteers for active tuberculosis by Mantoux skin test and chest radiograph for those with positive reaction. Another category under which the subject could be considered is an indication for treatment of latent tuberculosis include persons from highly endemic countries within 5 years of immigration with a positive Mantoux test (10 mm), irrespective of previous BCG vaccination. This group of people represent one of the largest segment of newly diagnosed patients with active tuberculosis in North America and Europe. 2, 3 In 2006, 57% of all tuberculosis cases in the United States were among foreign-born persons, 4 and in several European countries >50% of tuberculosis case occur among foreign-born people. 5 There are 22 countries with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) that account for 80% of the TB cases globally. 6 These countries are located predominantly in Asia (South East Asia and Western Pacific regions) Africa, Brazil (South America), the Russian Federation (Eastern Europe), and Afghanistan (Middle East). The estimated new TB cases (all forms) per 100,000 people per year in Iran is 22, which falls in the low risk category (0-24) as present in North America and Western Europe. 6 The incidence and prevalence of TB in the Middle East varies from country to country, and Iran actually falls into the relatively lower risk group The indication for treatment of latent TB in this case is borderline or very debatable, but most physicians (including internists) may not be aware of this fact. The treatment of choice for latent TB is now standardized to a 9-month course of isoniazid (INH) 300 mg once daily for adults, with or without pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to prevent peripheral neuritis. This is believed to be about 90% effective in preventing future reactivation of TB; but it does not prevent re-infection (with a new strain), which is a risk mainly in highly endemic countries. The main worrisome adverse effect of INH is clinical hepatitis, which can be fatal or lead to fulminant hepatitis that requires liver transplantation. There are two types of hepatic toxicity seen in INH; a common transient elevation of the transaminases seen in 10-30% of patients that occurs within 4-6 months and is benign and asymptomatic, and clinical hepatitis (symptomatic) which is much less common, age-related, and only occurs in about 1% of treated patients. Clinical hepatitis with INH is rare under 20 years of age and increases to about 2-2.3% above 50 years, and in persons >65 years, the risk increases to about 4.5%. 1 About 50% of INH hepatitis occurs in the first few months of treatment and the remainder occurs later up to 12 months (if still on INH). 7 The prognosis of overt INH hepatitis is usually very good if the drugs are discontinued promptly with the first sign of clinical hepatitis. The overall mortality is about 10% or 4.2 per 100,000 patients treated with INH. 7 Middle-aged black women seem to have the worst prognosis from this complication. In the majority of patients, there is clinical and biochemical resolution of signs and laboratory abnormality within 1-2 months of stopping the drug. Occasionally, patients can present or develop a sub-acute, more protracted course that mimics chronic viral hepatitis and leads to cirrhosis. 7 The pathogenesis of INH hepatotoxicity was initially considered to be an idiosyncratic reaction, but there is increasing evidence that this is a direct toxic effect of metabolite(s). There appears to be a higher risk and greater severity with higher doses, and higher incidence in slow acetylators. 8, 9 Animal experiments show that INH metabolism leads to acetyl hydrazine, which after oxidation forms toxic intermediates. These are thought to produce damaging effects by acetylating or alkylating macromolecules within liver cells, but the exact mechanism of liver cell injury is unknown. 7 In slow acetylators, acetyl hydrazine accumulates and predisposes to hepatotoxicity. Another metabolic pathway involves hydrolysis of INH to hydrazine and isonicotinic acid. Hydrazine is known to be directly hepatotoxic and hydrolysis of INH is increased by alcohol and rifampin. 9 The mechanism of agerelated hepatotoxicity is unclear, but could possibly be related to the slowing of acetylation with advancing age.",

            "text": "Most guidelines and recommendations of latent TB strongly discourage treatment with INH in patients with active liver disease. Close clinical and biochemical monitoring for liver toxicity are mainly recommended for subjects with high risk for clinical hepatitis, such as older people (65 years), those with history of liver disease, chronic carriers of hepatitis B and C, alcohol abusers, concomitant users of other hepatotoxic drugs, and subjects who suffer from malnutrition or AIDS. Current textbooks of medicine do not recommend routine biochemical monitoring for healthy adults being treated with INH. 10 In these circumstances, baseline liver tests are performed and patients should be counseled on symptoms of clinical side effects and should be monitored clinically. Some experts and the manufacturer recommend biochemical monitoring for persons >35 years old, pregnant women, (and those within 3 months post-partum), monthly for 3 months, then afterwards at 1-3 month intervals. 1, 11 INH should be discontinued promptly at the first sign of clinical hepatitis. Symptoms of hepatitis may include fatigue, weakness or fever >3 days, malaise, unexplained anorexia, right upper quadrant pain or discomfort, and jaundice. If the ALT is 3-5 times the upper limit of normal, the drug should be discontinued, even if the patient is asymptomatic. Restarting INH at a small dose has been recommended by some experts in asymptomatic patients. It is of interest to note that the American Thoracic Society, the British Thoracic Society, and the Task Force of the European Respiratory Society only recommend regular biochemical monitoring of liver function on multidrug treatment for TB in patients with chronic liver disease or increased serum transaminases prior to treatment. 12 In the case of symptoms of hepatotoxicity, the liver function should be examined. This may be based on the fact that there is no good evidence that routine monitoring of liver function will decrease the chance of fulminant hepatitis or fatality, and prompt discontinuation of medications with first onset of symptoms usually results in full recovery in those with clinical hepatitis.",

With any serious adverse event, to make an assessment requires several steps and investigations to reach a valid conclusion. This involves a process of deduction and exclusion of other etiologies (such as hepatitis virus), other agents, and use of Bayes theorem to assess overall probability (definite, probable, or possible), as well as posterior and prior probability (based on known literature reports). Other considerations include temporal relationship with use of the medication, compatibility of clinical features and laboratory data, histopathology data and previous reports, and reproduction of the event by re-challenge with the putative agent.

The patient was also receiving diclofenac, which started 5 weeks before the clinical diagnosis of hepatitis and 2-3 weeks before the onset of symptoms. Thus, there is a temporal relationship with diclofenac treatment and the onset of clinical hepatitis. NSAIDs in general are known, but rare causes of drug-induced hepatitis. 7 The incidence of diclofenac-induced clinical hepatitis is about 1-5 per 100,000 users, and the incubation period varies from 3 to 12 weeks (consistent with the present case). 7 Data from the diclofenac monograph (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) indicates that there is a higher incidence of moderate to severe (3-8 times upper limit of normal) and marked (>8 times normal) elevation of transaminases when compared to other NSAIDs. In addition, rare causes of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, and fulminant fatal hepatitis (or requiring liver transplant) have been reported with diclofenac. To date, there is no evidence of enhanced risk of clinical hepatitis in patients receiving both INH and diclofenac or other NSAIDs. Elderly women are more susceptible to NSAIDs-induced hepatitis. Histopathology of the liver usually reveals zone 3 or 5 spotty acute hepatocellular necrosis, but there can be granulomas, cholestasis, hepatic eosinophilia, and even chronic active hepatitis with overuse of NSAIDs. 7 The prognosis is usually very good from withdrawal of NSAIDs.

Early in the process, there is a predominance of CD 8 killer T lymphocytes in the epidermis and dermis of bullous lesions, and later monocytes develop. Cytotoxic CD 8 T cells express a-b Tcell receptors are able to kill cells through production of perforin and granzyme B. Drugs are the most important causes of EN and TEN and >100 different drugs are implicated. CD 8 oligoclonal expansion corresponds to a drug specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted cytotoxicity against keratinocytes. 17 Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFa, and Fas ligand are also present in skin lesions. Genetic susceptibility appears to be important, and there is strong association with Han Chinese with HLA-B5802 leucocyte antigen and SJS induced by carbamazepine, and HLA-B5801 antigen and SJS induced by allopurinol. 17 High-risk drugs (about 12) from six different classes, account for 50% of EN reactions. These include allopurinol, sulfonamides, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, lamotrigine), nevirapine (non-nucleoside analog), oxicam NSAIDS, and thiacetazone. 18 The incubation period for EN ranges from 4 to 30 days, but most cases occur within 8 weeks of starting the medication. Rare cases can appear within hours of use, or same day if they had prior reaction. Early, non-specific symptoms (fever, headache, rhinitis, myalgias) may precede mucocutaneous lesions by 1-3 days. Some patients may also present with pain on swallowing or stinging of the eyes. About one third of patients begin with non-specific symptoms, another third with primary mucous membrane involvement, and the rest present with an exanthema. 17 Progression from a localized area to full body involvement can vary from hours to days. The classification of EN depends on areas of detachable epidermidis by a positive Nikolsky sign (dislodgement of epidermidis by lateral pressure) and flaccid blisters. The diagnosis of SJS is made when there is less than 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement; SJS/TEN overlaps with 10-30% BSA, and TEN for >30% BSA involvement. 17 In severe cases of EN, the mucous membranes (buccal, ocular, genital) are involved in about 90%, and 85% have conjunctival affliction consisting mainly of hyperemia, erosions, chemosis, photophobia, and excessive lacrimation. Severe form of eye involvement can result in shedding of eyelashes, corneal ulceration (as in Case 2), anterior uveitis, and purulent conjunctivitis. 17 Extra-cutaneous complications mainly seen in severe TEN may include pulmonary disease (25%) with hypoxia, hemoptysis, bronchial mucosal casts, interstitial changes, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which carries a poor prognosis. The gastrointestinal tract involvement is less common, but can include esophageal necrosis, small bowel disease with malabsorption, and colonic disease (diffuse diarrhea and bleeding). Renal involvement is mainly proteinuria and hematuria, but proximal renal tubular damage can sometimes cause renal failure.",

There was no evidence of improvement in mortality, progression of detachment, nor reepidermalization. Most deaths occurred in elderly patients with initially impaired renal function. Thus, IVIG is not recommended for EN unless being assessed in a randomized clinical trial. The death rate with IVIG was 32%, which was higher than the historical death rate in the same center (20%), in historical controls with TEN not treated with IVIG. 22 Thus, IVIG may be harmful in patients with EN.",

Is it the responsibility of the physicians to explain all potential albeit rare adverse effects of any treatment? The courts may take in consideration the standard practice of the physician's peers, or what is considered accepted practice. Most physicians (if they do counsel patients on medications) would mention the most common side effects, but would not usually mention rare adverse effects. For instance, it would be justifiable to mention that a drug rash could be seen with TMP-SMX, if the patient happens to be allergic to the drug (which should be discontinued as soon as this occurs). As physicians, we would not usually mention that there is a rare risk of shedding of the skin, blindness, or death. Similarly, when prescribing penicillin in patients not known allergic to the drug, we generally do not counsel that there is a 1:50,000 to 1:300,000 risk of dying from anaphylaxis (which is treatable). Yet, if we were to order or prescribe chloramphenicol, it is expected that we should counsel the patient that there is a 1:50,000 to 1:300,000 risk of aplastic anemia, which is not treatable except by bone marrow transplantation. Hence, it may be asked; what is the best method of informing patients on medication toxicity? It is acceptable to leave this to pharmacists to provide literature on these drugs as the sole form of counseling. It is the prescriber's responsibility to obtain informed consent before ordering the medications.",

The overall VZV infection mortality was 9.7% (23 of 231) -all with disseminated infection in the first 9 months. However, the mortality in those with herpes zoster was only 6.6% versus 27.7% of those with varicella. 28 High dose corticosteroids are also associated with significant complications of varicella and herpes zoster. 29 Immunosuppression is most commonly seen with high daily dose of 1 mg/kg of prednisone or moderate doses for prolonged periods. Rates of infectious complication were not increased in patients given a daily dose of less than 10 mg daily, or a cumulative dose of less than 700 mg prednisone in a meta-analysis of 73 controlled trials. 30 Many experts consider prolonged daily dose 15 mg prednisone or equivalent to be immunosuppressive. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that low doses of prednisone (or similar agents) for prolonged periods may also increase the risk of infection. 31 Corticosteroids can suppress several stages of the immune response that leads to inflammation, but the main immunosuppressive effect is on the cellular immunity. Thus, steroids can increase the risk and severity of a variety of infectious agents (virus, bacteria, fungi, and parasites). Most notable are agents that require intact cellular immunity for control and eradication, such as herpes viruses, mycobacteria, listeria, nocardia, pneumocystis, candida, cryptococci, toxoplasma, and strongyloides, etc., are increased in patients on prolonged corticosteroids.",

            "text": "The effect of corticosteroids on the inflammatory and immune responses is pleomorphic. An earlier study in guinea pigs demonstrated that similar levels of lymphocytopenia were induced by acute and chronic corticosteroid administration, but only chronic treatment was associated with depression of certain cell-mediated lymphocyte functions. 32 Chronic cortisone treatment resulted in marked decrease in both antigen-induced migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and proliferation, although mitogen responses remained normal. Over the last few decades, corticosteroids have been found to inhibit the function of various cell types: (1) macrophage/monocytesinhibit cyclooxygenase-2 and phospholipase A 2 (interrupting prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways), and suppress cytokine production and release of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, (2) endothelial cells -impair endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-I (ELAM-I), and intracellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I), that are critical for leucocyte localization, (3) basophils -block histamine and leukotriene 4c IgE-dependent release, (4) fibroblast -inhibit arachidonic pathway (as with monocytes) and suppress growth factor-induced DNA synthesis and fibroblast proliferation, (5) lymphocytes -inhibit cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-a, GM-CSF, and interferon g production or expression. 33 The association of steroid therapy and increased risk, severity and complications of VZV infections has been well established for decades. 34 Patients receiving highdose corticosteroids are at risk for disseminated disease and fatality, whereas patients on low-dose schedules are not at increased risk. 34, 35 Esophagitis and gastrointestinal involvement of VZV are distinctly rare and have been described in both immunocompromised hosts and apparently healthy subjects as complications of chickenpox or herpes zoster. Disseminated varicella in autopsy studies of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma on chemotherapy had demonstrated involvement of the esophagus, small bowel, colon, liver, spleen, and pancreas. 36 Fulminant and fatal cases of varicella hepatitis have been described predominantly in immunosuppressed children and adults, but also in healthy people. 37 Rare cases of adult varicella on chronic steroids (for asthma) have been reported with small bowel involvement presenting with abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. 38 However, it appears that the patient may have been on moderately high dose of methylprednisolone (40 mg daily). In an immunocompetent young adult on inhaled steroids for asthma, varicella has been reported to cause diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness with hepatic, esophageal, and pulmonary involvement, with recovery after acyclovir therapy. 39 Bullous and necrotic ulcerative lesions of the esophagus and stomach have been described in the pathology literature of fatal varicella as early as 1940. 40 Stomach and small bowel changes detected by radiological imaging has also been reported in a case of chickenpox. 41 Occasionally healthy adults with varicella may have mild symptoms of esophagitis that respond to antihistamine-H2 blockers, suggesting temporary esophageal reflux. 42 Shingles esophagitis have also been seen on endoscopy in patients without widespread dissemination of herpes zoster and benign course. 43 ",

            "text": "The deceased patient (Case 3) was receiving 8 mg daily of methylprednisolone prior to his presentation with chickenpox. This dose is equivalent to 10 mg prednisone and normally would not be considered to be immunosuppressive. However, the course of the disease and widespread dissemination with fatality resembles that of an immunocompromised host. How can we explain this reaction? The possibilities include: (1) inaccurate history of the steroid dose provided by the patient, (2) rarely, dissemination and fatality can occur in healthy adults, (3) unrecognized immunocompromised state such as HIV infection or rare genetic mutations, or polymorphisms in genes involved in cellular immunity, and (4) higher free active concentration of the drug than would be expected. Methylprednisolone (Medrol) is 70% bound to protein, mainly albumin, and decrease in serum albumin by 30-50% could increase the active unbound drug almost to the same proportion. On admission to hospital, the patient's serum albumin was 15 g/L (lower limit of normal 35 g/L), 42% of the normal lower limit. Although the serum albumin can decrease in acute illness from varicella, the half-life of circulating albumin is 15 days and thus, even after 7 days of chickenpox, it should not decrease more than 25% below normal, even if his liver stopped producing any protein (which is not likely). Hence, the patient probably had a chronically low serum albumin from his chronic colitis. His free concentration of corticosteroid should have been greater than 50% of his expected active drug, which is equivalent to 15 mg prednisone/day.",

The low frequency of serious complications (pneumonia, encephalitis, or death) precluded any evaluation of acyclovir on these outcomes. In immunocompromised patients with VZV infection, later initiation of therapy (72 h after onset of rash) may be of value. 45, 46 Although there is no RCT to prove the benefit of intravenous acyclovir in normal adults with varicella complicated by visceral involvement, observational and cohort studies suggest benefit. 47 Thus, intravenous acyclovir continues to be the standard therapy for healthy adults and immunocompromised hosts with clinically significant visceral disease (pneumonia, encephalitis) or dissemination.",

            "text": "Chronic corticosteroid therapy can have numerous side effects and complications. It is important for physicians to counsel their patients on these potential adverse events, and provide a risk-benefit assessment. Many organs and systems in the body can be adversely affected by chronic steroid therapy (endocrine, bone, eyes, muscle, brain, immune system, skin, etc.). It is important to counsel on potential increased risk of infectious diseases and certain precautions should be taken before embarking on chronic therapy. These include a Mantoux skin test and treatment for latent tuberculosis in those with positive reactions and about to receive prednisone 15 mg/day for 30 days. 48 A baseline chest radiograph for active or inactive disease should be performed beforehand. It is also recommended that steroid dependent children should undergo VZV antibody test, and if this were negative, then varicella vaccination should be offered. 33 It seems prudent to apply these guidelines to adults as well on chronic steroid therapy. For patients with previous chickenpox or adequate antibodies, varicella zoster vaccine may be considered to reduce the risk and severity of shingles. This vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine has been found effective and is recommended for persons 60 years of age to reduce the burden of illness and incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. 49 Presently, this vaccine is not indicated in immunocompromised adults, so it should be administered before starting prolonged steroids. The product monograph of Zostavax TM (Merck), states that the varicella zoster vaccine is contraindicated in patients receiving high-dose corticosteroid, but not contraindicated for individuals on inhaled or low-dose steroids. The varicella vaccine has been found safe in children with moderate immune deficiency, 50 but it is contraindicated in those with substantial suppression of cellular immunity (as with high-dose steroid). 51 What should have been the appropriate steps of action in this case? Once the FP was notified that the patient's child had chickenpox, he should have counseled the father and determined his previous past history or antibody level against VZV. For patients considered non-immune and severely immunosuppressed (moderate to high-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day) VZV immune globulin should be offered and treatment with acyclovir should be instituted at the first sign of varicella. 33 Since the deceased was considered to be receiving a low dose of steroid, then it was more appropriate to offer treatment with acyclovir at the first sign of a typical rash, or provide a prescription to be filled within 24 h of onset of varicella.",
