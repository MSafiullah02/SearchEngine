            "text": "Histopathological examination of lung tissue specimens, including in situ hybridization of RV RNA, would be helpful to establish the role of RVs in pneumonia development. However, such examination is rarely possible in clinical practice. A prior report suggests that RVs infect a small subset of lower airway epithelial cells [7] and activate marked inflammatory responses, rather than directly invade lower airways in the lower respiratory tract epithelium [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, RV detection using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens from severe pneumonia patients may be an indirect but meaningful indicator for the pathogenic role of RV. However, clinical data using BAL specimens from unselected adult patients with RV-associated pneumonia are scarce [10], [16], [17], with some studies investigating small subsets of a retrospective series of respiratory virus infection [16], [17]. The majority of prior studies using BAL specimens were confined to small groups of hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [12], [18], [19], [20], which limits our understanding of RV-associated pneumonia.",

The two most common bacterial co-pathogens, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, are common colonizers of the nasopharynx [29], [30], [31]. In the present study, bacterial coinfection tended to be less frequent in the RV group than in the IFV group, and S. aureus was exclusively identified in the IFV group. Bacterial coinfection in influenza infection is likely caused by IFV propagation along the respiratory tree, together with mucociliary clearance impairment and IFV-induced respiratory tract epithelial cell damage [28]. By contrast, RVs involve only a small proportion of epithelial cells in the upper [32] and lower airway epithelium [7]. Therefore, the lower frequency of bacterial coinfection and septic shock may be due to the reduced extent of epithelial damage with RV infection. Since our study used different inclusion criteria for the two groups and included only patients with severe pneumonia admitted to medical ICU, the difference in the bacterial coinfection rate between the groups may have been biased. The proportion of individuals admitted to the ICU because of secondary bacterial pneumonia rather than viral pneumonia may be higher in the IFV group. Bacterial coinfection is a key cause of death in 20th century influenza pandemics [29], [30], and bacterial coinfection was also associated with an increased risk of death in 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) [31], [33]. In our results, however, bacterial coinfection was not associated with poorer outcomes in either IFV group or RV group, although the small numbers in our group may limit the generalizability of our findings and warrant further investigation.",

Recently, a U.S. group compared the characteristics between 2009 pH1N1 and other respiratory viruses in patients hospitalized with respiratory illness [34] and found that the presence of fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms increased the likelihood of pH1N1 almost 10-fold in the pediatric population. Our study was limited to severe pneumonia patients admitted to the ICU, and more than two-thirds of both groups had respiratory symptoms. Therefore, a symptom-based approach is likely not reliable in differentiating clinical diagnoses among adult patients with severe pneumonia. The seasonal distribution of each respiratory virus and the temporal occurrence of respiratory viral illness in the community may help predict viral pathogens. Nevertheless, PCR tests for respiratory viruses are reliable and should be included for etiological diagnosis in patients with severe pneumonia.",

Nevertheless, mortalities of patients were similarly high in both groups, likely reflecting the more frequent presence of immunocompromised conditions in the RV group. Taken together, our data suggest that host factor is an important contributor to the development of severe RV-associated pneumonia and affects the outcome.",

First, protected specimen brushing was not used during the study period, meaning BAL fluid may have been contaminated by upper airway secretions during the bronchoscopic procedure. Second, even in BAL fluid RV PCR-positive cases, RVs might be present as non-pathogenic colonizers. Third, because we did not perform a molecular study for serogrouping and serotyping, the impact of RV species and strains could not be evaluated. Finally, the RV group only included PCR-positive cases from BAL fluid, whereas the IFV group also included PCR-positive cases from nasopharyngeal specimens, indicating a possibility for biases associated with these different inclusion criteria.",
