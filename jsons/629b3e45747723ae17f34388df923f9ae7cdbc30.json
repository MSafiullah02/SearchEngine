However, most event recorder (ER) data shows only regular driving events. To utilize near-miss data for safe-driving education, we need to be able to easily and rapidly locate the appropriate data from large amounts of ER data through labels attached to the scenes/events of interest. This paper proposes a method that can automatically identify near-misses with objects such as pedestrians and bicycles by processing the ER data. The proposed method extracts two deep feature representations that consider car status and the environment surrounding the car. The first feature representation is generated by considering the temporal transitions of car status. The second one can extract the positional relationship between the car and surrounding objects by processing object detection results. Experiments on actual ER data demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify and tag near-miss events.",

The event recorder permanently stores all data dozens of seconds on either side of the trigger of longitudinal/lateral acceleration/deceleration exceedings a certain level. In this paper, we call such data event recorder (ER) data. ER data is being effectively used as traffic accident/violation evidence. In addition, ER data that demonstrates near-miss traffic incidents (\"near-miss\"), such as near collisions between the car and other obstacles, is being considered for use in reducing traffic accidents. Actual examples of near-miss scenes captured by ERs are shown in Fig. 1 . The ER data of near-misses is best utilized pro-active education that targets safer driving. An example of safe-driving education is to have drivers watch actual ER footage of near-miss traffic incidents [17] . In addition, near-miss incidents in ER data are attracting the attention of fleet management companies that need to control scores of commercial motor vehicles such as vans and trucks. For example, car leasing and commercial trucking companies can evaluate each driver's skills by processing the front video captured by Internet-connected cameras 2 . A car insurance company is detecting dangerous areas in town and creating hazard maps based on traffic accidents or near-miss as found in ER data 3 . As just described, various services/applications are using the near-miss events present in ER data; they represent new opportunities for eliminating or minimizing the risks associated with vehicle operation.",

This is because the acceleration limits used to trigger the ER can be exceeded by rough roads and abrupt driving inputs. Moreover, actual safe-driving education organizers expect the ER data to be tagged and sorted according the type of incident (e.g. pedestrian and bicycle) because they want to extract the best possible videos as safe-driving education material for each incident type. Unfortunately, manually identifying and labelling all near-miss incidents from the large amount of ER data available is too time consuming, expensive, and error prone. Therefore, the automating the process is essential to reducing the cost of safe-driving education and strengthening the effective use of ER data. The objective of this paper is to automatically detect the presence of near-miss incidents and then accurately identify near-miss type.",

This involves using a CNN to extract basic visual features. However, the task of classifying the near-miss incidents requires an understanding of the kind of object and its position relation to the car. Simple CNNs can't extract visual features with sufficient detail. Issue 2: The task of identifying near-miss incidents can be treated as a two-level hierarchy classification task. First, each ER segment is classified into nearmiss or no near-miss. Second, the near-miss object in each ER segment is identified. However, general multi-class classification frameworks don't provide such a hierarchical architecture, and instead attempt to solve the two classification tasks simultaneously (i.e. treat the task as a one-level classification task). This makes the task more complex which degrades classification accuracy.",

The second component, the Grid Embedding Layer, creates a feature vector by embedding object detection results into a grid space by determining the positions of each object relative to the car. The third component, the Multi-task Layer, splits the main task into two sub-tasks to classify near-miss type.

Their model demonstrated improved accuracy in near-miss detection by introducing pedestrian detection task as sub-function. While their model detect near-miss scenes using front video, they do not consider the classification of the near-miss incidents. Dashcam data has been used for various tasks other than near-miss detection. By extracting driver operations from dashcam data, Yokoyama et al. [20] use feature engineering to detect the drivers with dangerous driving styles. Front video is a significant part of autonomous vehicle driving technology. To permit autonomous control of vehicle movement, Jain et al.

For example, [2] jointly learns representations of words, entities, and meaning representations via multi-task learning. [1] shows the effectiveness of this approach with regard to various natural language processing tasks including part-ofspeech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. Following the success of these multi-task learning approaches, the innovation of our multi-task learning is to learn a classifier specific to each sub-task; we extract effective features and obtain new feature vectors for performing each sub-task. All features including frame image, sensor streams, and object detection results can be useful for determining whether each video contains a near-miss incident or not. However, once we know that a video contains a near-miss, object detection results constitute the most helpful information for determining the near-miss targets because they allow us to understand the kind of objects around the car. While single task learning must learn such features implicitly, our multi-task learning can learn them explicitly as isolated features.",

Each sequence was manually assigned one of five risk levels {high, middle, low, bit, no near-miss} and six near-miss incident types {car, bicycle, motorcycle, pedestrian, self, other} by experts. The experiment focused on five near-miss incidents {car, bicycle, motorcycle, pedestrian, self 5 }. 700 sequences were randomly extracted for each near-miss incident type. 700 sequences tagged no near-miss were also randomly extracted. Therefore, the experiment examined 4,200 sequences with 6 labels (C = 6). We randomly split the dataset into 2,940 (70%) sequences as training data and 1,260 (30%) as test data. Each sequence was recorded at 30 frames per second and so consisted of 450 frames. In this paper, we sampled T = 30 frames at intervals of 15 frames. Each image had resolution of W = 640 and H = 400 in RGB format. The original images were processed by YOLO for object detection. This yielded V = 69 object types.
