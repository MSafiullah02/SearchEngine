The vaccine is used for wide-scale immunization of children in tropical areas, travelers and military personnel. This long experience in >350 million people has provided assurances of safety and efficacy, making yellow fever an ideal vector for foreign genes. However, there are disadvantages to this practice. As with any other positive-strand virus, the high rate of genetic variation caused by viral replication by polymerases without proofreading enzymes and mutations involved in adaptation to different host cells could lead to unexpected surprises. Replacing the structural genes of YF 17D with those of other flaviviruses might alter tropism, and the potential of replication in unanticipated tissues will have to be examined individually. On the other hand, a significant advantage of a live vaccine includes the development of rapid and durable humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that closely mimic those directed against the wild-type virus.",

WN virus was first isolated from a febrile adult woman in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 18, 19. The virus was not recognized as a cause of severe meningoencephalitis until an outbreak in Israel in 1957 20. After appearing over subsequent years in Europe, Asia and Australia, where it afflicted humans and horses, WN made its appearance in North America in 1999 18. Since the first recorded outbreak in the western hemisphere, WN has become part of the prevention and control mandate of several government agencies. The availability of a technology (ChimeriVax) based on the use of YF 17D as a vector to deliver effective immunity against JE virus, a close relative of WN virus, prompted the development of a WN vaccine. A formalin-inactivated JE vaccine (JE-VAX\u00ae, Aventis Pasteur) is available in the USA and marketed to travelers. Although immunity to JE might provide cross protection against WN in macaques 21, there are insufficient data to recommend the use of the JE-VAX\u00ae to protect humans and horses.",

            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies are the first line of defense against flaviviruses. In a live vaccine, virus replication induces a fast and durable response. cytotoxic t cells eliminate viruses that were able to establish intracellular infections. This defense mechanism recognizes the E protein as well as nonstructural proteins, making infected cells a target for cell killing 23. Exposure to the virus by natural infection post-vaccination would lead to a rapid secondary response, stronger than the primary response, and increased cross-reactivity with other members of the Flavivirus genus encoding similar epitopes. Studies in mice 24 and monkeys 25, 26 were conducted to determine the ability of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine to protect animals against challenge. Challenge of both immunized and control monkeys with JE virus was performed by an intracerebral (IC) inoculation of 5 log10 PFU. Natural JE infection occurs by peripheral inoculation of small doses of virus in mosquito saliva; it was estimated by in vitro methods that a female mosquito releases about 2 log10 PFU while blood feeding 27. Typically, rhesus monkeys do not develop brain infection and encephalitis after peripheral JE virus inoculation. The IC inoculation disease model is thus used in vaccine efficacy tests. Therefore, relative to peripheral natural infection, ICinoculation with 5 log10PFU is a severe test of protection. All ChimeraVax-JE immunized rhesus developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies after subcutaneous vaccination. Following IC challenge with a wild-type JE virus, vaccinated monkeys were 100% protected against viremia and clinical encephalitis providing clear evidence of vaccine efficacy 26.",

Flavivirus genome replication lacks proofreading activity, resulting in a significant rate of mutations. For example, one single codon alteration from GAA (glutamic acid) to AAA (lysine) in the envelope protein gene markedly reduced the virulence of a JE virus isolate 28. To study the genetic stability of a ChimeriVax vaccine construct, the virus was passed six times in brain tissue of mice and up to 18 times in cell culture. For ChimeriVax-JE, the vaccine genome and attenuated phenotype were shown to be stable on passage 24. The molecular basis of attenuation of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine was studied by systematic mutagenesis 22. Neurovirulent JE strains and attenuated JE strains were compared by sequence analysis, and amino acid residues in the prME sequence of the vaccine that were implicated in virulence were reverted. The elucidation of multiple attenuation determinants in the E gene provided a rationale for the development of a chimeric WN vaccine.",

The live-attenuated JE SA14-14-2 vaccine is used only in China and possesses an excellent safety record 29. The basis of attenuation lies within the genome sequence of these RNA viruses. Sequence changes affect the phenotype by altering the function of the gene products, the secondary structure integrity of the RNA molecules, or both. The effect of the sequence of the prME genes of JE on its virulence phenotype was revealed following mouse studies that compared ChimeriVax-JE with a corresponding neurovirulent YF/JE Nakayama construct 13. The study showed lack of neurovirulence for ChimeriVax-JE relative to the Nakayama construct or to a YF 17D vaccine control. The E proteins of wild-type and SA14-14-2 (attenuated) JE strains differ in ten amino acid residues (Table 1\n). A rational sequence reversion study to understand the basis of ChimeriVax-JE attenuation provided additional insight. Envelope amino acid residue E138 had a dominant effect, being required for reconstitution of neurovirulence in a mouse model, whereas E107, 176, 279, 264 and 227 residues, in that order, only contributed to measurable increases in neurovirulence 22.",

The sequence similarity of the E protein of WN and JE is shown in Fig. 2\n. Because of the high degree of similarity, it is hypothesized that the introduction of mutations linked to the attenuation of JE SA14-14-2 will also attenuate ChimeriVax-WN. For ChimeriVax-WN, the approach will be to systematically mutate the sequence of the wild-type WN NY99 strain E protein to assess the effect of single mutations at the equivalent of residues E138, 107, 176 and 279. Additional mutagenesis targets could be considered from the outcome of other Flavivirus studies. Mutations in the vicinity of E315 are associated with altered virus tropism and changes in virulence 31, 32, 33. Position E244 might not play a significant role as it is either a glycine (G) or glutamic acid (E) in several virulent JE strains analyzed 34, 36. Position E439 represents a conserved K\u2192R substitution in the transmembrane region of the E protein with very little chance of any major effect. A tyrosine (Y) at position E176 (Table 1) might contribute to the attenuation of ChimeriVax-WN in its present configuration. The hypothesis will be tested by targeted mutation of E176 to isoleucine and testing for an increase in neurovirulence. Eventually, combinatorial mutation studies will define an attenuated vaccine.Surprisingly, the chimeric ChimeriVax-WN construct containing wild-type WN prME was found to be significantly less neurovirulent than YF 17D vaccine. Young adult mice (five per group) inoculated IC with graded doses between 2 and 6 log10 PFU resulted in scattered deaths (ranging from 20\u201360% mortality) without a clear dose effect, perhaps owing to the susceptibility of the model used. By contrast, YF 17D was 100% lethal at doses >1 log10 PFU in the same mouse model. In addition, ChimeriVax-WN has lost the neuroinvasive property typical of wild-type WN. Virus replication in brain tissue or viremia levels in moribund animals was not measured. However, the average survival times (nine days) were similar for both viruses. The data suggest that the sequence-unmodified chimera might be a vaccine candidate. Ultimately, the safety of a live attenuated ChimeriVax-WN will rely on sequence stability of the genome particularly at the E protein amino acid positions identified to play a role in attenuation.",

Fort Dodge Animal Health (USA) has initiated development of both a formalin-inactivated and a DNA plasmid vaccine for horses. The DNA technology was developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ft. Collins (CO, USA) and a study in horses at Colorado State University demonstrated protection against virus challenge 35. Lustig et al. produced a live attenuated WN virus isolate derived from empirical passage of a wild-type strain in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells. One dose of the attenuated virus showed 100% protection in both mice and geese IC inoculation disease models challenged with a homologous wild-type WN (Ref. 37). A formalin-inactivated WN vaccine should work as effectively as JE-VAX\u00ae against JE. However, requiring multiple doses for efficacious protection, this vaccine would not be beneficial in an immediate threat of epidemic disease. A DNA vaccine for expression of WN prME genes only might be protective for horses but is likely to require multiple doses. Considering the possibility of a spontaneous virulent reversion owing to the relatively high mutation rate of RNA viruses, a live attenuated full-length WN vaccine is not as safe as the WN prME DNA vaccine. Furthermore, the WN prME DNA vaccine will produce antibodies only against the WN membrane proteins encoded in the plasmid thus the response to nonstructural viral genes, typical of natural WN infections, will be absent. This will facilitate screening of traded horses by the existing antibody detection methods. A chimeric live vaccine (ChimeriVax-WN) encoding the nonstructural genes of YF17D might be as effective in horses as the DNA vaccine. However, it has to be determined whether the vaccine will replicate and prove effective.",

The most promising candidates for a human vaccine include an \u2018old technology\u2019 formalin-inactivated virus vaccine, and a live chimeric vaccine where a rational approach is used to create a safe recombinant vaccine. A live vaccine that rapidly elicits immunity after a single dose would be much preferred over a multi-dose product for use in an impending epidemic, as surveillance of birds and mosquitoes provides only a brief warning of virus activity before the risk of human disease. The ecology of WN virus in the western hemisphere is still evolving. At least five species of mosquitoes were found to be competent vectors in experimental transmission studies with the WN NY99 strain 18. Further understanding of the basic transmission cycle of WN in birds and mosquitoes is needed to implement proper control mechanisms. Ultimately, clear definition of the risks associated with WN virus epidemics might help create sufficient preventive measures to avoid the use of a vaccine. In the meantime, for as long as outbreaks continue to occur predominantly in urban areas where media attention is so ubiquitous, and with a system that relies on sightings of dead crows to forecast a potential WN epidemic, the need to develop a vaccine will continue.",
