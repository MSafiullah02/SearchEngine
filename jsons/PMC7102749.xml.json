The Black Death, also called plague, raged in Asia for centuries before arriving by ship in Sicily in 1347 resulting in the extermination of entire villages as it ravaged across Europe (Beran, 2008). The Spanish conquistadors, introduced measles and smallpox, endemic in Europe, into the Americas with disastrous consequences for the native populations. However, it was not only people that were affected by invading armies. Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun and Napoleon all took contagious pleuropneumonia and rinderpest with them into conquered countries, which impacted greatly on local animal populations (Brown and Bolin, 2000).",

It covered the length of Africa within 10 years and killed more than 90% of Kenya's buffalo population resulting in a ripple effect that impacted on predators and even tsetse fly populations (Schwabe, 1969). A study of these outbreaks reveals that there are many commonalities between what has happened in the past and what is happening today and that what we are seeing today is not as new or revolutionary as we might think. The impact of rinderpest in the late 1800s in Africa was on a par with and probably exceeded the more modern outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Europe today. Hence, the impact of emerging diseases today is certainly not unprecedented.",

An example of the complex nature of these relationships is the local extinction of the endangered large blue butterfly (Maculinea arion) in the United Kingdom due to the change in habitat caused by the introduction of myxomatosis into rabbit populations (Daszak et al., 2000). The change in habitat because of the death of the rabbits resulted in the subsequent loss of red ant species (Myrmica sabuleti) required for the development of the butterfly, thus causing it to die out. In addition the rabbits were no longer available as the main food source for the Spanish lynx, causing their numbers to decline as well (Wikipedia, 2008). Sadly, there are many other examples of how biological pollution due to the efforts of humans has upset a stable ecosystem.",

Wildlife therefore, plays an important role in the frequency of emerging diseases. However, it must be kept in mind that the magnitude and impact of an emerging disease problem has very little to do with the fact that diseases come from wildlife. Other challenges determine the magnitude of the event, some of which are discussed below. So why do diseases come so frequently from wildlife and why are wild animals so important in our thinking?",

One of the recent diseases to emerge is a paramyxovirus called Hendra virus that first occurred near Brisbane in Australia in 1994, affecting horses with respiratory and nervous symptoms and rapidly killing them and a few of the people that came into contact with them (Wild, 2009, Plowright et al., 2008). Another paramyxovirus is Nipah virus that emerged in Malaysia in 1998, and was first isolated from pigs, also showing respiratory and nervous signs, and this was also found to infect and kill people that had come into contact with infected pigs or their meat (Wild, 2009). Ebola disease was first discovered in 1976 in central Africa and Sudan and is caused by a Filovirus, which causes a haemorrhagic syndrome that rapidly kills people resulting in mortality rates of up to 90%. Marburg virus is also a Filovirus that first killed laboratory staff working with monkey kidney cells in Germany in 1967. The Filoviruses were initially associated with primates from which people can contract the disease (Pastoret, 2000). Of more recent significance is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS, which killed 774 humans in 2003, rapidly travelling to nine countries by people-translocation during the Chinese New Year, primarily via the airlines. SARS was first associated with the Palm Masked Civet (Paguma larvata) (Kruse et al., 2004).",

In addition to the above diseases, two species of Australian bats, the Black Flying Fox (Pteropus alecto) and the Little Red Flying Fox (Pteropus scapulatus) were found to carry lyssavirus, a newly identified virus related to rabies virus. In fact, since the 1990s, five new zoonotic viral diseases, Hendra, Nipah, Lyssa, Menangle and Melaka viruses have emerged from Pteropus species bats (Plowright et al., 2008). Even SARS can be linked to the horseshoe bats of the genus Rhinolophus.

In addition, they congregate in huge colonies close together and have a relatively long lifespan (Plowright et al., 2008). They are also old in evolutionary terms and therefore provide not only a huge melting pot within which viruses and other agents can be exchanged and mutated, but also maintained, even if they are fairly virulent strains. Their flying behaviour puts them into contact with many other species from the canopy of the forests to the ground, including rodents, monkeys, carnivores, birds, snakes and people thus creating an ideal environment for spill-over and spill-back of disease agents and also re-assortment of RNA. This combination of facts is probably why bats are so frequently associated with new diseases. The ingredients necessary for new diseases to emerge are thus close contact within a species (high population density), close contact between species and a rich biodiversity.",

However, even that would not cause pandemics. The other important factor playing a role in the emergence of these diseases is again translocation; with improved communication and movement of people (including ecotourism) and their animals, into and out of the rich biodiversity areas these diseases can now be spread more readily than ever before, particularly along trade routes, as has been the case with avian influenza (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2007). Rodents are also an important component of emerging diseases and, like bats, live in large colonies and in close contact and come into contact with many species. So the driving forces are again population density, contact and translocation. The role of arthropods in emerging diseases will be discussed below.",

            "text": "Today, wild animals are being condensed into increasingly smaller areas resulting in an increase in population densities within wild animal populations and increased opportunity for spread and maintenance of disease. An example of the effect of this man-induced concentration of wild animals is the spread of Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli 086:K61 amongst birds at feeding stations in Great Britain. In the USA the same situation has resulted in the emergence of Mycoplasma gallisepticum in bird populations. By creating an artificial intensified environment for birds, the increased opportunity for disease transmission has resulted in the emergence of these pathogens, which have the potential to cause illness in the human population (Daszak et al., 2000). The role that intensified farming systems are playing in emerging diseases is to amplify the virus or disease. In many of the diseases described above, the intermediate domestic animal host played this role by providing opportunity for multiple passaging and a mechanism for species shift or re-assortment of virus. When this is coupled to livestock movement the ingredients are there for an epidemic or pandemic to occur. A good example of this has been avian influenza, where the highly pathogenic strains have largely been traced back to domestic birds, usually farmed intensively, while low pathogenic strains of the virus are wide spread in wild birds. The weight of evidence suggests that the dispersion of avian influenza is primarily due to trading and movement of domestic birds rather than wild-bird migration (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2007). So, translocation remains the driving force for disease emergence, with intensification acting as the amplifier of the problem or the mechanism for a species shift.",

            "text": "Over the last twenty years the theory of global warming has become more and more widely accepted. Climatologists are predicting from their models that global mean temperatures are likely to rise by 1\u20133.5 \u00b0C during this century, with the main effects occurring in high latitudes during winter (Pastoret, 2000). This will result in changes in rainfall and wind patterns. So what does this mean in terms of emerging diseases? One of the main categories of diseases that are likely to be affected is vector-borne disease, because the effects of climate change are going to impact on the availability of habitat for the vectors and also as many of the vectors are cold blooded, they are much more susceptible to climate change than mammals. Climate change can thus be a two edged sword as there may be an increase in available habitat due to increased rainfall and higher humidity in some areas, but in other areas there may be a decrease in available habitat due to, for example, lower rainfalls and desertification. An increase may occur in vector-borne diseases in the higher latitudes and a decrease in them in the more central regions of the world. The effects are complex and warrant a separate paper. For example, most blood feeding groups of insects like blackflies (Simulidae), biting midges (Culicoides), horse flies (Tabanidae) and mosquitoes (Culicidae) have an aquatic or semi-aquatic stage in their lifecycle; hence changes in the availability of water to breed in will affect their survival. In addition, changes in wind patterns will affect dispersal of many flying insects, such as mosquitoes, sandflies (Phlebotominae) and midges (Culicoides). The effect of global warming then is therefore less likely to result in new emerging diseases, but more likely to result in changing distributions of diseases, with the high risk areas being the marginal areas where these vectors occur.",

The Rift Valley Fever outbreaks that occurred in East Africa in 1997 and 1998, which claimed the lives of thousands of livestock and wildlife and a good number of people, is thought to be due to an El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon that created precipitation in East Africa and amplified the mosquito vector population (Brown and Bolin, 2000).

At the same time there is often an increase in populations and a migration from rural areas, where people are in close contact with animals, to urban areas. This has resulted in an outstripping of community services such as potable water and sewerage disposal, thus creating an ideal environment for maintenance and propagation of enteric diseases such as Salmonellosis, E. coli's, Campylobacter (Thorns, 2000) and water borne pathogens such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium (Macpherson et al., 2000). Compounding this further is the poor immune status of these populations due to HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and environmental pollution. This has resulted in previously benign diseases such as toxoplasmosis and ringworm becoming life-threatening conditions (Gummow, 2003). In addition, these populations are often poorly educated about hygiene and health matters resulting in ideal opportunities for the spread and maintenance of diseases and the emergence of resistant strains of pathogens, such as tuberculosis, due to non-compliance to treatment. The socio-economic fabric of the society is therefore probably one of the biggest drivers of high impact emerging diseases that are in many ways more devastating than the more high profile wildlife-associated diseases (Fig. 2\n). The risk to the livestock sector is that many of these diseases can be reverse transmitted back into animal populations from these communities.",

The resulting diseases are just as erosive and dramatic as many of the infectious diseases that are popular in the media. We are only now beginning to appreciate the erosive effects of long-term exposures to metal and other inorganic pollutants as well as organic pollutants. Just as livestock has encroached into areas where wildlife occurs, so industry is increasingly encroaching into what were previously traditional farming areas. To illustrate the emergence of non-infectious diseases as a result of increased contact between industry and livestock as they compete for available resources the following examples are given: chronic copper poisoning in cattle in South Africa was an unknown entity prior to the 1990s (Gummow et al., 1991). Yet a significant outbreak of copper poisoning occurred amongst cattle near Palaborwa in 1989, which was also shown to be affecting the wildlife in Kruger National Park. The cause was traced back to aerial pollution from a mine in the area. Here a non-infectious emerging disease occurred in cattle for the first time in South Africa. In the 1990s calves in the Steelpoort area of Mpumalanga began wasting away and dying. The farmer was accused of poor management, but it turned out that his cattle were being exposed to vanadium coming from a nearby smelter that was contaminating the grazing. Vanadium poisoning in calves proved to be a new emerging disease in cattle (Gummow et al, 1994). In Russia the life expectancy of human males dropped from 65 to 57 between 1987 and 1994, probably as a result of exposure to decades of environmental contaminants (WRI/UNDP/WB, 1996). In the USA, air pollution is thought to be responsible for around 50 000 deaths a year, which is 2% of their total deaths (Thurston, 1995). This is a sobering thought as we begin to become aware of the impact of pollutants on animal and human health. Many pollution-related emerging diseases are only now recognised, described and understood.",

However, new diagnostic methodologies facilitate the identification of the diseases and the driving forces.

The main challenge is recognising the complexity of emerging diseases and identifying the key determinants.
