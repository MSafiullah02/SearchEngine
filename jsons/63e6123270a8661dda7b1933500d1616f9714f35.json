(1) where summarised to the host taxonomic order level, retaining unique combinations of virus species with each of the reservoir orders included in the primary analysis. These host-virus interactions were added to the list of known reservoir-virus interactions before repeating the analyses described in the main text. Because the dataset of (1) did not contain avian hosts, these were removed from the reservoir data, although results were similar when including them. The top 30 models ranked by AIC are shown in (A), with rows representing individual models and columns representing variables. The effects present in the top model are illustrated in panels B -F, with lines indicating the predicted effect of the variable on the x-axis, when keeping all other variables at their mean observed value, and shaded regions indicating the 95% confidence interval of this prediction. Points illustrate partial residuals. Effects whose 95% confidence interval cross 0 over the entire range of the predictor variable are shaded in grey.",
