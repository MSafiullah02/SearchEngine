There is a constant need for information as new organisms emerge, existing ones develop resistance to current drugs or vaccines and there are changes in epidemiology and prevalence. In the twenty-first century, obtaining this information has never been more important. Population migration, and the relatively low cost of flying, means that unfamiliar infectious diseases may be brought into industrialised countries. An example of this was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first recognised in 2003. Despite modern technology and a huge input of money, it took months for the agent to be identified, a diagnostic test to be produced, and a strategy for disease reporting and isolation to be established.",

Challenges ensued with decisions about treatment and then the distribution and administration of specific vaccine.",

First, managing detainees or police personnel who have contracted a disease and may be infectious or unwell, and second, handling complainants of assault, including police officers, who have potentially been exposed to an infectious \u00addisease. The latter can be distressing for those involved, compounded in part from an inconsistency of management guidelines, if indeed they exist.",

Therefore, it is prudent to pre-empt such situations before the consultation begins by obtaining either written or verbal consent from the detainee to allow certain pieces of information to be disclosed. If they do not agree, then the doctor must decide whether withholding relevant details will endanger the lives or health of those working within custody or others with whom they may have had close contact (whether or not deliberate).

There were also serious outbreaks of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in hospitals in New York City and Miami [76]. Factors pertinent to the overall upswing included the emergence of HIV, the increasing numbers of immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, and perhaps more significantly, the stopping of categorical federal funding for control activities in 1972. The latter led to a failure of the public health infrastructure for TB control. Since 1992, the trend has reversed as the CDC transferred most of its funds to tuberculosis surveillance and treatment programmes in states and large cities. From 1992 to 2001, the annual decline averaged by 7.3% [77], but the following year this was reduced to 2%, indicating that there was no room for complacency. The WHO has been proactive and redirecting funding to those countries most in need. In October 1998, a global partnership called Stop TB was launched to co-ordinate every aspect of TB control, and by 2002, the partnership had over 150 member states.

It may take weeks or months before \u00addisease becomes apparent or infection may remain dormant for years before reactivation in later life especially if the person becomes debilitated or immunocompromised. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of cases of TB in immunocompetent people pass unnoticed. Of reported cases, 75% involve the lung, while non-respiratory (e.g. bone, heart, kidney, brain) or dissemination (miliary TB) are more common in immigrant ethnic groups and the immunocompromised [78]. They are also more likely to develop resistant strains. In the general population, there is an estimated 10% lifetime risk of tuberculosis infection progressing to disease [79].",

By the end of June 2003, 8,422 cases had been reported from 31 different countries with a total of 916 deaths. Approximately 92% of cases occurred in China (including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). The case fatality rate varied from <1% in people less than 24 years old, 6% in persons aged 25\u201344, 15% in the 44\u201364 years age group and >50% in persons 65 or older. On 5 July 2003, the WHO reported that the last human chain of transmission of SARS had been broken and lifted the ban from all countries. However, they warned that everyone should remain vigilant, as resurgence of SARS was still a possibility and this indeed proved the case with reports ongoing until May 2004. Since then, there have been no further reported cases. Knowledge about the epidemiology and ecology of SARS-CoV and the disease remains limited; however, the experience gained from the previous outbreak enabled the disease to be contained rapidly \u2013 reflected in the few cases reported since December.
