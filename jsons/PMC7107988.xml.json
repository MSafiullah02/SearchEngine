            "text": "Our key finding is that acute middle ear infection is a coinfection with bacteria and viruses in the majority of young patients. Previously, 10 studies have reported concomitant detection of bacteria and viruses from MEF samples of patients with AOM [3, 4, 16\u201323]. The rates of coinfections have varied between 5% and 27%, compared with 66% in this study. On the other hand, we were able to specify etiology in 96% of cases, compared with the 59%\u201385% of the previous studies. This discrepancy is explained by the microbiological methods used rather than by the characteristics of the study populations. The traditional method of viral diagnostics is culture, which has low sensitivity, especially for picornaviruses. Yoshie [24], in the early 1950s, was the first to show viruses in the middle ear by culturing influenza A viruses from MEF specimens obtained from 4 patients. This was followed by the studies of Berglund et al. [25, 26] in Turku, who cultured respiratory syncytial virus from MEF and showed that viruses and bacteria may coexist in an acute middle ear infection. Since then, the etiology of AOM has had 3 possibilities: bacterial infection, viral infection, or coinfection [27]. The landmark study of Henderson et al. [28], showing a clear association of viral upper respiratory tract infection with otitis media, as well as the availability of antigen detection, boosted investigations into viral etiology of AOM. Klein et al. [16] reported viral antigens in 23% of AOM cases and coinfection with bacteria and viruses in 8% of patients. Comparable rates were presented by the successors of Berglund from our center [17]. Chonmaitree and colleagues [3, 19, 20] detected coinfection in almost 20% of patients with AOM, but this was due to a better bacterial yield, not to a higher rate of findings of viruses. The advent of PCR enabled Pitk\u00e4ranta et al. [4] to double the rate of detection of viruses, which increased the proportion of coinfections up to 27%, although they sought only 3 common viruses in MEF. The chain of these studies confirms that viral detection techniques are of fundamental importance, as was pointed out in early reviews of the role of viruses as etiologic agents of otitis media [27, 29]. Our study is the first to use a variety of sensitive methods to identify a broad spectrum of bacteria and viruses. As a consequence, this study strongly suggests that acute middle ear infections in young children are mainly coinfections with bacteria and viruses.",

Viruses are recovered more frequently from MEF specimens from patients with infections unresponsive to antimicrobials than from MEF specimens from unselected patients with AOM [30]. A plausible explanation could be that concentrations of antimicrobials in MEF may be lower in coinfections than in infections due solely to bacteria [31]. Furthermore, viruses strengthen the bacteria-induced inflammation in the middle ear, which is evident by the higher concentrations of inflammatory mediators in coinfections than in cases of AOM due solely to bacteria [21]. Thus, viruses do not seem to be \u201cinnocent bystanders\u201d in the middle ear. Of interest, in other respiratory tract infections as well, concomitant detection of bacteria and viruses is related to more severe symptoms and/or poorer therapeutic responses than are seen in infections due either solely to bacteria or solely to viruses [32, 33]. Our findings suggest that coinfection with bacteria and viruses in the middle ear may be a more common cause for a poor treatment response in AOM than previously thought [19].",

            "text": "Typical AOM bacteria could be cultured in 73% of our cases, comparable to rates in populations with AOM with an intact tympanic membrane [1]. The use of PCR revealed that more than one-half of our patients with initially negative culture results actually harbored bacteria in their middle ears. Thus, AOM bacteria were found in 86% of children. Del Beccaro et al. [34] have achieved comparable results by using broth subcultures in addition to conventional culture. In young children with acute tube otorrhea, AOM bacteria have been previously found in 45%\u201362% of cases [2, 35, 36]. In our population, both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were rare findings, as expected, considering the young age group and the exclusion of summer months [2, 35]. An equally important explanation, however, may be the true acute nature of the infection, lasting in most of our cases for <24 h before sampling. The previous surveys reporting high prevalences of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa have included patients with prolonged otorrhea lasting as long as 3 weeks [36]. Furthermore, in all previous studies, specimens were collected by swabbing the ear canal, in contrast to the direct visually controlled MEF suctioning through the tube in the present study. Brook et al. [37] have convincingly shown that the sampling technique affects the rate and spectrum of bacteria; thus, specimen collection from the ear canal may give misleading results. This gives further support to our finding that, although the presence of the tympanostomy tube alters the physiological conditions of the middle ear, the patent tube does not change the etiology of AOM in young children.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses were demonstrated in 70% of our patients. Earlier studies have emphasized respiratory syncytial virus in the etiology of AOM. However, these studies have used only viral culture and/or antigen detection, and overall positivity rates for viruses have been modest (10%\u201324%) [16, 17, 20, 21, 38]. Use of PCR techniques has revealed the significance of picornaviruses in AOM [4, 22, 39]. We found rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in 42% of patients, and 60% of all findings of viruses were picornaviruses. Picornaviruses were the most frequent findings even during respiratory syncytial virus season, as also shown by Nokso-Koivisto et al. [39]. This suggests that the overall high prevalence of picornaviruses could raise rhinoviruses and enteroviruses to be the leading viral etiologic agents of AOM, although the relative rate of respiratory syncytial virus as a predisposer to AOM is important [38]. However, differences in the sensitivity of the viral detection methods may hamper the situation. In our study, the children were an average of 6 months older than in the studies described above that included children with intact tympanic membranes. This may have decreased detection rates of respiratory syncytial virus, although our sample collection period covered the whole respiratory season. To draw a complete picture of viral infections in AOM, future studies should use viral detection methods of equal sensitivity for each virus and collect the samples at least during 1 fall-winter-spring period.",
