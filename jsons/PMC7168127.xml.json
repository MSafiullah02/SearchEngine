The less virulent viruses srr7 virus (srr7)1 and Mu\u20103 virus (Mu\u20103)2, 3 have been isolated from cl\u20102 and srr7, respectively. Most mice infected with srr7 survive for 8 days after infection. The viral antigens are predominantly detected in the white matter, and neurons are not infected.1, 4, 5 The virulence of Mu\u20103 is intermediate between that of cl\u20102 and srr7, showing a mixed pattern of the neuropathologies of cl\u20102 and srr7.6 The viral antigens are detected in both the white matter and neurons.3 Typical neuropathological change observed in the mice infected with Mu\u20103, and not with cl\u20102 or srr7, was apoptosis\u2010induced in the CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus at 4 days post\u2010inoculation (dpi). In spite of these differences in virulence and neuropathological findings, the viruses exhibit a similar pattern of viral spread during the initial phase of infection. Between 12 and 24 hpi, viral antigens are detected only in the meninges, followed by viral spread into the ventricular wall at 24 to 48 hpi before invasion into the brain parenchyma, indicating that the viruses use a passage between the meninges and ventricular wall as an entry route into the brain parenchyma.3, 4, 5\n",

The ERfibs in the lymphoid organs have collagen fibers as a core, which is wrapped in an ERag\u2010rich matrix, and further by the laminin\u2010rich basement membrane at the outermost surface.11, 14 These components in lymph nodes are produced by the stromal cells, which include FRCs, lymphatic endothelial cells, blood endothelial cells and contractile pericytes.13 In the brain, especially in the brain parenchyma, we propose that astrocytes play a central role, like FRCs in the lymphoid organs, in ERag\u2010positive reticular formation after infection, because we found that astrocytes produce the main components of ERfibs, such as ERag, laminin and collagen, in response to viral invasion.",

This effect may be due to physical stress during cell preparation for culture, because physical treatment causes an increase in ERag in vivo.\n18 However, the fibrous extracellular structure of ERag was not as clear in the uninfected culture as in the JHMV cl2\u2010infected culture (Fig. 1B\u2013F) and a deposition of bulky ERag+ fibers was found to surround the infected areas (Fig. 1B). Thus, the expression levels of ERag were increased in the infected culture when analyzed by the average fluorescence intensity (AFI) (Fig. 2). Immature forms of ERfibs, detected in vivo\n7 as solitary ERag expression without an association with other components of ECM such as laminin and collagen, were also observed in the brain mix culture. Especially, the co\u2010localization of ERfibs and laminin+ fibers occurred infrequently (Fig. 1C). Also, a large population of laminin\u2010producing cells was found to surround a small cluster of ERag\u2010producing cells, whereas there were only a few laminin\u2010producing cells in the areas with a large cluster of ERag\u2010producing cells (Fig. 1D). In addition, laminin was found to be extracellularly secreted to form a sheet\u2010like structure, which was observed when an image was taken in different focal planes (Fig. 1E4). In the deepest plane (Fig. 1E1) among the images shown in Figure 1E, laminin expression is not prominent except for as a partial colocalization with the bold ERfib indicated by long arrows. At a position 2 \u03bcm above the image shown in Figure 1E1, ERag\u2212 laminin+ sheets (Fig. 1E3), with small\u2010diameter holes (short arrows) compared with the size of the nucleus (Fig. 1E2), appeared to cover underlying ERfibs. The ERag\u2212 laminin+ sheets showed a lace curtain structure hanging from the mature ERag+ laminin+ ERfibs (arrows in Fig. 1E1\u20133). In contrast, collagen fibers were associated with ERfibs more closely (Fig. 1F) than laminin. Furthermore, an area of clustered cells that produced both collagen and ERag was observed (Fig. 1G).",

ERag appeared in the brain parenchymal area close to the meninx or ventricle (Fig. 3B), and was found at a distance from the viral antigens (arrows in Fig. 3B1, B2), as we previously reported.7 However, laminin expression was observed in wider areas compared with ERag expression, with fine fibrous structures in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 3C1\u20133). The colocalization of laminin and GFAP was observed in the areas near the meninges and ventricle (Fig. 3C3\u20135), where structures of blood vessels were accompanied by laminin expression (Fig. C3). Some of them were wrapped by laminin\u2010positive (La+) astrocytic fibers (Fig. 3C3, C4), but many were free of La+ foot process of astrocytes at a low magnification (Fig. 3C3). However La+ GFAP+ dot\u2010like structures on the outer surface of blood vessels were noted at a higher magnification (Fig. 3C5).",

The co\u2010localization of GFAP and ColI or ColIII was clearly detected apart from in the structures of blood vessels (Fig. 3D,E).

In order to answer this, we focused on the expression of IFN\u03b2, a type I interferon, among several cytokines. Reportedly, MHV infection in vitro inhibits IFN\u03b2 production, although the level of IFN\u03b2 is elevated in the brain after infection with neuropathogenic MHV strains.19, 20 A reason for this discrepancy was clarified by our in vivo study. The infected cells in the ventricle and ventricular wall during the early phase of infection did not produce IFN\u03b2, but the cells surrounding the infected cells did (Fig. 6A1). Furthermore, deep in the brain parenchymal area of the pons where no viral antigens were detected, IFN\u03b2\u2010positive cells were found (Fig. 6A2). How did these cells, away from the infected site, get the information on infection? We propose that astrocytes form an astrocytic reticular network (ARN), which creates a conduit system in a similar fashion to FRN found in lymphoid organs, by producing ECMs including ERag, a maker of FRN.21 In support of this, a fine astrocytic network was found to surround the IFN\u03b2\u2010producing cells deep in the pontine parenchyma (Fig. 6B), where no viral antigens are found during the early phase of infection,4, 7 and tissue destruction has yet to occur (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, spotty ERag+ areas were connected by astrocytic foot processes (Fig. 6C).",

In addition, we showed that the neuro\u2010virulent viruses can induce the production of ECMs other than ERag in the brain parenchymal cells, especially astrocytes, producing major components of mature ERfibs including ERag, laminin and Col. Studies in vivo on the later phase of infection at 72 hpi, where an enhanced expression of ECM in the brain appeared compared with that in the earlier phase, enable us to see more clearly that the areas of laminin expression were more widely spread than the ERag\u2010positive areas, compared with our previous study.7 Although the interaction of astrocytic laminin and surrounding conditions, mainly in the areas of the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB),22, 23, 24 or in the developmental brain,25 has been studied, the interaction of laminin and ERag expression has not been clarified, because astrocytic ERag production has not been reported except in our previous study.7 The earlier production of laminin by astrocytes prior to ERag expression7 might have stimulated ERag production through autocrine effects on the function of astrocytes, because astrocytic laminin is necessary for some of their functions, shown by the fact that a lack of the laminin \u03b12 subunit produced by astrocytes induces hypertrophic endfeet of astrocytes and obstructs appropriate polarization of aquaporin 4 expressed on astrocytes in the BBB.22 Furthermore, the modulation and organization of astrocytic laminin levels mediate glia\u2010neuronal commitment.23 Another possibility is that astrocytic laminin restricts ERag expression, leading to narrower areas of ERag expression compared with laminin\u2010positive areas. Astrocytic laminin prevents the differentiation of pericytes, which have been shown to express ERag in the brain after infection,7 from the resting stage to contractile stage.24 It is noteworthy that the contractile pericytes are one of the ERag\u2010producing cell types in lymph nodes.13\n",

The ERfibs in the lymphid organs have collagen fibers as a core that are wrapped by ERag\u2010positive ECM, and finally surrounded by laminin at the outermost surface.26 The findings in the primary cultures indicated the process of forming mature ERfibs in the brain. That is, immediately after the secretion of collagen and ERag from astrocytes, or before the secretion, they form intimate contact with each other, and form a fibrous structure. Subsequently, the fibers are packed in the astrocytic laminin prepared in the form of a membranous sheet structure.",

The finding that they did not detect astrocytic Col in vivo using immunofluorescence, which led to their interpretation of why previous neuroscientists had concluded that the brain is the only organ that lacks fibrillary elements such as collagen fibers,28 corresponds to our previous report7 that showed ColIII expression was low\u2010level in the brain except for the meninges and ventricles during the early phase of infection.

A limitation to detect a small amount of ECM using the available techniques ,including a light microscopical approach, had led to the misinterpretation by neuroscientists as Heck et al. pointed out and as described earlier.28 The reticular fiber that comprises the FRN in the lymph nodes is around 1 \u03bcm in diameter.26 We detected the fine network of astrocytic fibers and ERfibs only at a high magnification of a confocal laser scanning microscope, which has insufficient resolution to trace the initial conduit that transfers the message of viral invasion deep into the brain parenchyma. One thin line of ERfib might function as a conduit to activate astrocytes deep in the parenchyma after the recognition of viral invasion at the ventricular wall or brain surface facing the arachnoid membrane. Although it is important for medical treatment to handle an initial immune response after infection in the brain, little is known about how the immune network is constructed in the brain.

C: Long arrows indicate blood vessels surrounded by astrocytes with ERag expression (C1), which do not show any connection with one another in the image with ERag\u2010staining alone (C2). The areas with low expression levels of GFAP or ERag indicated by boxed areas in C1 with an arrowhead and short arrows are shown at higher magnifications in C3 and C4, respectively, which revealed that ERag expression near (C4) and away from blood vessels (C3) is connected with fine networks of astrocytic fibers. Single and double bars indicate 100 and 20 \u03bcm, respectively.",
