The Mas receptor is activated by Ang(1\u20137) but the intracellular signaling pathway is not well understood. The receptor function is usually associated with Ang II-dependent effects and is known to counter the AT1-dependent signaling. Ang(1\u20137)/Mas activation inhibits the AT1-dependent activation of MAPK kinase in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules. In cardiovascular epithelium of mammals, Mas receptor activation stimulates phosphorylation of AKT and increases endothelial NO synthesis, leading to vasorelaxation that counters the vasoconstriction effects of Ang II. A combination of angiotensin signaling has been recently noticed, which states that the physiological effect depends not only on a single pathway, but is a result of a specific ratio among various angiotensins, acting through their own receptor pathways. Renal mesangial cell proliferation was stimulated by Ang II and Ang(1\u20137) independently via AT1 and Mas receptors respectively [4]. However, a combination of stimulatory concentration of Ang II and Ang(1\u20137) counters the stimulation, indicating the complex interaction within RAS signaling. AT4/IRAP activates intracellular signals including an increase in intracellular Ca concentration, modulation of MAPK kinases, activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, and production of cGMP. However, the effects are largely dependent on the cell types and, in some cases, no classical signaling could be demonstrated despite the presence of AT4 binding sites.",

Intra-arterial injection of Ang III or Ang IV increases blood pressure in teleosts but Ang III has a higher potency than Ang IV. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Ang III increases the heart rate without affecting the blood pressure and ventilation rate in trout, in contrast to the effect of Ang II, which increases all three parameters [3]. ICV injection of Ang IV does not affect blood pressure, heart rate, and ventilation rate even though it is detected in the brain by immunoassays. This suggested that a specific receptor for Ang III (and Ang II) could be present to elicit the preferential effect of heart rate control in trout [8]. The Mas receptor expresses in brain, testis, ovary, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. Besides AT2, the Ang(1\u20137)/Mas receptor axis is also known to antagonize the effects of the AT1 axis. These antagonistic effects include anti-hypertrophic action, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic effects, and vasodilation via stimulation of NO synthesis in endothelium and potentiation of the bradykinin effect. The localization and physiological effects of the Mas receptor are not clear in non-mammalian vertebrates. AT4/IRAP is broadly distributed in kidney, aorta, heart, liver, lung, uterus, adrenal gland, and brain, especially in neurons associated with memory function [9]. The Ang IV/AT4 axis is involved in facilitation of memory and can reverse memory deficits caused by alcohol abuse and ischemia. AT4 antagonist decreases renal blood flow and increases urinary sodium excretion, and these effects are independent of the AT1 pathway. The large variation in signaling and function of AT4 poses difficulties for researchers. Ang IV was detected in considerable amounts in the brain of trout, indicating a possible role of memory function as in the case of mammals. There is so far no information on AT4/IRAP in non-mammalian vertebrates.",
