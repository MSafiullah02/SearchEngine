We base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease, including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high-and low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full-and partial-quarantine scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.",

Our model accounts for different phases of the disease, potential aquisition of the herd immunity,multiple groups in the populations, and the interaction between individuals belonging to various groups. Our model treats the health system as given and accounts for such aspects as the availability of extra hospital beds and intensive care units (ICU) to accommodate the pent-up demand due to the pandemic. We use the most recent research data to calibrate the model. The model allows simulating lockdowns and quarantines of each specific group and the response of different groups to mandatory social behavior in public.",

At the same time, the health system can expand to manage the additional patient load. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a Kgroup version of the basic Kermack-McKendrick model with a generic preferred mixing matrix. We specify the model for the most important case of two groups (the high-risk and low-risk groups) in Section 3. An a priori choice of the model parameters is hard to accomplish because the actual number of people infected by the virus is unknown due to the prevalence of asymptomatic cases. To address this problem, we do \"implied\" calibration of the model by choosing parameters in such a way that observable quantities, such as the number of hospitalizations, including ICU admissions, and, deaths rates are reproduced with reasonable accuracy. This calibration is described in Section 4. In Section 5 we formulate and graphically illustrate our main results. We draw our main conclusions in Section 6.",

Depending on the particulars of the disease under consideration, one can use either susceptible-infected-removed (SIR), or susceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR), or a more complex model. The salient features of COVID-19, however, make it imperative to use a more advanced version of the model, which, at the very least, should account for two groups of susceptibles -a high-risk group, and a low-risk group, see, e.g., [4] . This separation is a must because the average mortality rate, which is of the order of 0.4 percent or so, see, [10] , is not a good representation of actual mortality, which is manifestly bimodal. Besides, the model should involve the all-important feedback loop, which accounts for the fact that mortality increases when the demand for intensive care outstrips its supply so that rationing becomes inevitable and results in elevated mortality.",

If the capacity of the health system is large enough, and the number of hospital or ICU beds is at or above the threshold level, then no quarantine is required. If the number of ICU beds is below the threshold, then quarantine of the HR population only can allow the country to slow the spread of disease and flatten the curve. In the meantime, the LR group can support the economy while maintaining pandemic interventions. ",
