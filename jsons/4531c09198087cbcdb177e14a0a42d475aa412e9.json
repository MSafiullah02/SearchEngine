For these patients, particularly those who are hospitalized, ten-fraction treatment increases the risks for patients and staff exposure to SARS-COV-2. Thus, while several dose options are available, though we favor 20 Gy in 5 fractions, which has been safely used in multiple studies (23, 24) . Standard fractionation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) with memantine could be considered for patients in whom longer term survival is expected, in order limit neurocognitive complications (25) . In patients with limited prognosis, the QUARTZ study demonstrated similar rates of overall survival and quality of life with steroids and best supportive care alone as compared to whole brain radiation therapy (26) , and therefore observation is likely preferred to limit unnecessary exposure to SARS-COV-2.",

While there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of single-fraction radiotherapy for spinal cord compression, particularly given that the SCORAD III study did not meet its prespecified non-inferiority endpoints even though the absolute difference of ambulatory status at 8 weeks was small (69.3% in the single-fraction group vs. 72.7% in the multifraction group). However, 8 Gy x 1 provides acceptable rates of palliation and allows for safe retreatment with either conventionally fractionated or SBRT approaches if warranted.

This \"Quad Shot\" regimen has also been effective in head and neck malignancies (35) . Due to potential increased risk of nosocomial SARS-COV2 exposure, our center has recommended limiting treatment of COVID-confirmed or suspicious cases to a single treatment machine at the end of the day to facilitate disinfection and risk reduction procedures. As such, it may be logistically preferable to avoid twice-daily treatments and instead, favor 4 Gy x 5 as an alternative. week apart may offer logistical advantages, particularly for inpatients who may be discharged after the first fraction, we felt that this must be balanced with concerns for spinal cord toxicity, especially in patients with prior radiation treatments and those who may need future treatments.",

For patients with metastatic cancer, prognosis must first be clearly estimated and communicated with the patient, followed by a goals of care conversation. Data from China suggests that 40% of patients with active cancer diagnoses required either intubation or died, although the authors report that they are only presenting a small sample size, and acknowledge the presence of other comorbidities such as age, and smoking history (9) . Patients who have prognostic awareness are less likely to choose and therefore receive aggressive oncologic treatments in the last month of life (43) . As such, these patients may opt for medical supportive care. For patients suitable and requiring palliative RT, abbreviated courses of treatment is of particular importance to reduce the risk of viral exposure to all patients and staff, without compromising functional outcomes. Furthermore, as staffing and clinical treatment capacity remains at risk for fluctuation, abbreviated RT courses better allow for treatment completion without delay. Fortunately, there is high-level evidence supporting these courses for oncologic emergencies to maximize patient benefit and resource allocation. As such, hypofractionated regimens for palliative radiation are preferred to reduce risk and maximize benefit for both individuals and the population during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
