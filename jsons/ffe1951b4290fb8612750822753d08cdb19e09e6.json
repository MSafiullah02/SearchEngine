Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappa B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID 19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of Ddimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes.",

ARDS is caused by lung inflammation and increased alveolar endothelial and epithelial permeabilities 30 resulting in a protein-rich pulmonary edema with severe hypoxemia and impaired carbon dioxide excretion 31 . The lung injury is primarily due to neutrophil-dependent and platelet-dependent damage to the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lung, frequently caused by pneumonia 31 Neutrophils can become activated, leading to the release of toxic mediators including reactive oxygen species (ROS), proinflammatory cytokines and procoagulant molecules 31 , where further synergistic interaction with platelets increase damage to the lungs 32 . A procoagulant effect with coagulopathy and anti-phospholipid antibodies has recently been reported in patients with Covid-19 33 , and these abnormal coagulation parameters have been shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) 34 . It is therefore important to find ways to decrease free radical oxidative stress (ROS), high levels of inflammatory cytokines and procoagulant pathways triggered by COVID-19 if we are to impact the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with the disease process.",

This would include the constellation of early prodromal symptoms of anosmia, hyposmia, and dysgeusia, along with a fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath. There are very few diseases that cause a sudden loss or decreased sense of smell and/or taste. According to the medical literature, approximately 5% of people exhibit functional anosmia primarily caused by senescence 36 , where 25% of people above the age of 50 have an impaired sense of smell 37 38 . Olfactory health can be a measure of the number of medications taken 39 , and also directly reflect the overall health of a person, where lowered olfactory abilities seem to be negatively associated with life expectancy and an increased risk of death 40 .

Zincdeficiency can lead to an increased susceptibility to a variety of pathogens 62 , and zinc supplementation in healthy human subjects has been shown to lower oxidative stress related byproducts 63 , inhibit induction of TNF alpha and interleukin 1 beta 64 , protect against TNF-\u03b1-induced nuclear factor-\u03ba\u03b2 activation in isolated mononuclear cells 64 and regulate intracellular killing and cytokine production by macrophages 64 . In the immune system, the major role of vitamin C appears to be as an antioxidant, protecting the lungs and host cells against oxidative stress caused by infections 65 as well as helping to increase phagocyte function, the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and the production of interferon, while decreasing the replication of viruses 66 67 . In one study, Vitamin C was shown to shorten the length of the stay in the ICU and decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients on respirators 68 . Finally, Beta glucans have been extensively published in the medical literature as having significant immunomodulatory properties 69 and double blind, placebo controlled trials have shown benefit in decreasing the severity of upper respiratory tract infections and lowering monocyte chemotactic protein-1 70 71 . For that reason, controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and/or nutraceuticals including zinc, vitamin C and Beta glucans are needed to evaluate their effects for both prevention and diminishing the severity of clinical symptomatology post exposure. This is critically important since development of a safe and effective vaccine may be months to years away, and effective antiviral approaches could help flatten the curve and prevent infection. Randomized controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine, and or ivermectin, with or without the nutraceuticals zinc, vitamin C, and Beta glucans could be done in association with screening questionnaires/app's, to potentially detect early symptoms, monitor the clinical course from a distance without using precious hospital resources and upload treatment data to the cloud for large data computing, expediting results.",

An initial non-randomized small study done in France by Raoult et al showed benefit using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 56 and results of a larger clinical trial are pending. Other potential treatments being considered are ivermectin 61 , nitazoxanide 74 , remdesivir 75 , as well as repurposed drugs and nutritional supplements including but not limited to melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus 76 . Since none of these have yet undergone randomized, clinical trials, and no FDA treatments for COVID-19 are yet available, collecting data via an app and online questionnaire in those patients who have used these drug combinations 'off label' could be useful in directing clinical research.",

The transcription factor NF-\u03baB regulates multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immune functions, is a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses, induces the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes, including those encoding cytokines and chemokines, and also participates in inflammasome regulation 80 Inhibitors to block NFKappaB signaling include N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 82 , alpha lipoic acid 83 , as well as antioxidants like glutathione 84 . N-acetylcysteine and alpha lipoic acid can help increase production and regeneration of glutathione 85 86 , and deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been found in ARDS 35 , as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias 87 , resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress 88 . A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappaB and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) as well as PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation 89 90 . The efficacy of glutathione therapy in rapidly relieving dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia was recently reported by Horowitz and Freeman in a peer-reviewed journal (under review). Since the Nrf2 pathway plays a pivotal role in inflammation 91 as does the NF-\u03baB pathway and deficiencies in glutathione, these should be explored as part of a multifaceted approach to find effective treatments for COVID-19.",

Prevention is especially important since the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that hundreds of thousands of deaths will occur worldwide 96 , with the WHO estimating a global mortality rate greater than 5% 12 . Innovative solutions that have a low risk and high potential yield therefore require scientific validation. A three-part prevention, diagnostic and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with hydroxychloroquine and/or ivermetin as well as other medications and nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NFKappaB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC, including anticoagulation with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil for those requiring respiratory support. These three hypothetical broad-based clinical interventions have been published in the medical literature to be of potential benefit in those with viral pneumonia and ARDS, with limited data available on their effects on COVID-19. We believe that it is urgent that these hypotheses be tested in a series of randomized, controlled trials to evaluate their ability to flatten the curve and decrease the presently high levels of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.",

There was also a significant association between both disorders of anosmia and dysgeusia (p < 0.001). Using olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS) can therefore be useful as an initial screening tool 43 especially when it is linked to a questionnaire evaluating the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19. The likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 when there is a sudden change in smell and taste during the present pandemic is of high probability, especially when other risk factors and medical diseases have been ruled out. Regarding the sudden loss or decreased sensation of taste, infectious diseases including upper respiratory viral infection, oral cavity infection, or viral hepatitis, frequently develop taste abnormalities",
