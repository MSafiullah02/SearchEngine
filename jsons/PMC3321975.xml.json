It has since been detected worldwide (2\u20137), including the People\u2019s Republic of China (8), but whether it is a causative respiratory pathogen remains speculative. To investigate the potential role of WUPyV in respiratory diseases and its prevalence in Tianjin, China, we examined samples obtained from children with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) by using PCR for the VP2 and LTAg genes, as described previously (1). As a control, we also tested samples from patients who did not have respiratory diseases.",

Variation may be due to different geographic and age distributions of the virus. Another study reported that frequencies of WUPyV in URTIs (6.7%) and LRTIs cases (7.1%) were comparable (10). However, we found the incidence of WUPyV in patients with LRTIs (16.1%) was higher than in patients with URTIs (4.4%). Among WUPyV-infected patients with LRTIs, 71.4% were <1 year of age, which was comparable to populations investigated in other studies (2,3,6). Although \u224860% of outpatients with URTIs were >5 years of age, none was WUPyV positive. This finding suggests WUPyV may play a major role in young children, especially infants, with LRTIs.",
