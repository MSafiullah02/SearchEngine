The observed case fatality ratio increased slightly over this time period, reflecting a change in the age distribution of the cases.

As data accrue, the case fatality ratio can be obtained more precisely by using the point estimate and associated 95 percent confidence interval and compared with estimates obtained from parametric cure models (14) . Throughout the epidemic, analyses should be undertaken to test the sensitivity of estimates to variations in case definition and ascertainment as well as to test for the significance of case mix (for example, by age).
