To the knowledge of these authors, there have only been two reports of the possibility of influenza in any reptile-filamentous influenza C in Nile crocodiles on a farm in South Africa (Huchzermeyer, 2003) and influenza A and B in snakes of the genera Bothrops and Crotalus (Mancini et al., 2004) . To date, no study has been carried out specifically to detect influenza viruses in crocodilians. It is feasible to ask, however, whether crocodilian species might carry influenza viruses for a number of reasons. First, among the vertebrates, the crocodilians are most closely related to birds and they share a number of anatomical and behavioral similarities (Sues, '89) . Secondly, many crocodilian species live in the same aquatic ecosystems as the wild birds that harbor influenza A viruses. Finally, birds often serve as a significant food source for many crocodilians (Pooley, '89; Elsey et al., 2004; Gabrey and Elsey, 2008) . Captive crocodilians in open pens are reported to consume wild birds opportunistically on a regular basis (J. Brueggen and T. Cullen, personal communication).",

This is in part because of the difficulty in developing appropriate tests as well as insufficient knowledge of the conditions under which viruses should be studied in ectotherms (Nevarez, 2007) . It is possible that many undiagnosed pathologies in crocodilians may be caused by viruses. In spite of this, a number of viral infections have been reported in crocodilian species including caiman pox, crocodile pox, adenoviral infections, paramyxovirus, eastern encephalitis, coronavirus and influenza C (Huchzermeyer, 2003) . Other studies have demonstrated West Nile virus (WNV) infections in farmed American alligators in the United States (Miller et al., 2003; Jacobson et al., 2005a; Nevarez et al., 2005) . It is worthy of note that the majority of the documented cases of viral infections involve crocodilians residing in captive situations. The filamentous influenza C virus found by transmission electron microscopy in Nile crocodiles occurred on a farm in South Africa where the crocodiles were held in high stress environments (Huchzermeyer, 2003) . Overstocking, handling, and temperature fluctuations may have been the indirect contributors to the high mortality observed on this farm, though the animals were also housed in the vicinity of ostriches that had been diagnosed with H5N1. The direct cause of mortality in the Nile crocodiles was not determined.",

Sample collection involved several methods: placing blood in RNAlater s solution ($1:1), placing blood in empty tubes (no anticoagulant), swirling a cloacal swab (Dacron s tip with plastic shaft) in RNAlater s solution and swirling a cloacal swab in 1 \u00c2 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Samples were prepared by adding 100 mL of cloacal swab material to 300 mL of brain-heart infusion broth and 100 mL of antibiotic mix for a final concentration of 1,000 U/mL penicillin G, 20 mg/mL amphotericin B and 100 mg/mL gentamycin and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr.

Clean sequence was only obtained from two samples for the NS gene-001 fresh blood and 013 fresh blood. For sample 001, a BLAST search yielded a 99.7% match (684/686 bp) to influenza A virus (A/bluewinged teal/LA/3B/88(H4N8)) nonstructural protein gene. Sequencing of sample 013 yielded a BLAST match of 100% (444/444 bp) to influenza A virus (A/black duck/New York/184/1988(H5N2)) nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes.

The flyways of many migratory waterfowl and shore birds that harbor the influenza A viruses extend into the natural range of the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) in the United States and into the territories of other crocodilian species in other parts of the world. The American alligator exists in abundance in the southeastern portion of the United States, extending from as far west as Texas and Arkansas to Florida, South Carolina and up into North Carolina. The Atlantic, Mississippi and Central flyways cover this area. Within these flyways a number of ducks, geese, shorebirds and other birds migrate from their wintering habitats in northern climates to the breeding grounds in southern regions (www.flywayfoundation.org). Given that both eyewitness accounts and stomach contents surveys have revealed that wild and captive alligators are known to eat wild birds including mottled ducks and blue-winged teal (Elsey et al., 2004; Gabrey and Elsey, 2008) , it is feasible to think that some animals may ingest infected birds. This is especially true as surveys of blue-winged teal, mottled ducks and other waterfoul in Louisiana in 1986 and 1987 detected several influenza A subtypes in these species (Stallknecht et al., '90a) . It can then be asked whether or not these alligators or crocodilians in similar situations have the ability to contract influenza A and/or become reservoirs for the influenza A virus.",

For many of these animals, more than one sample type was collected and analyzed in attempt to maximize the chances of detecting a positive result in previously untested taxa. Interestingly, of the four animals that tested positive for influenza A, either blood or serum was the sample type that gave the result. This is in contrast to the sampling regime normally used for avian influenza virus monitoring in wild birds in which cloacal swabs are most commonly used (although tracheal swabs have been taken as well). In no case did a cloacal swab (in RNAlater s solution or PBS) yield a positive result by RT-PCR, even in the same individuals where the blood or serum sample was positive. RT-PCR is known to be among the most sensitive tests available when performed correctly (Spackman et al., 2002; Elvinger et al., 2007) . However, PCR is known to be inhibited in a number of sample types, particularly cloacal swabs and in feces. A number of laboratories are working to optimize protocols for these types of samples. Further, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR workflow being employed for pathogen detection are important. In this study, differences in detection ability were observed, which could have been attributed to differences in sample preparation type and/or the assay and detection platform used. It is worthy of note as well that no tests have been validated for crocodilian samples. Tests for poultry had to be adapted as the optimal assay conditions and sample types for crocodilians have not been established.",

Crocodilians are ectotherms, having their body temperatures being regulated more as a result of the immediate thermal environment than through internal heat production. As such, their metabolic rate is low compared with mammals and birds. Further, body size plays an important role in thermal regulation in ectotherms with animals of larger mass having better heat capacity and smaller surface area for environmental heat exchange (Grigg and Seebacher, 2001) . In crocodilian species this is a relevant point as the difference in mass of a hatchling to a full grown adult can be quite large. An adult male saltwater crocodile can have a body mass of 2,000 kg or more whereas a hatchling may weigh less than 100 g (Grigg and Seebacher, 2001) . Therefore, if body temperature is a factor in the susceptibility of disease, size-class should be carefully noted when investigating disease states.",

Exposure to temperatures above and below the optimal range can result in stress-induced immune suppression (Huchzermeyer, 2000; Lance et al., 2001) . With decreasing temperature and activity, the immune system slows down in ectothermic organisms. In experimental infections of WNV in farmed juvenile alligators housed at either 32 or 271C, whereas there was no difference in infection rates among temperature groups, in general, animals housed at 271C exhibited viremia for 4-5 days longer than those housed at the higher temperature (Klenk et al., 2004) . Additionally, in this study neutralizing antibodies were detected in alligators housed at 321C on an average of 5 days earlier than animals housed at 271C, indicating a difference in immune response as a result of temperature. It is important to note, however, that a decrease in body temperature may not necessarily result in increasing vulnerability to infection as lowered temperatures may be suboptimal for the growth of many infectious agents (Huchzermeyer, 2000) . In the case of WNV, temperature is believed to play a significant role in viral replication . Nevarez, (2007) observed in three separate cases a sudden decrease in WNV detection after water temperatures in alligator pens dropped below 26.61F (as a result of water heater or artesian well pump failures). Being aware of this kind of phenomenon much earlier, Huchzermeyer (2000) dropped the house temperature of a pen of hatchling crocodiles to 291C to reduce the multiplication rate of Salmonella typhimurium, knowing that their immune systems were still functioning efficiently at this temperature.",

These conditions promote the rapid growth that is desired for the crocodilian meat and leather industry. It has been established that the reptilian immune system is quite sensitive to temperature and density-related stress, and the ability to behaviorally minimize burdens of suboptimal temperatures and environmental stressors is drastically impaired in captivereared animals (Huchzermeyer, 2000; Lance et al., 2001) . It has also been suggested that when crocodilians are raised at temperatures approaching those of mammals, they become susceptible to infectious organisms that normally affect mammals (Nevarez, 2007) , such as influenza.

However, further testing using classical means of viral detection could not confirm these results. AGID tests demonstrated nonspecific reactions to three of the four RT-PCR-positive animals (C. latirostris was not tested) and VI attempts were all negative. Discordance between RT-PCR test results and VI are not uncommon when working with specimens from wild birds (E. Spackman, unpublished data). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear, but may be due to the virus being inactivated during handling as influenza is fairly environmentally labile. Host adaptation may be an additional factor. Although most strains of influenza replicate in chicken embryos, wild-bird viruses or in this case, crocodilian viruses, may not replicate in this system. It is known that previous attempts at VI from crocodilians using embryonated chicken eggs by other investigators have been unsuccessful. Nonspecific serological results are not too surprising either given that the AGID tests were developed for poultry diagnostics using chicken origin antigens and its performance in other species is unknown. Therefore, further studies of influenza A in crocodilians should take into consideration different sampling strategies as well as additional suites of analysis tools.",

When sampling for influenza A detection, it should be considered that the highest viral loads, when present, may not be found in the cloaca, or that viral shedding through the cloaca may be conditional and/or season-dependent. Sampling of other orifices and tissues such as the membranes of the eye or throat swabs, though a tricky technique in crocodilians, should be considered as nothing is known about the possible tissue tropism or shed if virus is present. However, respiratory tissues are a site of virus replication in mammals and aves. Therefore, respiratory samples might improve detection of virus from influenza A-positive animals. In addition, additional techniques that could be employed include the use of crocodilian-derived cell lines, which can be grown from embryos (Val Lance, personal communication). Sequencing of isolated nucleic acids using conserved primers for influenza A genes may prove useful. Other methods should be considered for serology also, such as competitive ELISAs. Experimental infection of influenza A (low pathogenicity) in farm-raised crocodilians may also reveal the susceptibility of crocodilians to influenza A infection similar to those studies performed for WNV.",

Given the present study and the fact that low pathogenic forms of the influenza A virus have been circulating in many North American waterfowl and shorebirds for a long time, it would be prudent to investigate the possibility of infection in new world crocodilian species.
