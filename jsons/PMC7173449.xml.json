The first is research at the molecular level to define the virus\u2019 life cycle in its quest to produce progeny virus and then screen for pharmacologic drugs that block reproductive stages of that life cycle. To gain knowledge of what self-components the virus requires to allow its survival and production of progeny while interacting with the host, enormous computerized libraries of known chemicals or synthesized compounds are searched. The goal is to identify molecules with the ability to block viral replication. Such assays require a robust readout and automation involving robotics to screen virtually millions of test molecules to identify just a few that show promise. Any molecule identified requires, first, confirmation and, then, analysis that it is not toxic by itself. Thereafter, chemists study and modify its structure to optimize the therapeutic index, that is, the relative safety of a dose or treatment as opposed to its potentially harmful effect.",

However, these drugs are expensive and not always available in some countries. Similarly, the antiviral therapy recently discovered for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) now cures over 95% of such patients instead of the lifetime persistent infection their predecessors suffered. Additionally, the risk of developing liver cancer and needing a liver transplant is greatly diminished.

The immune system has evolved to enable the host to resist invasion by organisms like, in this case, Ebola virus. Proteins in Ebola that trigger an immune response are called antigens (immunogens). A host\u2019s immune response to antigens can travel down two very different pathways. The most common and satisfactory one provides protection, controls the infection by either preventing it totally or lessening (attenuating) its effects, and induces a protective immune response. Such a response can provide long-term protection from Ebola virus so that a repeated infection does not cause disease\u2014sort of one and done. To mimic that scenario, a vaccine is created to prime the immune response by programming it to recognize and then rapidly resist the Ebola infection in an individual who later becomes exposed to a person, animal, or substance contaminated with Ebola virus. Vaccines developed against viruses like measles, mumps, smallpox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis have changed the human and medical landscapes in that they succeeded in reducing the morbidity and mortality of human viral diseases. This success stands as one of the greatest of public health advancements. For example, smallpox alone in the 20th century killed an estimated 300 million individuals, about threefold more than all the wars of that century, including World Wars I and II. Vaccination eliminated smallpox so that, in the 21st century, not a single case has emerged.2 Similarly, if one is infected by Ebola and survives, that person is immune to reinfection. Indeed, during the 2013\u201316 Ebola outbreak, such \u201cnaturally immune\u201d individuals, because of their resistance to reinfection by Ebola, often worked to provide care and transport patients.",

At stake is whether the virus can successfully replicate itself. To combat the virus, the host mobilizes and uses many weapons, that is, both the immunologically specific and nonspecific responses. The nonspecific factors are all early combatants against the virus and the cells it infects. Included in this group are natural killer lymphoid cells, phagocytic macrophages\u2014large cells that ingest or eat viruses\u2014and proteins in the blood called complement factors that are capable of interacting with viruses and also destroying virus-infected cells. Important is the innate immune system that provides the initial defense against pathogens and primes the subsequent adoptive (T cell and antibody) immune response. The major players in the innate immune response are toll-like receptors, which recognize particular microbial patterns, and type 1 interferons (IFNs). Again, there are conflicting reports of whether IFNs are suppressed or exaggerated. Nevertheless, these innate systems are mutually complementary and are involved in developing the ensuing adoptive immune response. Type 1 IFNs upregulate molecules on cells that present major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, molecules that code for self. MHC molecules are essential for optimal interaction with T cells. Following a virus infection or vaccination, major antigen-presenting cells (called dendritic cells) present segments of viral proteins (peptides) that become located within MHC molecules to na\u00efve T cells, an action termed \u201cpriming.\u201d By this means virus-specific T cells are generated and expanded numerically. These T cells are made in the infected host for the specific control of a virus infection. Thus, the major combatants against viruses are antibodies and T lymphocytes, both of which mount the host immune response to Ebola, although the relative contribution of each is not unknown. However, in this battle, within 10\u201314 days after infection, either the replicating viruses or the host\u2019s immune response will emerge as the winner. If the immune response wins, viruses are vanquished, and the host survives with enduring immunity to that virus. However, if the immune response is overcome, the Ebola virus infection ends in the host\u2019s death or in a subset of individuals fingerprints of Ebola that can be found months later.4., 5.\n",

The T stands for thymus-derived, and CD8+ or CD4+ indicates a specific molecule present on the cells\u2019 surface used to identify the cell. The thymus is a two-lobed gland of the lymphoid system located over the heart and under the breastbone. Lymphocytes formed in the bone marrow (hemopoietic stem cells) migrate to and enter the thymus where they are educated (mature) and are then selected to become either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cells function as surveillance and killer cells, which accounts for their name \u201ccytotoxic T lymphocytes\u201d (CTLs). They travel along the highways of blood vessels and wander among tissues throughout the body seeking cells that are foreign (not like self), because they express viral proteins. CTLs then recognize, attack, and kill such cells. By this strategy they eliminate the factories making viruses. CD8+ T cells also release soluble factors like interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) that also have antiviral effects but do so without killing the virus-infected cell. CD4+ T cells predominantly serve a different role. They release soluble materials (proteins) that help or induce bone marrow-derived (nonthymic-educated) B lymphocytes to differentiate and make antibodies. CD4+ T cells release soluble factors (cytokines) that also participate in clearing a virus infection and, uncommonly, CD4+ T cells may also kill virally infected cells.",

By this means, antibodies decrease a host\u2019s content of virus and diminish infectivity. Antibodies lower the number of viruses thereby allowing CTLs to work more efficiently. Antibodies along with effector molecules like complement can kill virus-infected cells. However, this mechanism is relatively inefficient compared to CTL killing of virus-infected cells. Although over 100,000 or more viral antigens must be present on the surface of a virus-infected cell to achieve lysis by antibody, less than 10 viral antigens expressed on a cell and restricted by MHC are all that are needed for a CD8 T cell to do the job.

This task is not feasible during an Ebola infection in Africa. Yet, the transfer of convalescent plasma (plasma is blood from which red cells have been removed) harvested from Ebola-immune donors into acutely ill Ebola patients is possible. Such \u201cimmune\u201d plasma (plasma containing antibodies to Ebola) can be placed in storage and thus remain available. The million dollar questions are\u2014does this protocol work and, if so, is it of therapeutic value. For such transfers, blood is harvested in heparinized tubes to prevent clotting. T cells, red blood cells, macrophages, etc., are removed by centrifugation, and the resultant plasma is injected intravenously into the infected patient. In clinical trials with 84 patients of various ages acutely infected with Ebola virus, 200\u2013250 mL of inoculum was tested. This plasma was harvested from previously infected Ebola patients who survived the disease.6 Unfortunately, though, the survival rate of patients in the trial did not improve significantly over that of the controls who were not so-inoculated. However, the study was flawed in that neutralizing antibodies to Ebola were not quantitated or adjusted in the transferred plasma. Thus, exactly why the trial failed is not clear; was the entire procedure flawed or was the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma simply too low.6 In other studies, potent neutralizing antibodies against Ebola were isolated from B cell clones of immune individuals who had recovered from Ebola infections. One such antibody, mAb114, given only once, protected 3 of 3 macaques even when administered as late as 5 days into the infection cycle.7 The one macaque given no neutralizing antibody died at day 10 postinfection with 108 logs of virus. Similarly, potent neutralizing antibodies were isolated from a survivor of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and 77% of the 349 monoclonal antibodies isolated neutralized Ebola indicating that a broad diversity of B cell clones target sites on the Ebola glycoproteins generated during infection.8 Impetus to develop this strategy further came from these results with Ebola, and the same method was used in other animal/virus models. For example, monoclonal antibodies proved to protect guinea pigs from hemorrhagic arenavirus (Junin) infection of Argentina9 and anti-HIV-1 antibodies prevented that infection in a monkey model.10\n",

The majority of research to develop ZMapp was funded by the National Institutes of Health and Public Health Agency of Canada. When the Ebola outbreak began, the question of its use was raised, although it had not yet been deemed safe or effective for treating humans. Tests with monkeys infected with Ebola had shown a protective effect when they were given ZMapp at 3\u20135 days after infection.12 Could ZMapp have a similarly protective effect in humans? Also, ZMapp had been produced in tobacco plants, a procedure used to expand its production. Would there be an issue of sensitivity to tobacco antigens for humans in therapy provided intravenously?",

Samaritan\u2019s Purse, a Christian Relief Ministry, was coming to grips with the fact that two of its health care workers involved in treating Ebola patients, Kent Brantly, a 33-year-old physician, and Nancy Writebol, a care provider and missionary, showed clinical symptoms and signs of Ebola. The infection was confirmed by blood test. A hospital administrator for Samaritan\u2019s Purse, Lance Plyler, knew there were experimental drugs being developed elsewhere to combat Ebola. Losing no time he contacted a CDC official stationed in Monrovia to obtain names and places in the United States to seek the necessary therapeutics. Meanwhile, the infected and quarantined Kent Brantly was surfing the net with his laptop computer for a potential and possible therapy for Ebola. Brantly came across the report in Nature\n12 that ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies to neutralize Ebola, saved monkeys challenged with a lethal dose of Ebola even when they were several days into their illness. However, ZMapp had been tested only in cultured cells or animals and was not yet known to be harmless or effective in humans. Nevertheless, Brantly selected ZMapp as his choice. Was the material available? Lance Plyler contacted Gary Kobinger in Canada who was involved in the creation and testing of ZMapp. Plyler requested that the drug be sent to Samaritan\u2019s Purse Hospital for its immediate use. Kobinger informed Plyler that the nearest supply of the drug was only 480 miles away from the ELWA facility at the Doctors without Borders Kailahun Care Facility, where Khan was near death. Concerning Khan, the debate continued whether or not he should receive ZMapp. Plyler requested the drug and arranged for a helicopter to take ZMapp from the Doctors Without Borders Care Center to Monrovia.",

The plan was to then return the drug to Canada and re-evaluate its antiviral efficacy: was it stable; was there a loss in potency? Although a promising anti-Ebola therapeutic, ZMapp had not attracted robust funds for its development. In a CBS News interview, Dr. Jeffrey D. Turner, President and CEO of Defyrus, a private life sciences biodefense company that collaborated with public government public health agencies and military partners in the United Kingdom and Canada, stated \u201cThe challenge that many people don\u2019t appreciate is that our plans were to scale up this drug for 2015 and even then, small amounts for clinical trials.

How would these individuals be selected? It was into this setting that the severely ill Khan\u2019s name entered the debate. Initially and under pressure from the Sierra Leone government to do something for Khan, already recognized as a national hero in that country, the physicians treating Khan and others involved were presented with an ethical and philosophical dilemma. What if the patient died as a result of an allergic reaction to ZMapp? ZMapp had not undergone clinical trials for safety and efficacy in humans. What if the treatment failed? Many believed that Khan should receive ZMapp because, in all of West Africa, he was the leading and best known figure involved in the war on Ebola. However, others were hesitant. Also, the fact that Khan was African brought attention to the recent uproar that Westerners were subjecting Africans to lethal therapy.13\n",

This act created a strongly emotional response from the local population and the international community. Giving ZMapp to two Westerners who survived and not to Khan, an African who died, was highly controversial. Since not all those infected with Ebola die (mortality ranging 50%\u201370%), possibly the two Westerners would have survived without ZMapp. After all, many did. If Khan had been given ZMapp and died, would Africans be convinced he was used as a guinea pig to be tested with an experimental/unproved therapy without either formal local approval or approval by Western scientific and government committees? The two American recipients of ZMapp, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were members of Samaritan\u2019s Purse, the Christian Missionary in Liberia. A source from the NIH stated that someone from the CDC contacted Samaritan\u2019s Purse and that an NIH scientist later informed them of the drug. However, no one knew if the drug would work or if the ultimate recovery of those taking the ZMapp was due to the drug. After receiving ZMapp, Kent Brantly showed remarkable clinical improvement, although, in contrast, after receiving the drug Nancy Writebol\u2019s condition worsened. However, both Brantly and Writebol survived, but may have recovered without the ZMapp\u2014one does not know.

Awareness, quarantine, and prohibition of touching people sick or dead from the disease have been viewed by many Africans as myths of Western propaganda. The African custom of touching and washing the body of a dead person prior to burial was being denied and led to resentment, demonstrations, and riots. Further, such public health measures are alien to their culture. Many West Africans believe in cultural superstitions and view Ebola as a curse rather than a pathogen, associating Ebola with witchcraft and sorcery brought there by foreigners. Some locals believe that doctors are killing Ebola patients as a punishment for sexual promiscuity.
