But the advent of AIDS, the appearance of other novel diseases in human populations, and the expansion of other known infections led to the now well-established concept of emerging infections. These have been defined as those infections whose incidence in humans has increased within the past 2 decades or threatens to increase in the near future. There are many reasons that infections emerge; these have been described elsewhere,1 but some key factors include ecological disturbances (including climate change), changes in human behaviors, failure of disease and vector control, urbanization, population movement, and genetic change among disease agents. Often, these and other factors work in concert.",

Thus, although it is important to be prepared for emerging infections that threaten blood safety, it will never be possible to make an accurate determination of the next agent of concern. A framework can be built to establish readiness for such an event, however. One such attempt is a recent effort to catalog and prioritize agents of likely concern.5\n",

The etiology of the disease was unclear, although a leading hypothesis was that it was caused by an infectious agent. Eventually, a few cases were observed among individuals whose only potential risk factor was prior receipt of a blood transfusion.6 Eventually, the etiologic agent was determined to be a retrovirus, now known as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), codiscovered by Montagnier and Gallo and their collaborators in 1983\u20131984.7, 8 By March of 1985, tests for antibodies to HIV had been developed and commercialized and their routine use for blood donations had been initiated.",

As a result, many individuals had unknowingly been infected and at least 12,000 transfusion transmissions had occurred in the United States alone.9 This occurred in spite of measures that had been taken to defer donors with risk factors, in part because they had been implemented too late. Back-calculation showed that more than 1% of blood donations in San Francisco were probably infectious for AIDS at the beginning of the 1980s and that preventative measures resulted in a major decrease in that risk even before testing was put in place.10 Because of the social sensitivity of the issues, early measures placed much reliance on education of donor populations and requests for self-deferral of those with risk factors, but within a few years, direct questioning of donors had been introduced. Even at the height of the epidemic, fewer that 2% of all AIDS cases in the United States were attributable to transfusion.",

The majority of seropositive individuals were men with a history of having had sex with other men; this finding led to a tightening of donor questioning strategies.11 Measures to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by transfusion have continued to be refined and tightened over the years, with increasing focus on: donor questioning; enhanced test sensitivity, including the addition of nucleic acid testing in 1999 (in the United States); and, now, interest in the implementation of pathogen reduction technology. The measures taken to date have proved efficacious: modeling studies suggest that the residual risk of transfusion transmission is on the order of 1 per 1.5 to 2 million component units in the United States, but the actual number of transmissions detected is much lower, with only 4 cases recognized in the United States between 1999 and 2009.",

It undoubtedly had a profound impact on transfusion medicine, but it also materially affected and reoriented global attitudes toward blood safety. Before the advent of AIDS, there was a prevailing attitude that the development of some cases of post-transfusion infection was expected as an inevitable consequence of transfusion. This is not to say the issue was ignored, rather, that it was not an overriding priority. In several countries, those responsible for transfusion were subsequently held responsible for failing to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS by transfusion and were actually prosecuted. In addition, many civil cases were brought against hospitals and blood centers on behalf of patients who had been infected. Whether or not these responses were appropriate will continue to be argued, but it is clear that there is now a low tolerance for failing to deal with any transfusion-transmitted infection. This may best be illustrated by the high cost-effectiveness ratio of many of the measures that have been routinely implemented in support of blood safety.",

Also, transfusion transmission of animal-adapted strains has been shown in small animal models. When vCJD first appeared in humans (as a result of exposure to the BSE agent present in the food chain), there was concern that this new, emergent transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) might prove a risk to transfusion safety. This concern arose from the unknown nature of the infection and its unusual association with lymphoid cells and tissues. As a result, several preventative measures were put in place, well before there was any actual evidence of transfusion transmission. In the United States, the primary intervention was to defer as donors any individuals who had spent time in the United Kingdom at the peak of the BSE epidemic. The deferral was subsequently extended by including Western European countries (albeit with a different residence time) and eventually by deferring individuals receiving a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom. Several other criteria for deferral were also introduced; all are described on the Food and Drug Administraion Web site (http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/default.htm). In the United Kingdom, the deferral option was not available, but universal leukodepletion was introduced, locally derived plasma was no longer sent for fractionation, and plasma for transfusion was imported from countries at low risk of BSE.",

In a fourth instance, the agent was found in the spleen and 1 lymph node of a similarly exposed but asymptomatic individual who died of unconnected causes. The source of the infection was a donor who had transmitted the disease to 1 of the other 3 cases. All of these cases were attributable to blood components that had not been leukoreduced. More recently, the agent was also identified at autopsy in a hemophilia patient who had received products from plasma pools that included units thought to be at risk of containing the agent (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1234859690542?p=1231252394302).

Extended research studies showed that a significant proportion of blood donors, particularly in California and Florida, were infected with T cruzi.25 A test for antibodies to T cruzi was licensed in the United States in late 2006 and was implemented at the beginning of 2007. Nationwide, the donor prevalence rate was found to be approximately 1:30,000.26 Some of the seropositive donors did not have geographic risk factors and seemed to have been infected in the United States. Lookback studies on prior recipients of blood from seropositive donors, however, revealed only 2 infections from a total of 241 recipients examined (http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/BloodProductsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm155529.htm). This was 1 of the factors that led to a reevaluation of the value of testing and consideration of selective testing strategies. Such strategies were discussed at a meeting of the FDA's Blood Products Advisory Committee. The Committee endorsed the concept of selective testing, specifically on the basis of testing each donor once and accepting seronegative donors without need for any futher testing. The Committtee did, however, express concern abut the possibility of incident (new) infections among donors and recommended that selective testing be considered only if a continuing study of incidence of T cruzi infection among donors was to be conducted. One major blood supplier in the United States implemented selective (1-time) testing in August 2009 and several other smaller establishments used a variety of alternate approaches to selective testing.",

Furthermore, donors and their blood may travel and several transfusion transmissions have occurred in areas that are not endemic for Babesia. There is increasing concern about Babesia and blood transfusion in the United States, as illustrated by an FDA-sponsored workshop held September 12, 2008 (http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/NewsEvents/WorkshopsMeetingsConferences/TranscriptsMinutes/default.htm), but the future path is currently unclear.

Although one is flavivirus and the other an alphavirus, they share common transmission patterns (human-mosquito-human) and vectors (Aedes aegypti and A albopictus). Both viruses cause large outbreaks of infection and disease and one of them has been shown to be transmissible by transfusion. It should also be noted that another flavivirus , St Louis encephalitis virus is endemic to the United States and has, in the past, been responsible for sporadic, but large outbreaks. Thus, it is reasonable to consider this agent to be a potential future threat: continuing surveillance is appropriate.",

Perhaps the most comprehensive reaction has been that of the Australian Red Cross Blood Services, which has routinely stopped collection of blood components for transfusion in parts of Northern Queensland during dengue outbreaks. If an intervention is judged necessary, it would be appropriate to consider the use of a test for DENV RNA: a measure comparable to that used for WNV. Such a test is not commercially available (at least as of early 2010), but a test for a viral NS1 antigen is available34; it would be expected to identify high-titer viremic donations.",

Hundreds of thousands of residents, representing more than 40% of the population were infected. The island is an overseas department of France, and authorities took extensive steps to protect the safety of the blood supply. Tests for CHIKV nucleic acids were implemented (finding 2 in 500 donations to be viremic); red cell collections were discontinued on the island (needed red cells were provided directly from France); and pathogen reduction technology was implemented for platelet concentrates, which were collected locally.37 Another small but unexpected outbreak occurred in Italy, as a result of an infected traveler.38 This event also led to regional prohibition of blood collection for the duration of the outbreak.",

As discussed previously, dengue is already endemic in Puerto Rico and is subject to annual outbreaks. There have also been outbreaks in Hawaii and a high seroprevalence rate has been found in residents of Brownsville, Texas, with much higher rates across the Mexican border. In late 2009, there was an outbreak of locally transmitted dengue in Key West (http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/medicine/arboviral/Dengue_FloridaKeys.html). Certainly, A aegypti (the preferred vector for DENV) is present in parts of the Southern United States; thus, conditions exist for some spread of the virus on the mainland. It is not, however, clear that sustained transmission could occur. The issue for chikungunya may be a little more complex, as A albopictus is much more widespread and chikungunya cases among travelers returning to the United States are not uncommon.39 There are many other arboviruses, but there is really no clear basis for making any predictions about their future spread.",

Given that it sems transmissible between animals by the oral route, it is reasonable to question whether or not it could become a human pathogen in a fashion analogous to BSE.41 Despite some apparent clusters of CJD in younger individuals with a history of hunting,42 there has been no evidence to date to support such a species jump for the CWD agent.",

Regulatory agencies, however, have questioned whether or not there might be risk of emergence of a pathogenic mutant of SFV in association with species jump. When linked with concern about the potential for transfusion transmission of the virus (which has been demonstrated in macaques but not in humans),45, 46, 47, 48 this has led regulators to ask whether or not some intervention is warranted.

None of these approaches is 100% effective, and all suffer from some disadvantages, such as poor sensitivity or specificity, lengthy development process, high direct or indirect costs, and so forth. Conceptually, it would be desirable to have a generic method that would be proactive instead of reactive. Many believe that pathogen inactivation represents such a solution. Several treatment methods are available for plasma for transfusion and for platelet concentrates but no method for red cell concentrates has yet been brought to market.5 The approaches have been put into practice at least in part, in several European countries. Although the methods have been shown to effectively inactivate significant titers of a variety of pathogens and model organisms in laboratory studies, their potential for elimination of as yet unknown emerging infections is necessarily unknown. Also, the absence of methods that can inactivate all blood components is a disadvantage. It is also apparent that currently available methods do have some negative impact upon treated products. No method is currently available for use in the United States and the regulatory barrier appears to be high. Available methods, their properties and advantages and disadvantages are described in several reviews and other publications.5, 51, 52\n",
