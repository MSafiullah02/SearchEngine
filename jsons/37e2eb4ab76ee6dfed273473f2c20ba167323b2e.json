Cobham considers a fixed base r and represents integers as finite strings of r digits. A subset X of integers is r\u2212recognizable if there exists a finite automaton accepting precisely the representations in base r of its elements. Cobham's theorem says that if X is rand s-recognizable for two multiplicatively independent values r and s (i.e., for all i, j > 0 it holds r i = s j ) then X is definable in Presburger arithmetic, i.e., in N, + [11, 18] . Conversely, each Presburger-definable subset of N is r-recognizable for every r. This result was extended to integer relations of arbitrary arity by Sem\u00ebnov [19] .",

In the papers [3, 5, 6] the equivalence was proved between (1) R, +, <, Zdefinability, (2) rand s-recognizability where the two bases have distinct primes in their factorization [6, Thm 5] and (3) rand s-weakly recognizability for two independently multiplicative bases, [6, Thm 6 ] (a relation is r-weakly recognizable if it is recognized by some deterministic Muller automaton in which all states in the same strongly connected component are either final or nonfinal). Consequently, as far as reals are concerned, definability in R, +, <, Z compared to recognizability or weak recognizability by automata on infinite strings can be seen as the analog of Presburger arithmetic for integers compared to recognizability by automata on finite strings.",

            "text": "A natural issue is to find effective characterizations of subclasses of r\u2212recognizable relations. In the case of relations over integers, Muchnik proved that for every base r \u2265 2 and arity k \u2265 1, it is decidable whether a r-recognizable relation X \u2286 N k is Presburger-definable [17] (see a different approach in [14] which provides a polynomial time algorithm). For relations over reals, up to our knowledge, the only known result is due to Milchior who proved that it is decidable (in linear time) whether a weakly r\u2212recognizable subset of R is definable in R, +, <, 1 [15] . Our result provides an effective characterization of R, +, <, 1 -definable relations within R, +, <, Z -definable relations. Our approach is inspired by Muchnik's one, which consists of giving a combinatorical characterization of N, + -definable relations that can be expressed in N, + itself. Now we give a short outline of our paper. Section 2 gathers all the basic on the two specific structures R, +, <, Z and R, +, <, 1 , taking advantage of the existence of quantifier elimination which allows us to work with simpler formulas. Section 3 introduces topological notions. In particular we say that the neighborhood of a point x \u2208 R n relative to a relation X \u2286 R n has strata if there exists a direction such that the intersection of all sufficiently small neighborhoods around x with X is the trace of a union of lines parallel to the given direction. This reflects the fact that the relations we work with are defined by finite unions of regions of the spaces delimited by hyperplanes of arbitrary dimension. In Sect. 5 we show that when X is R, +, <, 1 -definable all points (except finitely many which we call singular) have at least one direction which is a stratum. In Sect. 6 we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a R, +, <, Z -definable relation to be R, +, <, 1 -definable, namely (1) it has finitely many singular points and (2) all intersections of X with arbitrary hyperplanes parallel to n \u2212 1 axes and having rational components on the remaining axis are R, +, <, 1definable. Then we show that these properties are expressible in R, +, <, 1, X .",

It has no singular point thus it satisfies condition (1), but does not satisfy (2) since, e.g., the rational section X (0) 0 = {0} \u00d7 Z is not R, +, <, 1 -definable. Now, consider the relation X = {(x, x) | x \u2208 Z} which is R, +, <, Z -definable. It does not satisfy condition (1) since every element of X is singular, but it satisfies (2) because every rational section of X is either empty or equal to the singleton {(x, x)} for some x \u2208 Z, thus is R, +, <, 1 -definable. Now we give an idea of the proof since it cannot fit in the space allowed. The necessity of point 1 follows from Proposition 4. That of point 2 results from the fact that all rational constants are R, +, <, 1 -definable by Theorem 1, and moreover that R, +, <, 1 -definable relations are closed under direct product and intersection. Now the sufficiency. Corollary 4 suggests that we proceed by induction on the dimension of the \u223c-classes. There are finitely many classes of dimension 0 since there are finitely many singular points so the base of the induction is guaranteed. Now the intersection of a nonsingular class E with a line passing through a point x in the class and parallel to a direction of the class is a finite union of open segments, see Lemma 6. If the segment containing x is closed or half-closed then one of its adherent point belongs to a class F of lower dimension and we can define E relatively to F via the notion of compatibility. However the line may not intersect any other equivalence class. So we consider the canonical subspaces, see below, since every line has an intersection with one of these. (4) In particular Q {1,...,n} = {0} and by convention Q \u2205 = R n . The Q i 's are the canonical subspaces. The Q i 's are not vectorial subspaces but with some abuse of language we will write dim(Q I ) to mean dim(Q I ) = n \u2212 |I|.

We believe that the answer is positive and it can be formally proven in dimension 2. Note that even if one proves such a result, the question of providing an effective characterization is more complex. Indeed the sentence \u03c8 n of Proposition 5 expresses a variant of the criterion of Theorem 3, and we use heavily the fact that we work within R, +, <, Z to ensure that this variant is actually equivalent to the criterion. In particular the construction of \u03c8 n relies on Lemma 5 to express that a point is X\u2212singular. However if we consider e.g. X = Q then every element x of X is singular while no element x of X satisfies the condition stated in Lemma 5. Another question is the following. In Presburger arithmetic it is decidable whether or not a formula is equivalent to a formula in the structure without <, cf. [10] . What about the case where the structure is R, +, <, Z ?",
