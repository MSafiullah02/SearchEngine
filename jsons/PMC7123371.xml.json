ApoC3 not only inhibits hydrolysis by LipP of TGs in TRLs and counters conversion of VLDLs to IDLs and LDLs by LipC but also lowers hepatic uptake of TRLs through LDLR and LRP1 and, on light LDLs, enhances conversion to dense LDLs [741]. The smaller dense proatherogenic LDLs in addition to VLDL and remnant lipoproteins (small VLDLs and IDLs) enter the arterial intima, where they are oxidized and taken up by macrophages. Macrophages that reside in the arterial intima secrete LipD, which can process TRLs to remnants, which can then be taken up by macrophages, lipid accumulation generating foam cells. Enrichment of ApoC3 in ApoB+ lipoproteins (VLDLs and LDLs) increases the risk for atherosclerosis. Furthermore, ApoC3 favors inflammation, as it activates NF\u03baB and thus elicits vcam1 production [739].",

It controls formation of apolipoprotein-B100, LD mobilization, and hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion. This determinant of hepatic VLDL metabolism interacts on the LD surface with ApoB100, the main structural protein of hepatic VLDLs, which connects to many chaperones (heat shock proteins) involved in the ERAD pathway.12 Lipidated ApoB100 translocates from the ER lumen to the LD surface. ApoB is lipidated to form pre-VLDL, whereas incorrectly folded and lipidated ApoB is destroyed. Accumulation of AUP1 on LDs hampers ApoB lipidation and VLDL assembly, independently of the MAP2K1/2\u2013ERK pathway; the average size of the LDs declines; smaller underlipidated ApoB+ lipoproteins are secreted instead of fully lipidated VLDLs. Hepatic AUP1 production lowers in obese subjects and in those with \nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; Sect. 5.3.4) and T2DM patients (diabetic dyslipidemia) [744].",

On the other hand, ApoA dissociates from ApoB and moves to the trans-Golgi network and then possibly to Rab11+ recycling endosomes to be resecreted, about 30% of ApoA being recycled back to the extracellular space [785]. In the extracellular medium, ApoA re-associates with newly formed or circulating LDL, hence generating LPA, and is cleared via various receptors, enters the vessel wall or kidney, or is degraded. Endocytosis of ApoA and its recycling rely on the plasminogen receptor-KT (PlgRkt).41 Several hepatic receptors are involved in LPA catabolism. Its clearance and possible lysosomal degradation can rely on LDLR, VLDLR, LRP1, LRP2, ScaRb1, and syndecan-1 [783]. Once LPA is connected to LDLR and LRP1, clathrin-mediated endocytosis leads to lysosomal degradation of its lipid moiety and associated ApoA.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and redox stress due to elevated ROS formation induce neuronal lipid production and transport of lipids from neurons to gliocytes for storage in LDs that can contribute to the adjustment to redox stress. In neurons, lactate is converted to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. In addition, lactate accumulation in neurons triggers the production of lipids that are subsequently transferred to gliocytes, in which they form LDs. Conversely, formation of glial LDs requires lactate transfer from gliocytes to neurons using monocarboxylate transporters in addition to fatty acid transporters, and apolipoproteins [788]. Glial lactate is then used for lipid synthesis within neurons. Monocarboxylate transporters enable gliocytes to secrete and neurons to absorb lactate. Lactate metabolites provide substrates for the synthesis of fatty acids, which are processed and transferred to gliocytes by FATP and apolipoproteins. In the presence of high ROS concentrations, impaired lactate transfer and low concentrations of FATP or apolipoproteins decrease glial LD formation. Apolipoproteins ApoD and ApoE participate in the transfer of lipids between neurons and gliocytes. Whereas ApoE2 and ApoE3 promote LD formation, ApoE4 leads only to the weak formation of LDs, even under conditions of overexpression and redox stress. Therefore, stress-primed LD formation, which relies on neuronal lactate, is not supported by ApoE4.",

Once \u03b2 AR is activated by NAd and circulating adrenaline, it stimulates PKA that then phosphorylates Ca2+-handling proteins. PI3K does not affect Ca2+ effectors directly, but operates via \u03b2 ARK1, which phosphorylate liganded GPCRs, leading to their desensitization and internalization, thereby reducing the plasmalemmal density and \u03b21AR-mediated positive inotropy. On the other hand, PI3Kc1\u03b3 is implicated in signaling triggered by \u03b22AR using the cAMP\u2013PKA axis confined to plasmalemmal nanodomains, hence controlling Ca2+ transient amplitude and decay kinetics, limiting the Ca2+ spike magnitude, but keeping a proper gating duration [837]. Calcium transient amplitude elevates and decay kinetics lowers in PIK3CG\u2212\u2215\u2212 adult ventriculomyocytes, which are more sensitive to stimulation by \u03b22AR, which are compartmentalized in plasmalemmal compartments, via a kinase-unrelated mechanism. PI3Kc1\u03b3 serves as an anchoring protein that maintains within the same complexes PKA and PDE3a and PDE4a\u2013PDE4b, thereby favoring PDE activation by PKA and subsequent cAMP degradation in restricted compartments. Whereas PI3K\u03b3-regulated PDE4 limits cAMP owing to subplasmalemmal domains close to CaV1.2a, restraining Ca2+ influx and inotropic response, PI3K\u03b3-regulated PDE3 and PDE4 may control phospholamban activity and thus a cAMP pool at the ER for Ca2+ re-uptake during diastole, hence yielding proper lusitropy.",

Liver-specific deletion of the MFN2 gene engenders glucose intolerance and enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis [873]. Deficiency of Mfn2 in hypothalamic POMC+ 105 neurons decreases energy expenditure and causes hyperphagia and hence obesity [874]. Ablation of the MFN2 gene in both white and brown adipocytes of SD- and LFD-fed mice provokes BAT dysfunction with lipid accumulation in the BAT, impaired ETC activity, and a blunted response to adrenoceptor stimulation [873]. Selective ablation of MFN2 in BAT improves glucose tolerance under HFD, but alters cold-stimulated thermogenesis. In HFD-fed obese mice with BATMFN2 deletion, improved insulin sensitivity results from a gender-specific rewiring of the mitochondrial function. In females, mitochondria of brown adipocytes have a higher efficiency for ATP synthesis by FA oxidation, whereas in males, ETCcomplex-I activity declines and glycolysis to lactate rises linked to increased expression of the glycolytic enzyme isoform PKM2 in BAT [875]. Hence, selective excision of MFN2 in brown adipocytes improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice via increased glycolysis in male mouse BAT and coupled lipid import capacity and fatty acid oxidation in female mouse BAT, thereby preventing, whatever the gender, obesity-linked insulin resistance. On the other hand, Ucp1 deletion affects neither the ETC activity nor fatty acid oxidation capacity coupled with ATP synthesis.",

In response to cold exposure, thermogenesis in BAT is activated by adrenoceptor signaling, which raises lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation linked to proton leak through UCP1. Expression of Mfn2 and UCP1 is upregulated in BAT after acute cold exposure or treatment with \u03b23 AR agonist in addition to feeding.

Ornithine is processed into polyamines by ornithine decarboxylase and proline by ornithine aminotransferase. Arginase has two isozymes; arginase-1 localizes to the cytoplasm and abounds in the liver; mitochondrial arginase-2 is the primary isoform in the kidney. Both isozymes lodge in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells; their synthesis can be upregulated by glucose and ROS [900].

Adiponectin release regulation depends on the state of the cardiovascular apparatus. Elevated adiponectinemia is associated with reduced vascular redox stress and better endothelial function in CoAD patients. However, adiponectin release from pvAT and eAT is associated with greater superoxide generation in neighboring vessels and the myocardium. In humans with increased vascular redox stress, products of peroxidation produced in vascular walls that are transferred to the pvAT and eAT trigger adiponectin expression in pvAT via PPAR\u03b3 (NR1c3).

            "text": "The GLP1 receptor, a prototypical member of the family-B GPCRs, is a major target for T2DM treatment. It can launch cAMP production by AC via the Gs subunit, Ca2+ mobilization, and G-protein-independent ERK1/2 signaling. Glucagon-like peptide-1 and oxyntomodulin initiate ligand-directed signaling. Ligand-determined signaling, i.e., ligand-induced differential signaling, refers to functional selectivity, i.e., the ability of different ligands (full and partial agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators) of a given receptor to elicit distinct cellular responses due to ligand- and effector-binding specificity of the receptor. In other words, receptors trigger biased signaling, a given agonist preferentially activating a given signaling cascade over others (biased agonism). Biased GPCR agonists distinctly activate signaling pathways with different potencies, whereas unbiased agonists activate these pathways with equal efficiency. In addition, biased ligands stabilize receptor conformations that differ from those primed by unbiased ligands. Distinct biased ligands of the same receptor can stabilize different receptor conformations, which engage different intracellular effectors. Multiple subtypes of G proteins can be engaged with distinct efficacies and kinetics and different types of GPCR ligands and allosteric modulators bias the G-protein coupling, which then depends not only on messenger type but also on the relative amounts of the GPCR subunits and intracellular regulators. G-protein-coupling profiles of GPCRs are related to the variety of \u03b1 (16 subtypes with distinct properties), \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits of G proteins, a given receptor being coupled with multiple types of G protein subunits with varying potency and kinetics [1039]. Furthermore, GPCRs trigger canonical and alternative signaling cascades. They signal not only via heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins but also via other effectors such as \u03b2-arrestins. Biased ligands selectively change the propensity of GPCR coupling to either G proteins or \u03b2-arrestin. On the one hand, liganded GPCRs are phosphorylated by kinases and connect to arrestin, which triggers GPCR desensitization and endocytosis, thereby hindering G-protein coupling with the receptor. Arrestin attracts adaptors and clathrin for GPCR internalization and desensitization. Nevertheless, inhibition of endocytosis does not reduce the initial cAMP production, but the later cAMP accumulation, agonist-bound GPCR signaling, such as that primed by Gs-coupled \u03b22-adrenoceptor, PTH, TSH, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and dopamine, continuing once it is internalized after a short delay (arrestin-based endocytic signaling) [1040]. On the other hand, G-protein-independent signaling uses arrestin, which recruits and activates the ERK cascade. \u03b2-Arrestin thus generates its own signaling via the cRaf\u2013MAP2K\u2013ERK axis when the GPCR\u2013Arr complex resides on endosomes (arrestin-based cortical signaling). Arrestin tethers to GPCRs according to two modes [1041]. Stable binding of arrestin to phosphorylated amino acids in the intracellular loop of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which persists for minutes after agonist removal, upregulates ERK, whereas transient binding of arrestin to the unphosphorylated receptor lessens ERK signaling, as it attracts a protein phosphatase. Therefore, the ERK signaling bias is determined by binding modes of arrestin to the receptor.",

It modulates immunocyte transfer, helper T-cell differentiation, NK-cell activity, phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, and ROS production. It activates antigen-presenting cell function. It stimulates Y1 and exerts a gastrointestinal proinflammatory action. NPy promotes NOS2 expression and subsequent redox stress and inflammation. In the mouse gastrointestinal tract, NPy+ nerves contact immunocytes such as IgA-producing lymphocytes in the ileum lamina propria. In humans, it stimulates proliferation of lymphocytes in the colonic lamina propria. Nonetheless, the proinflammatory NPy effect may be countered by its induced vasoconstriction, the sympathetic action on splanchnic resistance arteries being co-mediated by the sympathetic triad, that is, ATP, NAd, and NPy. NPy potentiates NAd- and ATP-primed mesenteric vasoconstriction via postjunctional Y1 receptor [1028].

Small rings of circular smooth muscle can contract independently with a spatiotemporal coordination due to interconnected neural modules with repeated and overlapping circumferential, ascending, and descending circuits, peristalsis corresponding to the sequential contraction of the circular smooth muscle initiated by local stretch due to the intraluminal content that propels the alimentary bolus. The circumferential circuit, which is activated by mechanical stimulation of EPANs, synapses with local inhibitory and excitatory motoneurons.The ascending excitatory circuit involves EPANs, AINs, and ECMMNs.The descending inhibitory circuit relies on a different EPAN type with long anal projections connected to ICMMNs.The descending excitatory circuit includes mechanosensitive EPANs in addition to ECMMNs. The secreto- and vasomotor neural pathways comprise EPANs of both the submucosal and myenteric plexuses and cholinergic and noncholinergic SMNs and VMNs in the submucosal ganglia.",

Proglucagon is initially cleaved at the Lys79\u2013Arg80 site and engenders \nglicentin and \nmajor proglucagon fragment (MPGF). The amino acid sequence of glicentin contains that of glucagon; hence, in the pancreas, glicentin serves as an intermediate in the formation of glucagon. In the pancreas, proglucagon engenders \nglicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP; proGcg(1\u201330)), glucagon (proGcg(33\u201361)), intervening peptide IP1 (proGcg(64\u201369)), and MPGF (proGcg(72\u2013158)). Glicentin (proGcg(1\u201369)) is cleaved at the Lys31\u2013Arg32 and Lys62\u2013Arg63 sites in GRPP, glucagon, and IP1, whereas MPGF accumulates and is slowly and partly processed to GLP1 after cleavage at the Arg109\u2013Arg110 site. In pancreatic islet \u03b1 cells, proglucagon is cleaved by PCSK1 to \nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1 [proGcg(72\u2013107/108)]) and by PCSK2 to glucagon. These cells possess a high concentration of PCSK2, which processes proglucagon to glucagon, but a very low PCSK1 concentration.265\nIn the gut and brain, proglucagon generates glicentin (enteroglucagon [proGcg(1\u201369)]), truncated GLP1 (tGLP1 [proGcg(78\u2013107)]), intervening peptide IP2 (proGcg(111\u2013122/123)), and \nglucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP2 [proGcg(126\u2013158)]). Hence, in intestinal endocrine L cells, proglucagon cleaved by PCSK1, which is both necessary and sufficient for complete proglucagon processing, engenders GLP1, a potent incretin hormone, and GLP2, a regulator of gut mucosal growth and integrity. An additional cleavage of GLP1 at Arg109 yields short active forms of GLP1, collectively termed truncated GLP1, GLP1(7\u201337) (proGcg(78\u2013108)) and its desglycyl C-terminally amidated counterpart, GLP1(1\u201336)\u2013amide (GLP1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$_{(\\mathrm{1--36})}^{\\mathrm {NH}_2}$$\n\\end{document}(1\u201336)NH2 [proGcg(78\u2013107)]).

In humans, almost all of GLP1 secreted from the gut is amidated. Glicentin engenders GRPP and \noxyntomodulin (enteroglucagon [proGcg(33\u201369])]) using PCSK2. The pancreatic \u03b2 cell secretes glucagon that counterbalances the hypoglycemic action of insulin, whereas the intestinal L cell releases a potent insulinotropic hormone, tGLP1(7\u201336), the active truncated GLP1 form produced from GLP1(1\u201336) cleavage by PCSK1 or PCSK3.",

Stem, transit-amplifying, progenitor, and precursor cells are all characterized by a gene expression pattern linked to an epigenetic signature. Intestinal transit-amplifying cells migrate toward the tip of the villus axis, where they undergo apoptosis and are shed into the lumen of the healthy intestine. Whereas primed stem cells generate transit-amplifying cells, quiescent stem cells only proliferate when transit-amplifying cells are formed and begin to synthesize sonic hedgehog [1067].

The chromatin polycomb repressive complex, PRC1 monoubiquitinates histone H2a (Lys119) owing to its Ub ligase RNF51, the activity of which is enhanced by Ring1b. The complex PRC2 methylates H3 (Lys27) because of its methyltransferase subunits KTM6a and KTM6b; it prevents CDKN2A gene transcription. Loss of PRC1 impairs ISC function and causes intestinal stem cell exhaustion. Deletion of PRC2 specifically affects the proliferation of cryptic transit-amplifying cells, provoking the accumulation of intestinal cells of the secretory lineage, especially goblet and enteroendocrine cells. This accumulation does not result from impaired proliferation of progenitor cells upon CDKN2A activation, but from regulation of the transcription factors responsible for secretory lineage commitment [1061]. The complex PRC2 does indeed control the equilibrium between secretory and absorptive lineage differentiation programs, that is, the cell fate balance between secretory cells and enterocytes. It controls proliferation of cells within the crypt and represses the transcription factor bHLHa14, thereby favoring the generation of enterocytes rather than secretory cell types in the adult intestine [1061]. Therefore, PRC2 exerts a dual role in the intestinal epithelium, as it represses CDKN2A expression, hence preserving progenitor cell proliferation, and restricts secretory commitment by targeting master regulators of cell differentiation, thus coordinating cell differentiation, avoiding erroneous activation of secretory lineage differentiation.",

Activated bHLHe76 primes CYP1 gene transcription and hence production of inducible CyP1a1, CyP1a2, and CyP1b1,which metabolize xenobiotics, in addition to UGT1a6. Cytochrome-P450-1, which are detoxifying mono-oxygenases, oxygenate bHLHe76 ligands for clearance, the resulting metabolites having decreased activity and increased water solubility, thereby controlling bHLHe76 ligand availability and terminating bHLHe76 activation [1070]. On the other hand, inhibition of CyP1a1 increases the presence of bHLHe76 ligands and prolongs bHLHe76 activation. Sustained bHLHe76 activation by ligands resisting clearance or by constitutively active bHLHe76 has deleterious effects. Constitutive expression of CyP1a1 in intestinal epitheliocytes causes a loss of type-3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and TH17 cells, which depend on bHLHe76 for survival, increasing susceptibility to enteric infection. In addition, environmental factors, such as redox stress and chemical pollutants, modulate CyP1 activity. Constitutive CyP1a1 activity may be counter-balanced by increased intake of dietary bHLHe76 ligands [1070].",

Both PAQR1 and PAQR2 enhance ceramidase activity; adiponectin lowers ceramide concentration via these receptors. Accumulation of ceramide and glucosylceramide and hence hypo-adiponectinemia are involved in insulin resistance and atherosclerosis [936]. Both G-protein-coupled PAQR1 and PAQR2 tether to globular and full-length adiponectin; PAQR1 and PAQR2 have a high and intermediate affinity for globular adiponectin, respectively. The nuclear receptors NR1c1 and NR1c3 regulate PAQR1 and PAQR2 formation in adipocytes (but not in myocytes). PAQR1 and PAQR2 abound in the muscle and liver, respectively. PAQR1 and PAQR2 mainly target AMPK and NR1c1, respectively, and elicit fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake upon adiponectin binding.
