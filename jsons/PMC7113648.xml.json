            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus is a member of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus. PED is a highly contagious diarrheal disease, characterized by severe watery diarrhea and high mortality in piglets. PED was originally identified in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972). Since then, it has been reported in several European and Asian countries including China and Korea. Since 2010, a highly virulent strain of PEDV emerged in China and caused significant loss in the pig industry (Sun et al., 2012). In May 2013, this virulent strain of PEDV was recognized in the United States (US). By March 8 of 2014, PED had been detected in 27 US states and a total 4458 cases were confirmed (http://www.aasv.org/pedv/PEDv_weekly_report_140312.pdf). The disease has caused severe economic losses to the swine industry in the US. Recently the virus was found in Canada.",

Complete genomic analysis of the virulent PEDV strains from the US showed that they cluster in a single clade and are closely related with the AH2012 strain reported in China (Stevenson et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2013). Recently, we reported a new variant PEDV detected in Ohio (Wang et al., 2014). Clinical observation indicated that this new variant virus (OH 851) caused mild clinical disease with low mortality in newborn piglets (unpublished data), making it a potential vaccine candidate. Strain OH 851 is distinct from the virulent strains of PEDV in the US and is most closely related to CH/HBQX/10 reported in central China (Zheng et al., 2013), based on the phylogenetic analysis of the full-length spike gene (Wang et al., 2014). Further analysis showed that the strain OH851 differs from the virulent strains of PEDV in the first 1170 nucleotides (nt) of spike gene, indicating that at least two genotypes of PEDV are circulating in the US pigs (Stevenson et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Since effective vaccines are not currently available in North America, accurate diagnosis combined with biosecurity is the only reliable method for control and prevention of PED. Electron microscopy was widely used in the diagnosis of the initial outbreaks of PEDV (Pospischil et al., 1981). Since then, several methods have been developed for laboratory diagnosis of PEDV, including the direct immunofluorescence test for detection of PEDV antigen (Guscetti et al., 1998), enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) for detection of either PEDV antigen or antibodies (Carvajal et al., 1995), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Kwon et al., 1997, Ishikawa et al., 1997). In recent years, real-time RT-PCR has increasingly been used to detect viral pathogens because of its advantages including high specificity and sensitivity, fast turnaround, and quantification of pathogen loads. Currently, the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Ohio Department of Agriculture uses a real-time RT-PCR method which targets the membrane (M) gene for detection of PEDV. However, since the M gene is highly conserved between the virulent and the variant strains of PEDV in the US, this real-time RT-PCR assay cannot differentiate between the two strains of PEDV. Therefore, the present study sought to develop and evaluate a duplex real-time RT-PCR method to distinct between the virulent and the variant strains of PEDVs.",

            "text": "PEDV causes diarrhea in pigs and high mortality in piglets. Since May of 2013, PEDV has been identified in the US resulting in severe economic losses to the US swine industry. Data on PED outbreaks have been collected and complied by the US National Animal Health Laboratory Network each week since June 17 of 2013. Since there is no PEDV vaccine available in North America, it is important to take biosecurity strategies to control PED. The findings of a recent study demonstrated that PEDV was found in 5.2% of trailers used to transport pigs, highlighting the importance of strict biosecurity (Lowe et al., 2014).",

Genetic analysis showed that this virus differed from the virulent strains of PEDV currently circulating in the US in the 5\u2032 end of the S1 domain (mainly located in the first 1170 nt of spike gene), thus the real-time RT-PCR targeting on the M gene does not provide differentiation of the variant PEDV from virulent strain of PEDV. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a duplex real-time RT-PCR which would detect and differentiate the virulent strain from the variant strain of PEDV.",

To differentiate specifically the variant PEDV from the virulent strains of PEDV, probes were designed by targeting the highly variable region containing the first two deletions present in the variant PEDV (Fig. 1). It is possible that the third deletion and insertion site may also be used as a target for designing primers and probes (Fig. 1). The assay is specific for PEDVs, since cross-reaction with non-PED viral genomes used in this study was not detected. In addition, the assay is highly sensitive, being able to detect 1 copy in 25 \u03bcl reaction of either variant or virulent strains of PEDV.",
