It spread rapidly throughout China, resulting in a nation-wide epidemic; moreover, there were reports of sporadic cases globally. Previously published reports describe the imaging features of patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia [2, 3] . These reports have highlighted the clinical importance of chest computed tomography (CT) for the detection and management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the infection control in the CT suite is also critically important because high rate of presumed hospital-related transmission of COVID-19 (41.3%) was reported [1, 4] . Radiologists should not only be aware of the CT features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia but they must also be well informed of the infection control protocols to be followed inside the CT suite to prevent the spread of infection. Herein, we present our experience with infection control protocol for COVID-19 inside the CT suite.",
