The etiology of the respiratory disease is multifactorial, often associated with mixed infection by different pathogens, where an interaction between these pathogens and/or commensal bacteria may determine the severity of the disease (Samy and Naguib, 2018). There is a wide range of viruses that cause respiratory infections in Egyptian poultry farms, including avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1, H9N2, and H5N8, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT).",

On the hand, IBV has been reported in Egypt in the 1950s and outbreaks continued in Egyptian flocks despite vaccination with the Massachusetts (Mass) strains. This is possibly due to the emergence of new Egyptian variants, which are closely related to the Israeli variant 2 (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006). More recently, Egyptian variant II, which is closely related to Israeli variant 1 was reported (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012; Hosseini et al., 2015) and the continued evolution of IBV field strains lead to outbreaks in vaccinated chicken populations (Abdel-Sabour et al., 2017). Currently, IBV outbreaks are associated with respiratory distress and nephropathy with high mortalities due to the circulation of nephropathogenic IBV variant II strains (Ali et al., 2018).",

Co-infection with pathogens causing respiratory problems has been observed before in many natural cases, e.g., LPAI H9N2 with HPAIV H5N1 in China, Israel, Bangladesh, and Egypt (Arafa et al., 2012; Hassan et al., 2016), IBV co-infection with HPAIV and/or LPAIV (Roussan et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2016), and avian influenza with Staphylococcus spp. (Tashiro et al., 1987). Mixed viral infections were studied under experimental conditions in chickens such as NDV and LPAI (Costa-Hurtado et al., 2014; Costa-Hurtado et al., 2016) and IBV and LPAI in chickens (Hassan et al., 2017) and found to aggravate the disease condition. Though avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes are circulating in different poultry production sectors in Egypt for almost 7 yr, no reassortant evidence has been reported. However, a recent study demonstrated the genetic compatibility of both viruses to produce new reassortant viruses that showed variable pathogenicity with no zoonotic potential in the ferret model (Naguib et al., 2017).",

It has been claimed that co-infection of H9N2 with other respiratory viruses complicates the clinical picture (Hassan et al., 2017), possibly via the IBV trypsin-like proteases activate the HA cleavage of H9N2 (Ng and Liu, 2000). The NDV was detected in 13 commercial broiler flocks despite intensive vaccination regimes. The widespread of the genotype VII NDV infection in commercial broilers might be attributed to the short lifespan of broiler chickens that does not allow full protective immunity by inactivated or classical live vaccines (Ji et al. 2018). Additionally, the retarded biosecurity, mixed infections, and/or the difference between the circulating and vaccine strains may count for such evidence (Hassan et al., 2016). All isolated ND viruses confirmed that they belonged to genotype VII, which is in consent with previous studies (Mohamed et al., 2011; Radwan et al., 2013; Saad et al., 2017).",

However, by early 2017 the H5N8 virus was detected in both commercial broiler and layer chickens (Salaheldin et al., 2018; Yehia et al., 2018). Sequence analysis of the isolated H5N8 revealed that it belongs to the 2.2.3.4b clade. Though partial HA gene sequences were recovered, different amino acid differences were noticed among the isolated H5N8 viruses from domestic chickens compared to their counterparts from wild birds (93.8 to 98.2% amino acids identities). For instance, the strain A/chicken/Qalubia/MEVACF33/2017 H5N8 possessed 6 amino acids substitutions (S56I, D88G, A134P, N146K, M175L, G342W) compared to the first detected H5N8 in Egypt (A/Common coot/Egypt/CA285/2016). None of these amino acid changes is in the previously reported important genetic sites, however, their biological properties need to be elucidated. Meanwhile, all the isolated H5N8 viruses retain the preferential binding to \u03b1-2\u20133-Gal avian-like receptors as indicated by aa 222Q and 224 G at the receptor binding pocket of the HA1 molecule (Kandeil et al., 2017). The differences between domestic and wild birds H5N8 isolates further support previous reports of separate introductions of HPAI H5N8 viruses in domestic poultry in Egypt (Salaheldin et al., 2018; Yehia et al., 2018).",

Though the efficacy of some commercial vaccines against HP H5N8 viruses ranged between 80 to 90%, all these trials were under experimental conditions (Kapczynski et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2017; Kandeil et al., 2018). Nevertheless, field observations indicate that both commercial broiler and layer chickens are not protected by H5N1 vaccination. Thus, the cross-reactivities of different H5N1 clades with the isolated H5N8 viruses were analyzed. Antisera raised against inactivated H5N1 viruses belonging to clades 2.2.1 and 2.2.1.2 showed minimal reactivity with H5N8 viruses suggesting poor cross-protection. Though the heterologous protection of H5N1 vaccines against H5N8 challenge was attributed to the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), it was not clear if the increase of ADCC response would be adequate to protect vaccinated mice against H5N8 virus infection (Park et al., 2016).",

To conclude, the high rate of mixed infections and poor biosecurity measures are contributing to the increased vulnerability to infection.
