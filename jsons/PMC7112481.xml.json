Broadly, there are two types of information: local or global.15 For example, news obtained from the social neighborhood of\nan individual is local, but information from the mass media or from the public health\nauthorities can be regarded as global. The influences of local16\u201320 or global21\u201323 information based behavioral responses, or\nawareness, on the epidemic dynamics can in general be quite different, and there is also\nrecent work on the effects of combined local and global information based awareness.24\u201327 Quantitatively, the impact\nof different types of information-based awareness can be characterized by how they modify\nthe epidemic threshold and the final epidemic size (or epidemic prevalence). For example,\nBagnoli et al.26 assumed\nthat individuals' risk perception of epidemic is an exponential function of local and global\ninformation, and they showed that a nonlinear increase in the perception risk can lead to\nextinction of the disease. Funk et al.17 studied the impacts of awareness spread on both epidemic threshold\nand prevalence and found that, in a well-mixed population, spread of awareness can reduce\nthe outbreak size but does not tend to affect the epidemic threshold. This result, however,\ndoes not appear to hold for social networks for which the mixed-population assumption is not\nvalid. In particular, Wu et al.24 compared the roles of the three forms of information-based\nawareness, i.e., local, global, and contact awareness, in the epidemic threshold, and\nconcluded that global awareness cannot alter the epidemic threshold, while both local and\ncontact awareness can. Sahneh et al.6,7 proved that local information-based response can enhance the\nepidemic threshold and reduce the prevalence, given that the probability of susceptible\nindividuals to alter their state is proportional to the number of the infected\nneighbors.",

First, a general result from\nprevious works is that the local information-based responses can enhance the epidemic\nthreshold and reduce its prevalence, but global information-based awareness, although being\ncapable of altering the epidemic size, has little effect on the threshold.6,24,25 In these works on the interplay\nbetween epidemic spreading in complex networks and human behavioral responses, a tacit\nhypothesis24\u201326,28 is that\nlocal information-based behavioral response is a function of the density of infection among\nthe local neighborhood, denoted as s/k, where\ns is the number of infected neighbors among a total of k\nneighbors. However, simple situations can be conceived where this assumption does not hold.\nFor example, consider two nodes in a complex network, i and\nj, which have 10 and 100 neighbors, respectively. Assume that in their\nrespective neighborhoods, there are 5 and 50 infected nodes. The hypothesis would then\nassign the two nodes with the same value of s/k, or\nidentical risk perception. However, common sense stipulates that node j,\nbecause of the much larger number of infected neighbors, should have stronger awareness\nabout the epidemic than node i. A real-world example is some popular\nwebsites or important network routers that have a large probability of being attacked by\nvirus. As a result, for various reasons they tend to be much better protected.",

A key difference between SIS and SIR dynamics is that the former is\nreversible while the latter is irreversible.29,30 Another difference is that, for SIS dynamics, the system can\nonly reach a dynamically steady state since the propagation process always\noccurs once the transmission rate exceeds the epidemic threshold. However, for the SIR\nprocess, propagation will terminate once there are no longer infected nodes in the network.\nThese differences can lead to different interplay between the epidemic dynamics and\nbehavioral response, demanding a systematic comparison study.",

In particular, we assume that individuals generate\nbehavioral responses by reducing their contact rates, depending on the actual number\nof infected neighbors (not the density of such neighbors), and study how the\nepidemic thresholds and prevalence for both types of epidemic dynamics are altered. We find\nthat the mechanism generates similar effects on the SIS and SIR epidemic thresholds but lead\nto different epidemic sizes for the two types of dynamics. An important consequence of our\nrealistic behavioral response mechanism is that, for both SIS and SIR dynamics, the\ninfection densities can be maximized for some intermediate values of the node degree. This\nimplies that both small- and large-degree nodes are relatively more resilient to infection,\nin sharp contrast to the monotonic increase of the infection density with the node degree as\nin situations where no behavioral response is taken into account.31,32",

            "text": "Epidemic spreading is a fundamental type of network dynamical process that has been studied\nextensively due to the development of complex networks. In a network, a node represents an\nindividual and an edge between a pair of nodes specifies a contact through which the\nepidemic can diffuse or propagate.33\u201337 In the absence of any behavioral response, for an unweighted\nnetwork the contact rate of every pair of nodes can be conveniently set to be unity. A\nreasonable assumption is that an individual would become more cautious and therefore take\nmore effective preventive measure if many of the neighbors have been infected. The\nbehavioral response can then be modeled quantitatively by introducing the reduction factor\n(1 \u2013 \u03b1)s in the contact rate of a susceptible\nnode, where s is the number of infected neighbors and\n0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 is a parameter characterizing the response strength of the\nindividuals to the epidemic. The larger the value of \u03b1, the more cautious\nthe individual becomes, resulting a more substantial reduction in the contact rate. In a\nreal situation, the value of \u03b1 would vary across all the individuals in the\nnetwork. Here, for simplicity and for gaining insights into the epidemic dynamics subject to\nbehavioral response, we assume identical value of \u03b1 for all nodes in the\nnetwork. For the trivial case of \u03b1 = 1.0, the contact rate will\nimmediately become zero once a neighbor is infected, ruling out any\nepidemic outbreak. Let \u03bb be the original transmission rate along each edge.\nThe new transmission rate in our model is \u03bb~=\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)s.",

Since, for an SIS process, the system\ncan sustain a dynamically steady state in which the infected individuals are more likely\nto have their contact rates reduced after becoming susceptible again,48 one might intuitively expect the effect of behavioral\nresponse to be somewhat different. In particular, the intrinsically irreversible SIR\ndynamics can cause the system to quickly converge to a steady state. As a result, the hub\nnodes are infected relatively soon and they have no chance to make any behavioral\nresponses, limiting their role in suppressing the spreading. However, we note that the\nsusceptible nodes can adjust their transmission rates based not only on the number of\ninfected nodes but also on the number of recovered nodes, so as to greatly enhance the\nawareness of hub nodes and effectively reducing the probability of their being infected.\nSupport for this heuristic reasoning can be found in Fig. 6, where the final recovery density Rk\u221e\nas a function of degree k for the SIR model is shown. We see that, even\nthough the hub nodes cannot be completely protected from the epidemic, Rk\u221e\nreduces to a low level and decreases as \u03b1 is increased.

Using two standard types of processes in epidemiology, SIS and SIR, as\nprototypical dynamical model, we developed theoretical analysis to understand how the two\nfundamental characterizing quantities, the epidemic threshold and prevalence, are shaped by\nlocal-information based behavioral response. We found that such response can in general\naugment significantly the epidemic threshold, regardless of SIS or SIR dynamics, and we\nobtained an explicit expression for the augmentation factor. This means that individual\nbehavioral responses can make the whole network much more resilient to epidemic outbreak. In\nthe case where outbreak has occurred, the final epidemic size, or epidemic prevalence, can\nbe reduced.",

The hub\nnodes thus play the role of \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d in epidemic dynamics as they can either\nsuppress or promote outbreak, depending on how they respond to epidemic.
