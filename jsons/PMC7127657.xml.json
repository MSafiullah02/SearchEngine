The news outlets have latched onto this hot item and have been bombarding the public with information that is both legitimate and misleading. The internet age has allowed rapid dissemination of such information, therefore causing rapid reactions or responses by both national and international agencies, regulatory bodies and professional organizations. The story of the impact the Zika virus has played upon humanity is an interesting and unique one, which has led to the government issuing non-traditional recommendations, in an effort to ensure the public's safety and health. Tracing the sequence of events from the discovery of the virus to the current state of affairs provides a useful learning tool that would allow effective responses during unexpected pandemics. Although there are over 325 published articles associated with the Zika virus, the majority coming out of Uganda, there is still little known about the potential of the virus [1].",

It is known to have spread to various geographic areas of Asia and the Pacific Islands, with the most recent spread eastward to the Americas. Earlier, symptoms associated with infection included a mild response, which included fever and fatigue, until this year when it was reported that pregnant women, primarily Brazilian women, that tested positive with the Zika virus had fetuses born with brain defects. After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory virus (MERV), the Ebola outbreak, and recurrent re-emergence of measles, influenza, dengue and cholera throughout the globe, the world now has a new enemy to contend with, serving as a reminder that human beings live in a complex relationship with other organisms in an ecosystem that is often unpredictable [2]. The continuous encroachment of otherwise forested and/or remote habitats by humans in search of new space for housing and adventure combined with the ever increasing speed of inter-continental air travel logarithmically increases the likelihood of the jumping of microbial species from its natural habitat to urban locations. This is a reality to be faced by those involved in public health safety and will remain a continuing challenge to health care providers worldwide.",

            "text": "Several viruses were reported to have been isolated by a team of British and American scientists that were in charge of the Yellow Fever Virus Research Institute housed in Entebbe, Uganda during the late 1930's to late 1940's primarily with the aim of isolating yellow fever viruses (YFV) [3]. In efforts to isolate the YFV, these scientists placed Asian species rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in sentinel cages atop forest canopy level platforms in the Zika Forest area located near Entebbe, Uganda, presumably in a location where they could serve as potential hosts for the local mosquito population known to be vectors of the YFV. Blood samples isolated from one of these \u201csentinel\u201d rhesus macaques (monkey 766) when injected into the brains of Swiss albino mice led to sickness of these mice. Homogenates of brain tissues from these sick mice led to the isolation of several filterable viruses, amongst one that was called the Zika virus766 because of the forest and the number of the monkey (hence, its name) [4], [5]. These viruses were also isolated from mosquito populations from the same location and thus reasoned to be circulating and being kept endemic by virus host interactions between the indigenous monkey species (that include 13 species with the colobus species monkey being predominant) and mosquitoes. The fact that the virus was isolated from \u201csentinel\u201d Asian rhesus macaques implies that there must have been an adaptation of the virus from the African monkey species to the Asian monkey species (jumping of species). Whether such adaptation was instrumental in further transmission of this virus and whether such adaptation led to increased pathogenicity remains unknown. It should be noted that sera collected from blood samples of several local individuals residing in the same area during the same time period were found to contain antibodies against the Zika virus presumably suggesting that the virus was already circulating in the human population. However, there were no reports of any disease. What is not clear is the specificity of the antibody test that was utilized at the time since there is considerable cross reactivity among the flaviviruses. It was first isolated from a human in 1969 in Nigeria, though the illness caused by the virus, Zika fever or Zika disease has been known to infect humans since the early 1950s [6]. A time line of the history of the Zika virus is shown in Fig. 1\n; the countries involved are shown in Table 1\n.",

Flaviviruses belong to a group of viruses labeled as \u201carborviruses\u201d, which is a descriptive term that refers to hundreds of RNA viruses which rely on arthropods such as mosquitoes or ticks for transmission. Arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses) cause some of the most devastating diseases in humans and animals worldwide. The families of RNA arboviruses include Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Togoviridae. The arboviruses are acquired orally by their hematogenous vectors in the form of a blood meal of an infected vertebrate host. These viruses are non-pathogenic to the vector but have to be able to survive in a live form in the vector which then transmits via saliva deposition into a new vertebrate host. This cycle is important to remember since the details of how the virus survives in the vector host and whether it replicates in the vector host, and if it replicates, the cell types that it infects in the vector and whether the virus changes in any form in the vector host (such as glycosylation of its envelope for example) are all important issues that influence the ability of the vector to transmit infection including the Zika virus. Evidence for recombination of the virus has already been documented to have potentially occurred by transmission of the virus via a different species of mosquitoes [10]. The Zika virus is closely related to the Spondweni virus. There are a total of seven groups of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The groups are categorized based on antigenic and genetic considerations. The genus Flavivirus consists of 39 different mosquito-borne viruses [11].",

            "text": "The Zika virus is composed of a positive sense, single strand RNA genome. It is an enveloped, icosahedral virus that is a member of the Spondweni clade. The Zika virus is a positive polarity RNA virus with a genomic size of about 11 kb [12]. The single open reading frame sequence of its RNA genome encodes a polyprotein which constitutes the structural architecture of the virus [13]. This polyprotein contains 3 components, including a capsid (105 aa), membrane and premembrane portion (187 aa) termed C, M and P, respectively. There is also an envelope protein (E, 505 aa) and an addition 7 components that are non-structural (NS). These seven proteins are designated NS1 (352 aa), NS2a (217 aa), ND2b (139 aa), NS3 (619 aa), NS4a (127 aa), NS4b (255 aa) and NS5 904 aa) [14]. The non-structural proteins NS2B/NS3 includes a serine protease that along with host proteases co-translationally and post-translation cleaves the polyprotein into its components. The envelope protein is the primary flavivirus antigenic site and dictates attachment of the virion and penetration into the host cell. Folding of the E protein is controlled by the premembrane protein, which is cleaved by furin to form the membrane protein prior to mature virion release from the cell [15]. The function of the remaining non-structural proteins remain unknown, but may have specific essential roles in various replication stages. For example, NS5, the most highly conserved of the flavivirus NS proteins functions as a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [16].",

This 4 amino acid sequence corresponds to the 154 glycosylation motif in the envelope protein that may play a role in virulence. More research is necessary to clarify the role of glycosylation in the pathogenesis of Zika virus infection.",

Thus, there were cases reported in various parts of Africa that included one in Nigeria in 1971, one in Sierra Leone in 1972 and more recently in the Cape Verde Island. The other route of spread was Eastward to the Pacific Islands and Asia. Multiple arbovirus infections were reported in the late 1950s and early 1960s in East Africa, including Zika, yellow fever, Banzi, Wesselsbron, West Nile and dengue 1 (group-B arboviruses), chickungunya, o'nyong-yong and Sinbis (group-A arboviruses), and Bunyamwera virus [23]. Although known since 1947, extensive spread of the Zika virus to Asia probably only occurred as recently as 2012\u20132014 [24]. It is unknown what triggered the worldwide emergence of a disease confined to a narrow tropical band. RT-PCR based studies on the Zika virus suggest that genetic changes in protein glycosylation through recombination events may have led to a higher efficiency in transmission via mosquito vectors, thus facilitating changes in geographical spread patterns [10].",

The first case of autochthonous transmission of the virus in Brazil was reported in March of 2015 [28]. The increased incidence of microcephaly in infants born in Brazil led to the realization that there is an extremely likely association between brain damage and Zika virus infection, though even to this day this has not yet been definitively confirmed [8], [29]. In barely eight months, there have been over 4000 confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil, according to a report in the British Medical Journal published on the 26th of January, 2016 [30]. The virus is widespread in multiple regions and states in Brazil [31], [32], [33], and the reports of microcephaly coincide temporally with the appearance of the Zika virus in Brazil. Other Latin American countries have since reported cases of Zika virus infection [34], [35]. Tracing the route of spread, one theory is that the beginning of the disease in Brazil was caused by transmission from the outbreak in French Polynesia in 2014, which coincided with the World Cup football competition [36], [37]. In addition, it has been proposed that climate changes may have facilitated the spread of Zika virus to the Americas by virtue of the warmer temperatures and drought conditions observed in the second half of 2015 in South America. Drier conditions may have enhanced vector dispersal [38].",

It is reasoned that most of these arboviruses remain endemic in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world that promote the life cycle of the arthropod. In most, if not all such cases, the virus in question does not cause any disease in its natural host. Thus, the infectious virus has to be present in sufficient quantity in the blood/tissues of the vertebrate host so that it is picked up by the arthropod when it bites the natural host. The infectious virus then has to survive in the arthropod and in some cases replicate in a specific tissue of the arthropod and once again be in sufficient infectious amounts to be delivered by the arthropod to another natural host to continue the cycle. Mosquitoes generally feed on plant nectars and it is primarily the female mosquito that feeds on vertebrate blood that is needed for the maturation of the eggs it carries. The average life span of a male mosquito is only 10 days and 1\u20132 months for the female and the range of a mosquito is 1\u20133 miles. Thus, female mosquitoes have to be transmission competent within this framework for the life cycle of the arbovirus to be complete. One study reported survival of the Zika virus for a period of two weeks in female mosquitoes, suggesting the stability of the virus in the vector host. As one may gather, these are rather stringent requirements for the life cycle of arboviruses and have evolved over millennia. It also seems clear that it is only when such viruses jump species (non-natural host), i.e. to humans, that we see evidence of disease often with serious pathology and, in a small number of cases, potential death of the host.",

The A. aegypti mosquito lives for 2\u20134 weeks, but its eggs can survive for long periods of time in a dry state, and are known to reintroduce large numbers of the mosquito after a cold, dry winter. Other diseases that are transmitted by the A. aegypti mosquito include dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. A. aegypti has been identified to be the main vector for arboviruses in the Pacific region [51]. In Brazil, where recent Zika virus cases have exploded, the A. aegypti mosquito had been known for its ability to transmit related virus such as dengue or Chikungunya [52].",

A. albopictus was believed to play a role in the Zika virus epidemic in Gabon in 2007 [54]. Because A. albopictus is present in Southern Europe, the WHO issued a warning to European countries to be on the lookout for potential cases of Zika infection [55]. An analysis of the transmission potential for the Zika virus by various species of the Aedes mosquito was conducted [56]. A. aegypti, A. albopictus, Aedes unilineatus and Aedes vittatus were all found to be susceptible to Zika virus infection. Interestingly, in this study performed in Senegal, A. aegypti was found to have low potential for transmission of the Zika virus, which was discordant with other findings from other studies and field observations [57]. Studies designed to define the range of vector species employed the use of murine skin explants that served as a barrier when placed on Zika virus heparinized human blood and the candidate mosquito species allowed to feed on such an in vitro culture system. The Aedes spp of mosquitoes were found to be easily infectable with the Zika virus using this technique [58]. Zika virus has also been isolated from Aedes africanus in the Lunyo forest on the shore of the Entebbe peninsula as early as 1948 [59], and was again isolated from this strain of Aedes mosquitos caught from various heights of a 120 m tower in the Zika forest in Uganda in the early 1960s [60].",

In addition, Foy et al. [67] has reported sexual transmission of the Zika virus to the wife of a patient who got infected in Senegal after his return to the US. The transmission was reasoned to be via semen but the semen was not tested. In this regard, it is important to note that Flaviviruses have been detected in urine samples of individuals infected with the West Nile virus with suggestive evidence that the virus was in fact replicating in these patients and being shed and thus thought to be infectious [68]. Similarly dengue virus RNA and non-structural protein of the dengue virus (NS1) has also been reported in urine samples of infected patients, but in vitro culture of the urine sample failed to show any evidence of replication competent virus. Finally, yellow fever virus RNA was shown to be present in the urine of a vaccinated individual [69]. More recently a case of sexual transmission of the Zika virus in Texas has been reported raising considerable concern among the public health officials in the state and at the CDC, Atlanta, GA. This was based on the isolation of Zika virus in the blood of a non-traveler who had sexual contact with a partner who had recently returned from Venezuela.",

Thus, previously serological tests have been performed for the detection of antibodies. However, it is generally known that there is considerable cross reactivity between the various flaviviruses and thus the specificity of the test becomes an issue. There have also been plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) tests performed but the problem with such assays is that the presence of antibodies in the newborn could be due to passively transferred neutralizing antibodies from the mother, making it difficult to distinguish infection of the baby/fetus. The more recently developed PCR assay can obviously be performed and yield valuable information. However, if the fetus was infected in utero with neurological sequellae including microcephaly, the period of viremia may have passed and thus negative findings may not be informative. Thus, there are clear challenges. These challenges are highlighted by the findings of the recent outbreak in Brazil. The latest data from the Ministry of Health, Brazil, shows that there were 4180 reported cases of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection. Of these 4180 cases, 732 (17.5%) have been investigated and classified. Of the 732 classified cases 270 were confirmed to have neurological manifestations but only six of these 270 cases were found to be positive for Zika virus. These findings have to be interpreted with caution as outlined above. There have been no reported cases of microcephaly from Southeast Asia (could be due to lack of clinical awareness) but the outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 and earlier in Brazil both did report associations of Zika virus infections with neurological complications such as Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS). It is clear therefore considerable challenges lie ahead in establishing a cause and effect and the mechanism of Zika virus infection and microcephaly. A case control study would be one answer.",

Zika-virus associated GBS, as stated above, has also been reported in French Polynesia [78]. The first case observed in December 2013 was published in March 2014 [76]. Subsequently, additional cases of GBS were identified, and the incidence was 20-fold higher than expected during the time coinciding with the Zika virus epidemic in French Polynesia [79]. GBS has been of significant interest to immunologists for decades because of the potential for disease induction via molecular mimicry; molecular mimicry has been a theme for induction of other autoimmune diseases as well [80], [81], [82].",

RT-PCR methods for the rapid detection and identification of flaviviruses, including Zika virus, were established as early as 1994 [87]. Original primers were derived from nucleotide sequences from the NS5 gene or from the 3'non-coding region. In 2008, an RT-PCR protocol utilizing sequences encoding the envelope protein region was developed. The detection limit was 7.7 pfu/reaction and the methodology was determined to be 100% sensitive in serum and specific by its failure to amplify genomes of 19 other flaviviruses [88]. In subsequent studies, polymerase chain reaction assays for Zika virus have mostly targeted the NS5 gene. The NS5 gene is chosen for primer development because this region displays a high degree of conservation among flaviviruses, while envelope protein genes may vary within a single flavivirus and thus present false negative data [89]. In a separate study, real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) offers a quick and quantitative method to detect and evaluate the presence of Zika virus in mosquitoes. A method utilizing the NS5 protein coding regions was found to show high sensitivity for 37 Zika virus strains and specificity against other flavivirus strains. At the time of the study, this methodology had been tested on field mosquitoes and not yet applied for clinical diagnostic usage [90].",

The role of the skin in the pathogenesis of infection carries potential significance as an entry point into the body. Adhesion factors including AXL, Tyro3, and DC-SIGN were found to facilitate Zika virus entry into human skin cells. The phosphatidylserine receptor AXL was in particular found to be an entry receptor for the Zika virus. Dermal fibroblasts showed Zika permissiveness using specific RNA silencing and a neutralizing antibody. Transcription factors involved in the synthesis of the innate immune response molecules RIG-I, MDA5 and Toll like receptor (TLR)-3 were each enhanced following Zika virus infection. The fact that Axl tyrosine kinase is expressed by glioma cells provides a clue for its role in the pathology characterized to be associated with Zika virus infection. More recently, a potent inhibitor for Axl (BMS-777607) has been identified [101], making this an interesting candidate for the study of therapeutic options. Interferon-stimulated genes were also enhanced. Autophagosomes induced by Zika infection of human skin fibroblasts was associated with increased viral replication using the autophagy inducer, Torin 1 and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine [94].",

Climate changes should also be taken into consideration when discussing vector abundance issues. Global warming is a factor that drives vector abundance, as may changes in humidity or rainfall. In past studies of arbovirus circulation dynamics, rainfall negatively predicted dengue virus isolation, but positively predicted Zika virus isolation.

Identification of resistant versus susceptible phenotypes of the mosquito can lead to the isolation of genetic differences. The artificial introduction of strains that are not only resistant to infection but also do not transmit the virus into mosquito breeding areas is a potential method to mitigate the spread of infection. While this is only in concept phase, genetic modification of wild type Aedes spp. may yet prove to be an effective way to help curb the global spread of Zika virus.",

There are also efforts being made to introduce genetically resistant strains of mosquitoes. Ironically due to the mild nature of most Zika virus infections, the infection often goes undetected and those capable of spreading the disease may not appear clinically ill, and would be difficult to identify, which provides a challenge.",

Previously believed to be spread only by mosquitoes, thus the classification as an arbovirus, it is now known to be potentially transmissible by sexual contact or blood transfusion.

Since the skin is the entry point for Zika virus infection, immune dynamics in the skin clearly plays a role in viral entry and infection. As the Zika virus spreads, the need for a vaccine becomes increasingly urgent. A better understanding of the pathogenesis will facilitate development of an effective and safe vaccine.
