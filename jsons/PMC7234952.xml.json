            "text": "In Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak from January 28 2020 to March 10 2020, 153 patients with 1,752 visits underwent radiotherapy in Zhongnan Hospital. Of 39 staff personnel with ages ranging from 26-51, none developed symptoms and / or molecular indication of COVID-19 infection. Thirty nine staff were examined with SARS-Cov-2 Real-time RT-PCR between February 20 and March 22 2020. All had negative results with the exception of one staff member who rejected the throat swab test. In addition, 35 staff were examined with the IgM and IgG tests (chemiluminescence immunoassay) for SARS-Cov-2 and all were negative. Four staff were not studied as they had left the facility in the interim. To achieve these results, we implemented the measures outlined below (Figure 1\n).1.Patients were informed of scheduled treatment times by phone and text message to reduce the waiting room density of patients. Patients were also informed of infection prevention strategies prior to arrival in radiotherapy.2.Screening for temperature, symptoms of viral infection, and contact history was conducted for patients and staff in a \u201ccontainment area\u201d outside of the radiotherapy center (Figure 2\n).3.A compulsory temperature check was performed each day on staff and patients. Infection hazards such as phones, keyboards, and doorknobs, were disinfected at least 3 times per day. An appropriate ventilation system is essential. Staff who are in direct contact with patients followed biosafety level 2 guidelines, wearing appropriate PPE which includes disposable gloves, disposable gowns, N95 masks, eye protection, cap, and shoe covers (Figure 3\n). Protection at biosafety level 3 is applicable to all individuals performing procedures with a high risk of being exposed to SARS-Cov-2.1\n,\n2\n4.Patients were divided into three groups: confirmed COVID-19 patients, patients with some symptoms but unconfirmed infection, and patients without symptoms. Patients were placed in different rooms at different times each treatment room was decontaminated prior to start of daily treatments and after the completion of daily treatments each day. Following each patient\u2019s treatment, the tabletop of the linear accelerator and the path traversed by the patient was decontaminated (Figure 4\n).5.Hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent SARS-Cov-2 infections. Staff and patients were required to wash their hands following the \u201cseven step guide of hand-washing\u201d 3 for at least 20 seconds or to clean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Hand hygiene was performed by staff before and after contact with patients or their surrounding environment; during steps of removing PPE; and before leaving the treatment room. PPE were disposed of promptly into a clinical waste bin used for infectious or contaminated waste. Staff wore an N95 mask when in contact with patients and a surgical mask at other times. Staff was instructed to wash hands before eating and drinking, before and after bathroom usage.6.Patients were instructed to wear a surgical mask at all time in the radiotherapy center. To avoid difficult breathing, we would open a window around the mouth and nose in the thermoplastic mask during radiotherapy. The distance between patients was at least 1.5 meters. All patients were followed up for 14 days to make sure there is no SARS-Cov-2 infection.7.UV irradiation is recommended for the cleaning and sterilization of air. 75% alcohol is recommended for surfaces, such as personal electronic, linear accelerator, treatment couch. Chlorine-containing detergent is recommended for daily floor and walls cleaning.4\n\n",

We hope these data procedures are found useful in countries and regions in different stages of the pandemic attempting to deliver high quality radiotherapy. In addition, there are serious questions being raised as to how to re-open aspects of health care after the initial wave of cases is mitigated. These procedures here demonstrate that even in the height of infection serious adverse events to staff and patients can be mitigated in a high volume radiation oncology center and may serve as a blueprint for going forward.",
