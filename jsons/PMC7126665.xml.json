Volumes were adjusted to 30 \u03bcl with sterile distilled water. Templates were screened for the presence of E. coli virulence factors coding gene by conventional PCR, using the primers described in Table 1\n. PCR cycling conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 93 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing for 1 min, extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min) and final elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. All PCR reactions were performed in an MJ Research Thermocycler Bio-Rad model PTC-220. The amplified PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2 % agarose gel with Tris\u2013acetate\u2013EDTA (TAE) buffer (Sigma\u2013Aldrich\u00ae). A 100-bp DNA ladder (CienMarker, Biodynamics) was used as molecular weight marker. Control E. coli strains for each gene (Table 2\n) and distilled water were used as positive and negative controls respectively.

Regarding the main enteropathogens causing diarrhea, ETEC, Rotavirus, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum have been reported in 75\u201395 % of cases of intestinal infections in young calves3, 13, 15. In general, pathogenic E. coli appears to be less important compared with other diarrheagenic pathogens, since it is shed during a short period of time, resulting in a low prevalence. However, this bacterium plays an important role in the occurrence of enterotoxic and septicemic colibacillosis, and its incidence and impact on morbidity/mortality of newborn calves might be relatively high3, 5, 27, 45. In Argentina, the role of pathogenic E. coli isolated from healthy and diarrheic calves has been previously investigated. However, these investigations have been limited to the study of few animals or herds and were conducted over thirty years ago. Ode\u00f3n30 and Barrandeguy et al.2, demonstrated that ETEC strains were commonly found in beef and dairy herds. Conversely, Bellinzoni et al.4, reported that pathogenic E. coli was not detected in any calf. In this study, pathogenic E. coli prevalence was 30.1 %. The differences in these findings could be due to regional variations, management and hygienic conditions, the age of the animals, or to the fact that the analysis of F5 fimbriae in the previous reports was determined only by serology, without searching for virulence genes with molecular methods. The present work involved a great number of dairy farms and calves, and was focused on the molecular characterization of pathogenic E. coli strains among dairy farms from Cordoba province, Argentina. Previous studies in the same dairy farms of Cordoba province investigated the role of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. producing calf diarrhea43 and the participation of E. coli causing subclinical mastitis12. However, investigations about the molecular characterization of pathogenic E. coli causing diarrhea in neonatal calves have not been conducted. The results of the present study provide new and complementary information about one of the pathogens causing diarrhea in neonatal calves in this dairy area.",

The use of PCR-based technology to identify virulence genes has become widely adopted to distinguish pathogenic E. coli strains from normal gut flora.

Nagy and Fekete28 reported that diarrhea caused by ETEC is considered to be the major infectious disease of newborn calves during the pre-weaning and weaning periods. Infected animals are important reservoirs of ETEC and their feces are the major source of environmental contamination with the bacteria, which are acquired by newborn calves soon after birth. Although bovine ETEC strains do not represent a real hazard to man and cannot be regarded as zoonotic agents44, the high circulation of such strains affects the productive capacity and efficiency of calves in artificial breeding.",

G\u00fcler et al.18, found similar results (44 %) for F17 fimbriae in E. coli isolates from calves. Nguyen et al.29, showed a low prevalence (16 %) of F17 fimbriae among E. coli strains isolated from diarrheic calves. It is important to take into account that E. coli F17+ strains have also been associated with extraintestinal disease and usually show other virulence factors associated with the ability to cause septicemia29. In Iran, Ghanbarpour and Oswald16, 17 found strains of E. coli F17+ isolated from septicemic calves (29 %) and from bovine mastitis (20.4 %). Thus, in our study, an additional PCR screening of extraintestinal virulence factors would be necessary to confirm the likely presence of non-enterotoxigenic F17+ strains.",

            "text": "After adherence to the intestinal mucosa, ETEC strains produce one or both enterotoxins, LT and ST, which are responsible for hypersecretion of electrolytes and water into the small intestine. In this study, we found that sta was the only enterotoxin gene detected, while lt and stb genes were not detected in any of the examined strains. These results agree with Nagy and Fekete28, who reported that the STa enterotoxin is produced in porcine and bovine ETEC strains, while the LT and STb enterotoxins are predominantly produced by human and porcine ETEC strains. Conversely, there are some reports describing the isolation of LT and STb enterotoxins from cows and calves. In Brazil, Salvadori et al.38, recorded 3.9 % ETEC possessing st and lt genes from diarrheic calves and Rigobelo et al.37, reported a prevalence rate of E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves carrying st (25.4 %) and lt (13.2 %) genes. In China, Huasai et al.20, reported that 15.5 % of ETEC strains isolates from healthy cows were positive for lt and st genes. In Italy, it has been found that all the ETEC strains isolated from diarrheic water buffalo calves had the lt gene but lacked st gene7. Finally, Acha et al.1, reported that the sta gene was not detected in any of the E. coli F5 strains isolated from diarrheic calves in Mozambique. Since ETEC enterotoxins are plasmid-encoded secreted proteins, the variation in the prevalence of these toxins could be explained by the existence of conjugative plasmids widely distributed among bovine ETEC strains.",

This work provides updated information on the molecular characterization of pathogenic E. coli strains obtained from a random sampling of dairy herds in Cordoba, Argentina. These findings would be important to formulate prevention programs and effective therapies for calf diarrhea caused by pathogenic E. coli.",
