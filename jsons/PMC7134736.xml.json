Therefore, for instance, the inhibitor concentration (EC50) value in Vero cells of interferon beta is not 62\u2014ie, 6500/105 IU\u2014times higher than the EC50 of interferon alfa, as stated,1 but only nine times\u2014ie, 29\u00b75/3\u00b72 ng; this difference could be clinically relevant in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic terms.",

In their calculation, a value of more than 10 000 was assumed. However, when the therapeutic efficacy of different drugs is compared, this assumption might be incorrect: higher than 10 000 might mean 10 001 IU, for example, for interferon beta and 100 000 IU, for example, for interferon alfa. Although such wide variations in the values are highly unlikely, they would imply indirectly that interferon alfa, which has a lower antiviral activity, is more interesting from a therapeutic viewpoint than interferon beta because the selectivity index for interferon alfa is higher.",
