            "text": "In 2012, ITP group of Blood Coagulation Abnormalities Research Team with funding from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Research Grant for Overcoming Intractable Diseases in Japan published a reference guide for management of adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [1]. The reference guide was based on the existing global standards on ITP treatment, as well as research outcomes and expert opinions, and reflected the experience in Japan at that time. A feature of the reference guide was clarification of H. pylori-associated ITP, which is a unique characteristic of ITP cases in Japan. The reference guide also clarified the criteria for starting treatment for ITP, as well as the treatment target and presented a flowchart of treatment, with corticosteroids as first-line treatment, splenectomy as second-line and other treatments as third-line, together with the respective recommendation levels. The basic concepts of management of adult ITP have not changed significantly since that time, and the 2012 reference guide remains adequately effective. However, in the reference guide, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) were positioned as third-line treatment, as these products had only recently been approved in Japan. Since then, we have accumulated experience in the use of these drugs, and their long-term efficacy and safety continue to become clear. Furthermore, in 2017, the indications for rituximab, which has been positioned as second-line treatment in Europe and the US, were extended to adult ITP in Japan. Conversely, the number of patients undergoing splenectomy is declining, and there is an increasingly large divergence between decisions made in clinical practice and the reference guide regarding the selection of second-line treatment for patients resistant to corticosteroids. There is also an accumulation of new evidence on ITP treatment, including administration methods for corticosteroids used as first-line treatment, namely high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DEX).",

The most significant revision is the new recommendation of TPO-RAs, rituximab,b and splenectomy as second-line treatment, in addition to recommending that each treatment is selected on a case-by-case basis, in line with the patient\u2019s conditions and lifestyle. These revisions were drafted and discussed by the \u201cReference Guide for management of adult ITP\u201d preparatory committee, and were created based on the opinions of the researchers and research collaborators on Blood Coagulation Abnormalities Research Team, Research on Rare and Intractable Disease. The main aim of this reference guide is for it to be effectively used in clinical practice, so we also created some practical questions together with recommendation based on literature searches and opinions of the committee. The recommendation levels for each treatment were determined using the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), as used in the previous reference guide (Table 1) [2]. Please refer to previously published our Consensus Report in the case of management of ITP with pregnancy [3]. We hope that this 2019 revised reference guide will be utilized effectively by physicians who manage ITP patients every day.",

The anti-platelet autoantibodies also induce maturation failure and apoptosis of megakaryocytes, leading to impairment of platelet production. In addition to anti-platelet autoantibodies, immune complexes, complement and cytotoxic T cells may also play a role in thrombocytopenia [4, 7\u201311]. Thus, ITP is regarded as a syndrome that involves various immunological abnormalities, and ITP treatment mainly aims to (i) inhibit production of anti-platelet autoantibodies, (ii) inhibit platelet destruction and phagocytosis, and (iii) recover platelet production. However, at present, the inability to accurately ascertain the mechanism of thrombocytopenia of individual patients is an impediment for treatment selection.",

The medical interview should also take note of the presence/absence of bleeding symptoms and the characteristics of these symptoms. The purpura seen in ITP often ranges from petechiae to ecchymosis. Mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, etc.) is often seen in serious cases of thrombocytopenia, where the platelet count has fallen to \u2264 10,000/\u03bcL, and fatal cerebral hemorrhage occurs in around 1% of adult cases and around 0.4% of pediatric cases [12]. Deep bleeding, such as intraarticular bleeding and intramuscular bleeding, is rare. Many adult cases with chronic ITP lack bleeding symptoms.",

            "text": "\nLaboratory tests\ni.Peripheral blood: it is important to carefully monitor peripheral blood smears together with the blood count. Platelet aggregates are seen in pseudothrombocytopenia. The size of the platelets often increases in ITP, but when there is a notable increase in giant platelets, the condition may be caused by Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome or MYH9-related disorders (May\u2013Hegglin anomaly, etc.). The presence of schistocytes is suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).ii.Bone marrow examination: bone marrow examination is important to rule out leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as thrombocytopenia caused by bone marrow hypoplasia, but there are no findings specific to ITP and it is not considered to be an essential for the diagnosis of ITP [13]. However, the examination of bone marrow should be performed to rule out other diseases when abnormalities are found in erythrocytes or leukocytes, or in patients resistant to ITP treatments.iii.Percentage of reticulated platelets (RP%) and plasma (serum) thrombopoietin (TPO) concentration: The platelet lifespan is shortened in ITP, so the RP%, which shows the percentage of immature young platelets, is often high in ITP patients [14, 15]. The percentage of immature platelet fraction (IPF%), measured with an automated blood cell counter, is equally useful as RP% [16]. The plasma (serum) TPO concentration stays within the normal range to slightly elevated in ITP, but it is markedly high in thrombocytopenia caused by bone marrow hypoplasia. These tests may be useful for differentiating ITP from hypoplastic thrombocytopenia such as aplastic anemia [14, 15, 17], but they are not covered by Japanese health insurance.iv.Autoantibodies against GPIIb/IIIa (or GPIb/IX): Currently, PAIgG (platelet-associated IgG) test is covered by Japanese health insurance, but it has low specificity for ITP and the diagnostic value is poor [18]. On the other hand, detection of autoantibodies against GPIIb/IIIa or GPIb/IX, or detection of GPIIb/IIIa-reactive B cells (by the ELISPOT method) may be useful for ITP diagnosis [17], but only a limited number of laboratories can perform these tests, and they are not covered by Japanese health insurance.\n",

The mechanism of inducing remission with TPO-RAs is unknown, but possible mechanisms are as follows: (i) immunotolerance to platelet autoantigens may have been induced as a result of the increased platelet number by TPO-RAs or (ii) TPO-RAs may have improved the function of regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25hi) [73, 74]. Thus, when the platelet count is maintained at \u2265 100,000/\u00b5L, reduction of the TPO-RAs dose may be considered, while monitoring fluctuations in platelet count.",

There was no significant increase in the incidence of thrombosis in the clinical trials on romiplostim and eltrombopag [63, 79]. However, nearly all cases of thrombosis in users of eltrombopag, both arterial and venous thrombosis, occur within 1 year after starting treatment, and reports indicate that there are almost no new cases from 4 years post-treatment onwards [53], thus, it is essential to be mindful of the onset of thrombosis, particularly in the early stages of TPO-RAs treatment. Use of TPO-RAs should be carefully considered in patients with congenital or acquired thrombophilia, namely, patients with a history of thrombosis, hypertension, smoking, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, antiphospholipid antibodies, and in patients with cancer.",

Progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was a concern in an interim analysis of a clinical trial investigating the effect of romiplostim on MDS [82], but the results of the subsequent final analysis demonstrated that use of romiplostim was unlikely to increase the incidence of AML [83].

However, the percentage of patients who had a partial response with a platelet count of 30,000\u201350,000/\u03bcL was 57.6% in the rituximab group and 46.7% in the standard treatment group, with a relative risk of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.95\u20131.67, p = 0.11), indicating that there was no significant difference in the bleeding inhibition effect between the two groups. There was also no difference between the two groups in terms of onset of infection. In three of these five RCTs, rituximab was combined with dexamethasone and was compared with a dexamethasone monotherapy group, so the results reflect the additional effects of rituximab combined with dexamethasone [92, 93, 95]. In the remaining two RCTs, rituximab monotherapy was compared with saline infusion in a blinded manner, although both groups were permitted concomitant use of low-dose corticosteroids. These two studies address the clinical question as to whether rituximab is effective in corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent patients [94, 96]. There was no significant difference in any of the aforementioned indicators, including complete response rate, in the two RCTs. However, the time to relapse was significantly longer in the rituximab group compared to the placebo group (36 weeks vs 7 weeks, p = 0.01), so there are benefits for patients who respond to rituximab [96]. An investigator-initiated clinical trial in Japan found that 4 of 26 patients (14.5%) administered rituximab had a complete response, and 30.8% (95% CI: 14.3\u201351.8%) had a partial response with a platelet count of \u2265 50,000/\u03bcl [97].

Post-splenectomy infections can become more serious than normal infections, so early treatment is essential. When the infection is suspected due to fever or other symptoms, promptly administer penicillin-based or new quinolone-based antibiotics and carefully monitor the patient for signs of the infection worsening. Many patients who undergo splenectomy are refractory cases who have had long-term treatment with immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, so it is vital to be aware that some patients may have immunodeficiency associated with their previous treatments.",

Boyle et al. collected data on 9976 ITP patients, including 1762 splenectomy cases, and investigated complications associated with splenectomy [128], and reported that the incidence of AbVTE in non-splenectomy cases was 1%, while that figure increased to 1.6% soon after surgery, within less than 90 days, in splenectomy cases. There was no such increase from 90 days onwards, so the increase in AbVTE may be affected by the splenectomy procedure itself. In a number of reports on VTE, splenectomy cases showed an associated, but slight, increase in the incidence of VTE compared to non-splenectomy cases [121].",

One report has indicated that multi-refractory ITP cases are often secondary ITP with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or SLE [132].

Azathioprine is reported to have a 40\u201360% efficacy rate with oral administration of 1\u20132 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 150 mg/day) [134, 135]. Adverse drug reactions include myelosuppression, liver dysfunction, and pancreatitis.Cyclosporine (recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Cyclosporine is reported to have a 30\u201360% efficacy rate by maintaining a blood concentration trough level of 100\u2013200 ng/mL with two doses of 5\u20136 mg/kg/day [134]. There are also reports of small-scale studies that achieved a high degree of efficacy with 3-drug combination therapy with azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or by combining cyclosporine with high-dose dexamethasone and low-dose rituximab [136, 137]. Problematic adverse drug reactions include kidney dysfunction and hypertension.Cyclophosphamide (recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Cyclophosphamide has been reported to have a 24\u201385% efficacy rate with 500\u20131000 mg/m2 intravenous infusion repeated every 3\u20134 weeks, or 1\u20132 mg/kg/day oral administration [134, 138]. Adverse drug reactions include alopecia, myelosuppression, hemorrhagic cystitis, infertility, and secondary primary cancer. It is preferable to avoid administration in young patients who wish to become pregnant.Diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dapsone, 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone, DDS. Recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Diaminodiphenyl sulfone is known as a drug used to treat leprosy. The efficacy of this drug in treating ITP has been reported mainly from Europe since the 1990s, but the mechanism of action is unknown. According to a review published in 2013, which summarized eight small-scale prospective and retrospective studies, the efficacy rate is 40\u201360% and serious adverse drug reactions are reported to occur in \u2264 15% patients [139]. However, there are also reports that this drug has a lower efficacy rate (10\u201320%) [140, 141]. Known adverse drug reactions include hemolysis (DDS syndrome), hematopoietic disorders, and mucocutaneous disorders.Danazol (recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Reports on the efficacy of the testosterone derivative danazol for treating ITP appeared in the literature for more than 30 years [142]. The normal dose is 200\u2013400 mg/day, but there are also reports of low-dose treatments (50\u2013100 mg/day). Efficacy varies significantly, from 10 to 70% depending upon the report [134, 143]. A recently reported meta-analysis, which summarized the results of 12 reports and 224 cases, reported the efficacy as 58% (95% CI: 42\u201372%), and the complete response rate as 29% (19\u201342%), but many patients were administered 400\u2013800 mg/day [144]. Adverse drug reactions include liver dysfunction, amenorrhea, thrombosis, hoarseness, hirsutism, and androgenization.Vinca alkaloid (recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). The efficacy of vinca alkaloid has been reported since the 1970s. There are various reports on the specific vinca alkaloid used for treatment (vincristine or vinblastine), the administration method (slow venous infusion or bolus), as well as the dose and number of doses. The efficacy varies significantly from 10 to 86% depending on the report [134, 145]. Normally, this treatment is temporarily effective but does not produce long-term remission. Administration may be considered when attempting to increase the platelet count temporarily in patients non-responsive to IVIG [146]. Adverse drug reactions include constipation and peripheral neuropathy.Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Use of MMF for ITP is mainly reported from Europe, and an efficacy rate of 50\u201360% has been reported with oral administration of 250\u20131000 mg \u00d7 2 times/day [134, 147\u2013149]. The adverse drug reactions are relatively mild, but gastrointestinal disorders are common.\n",
