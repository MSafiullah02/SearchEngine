Clinical features of torovirus gas-P ! .001 troenteritis in 172 patients positive for torovirus were compared with those of 115 patients infected with rotavirus or astrovirus.

These were shown to be toroviruses because of a high concordance between the identification of torovirus-like particles by electron microscopy and a positive enzyme immunoassay with Breda virus reference antiserum [18] . Torovirus-like particles purified from stool specimens were further shown to be toroviruses on the basis of their morphology, immunospecific interactions with Breda virus antiserum, ability to elicit an immune response following infection, and the high degree of homology of the 3 end of their genome with that of the Berne and Breda viruses [19] . These data support the hypothesis that these toroviruses are infectious agents, but better evidence is needed to establish that toroviruses actually cause gastroenteritis. We therefore conducted two epidemiologic studies to determine the role of these virus particles in gastroenteritis. The first study was a case-control comparison of torovirus shedding in patients with gastroenteritis and in asymptomatic controls. The second compared the clinical features of symptomatic patients shedding torovirus and those shedding rotavirus or astrovirus.",

Patients were excluded from enrollment if they had an underlying gastro- intestinal disorder (e.g., Crohn's disease).

All stool specimens were collected in a standard stool specimen container (25 mL) and processed within 48 h.

First, the relative odds of torovirus among gastroenteritis cases was 3.1-fold that for controls. However, if the 10 control patients who became symptomatic within 4 days of sampling are excluded, the relative odds become 4.7, which approaches those described with enteric adenovirus and astrovirus [4, 27] . Secondly, over half of the torovirus-positive gastroenteritis patients developed an immune response to the virus. This suggests that the virus caused the infection rather than being a simple bystander or an electron microscopy artifact in patients with diarrhea. The higher frequency of seroconver-sion in older children in our study is similar to findings in animals reinfected with Breda virus and suggests a booster response to repeated infections [28, 29] . Finally, other known gastroenteritis pathogens were only sporadically identified in torovirus-positive patients. These were also found in children infected by rotavirus or astrovirus, established gastroenteritis viruses. The association of torovirus with acute and persistent diarrhea was recently reported in a smaller cohort of children in an urban Brazilian slum [30] . In that study, 33 children had acute diarrhea and 41 had persistent diarrhea. There were 17 controls.",

Although no deaths in the immunocompromised patients studied could be directly attributable to torovirus infection, enteric viral infections cause severe morbidity and mortality among such patients [35] . Among asymptomatic controls, torovirus was detected at a lower rate in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompetent patients (9.0% vs. 15.6%; table 2), whereas among children with gastroenteritis, it was more common among immunocompromised than in immunocompetent patients. This further suggests that the recovery of torovirus by the immunocompromised is related to the illness rather than to a proclivity of immunocompromised patients to carry this organism. Furthermore, this virus was a common cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients who were previously healthy. An outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in a neonatal intensive care unit due to particles similar to toroviruses (coronavirus-like particles) has been described [36] .",

Descriptions of illness in patients with enteric infection by coronavirus-like particles have indicated that diarrhea is the most prominent symptom, and patients often experienced frank or occult blood in stool [15, 32, 36] . A fatal case of gastroenteritis associated with coronavirus-like particles has also been reported [37] . Bloody diarrhea is generally not a feature of viral gastroenteritis and is more commonly associated with bacterial infections such as those caused by Campylobacter species or enterohemorrhagic E. coli [38] . Although low platelet counts in immunocompromised patients could predispose such patients to bloody diarrhea, almost half of the patients with this symptom were immunocompetent and did not have thrombocytopenia, suggesting that this symptom cannot be explained wholly by host factors. Studies of torovirus infections in calves (Breda virus) indicate that these viruses infect differentiating epithelial cells in the crypts of the intestinal villi, especially in the large intestine [10, 11] . Investigations of human torovirus infections are needed to compare the pathology of torovirus with that of other gastroenteritis viruses.",

While over half of the torovirus-positive gastroenteritis patients were considered to have a nosocomial infection, a substantial number were admitted for treatment of gastroenteritis. This suggests that torovirus causes gastroenteritis in the community. The Brazilian study identified torovirus in the community but other pathogens were also found, including enteroaggregative E. coli [30] . In our study, bacterial coinfections were predominantly with cytotoxin-producing C. difficile in both torovirusand rotavirus-positive patients. Other microbial infections, namely Y. enterocolitica, G. lamblia, and D. fragilis, occurred singly and of the 2 C. jejuni isolates from torovirus-positive patients, 1 child had bloody diarrhea. These findings are consistent with our observation that nonviral microbial pathogens are likely to have been rare in the case and control specimens analyzed in study 1.",
