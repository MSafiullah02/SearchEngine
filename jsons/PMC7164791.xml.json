From the time of laboratory diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained. We designed two different sets of primers generating overlapping amplicons (available on request). The first set consisted of 70 amplicons, 386\u2013800 bp in length, with all primers containing two strong Watson-Crick bps at their 3\u2032 ends, so as to bind the template with high affinity. The second set consisted of 68 amplicons, 415\u2013761 bp in length, with primers that had no more than two strong bps in their five 3\u2032 terminal nucleotides and no strong pairings in the two 3\u2032 positions. This method of primer design can decrease sensitivity, but it prevents mispriming within the product, which can improve the success of amplification. After RT-PCR, we sequenced all fragments on a Roche 454 Junior instrument (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) and assembled in Geneious (version 6.1.2). Virus quantification was done with standard calibration curves that were based on quantified in-vitro transcribed RNA for the upE target gene.9\n",

He was intubated on day 9 because of progressive hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (fraction of inspired oxygen 60%; positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm H2O). The patient had received intensive antimicrobial treatment with meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, caspofungin, aciclovir, and oseltamivir during his stay in an intensive care unit in Abu Dhabi, without major improvement in his pulmonary function.

This sample contained low concentrations of RNA, so the genome of the virus had not been successfully sequenced previously.8 After many attempts to recover RT-PCR fragments from the available bronchoalveolar lavage sample, we could sequence 12 fragments, covering 4012 nucleotides of the MERS-CoV genome (GenBank accession number KC875821).

However, renal failure due to specific viral infection or immunopathogenesis is not necessarily indicated, because the patient had received several doses of potentially nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents in a setting of underlying multiple myeloma. Post-mortem examinations are urgently needed to clarify whether kidney failure in MERS-CoV infection is a primary and preventable result of viral infection, or a secondary complication of severe systemic disease.27, 28\n",

Virological monitoring of the patient started only late in the disease course, at a time when the infectiousness of the virus could already have been reduced (as suggested by the occurrence of neutralising antibodies). The fact that we could not isolate MERS-CoV could have been due to the concomitant presence of herpes simplex virus type 1, which overgrew some of the diagnostic cell cultures. Furthermore, coronaviruses that infect people are generally difficult to isolate, particularly in late phases of disease. Only two successful isolations of MERS-CoV have been reported worldwide so far.1, 5 These isolations were done on day 4 of disease,5 and day 7 of disease.1 Our samples were taken on days 12 and 14, and the sample from day 12 was stored for 3 days before cell culture. Isolation success cannot provide any information about infectiousness of the patient.

Specifically, viral sequences from the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula cluster together and stem from one common ancestor whose date of existence is projected to be after that of viruses from Jeddah and Jordan. Date estimates will probably be refined when more sequences become available. Moreover, whether the reported geographical structure represents repeated transfer from a geographically structured viral reservoir population and limiting chains of person-to-person transmission or multiple sustained lineages of human infections is unclear. With only five complete genome sequences available as yet, genetic data are urgently needed to establish the spatial and temporal distribution of cases, estimate the number of independent human chains of transmission, and thus better assess the threat that MERS-CoV poses to world health. Four sequences from a continuing hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, have now been deposited in GenBank. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses confirm the clustering of viruses from the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula (Qatar: strains England2 and Essen; Abu Dhabi: strain Munich; Al-Hasa: GenBank Accession numbers KF186564-KF186567).",
