A limited number of procedures were evaluated, and even among those that were, a GRADE analysis determined that the evidence was of 'very low quality'. Nonetheless, after the meta-analysis by Tran et al (2012) , the WHO updated their list to only include tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, non-invasive ventilation, and manual ventilation, as there was only consistent evidence for the more limited list of procedures. 3",

The generation of aerosols from coughing has been studied and established. 8 Other specialty societies have produced similar statements, claiming that some of the procedures within their domain should likewise be considered AGPs. 9, 10 Which specific procedures are included on the list of AGPs is important, as it is agreed that HCWs should wear N95 filtering-facepiece respirators (or a higher level respirator) when there is a known risk of airborne disease transmission. 11",
