On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization issued a worldwide public health alert on the emergence of a new epidemic viral disease. On February 3, 2020, 17,391 confirmed cases (153 cases outside of China) have been reported (https ://www.who.int/emerg encie s/disea ses/novel -coron aviru s-2019/situa tion-repor ts/). The overall mortality rate of affected patients is difficult to assess at this time, because of the lack of a reliable denominator. Severe forms represent 14% of the reported cases, and the overall mortality is around 2% of the confirmed cases. To date, 153 cases have been reported in 23 countries outside China (overall, 24 cases in Europe), most of them being imported cases: tourists coming from China, or China-originating persons returning to their country of residence after traveling to visit family in Wuhan or other Chinese regions. In Europe, at least three cases in Germany and one case in France involved patients with no history of travel to China. The German case occurred after exposure to an asymptomatic contact coming from China [5] .",

Data from a series of 99 Chinese patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnosed in all patients by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), have already been published. Three patients out of four received oxygen therapy, 13% had non-invasive ventilation and 4% invasive ventilation, 9% required renal replacement therapy and 3% extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. According to the authors, 11% of these hospitalized patients worsened within a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure [6] . Although these preliminary data are insufficient to draw a clinical overview of the patients affected with this viral respiratory illness novel to humans, it is obvious that COVID-19 could cause severe respiratory failure requiring ICU admission.

Based on previous outbreaks due to emerging coronavirus, MERS and SARS, droplets are likely the major mode of transmission. Transmission from contaminated fomites close to the infected patient is also possible. Airborne transmission has been suspected, especially during invasive respiratory procedures. Personal protective equipment should, therefore, protect from droplets, contact and airborne transmission (see supplemental dress and undress procedures associated with photos and videos). The survival time of coronavirus on dry surfaces is no longer than 4 h, requiring regular environmental cleaning. A coordinated and multidisciplinary management between ICU, infectious diseases (ID) and infection control specialists, and also the institution, is of paramount importance. A trained supervisor is critical to ensure safe practices and reassure the ICU team.",

Diagnostic testing, if not already performed at patient admission, is the first task for intensivists. Etiologic diagnosis relies on rRT-PCR assays. Specimens from upper and if possible lower respiratory tracts should be collected (lower respiratory specimens likely have a higher diagnostic value). Upper respiratory tract specimens are obtained through nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasal wash. As per the lower respiratory tract samples, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimen is possible but it is not recommended due to the high risk that bronchoscopy poses to ICU staff. Plugged telescopic catheter specimen with or without mini-BAL, endotracheal aspirate, or expectorated sputum should be preferred. Additional specimens of blood, urine and feces and any other site if appropriate could be considered for delayed testing.",
