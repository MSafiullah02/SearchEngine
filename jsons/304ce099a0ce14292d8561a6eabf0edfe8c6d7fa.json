            "text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, a single stranded RNA betacoronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 [1] . Like all human coronaviruses, this virus almost certainly originated in bats and spread to humans via an animal, in this case possibly the pangalon [2] at a live animal market. Four other coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) circulate worldwide year-round but with increased case numbers in winter and spring in temperate climates [1] . These four viruses typically cause mild respiratory tract infections in children and adults. Severity is somewhat comparable to rhinovirus infection; paediatric hospitalization is far less common than with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. SARS-CoV-1, presumed to spread to humans from civet cats, circulated in 2003 only with 9% mortality [3] . Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), thought to spread to humans from camels, has circulated primarily in Saudi Arabia since 2012 with a startling 34% mortality rate [3] . The limited circulation of the latter two viruses is presumed to be because asymptomatic or mild infection is rare. Infected people are too ill even early in the course of infection to go out in public so generally infect only household contacts or health care workers (HCWs). Conversely, with SARS-CoV-2, many infected people are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet have a viral load in the upper respiratory tract comparable to that of symptomatic patients [4, 5] . This renders contact tracing problematic, enabling the virus to spread to at least 185 of the 195 countries on the planet by April 28, 2020. It is difficult to determine the effectiveness of school closures, bans on public gatherings, universal use of masks and other public health policies on spread of the virus due to variations in testing algorithms, the date on which SARS-CoV-2 became endemic in a country, the proportion of people already infected when policies were put in place and the level of compliance with these policies.",

Spread of aerosols is usually up to 1 meter but can be further with an unprotected sneeze. A surgical mask (also known as medical or procedure mask) worn properly by either the infected person or by their contacts is highly likely to prevent transmission. Nonetheless, the risk with a universal mask policy is that people are unlikely to consistently comply with the recommendation to wash their hands immediately before donning a mask and after doffing it and may touch their face frequently to scratch under or to adjust their mask. Cloth masks appear to be less effective than surgical masks but this could in part be related to wearing used or wet cloth masks [10] .",

The anti-viral agent thought to hold the most promise is remdesivir [46] , an RNA polymerase inhibitor with in-vitro activity against MERS [47] . This drug has been studied for Ebola virus disease but appears to be less promising than other options [48] . The largest study to date described a 68% response rate but lacked a control group so is impossible to interpret [49] . Lopinavir-ritonavir is a protease inhibitor with extensive use as an antiretroviral agent, but did not suppress viral replication in the initial randomized controlled trial [50] .",

However, by the time that the virus became endemic in the US in March 2020, it was apparent that most children could be safely cared for at home and only 147 of the first 745 US pediatric cases with known hospitalization status were admitted (20%) of which 15 (2% of all cases and 10% of those admitted) went to the intensive care unit[21] and 3 died (0.4% of allcases and 2% of those admitted).
