In recent years, frequent outbreaks of H5N1 subtype avian influenza infections in humans have caused serious concerns (Chang et al., 2006). Although vaccination is considered the first line of defense, current strategies for vaccine design and manufacturing may not be sufficient to combat an influenza pandemic. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) are effective therapeutic agents against influenza viruses by targeting the viral NA protein (von Itzstein et al., 1993, Li et al., 1998, Moscona, 2005). The advent of zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has clearly established that NA is a valid drug target for development of anti-influenza therapeutics (Klumpp and Graves, 2006, Garman and Laver, 2004). Although these agents are effective as prophylactics and treatment of influenza virus infection, alternative treatments are needed as drug-resistant strains have already emerged in some patients who received oseltamivir treatment (de Jong et al., 2005, Carr et al., 2002, Gubareva et al., 2001, Monto et al., 2006, Yen et al., 2007).",

NA is also important for the trafficking of virus in the mucus layer of the respiratory tract so that the viruses can get access to the underlying epithelial cells (Klenk and Rott, 1988). NA is present on the surface of viral envelope and is composed of a tetramer of identical 60-kDa glycosylated subunits. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the structure of the head of the tetrameric NA (Colman et al., 1983). NAs from influenza A viruses are classified into two genetically distinct groups: group-2 includes the N2 and N9 subtypes that have been used for structure-based drug design (Varghese et al., 1983, von Itzstein et al., 1993) and group-1 includes the N1 subtype of the H5N1 or H1N1 strains. The structure of group-1 H5N1 avian influenza NA was recently solved, and it has suggested new opportunities for drug design because the discovery of a novel cavity adjacent to the active site that would close upon substrate binding (Russell et al., 2006).",

ATA has previously been shown to interfere with a variety of cellular processes. It was described as a general inhibitor of nucleases (Hallick et al., 1977). ATA has also been shown to protect various cell types from apoptotic cell death which was induced by a variety of factors (Roberts-Lewis et al., 1993, Benchokroun et al., 1995, Andrew et al., 1999, Tsi et al., 2002, Marchisio et al., 2003). There were also reports to indicate that ATA could inhibit various types of kinases involved in cellular singaling pathways, e.g., I kappa B kinase (IKK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Tsi et al., 2002, Myskiw et al., 2007). ATA was also shown to inhibit cytokine-induced JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Chen et al., 2002). Further, ATA has been described as a insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mimetic and could promote proliferation of cells in serum-free culture medium presumably through activation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway (Beery et al., 2001).",

These constructs were co-transfected with linear BacPAK8 viral DNA into Sf9 insect cells. In the Sf9 system, successful homologous recombination produces infectious baculovirus expressing NA proteins. To select single clones of recombinant baculoviruses, the culture medium from baculovirus-infected insect cell cultures was harvested and serially diluted to infect Sf9 cells in 96-well plates. Subsequently, selected virus clones were amplified in a 6-well plate. Culture media of infected cells were then collected and stored as virus stocks for the production of NA to be utilized in the NA enzymatic assay. Recombinant baculoviruses, i.e., Bac-NAWT(WSN), Bac-NAH274Y(WSN), Bac-NAWT(H5N1), Bac-NAH274Y(H5N1), were generated to express the wild-type and H274Y mutants of NA originating from influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and NIBRG-14 (H5N1).

For safety reasons, we intended to avoid generating and manipulating drug-resistant influenza virus mutants. Therefore, insect cell protein expression technology was employed to express several variant NAs for the study of their sensitivity to ATA. Both cell lysates and cell culture supernatants of insect cells infected with Bac-NAWT(WSN), Bac-NAH274Y(WSN), Bac-NAWT(H5N1), or Bac-NAH274Y(H5N1) had NA activity (data not shown). That the cell culture supernatants also contained substantial NA activity may be due to the fact that NA is likely to be embedded in the envelope of budded baculovirus particles as suggested by Mather et al. (1992). The sensitivity of these NA variants to ATA was tested using cell lysates prepared from insect cells infected by baculoviruses. In our assay, the H274Y mutation in NA of the H1N1 and H5N1 subtypes, i.e., NAH274Y(WSN)and NAH274(H5N1), resulted in resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071), the active ingredient of oseltamivir (Mendel et al., 1998), as indicated by a 191- and 885-fold increase in the IC50 values, respectively (not shown). Such results are largely consistent with a previous report indicating that the H274Y mutation in NAWT(WSN) conferred a 754-fold increase in the IC50 of oseltamivir (Abed et al., 2006). The IC50 values of ATA in inhibiting NA activity were estimated to be 8.7 \u03bcM, 18.4 \u03bcM, 5.4 \u03bcM and 2.3 \u03bcM for NAWT(WSN), NAH274Y(WSN), NAWT(H5N1), and NAH274Y(H5N1), respectively (Fig. 3\n). Thus, ATA remained equally potent in inhibiting the activity of the H274Y mutant forms and the wild-type NAs derived from either the H5N1 or the H1N1 influenza subtypes.",

To analyze the binding mechanism of ATA to NA2HU4, we divided the binding site of NA2HU4 into several subsites, S1 (R292, Y347, R371 and R118), S2-S3 (E119, R156, D151, R152, W178 and E227) and S4-S5 (I222, R224, S246 and E276) (Stoll et al., 2003, Kati et al., 2002). GS4071 and zanamivir inhibits NA by mimicking the electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions of substrate binding at three subsites (S1, S2, and S3) and hydrophobic interactions of the S4\u2013S5 subsites (Kim et al., 1997). The conformational analysis indicated that in the subsite S1, ATA forms a hydrogen bond network that is highly conserved for the known NAIs (Stoll et al., 2003, Kati et al., 2002, Russell et al., 2006) (Table 2\n). ATA also forms hydrogen bonds with Y347, R371, and R118 but not with the guanidine group of R292, which forms a hydrogen bond with GS4071 and zanamivir. An in vitro selection study demonstrated that the mutation R292K is the most common substitution in Group 2 NAs resistant to oseltamivir (Tai et al., 1998). The resistance results partially from the loss of a hydrogen bond from R292 to the carboxylate group of oseltamivir. This mutation would have little effect in Group 1 NAs because the carboxylate group forms an additional hydrogen bond with Y347 (Russell et al., 2006).",

In addition, the carboxyl group of ATA appears to form new hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atoms of R156 in a bidentate hydrogen bond donor\u2013acceptor mode. On the other hand, the known NAIs GS4071 and zanamivir utilized the amino group to form strong charge\u2013charge type hydrogen bond interactions with E119 and D151 (Kim et al., 1997). The 2-hydroxybenzoic acid group of ATA has steric interactions with the hydrocarbon chains of I222, R224, S246 and E276 that constitute a hydrophobic pocket in S4 and S5 and is related to the inhibition of NA by ATA (Russell et al., 2006, Kim et al., 1997). The H274 amino acid residue that is mutated in GS4017-resistant influenza strains is positioned in this pocket (Russell et al., 2006, Le et al., 2005). The H274Y mutation could perturb the rearrangement space of E276, leading to increased resistance to GS4071 (Varghese et al., 1998, Yen et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2002). Upon comparison of the orientations of the substitution groups of GS4071 and ATA in this pocket, we observed that ATA binding allows for more rearrangement space for E276.",

            "text": "There is an urgent need for new anti-influenza therapeutics and the objective of this study was to identify novel NA inhibitors whose chemical structures are distinct from that of sialic acid. After screening approximately 2000 structurally diverse compounds, we found that ATA has potent inhibitory activity for NA. ATA has previously been found to inhibit influenza virus replication and the mechanism of action was attributed to the inhibition of influenza viral polymerases activity by ATA (Steward et al., 1977, Liao et al., 1975). In these previous studies, ATA was shown to inhibit viral polymerase in in vitro assays using purified influenza virus protein. However, we have tested the inhibitory activity of ATA against influenza viral polymerase using a cell-based assay and we found that ATA did not inhibit influenza polymerase. In this assay, we added ATA to human embryonic kidney 293 cells co-expressing influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) polymerase complex proteins including PA, PB1, PB2, and NP, along with a reporter plasmid, pPOLI-CAT-RT. The reporter plasmid, pPOLI-CAT-RT, contained a vRNA-like RNA encoding the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), in negative sense, flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions of the NS vRNA segment of influenza virus (Pleschka et al., 1996). To our surprise, ATA did not inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-derived expression of CAT at a concentration up to 12 \u03bcM (not shown). At this concentration, viral plaque formation was clearly inhibited (Fig. 2A). Based on the cell-based RdRp assay, we concluded that the polymerase of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) may not be the primary molecular target of ATA.",

            "text": "Our findings are reminiscent of previous studies on the inhibitory effects of ATA for HIV-1. ATA was found to inhibit HIV replication and the mechanism was proposed to be through the inhibition of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) (Balzarini et al., 1986). However, later results indicated that ATA inhibits HIV replication primarily through the binding of virus to CD4 receptor on cell surface (Schols et al., 1989, De Clercq, 2005). In addition to influenza virus and HIV, ATA was recently reported to inhibit other viruses such as SARS-CoV and vaccinia virus (He et al., 2004, Myskiw et al., 2007). ATA is a very strong inhibitor of influenza virus compared to its anti-SARS-CoV activity; the EC50 of ATA for SARS-CoV was 0.2 mg/mL (He et al., 2004), whereas the EC50 of ATA for influenza virus in this study was in the low \u03bcM range. It is interesting to note that the EC50 of ATA, measured in plaque reduction assay, and IC50, measured in the NA inhibition assay, were in the same order of magnitude. However, the IC50 and EC50 of GS4071 were less than 0.1 nM and \u223c40 nM, respectively, for influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Udorn/72 (H3N2), and the reassortant NIBRG-14 (H5N1). Inasmuch as ATA also has a pleiotropic effect on cellular functions (Hallick et al., 1977, Roberts-Lewis et al., 1993, Benchokroun et al., 1995, Andrew et al., 1999, Tsi et al., 2002, Marchisio et al., 2003, Myskiw et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2002, Beery et al., 2001), NA may not be the sole target that ATA interferes to exert its strong antiviral actions. Our findings are congruent with a recent report indicating that ATA inhibits the replication of vaccinia virus through targeting both cellular and viral factors (Myskiw et al., 2007).",

The molecular modeling experiments have been applied to examine the docking of ATA in its monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric froms since ATA was known to be present in multimeric forms (Cushman et al., 1991a, Cushman et al., 1991b). The docked conformations of ATA monomer, ATA dimer, ATA trimer, and an ATA polymer using GEMDOCK are distinctive (results not shown). We found that ATA dimer and ATA trimer lost some important hydrogen bond interactions, which are present upon binding of ATA monomer, GS4071 and zanamivir to NA (Table 2). Further, an ATA polymer, which consists of more than three ATAs, cannot be docked into the pocket. These observations imply that the ATA monomer might be the best form to inhibit the activities of NA among the ATA monomeric or polymeric forms. It is warranted to examine the exact binding mode of ATA and NA through crystallographic studies. An understanding of the exact binding modes ATA to NA would shed light on the design of a novel class of NAIs to combat influenza virus infections. The finding that ATA is a novel NAI shall prove to be important in the design of second-generation NAIs to block the replication of influenza viruses that are resistant to oseltamivir treatment.",
