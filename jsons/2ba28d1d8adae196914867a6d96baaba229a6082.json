During this response, an explosive production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 IL-1\u03b2, and others occurs, greatly exaggerating the generation of molecule-damaging reactive oxygen species (free radicals) (1) . In severe cases, the cytokine storm is responsible for the most obvious signs of a COVID-19 infection including fever, lung injury which causes cough and shortness of breath (and the long-term complication, lung fibrosis) and in death.",

Melatonin was initially discovered in and thought to be exclusively a product of the vertebrate pineal gland. However, in consideration of the identification of melatonin in prokaryotic bacteria (8) , from which J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 mitochondria evolved (the endosymbiotic theory) and the uncommonly high levels of assayable melatonin in mitochondria (9) , it was speculated and eventually documented that this indoleamine is synthesized in this organelle (10) .

Importantly, endogenous melatonin production diminishes markedly with age especially in frail older Aerobic glycolysis is an important feature of highly proinflammatory state since it ensures the necessary high levels of ATP and the abundant supply of biomolecules to ensure synthesis and release of the damaging molecules that constitute the cytokine storm.

Moreover, melatonin has anti-viral actions against viruses other than COVID-19 (15, 16). The collective data, in addition to its very high safety profile, indicate that melatonin would be effective as a treatment for COVID-19 and support the recommendation of the published reports that encourage its use for this purpose (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Melatonin is inexpensive, non-toxic over a very wide dose range, has a long shelf-life and can be self-administered which Fig. 1 This figure illustrates the differential glucose metabolism in a healthy macrophage and in a COVID-19-activated macrophage. In a healthy macrophage, pyruvate, a glucose metabolite, enters the mitochondria where it is enzymatically converted to acetyl-coenzyme A by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Acetyl-coenzyme A feeds the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and supports oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Additionally, acetylcoenzyme A is an essential co-factor/substrate for the rate limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). This allows for melatonin to be regularly produced in healthy macrophages; melatonin functions intracellularly and is released into the cellular microenvironment, but not into the blood. In COVID-19-activated mitochondria, via HIF-1\u03b1, mTOR, etc., the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is strongly upregulated and inhibits PDC (red X). Thus, acetyl-coenzyme A is not synthesized and mitochondrial OXPHOS falters with ATP synthesis occurring in the cytosol via aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Similarly, mitochondrial melatonin production is shut down so the cell is deprived of an essential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent and of an immune-enhancer so the elevated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines goes uncontested and the cytokine storm is a result. 5-HT = serotonin; ASMT = acetylserotonin methyltransferase; CoA = coenzyme A; IMM = inner mitochondrial membrane; HIF-1\u03b1= hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; NAS = N-acetylserotonin; OMM = outer mitochondrial membrane; PPP = pentose phosphate pathway.
