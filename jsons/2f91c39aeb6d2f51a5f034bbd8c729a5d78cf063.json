It is not possible to review all of the conditions that are considered to be interstitial lung disorders in infants and children; individually, they are rare and collectively uncommon, but important conditions and particularly challenging ones are considered. The major aim of this chapter is to increase the understanding of interstitial lung disease among pediatric pulmonologists, neonatologists, radiologists, and pathologists who take care of affected infants and children. Increasing the understanding of these challenging disorders should result in early and correct diagnosis, which in turn will improve patient care.",

            "text": "Although the true prevalence of interstitial (diffuse) lung disease in infants and children is not clearly known, an estimated prevalence of chronic interstitial lung disease in the pediatric population of 3.6 cases per million in immunocompetent children younger than 17 years has been reported based on a national survey performed in the United Kingdom and Ireland from 1995 to 1998 [10] . This reported prevalence is likely to be substantially underestimated, particularly given the increased recognition of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population in recent years, due to (1) a recently developed classification system for categorizing pediatric interstitial lung disease, (2) increased recognition particularly of the unique interstitial lung diseases that occur in infants, and (3) increased use of thoracoscopic lung biopsy in pediatric patients for definitive diagnosis. Additionally, although the prevalence of any single-specific interstitial lung disease is low, the combination of the varied types of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population may be sizable as a collective group. A national registry or large prospective multicenter studies focusing on the evaluation of the true prevalence of interstitial lung disease in infants and children is currently needed. the fact that interstitial lung disease is less common in infants and children compared with adults. Therefore, most clinicians and radiologists are less familiar with considering and recognizing interstitial lung disease in this patient population. Second, the clinical manifestations of interstitial lung disease particularly in infants and the young child are often subtle, highly variable, and typically nonspecific, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles, and hypoxemia. Lastly, there are currently no pathognomonic clinical or laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in pediatric patients. Some of the major uncertainties involving interstitial lung disease in this population include (1) the paucity of information regarding the natural history of interstitial lung disease in childhood, (2) the lack of understanding of the role of specific host factors in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease, and (3) the absence of information on prognostic indicators in interstitial lung disease in childhood and more particularly in infants. Due to the above-stated challenges and uncertainties, evaluation and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in childhood and particularly in infants has been markedly limited in the past.",

First, there has been substantial confusion and difficulty associated with the description and classification of specific interstitial lung diseases in infants and young children with multiple terms used for similar abnormalities and sometimes the same term used for differing conditions, and there has been a tendency to attempt to fit these pediatric disorders into the diagnostic schema used for adults. As the adult ILD classification became more refined and as more knowledge was gained about certain forms of infant ILD, it became clear that using the adult classification was both suboptimal and limiting as conditions common in adults are rare or nonexistent in infants and children and recently recognized infant conditions have no place in the adult classification. Second, the adult ILD classification system did not acknowledge the important role of heritable and genetic disorders that have become widely recognized as an important component of ChILD. The recognition of the role of genetic disorders of the surfactant system was pivotal in changing this understanding. And now genetic underpinnings are being sought for a wider group of ChILD. Classifying ILD in the pediatric patient based on the adult ILD classification system is no longer a viable approach.",

            "text": "Recognition of the substantial differences between pediatric and adult ILD led to the evolution of the current and evolving classification system for ChILD. A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force addressed this issue in a retrospective review of 185 pediatric cases of chronic interstitial lung disease in immunocompetent patients; most, but not all, had lung biopsy and histologic material, which was not reviewed as part of this project; the diagnoses made at initial examination were accepted. The ERS review divided the diagnoses made clinically into four categories based on a proposal by Fan and Langston [11] : (1) diffuse lung parenchymal disease of unknown association (drug reaction, aspiration, connective tissue disorders, infection, environmental disorders); (2) idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)), cellular/fibrotic, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), diffuse alveolar damage/acute interstitial pneumonia (DAD/AIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) to include familial cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI); (3) other forms of interstitial pneumonia to include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Langerhans cell granulomatosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, idiopathic/infantile pulmonary hemosiderosis; and (4) congenital disorders (DIP, LIP, lipoid pneumonia, NSIP/UIP, and surfactant deficiencies). Although this concept was an important step toward an improved understanding and diagnosis of ChILD, there was clearly a need for further refinement, particularly as diagnostic criteria were not provided for these entities, disorders of immunocompromised children were not addressed, and the requirement for chronicity excluded severe and rapidly progressive conditions. Additionally, adult terminology continued to be used in large part for quite different entities, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), conditions that are common in adults but vanishingly rare in childhood. This study was a major advance in redirecting thinking about ChILD, and it is important for this reason but does not truly present a new classification system, nor did it resolve many of the issues leading to diagnostic confusion.",

This new pediatric interstitial lung disease classification system was validated for infants and very young children in a retrospective review of 186 lung biopsies done between 1999 and 2004 [7] with accompanying clinical histories and images from children under age 2 contributed by 11 pediatric institutions in North America. The importance of this new classification system lies in its acknowledgment of the unique nature of ILD in infants and the overlap of other lung disorders seen in infants and young children with the varied spectrum of conditions seen in older children and adults. Based on this new classification system, ChILD is classified into three main groups: (1) disorders of infancy, (2) other categories (not specific to infancy), and (3) unclassifiable. This expandable and flexible system for categorization has gained wide clinical recognition. This chapter uses this classification scheme (Table 8 .1) as its organizing principal focusing initially on those disorders seen almost exclusively during infancy and not in older children or adults.

Due to their rapid clinical course of respiratory failure, most infants with this type of interstitial lung disease die during the first 2 months of life despite supportive management, including advanced ventilation support strategies, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and therapeutic interventions for PHT. Infants with acinar dysplasia, the rarest of these conditions, present at birth, and their survival is shortest. While most reported cases are female infants, male infants may be affected as well. Those with CAD typically present within hours of birth and require continuous and often maximal supportive measures for survival; with such support, they may survive weeks but cannot be weaned from these measures. Infants with ACD/MPV typically present within the first few days of birth, but a few have a delayed presentation at weeks or sometimes a few months of age. Once they present, their course with respiratory failure and PHT rarely ameliorates, and death by 1 month following presentation is the usual outcome. Familial cases have been reported in all and account for about 10% of ACD/MPV cases; they have been identified rarely in each of the other disorders. This feature has suggested a genetic basis for all these disorders. In addition, the majority of infants with ACD/MPV have other congenital anomalies most commonly involving the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (including absence of the gallbladder), and/ or genitourinary system. A search for the genetic basis of ACD/MPV has resulted in the recent recognition of the mutation/microdeletion of the FOXF1 gene in a proportion of ACD/MPV cases, and the recognition of familial cases highlights the need for genetic testing and counseling in cases with suspected ACD/MPV. As genetic abnormalities have not been found for acinar dysplasia or CAD, and as all ACD/MPV cases have not yet had a genetic mechanism identified, the definitive diagnosis of these developmental disorders currently rests on the pathological analysis of the lung tissue from biopsy and/or postmortem specimens.",

Histologic changes in ACD/ MPV ( Fig. 8. 3) are less clearly reminiscent of a specific stage in lung development, but there is lobular underdevelopment with variable and sometimes marked alveolar enlargement and reduced capillary density.

On laboratory examination, PAS-positive material identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be potential clues in the diagnosis of surfactant dysfunction disorders. Genetic analysis is considered the definitive diagnostic test, although lung biopsy is often done for categorization and for prognosis and treatment considerations while awaiting the results of genetic testing. Lung biopsy is also definitive for those without as yet recognized genetic mutation and often guides the workup of those with rare genetic disorders in this category. The current treatment for infants with surfactant dysfunction disorders presenting with interstitial lung disease varies based on the degree of clinical symptoms and the underlying genetic defect. Aggressive chronic ventilation for infants with respiratory failure is currently most often performed for infants with a SpC mutation, and lung transplant is the only effective therapeutic option for infants with SpB mutation. Those with ABCA3 mutations have a more varied presentation and course, at least in part depending on the specific mutation involved. In older children with ABCA3, there is a high incidence of pectus excavatum [32] .

These changes typically are described as one of several possible histologic patterns seen in these disorders, including PAP pattern, desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) pattern, CPI pattern, and NSIP pattern, all of which in this setting suggest an underlying surfactant dysfunction mutation. While each of these patterns may be seen with any one of the specific surfactant dysfunction mutations, PAP is uncommon and when seen suggests an SpB abnormality, DIP is more often seen with SpC or ABCA3 abnormalities, and CPI is more characteristic of SpC but may also be seen with ABCA3 mutations. An NSIP pattern is more often seen in older infants and children with SpC or ABCA3 abnormalities. Histologic variants outside these typical definable patterns also occur, but all are marked by the key features of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, an element of proteinosis and an element of lipid accumulation most often as a few scattered cholesterol clefts.

This recently described entity accounts for a substantial portion of ILD in infants. Affected infants are usually term and typically present with clinical symptoms of persistent tachypnea, retractions, hypoxemia, and crackles without substantial cough or wheezing by 3 months of age often beginning after an initial period of wellbeing and sometimes following an uncomplicated viral respiratory infection. Infant pulmonary function test may show evidence of substantial hyperinflation, and bronchoscopy and BAL are usually normal. The treatment for NEHI is currently supportive and aimed at preventing hypoxemia and infection while maintaining nutritional support. Many affected infants develop failure to thrive with time. Corticosteroids are not helpful for improving symptoms in infants with NEHI as an underlying inflammation is not a component of the disorder, evidenced by the lack of inflammatory cells on BAL or in the lung tissue at biopsy. Despite persistent symptoms and a prolonged need for oxygen therapy, infants with NEHI usually have a favorable long-term outcome with no reported deaths directly related to NEHI, no respiratory failure, and no progression to end-stage lung disease or lung transplantation. However, some patients with NEHI have longterm morbidity with persistent symptoms due to hyperinflation and reactive airway disease and may relapse with hypoxemia during intercurrent respiratory infection. These changes are present in all cases regardless of the underlying abnormality or the histologic pattern. While a variety of histologic patterns have been described in surfactant dysfunction mutations, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (surfactant C (j)), most cases do not present a single clearly defined pattern. An atypical proteinosis pattern is more frequent with surfactant B mutations (surfactant B (h, i)), a chronic pneumonitis of infancy pattern is more frequent with surfactant C mutations (surfactant C (j)), and ABCA3 shows proteinosis in a chunky fashion (r, s); however, no pattern is specific to a particular abnormality. While mutation analysis is the definitive diagnostic modality, ultrastructural changes in the lamellar bodies of type 2 pneumocytes can be quite helpful for more rapid categorization for prognosis and treatment decisions. These changes are quite specific for ABCA3 where there is a paucity of lamellar bodies (ABCA3 (p)), and those present are tiny, poorly lamellated and contain a dense central inclusion (ABCA3 (t)). SpB mutations also show characteristic ultrastructural changes with fusion of lamellar and multivesicular bodies (surfactant B (f)) and absence of tubular myelin (surfactant B (g)); there are also reduced numbers of lamellar bodies, which are typically poorly lamellated (not shown). There are no characteristic lamellar body ultrastructural findings with SpC mutations, the type 2 pneumocytes may appear normal (surfactant C (m)), or there may be mild changes in the size and distribution of lamellar bodies (surfactant C (n)) a b d c e",

It is very unusual for PIG to occur or persist beyond 6 months of age. Although PIG has been described as an isolated finding, it is more often associated with the variety of conditions that affect lung growth, the alveolar growth abnormalities. Most affected infants do not require specific treatment; however, in those more severely affected clinically, pulse steroids have been recommended. Clinical outcomes of infants with PIG are varied and are thought to be related to the underlying condition rather than to PIG itself.

On HRCT, diffuse, segmental, or subsegmental ground-glass opacities; interlobular septal thickening; and reticular change predominantly in a subpleural distribution with few centrilobular nodules have been reported. Recently, multiple small, variably sized scattered air-filled cystic changes in conjunction with diffuse ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and reticular change have been reported in an infant boy with PIG in the setting of alveolar growth abnormality (Fig. 8.9 ) [46] ; the contribution of PIG and of the growth abnormality to these changes cannot be apportioned with any certainty. The concomitant appearance of PIG with alveolar growth abnormalities suggests that imaging findings in these conditions typically share this uncertainty. however, occasional cases may show prominence of airway-associated lymphoid tissue and mild peri-airway lymphocytic infiltrates, illustrated in the right upper two panels with hematoxylin and eosin stain, which overshadow the similar mild airway smooth muscle and macrophage increase. With this quite bland background, the histologic hallmark of NEHI is an increase in the proportion of neuroendocrine cells in small airways (lower four panels with immunostain for bombesin), where they often appear clustered in small groups and sheets, rather than as isolated cells; neuroepithelial bodies (bottom right) may be enlarged and/or numerous a b c d",

Histologic diagnosis rests on the identification of increased numbers of bombesin immunopositive neuroendocrine cells in bronchioles and prominent neuroepithelial bodies in the lobular parenchyma in the absence of other significant pathologic changes. A recent study documents the absence of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia in the focally injured airways sometimes seen within these biopsies, suggesting that NEHI is not an abnormal reaction to viral infection, and another documents familial association suggesting a genetic propensity for the development of NEHI.

It is characterized by the expansion of the lobular interstitium by rounded, glycogen-laden undifferentiated mesenchymal cells without fibrosis, airway disease, or underlying inflammation on pathological analysis (Fig. 8.9 ). The interstitial cells in patients with PIG are immunoreactive for vimentin and are negative for muscle, epithelial, macrophage, and leukocyte markers suggesting that they are poorly differentiated mesenchymal cells. The most reliable means of diagnosis is the ultrastructural identification of characteristic deposits of monoparticulate glycogen within these mesenchymal cells. These interstitial cells may rarely contain small amounts of lipid by ultrastructural examination. PIG has been classified as diffuse or patchy; the patchy form is more common and is typically seen in association with alveolar growth abnormalities of varied etiology. ) Cases of PIG typically show at least some element of alveolar growth abnormality in the background, as seen in (b) with enlarged airspaces. In PIG, the lobular interstitium is widened by an accumulation of bland-appearing cells with abundant pale to bubbly cytoplasm (b-d). Other features vary depending on the underlying conditions affecting the infant. There may be mild and patchy alveolar epithelial hyperplasia (b-d); it is not a necessary feature and is almost never prominent and diffuse; there also may be pulmonary arterial changes of hypertensive vasculopathy (not illustrated). The large pale interstitial cells are immunopositive for vimentin (e) but not for macrophage or epithelial markers, suggesting that they are mesenchymal in type. Definitive diagnosis requires the identification of these large bland interstitial cells by electron microscopy. These cells widen the alveolar interstitium (f); they have bland nuclei and a paucity of cytoplasmic organelles (g), and their cytoplasm contains abundant monoparticulate glycogen (e). The cells stain similarly to the glycan-rich matrix of early fibrosis with Movat pentachrome stain (h) and as fibrous tissue with trichrome stain(not shown), although there is no actual collagen deposition by electron microscopy.

Such imaging findings can result from abnormalities caused by an acute infectious process involving airways and interstitium. Airway abnormalities (e.g., bronchial wall thickening, irregular aeration, atelectasis) and interstitial abnormalities (e.g., fine linear markings, interlobular septal thickening, small nodular opacities) can mimic interstitial lung disease in children with normal immune function. In general, viral rather than bacterial pulmonary infection results in imaging findings similar to those of interstitial lung disease in children. Clinical history, laboratory findings, prior imaging studies, and follow-up imaging studies can provide helpful information to differentiate abnormal pulmonary imaging findings due to acute pulmonary infection from those of underlying interstitial lung disease.",

These included pulmonary infection, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, connective tissue disease, toxic inhalation, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced lung disease, rejection in lung or heart-lung transplantation, and graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation, among others. In the radiology literature, in children, most commonly BO was described as following previous lung infection and BOOP was often seen following organ transplantation. When BOOP was encountered as an idiopathic condition, many came to refer to it as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. BO was considered irreversible, but BOOP often resolved, especially following a successful treatment of the underlying condition (such as acute rejection). The imaging findings described with BO were irregular hyperinflation and mosaic attenuation, usually with one lung dominantly affected and bronchiectasis (also referred to as Swyer-James or McLeod syndrome) (Fig. 8.10 ). BOOP was described as irregular hyperaeration, patchy interstitial lung disease, and scattered pulmonary nodules (often peripheral) (Fig. 8.11) .",

Affected patients usually present with nonspecific symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, these nonspecific symptoms can rapidly progress to severe respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support within days or weeks after symptom onset. Approximately half of the affected children recover, and half of those who recover do so without significant pulmonary sequelae. This improvement in survival is largely due to improved ICU care as there is not yet any clear understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition, and treatment remains supportive.",

Pulmonary sarcoidosis is traditionally classified into four different stages of disease progression: (1) isolated lymphadenopathy, (2) lymphadenopathy with pulmonary disease, (3) isolated pulmonary disease, and (4) pulmonary fibrosis. Affected patients present with a wide variety of symptoms related to specific endorgan damage. When sarcoid involves lungs, affected patients usually present with dyspnea, cough, and fever with a minority developing hemoptysis in advanced disease. Sarcoid does occur in childhood, although it is commoner in adults. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histologic features in the pediatric patient are not different from those seen in adults. (b) NSIP: CT shows ground-glass ILD worse in the periphery of the lower lobes with associated mild bronchiectasis. The connective tissue diseases, now called rheumatologic disorders and auto immune disorders, have myriad manifestations in the lung with histologic changes in the interstitium, airways, vasculature, and pleura. It is this multicompartment involvement that characterizes such disorders histologically, sometimes with more specific lesions that implicate a specific disorder. Pleuritis (c) is a common feature of these disorders and may be active with cellular infiltrates or be present as pleural fibrosis with less prominent infiltrates. Airway changes may include lymphocytic or follicular bronchiolitis, constrictive bronchiolitis with subepithelial fibrosis nar-rowing the bronchiolar lumen (d) and bronchiectasis. Chronic interstitial pneumonia (e, f) with alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and exudates is common and may be patchy but is often widespread; acute alveolitis and capillaritis can be seen in this setting as well. Features of organizing pneumonia are also common in this setting (g) with streaming fibroblasts in alveolar ducts. In addition to capillaritis, other vascular changes, including thrombosis (h) and evidence of recent (i) and remote hemorrhage (j) (iron stain) with hemosiderin deposition, may also be seen.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder with mutations involving the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Although CF is more common among children of European heritage with an estimated incidence of 1:2500 white live births, it can also affect children of Asian and African descent. Affected individuals are often discovered during infancy when they present with meconium ileus syndrome (18%), failure to thrive, malabsorption syndrome, or chronic recurrent respiratory infections. A definitive diagnosis of CF can be based on abnormal sweat test or via genetic testing, usually employing a panel of more common mutations in specific geographic groups. Although CF may result in significant gastrointestinal and liver disease, involvement of the respiratory system is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, and nearly all affected children eventually develop progressive pulmonary disease. Pulmonary disease is the most common cause of death in patients with cystic fibrosis. Imaging findings of CF vary depending on several factors, including the age of the patient, the duration and severity of the disease, and associated infection. Imaging Lungs can be normal or show mild-to-moderate air trapping (hyperinflation) and/or bronchial wall thickening in children with early-stage CF. The hyperinflation in CF patients results from the obstruction of the small airways (i.e., terminal and respiratory bronchioles) by abnormally viscid mucus. Imaging findings of later or advanced disease are characterized by the presence of upper lobe predominant bronchiectasis (in 50% of patients with lobe dominate disease) [52] , peribronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodular and tree-in-bud opacities, and mucus plugging with air trapping best detected on expiratory CT images. The reason for upper lobe predominant lung changes in CF is not known, but it has been postulated that decreased ventilatory excursions in the upper lobe may exacerbate the already impaired drainage of bronchial secretions. Due to chronic and recurrent superimposed infection, concomitant hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is often seen. Several CT scoring systems are available for an assessment of the extent and severity of CF disease, although they are not widely used clinically.",

In addition, reactive changes affect a wide variety of cell types with nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia, as well as bizarre nuclear forms. In both chemotherapeutic drug injury and radiation injury, changes may resolve spontaneously, or steroid therapy may be used in both to aid in this resolution. Or they may progress to chronic respiratory compromise with the degree of compromise being related to the degree of fibrosis. Death can occur in this setting, and risk depends on the agent and injury pattern.",

In the lung, it may develop at almost any time in the posttransplant period from as early as 3 days to years later but is more common in the first year, particularly between 2 and 9 months. Presentation is with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and sometimes with hypoxemia and decrease in pulmonary function. It is thought that infection, and possibly aspiration, may precipitate rejection events, as may lack of compliance with immunosuppressive therapy. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis often accompanies higher grade pulmonary rejection (A2 and above). Acute cellular rejection is assessed by the evaluation of the lung tissue obtained by transbronchial biopsy. In the lung, chronic rejection is manifested as constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis. Its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but the airway injury of acute rejection is thought to be an important factor. Clinically, there is a gradual onset of nonproductive cough and vague generalized symptoms, as well as progressive dyspnea and decline in pulmonary function tests. When this decline exceeds 10% of baseline, a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) can be made, and this is graded according to the degree of functional loss. When clinical diagnosis is uncertain, a lung wedge biopsy is done to confirm the clinical sus-picion; transbronchial biopsies are considered to be inappropriate in this situation as diagnostic yield is low for airway pathology.",

Occasionally, those with chronic edema mistaken for interstitial disease may have lung biopsy for diagnosis. Such biopsies show, in addition to protein-rich fluid within alveoli, capillary dilatation and congestion, leakage of erythrocytes, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and widening of alveolar walls and the pulmonary interstitium by edema fluid. Advanced changes are those of congestive vasculopathy. ",
