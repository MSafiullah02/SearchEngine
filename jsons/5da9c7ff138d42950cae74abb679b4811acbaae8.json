These results suggest that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of secondary ILI; there are several potential mechanisms for the increased risk of ILI due to shared latrine use. Both factors are potentially modifiable. Our results support exposure to indoor air pollution from environmental tobacco smoke as a potential risk factor for ILI. Exposure to indoor air pollution is a wellestablished risk factor for all-cause acute respiratory infections, due to its detrimental effects on respiratory tissue and immune functioning in the respiratory tract [31] [32] [33] . Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is also a well-established risk factor for numerous other conditions, including low birthweight, various cancers and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [34] .

Although shared latrines have not previously been shown to be associated with respiratory infections, there is some evidence of an association between shared latrines and diarrhoeal disease [38, 39] . Shared latrines may not be cleaned as frequently as private latrines [38] , so it is possible that pathogens remain present longer on surfaces in shared latrines compared with private latrines. Contact transmission, by either direct contact with infected fluids or indirect contact via fomites, may be an important route of transmission for influenza and other respiratory pathogens [40, 41] as well as diarrhoeal pathogens [38] . Contaminated fomites in shared latrines, such as doors and traditional pots used for anal washing after defecation, may provide a route of transmission for pathogens in Bangladesh. As ILI may be caused by many different pathogens, it is possible that shared latrines may expose users to a number of different pathogens that may cause ILI symptoms. Specifically, influenza viruses [42, 43] and coronaviruses [44] have been recovered from faeces of patients, suggesting that some respiratory viruses may be transmitted through faecal contact. Interactions with people with influenza have been shown to be associated with risk of secondary influenza [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , and ILI [26] ; it is plausible that those who use shared sanitation may have increased interactivity due to a commonly used resource (latrine). We did not observe an association between multiple daily interactions with the index-case patient and shared latrine use. However, we were unable to thoroughly investigate this possibility due to limited data. It is also possible that the association between sharing a latrine and ILI may be spurious or that latrine sharing represents a proxy for an unknown factor that is associated with ILI, but the effect estimates did not change substantially when adjusted for measures of wealth, age or smoking making this a less likely explanation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 328, "end": 331, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 403, "end": 407, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 722, "end": 725, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1149, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1153, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1176, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1416, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1426, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1431, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1436, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1451, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Nearly 8% of household contacts reported ILI in this study. This proportion is similar to previous investigations of the burden of ILI in the general population of Bangladesh [5] . Although age of the index-case patient did not modify the effects of household-level risk factors on ILI, in this analysis and our prior analysis, ILI incidence was higher in susceptible contacts who were younger than 5 years compared with those who were 5 years or older [26] . Residing in the index-case patient's household was not associated with ILI risk, indicating that all members of a compound in a densely populated area are at risk of contracting infectious diseases from their compound members or the community at large. Important limitations of this study include lack of detail regarding intravs. extra-household transmission pathways. We do not know whether pathogens were transmitted between members of the same household compound, whether they were acquired outside of the compound or whether the index-case patient we identified is in fact the primary ILI case in each compound. It is possible that control households had contact with intervention households and subsequently modified handwashing behaviour. However, our main study results do not suggest an association between handwashing and secondary ILI, so contact with the intervention arm is unlikely to have affected our results. As few participants had influenza, we did not test for other pathogens, and our definition of ILI for those under 5 years was broad, our results may not be relevant to influenza transmission, but rather, transmission of respiratory pathogens more broadly. Air pollution is a wellestablished household-level risk factor for respiratory illness [31] [32] [33] , but reliable data on concentrations of household air pollutants are not available from this study. However, we did observe associations between indoor smoking, one proxy indicator of air pollution and secondary ILI incidence.
