Her symptoms resolved completely by day 13, and she remained well at day 20, with progressive increases in plasma SARS-CoV-2-binding IgM and IgG antibodies from day 7 until day 20 ( Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1 ). The patient was enrolled through the Sentinel Travelers Research Preparedness Platform for Emerging Infectious Diseases novel coronavirus substudy (SETREP-ID-coV) and provided written informed consent before the study. Patient care and research were conducted in compliance with the Case Report guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Experiments were performed with ethics approvals HREC/17/MH/53, HREC/15/MonH/64/2016.196 and UoM#1442952.1/#1443389.4. We analyzed the kinetics and breadth of immune responses associated with clinical resolution of COVID-19. As ASCs are key for the rapid production of antibodies following infection with Ebola virus 1,2 and infection with and vaccination against influenza virus 2, 3 , and activated circulating T FH cells (cT FH cells) are concomitantly induced following vaccination against influenza virus 3 , we defined the frequency of CD3 -CD19 + CD27 hi CD38 hi ASC and CD4 + CXCR5 + ICOS + PD-1 + cT FH cell responses before symptomatic recovery. ASCs appeared in the blood at the time of viral clearance (day 7; 1.48%) and peaked on day 8 (6.91%). The emergence of cT FH cells occurred concurrently in blood at day 7 (1.98%), increasing on day 8 (3.25%) and day 9 (4.46%) (Fig. 1d) . The peak of both ASCs and cT FH cells was markedly higher in the patient with COVID-19 than in healthy control participants (0.61% \u00b1 0.40% and 1.83% \u00b1 0.77%, respectively (average \u00b1 s.d.); n = 5). Both ASCs and cT FH cells were prominently present during convalescence (day 20) (4.54% and 7.14%, respectively; Fig. 1d ). Thus, our study provides evidence on the recruitment of both ASCs and cT FH cells in this patient's blood while she was still unwell and 3 d before the resolution of symptoms.",

CD38 + HLA-DR + T cells were also recently documented in a patient with COVID-19 at one time point 5 . Similarly, co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4 + T cells (assessed as the frequency of CD38 + HLA-DR + CD4 + T cells) increased between day 7 (0.55%) and day 9 (3.33%) in this patient, relative to that of healthy donors (0.63% \u00b1 0.28%; n = 5), although at lower levels than that of CD8 + T cells. CD38 + HLA-DR + T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, produced larger amounts of granzymes A and B and perforin (~34-54% higher) than did their parent cells (CD8 + or CD4 + populations; Fig. 1e ). Thus, the emergence and rapid increase in activated CD38 + HLA-DR + T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, at days 7-9 preceded the resolution of symptoms.

This patient did not experience complications of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome, did not require supplemental oxygenation, and was discharged within a week of hospitalization, consistent with non-severe but symptomatic disease. We have provided evidence on the recruitment of immune cell populations (ASCs, T FH cells and activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells), together with IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies, in the patient's blood before the resolution of symptoms. We propose that these immune parameters should be characterized in larger cohorts of people with COVID-19 with different disease severities to determine whether they could be used to predict disease outcome and evaluate new interventions that might minimize severity and/or to inform protective vaccine candidates. Furthermore, our study indicates that robust multi-factorial immune responses can be elicited to the newly emerged virus SARS-CoV-2 and, similar to the avian H7N9 disease 8 , early adaptive immune responses might correlate with better clinical outcomes.",
