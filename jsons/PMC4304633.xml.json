            "text": "The series of flu-like outbreaks over the past decade illustrates the ongoing need for refinement of strategies to control and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases, including SARS in 2003 [1], the 2009 A/H1N1 (swine) influenza pandemic [2,3] and the emergence of a novel A/H7N9 (avian) influenza virus in 2013 [4]. In parallel to standard vaccination efforts, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are a critical part of the management toolkit [5-7]. In particular, NPIs become even more relevant in the context of emerging infectious diseases when the availability of a vaccine may be substantially delayed. Chief among NPIs are strategies for enhancing social distancing, whether privately initiated or policy-directed (e.g., closing of schools, businesses and public events) [8]. While behavioral NPIs appear promising, it is important to evaluate empirically their efficacy since they can be costly [9] and could have unintended consequences, such as leading to a net increase in the long-run number of cases or increasing the total cost of the epidemic and policy response [10,11]. The potential for individual response to disease risk and policy presents a challenge for the measurement of the infectivity of a pathogen and design of policy directed social distancing [12,13]. Ferguson [14] argues that despite the need for a holistic approach, current models essentially ignore the feedback between epidemics and behavior.",

Empirical investigation of the influence of behavior on flu-like transmission dynamics has been largely limited to binary proxies for behavior, specifically pre-scheduled [6,15] and epidemiologically driven [16] school closings and patterns of weekdays and weekends [17]. Though policy interventions are often coarse, individuals\u2019 responses to policy and their own private decisions about risk are likely more nuanced [8]. Fenichel et al. [18] show that private risk reduction may have changed in subtle ways during the 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic. Caley et al. [19] estimate the change in infectious contact rates in Sydney, Australia from the 1918 influenza pandemic but do so indirectly by inferring changes in contacts based on the estimated reproduction number and proportion susceptible conditional on a given value for the reproduction number, R0.",

The data reveal that proxy behavioral responses were greatest among children and wealthier socio-economic groups. Furthermore, we couple the behavioral response with an epidemiological model, and show that the A/H1N1 influenza virus was likely more transmissible than previously believed because the transmission potential was masked by behavioral responses.",

Following [17], we decompose a standard model of the transmission rate into the two components of a contact rate and average transmission rate per contact. To inform changes in the contact rate, we use a daily proxy for changes in time spent by individuals in the home, namely variation in home television viewing. While viewing is an imperfect proxy for social distancing behavior, this data has several appealing attributes. The data are collected consistently prior to, during, and after epidemics in all major media markets worldwide. The sample is representative of the local population (by design) and can be disaggregated into various demographic subgroups. Typically the data is collected automatically and electronically (as in our sample) and do not rely on self-reporting. The viewing data in our application were obtained from IBOPE International net-AGB Nielsen Media Research, the largest private research and audience measurement firm in Latin America.",

First, we quantify the dynamic nature of the behavioral response to the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and public intervention in Central Mexico. We show that the aggregate response is not constant and describe how it varies systematically over time. Next, we unpack the aggregate dynamic into demographic subgroups and show how certain age groups and/or socio-economic groups respond more strongly than others. Turning to the modeling of disease transmission dynamics, we assess whether accounting for daily changes in contacts better accounts for the variation in new cases. We then explore the potential for bias in the standard model from ignoring underlying changes in behavior. Previous simulation analysis has shown that intervention focused on children is particularly effective in reducing the attack rate of influenza [21]. We examine how accounting for heterogeneity between adults and children alters conclusions. In the next section we first show how the basic transmission model can be extended to incorporate dynamic behavior and then describe the data and model estimation approach in detail.",

These data are presented in Table 3 in Appendix A. IMSS is a tripartite Mexican health system that relies on a network of over 1,000 primary health-care units and 259 hospitals nationwide, and covers ~40% of the Mexican population. Importantly, testing rates for novel A/H1N1 influenza remained stable at ~33% [20]. Chowell et al. [20] show that the age distribution of the population affiliated with IMSS is generally representative of the general population of Mexico, rejecting the hypothesis that the distributions are significantly different. Furthermore they note that the male-to-female ratio among the population affiliated with IMSS (47:53) is similar to that of the general population (49:51).",

We set M equal to 50 for the standard model (one parameter) and 100 for the alternative models (two parameters). From this set of local maxima, the solution with the greatest likelihood was selected as the estimate for the global maximum. We estimated 95% confidence intervals for the parameters using the likelihood ratio method [34]. To test for statistically significant differences in performance, when comparing the SD model against the FE and DB models we used a likelihood ratio test, since the SD model is nested within both of the alternatives (FE and DB). Since the FE and DB models are not nested, the standard likelihood ratio test is not feasible. Following [35], we used a Cox non-nested test with a parametric bootstrap (see Appendix D for details).",

Outside of the shaded intervention window (\u03c4), this measure has a mean of zero (by construction) and typically falls within a range of +/\u2212 5%. During the period \u03c4, \u0394t shifts demonstrably upwards. This behavioral response is strongest in the first week (approximately 20%) before gradually tapering off to near zero by the end of the intervention period. This pattern suggests that the population\u2019s capacity for social distancing might be limited in duration; before the public health intervention concluded, there was a substantial decline in the behavioral response relative to the peak in the first week. (Alternatively, it may be that the level of viewing per unit of time spent in the home fell as individuals switched to other in-home activities.) After the NPI concluded there was a period of reduced viewing activity in the home (\u0394t < 0). Specifically, \u0394t reached its most negative point on May 10th at \u221210.5%. Outside of the post-intervention dip, \u0394t dropped below \u221210% on only one other day. As further evidence that the dip was likely not a coincident random event, we find that this dip persisted at 5% below the non-NPI period mean for four consecutive days\u2014there are no other instances in the data when \u0394t falls below 95% of the mean for more than a single day. While the causal mechanism behind these dynamics is not known with certainty, one possibility is that this multi-day period of suppressed in-home activity compensated for forgone social and commercial activities from earlier in the intervention period. The observation of reallocation of risky activities in time is common in the public health literature. Following the introduction of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS [28,36] find empirical evidence of increased sexual risk taking. Boyes and Faith [2] show that when alcohol consumption is banned at college football games that total alcohol consumption may rise through substitution effects in periods sandwiching the game. Finally, Graff Zivin and Neidell [37] find that while Southern California residents curtail outdoor activity on days with poor air quality, if the episode is prolonged the behavioral response dissipates rapidly.",

Estimates of the baseline transmission rate (\u03c10) in Table 2 show that while the DB and FE models are in essential agreement, the SD estimate is 12% lower. To explore whether this difference is idiosyncratic or systematic we re-estimate each of the three models starting with only the first M days of data for M \u2208 [15, 41]. We exclude the FE model for M \u2208 [15, 24] since this model is not differentiated from the SD model until the intervention begins on April 24th. In Figure 3 we present the resulting estimates of \u03c10. We find that estimates are variable but roughly consistent across models through April 24th. This is not surprising given that before the public health intervention began on April 24th our proxy suggests that behavior had yet to shift discernibly. After this point, estimates of \u03c10 for the DB and FE models remain roughly stable near 0.064 while the baseline transmission coefficient for the SD model declines monotonically. Thus over the intervention period when behavioral response is strong, the SD estimate of \u03c10 falls each day to account for the new factor. In contrast, models that allow for a behavioral shift result in estimates for baseline transmission that are essentially level over time.",

We assume that there is a four-day lag between the date of testing and reporting of all confirmed cases, a typical lag for reporting infectious disease outbreaks. Thus forecast error appearing in the figure for day M = 15 represents error made on day 19 conditional on case data that is complete through day 15. We assume that behavioral data (\u0394t) is available across this four day lag. From the raw forecast error in Figure 4A, it is clear that prediction performance for the SD model becomes poor relative to the alternatives shortly after the intervention on day 24. From this point on, the SD model leads to systematic over-prediction of the number of new cases. DB model performance deteriorates next towards the end of the intervention period. Finally, by the time the intervention concludes, all three models systematically over-predict new cases. This suggests that factors absent from the models considered here are important for capturing post intervention dynamics (e.g. personal protective measures to reduce risks per contact).",

Results from both behavioral models (FE and DB) suggested that social distancing was a key factor in constraining the initial wave of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico. In the absence of a behavioral response, the estimated counterfactual path of new cases escalated rapidly in initial weeks rather than stabilizing and eventually falling as was observed. The assumption of fixed behavior in the standard (SD) model led to shortcomings in estimation and prediction. Estimates of the baseline rate of transmission systematically shifted over time. If the baseline rate of transmission is interpreted as a measure of biological infectivity in the standard model, this is likely to lead to an underestimate of this parameter, as in our setting, given confounding effects of behavioral responses. This suggests that A/H1N1 had an innate transmission potential much greater than previously thought but this was masked by behavioral responses. This has implications for management advice including the allocation of resources between pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. Furthermore, the error in near term predictions of new cases through time was also substantially greater under the standard model compared to the behavioral models.

Or it could be the case that viewing per unit of time spent at home may be declining in time spent at home. Another explanation might be the inability at this time to empirically capture changes in behavior outside the home to reduce contacts or transmission (e.g. washing hands, wearing facemasks, and avoidance of coughing into open air).

Going forward, further detailed data on private and public behavior during outbreaks would serve to identify behavioral effects on transmission with greater precision. For example, we did not model the effect of antiviral treatment. Capturing additional behavioral adjustments made outside of the home to reduce effective contacts is likely be important for explicit modeling of the behavior underlying disease transmission. To this end, there is value in allocating resources during an outbreak to consistently gather data on public and private protective actions, such as antiviral use or the use of face masks. Although transitioning from empirical analysis based on fixed effect measures of behavior to fully dynamic responses at finer time scales will require additional investment in data collection, potential benefits include the promise of informing more finely tuned and less costly public health interventions.",
