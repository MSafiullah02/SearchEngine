However, existing reaction-diffusion equations for epidemic spreading are incapable of describing these effects. We present an extended model for disease spread based on combining an SIR model with a dynamical density functional theory where social distancing and isolation of infected persons are explicitly taken into account. The model shows interesting nonequilibrium phase separation associated with a reduction of the number of infections, and allows for new insights into the control of pandemics.",

            "text": "Controlling the spread of infectious diseases, such as the plague [1, 2] or the Spanish flu [3] , has been an important topic throughout human history [4] . Currently, it is of particular interest due to the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 induced by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The spread of this disease is difficult to control, since the majority of infections are not detected [11] . Due to the lack of vaccines, attempts to control the pandemic have mainly focused on social distancing [12] [13] [14] [15] and quarantine [16, 17] , i.e., the general reduction of social interactions, and in particular the isolation of persons with actual or suspected infection. While political decisions on such measures require a way for predicting their effects, existing theories do not explicitly take them into account. In this article, we present a dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) [18] [19] [20] [21] for epidemic spreading that allows to model the effect of social distancing and isolation on infection numbers.",

This issue arises, e.g., in chemical reactions in crowded environments such as inside a cell. In this case, the reactands, which are not pointlike, cannot move freely, which prevents them from meeting and thus from reacting. To get an improved model, one can make use of the fact that the diffusion equation is a special case of DDFT. In this theory, the time evolution of a density field \u03c1( r, t) with spatial variable r is given by",

The free energy is given by F = F id + F exc + F ext .Its first contribution is the ideal gas free energy F id = \u03b2 \u22121 d d r \u03c1( r, t)(ln(\u03c1( r, t)\u039b d ) \u2212 1) corresponding to a system of noninteracting particles with the inverse temperature \u03b2, number of spatial dimensions d, and thermal de Broglie wavelength \u039b. If this is the only contribution, Eq. (4) reduces to the standard diffusion equation with D = \u0393\u03b2 \u22121 . The second contribution is the excess free energy F exc , which takes the effect of particle interactions into account. It is typically not known exactly and has to be approximated. The third contribution F ext incorporates the effect of an external potential U ext ( r, t). DDFT can be extended to mixtures [46] [47] [48] [49] , which makes it applicable to chemical reactions. While DDFT is not an exact theory (it is based on the assumption that the density is the only slow variable in the system [50, 51] ), it is nevertheless a significant improvement compared to the standard diffusion equation as it allows to incor-porate the effects of particle interactions and generally shows excellent agreement with microscopic simulations. In particular, it allows to incorporate the effects of particle interactions such as crowding in reaction-diffusion equations. This is done by replacing the diffusion term D \u2207 2 \u03c6( r, t) in the standard reaction-diffusion model with the right-hand side of the DDFT equation (4) [52] [53] [54] . Thus, given that its equilibrium counterpart, static density functional theory, has already been used to model crowds [55] , DDFT is a very promising approach for the development of extended models for epidemic spreading. However, despite the successes of DDFT in other biological contexts such as cancer growth [56, 57] , protein adsorption [58] [59] [60] [61] , ecology [62] , or active matter [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] , no attempts have been made to apply DDFT to epidemic spreading (or other types of socio-economic dynamics).",

The ideal gas term F id in the free energy corresponds to a system of noninteracting persons and ensures that standard reaction-diffusion models for disease spreading [35] arise as a limiting case. The temperature measures the intensity of motion of the persons. A normal social life corresponds to an average temperature, while the restrictions associated with a pandemic will lead to a lower temperature. Moreover, the temperature can be position-dependent if the epidemic is dealt with differently in different places. The excess free energy F exc describes interactions. This is crucial here as it allows to model effects of social distancing and selfisolation via a repulsive potential between the different persons. Social distancing is a repulsion between healthy persons, while self-isolation corresponds to a stronger repulsive potential between infected persons and other persons. Thus, we set F exc = F sd + F si with F sd describing social distancing and F si self-isolation. Note that effects of such a repulsive interaction are not necessarily covered by a general reduction of the diffusivity in existing reaction-diffusion models. For example, if people practice social distancing, they will keep a certain distance (6 feet is recommended [86] ) in places such as supermarkets, where persons accumulate even during a pandemic, or if people live in crowded environments, as was the case on the ship \"Diamond Princess\" [16] . In our model, in the cases of two particles approaching each other, which even at lower temperatures still happens, repulsive interactions will reduce the probability of a collision and thus of an infection. Existing models can only incorporate this in an effective way as a reduction of the transmission rate c, which implies, however, that properties of the disease (How infectious is it?) and measures implemented against it (Do people stay away from each other?) cannot be modelled independently. Furthermore, interactions allow for the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. The final contribution is the external potential U ext . In general, it allows to incorporate effects of confinement into DDFT. Here, it corresponds to things such as externally imposed restrictions of movement. Travel bans or the isolation of a region with high rates of infection enter the model as potential wells.",

A possible generalization is discussed in the Supplemental Material. We begin our investigation with a linear stability analysis of this model, using a general pair potential, in order to determine whether a homogeneous state with I = 0, which is always a fixed point, is stable. The full calculation is given in the Supplemental Material. In the simple SIR model, the S-R plane in phase space (these are the states where everyone is healthy) becomes unstable when cS 0 > w, where S 0 is the initial number of susceptible persons. Thus, the pandemic cannot break out if persons recover faster than they are able to infect others. A linear stability analysis of the full model, performed under the assumption that the initial number of immune persons R 0 is small (which corresponds to a new disease) gives the eigenvalue \u03bb 1 = cS 0 \u2212w\u2212D I k 2 with the wavenumber k, such that this instability criterion still holds when interactions are present. This means that social distancing cannot stabilize a state without infected persons, and can thus not prevent the outbreak of a disease. As reported in the literature [35] , the marginal stability hypothesis [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] gives, based on this dispersion, a front propagation speed of v = 2 D I (cS 0 \u2212 w). However, there are two additional eigenvalues \u03bb 2/3 = (\u2212D j + j 0 \u0393 j U sd\u0125d (k))k 2 with j = S, R and the Fourier transformed social distancing potential U sd\u0125d (k) associated with instabilities due to interactions. Front speeds for dispersions of this form have been calculated by Archer et al. [92] . If both epidemic and interaction modes are unstable, the fronts might interfere, leading to interesting results depending on their different speeds.",

Since all simulations were performed with parameters of c and w that correspond to a disease outbreak in the usual SIR model, this shows that a reduction of social interactions can significantly inhibit epidemic spreading, and that the SIR-DDFT model is capable of demonstrating these effects. The phase boundary shows that, for a reduction of spreading by social measures, two conditions have to be satisfied. First, |C si | has to be sufficiently large. Second, |C si | has to be, by a certain amount, larger than |C sd |. Within our physical model of repulsively interacting particles, this arises from the fact that if healthy \"particles\" are repelled more strongly by other healthy particles than by infected ones, they will spend more time near infected particles and thus are more likely to be infected themselves. Physically, |C si | > |C sd | is thus a very reasonable condition given that infected persons, at least once they develop symptoms, will be isolated more strongly than healthy persons. Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the total numbers S(t), I(t), and R(t) of susceptible, infected, and recovered persons, respectively, for the cases without interactions (usual SIR model with diffusion) and with interactions (our model). If no interactions are present (i.e., C si = C sd = 0), I(t) reaches a maximum value of about 0.4 and the pandemic is over at time t \u2248 100. In the case with interactions (we choose C si = 2C sd = \u221210, i.e., parameter values inside the social isolation phase), the maximum is significantly reduced to a value of about 0.1. The final value of R(t), which measures the total number of persons that have been infected during the pandemic, decreases from about 1.0 to about 0.8. Moreover, it takes significantly longer (until time t \u2248 200) for the pandemic to end. This demonstrates that social distancing and self-isolation have the effects they are supposed to have, i.e., to flatten the curve I(t) in such a way that the healthcare system is able to take care of all cases. The theoretical predictions for the effects of quarantine on the course of I(t) (sharp rise, followed by a bend and a flat curve) are in good qualitative agreement with recent data from China [95, 96] , where strict regulations were implemented to control the COVID-19 spread [17] .",
