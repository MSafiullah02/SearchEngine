            "text": "Infection control measures have been present in various forms since early Greek and Roman times (Smith, Watkins, & Hewlett, 2012). The identification of AIDS caused by HIV in the early 1980s prompted the introduction of more specific infection control measures, namely universal precaution guidelines (UP) (Centers for Disease Control, 1982, 1985, 1987), to protect health\u2010care workers. In 1996, UP were revised and renamed standard precaution guidelines (SP) (Garner, 1996). Lam (2011) highlighted the importance of the revisions, which outline specific criteria to be followed to prevent cross\u2010contamination of disease between patients and health\u2010care workers. The original guidelines have been revised several times, usually in reaction to identified risk factors. For example, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette and safe injection practices were included in 2003\u20132004 to protect workers against the possible transmission of the coronavirus during the SARS epidemic, as well as the continued outbreaks of hepatitis B and C (Siegel, Rhinehart, Jackson, & Chiarello, 2007).",

Health\u2010care institutions are required to mandate the use of SP, but despite policies and procedures to enforce their use, health\u2010care workers\u2019 adherence to SP remains poor. Adherence to SP ranges from a low of 19.5% in the years immediately following their introduction (Kelen et al., 1990), to the most recent figures of 57.4 and 69.4% among nurses in Hong Kong and Brazil, respectively (Lam, 2014; Pereira, Lam, Chan, Malaguti\u2010Toffano, & Gir, 2015), to 81% of staff whom Tait, Voepel\u2010Lewis, Tuttle, and Malviya (2000) surveyed working with patients known to be HIV positive/hepatitis B virus positive. Adherence figures also vary with respect to specific aspects of SP, such as handwashing (19%) (Askarian, McLaws, & Meylan, 2007) and the use of protective eyewear (52%) (Madan, Rentz, Wahle, & Flint, 2001) and gloves for cannulation (54%) (Zhang, Lee, & Knott, 2014).",

            "text": "In an integrative review, Valim, Marziale, Richart\u2010Mart\u00ednez, and Sanjuan\u2010Quiles (2014) identified 18 measures designed to evaluate levels of compliance and adherence (terms they used interchangeably) with infection control practices. They emphasized that most of those measures assessed adherence/non\u2010adherence rates, and recommended that \u201cfurther research [to] assess the variables that influence adherence to SP\u201d (p. 1516). Attempts to date to determine the reasons for non\u2010adherence to SP among health\u2010care workers have typically used only single items (Lam, 2014; Rabaud et al., 2000; Valim, Marziale, Richart\u2010Mart\u00ednez, & Sanjuan\u2010Quiles, 2014) or observational and anecdotal accounts. These latter accounts indicate that a lack of knowledge, lack of or inadequate supplies, time pressure, confidence in their own skills, the organizational climate, and forgetfulness are among the factors that staff have cited as their reasons for non\u2010adherence (Efstathiou, Papastavrou, Raftopoulos, & Merkouris, 2011b; Hills & Wilkes, 2003; Reda, Fisseha, Mengistie, & Vandeweerd, 2010). Furthermore, Efstathiou et al. (2011b) highlighted that most studies discussing non\u2010adherence to Standard Precautions \u201cstudied only one or limited aspects of SP, mainly hand hygiene\u201d (p. 2). Some attempts to broaden the range of factors argued to assess adherence to SP can be found in the work of Osborne (2003) and Cheung et al. (2015); however, neither study provided detailed items nor any psychometric data beyond Cronbach's alpha. It is important, therefore, to develop and psychometrically validate a scale that systematically assesses a range of factors influencing adherence or non\u2010adherence to SP. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate such a scale. We report on two studies designed to achieve this aim.",

No changes were recommended at this stage. The questions (e.g. I am more likely to wear personal protection equipment if it is located nearby patients, I assess what is wrong with a patient before deciding whether or not to implement SP) were answered on a five point Likert scale, where 0 = not at all and 4 = very much, as per Nunnally's (1967) suggestions on the use of Likert scales.",
