In these conditions, economic, social, and health factors of the country are of utmost concern; therefore, healthcare managers must properly manage and support healthcare centers3 and use supportive measures for the organization and staff to provide the best healthcare services possible. Presenting a scientific framework for managing health centers can be very helpful. The following management-supportive practices are the most important at healthcare centers during outbreaks:1.Engage leadership: Leadership affects the performance of physicians and nurses. Maintain effective communication with employees, pay attention to them, and listen to them effectively.2.Choose wise motivations: Talk about the importance of staff work, appreciate their work, and provide encouragement.3.Note work\u2013life balance: Define a proper and balanced workload for employees. Say that optimal performance depends on enough rest and emphasize the need to re-energize.4.Encourage peer support: Protect your staff from external pressures and from illogical or uncertain demands from patients and individuals, and promote support among colleagues.5.Provide resources to protect employees and their mental health: Minimize risky conditions in the organization and minimize workplace stress to ensure that staff are not exposed to additional stressors.6.Build a good community: Build the right teamwork and improve working relationships.7.Increase employee control over their work: Clarify your expectations of employees and create an environment for team members to perform important tasks without interruption.8.Review your achievements regularly: Talk to staff about progress and successes.9.Cancel unnecessary meetings: Try to avoid unnecessary gatherings at work. Use video conferencing if a meeting needs to be held.\n",
