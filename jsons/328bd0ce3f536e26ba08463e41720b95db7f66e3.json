From a small seed, it grows, flowers, and bears fruit (a pod) only once. The entire growth cycle for most varieties of this plant takes about 120 days. The tiny seeds (like the seeds on a poppy seed roll) germinate quickly in warm air and sufficient soil moisture. In less than 6 weeks, the young plant emerges from the soil, grows a set of four leaves, and resembles a small cabbage in appearance. The lobed, dentate (jagged-edged) leaves are bluish-green with a dull gray or blue tint.",

Morphine (10%-17%), the most important alkaloid, which was discovered by the pharmacist Sert\u00fcrner in a small town of Einbeck, located in Lower Saxonia in Germany in 1803. He decided to name the extract from the opium poppy morphine ( Figure 3. Thebaine (0.5%-2%) a precursor of many of semi-synthetic opioid agonists (i.e. etorphine, oxymorphone) and antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone, diprenorphine, cyprenorphine), mixed agonist/antagonists (nalbuphine) as well as the partial agonist buprenorphine ( Figure C ). 4. Benzylisoquinolines are a group of agents, which do not interact with the opioid receptor. The most important one is papaverine (0.5%-1%) a phosphodiestrase inhibitor, which relaxes the smooth muscle, and noscapine (2%-9%), which is used as a cough suppressant ( Figure D) . Raw or cooked opium contains more than 35 different alkaloids, including morphine, codeine, and thebaine ( Figure II-4) . In Mainland Southeast Asia, the morphine alkaloid alone accounts for approximately 10% of the total weight of opium. Heroin manufacturers must first extract the morphine from the opium, before converting the morphine to heroin. The extraction is a simple process, requiring only a few chemicals and a supply of water. Morphine sometimes is extracted from opium in small clandestine laboratories, which are typically set up near the opium poppy fields. Since the morphine base is about one-tenth the weight and volume of raw opium, it is desirable to reduce the opium to morphine before transporting the product from the field to a heroin laboratory.",

These opium and morphine abuse problems prompted a scientific search for potent, but nonaddictive, painkillers. In the 1870s, chemists developed an opium-based and supposedly nonaddictive substitute for morphine. The Bayer Pharmaceutical Company of Germany was the first to produce the new drug in large quantities under the brand name Heroin. This product was obtained by acetylation of morphine.

Codeine, which is also taken orally, has a strong ability to inhibit coughing, but it induces less analgesia. Among the phenylpiperidines a number of synthetic compounds have entered the market. The most known is meperidine/pethidine (Demerol\u00ae), which is very similar to morphine, but is more efficacious when given orally for the control of pain. Another derivative is loperamide (Imodium\u00ae), an agent being used as a common antidiarrheal, which does not enter the brain, as it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Hence it is not abused and therefore is sold as a DOC (drug over the counter). Contrary, fentanyl (Sublimaze\u00ae) is an opioid, which is at least 200 times as potent as morphine. This agent is used with nitrous oxide or droperidol (a neuroleptic) in intravenous anesthesia (neuroleptanesthesia), but it is also a used in a transdermal patch for the control of chronic pain. Another known opioid is methadone, which has a good oral efficacy, a much longer half-life than morphine (8-12 h) , and in regard to its effect much like morphine. It is used for treatment of heroin addiction and for the control of chronic pain. A methadone congener, which is being used solely in the methadone substitution programs is LAAM ( -levoacetylmethadol), only needs to be taken once every 72 h.

The nomenclature (X-Opioid Peptide receptor) has been proposed giving , mu or MOP; , delta or DOP; , kappa or KOP and ORL1 or NOP receptors. In order to keep matters straightforward the original nomenclature is used in the following chapters. The products of endogenous opioid peptide genes activate opioid receptors physiologically: proenkephalin (giving methionine-and leucine-enkephalin; Metenk and Leu-enk, respectively; Figure II-8), prodynorphin (dynorphins A and B and -neo-endorphin) pro-opiomelanocortin ( -endorphin) and pronociceptin (nociceptin, also known as Orphanin FQ). Met-enk and Leu-enk have highest affinity for -receptors, less affinity for , and very low affinity for -receptors; the dynorphins have preferential affinity for -receptors, but bind to the and types with high affinity; -endorphin binds with high affinity to and receptors, but has little affinity for receptors. All the peptides are full agonists at their cognate receptors. Endomorphin-1 and -2, derived from an unknown precursor, are endogenous peptides with high selectivity for -receptors. These peptides are unusual in that they are partial agonists. None of the proenkephalin, prodynorphin or pro-opiomelanocortin peptide products or the endomorphins displays affinity for the ORL1 receptor.",

Methadone (which also has some NMDA-receptor blocking activity) shows significant binding to -receptors, while buprenorphine, and to a lesser extent naloxone, avidly binds to all three receptor types. There is evidence (albeit inconsistent) that the D-enantiomer of methadone blocks the NMDA receptor [6] . The binding affinity of buprenorphine to the receptor is much greater than that of naloxone, which explains why the latter only partially reverses buprenorphine overdose. Animal data also indicate that codeine and diamorphine have very poor binding to opioid receptors, which reinforces the possibility that both are prodrugs where the pharmacologically active species are morphine [7] and 6-monoacetyl morphine, respectively [8] . Oxycodone may also act through an active metabolite, though there are some data, which suggest that this is not the case [9] . Pethidine is considered to be a potent -receptor agonist, but it does bind weakly to all three opioid receptors (Table II-1) . Ketobemidone has a lower affinity for the -receptor than does morphine, but it shows greater discrimination for this receptor compared to -receptors. The binding of both of these opioids to the -receptor is similar [10] . This difference in opioid action is also mirrored in the difference in affinity of various narcotic ligands interacting with the three relevant opioid receptor sites (Table II-3) . It should be noted that some of those ligands, either pure antagonists, mixed agonist/antagonists or partial agonists, are characterized by displacement potency at a specific receptor site.",

Thus, for these commonly administered opioids, there is no great variability in their affinity for the humanreceptor. The clinical relevance of these data is that different opioids act in different ways. From anecdotal clinical experience there is considerable interindividual Adapted from [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] variability in response to each opioid and this reinforces the need to assess an individual's response to opioid analgesia carefully. It also is premature to extrapolate from laboratory data, which in many instances have not yet been replicated, to the clinic. However, data increasingly inform the clinical use of these drugs and will be particularly relevant to new approaches to their use such as \"opioid switching\". Figure II-10 shows the putative analgesic effect mediated by the main -opioid receptor depicting that higher affinity also correlates closely with analgesic potency. But aside from -receptor interaction, analgesia can also be mediated through a -receptor and a -receptor site. The classification of different opioid receptor types is based on the original description by Martin and coworkers from 1976 [5] . The effects presumed to be mediated at -receptors have been defined as a result of both human and animal studies, while the effects mediated at -receptors derive predominantly from animal models.

Thus, -selective opioids like morphine, fentanyl and sufentanil, due to the high density of binding sites, mediate their main action within the brain stem and the midbrain. Due to their close vicinity to respiratory and cardiovascular regulating centers in the brain stem, selective -opioids accordingly induce a marked depression of respiration and blood pressure. On the other hand, due to the main distribution of the -receptors within the cortex (lamina V, VI) [19] it is conceivable that these ligands induce a lesser respiratory and cardiovascular depressive effect. As a consequence and contrary to -ligands, -ligands induce a marked sedative appearance. In addition, there is a lesser addiction liability with -ligands, which is easily derived from the fact that the relevant areas in the limbic system show a low concentration of -binding sites. Also, the lesser analgesic potency of -ligands is enlightened by the fact that most of the -selective receptors can be found in the deep lamina VI of the cortex. Since their dendrites retrograde descend to the thalamus, all ascending nociceptive input is modified, resulting in a depression of nociceptive afferences and a reduction in arousal. Certain dendrites of petrosal cells of the cortex also descend down to the brain stem, whereby the activating, ascending reticular system (ARS) is affected resulting in a reduction of vigilance [20] .",

This has been one of the reasons, why buprenorphine has not been in cancer pain management. However, the recent development of a transdermal formulation of buprenorphine may encourage its use in chronic cancer pain (and chronic noncancer pain).

Various research groups corroborated this hypothesis almost simultaneously. Pert and Snyder [17] , Terenius [25] and Kosterlitz [26] were the first research group to identify selective binding sites in the CNS using radioactive labeled opioids. These so-called opiate binding sites were found mainly in neuronal structures and nervous pathways involved in the transmission of nociceptive signals such as the first relay station of pain transmission, the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal column. In the posterior horn the impulse is passed over to the second neuron while, simultaneously, descending nerve fibers from the reticular system (the cortico-and reticulo-spinal tract) induce either a facilitation or an attenuation of pain transmission, which results in a modulation of pain impulses at the spinal level ( Figure II-11 ). The course of pain transmission is to the contralateral side of the spinal cord where impulses have already undergone a distinct separation. It is the paleospinothalamic pathway, consisting of nonmyelinated C-fibers, which mediate the excruciating, dull pain component, which is difficult to localize as it ends in the nonspecific nuclei of the medial thalamus [27] . En route, the paleospinothalamic tract sends off afferent fibers to the midbrain area, such as the periaqueductal grey matter and the reticular formation [28] . The pathway ends in intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus and the nucleus limitans, a patch of pigmented nerve cells border the mesencephalon ( Figure II-16) .",

It is worth noting that nervous pathways transmitting the dull, chronic and less pinpointed pain components are more affected by opioids, while , is an important relay station in the mediation of nociceptive afferents to higher pain modulating and discriminating centers of the CNS, which is necessary for the nonspecific feeling of pain and is closely coupled with emotions the neospinothalamic pathway conveys the sharp and well localized pain components which accompany any injury and are always the first to be perceived. The indefinable, dull, emotional component is perceived later, giving pain its negative character. This separation in pain pathways is of special importance. Impulses from the fast pathway usually antagonize the mediation of slow afferent impulses on all levels in the CNS: substantia gelatinosa and reticular formation, as well as the specific and the nonspecific projecting nuclei of the thalamus [30] . Opioid binding sites, as they are visualized with receptor-binding techniques, strikingly map the paleospinothalamic pain pathway ( Figure II-17) . Furthermore, there is a high density of opioid binding sites in various other parts of the brain [3, 17, 18, 31]: 1. The corpus striatum, being part of the limbic and the extrapyramidal motor system, is responsible for triggering opioid-induced muscular rigidity. It is not only the regulatory center for locomotion but it is also the center for the regulation of attention and perception. 4. The nucleus solitary tract in the brain stern, which is the origin of the noradrenergic dorsal pathway bundle, which is in command of vigilance and the cough reflex. 5. The nuleus amygdala, being part of the limbic system, is in charge of the mediation of euphoria (or \"kick\") when opioids are used for other purposes than pain. 6. The locus coeruleus being the origin of the neurosympathetic system in the brain stem, regulates peripheral vasodilatation. 7. Lastly, a dense accumulation of opioid binding sites is found in the substantia gelatinosa at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. -Current thinking is that effective opioid analgesics work through stimulating mu ( ) receptors, which also produce euphoria. -Euphoria is mediated by the actions of opiates at a cluster of brain areas that include the nucleus accumbens and ventral segmental area. Dopamine influx seems to cause subjective pleasure, or euphoria. -Opioids may have a \"disinhibiting\" (inhibition of inhibitory neurons) effect that allows greater dopamine influx. Because the main property of opioids is the blockade of nociceptive transmission in the mesencephalon (i.e. the nucleus limitans and the limbic system) the following effects can be observed: 1. No pain (analgesia), since any sensation is not identified as painful. 2. A lack of the negative emotional component of pain. On the contrary, euphoria may result and pain is no longer experienced as an emotional distress, even though pain impulses are transmitted via the ventrocaudal-parvocellular nucleus to the postcentral cortex. 3. During the opioid-induced pain-free state, the site of pain, however, still can be localized. As a consequence pain has lost its negative character and is no longer experienced or perceived as uncomfortable and distressing.",

            "text": "In contrast to the analgesics that have a peripheral site of action (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid; ASA), opioids act at the relay station of nociceptive-propagating pathways at the synapse of nerve conduction. Within the nerve, pain impulses are transmitted as a change in electric conduction. And in order to guarantee maintenance of the nociceptive impulse, the excitatory impulse releases a neurotransmitter at the terminal nerve. Due to its chemical configuration, the transmitter fits exactly into a binding site at the opposite nerve ending resulting in an increase of excitability and a change in the electrical nerve conduction. Opioids have the property of binding to specific receptor sites at pre-and post terminal nerve endings resulting in an inhibition of a release of the excitatory neurotransmitter. The continuity of the impulse is interrupted, the nociceptive signal is no longer transmitted and thus can no longer be perceived as such ( Figure II-11 ). Due to the difference in stereoconfiguration, opioids differ in their affinity (i.e. goodness of fit) at these binding sites ( Figure II-18 ). This explains why different opioids are characterized by a large variety in potency. In addition, opioids also differ in their intrinsic activity (i.e. the degree of conformational change of the receptor site) resulting in different intracellular effects. Taken together affinity and intrinsic activity results in the efficacy of a drug within the system ( Figure II-19) .",

            "text": "Contrary to agonists, antagonists are able to displace an opioid from its receptor binding site and take up his position. Displacement is only possible because the antagonist has a greater affinity to the binding site. Therefore, affinity of an opioid antagonist is expressed in its antagonistic potency. Naloxone or naltrexone have a very high affinity to the receptor and easily displace an opioid whereas levallorphan is five times weaker ( Figure II-21) . In order to induce a similar antagonistic effect, a higher dose of levallorphan is necessary. In order to induce increasing effects with opioids, the goodness of fit not only is a prerequisite. Of additional importance is the conformational change the receptor undergoes after binding, which is expressed in the \"the intrinsic activity\". An opioid must, therefore, not only fit to the receptor; it must also induce a chain reaction in the transmembrane receptor domain resulting in a net effect ( Figure II-19) . The reaction after opioid binding seems to depend on the side chain of the molecule. Thus it appears that one portion of the opioid molecule provides the binding to the receptor whereas another portion is responsible for the induction of a conformational change (i.e. intrinsic activity), which will either be of agonistic or antagonistic nature. In a sensitive and specific opiate-receptor assay, the guinea pig ileum with its dense accumulation of receptor binding sites, it was possible to demonstrate receptor affinity and pharmacological efficacy ( Figure II-22) . This assumption is underlined by the effects induced by \"pure\" opioid antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, which also have a good fit with the receptor site, however when given on their own do not induce an analgesic effect. For instance, if naloxone is given by itself, the compound does not induce effects similar to its parent compound oxymorphone ( Figure II-14) . Also, in contrast to a potent opioid like fentanyl, the antagonist naloxone has a lower dissociation coefficient resulting in a shorter duration of action, which may result in a reoccurrence of an opioid-like effects such as respiratory depression. However, due to its high Source: Adapted from [33, 34, 35] Part II Figure II-20. Difference in affinity and intrinsic activity of various opioids. Note, that codeine has a similar intrinsic activity as sufentanil. However, due to the higher affinity of the latter the net analgesic potency is much larger association coefficient (i.e. affinity), it induces a rapid displacement of the agonist and a reversal of all opioid effects. On the other hand mixed agonist/antagonists, such as pentazocine, nalorphine, levallorphan, nalbuphine and butorphanol, demonstrate characteristics, which enable them to displace a pure agonist at the receptor site (antagonistic effect), but at the same time when administered by themselves, they induce opioid related effects such as analgesia and respiratory depression (agonistic effects; Table II-7) . Such dual activity is only possible by means of their intrinsic activity at two distinct and different receptor sites: one the antagonistic activity at the -and its agonistic action art the -receptor site. And lastly, partial agonists like meptazinol and buprenorphine induce their analgesic potency via the -opioid receptor. Although having a high affinity, their analgesic ceiling effect at the higher dose range is due to a lesser intrinsic activity, resulting in a lesser net analgesic appearance than pure agonists. Such difference in the characteristic traits of opioids can be summarized as follows: 1. The affinity to the receptor (displacement properties or extrinsic activity) 2. The intensity of binding to the receptor (duration of effect) 3. The ability to change the conformation of the receptor (intrinsic activity) 4. The competitive potency (antagonism) 5. The degree of metabolism (duration of effect) Note the relatively high antagonistic potency of buprenorphine, however, is due to its high affinity to the receptor site resulting in the displacement of a ligand at the preoccupied receptor site.

While the subunit is different for each G-protein, the \u00df/ pair can be the same. However, all of the G-proteins share a similar structure.

Other effectors that are G-proteindependent include additional enzymes, like cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, and transmembrane ion channels ( Figure II In its resting conformation, the G-protein consists of a complex of the three subunit chains and a GDP molecule bound to the alpha subunit. The alpha subunit is in close proximity to the intracellular part of the transmembrane receptor and, when a ligand binds to the receptor, the change in its conformation causes it to bind to the G-protein at the alpha subunit. This results in an exchange of bound GDP for GTP, which is more abundant in the cell than GDP. GTP causes a conformational change in the alpha subunit, thus \"activating\" it so that the alpha subunit dissociates from the -pair.

Rather, it has been determined that ligand induced dimerization is the mechanism through which the receptor PTKs are activated. This dimerization brings the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain on each receptor into close enough arrangement so that each kinase can phosphorylate Tyr residues in the other's tyrosine kinase domain.

One of the major consequences following opioid administration is that of analgesia, or antinociception. And while NSAIDs induce their antiniociceptive effect via cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition, local anesthetics selectively block ion-channels, thus inhibiting the transmission of nociceptive efferent to the higher pain modulating centers in the CNS. Contrary, opioids bind to those areas, which not only are involved in transduction but also in the modulation and identification of painful afferences. Although the majority of opioids are able to induce a maximal analgesic effect, the dosages necessary to induce such a result differ significantly. For instance, an opioid like sufentanil Part II needs a much lower dosage than the less potent opioid morphine. This is due to the higher affinity and intrinsic activity of sufentanil, suggesting that only a lesser portion of receptors needs to be occupied in order to induce the desired effect. However, a high analgesic potency necessarily does not reflect a better efficacy. This is because in certain painful conditions, some opioids are more efficacious than others. On the other hand, not all painful conditions, as the patient expresses them, can be treated successfully with an opioid. Therefore, before starting an opioid therapy it is mandatory to evaluate the kind of painful condition the patient has, use the specific opioids as indicated, and avoid those painful states where opioids are contraindicated or result in a lesser therapeutic effect. However, there is the general position:",

Trigger points are typical points which are sore and from which the pain radiates to referred areas. Such points can be felt as knots or bumps under the palpating finger, which can be moved over the underlying musculature. Following the in injection of the local anesthetic the circulus vituosus of increased muscle tension and myofacial pain is interrupted. Local ischemia is alleviated and local accumulation of pain mediating substances is flushed out. A typical example is tension-type headache, which is the moist common type of headache. Originating from increased stress, it is accompanied by emotional factors and fear. Thus the painful condition can be considered of psychosomatic nature. -Pain of neurogenic or deafferentiation origin, also termed as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), this type of pain is mostly seen after injury of peripheral nerves leading to spontaneous and paroxysmal discharges.

Partial denervation with spontaneous discharge of nerve activity is followed by an induced release of a nerve growth factor (NGF). Such release induces sprouting of fibers into adjacent afferent somatic nerve fibers resulting in an enlargement of the receptive field and an increased conduction of nociceptive impulses to higher pain centers ( Figure II-30 Other topical formulations with capscaicin or EMLA cream present additional therapeutic options for treatment of neuropathic pain. In addition, transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) or even spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may present an alternative and effective strategy, resulting in the attenuation of pain.

Such a painful condition is mainly seen in the depressive patient or it may even be a premonitoring sign of schizophrenia.

The rational for the therapy with a central analgesic is related to the fact, that the nociceptive impulses are transmitted via specific pain afferents reaching supraspinal areas.

The total apnea, where in spite of any external stimuli or the command to breathe the patient spontaneously will not be able to take a deep breath. He needs immediate respiratory assistance. This centrally-induced opioid-related respiratory depression is due to a blockade of the respiratory regulating centers within the brain stem (pons and medulla), resulting in a lesser sensitivity to an increase in arterial pCO 2 and/or a reduction of arterial pO 2 [39, 40] . In addition the activating reticular system (ARS), which descends down into the brain stem, acts as a regulatory pacemaker for the inspiratory center, by which respiratory depressive effect of opioids are affected.

Such difference has also been demonstrated for fentanyl-analogues in the animal [54] , suggesting a clinical relevance for reversal of respiratory impairment, however at the same time maintaining antinociception. Such connotation was further corroborated by experimental data where the selective antagonist naloxonazine was able to reverse opioid induced analgesia, but not respiratory impairment. This led to the assumption that -opioid subreceptors are involved in the mediation of opioid-induced respiratory depression (i.e. 1 and 2 ) [55, 56] . Clinical data seem to underline this assumption, as low doses of sufentanil demonstrated a lesser respiratory depressive effect and a higher analgesic potency when compared to fentanyl. Such difference in action reportedly is due to a disparity in receptor affinity to -subsites, with a higher affinity to the 1 -and a lesser affinity to the 2 -receptor [57] .",

            "text": "Besides a direct action of opioids on the sensitivity of the respiratory center to changes of arterial pO 2 and pCO 2 , also centrally-induced sedative effects very likely influence respiration. Such sedative effects can be derived with the aid of the electroencephalogram where clinically different potent opioids qualitatively induce a different in the EEG pattern. Since such EEG changes are dose-related, one is able to derive a dose-relationship. At the same time such EEG-changes reflect the bioavailability of centrally active agents acting on nervous structures of the CNS, depicting the effect-concentration site [62, 63] . Thus, following intravenous administration of an agent, it is not the plasma concentration, which is responsible for a centrally induced effect. More importantly, it is the actual concentration of the opioid at the receptor site, which is affected significantly by issues such as distribution of an agent, its lipophilicity, or the present brain perfusion. Therefore vigilance changes can be considered as important aspects in an opioidrelated respiratory impairment being derived in two relevant experiments: 1. Wakefulness by itself already is a fact resulting in sufficient respiration. This could be demonstrated nicely in volunteers where hyperventilation and the resultant hypocapnia resulted in a rhythmic respiratory pattern. If however, the same volunteers were asleep or in anesthesia, hypocapnia was followed by apnea [64] . 2. In the animal laryngeal stimulation during anesthesia resulted in apnae, without, however, initiating a cough reflex. Being awake, a cough reflex without apnae was induced following laryngeal stimulation [65] . 3. There is a close exponential correlation of the physiologic regulatory mechanism affecting respiration. This had been demonstrated after sufentanil application in the canine, whereby increasing dosages of a selective antagonist not only Dose-related reversal of sufentanil-induced hypercarbia and hypoxia with the two selective -antagonists naltrindol (NTI) and naltribene (NTB) respectively, in the canine. Due to the higher lipophilicity of naltribene being able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, there is a superior reversal effect. In spite of increasing doses of the antagonist there is a blockade of response to the electrically induced evoked potential, which is only reversed by the highly specific -antagonist cyprodime. Adapted from [60] reversed the depressed respiratory drive but at the same time induced an increase of power in the high frequency beta band (13-30 Hz) of the EEG ( Figure II-39) , reflecting increase in vigilance [66] . 4. Clinically such sedative related respiratory depression can also be derived in patients, when cumulative dosages of an opioid reach a point where the respiratory center \"forgets\" to respond adequately by initiating deep breaths (oublie respiratoire). This is seen in classical neuroleptanalgsia where the patient's vigilance can be increased to a point by external stimuli (e.g. pain, auditory stimuli) resulting in the initiation of an inspiratory effort [67] . From all these data it can be derived that the simultaneous binding of opioid within the activating reticular system (ARS) in the brain stem, vigilance is depressed, which secondarily affects the response of the respiratory center following hypercapnia. At such instances the overall mesencephalic reticular control mechanism is no longer able to adequately respond to a stimulus and only with an increase in vigilance there is an accelerated reactivity, being able to sufficiently respond to an increase in arterial pCO2. Since the reticular mechanism is coupled with reticulo-cortical afferences, such changes can be derived from cortical changes in the EEG. Such a \"forgotten\" reaction to sufficiently respond to a given stimulus [65] is also seen in the clinical environment when a benzodiazepine is given on-top of an opioid resulting in a further deterioration of respiratory drive. This is because a benzodiazepine depresses the reaction of the ARS, and the concomittant reduction in vigilance results in a lessened reaction to external stimuli, producing a clinically relevant suppression of respiration.

The uncritical intraoperative use of high concentrations of a volatile anesthetic, which results in a lesser biodegradation of the opioid. 4. The intraoperative administration of fractional doses of an opioid, which results in an accumulation. Due to the fact that a portion of each dose of an intravenously administered opioid is also taken up by peripheral sites (e.g. fatty tissue, musculature, skin, internal organs) there is an accumulation of the agent, which act like a depot. From there the drug later diffuses into the blood-stream, resulting in a prolongation of effects ( Figure II-40 ). 5. An insufficient loading dose of the opioid, which may result in the necessity of re-administration of small amounts of the drug intraoperatively with consequent peripheral accumulation. 6.

Such an effect is mostly seen with the mixed agonist/antagonists, while morphine takes a medium position ( Figure II-41) . The hypno-sedative effect of opioids is useful in premedication and during postoperative analgesia, where a sedated status of the patient is advantageous. In contrast to a potent sedative nature of mixed agonist/antagonists, the pure -type ligand fentanyl is characterized by a very low sedative potency. When in the beginning of use of neuroleptic analgesia for anesthesia, fentanyl was used together with the neuroleptic agent droperidol, often patients reported of intraoperative \"awareness\". Although being an obligatory part of anesthesia, sleep, was not sufficiently maintained throughout the whole procedure. Therefore in order to guarantee a sufficient level of sleep in patients receiving a fentanyl-based anesthetic technique, an additional hypnotic (propofol), a benzodiazepine (midazolam), a neuroleptic agent (i.e. dehydrobenzperidol), or a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane, desflurane, or enflurane) has to be given on-top the opioid. Nowadays the problem of awareness again has gained much attention [78] , since the technique of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with remifentanil and [84] propofol, completely omitting nitrous oxide (N 2 O), often results in an insufficient level of sleep with awareness.",

Therefore such agents cannot be regarded as suitable for intraoperative use, where an intense nociceptive barrage can only be blocked by a potent -opioid.

For instance, such effects clinically are seen when high-dose opioid anesthesia is used in cardiac patients for the induction of anesthesia. Such a sleepinducing effect is due to a short-term blockade of all afferences being switched in the activating reticular system (ARS) of the mesencephalon.

This is because the opioid is redistributed, which results in a lesser concentration within the CNS and a lesser binding in areas within the ARS. At this stage there is a Note, a pronounced delta activation after injection and a lesser arousal reaction induced by laryngoscopy and intubation, which in the sufentanil group reflected in a lesser decline of power in the slow delta-domain of the EEG. Adapted from [92] dominance in the -band (7-13 Hz) of the EEG, which is stable, not being affected by any nociceptive stimuli [93, 94] . Clinically, such an effect has been described for the precursor of fentanyl, the opioid phenoperidine [95] and for fentanyl [96] . After a period of 10-15 min the deep narcotic component changes into a sedative state, which is stable and cannot be reversed to desynchronization by any nociceptive stimulus. During such \"analgesic state\" the patient again is able to respond to verbal commands, while at the same time having a deep analgesic level ( Figure II-44) . Without the addition of nitrous oxide, such patients are awake, however, nociceptive afferents are not able to modulate the ARS, the endotracheal tube is tolerated while at the same time nociception is only sensed as a touch. Such phenomena are due to afferents ascending along the spinothalamic tract, which directly ascend to the postcentral cortical area by which the impulse can be localized. Collaterals, which ascend through the nucleus limitans within the limbic system and convey nociception, are sufficiently blocked by the opioid and the patient does not perceive pain ( Figure II-45) . The opioid receptor system bordering the fourth cerebral ventricle and the underlying activating reticular system is the relevant anatomical structure in mediating sedation. Selective perfusion of increasing concentrations of the opioid fentanyl in the awake canine induced a dose-related enlargement of slow-wave high amplitude delta-activity within the EEG, characterized by a sleep-like behavior ( Figure II-46) . This effect was reversed by the levo-isomer of naloxone inducing an arousal reaction. It, however, was not reversible by the dextro-isomer of the antagonist [98] . The physiological significance of opioid receptors in the control of vigilance is also reflected in the high density of opioid binding sites in the mesencephalon [99] . Physiologically this is mirrored by an arousal reaction following intense acoustic or a nociceptive stimulus, both of which induce a reversal from the low frequency delta-to high frequency beta-activity in the EEG ( Figure II-47) .",

Since these nuclei reflect a specific somatotopic differentiation, electrical stimulation within this area induced painful sensations in different parts of the body.

            "text": "Following the administration of high dosages of opioids with different potency, epileptogenic activities in the EEG with tonic-clonic seizures can be induced in the animal. Pethidine (meperidine), morphine, alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil when administered in doses above 20, 180, 5, 4 and 4 mg/kg body weight respectively, induced epileptogenic discharges [103] . Because such massive dosages are never used in anesthesia or for analgesia in acute or chronic pain, epileptogenic effects, although being cited in the literature after fentanyl [104, 105] and sufentanil [106] are of insignificant nature. This is because the clinical picture resembles tonicclonic seizures, however, in the EEG no such discharges could be derived [107] . Therefore, those high doses of opioids, which induced epileptogenic activity in the rat [108] or the canine [103] are far off from therapeutic range. Thus, in general, an epileptogenic activity of opioids can be canceled out. One exception is the use of high dosages of pethidine (meperidine), where the metabolic product norpethidine is a potent epileptogenic compound, which especially in the newborn is able to induce epileptogenic activity [109] . The cause for the few observations of a pseudoepileptogenic activity of opioids when being administered within the therapeutic range very likely is due to a desinhibition of the cortical motor center within the CNS, as this phenomenon was observed during the induction of anesthesia or following a decline in plasma concentration. Such assumption is underlined by Part II Figure II-48 . Two main components of painful afferents: localization of nociception (cortical area) and the initiation of the negative component (i.e. the limbic system within the mesencephalon). Opioids mainly modify the latter area \"epileptogenic activity\" during the induction of anesthesia with the pure hypnotic etomidate, where desinhibition of the motor cortex activity was the cause of cortical discharges [110] .",

Although myelinated, rapidly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (RARs), also known as irritant receptors, are the most likely type of sensory nerve that stimulates the cough center in the brain, afferent C-fibers and slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (SARs) also may modulate cough. RARS, C-fibers, and SARs have been identified in the distal esophageal mucosa; however, studies have not been performed to determine whether they can participate in the cough reflex. Although gastroesophageal reflux disease can potentially stimulate the afferent limb of the cough reflex by irritating the upper respiratory tract without aspiration and by irritating the lower respiratory tract by micro-or macroaspiration, there is evidence that strongly suggests that reflux commonly provokes cough by stimulating an esophageal-bronchial reflex. Each involuntary cough involves a complex reflex arch beginning with the stimulation of sensory nerves in the airway epithelium that function as \"cough receptors.\" Efferent impulses from these receptors are conducted by means of the vagus nerve to the \"cough center\" in the brain stem. Because cough can be voluntarily suppressed, controlled, or initiated, there also can be afferent input from the cerebral cortex. The function of this \"cough center\" is to receive these impulses and produce a cough by activating efferent nervous pathways to the diaphragm and laryngeal, thoracic, and abdominal musculature. The possibility that there might be afferent input other than the vagus nerve and cerebral cortex was based on clinical observations described in case reports and a few animal studies [111] .",

It shows the myelinated, rapidly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (RARs), also referred to as irritant receptors, as the most likely type of sensory nerve that stimulates the cough center in the brain. Both mechanical and chemical stimulation of RARs have been shown experimentally to cause cough. Another type of sensory nerve in the airways, C-fibers, may also participate in regulating cough. They are unmyelinated, vagal afferent fibers that may be activated by the same triggers as RARs. Their activation releases neuropeptides locally that may secondarily stimulate cough by activating RAR nerves. However; impulses transmitted by C-fibers alone probably do not stimulate cough, because experimental evidence has shown that they inhibit cough centrally in the brain. A third type of sensory nerve, the slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (SARs), may modulate cough. Although these nerves do not directly respond to chemical and mechanical triggers, they do appear to be activated by the deep breath of a cough and may enhance cough by making the expiratory effort more forceful.

Based on the fact that cough can be voluntarily initiated, postponed, and/or suppressed, this provides evidence that there also can be afferent input from the cerebral cortex.

Also, it is directly proportional to the analgesic potency and it depends on the opioid receptor sites with which the ligand interacts. For instance, members of mixed agonist/antagonists (i.e. nalbuphine, pentazocine, butorphanbol) demonstrate a predominant interaction with the -opioid receptor, which is characterized by a low dependence liability ( Figure II-51 ). In addition, development of dependence also is related to the speed For instance, an opioid like buprenorphine is characterized by a low dissociation constant reflecting long binding to the receptor, a long duration of action and a slow separation from the receptor. The definition of addiction is based in two different terms: 1. Physiological dependence produced by repeated drug-taking that is characterized by a withdrawal syndrome, when drug is removed (e.g. alcohol, opiates). 2. Psychological dependence produced by repeated drug taking that is characterized by obsessions and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors; results in a detrimental impairment in physical, mental or social functioning. There are five classes of abused psychoactive drugs 1. Opioids produce a dream-like state; effects include: analgesic (reduction in pain), hypnotic (sleep inducing), euphoria (sense of happiness or ecstasy) using morphine, heroin, or the cough suppressant codeine. 2. Depressants produce feelings of relaxation/sedation and a dream-like state, anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) and hypnotic effects; reduce central nervous system activity. Members of the class are alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. 3. Stimulants increase alertness, arousal, and elevated mood; activate central nervous system (sympathomimetic = mimic the activation of the sympathetic nervous system). Members of this class are cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine, caffeine. 4. Psychedelics produce distortions of perception and an altered sense of reality.",

These are caused by repeated injections into adjacent sites over an accessible vein. Tracks are often found in easily accessible body areas, such as the backs of the hands, antecubital fossae, on the legs, or in the neck. Signs of recent injection may be found in unusual places in patients attempting to hide their sites of injection. A thorough examination for tracks or recent injection sites should include looking between the Table II-10. Factors that influence how quickly a drug will enter the brain 1. Chemical structure: How fatty is the drug (i.e. its lipophilicity)? Does the drug have nutrients that our brain uses? 2. How fast does the drug cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) Lipophilic drugs (i.e. heroin, fentanyl) cross the BBB much faster than hydrophilic agents (i.e., morphine); they mimic nutrients our brain needs and can \"slip\" through transporters in the BBB. 3. Route of administration: Is the drug entering directly into the blood stream or is it entering first into the stomach? The routes of administration increase the likelihood that a drug enters the blood stream whereby it increases the addictive liability of the drug.

The nervous pathways involved in the development of dependence is the mesolimbic-dopaminergic reward system, where direct activation (i.e. cocaine, nicotine, alcohol) or inhibition of the inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) directly project to dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens (i.e. opioids such as heroin) results in an increased release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and stimulation of the prefrontal area resulting in euphoria.

About 20% of all patients experience nausea and/or emesis after opioid anesthesia.

This area is richly supplied with dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5-HT 3 ), and cholinergic receptor sites, being the origin of metabolic or drug induced vomiting [113] . Contrary to the other areas within the CNS, the CTZ is characterized by leaking capillaries (windowed capillaries), through which opioids as well as toxins can disseminate. Such anatomical difference indicates that this area does not contain the usual blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Use of this agent is controversial because of its alleged association with delayed wound healing. It has a slow onset but a prolonged duration of action, and therefore it is advised that dexamethasone be administered upon induction of anesthesia. The most commonly used dose for adults is 8-10 mg i.v. Smaller doses of 2.5-5 mg have also been used and found to be as effective. Based on a quantitative, systematic review of the data, no adverse side effects, especially delayed wound healing, have been noted following a single antiemetic dose of dexamethasone [119] .",

Similar to haloperidol it acts as a dopamine antgonist at the CTZ and the area postrema. For greatest efficacy, droperidol is administered at the end of surgery or concomitantly with morphine via patient-controlled analgesia systems. The use of low doses (0.625-1.25 mg) of droperidol has not been associated with the typical side effects of higher doses of this drug (hypotension, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, akathisia, dysphoria). In 2001, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring that droperidol labeling include a \"black box\" warning stating that the drug may cause death or life-threatening events resulting from QTc prolongation and the possibility of life-threatening torsades de pointes. The labeling requirement was based on 10 reported cases associated with droperidol use (at doses of 1.25 mg) during its approximately 30 years on the market [120] . However, no case reports in peer-reviewed journals have linked droperidol with QTc prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, or death at the doses used for the management of PONV. Also, in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo controlled trial, droperidol was not associated with a significant increase in the QTc interval in comparison with saline solution [121] . In another recent study, droperidol did not increase the QTc interval any more than did ondansetron [122] .",

After medication and mechanical causes of PONV have been excluded, rescue therapy with antiemetics can be initiated. For patients who received no prophylaxis, low-dose therapy with 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonists may be initiated. Consensus guidelines also recommend low-dose therapy with a 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist for patients in whom dexamethasone prophylaxis has failed. For patients in whom initial 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist prophylaxis has failed, a 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist rescue therapy should not be given within the first 6 h after surgery. Similarly, patients in whom prophylactic combination therapy with a 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist plus dexamethasone has failed should be treated with an antiemetic from a different class. As a general guideline, patients who experience PONV within 6 h after surgery should be treated with an antiemetic other than the one used for prophylaxis. For the treatment of patients who experience PONV > 6 h after surgery, drugs from the prophylactic antiemetic regimen may be repeated, except for dexamethasone and transdermal scopolamine, which have a longer duration of action. Also, propofol may be used in small doses (20 mg as needed) for the treatment of PONV in a supervised environment. The preliminary results of a recent analysis support the recommendation that a rescue antiemetic should be from a class other than that of the original antiemetic agent [123] . This analysis of a previous trial reported that in patients who failed prophylaxis with ondansetron or droperidol, promethazine was significantly more effective in controlling PONV than the original agent. Dimenhydrinate was also more effective than droperidol in patients who failed prophylaxis with droperidol. In summary, the first step in the management of PONV is to identify surgical patients at high or moderate risk for PONV, then reduce baseline risk factors in these patients. Combination antiemetic therapy is recommended for patients at high risk for PONV for patients at moderate risk, monotherapy or combination therapy may be considered. A multi modal approach for the prevention of PONV including the use of antimetics with different mode of action, hydration and TIVA with propofol has been shown to be most effective. Patients who have not received prophylaxis and experience PONV can be treated with a low dose of a 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonist. In patients who fail prophylaxis treatment with an antiemetic, another agent than the one used for prophylaxis is recommended.",

The anatomical correlate by which opioids induce muscular rigidity is the striatum, and, being part of the basal ganglion system, it has the task to control locomotion ( Figure II-58) . Within the striatum there is a dense accumulation of opioid binding sites, which interact with dopaminergic D 2 -receptors. Similar as in Parkinson's disease, there is a reduction in the dopamine level with an ensuing imbalance of the cholinergic transmitter system, both of which are in balance with each other and a necessary prerequisite for the control of muscle tone [129] . While in Parkinson's disease, increased muscle tone is induced by decrease of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, opioid-induced rigidity is due to an enhanced degradation of the transmitter dopamine resulting in a functional deficit of a sufficient level in the nigro-striatal pathway [130] . The exact mode of action of opioids to reduce dopamine level within the nigrostriatal system and induce muscular rigidity, very likely is induced by inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase, the necessary enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine [131] . Due to the interconnection with the inhibitory gabaminergic system, output of GABA in the pallidum declines ( Figure II-58) . This, in turn, causes an overactivity of cholinergic neurons projecting to thalamic neurons. From here the area 6a of the cortical premotor center is activated and the corticospinal tract leads efferents to the anterior horn of the spinal cord [132] . Although opioids do not directly affect muscle tone, rigidity rapidly can be reversed by the injection of a competitive or non-competitive muscle relaxant [133] . Although the increased efferent output at the neuromuscular junction is not reduced, muscle relaxants induce their action by inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine at the motor endplate ( Figure II-59) .",

It is generally accepted, however, that sympathetic innervation is not essential, the miotic effect being entirely dependent on the integrity of the parasympathetic system. For example, Lee and Wang [182] have shown that dogs with a sectioned oculomotor nerve fail to show miosis even with a 30 fold increase in the dose of morphine. In contrast, dogs show normal responses following sympathectomy. While local application of a muscarinic antagonist (scopolamine) that blocks the pupil sphincter completely abolishes the pupillary effects of morphine in the rabbit, application of a sympathetic neuronal blocker (guanethidine) or of an alpha-adrenergic antagonist (phentolamine) that block the pupil dilator had no effect in those experiments. Thus, pharmacologic dissection of the autonomic innervation of the pupil suggests that opioid-induced miosis is mediated solely through the parasympathetic system.",

The latter are known to play a regulatory role in pupillary function, particularly with respect to the near-response (accommodation, convergence and miosis) and, hence, their removal might be expected to alter the pupillary response to drugs. The same authors also observed that acute or chronic optic nerve section did not alter the miotic response to morphine in dogs.",

Taken together, these findings suggest that morphine may cause miosis through more than one mechanism. The main neural structures, which are thought to regulate pupillary size are found in the midbrain, mainly the pretectal area and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus of the oculomotor complex. Because neuronal unit activity in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus has been shown to correlate with light-induced pupillary constriction. Opioids therefore depress or abolish spontaneous and light-induced firing of pupilloconstrictor neurons in the pretectal area, while the opposite effect is observed in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus where a marked increase in spontaneous firing rate resulting in madriasis. It is because of this increase in activity that certain animal species (rat, cat, monkey) demonstrate an opioid-induced mydriasis.",

These findings suggest that opioids may act directly on the neurons subserving the parasympathetic light reflex. Also, in contrast to other workers, morphine has no local action on the iris. For example, Lee and Wang [182] could not produce miosis by injecting 20% of an effective systemic dose of morphine (1 mg) directly into the anterior chamber of the eye in dogs. Although opioid binding sites have been found in the retina of the rat, cow, toad and skate, opioids injected into the anterior chamber may stimulate retinal receptors in some species, causing miosis via reflex parasympathetic output.",

The physiological significance of peripherally located opioid binding sites within the intestine is that of regulation of the propulsive transit. The intestine with a total surface of nearly 400 m 2 is an underestimated important anatomical site as it has a high accumulation of neuronal tissue, which has been termed the enteral nervous system (ENS), which acts like a second brain. Since there is a close interconnection of the ENS with the CNS via the vagus nerve, regular impulses to and from the ENS are being exchanged. Anatomically the intestine is surrounded by two separate syncytial, netlike nervous structures. One is the myentericus plexus (Auerbach) located between the longitudinal and the circulatory muscle fibers ( Figure II-60) . The second is the submucosal Meissner plexus, located between circulatory and the submucosal muscle fibers. Within the Auerbach plexus of the intestinal tract, there is a balance between the cholinergic and enkephalinergic neurons: Binding of systemically applied opioids to enkaphalinergic receptor sites results in an inhibition of transit followed by constipation. Contrarily, cholinesterase inhibitors induce an accumulation of acetylcholine at ACh-receptors with an increase in motility and an enhancement of transit. Presently, however, not very much is known of the long-term effect of central analgesics on opioid-receptors within the myenteric plexus, and if opioid ligands induce only a constipating effect, whether they also depress the immune system in the intestine or result in a distress the neuroregulatory and endocrine function.",

This is most relevant in patients with chronic pain taking an opioid for its attenuation. Being one of the major side effects, it often results in the necessity to take a laxative on a routine basis. The cause for such constipation is the constriction of the pylorus resulting in a delay in emptying of the stomach [137] . However, most important, opioids induce a constriction of the small intestine resulting in a delay of the propulsive transit. Because selective opioid binding sites are mainly located in the small intestine, opioids inhibit the release of local acetylcholine [136, 137, 138] , followed by a concomitant loss of coordinated propulsive movements of the gut. A constipating effect of opioids on the large intestine is of significantly lesser degree, because this part of the intestinal tract contributes to a much lesser extent to the overall constipating effect. This is because continuous propulsive movements are not seen on this area, and contrary to the small intestine, the percentage of enkephalinergic neurons is significantly lower [139, 140] . In addition, enkephalin derivatives are able to inhibit transit in the small while at the same time increasing contractions in the large intestine [141] . Systemicallyselective applied opioids therefore primarily interact with enkephalinergic neurons in the antrum, the duodenum, and the small intestine, all of which results in a delay of transit [142, 143, 144, 145] . The constipating effect of an opioid can be reversed by a selective peripheral acting antagonists such as methylnaltrexone [146, 147] or alvimopane [148] .",

Both fentanyl derivates are not in clinical use, because the high potency and the intense receptor binding would be difficult to handle in patients. From the table, however, it is obvious that the higher the selectivity to the receptor site, and the higher the potency, the lesser the amount of cardiovascular depression [33, 35, 103, 155, 156, 157] . Following the injection of potent opioids, bradycardia is the most prominent cardiovascular effect seen in patients. This is due to a direct central stimulation of the nucleus nervi vagi and a typical effect of -ligands. Thereafter, a reduction of the sympathetic drive is initiated resulting in an overexpression of parasympathetic activity. Also, a direct peripheral negative inotropic activity with a potentiation of acetylcholine release at the sinus node of the heart is discussed [158] . The increase in vagal tone and the reduction of sympathetic drive on the peripheral vasculature results in a decline of mean arterial pressure. A reduction of sympathetic tone on vessel tone and a reduction of resistance is also termed as \"pooling\" of circulating blood volume. Such a reduction of peripheral resistance in certain cases may be of benefit for the patient, as it is accompanied by a reduction in afterload of the heart [159, 160] . Bradycardia, the reduced peripheral resistance (i.e. afterload of heart) as well as the pooling effect with a reduction of preload of the heart, can be of benefit for a patient with myocardial infarction. This is because those three variables are major determinants in myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO 2 ) [160, 161] . It, however, should be noted that the sympatholytic action with pooling of blood volume induced by potent opioids might demask a previously compensated hypovolemic condition in a patient resulting in significant hypotension. For instance, in patients with multiple trauma a reduced dose of the opioid should be given, either diluted or slowly injected while measuring blood pressure continuously. In general, however, especially in polytraumatized patients, opioids are of benefit, as they reduce the stress-related release of hormones and particularly of angiotensin II, maintaining the effect of circulating catecholamines on the vasculature.",

Thus, at the cellular level these changes may underlie the opioid stimulatory effect. In addition, such stimulation is also discussed as playing a part in the development of tolerance to opioid drugs [164] . The effect of increasing doses (mg/kg body weight) of potent opioids on the cardiovascular system of the canine, where low amounts result in parasympathetic activation, and high to massive doses induce an increase of sympathetic drive. Adapted from [103] In opioid-based anesthesia, vagal-or sympathetic-induced side effects can be reduced or eliminated by the following techniques: 1. The preliminary administration of atropine (up to 1 mg/kg body weight). 2. The simultaneous administration of a volatile anesthetic (N 2 O, enflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane). 3. The simultaneous use of a neuroleptic agent (e.g. droperidol, haloperidol). 4. The simultaneous use of a benzodiazepine (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, lorazepam). 5. The simultaneous use of a hypnotic (e.g. barbiturate, etomidate, propofol). Adapted from [103, 162] All these agents induce a depression of CNS activity in different areas of the central nervous system, which results in equilibrium of the autonomic nervous system discharge, thus, reducing the overshoot of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic tone ( Figure II-63) . Mixed agonist/antagonists, when given in dosages above the therapeutic range, induce a cardiostimulatory sympathomimetic effect, which purportedly is induced via stimulation of -receptor sites [165] . As a result, tachycardia, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance, and an increase in pulmonary artery pressure are induced (Table II- 13) , all of which increase myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Therefore agonist/antagonists should not be given above their therapeutic range in patients with MI or with a preexistent cardiovascular disease [166] .",

Since this is mainly seen when N 2 O is given in concentrations above 50% with a resultant drop in FIO 2 , this very Both agents dose-dependently reduce adrenaline-induced ventricular extrasystoles. Adapted from [180] PVC-premature ventricular countraction likely is due to an insufficient myocardial oxygen supply. In addition, high concentrations of N 2 O have a direct vasodilatory effect, resulting in a reduction of venous return to the heart and a drop in blood pressure [174] . It therefore is advocated that in patients receiving opioid anesthesia with a preexisting cardiovascular disease, the optimal concentration in FIO 2 should be around 0.5. Opioids also have been demonstrated to induce an anti-arrhythmic effect. This has been shown in the animal for meptazinol [175] and in experimental coronary artery occlusion, using fentanyl, sufentanil and carfentanil respectively [176, 177, 178] (Figure II-64 ). The reason for such an antifibrillatory effect seems to be due to the increase in vagal tone [179] .",
