Morbidity and mortality in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are linked to persistent viral replication and evolution to CHB\u2010related liver cirrhosis (CHB\u2010LC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [3]. In China, four nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA), i.e. lamivudine (LAM), adefovir (ADV), entecavir (ETV) and telbivudine (LdT) are currently approved for the treatment of HBV infection, whilst recently developed tenofovir (TDF) is still unavailable. Treatment of CHB and CHB\u2010LC is aimed at suppressing viral replication to the lowest possible level, and thereby halting the progression of liver disease. However, viral resistance is the main drawback of long\u2010term antiviral therapy [4, 5, 6]. Suboptimal treatment regimens and drug\u2010resistant viral infection can increase the incidence of drug resistance and may favour the selection of multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR) HBV [7, 8].",

The rtM204I and rtM204V are classic LAM\u2010resistant mutations and often coexist with compensatory mutations (rtV173L and rtL180M) [9, 10, 11]. The rtN236T and rtA181V are two well\u2010recognized ADV\u2010resistant mutations [12, 13], and some purported mutations such as rtV84M, rtV214A, rtQ215S, rtL217R and rtI233V may reduce susceptibility to ADV, although these are still controversial [13, 14, 15, 16]. Substitutions in rtT184, rtS202 or rtM250 in conjunction with LAM\u2010resistant mutations result in ETV resistance [17, 18, 19]. Cross\u2010resistance (usually rtM204I) also exists between LdT and LAM [20]. In addition, rtA181T seems to be an atypical substitution associated with LAM and ADV selection and may reduce the typical extent of virologic breakthrough [21].",

The incidence of genotypic resistance is related to viral factors, host factors and treatment characteristics and is also affected by the methods used for detection of resistance mutations and the patient population being studied [22]. Several methods have been used for typing HBV genetic drug\u2010resistant mutations, each with individual advantages and disadvantages [1, 22]. Direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing is the most popular method owing to the abundant information it provides. However, it is also considered less sensitive for typing samples with low viral load (<2000 IU/mL) and minor mutant subpopulations (<20%) [22].",

Nonoptimal strategies based on the sequential use of NA increase the development of MDR strains [23]. Knowledge on the incidence and patterns of drug\u2010resistant mutants is valuable for clinicians and would assist clinical monitoring and management of the resistance. To date, data are largely derived from a few clinical trials and cohorts with limited drug resistance profiling. This study is intended to investigate population\u2010based profiles of HBV genotypic resistance in Chinese patients, with an improved direct PCR sequencing assay.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus drug resistance develops in succession as genotypic resistance, phenotypic resistance of virologic breakthrough and biochemical/clinical breakthrough [30, 31]. Early discovery of genotypic resistance allows timely adjustment of therapy strategies to avoid virologic rebound and hepatitis flare and to distinguish suboptimal responses caused by nonviral factors. Satisfying this clinical requirement needs a high\u2010sensitive resistance\u2010typing assay. Though direct sequencing is widely used to detect \u2018new\u2019 substitutions, and taken as a \u2018gold standard\u2019, it is considered as a relatively less\u2010sensitive assay [22]. We developed a high\u2010sensitive nested PCR assay allowing us to analyse samples with quite low viral load as we did for the SARS coronavirus [32, 33, 34]. In this study, HBV DNA levels were quantitated in the Central Clinical Laboratory of the hospital, and we performed the direct PCR sequencing assay without knowing the viral load beforehand. Thus, the sequencing success rates in relation to serum HBV DNA levels are substantially objective. A small proportion of samples were positive (i.e., \u2265100 IU/mL) in HBV DNA quantitation by routine qPCR but negative in HBV gene amplification for direct sequencing. In fact, this is for the 28/393 samples in group B (\u2265100 IU/mL but <2000 IU/mL) and the 5/313 samples in group C (\u22652000 IU/mL but <20 000 IU/mL), although a lower detection limit of the latter assay was set at 20 IU/mL with a calibration standard. This may be attributed to differences between methodologies, e.g. the direct PCR sequencing assay needs to amplify much longer viral gene fragments than routine qPCR does and thus will be influenced more by virus disintegration. A similar phenomenon was also observed by other investigators [35]. Although line probe assays can detect minor sequences as low as 5% in the virus pool, an HBV DNA concentration no less than 104 IU/mL is required [36]. In our one\u2010tube PCR assay, all amplicons from the first\u2010round PCR were subjected to the second\u2010round PCR. The inhibitory effect of the first\u2010round PCR products was eliminated by a special technique (Chinese patent application number: 200910092331.1), which contributed the most to the higher sensitivity of this assay. These advantages plus low cost permitted the use of the direct PCR sequencing assay for monitoring of drug resistance in the clinic.",

This offers a circumstantial explanation for frequent and rapid relapse of many NA responders when treatment is discontinued [37, 38]. The resistance mutations were detected in 48 patients with viral load less than 100 IU/mL, suggesting that low viral replication may reduce but not prevent drug resistance development. In clinical practice, HBV DNA quantitation is still more practicable than genotypic resistance testing to monitor drug resistance for patients with good virologic response considering cost\u2010effectiveness. It was observed that patients with moderate levels of HBV DNA (2000\u201320 000 IU/mL) had higher resistance mutation incidence (41.9%) than those with higher viral load. One explanation could be that in the presence of the antiviral agent, suboptimal suppression of virus replication may provide greater replication advantage of the mutants against the wild type than poor suppression of virus replication does [39]. Other influence factors may include differences in treatment strategy and duration.",

This is consistent with the findings by other groups [40, 41, 42]. Interestingly, LAM\u2010R patterns were also detected frequently in the ADV add\u2010on group. One possible reason is that ADV has relatively weaker potency to suppress LAM\u2010resistant mutants whilst LAM has stronger potency to suppress ADV\u2010resistant ones. The rtM204V was usually concomitant with rtL180M. Therefore, LAM switching\u2010to LdT is unsuitable once YMDD mutations occurred, as LdT is ineffective against both rtM204I and rtL180M + M204V mutants, though it remains effective against the single rtM204V mutation [6]. Pre\u2010existing ETV\u2010R patterns were detected in some LAM\u2010experienced and ETV\u2010na\u00efve patients. This may account for primary resistance or rapid failure to ETV treatment in some LAM\u2010refractory patients.",

We found that the incidence of rtM204I concomitant with rtL180M was significantly higher in genotype C than in genotype B, and patients with rtM204I + L180M had a higher ALT level compared to those with rtM204I alone. As rtL180M can compensate for the replication capacity of the YMDD mutant and higher viral replication may induce stronger immune responses, it is plausible that elevated ALT was associated with the fluctuating cycle of viral replication and hepatic inflammation. Consistent with this is the observation that rtL180M with rtM204I have been reported to decrease serum ALT normalization significantly after ADV therapy [44].",

Nevertheless, because nucleoside (LAM, ETV and LdT) and nucleotide analogues (ADV) usually have a complementary cross\u2010resistance profile when they are used in combination and MDR HBV strains usually replicate their genome less efficiently than either wild\u2010type HBV or monodrug\u2010resistant mutants do, the MDR HBV strains resistant to both types of NA occur infrequently in the clinic. To date, reports on clinical MDR HBV strains are restricted to double resistance against LAM and ADV [23, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], if rtA181T/V cross\u2010resistance alone and anti\u2010HBs immunoglobulin resistance are excluded. In this study, RT sequences with MDR mutational patterns were identified from eight patients receiving sequential NA. Interestingly, triple resistance against LAM, ADV and ETV was found which to our knowledge has not been reported previously. Dynamic analysis showed that MDR HBV strains developed in close relation to sequential drug administration and in accordance with clinical features. Coexistence of monodrug\u2010resistant mutants may favour the emergence of MDR strains. Although in vitro phenotyping was not performed in this study, it has been shown that MDR strains with signature mutations to both LAM and ADV (rtM204V + A181V/N236T) have competent replicative capacity in the presence of LAM and ADV and obviously reduced susceptibility to each of the drugs in comparison with wild\u2010type stains [51, 52].",
