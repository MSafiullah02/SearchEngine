They are usually similar to the authentic viruses they are derived from, but non-infectious because they are free of viral genetic material (for review see Pumpens and Grens, 2002). In contrast to exogenous antigens, which usually are processed via MHC class II pathway, non-replicating antigens as VLP are able to enter the MHC class I pathway, the main pathway for CD8+ T cell activation, by cross-presentation (Keller et al., 2010, Storni and Bachmann, 2004, Storni et al., 2002). This is probably due to their macromolecular structure and particulate nature.",

Members of more than 30 viral families have been tested as putative VLP carriers by fusing peptides of interest to the coat protein and exposing them on the surfaces of the assembled VLPs. Some of these modified VLPs were shown to be highly immunogenic antigen carriers, capable to induce strong humoral immune responses against inserted antigens (Buonaguro et al., 2002, Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2010, Kang et al., 2009, Zvirbliene et al., 2006), and some antigen carrying VLPs were able to induce CTL responses, as well (Ding et al., 2009, Lacasse et al., 2008). However, for the induction of a strong CTL response most VLPs have to be administered together with adjuvant-like molecules such as CpGs or anti-CD40 (Schwarz et al., 2005, Storni et al., 2002).",

In addition, HaPyV VP1-based chimeric VLPs produced by yeast induce a strong insert-specific humoral response without adjuvant and represent useful tools for generating monoclonal antibodies with desired specificity (Zvirbliene et al., 2006). HaPyV VP1 VLPs are able to trigger maturation of human dendritic cells (DC), IL-12 production and stimulation of CD8+ T cells in vitro more efficiently than VLPs of other polyomaviruses (JCV, BKV, SV40 or MPyV; Gedvilaite et al., 2006). Interestingly that chimeric mouse polyomavirus capsid protein based VLPs harboring tumor antigens were shown to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse model (Andreasson et al., 2009, Brinkman et al., 2005). In contrast, information about the capacity of HaPyV VP1 based chimeric VLPs to induce effective epitope-specific CTL immune response in vivo is still missing.",

GP33 peptide corresponding to an H-2Db-restricted CTL epitope (aa residues 33\u201341) from surface glycoprotein of Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was chosen as model antigen (Pircher et al., 1989) based on several already published features: (i) GP33 is a strong CTL epitope presented by H-2Db MHC molecules and recognized in this context by specific CD8+ T cells (Pircher et al., 1990); (ii) GP33 allows tracing of GP33-specific CD8+ T cell response in normal mice; (iii) the GP33 epitope has been widely used as a tumor-associated model antigen. Depending on the tumor cell type and the antigen expression levels different tumor specific immune functions were characterized such as: T cell priming (Kundig et al., 1995, Prevost-Blondel et al., 1998), spontaneous tumor regression (Prevost-Blondel et al., 2000), ignorance (Hermans et al., 1998, Ochsenbein et al., 1999, Speiser et al., 1997), or tolerance induction (Ochsenbein et al., 2001).",

The VLPs were purified by ultracentrifugation in 20\u201360% sucrose gradient (100,000 \u00d7 \ng, 4 h) followed by 0.5 h incubation with a DNAse-free RNAse (Fermentas UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania) and by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 \u00d7 \ng for 48 h on CsCl gradient (1.23\u20131.38 g/mL). Fractions containing purified proteins were collected, pooled, dialyzed against PBS, lyophilized and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use. All purified VLPs were examined for nucleic acid contaminations according to a protocol described previously (Sasnauskas et al., 1999) and DNA/RNA was not detected.",

The antitumor protective capacity was investigated by time course measurement of tumor progression. The GP33-unspecific response against the MCA102 tumor in all 6 VP1-GP33 VLPs immunized mice (Fig. 4\nA) was very similar to the response in PBS-treated control mice: the tumor growth was progressive. MCA102-GP33 tumors in all 7 PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 4B) and parental MCA102 tumors in all 6 mice immunized with VP1-GP33 VLPs (Fig. 4A) reached the size of 50 mm2 until day 12 (in VP1-GP33-1 VLPs-treated mice) or day 14 (in VP1-GP33-4 VLPs-treated mice) post tumor injection. In contrast, prophylactic immunization with VLPs partly protected mice from MCA102-GP33 tumor growth: only 1/7 VP1-GP33-4 VLP immunized mice, 0/7 VP1-GP33-1 VLP immunized mice and 3/7 mice immunized with empty carrier VP1 VLP compared to 7/7 control na\u00efve mice developed tumors of 50 mm2 size until day 12 (Fig. 3B).

By that time 3/7 (42%) and 4/7 (57%) mice immunized with VP1-GP33-1 and VP1-GP33-4 VLPs accordingly had tumors smaller than 50 mm2 and only 1/7 and 1/7 (14%) mice developed tumors bigger than 100 mm2.

As it is known that LCMV infection in vivo is exclusively controlled by CD8+ T cells, an absence of virus elimination reflects an absence of cytotoxic T cell activity (Bachmann, 1997). Immunization with chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs without adjuvant induced protective immune response in mice: 7/10 (70%) mice were fully and 3/10 (30%) mice partially protected against LCMV challenge (Fig. 3B) suggesting effective insert-specific CD8+ T cell induction in vivo. Not all VLPs were able to stimulate effective and long lasting CTL response in vivo, especially without additional adjuvant (Ding et al., 2009, Lacasse et al., 2008, Martinez et al., 2003). Interestingly, immunization with chimeric hepatitis B core Ag VLPs harboring LCMV GP33 peptide fully protected mice from LCMV challenge infection only when they were applied with CpG-rich DNA (Storni et al., 2002).",

In LCMV immune mice MCA102-GP33 tumor cells are fully rejected. However, LCMV therapy only temporarily eliminates this tumor and finally tumor escape variants appear (Blohm et al., 2002). In mice vaccinated with chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs and challenged with MCA102-GP33 tumor, tumor growth was delayed compared to mice injected with PBS which means that memory CD8+ CTLs were activated (Fig. 4B). This capability of HaPyV VP1-based VLPs to induce effective CTL response in mice was supported also by a therapeutic effect against MCA102-GP33 tumor (Fig. 4C). CD8+ T cells activated by VLPs were able to identify and eliminate not only inoculated tumor cell suspensions but also solid tumor cells under in vivo situations. However, the weaker antitumor effect induced by VLPs when compared with the LCMV-induced antitumor effect (Blohm et al., 2002) could be the result of IFN\u03b3 production deficiency in splenocytes after stimulation with VLPs because it is known that IFN\u03b3 seems to be the only effector molecule in MCA102 tumor model (Blohm et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Surprisingly, immunization with empty VP1 VLPs showed to some extent a protective antitumor effect. CD8+ T cell activation in vivo induced by empty VP1 VLPs was not as efficient as the activation observed for chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs but clearly detectable. It might be possible that injection of the VP1 VLP induced in mice a non-specific activation of the immune system which in turn was responsible for an antitumor effect. However, it should be noted that VP1-G33 VLPs had a GP33-specific stimulatory effect on GP33-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro (Fig. 2A and B). Furthermore, prophylactic immunization with VLPs clearly delayed MCA102-GP33 tumor growth but had no effect on parental MCA102 tumor cell line growth in mice (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, it is more likely that VP1 VLPs induced activation of cross-reactive memory CD8+ T cells. It is known that only a few TCR contact residues on the peptide presented by MHC molecules are required for activation and a TCR of CD8+ T cell can tolerate certain amino acid substitutions in the peptide sequence. Therefore antigen specific CD8+ T memory cells can cross-react with different epitopes derived either from the same or a related antigen, or a totally unrelated one. Examples of cross-reactive T-cell responses involving completely unrelated viruses such as LCMV and vaccinia virus (Kim et al., 2005), influenza virus and HIV (Acierno et al., 2003), human papilloma virus and coronavirus (Nilges et al., 2003), have been reported.",

Although one report that VLP-specific antibodies have a negative influence on antigen presentation impaired the induction of protective immune responses (Da Silva et al., 2001), several other studies described that specific T-cell responses to non-replicating vaccines were rather improved than reduced by the presence of specific antibodies (Den Hann and Bevan, 2002, Kalergis and Ravetch, 2002, Ruedl et al., 2005). The specific antibodies may facilitate CTL activation by enhancing opsonization of VLPs leading to a stronger antigen presentation and CTL activation. So, the presence of specific antibodies could be an advantage for enhancing GP33 specific CTL response induced by chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs.",
