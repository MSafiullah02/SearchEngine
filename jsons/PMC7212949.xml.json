Many communities and countries have enforced restrictions, permitting only essential activities. Health systems around the globe are currently preparing to manage the surge of the influx of critically ill patients. During this phase, care providers, administrators, and policymakers work in concert to understand and combat this deadly pandemic. The current knowledge about COVID-19 is limited but rapidly evolving. During this outbreak, the medical community used evidence gleaned from past outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to predict COVID-19\u2019s behavior, clinical presentation and treatment. In addition, coronaviruses are known to cause signs and symptoms of multi-organ system damage, many of which are subtle and can go unnoticed by trained medical professionals. Furthermore, frontline healthcare personnel lack a comprehensive review of the numerous clinical pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations of deadly coronaviruses making self-education time consuming.",

Before December 2019, there were six known human coronaviruses, including the alpha-CoVs, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, and the beta-CoVs, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome-COV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) [2]. The recently identified COVID-19 is a beta-CoV that infects both humans and animals. All three of these novel viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19) originate from zoonotic transmission. Bats may have served as the source of SARS-CoV and COVID-19 based on sequence similarity with bat coronaviruses. Camels are suspected to have been the zoonotic host for transmission of MERS-CoV.",

The MERS-CoV caused severe pneumonia with an ICU admission rate of 40-50% and an in-hospital ICU death rate of 75% [6,7]. In December 2019, the city of Wuhan in Hubei Provence, China, reported a small outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19.

Approximately 50% of patients developed hypoxia during hospitalization, and up to 26% progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [8,12]. The elderly and patients with multiple comorbidities had particularly high (more than 15.7%) mortality [12,13]. Unilateral, focal, peripheral areas of consolidations on imaging were identified in upwards of 78% of patients [10]. Histopathology revealed diffuse serous, fibrinous and hemorrhagic inflammation. SARS-CoV RNA has been detected in type II alveolar cells, interstitial cells, and bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting infection of both proximal and distal epithelium of the lung [13]. Most patients received antibacterial antibiotics, with or without the use of ribavirin and corticosteroids 9, 10, 11.",

The presence of dyspnea is predictive of ICU admission [21]. In early descriptions of hospitalized patients in China, all patients had an abnormal chest computed tomography [20,22]. Ground glass opacities are common (56%), followed by consolidation and interstitial abnormalities [21]. In a large Chinese study, the course was complicated by ARDS in 3.4% patients, 6.1% required mechanical ventilation, and the case fatality rate was 1.4-2.1% [21]. Other studies noted a higher incidence of ARDS among hospitalized patients (29%), and higher mortality (15%) [20,22]. Respiratory failure tends to have a delayed onset, occurring approximately one week after the onset of symptoms. Patients with critical illness were on average older (median age 66 vs 51 non-critically patients) and had more comorbidities [20]. Patients who received invasive mechanical ventilatory support were more likely to be male and obese [23]. Histopathology of the lung shows diffuse alveolar damage, denuded alveolar lining cells, and interstitial fibrosis [24]. There is also evidence of a higher incidence of thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients and an association between elevated D-dimer levels and mortality [25]. Additionally, preliminary evidence suggests that heparin use may result in lower 28-day mortality rates when compared to in COVID-19 patients not receiving this therapy [26].",

CK-MB and hs-cTnI were higher in ICU patients, suggesting that myocardial injury is more likely present in patients with severe disease [45,46]. As many as 7% of deaths in COVID-19 patients have been attributed to myocardial injury [47]. Other cardiac manifestations include acute MI, fulminant heart failure, and dysrhythmias [48]. In some studies, arrhythmia with COVID-19 infection was as high as 17% [20,45]. It is also important to note various drug interactions and the arrhythmogenic potential of medications often used in these patients. Additionally, patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been seen to suffer from more severe disease requiring critical care [48].",

Approximately 60% of patients with SARS-CoV had a degree of liver impairment with elevated ALT and or AST, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperbilirubinemia [53] (Table 2\n). ACE2 receptors are also found on the hepatic endothelial cells [54]. On histopathology, SARS-CoV patients had a large number of virus particles in the hepatic parenchymal cells [38,39,55]. Elevated levels of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 in patients with SARS-CoV hepatitis support coexisting acute inflammatory response [56]. Hepatic cell damage and cell-cycle disruption was seen on hepatic biopsy with apoptosis, mitotic arrest with eosinophilic bodies, and balloon-like hepatocytes [22]. Unfortunately, hepatic damage potentially due to antivirals use complicates our understanding of the etiology of hepatitis in patients with SARS-CoV [57]. Hepatic involvement may indicate a poor prognosis, particularly in patients with high LDH levels [58]. Yang et al. reported long-standing hyperglycemia (due to pancreatic injury) as an independent predictor for adverse outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV [58].",

However, MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase-4 to infect cells (DPP-4), which is highly expressed in the liver [62,63]. In transgenic mice, the liver injury occurred within the first week after infection resulting in hepatic necrosis and infiltration of Kupffer cells and macrophages [64]. Similar to other coronavirus infections, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines are noted in the acute phase, including IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-15, and IL-17 [65].

The most common gastrointestinal presentation was loss of appetite (up to 55%) and watery diarrhea (up to 76%) [69,71] (Table 3\n). Patients also complained of nausea, vomiting (14-22.2%) and abdominal pain (3.5-12.6%) [72]. The association between symptoms and outcomes had been mixed. Leung et al. found that patients with diarrhea had a higher likelihood of requiring ICU admission and ventilatory support [68]. Others found that GI symptoms at presentation conferred a better prognosis [69]. Others found no association between diarrhea and the development of ARDS or the requirement of ventilatory support [70]. The mechanism of GI symptoms is unclear, but SARS-CoV particles have been detected in saliva (100%), feces (97%), and mucosal epithelial and lymphoid tissue of affected patients with associated depletion of lymphoid tissue [72].",

Vomiting has been shown to be a more common presenting symptoms in children. The GI features seem to worsen with overall disease severity and the presence of abdominal pain has been associated with about 4 times higher odds of severe COVID [22,24]. The delayed recognition of GI symptoms and lack of awareness may lead to a delay in seeking medical care [22]. Patients who present later during their illness were more likely to suffer from hepatic dysfunction but without a difference in mortality, ICU days, or time to discharge [22]. Patients with obesity are at significantly higher risk for severe disease requiring critical care and invasive mechanical ventilation. Compared with patients with a BMI <25 kg/m2, patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 have been seen to have 7 times the odds for requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [25,26].",

However, acute renal failure was noted in 5-15% of patients and more often developed subsequently 7-20 days after presentation 89, 90, 91, 92. Choi et al. reported a 6% incidence of acute renal failure in a study of 267 patients, more commonly in elderly diabetics. A large study with 536 patients stated that patients with ARF had hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia at the time of admission [75,91]. Patients with renal dysfunction had mortality rates around 90% [75,90,91,93,94]. Patients with hypouricemia and chronic renal replacement therapy also had poor outcomes 95, 96, 97.",

The incidence of acute kidney injury either at presentation or later is as high as 15% with a high mortality rate of 60-90% [106,107] (Table 4). Other researchers report albuminuria or proteinuria on admission in 44-63% patients, hematuria in 27%, elevated urea, and creatinine in 13-27% and 14-19%, respectively, and low eGFR in 13% [104,105]. There may also be imaging evidence of active renal edema and inflammation [104]. Since renal dysfunction is early, an immunopathology response or direct viral injury may be contributing along with other systemic factors [20,92]. Similar to other novel coronaviruses, renal involvement, acute or chronic, tends to associate with an adverse prognosis [22,105,107]. The COVID-19 virus has been detected in renal tissue and in the urine [39,70,108]. Due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules, it is also reasonable to speculate that testicular injury may be a consequence of COVID-19 infection [109].",

As many as 36.4% patients have neurological symptoms, and these are seen more commonly in patients with severe disease [42]. Acute cerebrovascular accidents, altered mental status, and myopathy occurred in approximately one-third of patients. In an observational series of 58 COVID-19 positive patients, Helms et al documented confusion and agitation as the most common neurologic symptoms. Corticospinal tract signs were also evident in nearly two-thirds of patients including increased deep tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes [43]. One recent case report described acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in a patient with COVID-19 infection [44]. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been observed after the onset of COVID-19 in a few patients presenting with lower-limb weakness and paresthesia as well as facial diplegia and ataxia [45]. Neurological involvement is present in more severely affected patients, and patients with central neurologic symptoms also had severe lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and uremia [42].

Patients with severe disease may have higher total white cell counts (Table 7) (median 6100 cells/mm3) [20,21]. Otherwise, similar to the other novel coronavirus infections, lymphopenia is a frequent finding, is present in a third of patients [21,130]. Hence, lymphopenia may help as a reference index [130]. However, there may not be any differences in lymphocyte counts between mild and severe forms of COVID-19. Neutrophilia may help to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Hemoglobin seems to be mostly unaffected by COVID-19 infection. DIC is a rare complication [21]. In general, mild thrombocytopenia is present in one-third of patients [21]. Patients requiring ICU admissions are seen to have higher levels of D-dimer [14]. A meta-analysis of 9 studies showed significantly higher PT and d-dimer levels in patients with more severe disease, indicating the likelihood of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or a highly inflammatory state [56]. The incidence of thromboembolic events in these patients is garnering a lot of attention. A study conducted by Llitjos et al found a 69% incidence of thromboembolic events, with a 56% incidence even in patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation [57]. Increased levels of circulatory cytokines, ferritin, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin also seem to correlate with the severity of the disease [34,58].",

Four of the seven women presenting in the first trimester miscarried, though this finding is confounded by treatment with the purported teratogen Ribavirin in six patients. When compared to matched controls (n=10), the rate of ICU admission was significantly higher in the pregnant group (60% vs. 17.5%, P = 0.012). Three pregnant women died, whereas no women died in the matched non-pregnant group (P = 0.01) [132]. Of the five women presenting in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, four delivered preterm, one spontaneously due to preterm labor and three iatrogenic due to worsening maternal status [133].",

A study on thirty-eight third trimester pregnant women did not show any severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation or maternal deaths, despite co-morbid conditions. There were also no fetal or neonatal deaths [152]. Another study (thirteen women in the second and third trimesters) reported one ARDS and septic shock case with a stillbirth at 34 weeks of gestation [153]. Other reports on women with gestational ages of 25 to 39 weeks raise concern for an increased risk of preterm rupture of membranes and preterm delivery 153, 154, 155. However, in contrast, a retrospective study of sixteen pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared with 45 non-infected pregnant women showed no differences in preterm labor or preterm delivery, though the youngest gestational age included was only 35 weeks. Also, there was no difference in birth weight between the two groups [152]. Pathophysiology in obstetric patients could be due to naturally suppressed cell-mediated immunity and physiologic respiratory changes [142]. A noteworthy observation by Abbas et al has been an increasing incidence of hydatiform moles with the onset of the pandemic. The majority of these cases were primigravidae without other risk factors. They suggest an immune mediated mechanism triggered by the virus and recommend COVID testing in all women with hydatiform moles [65].",
