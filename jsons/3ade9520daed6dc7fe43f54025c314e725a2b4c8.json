Like all rights under the Charter, section 6 is subject to the reasonable limits provision of section 1. As one of the few Charter rights limited specifically to citizens, policy decisions such as turning away irregular migrants at the Canada-US border (Russell, 2020) do not have implications in the section 6 context (although that policy raises important human rights questions beyond the scope of this article).",

Provinces like New Brunswick and Quebec recently announced that police would limit border crossings to essential traffic only (MacKinnon, 2020; Willing, 2020) . Provinces have jurisdictional authority to act in the interest of health and safety, but these particular initiatives raise the question of discriminatory treatment on the basis of province of residency and thus may not be permissible under section 6(3) for that reason. In the midst of the crisis, governments have not done a particularly good job articulating the specifics of these policies, or their fundamental purpose. The Quebec policy, for example, appears to be an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus to regions of the province that lack the services to handle a significant surge in cases. Indeed, the government established intra-provincial checkpoints, not just checkpoints at the Quebec-Ontario border (Government of Quebec, 2020). To the extent that restricting movement applies both to residents within Quebec and to those attempting to come in from out of province, it is likely permissible under section 6.",

Two of the most fundamental changes are that under the Emergencies Act, a declaration of an emergency is reviewable by Parliament, and any temporary measures enacted under it are reviewable under the Charter. There is questionable benefit to use of the Emergencies Act during a pandemic, in part because so much of public health is governed at the provincial level. By contrast, the Quarantine Act has obvious relevance, and the constitutionality of some of its provisions-which would permit arrest for those refusing to self-isolate or permit the creation of quarantine zones, for example-remains unclear.",

Nor have there been any major societal disruptions or widespread resistance to selfisolation messaging (although reports that some returning travellers have been going to grocery stores in violation of self-isolation guidelines is what precipitated the federal government's decision to invoke the Quarantine Act) (Connolly, 2020) . Absent these factors, enforcing quarantines, along with the criminal penalties that might accompany them, would risk unreasonably violating sections 7 or 9 of the Charter. Section 7 permits the limitation of the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof \"except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\" These principles include protections against laws that are overly broad in application, grossly disproportionate in the harms they impose relative to their benefits, or arbitrary. Limits on section 9 would face similar scrutiny under the Oakes test (particularly at the stage of assessing \"minimal impairment\" of the rights in question). The government has been prudent in refraining from exercising these powers too broadly.",

The announcement was met on social media with alarm that the government was opening the door to widespread and unlimited carding-a practice also referred to as \"street checks\" and one that has been practised with well-established evidence of systemic racism (Tobias and Joseph, 2018) . However, the policy as articulated appears only to apply to those being charged with an offence under the province's Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (Government of Ontario, 2020). If the policy granted an unlimited power to require people to identify themselves to police, it would likely violate sections 7 and 9 of the Charter, as well as have obvious implications for equality rights. As a targeted and explicitly temporary grant of power, the new regulation is akin to existing law requiring that those charged with trespassing identify themselves, and it is likely a reasonable limit on legal rights.",

Although the Charter has not generally been interpreted to protect economic or \"positive\" rights, once the government establishes a program, it must provide benefits in a non-discriminatory manner (Macfarlane, 2018) . Among the protected grounds covered by section 15 is age. Governments are likely to enjoy significant latitude in carving out eligibility factors, particularly when considering career-stage factors that happen to correlate to age (Supreme Court of Canada, Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2002). Nonetheless, decision makers will want to evaluate eligibility criteria with some consideration of systemic impact along different dimensions, including gender or people with disabilities.

While courts may be regarded as the \"guardians\" of the constitution, the executive and legislative branches enjoy a responsibility to uphold rights themselves (Hiebert, 2002; Baker, 2010) . Even in the midst of a crisis and rapid deployment of new policies designed to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, consideration of factors such as proportionality and ensuring policies are not arbitrary by holding fast to existing evidence can go some way to ensuring that limits on rights remain minimal and reasonable.",
