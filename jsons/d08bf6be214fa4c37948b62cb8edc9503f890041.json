The competitive blocking ELISA format showed the highest sensitivity, allowing detection of 10 3 TCID 50 TGEV/ml in culture medium. Ninety-nine porcine field faecal samples obtained from 37 herds affected with diarrhoea were examined, and various TGEV levels were found in nine samples from six herds. However, only in three samples were significant TGEV concentrations demonstrated. The relationship between incidence of TGEV gastroenteritis and the spread of porcine respiratory coronavirus infection in pig farms is discussed.",

            "text": "Rotaviruses and coronaviruses rank, along with bacterial infections, among the most significant causal agents of gastroenteritis in pigs. The two coronaviruses causing transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) are morphologically identical, but they are antigenically different. TGE gastroenteritis, occurring mostly in the enzootic form, is not such a problem in Europe as it was in the past (S\u02c7te\u02c7pa\u00b4nek et al., 1972; Pritchard et al., 1999) . Although different results on the prevalence of TGEV infection were given (Kim and Cho, 1998; Chae et al., 2000) , this infection still may be topical in some countries. Decreased incidence of TGE gastroenteritis is largely influenced by the spread of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection in pig herds (Bernard et al., 1989; S\u02c7esta\u00b4k et al., 1996) . High level of nucleotide sequence homology (98%) of the two viruses was proven by genome analysis (Britton et al., 1991) with major deletions in genome coding S protein of PRCV. Therefore, it is presumed that PRCV is a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV, and minor alterations of the viral genome led to distinct viral tropism (Rasschaert et al., 1990; S\u02c7esta\u00b4k et al., 1996; Ballesteros et al., 1997; Constantini et al., 2004) .",

Weak reactivity of mAb D3/G6 with epitopes present on protein M and nucleoprotein N were detected (Fig. 1) . Conformational changes of viral antigens resulted in markedly decreased or even absent reactiveness of mAb B4/F2 in WB analysis. All mAb used reacted specifically with native TGEV strains in IP (Fig. 2) and ELISA tests according to results given in Table 1 . Indirect ELISA titres of individual mAbTGEV solutions containing 5 mg Ig/ml ranged between 2 \u00b7 10 5 and 4 \u00b7 10 6 . Cross reactivity of mAb with other viral antigens (rotavirus A and PEDV) could not be detected by any of methods used. The reactivity of individual mAb with five TGEV strains was checked by CB-ELISA examination of infectious culture media. According to obtained positive NA and %B values, the mAb D7/G7 and B7/F7 react with all TGEV strains, while mAb D3/G6 and B4/F2 react with strains V-344 and Cz-1995 only. By the use of mAb D7/G7 alone or mixture of mAb in CB-ELISA examination of various TGEV strains (Table 1) or positive field faecal samples (results not shown) the same results were obtained.

We supposed that mAb against N and M antigens of various TGEV strains could be useful for this purpose in spite of their crossreactivity with PRCV. Faecal shedding of PRCV after infection was demonstrated by nested-RT-PCR (Constantini et al., 2004) . However, the demonstration of ingested virus cannot be excluded. Little if any enteric multiplication of PRCV was demonstrated by immunofluorescence after experimental infection of 1-week-old piglets only, and it remained limited to a few unidentified cells located in or underneath the epithelial layer of the villi and/or crypts (Cox et al., 1990a,b,c) . The RT-PCR is extremely sensitive allowing RNA detection of only occasional viral particles in the sample. Although the sensitivity of TGEV detection by CB-ELISA in faecal samples is sufficient (10 3 TCID 50 TGEV/ml), we suppose that the possibility to demonstrate traces of PRCV is relatively low. Nevertheless, this assumption will be further checked by application of RT-PCR in following experiments.",

            "text": "The sensitivities of TGEV detection by DAS-ELISA and CB-ELISA were compared and higher sensitivity and specificity of the last method was proven. While in DAS-ELISA conjugated mAb are used, CB-ELISA method is based on the use of unconjugated mAb. The results obtained also indicate (Tables 2 and 3 ). This was confirmed by examination of 99 field faecal samples; nine of them were TGEV positive. However, high TGEV concentrations, suggesting that the virus is an important causative agent of gastroenteritis, were detected in three samples only. Moreover, in all TGEVpositive samples, the presence of rotavirus A and/or PEDV was demonstrated, indicating the importance of mixed enteric viral infections (results not shown). The demonstration of TGEV antibodies in only one of 81 randomly selected field sow serum samples indicates that the animals produce antibodies if the TGEV antigenic stimulation is high enough to compete with the stimulation by other enteric pathogens. The results also correlate with the assumption that the immunity of sows to PRCV leads to decreased occurrence of TGEV gastroenteritis (Bernard et al., 1989; Lanza et al., 1995; S\u02c7esta\u00b4k et al., 1996) . Effectivity of virus detection in faecal samples may be affected by the time of sample collection after the first symptoms of diarrhoea had emerged and the conditions of their shipment. Marked destruction of coronaviruses occurs in the gastric and intestinal contents (Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984) . It follows, that characteristic structures of coronaviruses are less frequent by EM examination and cellular substructures may imitate \u00d4corona-like\u00d5 particles. This can explain low correlation between EM and CB-ELISA results.",
