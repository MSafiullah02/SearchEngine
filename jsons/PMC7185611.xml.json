            "text": "RNA interference [also called \u2018RNA\u2010mediated interference\u2019 (RNAi)] is a mechanism for RNA\u2010guided regulation of gene expression in which double\u2010stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) inhibits the expression of genes with complementary nucleotide sequences. The functional mediator of RNAi is small interfering RNAs (siRNA). The dsRNA has been shown to be a potent sequence\u2010specific inhibitor of gene function in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [1]. RNAi has been described in several eukaryotic unicellular organisms like Trypanosoma brucei [2] and also in multicellular organisms like C. elegans [1], Drosophila [3], Planaria [4, 5], Hydra [6], plants [7], zebrafish [8], mice [9, 10, 11] and humans [12, 13]. Several observations suggest that RNAi involves some active processes. For example, siRNA delivered by microinjection into the intestine exerts interference effects in tissues in both the injected animal and its progeny [1], suggesting the presence of activities that transport and perhaps amplify the interfering agent. This technology is an extremely useful tool for identifying gene functions and evaluating potential therapeutic targets. So, an increasing number of biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies are attempting to develop RNAi\u2010based drugs for the prevention and treatment of human disease such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, viral infections, cancer, etc. [14, 15, 16]. Currently, for many diseases like heart failure and cancer, surgery remains the only option because the drugs for treating the diseases are not available. Although siRNA\u2010based therapy is still in infancy, it holds tremendous promise for use in routine clinical practice as an adjunct to existing procedures as it can help to overcome the limitations associated with current therapeutic regimens [17, 18]. In the present review, we have discussed the basics of siRNA and the therapeutic applications of this technology for various disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, infectious diseases, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatic disorders and others.",

Processing starts from the ends of the blunt\u2010ended dsRNA or dsRNAs with short 3\u2032 overhangs and proceeds in 21\u201323 nucleotide steps. The resulting fragments (siRNAs) are bound by RNAi\u2010specific enzymes possibly still including Dicer and could be incorporated into a distinct nuclease complex, the \u2018RNA\u2010induced silencing complex\u2019. This complex comprising of siRNAs, RNAi\u2010specific enzyme (including Dicer) and nuclease, targets mRNA for the process of degradation. In this complex, siRNAs pair with the target mRNA and cleave the mRNA in the center of the region recognized by the siRNA, whereby the mRNA cleavage boundaries are determined by the sequence of the dsRNA (\nFigure 1\n). Either the same ribonuclease that cleaves the dsRNA or another ribonuclease that has to be recruited cleaves the target RNA. The ribonuclease temporarily displaces the passive siRNA strand not used for target recognition. The dsRNA\u2010processing proteins or a subset of them remains associated with the siRNA duplex after the processing reaction. The orientation of the siRNA duplex relative to these proteins determines which of the two complementary strands functions in guiding target RNA degradation. (Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes guide cleavage of sense as well as antisense target RNA, as they are able to associate with protein components in either possible orientation.) The antisense strand could, for instance, interact directly with the target RNA, whereas the sense strand could more indirectly participate in RNAi, e.g. by protecting the antisense strand against ribonucleases [19, 20, 21, 22].",

            "text": "One of the many intriguing features of RNA interference is the apparent catalytic nature of the phenomenon. A few molecules of dsRNA are sufficient to degrade a continuously transcribed target mRNA for a long period of time. Although the conversion of long dsRNA into many small siRNAs results in some degree of amplification, it is not sufficient to bring about such continuous mRNA degradation. Recent studies have provided convincing biochemical and genetic evidence that RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which was first identified in plants [23], indeed plays a critical role in amplifying RNAi effects [24, 25] in some insects. An RdRp such as that encoded by the ego\u20101 gene in C. elegans or the qde\u20101 gene in Neurospora might amplify the dsRNA signal, producing long\u2010lasting post\u2010transcriptional gene silencing in the absence of the dsRNA that initiated the effect. Thereby, RdRp might convert an aberrant single\u2010stranded RNA population into dsRNA; repeatedly copy the dsRNA to produce a population of single\u2010stranded RNAs that could then interact with target RNA; or copy copies of the trigger thus generating a \u2018self\u2010replicating\u2019 trigger population. The absence of identified RdRP homologues in Drosophila and mammals suggests either that other RNA copying enzymes are used or that the primary siRNAs may be sufficient to produce detectable interference response. Regardless of whether the dsRNA signal is amplified in nature by an RdRp activity or not, it has been shown that RNAi works better when more dsRNA is used to initiate the process.",

In line with these findings, the reduced tumor growth rate was paralleled by a reduction in blood vessels in the periphery of the tumor and changes in vascular morphology of remaining vessels, supporting an antiangiogenic mechanism of action. These results were supported by studies in a model of pathological angiogenesis in the eye [70], again demonstrating vasculature\u2010specific delivery and inhibition of angiogenesis leading to therapeutic effects.

Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. The renin\u2013angiotensin system plays an important role in the development and progression of devastating disorders in patients with hypertension [72]. Angiotensin II, a physiologically active major substance of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, acts as a vasopressor by inducing vasoconstriction and elicits water and sodium absorption in the proximal renal tubule by stimulating the secretion of aldosterone [73]. It binds to two distinct receptor subtypes, namely type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2). AT1A is the primary subtype accountable for angiotensin II actions in mice [74]. Vazquez et al. selected AT1R as the target gene to design corresponding dsRNAs, and then transfected them into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), which express rat AT1R, and found an 80% decrease in the level of AT1R mRNA [75]. Furthermore, there was a dose\u2010dependent decrease in the specific binding of angiotensin II to AT1R\u2010expressing CHO cells. To determine whether the decrease in AT1R\u2010specific binding was associated with a reduction in functional AT1R, they examined the effects of dsRNA transfection on angiotensin II\u2010stimulated calcium uptake. In AT1\u2010dsRNA transfected cells, the angiotensin II\u2010induced increase in calcium uptake was completely abolished. It has been found that knocking down the expression of heat shock factor\u20101 with RNAi technology exacerbated angiotensin II\u2010induced inflammatory injury by causing significantly higher activation of nuclear factor kappa \u03b2 (NF\u2010\u03ba\u03b2) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [76]. In another research into the mechanism of hypertension, it was revealed that the RhoA\u2013Rho kinase pathway was the significant pathway behind the pathogenesis of the abnormal contraction of the VSMCs in cardiovascular diseases [77]. Knockdown of RhoA by RNAi decreases the level of RhoA mRNA and the contractility of the cultured VSMCs [78], which indicates that the expression level of RhoA played a critical role in the regulation of contractility in the de\u2010differentiated VSMC, and that RhoA could be a new therapy target for hypertension. Thus, these findings suggest that RNAi might have potential as an alternative to drug therapy for hypertension.",

Many studies have shown that macrophages and T cells play critical roles in the multiple aspects of the pathogenesis of the disease. Adiponectin has been found to enhance Akt phosphorylation [80]. Pretreatment with Akt siRNA transfection blocked the inhibitory effect of adiponectin on TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced IL\u20108 synthesis in porcine coronary artery SMC, suggesting that Akt activation might inhibit IL\u20108 synthesis, a pro\u2010inflammatory chemokine that plays a role in atherogenesis [80]. Molecular analysis indicates that the NF\u2010\u03ba\u03b2 plays a prominent role in the formation of atherosclerosis because of its ability to adhere to elements in the promoters of key inflammatory and atherosclerosis genes [81]. siRNA targeting NF\u2010\u03ba\u03b2 has been synthesized by the use of a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010based approach that generates sense and antisense siRNA separated by a hairpin loop downstream of the U6 promoter [82]. This was then transfected into the VSMC derived from 12/15\u2010Loko mice. The mRNA and protein of NF\u2010\u03ba\u03b2 and NF\u2010\u03ba\u03b2\u2010dependent transcriptional responses were reduced markedly by the siRNA. Some experiments have shown that excessive apoptosis of VSMCs plays a key role in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in many cardiovascular events [83]. GADD153, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer\u2010binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors, has been linked to apoptosis in VSMCs and inhibition of GADD153 by siRNAs reduces C\u2010reactive protein\u2010induced GADD153 mRNA expression and apoptosis [84]. In another study, it has been demonstrated that Omi/HtrA2, a serine protease, could be released into the cytosol from mitochondria and promote caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis after an apoptotic insult. Removal of Omi/HtrA2 by RNA interference has been shown to reduce UV light\u2010induced apoptosis in U2OS cells [85]. These observations may suggest new options for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

A novel human gene, myofibrillogenesis regulator\u20101 (MR\u20101) from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library that interacts with contractile proteins and exists in human myocardial myofibrils has been identified [87]. A hypertrophy model in which hypertrophic cell growth can be induced by angiotensin II incubation in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is being established. By transfecting neonatal cardiomyocytes with a pSi\u20101 targeting the MR\u20101 sequence, it was found that the MR\u20101 mRNA and protein expression were greatly decreased. Furthermore, compared with the angiotensin II\u2010treated group, the MR\u20101 RNAi + Ang II group showed a decrease in the surface area of cells by 36% [87]. In another study, it is reported that the translocation of the hypertrophic transcription factor, NF\u2010AT, to the nucleus of the cardiomyocyte and the enhancement of NF\u2010AT transcriptional activity induced by angiotensin II could be prevented by 17b\u2010estradiol [88]. Angiotensin II also stimulated the activation of protein kinase C, contributing to cardiac hypertrophy. 17b\u2010estradiol inhibited these pathways, related to the stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide production and secretion. These observations were further supported by the evidence that siRNA against the MCIP1 gene significantly reversed both the 17b\u2010estradiol restraint of protein synthesis and the inhibition of angiotensin II\u2010induced calcineurin activity. Accordingly, their findings may provide a better understanding of the mechanism of cardiac remodeling and new insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies in cardiac hypertrophy.",

If genes responsible for affective disorders are identified, gene silencing could be an alternative therapeutic tool, especially for cases of drug therapy resistance. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) has been identified as the most common causal agent of viral myocarditis, but existing drug therapies are of limited value [90]. Many studies have shown that RNAi can control viral infection by targeting viral genes. Recently, Schubert et al. found that two independent siRNA targeting the 3D RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase were able to reduce virus titer by 80% and 90%, respectively [91]. Their results demonstrate the enormous potential of the RNAi approach. An siRNA double\u2010expression vector (SiDEx) is constructed to achieve simultaneous expression of both siRNA from one plasmid [91]. Compared with conventional expression vectors, SiDEx showed substantial gene regulation of the mutated target RNA. Hence it is believed that SiDEx may be a helpful tool to achieve sustained silencing of viruses, ultimately reducing the risk of emergence of viable mutants. Yuan et al. reported that the siRNA targeting the viral protease 2A displayed a 92% inhibition of CVB3 replication and a 90% protection of the siRNA\u2010pretreated cells in HeLa cells and murine cardiomyocytes [92]. Moreover, they found that administration of the siRNA after viral infection could effectively inhibit CVB3 replication, indicating its therapeutic potential.

One of the important features of heart failure is a decreased Ca2+ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+\u2010ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which is negatively regulated by phospholamban (PLB), a key regulator of cardiac calcium homeostasis [93]. Recent findings demonstrated that the development of severe heart failure in the genetic muscle LIM protein (MLP) (\u2212/\u2212) animal model could be abolished completely by the targeted ablation of PLB. PLB has been considered as the potential therapeutic target for the improvement of SR Ca2+ uptake and cardiac function. Twenty\u2010one nucleotide\u2013siRNA duplexes with symmetric 2\u2010nucleotide 3\u2032\u2010overhangs targeting PLB mRNA were synthesized and introduced into neonatal rat cardiac myocytes by the use of the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) envelope vector [94]. It was found that PLB siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of both PLB mRNA and protein, while the mRNA and protein of SERCA2 calsequestrin were not affected. The affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+ was also increased. In order to determine the effect of PLB RNAi on the cardiac myocytes in which Ca2+ handling was impaired, the myocytes were exposed to H2O2, a reactive oxygen species. The same result with decreased PLB mRNA and protein levels was achieved. So Watanabe\u2019s strategy used for the PLB ablation may be considered as a novel and attractive candidate for clinical therapy in heart failure. \nTable II\n summarizes application and target genes of siRNA for CVDs.",

The age of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) \u2013 the major muscular dystrophy in children, with a mean death age of 25.3 years \u2013 can be shortened further because of cardiomyopathy complications [95]. DMD is associated with mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes key components of a muscle complex comprising transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins. A number of these proteins have orthologues in C. elegans [96]. RNAi knockdown of the conserved orthologues resulted in phenotypes similar to that seen in dystrophin gene\u20101. RNAi can be applied in the context of a positive transgenic background to provide bidirectional control of gene expression. For instance, a protein\u2010coding gene and an shRNA directed against that gene, each under the control of different inducible promoters, can be transfected into the same cell. This approach has been applied to C. elegans to enable bidirectional control of transmembrane calcium flux in an attempt to unravel the poorly understood involvement of elevated intracellular calcium in DMD [97]. egl\u201019 is a C. elegans calcium channel, the gain\u2010of\u2010function mutation of which was used to enhance the signal and RNAi knockdown of egl\u201019 to diminish it. Enhancing the calcium signal resulted in enhanced muscle degeneration, and this was blocked by RNAi knockdown of egl\u201019 [97]. Thus, there is considerable potential for the application of RNAi to worm and fly models of this disease. In humans, the X\u2010linked form of Emery\u2010Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is caused by the loss of function of emerin, a nuclear membrane LEM\u2010domain protein. Emerin is a member of the lamin class of proteins that form networks of filaments in the inner nuclear envelope and are essential for maintaining nuclear shape, DNA replication and transcription [98]. Although the C. elegans equivalent of emerin, EMR\u20101, is homologous to its vertebrate counterpart, RNAi knockdown of emr\u20101 produced no detectable phenotype in C. elegans at any stage of development [99]. This suggested that functional loss of EMR\u20101 was being compensated for by another pathway. To test the hypothesis that EMR\u20101 overlaps functionally with the structurally similar MAN\u20101, for which no function was known, it was established that RNAi knockdown of MAN\u20101 alone was lethal in 15% of embryos, but MAN\u20101 knockdown in the absence of EMR\u20101 was lethal to all embryos [100]. Thus, applying RNAi approaches using the worm model suggests that EMR\u20101 and MAN\u20101 overlap functionally, raising hopes for a gene replacement strategy as a therapy for Emery\u2010Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.",

Knockdown of the worm SMN protein using RNAi results in poor embryonic viability and severely uncoordinated locomotion [98]. It is suggested that some C. elegans SMN protein interactions are similar to those of human equivalents [98]. Drosophila has an orthologue of SMN (dSMN) [102] and has been used as a model of this disease. A Drosophila SMN gene point mutation results in a phenotype that includes abnormal motor behavior, functionally impaired neurons and altered synaptic transmission [102]. RNAi suppression of SMN in Drosophila S2 cells resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis [103] through a pathway involving the caspases DRONC and DRICE.

Plaque deposition is a result of overproduction of A\u03b2 through the activity of \u03b3\u2010secretase, of which the presenilins are thought to be a component. C. elegans model was used in microarray studies to identify the genes upregulated and downregulated as a result of the heterologous expression of A\u03b2 [104], and should also prove useful in global RNAi approaches designed to identify genes regulating the secretion of A\u03b2. In the worm AD model, the A\u03b2 is expressed only in muscle. Clearly, there is a need for improved invertebrate models of AD, particularly for a C. elegans model in which human Ab is expressed in neurons and is secreted. A Drosophila model of AD has been generated that expresses the amyloid precursor protein (APP) [105], but it is not known if the APP is processed into A\u03b2. More recent models of AD have been reported in which A\u03b2 is expressed in the CNS, resulting in neurodegeneration and shortened lifespan [106, 107]. These models offer exciting possibilities for RNAi\u2010based studies. However, RNAi applied to Drosophila cell lines is a potentially powerful alternative approach in determining the pathways involved in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, as the Drosophila equivalent to human presenilins PS1 and PS2 (PSN) appears to be involved in pathways similar to its vertebrate counterparts [108]. Early\u2010onset familial Alzheimer\u2019s, for example, is associated with mutations in presenilin genes PS1 and PS2 which lead to oversecretion of A\u03b2. RNAi knockdown of PSN results in a blockage of \u03b3\u2010secretase activity [108], providing confirmation of this gene\u2019s role in the \u03b3\u2010secretase pathway. Another study [109] used RNAi to reduce expression of two genes, aph\u20101 and pen\u20102, in Drosophila S2 cells. Knockdown of these genes resulted in reduced proteolytic cleavage of A\u03b2 precursor protein and Notch substrates and reduced production of processed presenilin, suggesting that they are required for the action of, and the accumulation of, the \u03b3\u2010secretase. The increased levels of A\u03b2 in AD caused by the \u03b3\u2010secretase is thought to be counteracted by \u03b1\u2010secretases that cleave the precursor protein in the middle. The identity of the \u03b1\u2010secretase is uncertain, but a recent study [110] showed that RNAi knockdown of each of three ADAM (\u03b1 disintegrin and metalloprotease) proteins, ADAM9, ADAM10 and ADAM17, in human glioblastoma A172 cells, which have elevated endogenous \u03b1\u2010secretase, indicates that all three of these proteins are involved in the \u03b1\u2010secretase activity. An extension of this approach in mammalian systems will also enable potential gene targets for therapeutic intervention to be identified. For example, siRNAs targeting the \u03b2\u2010secretase, \u03b2\u2010site of APP cleaving enzyme, were shown to reduce APP production in mouse cortical neurons, offering a potential therapeutic approach for AD [111].",

RNAi has recently been performed on two prevalent poly(Q) diseases, Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). HD is an autosomal dominant hereditary brain disorder that is progressive and fatal. Mutations in the Huntingtin gene result in involuntary movement (chorea), cognitive impairment and psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety [112]. HD is caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in exon\u20101 of the Huntingtin gene. This expansion elongates the N\u2010terminal poly(Q) stretch of the protein, resulting in aggregation and the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions. A number of treatment strategies have been proposed that target Huntingtin proteolysis, aggregation and transcription [113]. SBMA is an X\u2010linked motor neuron disease that occurs in adulthood [114]. This progressive disease results in the loss of motor neurons in the lower spinal cord and the brain stem and is caused by CAG trinucleotide expansion in the first exon of androgen receptor (AR). Unaffected individuals have between 11 and 35 poly(Q) repeats as opposed to 38 and 62 repeats in SBMA individuals [115]. This poly(Q) expansion results in intranuclear aggregate formation in tissues where the AR gene is normally expressed. One laboratory [116] synthesized transgenic strains that expressed poly(Q35) expansion fused with yellow fluorescent protein and used it in a global RNAi screen. This screen identified 186 genes that resulted in premature appearance of protein aggregates. The genes identified are mainly involved in RNA metabolism, protein synthesis, protein folding, protein degradation and protein trafficking. It would be interesting to see whether the same genes control other protein aggregation diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s. Drosophila S2 cells were engineered to express a portion of human AR gene with CAG tracts of 26, 43 or 106 repeats tagged by green fluorescent protein [116]. Cells carrying the CAG repeats of 43 and 106 developed green fluorescent protein aggregates and aggresomes, with 106 aggregates being formed much faster than 43 CAG repeats. Using RNAi directed against AR protein, Caplen et al. showed loss of AR green fluorescent protein aggregates by 80% in co\u2010transfected S2 cells [117].

Recently, this approach has been used in combination with overexpression studies to explore the role of Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in dopamine neuron degeneration in Drosophila. Overexpression of Parkin was shown to degrade its substrate (Pael\u2010R) and suppress its toxicity, whereas interfering with endogenous Parkin promoted substrate accumulation and augmented its neurotoxicity [118]. Viral\u2010mediated RNAi has been used [119] to block dopamine synthesis in mid\u2010brain neurons of adult mice. This study used an adeno\u2010associated virus vector in which a U6 promoter drove the expression of shRNA directed against tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme required for the production of dopamine. This was injected stereotactically into the substantia nigra of one side of the brain and a similar vector promoting the expression of a randomized shRNA injected into the other side. GFP expression was observed in both halves of the brain, but dopamine staining was reduced only in the side of the brain into which the anti\u2010tyrosine hydroxylase shRNA had been injected.

Miller and co\u2010workers were able to generate siRNAs that selectively reduced expression of either the mutant or the normal allele, depending on the specific nucleotide present at this site in the complementary guide strand and the targeted mRNA [110]. Some researchers have performed studies aimed at determining whether RNAi could be used to target the pathogenic process in inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine expansions [117]. They used Drosophila and human tissue culture models of spinobulbar muscular atrophy, a disease caused by CAG expansions in the gene encoding the androgen receptor. They assessed the abilities of different siRNAs to selectively inhibit expression of transcripts that included a truncated human androgen receptor gene containing different CAG repeat lengths (16\u2013112 repeats). They found that RNA duplexes containing CAG repeat tracts only induced gene\u2010specific inhibition when flanking androgen receptor sequences were included.

An siRNA that efficiently inhibits the mRNA of the purinergic P2X3 receptor was generated [122]. Dorn et al. have reported that RNAi can block a pathophysiological pain response and provide relief from neuropathic pain in a rat disease model [123]. Rats, intrathecally infused with a 21\u2010nucleotide siRNA, showed diminished pain responses compared with missense (MS) siRNA\u2010treated and \u2010untreated controls in models of both agonist\u2010evoked pain and chronic neuropathic pain [123].

Levels of Raf\u20101 and Bcl\u20102 proteins were markedly decreased in each of the transfected cell lines; combined RNAi for c\u2010raf and bcl\u20102 induced apoptosis in HL\u201060, U937, and THP\u20101 cells and increased their sensitivity to the DNA\u2010damaging agent etoposide. Activation of TNF receptors and related death receptors can induce death of some cancer cells, but may simultaneously activate pathways that promote cell survival; one protein that inhibits the TNF cell death pathway is called FLIP [FADD\u2010like IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010converting enzyme (FLICE)\u2010like inhibitory protein]. When FLIP expression was suppressed in cancer cells using siRNAs, the cells were more sensitive to being killed when death receptors were activated [140]. Several other studies have demonstrated efficacy of liposome\u2010 or viral vector\u2010mediated transfection of cancer cells in suppressing their growth and/or inducing their death [141]. The next step in the development of RNAi technology for cancer therapy will be to establish methods for targeting tumor cells in vivo. Another approach might be to target genes that promote angiogenesis. Tumor cells require a rich supply of blood and achieve this by stimulating the process of angiogenesis; it may therefore be possible to inhibit tumor growth by targeting the vascular endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis. As evidence, it was shown that depletion of the crk adaptor protein using RNAi inhibited the migration of cultured vascular endothelial cells [142]. In another study, changes in cell shape, reduction in clonogenicity, and an increased susceptibility to transforming growth factor (TGF)b1/vitamin D3\u2010induced differentiation were noted when AML1/MTG8 expression was inhibited using siRNA. Elucidating the role of AML1/MTG8 in preventing differentiation is an example of how targeting fusion genes that result in oncoproteins has become a novel and exciting approach towards killing tumor cells [143]. Further applications of RNAi in the field of tumor therapy have targeted the commonly mutated Ras oncogene after phase I/II studies with antisense DNA oligonucleotides have failed. Ras genes are frequently mutated in human cancers, making it a difficult oncogene to target [144, 145]. Brummelkamp et al. report success inhibiting K\u2010RAS (Kirsten\u2010rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene) expression in human pancreatic carcinoma cells using an RNAi retroviral system which led to the loss of anchorage\u2010independent growth and tumorgenicity [145]. Furthermore, selective inhibition of mutant K\u2010RAS and not wild\u2010type exemplifies the specificity of RNAi and its potential in gene therapy. Complementary to studies on Ras, recent RNAi\u2010related studies on the tumor\u2010suppressor gene promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene have revealed no regulatory relationship between PML and major histocompatibility (MHC) class I expression. By inhibiting PML, the proposed downregulation of MHC class I was not seen suggesting an alternative method employed by acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to evade the host immune system [146]. Viral oncogenes are another potential target for RNAi\u2010mediated tumor therapy. Selectively inhibiting cells that are infected with cancer\u2010causing viruses has been shown to be effective through study of human papilloma virus (HPV)\u2010positive human cervical carcinoma cells [147]. It is known that defects in repair of DNA double\u2010strand breaks make cells hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. Protein kinase, DNA\u2010activated, catalytic polypeptide (Prkdc) is a gene that encodes for the catalytic subunit of the DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase DNA\u2010Pkcs which is integral to DNA repair. Peng et al. used RNAi to target Prkdc in human fibroblasts and found that radiosensitivity was increased [148]. RNAi is also being used to study transcription factors implicated in aberrant signaling pathways responsible for oncologic disease. An example is the successful RNAi\u2010mediated inhibition of the nuclear transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein, which has been implicated to have a role in leukemogenesis by virtue of its overexpression in the bone marrow of patients with active leukemia [149].",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency viral infection, a dreaded disease, requires attention as therapeutic drugs are not available to treat it. HIV was the first infectious agent targeted by RNAi, perhaps because the life cycle and pattern of gene expression of HIV is well understood [150]. HIV messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and the viral genome are known, which can be degraded by RNA interference [151, 152, 153]. Novina et al. targeted the HIV gag gene, which is expressed during the later stages of HIV replication and encodes the Gag precursor protein that is proteolytically cleaved into p24 and other polypeptides; p24 forms the core of HIV and functions in uncoating and packaging of viral RNA. When cells transfected with anti\u2010gag siRNA were exposed to HIV, in vitro production of p24 decreased [154]. An important finding was that anti\u2010gag siRNA also inhibited the production of p24 in cells with stably integrated provirus. Despite the success of RNAi\u2010mediated inhibition of HIV\u2010encoded RNAs in cell culture, targeting the virus directly represents a substantial challenge for clinical applications because the high viral mutation rate will lead to mutants that can escape being targeted [154]. Therefore RNAi\u2010mediated downregulation of the cellular cofactors required for HIV infection is an attractive alternative or complementary approach. After transfection of cultured T cells with siRNA against the mRNA for CD4, the principal HIV receptor [155, 156], expression of CD4 on the surface of most cells was diminished and HIV production after exposure of the cells to the virus decreased substantially [153]. Coreceptor chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is another logical target for RNA interference, as homozygous mutations in the gene for this receptor have no deleterious effects on immune function yet confer a high level of resistance against HIV infection [157, 158]. Some researchers have also successfully blocked HIV entry by targeting HIV\u20101 CCR5 in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes [159]. They used a lentiviral vector to transduce an anti\u2010CCR5 shRNA in human lymphocytes. Downregulation of CCR5 resulted in a modest, but nevertheless significant three\u2010 to sevenfold reduction in viral infectivity relative to controls. Inhibition of HIV\u20101 replication has been successful with siRNA against the HIV\u20101 tat protein [160]. Other HIV proteins targeted by siRNA include the non\u2010structural protein rev and gag genes. This may have the potential to manipulate stem cells that are virus\u2010resistant for autologous transplantation [161].",

            "text": "Diseases caused by viruses and bacteria continue to be major causes of death worldwide and are an increasing cause of concern because of the emergence of resistant strains and the potential use of infectious pathogens by terrorists [162, 163]. Respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus are additional targets of RNAi\u2010mediated inhibition with initial success in mammalian cell culture [164]. In children, both viruses are responsible for a significant proportion of acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis, respectively. The influenza virus has been another recent target of RNAi as siRNA against influenza nucleocapsid and RNA transcriptase leads to inhibition of replication and blockade of other viral RNAs. This suggests the possible role for siRNAs in influenza prophylaxis and therapy [165] to be a very efficient and convenient approach. Plasmodium falciparum is an important pathogen in third world countries where it is endemic. Malhotra et al. applied RNAi technology against two cystiene protease genes falcipain\u20101 and \u20102 as a possible approach to treat malaria [166]. Introduction of falciparum dsRNA produced morphologic changes in the food vacuoles of these parasites and also inhibited requisite hemoglobin degradation. These effects have helped investigators create a model for the pathogenesis of malaria. Another exciting application of RNAi has been the targeting of the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. With its propensity to modify exogenous DNA and high frequency of non\u2010homologous recombination, gene replacement has been a challenge in C. neoformans. RNAi has proven to be a valuable tool for probing function of gene products potentially involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus. Using the capsular gene 59 (CAP59) and ADE2 (adenylosuccinate synthetase2) genes as initial targets, investigators have shown that RNAi works in fungus and can now apply this technology to study gene function, taking advantage of the rapidly accumulating genome sequence of C. neoformans [167].",

In vivo application of siRNA against genes of HBV also led to an effective inhibition of virus replication [168]. Subgenomic and full\u2010length HCV replicons that replicate and express HCV proteins in stably transfected human hepatoma\u2010derived Huh\u20107 cells have been used to study the effects of various antiviral drugs [169, 170, 171, 172]. siRNAs targeting the internal ribosome entry site or mRNAs encoding the viral non\u2010structural proteins NS3 and NS5B inhibited HCV replicon function in cell culture [173]. Furthermore, anti\u2010HCV siRNAs depleted Huh\u20107 cells of persistently replicating HCV replicons [174]. McCaffrey et al. performed hydrodynamic tail\u2010vein injections of siRNAs or anti\u2010HCV shRNAs to direct efficient cleavage of HCV sequences in an HCV\u2010luciferase fusion construct in mouse hepatocytes in vivo [168]. Using this method, the silencing of either Fas receptor [66] or caspase\u20108 [175] resulted in a clearly measurable protection from severe Fas\u2010induced liver damage. Anti\u2010Fas siRNAs were hydrodynamically injected into the antibody\u2010treated mice: 82% of the mice survived for 10 days of observation whereas all control mice died within 3 days [67].",

By using angiotensin II as a model system, it has been found that a rapid and transient activation of endothelial NAD(P)H oxidases precedes H2O2\u2010dependent downregulation of DHFR and eNOS uncoupling in the endothelium. This signaling cascade may represent a universal mechanism whereby eNOS uncouples under conditions associated with oxidant stress, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes, for which activation of vascular NAD(P)H oxidases has been documented. Specific inhibition of endothelial DHFR through RNA interference (RNAi) led to a marked reduction in endothelial H4B and NO\u02d9 bioavailability [176]. Evidence has confirmed that Fas\u2010induced apoptosis can enlarge infarct size during reperfusion of ischemic tissue in multiple tissues such as the heart [177], kidney and brain.

Ongoing research worldwide has provided valuable clues regarding the precise mechanism of siRNA and therefore, siRNA have multi\u2010faceted roles to play in the management of various disorders. Currently, there are many diseases like myocarditis, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, HIV, etc. which are incurable. Conventional drugs provide only symptomatic relief as they are not able to modulate the cellular aberrations. With the advancements in understanding the altered cellular mechanism as well as the gene functioning in various pathological states, targeting these cellular components appears to be more promising. It may serve to be a breakthrough alternative molecular strategy for the treatment. Moreover, various approaches are being designed for the delivery of siRNAs including chemical modification, and viral\u2010 and non\u2010viral\u2010mediated delivery. Furthermore, apparently, the initial cost for development of this treatment option may seem to be high, but once developed may reduce the overall cost of disease therapy as well as the cost for the remission.
