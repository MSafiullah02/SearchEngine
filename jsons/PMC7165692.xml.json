Accumulating evidence, mostly from office buildings, suggests that lower ventilation rates (VRs) in buildings are associated with increases in a variety of adverse health effects, such as infectious disease, acute symptoms, and impaired cognition or performance (Li et al., 2007; Seppanen et al., 1999; Sundell et al., 2011). However, this evidence is still limited, especially for schools. School\u2010age children spend more time in school than in any other indoor environment except the home (Klepeis et al., 1996). It is clear that a substantial proportion of current classrooms do not provide even the minimum rates of ventilation specified in standards (Daisey et al., 2003). It is important to determine whether classroom VRs influence students' health, as input for future classroom ventilation standards: could minimum allowed VRs be lowered safely to save energy, or should they be kept the same or even raised to protect student health?",

Limited evidence suggests that lower VRs in offices, schools, and dormitory rooms are associated with increased illness absence (Seppanen et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2011). Only one available study provides information on classroom VRs and the health of students as indicated by school absences. Shendell et al. (2004) reported that higher classroom ventilation rates were associated with a substantial reduction in student absence. Their study, however, used simple measurements \u2013 short, one\u2010time measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in each classroom to estimate VRs throughout a school year, and an outcome of total absence, including illness absence, but also other types of absence unlikely to be influenced by VR.",

The sensors transmitted data to the manufacturer for two years, as 5\u2010min averaged values of CO2 concentration (in parts per million, ppm), temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit, \u00b0F), and relative humidity (in %). The nondispersive infrared CO2 sensors had a resolution of 10 ppm, with accuracy (based on calibration by the manufacturer) of the larger of 5% or 100 ppm within the range 0\u20132000 ppm, and typically 5% within the range 2000\u20135000 ppm. The sensors also used a daily autocalibration process to prevent drift and maintain calibration over time (details provided in Data S2). Custom\u2010built protective housings were provided to protect CO2 sensors located outdoors from excessive moisture. Our computer server downloaded data from the PureChoice server daily for two years. If study sensors became inoperable for various periods or permanently during the study, they were restarted or replaced when feasible. Missing sensor data were not estimated. We excluded from VR calculations all so\u2010called \u2018minimum\u2019 days in each school (short instruction days of \u00bd to 2/3 the length of normal school days), as peak indoor CO2 on these days was less likely to reach true equilibrium levels.",

The corresponding outside CO2 concentration, originally planned to be the 60\u2010min outdoor averaged CO2 for the period ending at the midpoint of the selected 15\u2010min indoor period, was, due to errors in outdoor readings, estimated in analyses as 400 ppm across all schools.

Peak indoor CO2 levels between 600 ppm and 7000 ppm were considered plausible for equilibrium levels in occupied classrooms during a school day. Because the CO2 sensors outdoors turned out to be unstable, with many implausibly high or low values, we excluded all outdoor measurement data and estimated outdoor CO2 concentrations at 400 ppm, a value from a prior survey that included CO2 outside of California classrooms (Whitmore et al., 2003).",

In analytical models at the classroom\u2010day level, we estimated the relative change in absence per each 1 l/s\u2010person change in VR. The outcome was illness absence count on each classroom day. Including illness absence counts per classroom as the outcome with a covariate of total enrollment per classroom was equivalent to analyzing for proportion of illness absence. Averaged VR period was the primary exposure: one model each for 3\u2010, 7\u2010, 14\u2010, and 21\u2010day exposure periods. We used zero\u2010inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models, because counts of daily illness absence in classrooms were highly skewed, with many 0 values (Yau et al., 2003). ZINB models contain two components: a zero inflated (ZI) model to estimate the probability of each observation to be nonzero and a negative binomial (NB) model to estimate the values of those observations with a nonzero probability of being positive. We constructed 16 models: for four samples (each of the three school districts and all districts combined), separately for each of the four VR metrics. We estimated the uncertainty (variance) of the estimated coefficients using a bootstrap, resampling the schools within districts, in order to reflect the underlying clustered structure of the data. Models were clustered on schools, which were chosen as clusters because classrooms had much more variability within than schools.",

These same covariates were included in all (separate and combined district) NB component models: day of the week, grade level, class enrollment, proportion in school lunch program, and proportion male. For details regarding inclusion of specific potential covariates, see Data S3 and Figure S1. To avoid the problem of modeling high proportions of zero values for single\u2010day illness absence, we also constructed an alternate set of NB models containing single\u2010day VR values and different multiple\u2010day averages for IA counts: 7\u2010day or 21\u2010day averaged IA.",

Adjusted estimates (Table 4) were very similar to unadjusted estimates. The model assumes a nonlinear relationship in which the relative change per VR unit stays constant, but the absolute change decreases as VR increases. The adjusted estimates (coefficients) for VR in the ZINB model indicate that if a classroom were to increase its VR by 1 l/s\u2010person while holding all other variables in the model constant, the expected proportion of illness absence would be multiplied by a factor equal to the coefficient. Coefficients less than 1.0 indicate decreased illness absence.

This, especially when sensors could not be restarted or replaced, resulted in substantial data loss, compensated for by extension of the study past the original dates. These problems, mostly solved by midstudy, caused loss of power, but probably not systematic bias. There were also some implausibly low values in recorded CO2 levels, presumably due to calibration drift. While the sensors performed daily self\u2010recalibration, this failed to prevent all implausible values and also prevented post\u2010calibration correction. We excluded implausible indoor CO2 values from analyses (ranging across districts from 0.3 to 6.1% of classroom days, essentially all with indoor CO2 concentrations <600 ppm); any remaining errors from calibration drift would have caused nondifferential misclassification. The CO2 sensors, not designed or previously used for outdoors due to moisture sensitivity, were installed outdoors in custom\u2010built cases for protection against excess moisture. Still, because their data proved unusably erratic (values up to 1400 ppm, instead of the expected 380\u2013600), we estimated all outdoor CO2 values at 400 ppm for calculating \u0394CO2 values. If the 400 ppm outdoor estimate used were to have generally underestimated urban outdoor CO2, this would have led to underestimated VRs and to exaggerated proportions of VRs less than current guidelines, but not to changed significance of associations with IA. Random errors in outdoor CO2 estimations would have biased model estimates toward the null. Additional details on problems with sensor data are provided in Data S2.",

Identifying true indoor equilibrium CO2 levels is challenging in analysis of large amounts of such data. If true equilibrium levels are not reached during a school day, which is very possible in classrooms, measured peak values will underestimate equilibrium levels and overestimate actual VRs. If occupants breathed directly on sensors, peak recorded levels would overestimate true equilibrium concentrations; we reduced likelihood of this by basing VR estimation on peak 15\u2010min moving averages in each classroom. Also, although we estimated a fixed VR per day per classroom, ventilation may vary throughout the day in classrooms, as from window openings in naturally ventilated classrooms in warm climates such as SC. Thus, VR estimates in the naturally ventilated SC classrooms may have had more error than those in the air\u2010conditioned CV classrooms; however, because SC had more data, less precision in the estimates of effect was not evident.",

Higher temperatures would increase VRs in the SC classrooms because of window opening; however, they would reduce VRs in the air\u2010conditioned Central Valley classrooms because of window closing. Despite this opposite effect, relationships between VR and illness absence were similar across these two districts/climate regions. It is also possible that higher temperatures in some classrooms during hot weather, more likely in non\u2010air\u2010conditioned rooms as in the SC district, adversely affected thermal comfort and thus reduced school performance, and in turn increased reported illness absence in these classrooms, compared with air\u2010conditioned classrooms.
