Rhinovirus was the most common virus detected overall. Asymptomatic viral infection was associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, bocavirus, enterovirus, and single virus detection. Importantly, asymptomatic viral infection did not lead to AOM development. To our knowledge, this is the largest series describing asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in infants (n = 403). Because viruses are intracellular microorganisms, detection of viruses in clinical specimens suggest replication of viruses in the host cells; thus, the term \"infection\" is appropriate regardless of symptoms. We defined \"asymptomatic infection\" by a 7-day symptom-free period before and after specimen collection; this history was carefully obtained from both parents and medical record review. This study is unique in that we utilized longitudinal data from the same infant to distinguish a new infection from repeated detection due to prolonged presence of virus nucleic acid in the respiratory tract. We used a 30-day time frame to separate the 2 situations for uniformity with previous reports [14, 15] . We are aware that survival of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract may vary depending on the virus species identified [15, 16] . Therefore, some of the defined asymptomatic viral infections in this study could still be from prolonged presence (>30 days) of viral nucleic acids in the respiratory tract. To ascertain \"new\" viral infection in a successive series of positive detections of the same virus over time, sequencing of the detected viruses will be required but is beyond the scope of this report. We found that URTI symptoms in infants associated with numerous host and virus factors and many of these factors were interrelated. Interestingly, URTI symptoms in the first year of life associated with increasing age (eg, infants 6-12 months of age expressed more symptoms than younger infants). Consistent with our finding, studies of older children [8, 17, 18] found that the ages of 6-12 months were a risk factor for symptoms. Collectively, these data indicate that 6-to 12-month-old infants are more likely to express symptoms than younger infants or older children. It is well known that young infants express less specific symptoms when they are ill and they are less susceptible to infections due to preexisting maternal antibodies, which wane with age. Older infants had more frequent single and multiple virus detection. Increased exposure to infections in older infants likely increases infection by multiple viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1288, "end": 1292, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1296, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1422, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1426, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2160, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2164, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2168, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This may also contribute to symptom expression in older infants; association of multiple viral infections and symptoms/ severity has previously been documented [8, 19, 20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 163, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In this report focusing on URTI (but not LRTI), we found rhinovirus to be the most commonly detected virus in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infants. Miller et al [21] recently reported similar findings in 175 URTI episodes in infants (<12 months) over 4 consecutive years. Our study also showed positive correlations between rhinovirus, symptoms, and AOM development. Other viruses highly associated with symptoms included RSV, influenza, and metapneumovirus; the seasonality of these 3 viruses may explain the higher rate of symptomatic infection during winter respiratory season and higher rate of asymptomatic infection from April to August. A recent casecontrol study performed in Sweden in children aged <5 years during non-influenza season also showed high proportion of RSV and metapneumovirus in symptomatic cases [22] . Prolonged presence of bocavirus may partially explain a lack of association between symptoms and this virus detection [23] . AOM occurs mostly as a bacterial complication of viral URTI. Our finding that asymptomatic viral infection did not lead to AOM highlights the fact that a necessary step in the pathogenesis of AOM is an inflammation of the nasopharynx and the Eustachian tubes severe enough to cause URTI symptoms and associated Eustachian tube dysfunction. We clearly showed a strong correlation between expression of URTI symptoms and high viral load for all viruses except for influenza, which only accounted for a small number. Others have also shown the correlation between viral load and symptom severity of specific viruses [23] [24] [25] [26] . It is interesting that the development of AOM was not associated with a higher viral load during URTI. In previous studies of an older cohort, we have also shown a lack of association between AOM complication and high viral load in metapneumovirus and bocavirus URTI [27, 28] . It is possible that viral load has lesser importance on the development of AOM when considered along with other known AOM risk factors such as demographic and genetic risks, feeding status, daycare attendance, nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization, pneumococcal antibody status, and type of URTI virus [2, 12, 29, 30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 826, "end": 830, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1575, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1580, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1585, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1590, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1864, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1868, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2176, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2180, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2184, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2188, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, this large study of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in the first year of life showed rhinovirus to be the most commonly detected virus.
