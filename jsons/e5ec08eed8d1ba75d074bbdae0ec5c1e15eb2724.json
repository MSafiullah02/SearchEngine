Interestingly, similar age (approximately 30 days) of affected broilers was described from these reported infections and in our study. Given that most of the broiler chickens are maintained at a high density in Taiwan or other countries where commercial broiler operations are practiced, viral variants seem more likely to emerge from IBVs that co-circulate in the farm during the breeding period. Therefore, in addition to the regular immunization, improved management and biosecurity practices may help reduce the viral emergence and control the disease outbreaks.In contrast to other variants, the 3382/06, a recombinant IBV whose S1 protein belongs to the TW-I, did not show lethality and oviduct tropism. The mild clinical symptoms and low virulence in chickens caused by the 3382/06 can be speculated that the recombination with the H120 vaccine strain attenuated the pathogenicity.However, to what extent the swapped genes influenced the viral virulence remains unknown. Similarly, although we have examined the structural protein genes (S to N), the link of sequence variations in other non-structural protein genes to serotype changes observed from IBV S78/14 and 2992/02 in this study is not clear. More studies based on the reverse genetic techniques are needed to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the altered antigenicity and virulence of a variant carrying chimeric IBV genome arrangement. The Mass lineage virus is the current industry standard vaccine strain for IBV control. Our results from the protection experiments pointed out that chickens immunized with H120 virus failed to eliminate viral shedding after infection with the three recombinant strains. Furthermore, these viruses produced appreciable pathogenic effects in the immunized chickens, indicating that H120 is not competent as the sole immunogen to defeat current circulating recombinant IBVs. New vaccines conferring desirable cross-protection are warranted.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
