There is significant evidence to demonstrate that protein-energy malnutrition from 16 inadequate dietary intake can increase risk of infectious diseases. 1 Reciprocally, any exposure, 17 including infectious disease, that impairs immune function and causes malabsorption, increased 18 catabolism, or decreased nutrient intake can increase risk of malnutrition. Exploratory studies 19 indicate that patients infected with Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) experience some 20 or any of the following symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion, 21 headache, sore throat, chest pain, pneumonia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and loss of taste and smell, all of which may influence nutrition status, and, ultimately immune function. 2,3 The 23 term malnutrition is most simply defined as imbalanced intake of protein and/or energy over 24 prolonged periods of time and can occur in bot underweight and overweight. 4 The current 25 document provides guidance that primarily focused on protein-energy malnutrition, which can 26 result from inadequate intake, increased requirements, impaired absorption, and/or altered 27 nutrient utilization. 5",

For example, while nurses or other team 70 members may have conducted nutrition screening prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the 71 pandemic, these professionals may be needed for emergency patient care and may not be able to 72 perform malnutrition screening. In these cases, the nutrition team could carry out the screening 73 process so that patients who are at risk for malnutrition can receive appropriate nutrition 74 assessment and intervention without delay. Also, special coordination, such as conducting 75 nutrition screening using patient room telephones, can be considered to minimize staff exposure.

Children with food insecurity are at 347 increased risk for poor health, asthma, obesity, anemia, developmental problems, behavioral348 problems and aggression and anxiety. 33,34 349 Currently, there have been no major food shortages reported in the US related to the COVID-19 350 pandemic. 35 However, unemployment rates have soared, 36 causing unprecedented demand for 351 unemployment benefits and several initiatives to reduce the burden of monthly payments for 352 rent, utilities, or home or student loans. Despite these measures, many individuals are struggling 353 economically, which may decrease accessibility of fresh and healthy foods. Social isolation 354 measures implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection may also increase risk for 355 food insecurity. For example, in the United States, 29.7 million children 37 depend on free lunches 356 from the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, but during the current COVID-19 357 pandemic, many schools have closed, and clients may be uncertain how to access free meals 358 being provided by schools. Uncertainty of how to access food assistance programs may increase 359 the daily financial burden on low-income families to provide healthy meals. In addition, 360 individuals who are at high risk of severe symptoms and mortality from COVID-19 infection, 361 including individuals who are elderly, may be wary of shopping at the grocery store or may want 362 to avoid public transportation to the grocery store. RDNs working in the community, outpatient, 363 and hospital settings have a crucial responsibility to identify clients' food access needs and 364 provide federal, state, and local resources to help address these needs. 365 366 When appropriate, RDNs should screen for food insecurity, provide guidance and 367 resources for eating healthfully on a budget, and provide resources to improve access to 368 healthy foods. 369 370 When working with individuals with or at risk of malnutrition due to food insecurity during the 371 COVID-19 pandemic, RDNs should consider the following: It may be advantageous to screen for food insecurity. Validated tools include the 2-item 373 Hunger Vital Sign tool as well as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) RDNs can counsel individuals and their families to focus on healthful food choices by 376 providing thrifty meal options with grocery lists and recipes. RDNs can additionally 377 encourage families to reduce their grocery bills by brainstorming methods to decrease 378 food waste. 41-44 379 \u2022 If possible, RDNs may be able to consult with clients directly in their homes via 380 telehealth. Remote sessions can be an opportunity to reach clients when they are near 381 their cupboards and refrigerators, which may be an effective method of collaborating on 382 dietary changes in real time and place. The Academy provides resources to provide 383 nutrition resources via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. 45-48 RDNs should ask 384 clients which communication methods they prefer.
