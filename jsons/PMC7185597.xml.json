This chapter deals with different challenges which may be in addition to those or in isolation and which arise from other demands made upon the anaesthetist or intensivist as a result of religious or other firmly held beliefs, or other pressures which impact on the clinician. These other stresses could affect the normal clinical practice of that clinician, the care provided or the attitude to that care. Some of these pressures are avoidable; some are present but may be unrecognised. This chapter will attempt to highlight some of these pressures and how they can be understood, approached and managed both ethically and clinically.",

            "text": "Individuals have different values. They prioritise their values in different ways. Patients who challenge make choices which are perceived by many to be either irrational or against a person's interests, such as engaging in harmful or excessively risky activities. When the medical profession is involved in such choices, the basic medical principle of acting in a person's best interests is challenged. Often doctors refuse to respect controversial choices on paternalistic grounds. We should all respect and facilitate the patients who challenge and the choices of competent individuals, subject to resource limitations, our own and others well-being and autonomy, and the public interest. But more importantly, sometimes such choices make for a better, more autonomous life. Sometimes, such choices reflect considerations of global well-being or altruism, or idiosyncratic attitudes to risk. Sometimes, they reflect religious or unusual values. However, in some other cases, controversial choices are irrational and are not expressions of our autonomy.Case Example 1. Amputation for apotemnophilia\nA Scottish surgeon, Mr Robert Smith, amputated the healthy legs of two patients suffering from apotemnophilia, a body dysmorphic disorder in which the patient feels incomplete with four limbs. The patients had received psychiatric and psychological treatment prior to the operation, but had failed to respond to these methods. Both operations were carried out privately and not publicly funded, and the patients were satisfied with the results. The NHS Trust responsible for the hospital banned further amputations.2\nCase Example 2. Requests for \u201cFutile\u201d Medical Treatment\nMr Leslie Burke was 45 years old.3He had been diagnosed in 1982 with cerebellar ataxia, a degenerative brain disease.4He was wheelchair-bound and his speech was affected4, though his mental capacity was intact.4Due to the progressive nature of Mr Burke's disease, he would require artificial nutrition and hydration at some point. He sought a court ruling that such treatment be provided if he became incompetent. Mr Burke sought a declaration that the rights enunciated in Articles 2,3,8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights pursuant to the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK) were breached by the General Medical Council's guidance entitled, \u2018Withholding and Withdrawing Life-Prolonging Treatments: Good Practice in Decision-Making\u2019.5\nJustice Munby ruled in favour of Mr Burke, 6and declared that parts of the Guidance were unlawful, as a competent person pursuant to Articles 37and 8, is able to demand artificial nutrition and hydration in accordance with the rights of dignity and autonomy which enable a person to die in a manner in accordance with their desires.8\nHowever, the decision was appealed.9The Court of Appeal ruled that Justice Munby erred in law. The Court of Appeal found that the Guidance was lawful and that it did not contravene Articles 2,3 or 8 of the Convention and set aside the six declarations10made by Munby.\n",

Importantly, being autonomous does not merely involving being competent and making a choice \u2013 it involves constructing a concept of how one's life should go according to a coherent set of values. Some choices frustrate or undermine our deepest values and autonomy. Thus, even though legally patients can refuse treatment on any grounds, however irrational, there are compelling ethical arguments to suggest that the exercise of full autonomy requires some element of rationality in addition to those elements of information and understanding identified by the courts.*13, 14 These arguments are based on the concept of self-determination. The idea of self-determination is not mere choice but an evaluative choice of which of the available courses of actions is better or best. The reason that information is important is to enable an understanding of the true nature of the actions in question and their consequences; but if information is important, so too is a degree of at least rationality to draw correct inferences from these facts and to fully appreciate the options on offer.14\n",

Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct. Secondly, that for such actions as are prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable, and may be subjected either to social or legal punishment, if society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its protection.\u201d25\n",

There are a number of explanations for this prohibition, the most popular and widely accepted being that this accords with the biblical injunction to refrain from the consumption of blood.34 Current interpretation also adds that the Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the individual's life is represented by their blood whose consumption would be abhorrent.

Many Jehovah's Witnesses make a legally binding Advance Directive in order to forestall any possibility of such treatment being given once they lapse into an unconscious state or lose their capacity.Case Example 3:\nA 52 year old male with upper GI bleeding is admitted to the emergency department in a poor condition with borderline hypotension and signs of incipient circulatory failure. He refuses blood or blood products on religious grounds and states that he is a Jehovah's Witness. He carries a properly executed advanced directive. His wife accompanies him. She is not a devout Jehovah's Witness and begs the attending medical staff to ignore his wishes and treat him with blood. During the resuscitation period senior members of the patient's congregation visit and support the patient's refusal to accept transfusion.\nThe attending medical staff use non- blood products to raise the circulating volume to allow the patient to be counselled about the risks he runs, including the likelihood of death. In spite of the aggressive volume replacement and other pharmacological support bleeding continues and the patient is referred for emergency surgery in an attempt to control the bleeding. During surgery the patient goes into cardiac arrest from which he cannot be resuscitated.\n",

This is wrong and would destroy patient confidence in their medical attendant in addition to placing the physician at risk of professional, criminal and legal proceedings.35\nCase Example 4:\nA 5 year old is admitted following a Motor Vehicle Collision with intra-abdominal bleeding from a splenic tear whose parents refuse blood transfusion as they are both devout Jehovah's witnesses. The risks to the child's life are explained but the parents are adamant that they will not permit transfusion but consent to surgery. In the opinion of the medical attendants, surgery without transfusion is likely to be unsuccessful so following explanation to the family present of the procedure they intend to follow, they request the hospital management urgently instruct the Trust's solicitor to seek a Court order to permit transfusion.

The teenager is conscious and alert and expresses the view that he does not wish to die and that the doctors should go ahead and do whatever they need to, including transfusion.

Some patients are unable to follow the regimen prescribed for them through poor education, poor explanation, wilful behaviour or simple lack of thought. As a consequence the patient may be at increased risk if anaesthesia is not delayed in order for full stabilisation to be achieved. This may result in an increased risk of the presenting condition becoming more significant. Can an increased risk from the primary pathology be balanced against an increased risk from delayed treatment of the presenting condition?Case Example 12:\nA hypertensive patient on antihypertensive therapy is admitted for surgery to a newly diagnosed breast cancer. She has not taken her antihypertensive treatment regularly, but any delay in surgery could lead to the development of metastasises and a poorer outcome from surgery. Surgery must be undertaken as soon as the blood pressure levels are acceptable even when not yet optimal. The increased risk to the patient of the failure to await optimisation must be explained to the patient and her views also taken into consideration. Follow up for the hypertension must be planned to encourage future compliance.\nCase Example 13:\nA hypertensive patient on antihypertensive therapy admitted for surgery to repair a cruciate ligament in the knee. She is found to have been non compliant in respect of medication and the blood pressure is significantly raised. The patient has made extensive arrangements for the care during her hospital admission of her elderly parent who lives with her. She pleads with you not to cancel her operation and promises to take her medication regularly in future. You explain that any additional morbidity which could arise peri-operatively as a result of her previous non compliance is likely to make her less able to care for her parent and that a delay in surgery to bring her hypertension back under control is in fact in her and her parents best interest.

It is supererogatory, above and beyond one's moral call to duty, to help others when the risk to oneself is significant. In general, we should encourage clinicians to voluntarily assume significant risks, through compensation, praise or other means, rather than legally compelling them to treat high risk patients. In the extreme of public health emergencies, the law might be required to ensure sufficient numbers of doctors risk their lives in the public interest.",

Is the provision of anaesthesia to facilitate this procedure ethical?\nCase Example 21:\nA 3 month old baby is referred for anaesthesia to permit MRI for the diagnosis of possible birth trauma which if carried out will not enhance the medical care or diagnosis but which will be used by the legal representatives of the baby to support a case against the obstetrician. Is it ethical to provide anaesthesia where there is no medical indication but where the risks of the anaesthetic procedure are not insubstantial?\nCase Example 22:\nA 65 year old with a recent history of an acute MI demands a face lift as he wishes to marry a much younger woman. The cardiac status is fragile and unlikely to be improved by treatment. The anaesthetist explains the risks of surgery and anaesthesia but the patient says that he is prepared to go ahead at any risk. Is it ethical to proceed?\n",

The patient must equally be aware that in most situations the clinician will accept these demands even when these demands place an extra burden on the clinician that could negatively affect the care which can be provided. Conversely, situations might arise, particularly in an environment with strict financial or resource limitations, when the extra burden of the challenge cannot be accepted. At all times awareness of the rights of the patient by the clinician and vice versa should lead to open and helpful dialogue in order that a mutually acceptable treatment plan can be reached.",
