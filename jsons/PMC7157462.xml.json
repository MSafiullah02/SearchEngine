While limited in scope and resolution, these and other early viromes provided an unprecedented view of complex viral communities in nature. Both oceanic and human fecal viromes pointed toward the existence of an extensive virus diversity. This diversity of the virosphere was estimated by comparing the sequencing reads within each metagenome, and observing that almost every fragment was unique. Moreover, comparing the short sequencing reads to a reference database of known viral genomes sequences revealed that up to 99% was not similar to any known virus, suggesting that most of the virosphere was yet to be discovered. This uncharted genomic biodiversity became popularly known as \u201cviral dark matter\u201d.",

Improvements in DNA sequencing technologies, especially the advent of the popular pyrosequencing platform, that has since been surpassed and discontinued, increased the scale of these datasets by providing hundreds of thousands of short genomic fragments for each sample. By directly comparing the sequences across these datasets, several studies indicated that virus genes tend to structure by environment rather than by sample location, implying that some of these genes may be globally distributed. In addition, when sampled from the same freshwater and hypersaline ponds across several days, weeks, and months, viral metagenomes revealed that the genetic composition of viral communities was coherent at a broad level, but some individual viral genes experienced rapid changes in relative abundance.",

However, it is important to note that the detection of a (novel) virus in a sample from a patient with an illness of unknown etiology does not prove causation, even in cases of a demonstrated significant association between the presence of the virus sequence and the observed symptoms. Hence, metagenomics will often be the first step of a longer process involving attempts to propagate the virus in culture, or monitoring healthy individuals exposed to the suspected pathogen (see below \u201cFuture of viral metagenomics: major challenges and upcoming innovations\u201d).",

Species representing important reservoirs of viruses with high zoonotic pandemic potential such as mosquitoes, rodents, and bats have been specifically targeted in this context. A recent study investigating the virome of more than 200 invertebrate species (a fraction of known invertebrate species), identified more than 1,400 novel RNA viruses, exemplifying that the diversity of unknown eukaryotic viruses in the environment is enormous and only poorly characterized. Since the majority of human pandemics have a zoonotic origin, one hope is that such metagenomic surveillance will allow a faster identification of novel pandemic viruses during outbreaks, as well as identify their natural reservoirs. This knowledge is crucial for an appropriate and fast response from a medical and global health perspective. As an example, in the last two decades zoonotic coronaviruses were able to jump from bats to humans and pigs. Both the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) viruses caused large-scale disease outbreaks in humans, whereas SADS (Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome) caused an epidemic in the swine industry. Ongoing efforts to characterize the virome of such reservoir animals will facilitate the implementation of control measure to prevent epidemics or enforce appreciate actions to stop ongoing epidemics. In an ideal situation, obtained environmental virome data in combination with biochemical experiments could help with the early identification of candidate viruses with the potential to transfer to a human host. For instance, a combination of metagenomics and DNA synthesis-based experiments revealed that a novel coronavirus (WIV1-CoV) initially detected in bat samples could be prime for transfer and emergence into human hosts.",

The crAssphage genome was identified by combining information from 12 individual viromes, which yielded a high-confidence 97 kb sequence with matching 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, suggesting that it represented a complete circular genome. This crAssphage genome was mostly unrelated to any isolated phage genome known at the time: from the 80 predicted proteins, less than half (39) were even remotely similar to known proteins or domains, and only 25 had a predicted function, such as \u201cphage structural protein\u201d or \u201cDNA helicase\u201d. While clearly novel, crAssphage was also found to be uniquely abundant and ubiquitous: its genome was detected across 940 metagenomes, primarily from human feces, at average levels that were six times higher than all other known phages combined. By applying several independent computational host-prediction approaches, a bacterial host (Bacteroides) was predicted. Thus, in this instance, metagenomics revealed what remains to date the most abundant and widespread phage associated with the human gut microbiome, which had until then evaded detection through classical approaches like laboratory cultivation and PCR.",

First, predicted proteins from the original crAssphage genome were used as \u201cbait\u201d to identify related phages in a broad range of metagenomes. This revealed an extensive and diverse group of \u201ccrAss-like\u201d phages predicted to represent a new family within the Caudovirales order, that may be related to Podoviridae. Genome comparisons within this new family also enabled the identification of conserved structural and replication gene modules. Meanwhile, another study was able to isolate a member of the crAssphage-like family through broth enrichment on Bacteroides intestinalis strains isolated from human gut samples, confirming the computational predictions from bioinformatic analyses that these phages were likely infecting Bacteroidetes hosts and had a Podoviridae-like morphology.",

More recently, four complete or near-complete giant virus genomes could be assembled from metagenomes of a wastewater treatment plant. This revealed a new subgroup of giant viruses named Klosneuviruses which comprised some genomes with the largest set of translation system components found at the time in any virus, including aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases with specificity for all 20 amino acids. Undoubtedly, as our collective ability to assemble large genomes from metagenomes increases, the giant virus diversity will keep expanding.",

The latter saw the more striking expansion: until 2009, these viruses were known exclusively in plants and vertebrates, specifically pigs and birds, yet in less than a decade, CRESS DNA viruses were detected in metagenomes sampled from primates, arthropods, and unicellular protists, as well as diverse aquatic, terrestrial, and man-made ecosystems.

In the field of viral metagenomics, this increased capacity has been leveraged specifically to analyze viral signal along time series and thus investigate virus-host dynamics in nature. Such datasets have notably been obtained from freshwater lakes, for which recurrent sampling across months or years can be done, and which usually harbor a high concentration of viruses. These first explorations of environmental viral diversity across months and seasons indicated that viruses display a large range of relative abundance patterns, from \u201cephemeral\u201d ones with a single peak in abundance to \u201cconstitutive\u201d ones detected in virtually all samples. Some of these patterns were seasonal and possibly linked to similar patterns of abundance for their microbial hosts, while other viruses displayed drastic changes from one year to the next. For instance, although longitudinal virome studies of the human gut are scarce, available data suggests a rather stable population of gut viruses (almost exclusively phages) in adults over time, whereas the infant gut virome is much more variable and may be dominated by eukaryotic viruses at particular time point coinciding with an acute enteric infection.",

The latter raised the intriguing possibility of complex and diverse virus-host relationships occurring in nature: while the expected patterns would be a strong correlation between virus and host abundances with possibly a short lag in the virus signal in a typical predator-prey fashion, these large-scale metagenome time series instead suggested that some of the viruses could peak prior to a peak in abundance of their host, while other virus-host pairs showed no similarity in relative abundance at all. These conflicting results likely reflect the complex interactions at play between viruses and microbes in nature, including variable host ranges, from viruses infecting a unique host strain to others infecting multiple host species sometimes across different genera, as well as the spectrum of infection dynamics from fast-acting lytic viruses to slower, temperate, and even chronic ones, and the development of resistance to the virus among the host population.

In a clinical context, this means that one of Koch\u2019s postulates, which requires that the candidate etiological agent be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture, cannot be fulfilled. Already, several smacoviruses which had been detected in human samples metagenomes and suspected to represent new human viral pathogens have been found to likely infect prokaryotic cells from the human microbiome instead. In a similar way, evidence is emerging that picobirnaviruses, which are believed to be eukaryotic viruses, might actually infect bacterial cells. These examples should thus serve as a cautionary tale when trying to detect entirely new viral pathogens from mixed samples containing both human and microbial cells. A modified Koch\u2019s postulate for the metagenomic era has been proposed in which potential new pathogens must first be present and more abundant in the diseased subject compared to matched control. Then, experiments using either a sample from a disease subject or an artificial virus obtained through DNA synthesis and expression in cell cultures must be performed to demonstrate that this agent induces disease in another healthy subject.

First, long-read sequencing technologies are progressively amenable to the sequencing of environmental viral communities.

Once broadly available, these long-reads metagenomes will not only bypass assembly issues but also provide valuable information about virus genome evolution by enabling whole-genome phasing of polymorphisms. Meanwhile, in an epidemiological context, long-read sequencing technologies associated with miniaturized devices, streamlined sample preparation, and live scanning of the sequencing results offers unique possibility for real-time surveillance or diagnostics. This is especially the case for the MinION sequencer based on Nanopore sequencing technology, allowing the identification of viral pathogens from a patient sample in less than 6 h, compared to more than 20 h for other sequencing technologies.

Concretely, these technological improvements will translate into a lower cost per sample, and an increased ability to process hundreds of samples in parallel in a timely fashion, in particular through laboratory robotics automation. For the detection of viral pathogens as well as the exploration of viral diversity and virus-host interactions in nature, this increased throughput will provide the opportunity to generate e.g., high-resolution time-series, possibly including paired cellular and viral size fractions with multiple replicates per sample, enabling more robust and sensitive data analyses.",

Moreover, as bioinformatics analysis tools advance, the reconstruction of full viral genome sequences will allow predictions to be made for the most important viruses in different environments, leading to the reconstruction of environmental virus-host networks and, when combined with other 'omics' approaches, the comprehensive evaluation of viral activity across an entire ecosystem. Collectively, these studies should lead to a deeper understanding of viral impacts on ecological, evolutionary, and metabolic processes as well as information on potentially new viral pathogens and putative molecular virus-host interactions which could then be further characterized through targeted laboratory experiments. Hence viral metagenomics will remain a central and fundamental way to interrogate the viral world in many research fields.",

The overall process used to generate and analyze viral metagenomes can be divided into four major steps: (i) Collection of environmental and/or clinical sample, (ii) sample preparation, (iii) library preparation, and (iv) sequence analysis. The sample preparation step can target either the cellular fraction (left) or the viral fraction (right) in which case viral particles are often further concentrated and purified to remove free nucleic acids. *Targeted sequence capture can be applied to the extracted DNA/RNA to enrich for a specific virus. **While whole genome amplification was initially used routinely for viral metagenomes, it has now been supplanted by methods enabling the preparation of more quantitative libraries from low input (~ 1 ng), hence whole genome amplification is now primarily used in single-cell or single-virus-particle experiments. ***The genome assembly can be bypassed if using long-read sequencing technologies, although these long-read datasets require a more careful error correction. ****Genome binning, i.e., the identification of multiple contigs assembled from a metagenome and corresponding to the same genome, is typically only used for large genomes (e.g., >500 kb), and individual contigs are directly analyzed instead for most viruses.",
