Nonetheless, to date, neither the proposed stimulus package nor other GI policy proposals discuss how these influxes of cash will or will not interact with means tested benefits and income thresholds, leaving some households at risk of preserving their financial stability at the expense of their access to health insurance and other benefits (Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, 2019) (Stockton Economyic ic). In the midst of an unprecedented crisis and a surge of GI experiments, the field of public health and allied disciplines are ideally situated to lead the policy community in developing models that assist policy makers in ensuring that cash transfer interventions and GI experiments preserve benefits rather than produce new forms of inequality.

At present, the public discourse around GI reflects three options: (1) the federal coronavirus cash transfer program which would provide American tax filers earning less than $75,000 ($150,000 joint return) a single payment of $1200 per individual ($2400 joint return) and $500 per qualifying dependent, but does not specify how or if this transfer would impact eligibility for existing means tested benefits (Jamerson, Duehren, & Andrews, 2020);", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 256, "text": "(Blumgart, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 270, "end": 283, "text": "(Crowe, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Policy landscape"}, {"text": "(2) proposals which seek to replace existing means tested benefits with a basic GI for all Americans; and (3) the Stockton Plan, described here, which seeks to provide GI alongside existing means tested benefits.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Policy landscape"}, {"text": "Option two, espoused by Yang, is predicated on Milton Friedman's ideal GI structure, whereby cash transfers are designed to completely replace all means tested benefits under the auspices of improved government efficiency and enhanced work incentives for recipients (Moffitt, 2003) . Friedman's proposal was intended to be tested in the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment (SIME/DIME), one of the largest negative income experiments of the 1970s. Members of the experimental group already receiving cash welfare were required to choose monthly whether to receive cash benefits from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or the negative income tax. The intended design testing SIME/DIME against existing safety net benefits was upended, as treatment group members receiving AFDC would not sign over to receive the negative income tax without protection of existing benefits, including health insurance, housing vouchers, and subsidized childcare (Christphersen, 1983) . Thus, a GI option that fails to protect against the detrimental health and financial impacts of benefits loss in the current policy landscape is demonstrably infeasible. Herein, we present option three, the Stockton Plan, which draws on an ethical framework informed by public health and social work codes of ethics, and research informed by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). This makes SEED the first contemporary pilot to bring the ethical concerns around loss of benefits to the forefront of the GI policy debate, and one that can guide ethical and just implementation of GI. Rather than relying on economic projections, GI pilots are taking place in real time and carry real world impacts for recipients. Thus, there is a clear immediacy for public health and social work professionals to uphold the ethics of the respective professions while producing sound empirical evidence capable of influencing public policy. Moreover, while some developing GI pilots may not be governed by human subject research protections mandated by IRBs, similar ethical measures should be considered to protect GI recipients within the existing policy landscape. This paper demonstrates how SEED used ethical mandates of both public health and social work to attend to ethical conflicts inherent in GI experimentation.

These potential shifts are already present in low-wage retail sectors where automation is eliminating human contact in a variety of transactions previously marked with relational interactions (Hegewisch & Hartmann, 2019) . Meanwhile, unlike early research around the digital divide citing socio-economic gaps between those with access to technological advances and information technology and those without (Norris, 2001) , the drop in the cost of technology coupled with the comparatively expensive nature of human employment is rendering new questions about who is granted access to human contact in their everyday lives and under what terms. As Nellie Bowles (2019) argues, \"human contact is now a luxury good,\" whereby those with considerably more capital have the latitude to ensure their children's education, their market transactions, their care work, and medical interactions are laced with relational interactions rather than mediated through screens and artificial intelligence. Part of GI's appeal is its potential to address the threat of technological unemployment through a mechanism that simultaneously reduces the friction of human contact required to maintain large bureaucratic structures governed by means testing. Paradoxically, however, the final critical tier of mitigating benefits loss, upholding ethical principles and ensuring implementation efficiency, rests on the human contact and relationship building between SEED's program staff and the research team.
