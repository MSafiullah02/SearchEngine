Most infections with hMPV have been detected during winter and spring. Infection in all age groups has been documented [2, 4, 7, 9, [12] [13] [14] [15] , although young children and elderly persons may be particularly prone [7, 13, 14] . The clinical features associated with hMPV infection in children are consistent with both upper and lower respiratory-tract infections [4, 7, 13] . Jartti et al. [10] have detected hMPV in children who presented with acute wheezing. We have previously reported [13] the clinical features associated with hMPV in infants and young children. To investigate the epidemiology and to describe further the clinical syndrome associated with this newly emerging respiratory pathogen, we tested respiratory specimens from children that were obtained over a 1-year period. Here we describe the seasonal distribution, phylogenetic analysis, and clinical characteristics of infection with hMPV in Connecticut. RNA specimens were then tested by RT-PCR for the presence of hMPV. Random hexamer primers were used to create a cDNA library for each specimen. RT reactions were performed with MuMLV RT (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Each cDNA was subsequently tested by PCR with HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's specification. The primers used in the initial testing of the respiratory specimens were based on sequence data of a Dutch strain available from GenBank (accession number AF371367) and targeted the hMPV F gene. After the amplification and sequencing of the F gene of the first strain of hMPV that we identified, primers were synthesized that targeted regions of the hMPV F gene that were conserved among Dutch, Australian (GenBank accession number AF442516, which subsequently became available), and Connecticut strains. The forward primer, 5 -GCGCGTTCTGA-GGACAGGTTGG, and reverse primer, 5 -GCGCTCAAGCCG-GATGGTTTTGG, produce an amplicon that corresponds to nt 111-392 of the hMPV F gene (GenBank accession number AF371367). G/C clamps for each primer are underlined. All respiratory specimens were tested using these conserved primer sets. Primers were synthesized at the Yale Oligonucleotide Laboratory, Department of Pathology. Each set of RT and PCR reactions contained appropriate negative controls. PCR amplification cycles were as follows: 95\u040aC for 15 min; 35 cycles of 94\u040aC for 1 min, 45\u040aC-55\u040aC for 1 min, and 72\u040aC for 1 min; and 72\u040aC for 10 min.
