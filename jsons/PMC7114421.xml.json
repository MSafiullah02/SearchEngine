Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a representative CoV in the alphacoronavirus genus; severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-related CoV) is a representative of the betacoronavirus genus; infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a representative of the gammacoronavirus genus; and Bulbul-CoV is a representative of the deltacoronavirus genus (de Groot et al., 2011). The Coronaviridae are involved in respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neuronal infectious disease in animals and humans (Perlman and Netland, 2009).",

About two-thirds of the TGEV genome (28.5 kb) encodes the replicase gene (rep) at the 5\u2032 end, and one-third of the genome encodes other viral genes at the 3\u2032 end in the order 5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 (Penzes et al., 2001). The genome of the TGEV encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N). N proteins of CoVs are highly basic with a molecular mass ranging from 40 to 63 kDa, depending on the species and strains. N protein binds to the RNA genome, forming a helical nucleocapsid (Escors et al., 2001, Sturman et al., 1980).",

N protein of TGEV facilitates template switching and is required for efficient transcription (Zuniga et al., 2010). N protein underwent proteolysis in parallel with the activation of caspases within host cell and N protein of TGEV is a substrate for caspases (Eleouet et al., 2000). TGEV N protein nucleolus localization was found in transfection experiments and might induced a cell cycle delay or arrest to facilitate virus replication (Wurm et al., 2001). In contrast, TGEV N protein was not accumulated in the nucleus in the infection context (Calvo et al., 2005). In addition, the role of TGEV N protein in cell cycle arrest has been recently reported (Ding et al., 2014). N protein of TGEV may function through direct or indirect interaction with cellular proteins.",

Similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses, CoV genome replication takes place in the cytoplasm in a membrane-protected microenvironment that contains all the protein required for viral RNA synthesis (Enjuanes et al., 2006). Electron microscopy studies of mouse-hepatitis-virus-infected cells have shown that replication complexes of virus consist of double-membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002). CoV replication complex formation possibly utilizes components of cellular autophagy (Prentice et al., 2004). Although CoV replication essentially takes place within the cytoplasm, the virus may control cell machinery by locating some of its proteins in host cell nucleus (Enjuanes et al., 2006). In the present study, vimentin was identified in pull-down assay and Co-IP assay, suggesting that it plays an important role in TGEV infection. Co-staining of cellular vimentin and N protein on immunofluorescence microscopy also supported an association between proteins. Based on these findings, we speculate that vimentin plays a role in TGEV replication.",

Vimentin binding is critical for virus entry, such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Miller and Hertel, 2009), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (Liang et al., 2011), and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) (Koudelka et al., 2009). Vimentin is required for virus replication, such as bluetongue virus (BTV) (Bhattacharya et al., 2007), and dengue virus (DENV) (Kanlaya et al., 2010). In this study, vimentin is required for TGEV replication. Therefore, these may potentially serve as novel therapeutic targets for controlling TGEV infection.",
