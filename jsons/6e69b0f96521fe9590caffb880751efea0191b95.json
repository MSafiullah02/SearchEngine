Respiratory viruses, which comprises influenza (IV), human respiratory syncytial (HRSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza, and adenovirus and coronavirus (CoV), can infect the upper and/or lower respiratory tract in humans. Many of them cause common clinical signs and symptoms, including nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, and fever, or more specific and severe manifestations, such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (1) . Respiratory viral infections are, in general, associated with cytokine production, inflammation, cell death, and other pathophysiological processes, which could be link with a redox imbalance or oxidative stress (OS). It is known that an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant mechanisms deprivation are crucial for viral replication and the subsequent virus-associated disease (2). infection is characterized by fever, severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, combined with the incidence of ground-glass opacities, and acute cardiac injury. Of note, a significant high blood levels of cytokines and chemokines have been observed in patients with Covid-19 infection. The \"cytokine storm\" trigger a proinflammatory environment which is strongly associated with a severe tissue damage, contributing with the fatal outcomes of Covid-19 patients (7) . It is well established the link between inflammation and OS (8) . Thus, the aim of the present work was to review the role of OS in the pathogenesis and progression of respiratory diseases caused by SARS-CoVs.",

However, in the preclinical setting, many lines of evidence suggest that overproduction of ROS and a deprived antioxidant system plays a major role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection, as well as in the progression and severity of the respiratory disease. Experimental animal models of severe acute respiratory syndrome have shown an enhanced ROS levels and disturbance of antioxidant defense during SARS-CoV infection (13) . Some authors suggest that the onset of severe lung injury in SARS-CoV infected patients depends on activation of the oxidative stress machinery that is coupled with innate immunity and activates transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB, resulting in an exacerbated proinflammatory host response (14) . Lin and coworkers (15) , showed that SARS-CoV 3CL pro (a viral protease) caused a Arch Med Res E20_477 5 significant increase in ROS production in HL-CZ cells, which in turn, is involved in 3CL pro -induced cell apoptosis. In this study, the authors demonstrated that SARS-CoV 3CL pro activates NF-kBdependent reporter gene, which was correlated with the increase of ROS levels in HL-CZ cells.",

In addition, other SARS-CoV\u00b4s protease, the 3a protein, has been associated with the activation of mitochondrial cell death pathways (intrinsic and extrinsic signaling). The proposed mechanism involves Bax oligomerization and higher levels of p53 in 3a protein-expressing Huh7 cells, which depended on the p38 MAPK activation in these cells (16) . Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are a family of serine/threonine that are activated in response of environmentally stresses including oxidative stress, DNA damage, carcinogenic stimuli and viral infections. Activated (phosphorylated) forms of all MAPK members has been detected in cells infected with SARS-CoV (2).",

Also, activation of apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV, in particular HCoVs, was described in previous in vitro studies and animal models (17) . Apoptosis can be induced by multiple mechanisms in HCoV-infected cells. CoV was shown to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis, needed for viral replication (18) . Literature reports suggested that SARS-CoV replicates in Vero-E6 cells inducing a weak Akt signaling pathway activation, which cannot prevent apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV infection (19) . Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by a variety of viruses is thought to be involved in the establishment of latent and chronic infections by allowing virus-infected cells to escape from apoptosis. Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may lead to a delay in Oxidative stress -NF-kB -toll-like receptor (mainly TL4) signaling pathways, triggered by viral pathogens like SARS-CoV, may further amplify the host inflammatory response, ultimately leading to acute lung injury. TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 signaling was identified as a pathogenic pathway that can mediate the severity of acute lung injury. The oxidized phospholipid, generated by lung macrophages, was able to induce cytokine overproduction and lung injury via TLR4-TRIF. Oxidized phospholipids have been previously identified in human and animal lungs infected with SARS virus. In in vivo models, loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protected mice from H5N1-induced acute lung injury (ALI). In addition, deletion of ncf1, which can regulate ROS generation, improves the severity of IVinduced ALI. Thus, these authors suggest that oxidative stress and innate immunity play key roles in the severity of ALI caused by respiratory viruses (22) .",

It is suggested that age related accumulated oxidative damage and a weakened antioxidant defense system cause a disturbance in the redox balance, resulting in increased reacting oxygen species. Therefore, ageing is not only associated with alterations in the adaptive immune response, but also with a proinflammatory state in the host.

Several respiratory viruses induce a dysregulated ROS formation, as a result of increased inflammatory cell recruitment at the site of infection.
