            "text": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction and cell death are features of numerous human CNS diseases, such as demyelinating diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis), stroke, spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. multiple system atrophy) (Barnett and Prineas, 2004, Lucchinetti et al., 2000, Wenning et al., 2008). However, although oligodendroglial cell death is a common feature in many CNS diseases, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent human demyelinating disorder with heterogeneous clinical and pathological findings. Histopathologically, two different categories can be distinguished: One pattern is characterized by immune-mediated demyelination while the other is characterized by a primary oligodendrogliopathy. The morphology of dying oligodendrocytes in MS lesions shows some characteristics of apoptosis, e.g. condensed and fragmented nuclei; additionally, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as bcl-2, p53 and FAS, has been described in the oligodendrocytes in MS lesions (Dowling et al., 1996, Kuhlmann et al., 1999, Wosik et al., 2003). The FAS signalling cascade has been shown to be involved in oligodendroglial cell death in vitro and in vivo. In vitro incubation of human oligodendroglial cell lines with FAS ligand leads to apoptotic cell death (Austin and Fehlings, 2008, Li et al., 2002). Challenging primary human oligodendrocytes with IFN\u03b3 or increased levels of p53 renders oligodendrocytes susceptible to FAS-mediated cell death (Pouly et al., 2000, Wosik et al., 2003). Additionally, FAS has been shown to be upregulated in oligodendrocytes in MS lesions as well as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS (Bonetti et al., 1993, Bonetti and Raine, 1997, Dowling et al., 1996, Raine et al., 1998, Sabelko-Downes et al., 1999). Mice lacking FAS especially in oligodendrocytes show limited oligodendroglial cell death and reduced clinical symptoms in EAE (Hovelmeyer et al., 2005).",

Demyelination is induced by administering a cuprizone diet for up to 6 weeks, which leads to apoptotic oligodendroglial cell death via unknown pathways. While demyelination is most extensive 6 weeks after initiating the cuprizone diet, oligodendroglial cell death starts earlier. The number of oligodendrocytes decreases significantly in the second and third week and reaches its minimum 4 weeks after start of the cuprizone diet (Matsushima and Morell, 2001).",

Oligodendroglial cell death occurs within few days after initiation of the cuprizone diet and weeks before demyelination is visible. During the initial phase of the cuprizone diet (days 6 and 10), but not during later stages (day 21), activated caspase 3 can be detected in apoptotic oligodendrocytes, suggesting that caspase 3-independent pathways trigger oligodendroglial cell death in later stages. The mRNA expression levels of FAS in the corpus callosum correlate with the expression pattern of activated caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes. However, animal experiments using mice lacking FAS especially in oligodendrocytes reveal that FAS is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death in the cuprizone model.",

In the cuprizone model, the loss of oligodendrocytes is accompanied by the expansion of microglia cells and infiltration of macrophages, whereby microglia cells substantially outnumber macrophages (Remington et al., 2007). This is in line with the observation that cuprizone does not promote a leakage of the blood\u2013brain barrier (Matsushima and Morell, 2001, McMahon et al., 2002).

We focussed on the first 10 days since the majority of dying oligodendroglial cells express activated caspase 3 during this time period, indicating elimination of oligodendrocytes via classical apoptotic cell death pathways. The number of apoptotic cells, Nogo-A-positive oligodendrocytes, activated caspase 3-expressing oligodendrocytes, macrophages and astrocytes, as well as the extent of demyelination, was determined on days 4, 6 and 10 and in mice fed with a cuprizone-free diet (controls). Similar numbers of apoptotic cells were found on days 4, 6 and 10 (between 97 \u00b1 46 and 143 \u00b1 12 cells/mm2; Fig. 5\na). As in the previous experiments, a high percentage of the dying oligodendrocytes expressed activated caspase 3 on day 4 (FAS-KO 98 \u00b1 3%; FAS-wt 100 \u00b1 0%), and day 6 (FAS-KO 100 \u00b1 0%; FAS-wt 83 \u00b1 17%). On day 10 after the start of the cuprizone diet, 47 \u00b1 18% or 62 \u00b1 23%, respectively, expressed activated caspase 3 (Fig. 5b). However, no significant differences in the number of apoptotic cells or in the percentage of activated caspase 3-positive cells were found between FAS-KO and FAS-wt animals indicating that FAS is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death in toxic demyelination (Figs. 5a and b). In neither FAS-wt nor in FAS-KO mice did the LFB-PAS staining reveal significant demyelination (data not shown). As expected, the number of Nogo-A-positive oligodendrocytes decreased significantly during the cuprizone diet, whereas the numbers of microglia/macrophages increased significantly. Similar numbers of oligodendrocytes, microglia/macrophages and astrocytes were found in FAS-KO compared to FAS-wt mice on the vast majority of time points analyzed (Figs. 5c\u2013e).",

Here, we demonstrate that in this toxic demyelination model oligodendroglial cell death occurs very early and precedes demyelination by weeks. In the early disease phase oligodendroglial cell death is associated with the expression of activated caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes, whereas in later disease stages oligodendroglial cell death is apparently independent of caspase 3. FAS is upregulated in the corpus callosum in the early disease stage in the cuprizone model; however, it is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death in cuprizone-induced demyelination.",

Similarly, the myelin gene expression was maximally reduced 3 weeks after initiation of the cuprizone diet while at 4 weeks a slight increase was observed (Jurevics et al., 2002, Matsushima and Morell, 2001). This is in line with our findings presented here. We observed a continuous decrease of Nogo-A-positive oligodendrocytes during the cuprizone diet and maximal numbers of apoptotic oligodendrocytes were found 10 and 21 days after start of the cuprizone diet. This was accompanied by a dramatic decrease of myelin gene expression already obvious on day 6. Together, these data confirm that the vast majority of mature oligodendrocytes undergo cell death during the first 3 weeks of the cuprizone diet.",

            "text": "In the initial phases of the cuprizone model, almost all dying oligodendrocytes express activated caspase 3, suggesting that this is the dominant mechanism by which oligodendrocytes are eliminated. However, in later disease stages the percentage of activated caspase 3-positive oligodendrocytes decreases gradually to the complete absence of caspase 3 on day 21. These findings are suggestive for a change from a caspase 3-dependent to a caspase 3-independent cell death mechanism in the cuprizone model. The dying oligodendrocytes still display some morphological characteristics of apoptosis, this makes it tempting to speculate that apoptotic-like cell death mechanisms might contribute to oligodendroglial cell death at later stages (for a review, see Boujrad et al., 2007). This type of cell death is controlled by mitochondria, and one of the major effectors might be the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Increased Ca2+ levels and generation of oxygen species are triggers for release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It is conceivable that cuprizone, which has been described as damaging mitochondria, also directly or indirectly mediates the mitochondrial release of AIF (Maloff et al., 1978). Downstream signalling cascades may involve poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, calpains or EndoG (Moubarak et al., 2007, Niikura et al., 2007). However, so far no direct evidence exists that indicates a contribution of this pathway to cuprizone-induced demyelination; further studies are required to reveal the exact mechanisms underlying caspase-independent cell death in later stages of the cuprizone diet.",

            "text": "The cuprizone model is a relatively artificial model and cannot be regarded as a prototypical paradigm mimicking oligodendroglial cell death in human demyelinating diseases. However, it provides insights in general cell death mechanisms that can be activated in oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, since the cuprizone model is frequently used to study remyelination, the mechanisms leading to demyelination and oligodendroglial cell death deserve deeper understanding. Little is known about potential pathways leading to the cleavage and activation of caspase 3 in the cuprizone model. Mice on the cuprizone diet lacking p53 or treated with the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-\u03b1 show reduced apoptosis and improved preservation of oligodendrocytes as well myelin, suggesting that p53 is involved in oligodendroglial cell death in this toxic demyelination model (Li et al., 2008). Increased expression of p53 has been observed in MS lesions and leads in vitro to an increased susceptibility to FAS- or TRAIL-mediated oligodendroglial cell death (Wosik et al., 2003). FAS has been shown to be upregulated in oligodendrocytes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in coronavirus-induced oligodendroglial cell death, in animal models of spinal cord injury and hypoxia-induced demyelination as well as in MS lesions and multiple systems atrophy (Casha et al., 2001, Gerstner et al., 2007, Hovelmeyer et al., 2005, Liu and Zhang, 2007). In animal models of spinal cord trauma, the lack of FAS or neutralization of FAS ligand is associated with increased oligodendroglial survival (Casha et al., 2005, Demjen et al., 2004). Mice lacking FAS, especially in oligodendrocytes, show improved clinical symptoms, reduced demyelination and oligodendroglial cell death compared to control animals in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Hovelmeyer et al., 2005). In the cuprizone model, apoptotic oligodendrocytes express activated caspase 3, and this is associated with a significant increase of FAS mRNA in the corpus callosum. However, no differences in the amount of demyelination, oligodendroglial cell death, number of apoptotic cells or inflammatory response was observed, indicating that FAS is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death in the cuprizone model. These data strongly suggest that toxin-induced cell death is mediated via FAS-independent mechanisms, e.g. mitochondrial cell death mechanisms. These results are in contrast to the observed role of FAS for oligodendroglial cell death in EAE (Hovelmeyer et al., 2005). An obvious difference between EAE and the cuprizone model is the role of the immune system. Whereas EAE is an autoimmune-mediated disease in which T cells play a pivotal role, the immune response in the cuprizone model is limited to the activation of macrophages/microglial cells and very low numbers of T cells. In contrast to EAE, the blood\u2013brain barrier remains intact in the cuprizone model (Remington et al., 2007). In EAE, therefore, the immune response may trigger oligodendroglial cell death via the FAS receptor, whereas in the cuprizone model cell death might be mediated via the mitochondrial cascade. In summary, we show that oligodendroglial cell death starts early after initiation of the cuprizone model and weeks before the loss of myelin is obvious by immunohistochemistry. Expression of activated caspase 3 is a prominent feature of dying oligodendrocytes during the early disease phase which is lost in later stages. Additionally, although FAS expression correlates with the expression of activated caspase 3, it is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms leading to oligodendroglial cell death in early and late stages of the cuprizone model.",
