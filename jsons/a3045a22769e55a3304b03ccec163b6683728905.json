SAG include several bacterial enterotoxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and B (SEB) and have been implicated in several human diseases. SAB bind the V[3 region of the TCR outside the groove normally occupied by the antigenic peptide, and also the MHC class II molecule on the surface of antigen presenting cells. In EAE, and possibly in MS there may be a bias in the V]3 TCR usage in particular in the early stages of the disease, before significant epitope spreading has occurred. SAG activation of neuroantigen-reactive T cells bearing the corresponding TCR may lead to a relapse in EAE. This is indeed the case. SAG SEB, which predominantly binds V[3 TCR in mice has been demonstrated to induce relapses in myelin basic protein (MBP)-induced EAE in PL/J and PL/J x SJL/J F1 mice, whose MBP-reactive T cells predominantly use TCR V[38 [4, 5] . Moreover, we confirmed this ability of SEB to induce relapses [6] . In addition, we demonstrated that SEA (which does not bind V]38 in mice) also induces significant relapses. Therefore, although it was originally proposed that V[38 TCR confers specific tendency for autoimmunity [7] , the ability of SAG to reactivate autoimmunity in EAE is not entirely dependent on V[38 TCR.",

It is also known that SAG can activate human neuroantigen-reactive T cells [15] . This may represent an important mechanism whereby infectious agents can (re)activate MS. Knowledge of this possibility also has implications for the treatment of MS. For example, glatiramer acetate, currently successfully used in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, promiscuously binds MHC class II inside the peptide binding groove but not requiring antigen processing [16] . Although initially developed as a mimic of MBP, it suppresses not only MBP-induced EAE but also . This promiscuous MHC binding makes it a potentially very useful immunomodulatory treatment, and it was shown to suppress autoimmune uveitis as well [18] . However, while it suppresses antigen-specific T cell proliferative responses in vitro to nominal antigen, it does not suppress SAG-induced responses, suggesting that its blockade of the peptide-binding site in the MHC class II groove, does not affect SAG binding.

The concept implies the existence of a structural similarity and an immunological cross-reactivity between self antigens of the host and an infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, or yeasts, which elicits an immune response, after which T or B cells developed against these agents respond against crossreactive self-determinants. A most convincing and biologically relevant example of molecular mimicry in human autoimmunity and neuroimmunology is the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) [19] . This is another autoimmune demyelinating disease of the nervous system involving the peripheral nerves. There is convincing evidence for a bacterial etiology in up to 50% of patients. Although typically monophasic, the presentation can be different (for example the various proportions of axonal, myelin, or cranial nerve involvement) and the distribution across age groups in different part of the world can also be different. Campylobacter jejuni is a common gastrointestinal pathogen that causes diarrhea. It also, less frequently causes GBS. However, up to two thirds of patients with GBS have serological evidence of a recent C jejuni infection. Of these serogroup Penner 19 is overrepresented, while, on the other hand, rarely associated with gastroenteritis. Different serogroups express different lipopolysaccharides (LPS) closely resembling human cell surface glycolipids. Infection with C jejuni can thus lead to production of anti-ganglioside antibodies, which cross-react with human glycolipids. The most common such cross-reactive self-antigen is ganglioside GM1.",

It has been shown that GM1 antibody production by B cells of GBS patients is T cell dependent [20] . Moreover, self-glycolipids reactive T cells have bee found both in normal individuals and in patients with MS [21] . In addition, EAE is more severe when the immunogenic brain homogenate contains the glycolipid fraction than when this fraction has been removed [22] . Therefore, a T cell and B cell cross reactive immune response between infectious agent components such as LPS and myelin glycolipids is a conceivable mechanism whereby molecular mimicry generates and activates self-reactive lymphocytes in CNS inflammatory demyelination.",

Moreover, immunization of animals with HBV leads to a histologically evident EAE-like inflammatory demyelination [23] . It is thus conceivable that T cells against antigenic determinants of the HBV polymerase recognize cross-reactive MBP epitopes and become selfreactive. Wucherpfennig et al screened viral sequences for potential homology with the peptide predicted to bind MHC class II groove of the commonest MS-associated haplotype, HLA-DR2 (DRBI*1501), and demonstrated that some of these peptides stimulated myelin antigen (MBP)reactive T cells from patients with MS [24].",

The latter situation is closely linked with the phenomenon of epitope spreading, which is known to occur in EAE and MS, whereby previously unexposed (cryptic) epitopes become exposed during the tissue damage accompanying the initial event [25] . The initial event may be the initial inflammatory demyelinating attack, but also potentially an event with another pathogenesis such as injury, ischemia, or indeed, infection. The latter can be exemplified by the fact that infection with viruses that cause experimental demyelination such as coronavirus or TMEV eventually leads to spreading of the epitope to self-determinants including the known neuroantigens of EAE such as MBP [26] .",

In terms of how this applies to MS, it is likely that not all infections, but those infections preferentially inducing a Th-l-type immune response may trigger or reactivate autoimmunity. In support of this is the fact that the viral sequences found to have homology with HLA-DR2 binding motif capable of activating CNS-reactive T cells from MS patients belong to relatively common human viruses such as EBV [24] . A substantial proportion of people without MS have evidence of EBV exposure. Thus, a large number of HLA-DR2+ individuals would be expected to develop MS if that were the unique requirement for self-reactive T cell activation. The ability to build a 530 ChapterA25 response in which these activated T cells have a Thl phenotype, which may depend on a combination of host and pathogen factors may represent one of the additional requirements necessary for induction of autoimmunity.",

In addition, at the same latitude, there is an inverse altitude gradient, in that the prevalence of MS in mountainous areas is significantly lower than in neighboring regions in industrial valleys [44] .

When the drug is added to the diet of weanling mice for several weeks or longer, a near-total, primary demyelination of the superior cerebellar peduncle develops. The demyelination is caused by oligodendrocyte degeneration, but there is relative preservation of axons. There is a continuum between myelin degeneration via formation of vacuoles and death of oligodendrocytes. The prevalence of these pathological processes is in part dependent of the concentration of the toxin, suggesting that the demyelination via vacuolation does not represent a specific myelinopathy but rather an dose-dependent oligodendrocyte toxicity. The myelin debris is removed by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes. The relatively preserved axons become invested in glial processes. There is a remarkable glial response to demyelination, characterized by the occurrence of immature glial cells, both of astrocytic and oligodendroglial nature. There is also survival of some of the mature oligodendrocytes.",

Cellular sources of remyelination largely represent residual surviving adult oligodendrocytes and new cells differentiated from immature precursor forms. The possibility of perineuronal satellite cells contributing to remyelination has also been proposed. Like in EAE and MS, remyelination is incomplete: the maximal thickness reached by new myelin sheets is V2 that of normal sheets, and the internodal distance is shortened.",

This recurrent demyelination appears to be more protracted and the remyelination potential is more reduced. This is attributed to reduced numbers of surviving oligodendrocytes. The intensity of the glial reaction to the injury is lower compared to the initial reaction, and this may also in part explain the less efficient remyelination. In addition, this model of re-exposure to cuprizone shows that remyelinated axons are not more susceptible to demyelination than axons that have not previously been demyelinated. This finding, if it can be extrapolated to other mechanisms of demyelination, has important implications for EAE and MS.",
