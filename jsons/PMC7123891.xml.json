This is thanks in large part to the postcolonial critique\u2014to our changing understanding of centre\u2013periphery relationships\u2014and to the spatial turn\u2014the renewed interest in the roles of space and place from human geography and many other disciplines. The classical conception of culture honed by traditional anthropology sought to define identitythrough differentiation from others, and correspondingly, to map this differentiated group onto a specific place (Papastergiadis 2000, 49). This view of culture is inherently problematic, however, as unmoving and unchallenged conceptions of place map so neatly on to fixed notions of culture . Marc Aug\u00e9 writes:One of the major concerns of ethnology has been to delineate signifying space in the world, societies identified with cultures conceived as complete wholes: universes of meaning, of which the individuals and groups inside them are just an expression, defining themselves in terms of the same criteria, the same values and the same interpretation procedures.

Rather, they are socially and politically constructed: the assumed homogeneity and internal sameness of bounded groups, or even bounded bodies, is on unsettled ground. A cartography of borders simply calls attention to the crossings, linkages and border-dwellings that have always constituted unstable and ever-changing worlds. Aug\u00e9 continues in the same line of thinking, \u201cfor a start, it works well\u2014or rather, it has worked well: land has been cultivated, nature domesticated, reproduction of the generations ensured; in this sense the gods of the soil have looked after it well\u201d (46); but then, \u201cit is also a semi-fantasy because, although nobody doubts the reality of the place held in common and the powers that threaten it or protect it, nobody is unaware\u2014nobody has ever been unaware\u2014of the reality of other groups\u201d (46\u201347).",

The old routes of trade, colonisation and settlement have morphed into criss-crossing jet streams of multinational corporate capital, global leisure tourism, and large-scale relocation of people due to political conflict and environmental devastation. Relatively slow border crossings by boat, train, or foot still occur of course, but these modes have largely been outstripped by growth in and the profile of air travel; for example, the high profile of asylum seeker arrivals by boat in Australia and southern Europe masks the far greater number that arrive by plane.3 Ironically space travel has only recently gone commercial, with suborbital flights posing a viable money-maker for the new space tourism industry, just as concern over peak oil suggests that the days of jet plane travel are limited. Virtual journeys through the nerve centres of the internet and other telecommunications channels are conducted in their trillions each day as people attend meetings via Skype halfway around the globe, capital is moved from one account to another, and virtual worlds are constructed and traversed by our avatars.",

More recently, what political sociologist Mark Salter has called the \u201ctwin stars\u201d of globalisation and the war on terror have brought about considerable resurgence of critical scholarship on the subject of airports. Long the domain of aviation law and safety, or terminal logistics and management, there is a growing literature from within humanities and the social sciences concerned with airports as, for example, political sites of surveillanceand control (Salter 2008; Hall 2011, 2015), as complex global networks and \u201c flow machines\u201d (Fuller and Harley 2004), as modulators of affect\n(Adey 2007, 2008a, b, 2009), and as settings for a new \u201c aeromobility\nhabitus\u201d or a new widespread \u201cwill to fly\u201d (Cwerner 2009). As well, the lingering nostalgia for a lost glamour in air travel makes for appealing cultural histories such as Alastair Gordon\u2019s Naked Airport (2004), with its documentation of the changing characters of air travel and the development of airport buildings from the muddy airfield to today\u2019s \u201cpterodactyl of glass and steel\u201d (28). Working well beyond the airport as metaphor for empty transnational privilege or as metonym for exotic faraway places, this body of research complements a broader critical scholarship on cosmopolitanism and globalisation.",

            "text": "While Aug\u00e9 defines non-places like the airport against what he calls anthropological\nplace, I argue that close study of movement in the airport actually disturbs this binary rubric through which the cultural practice of place/space is understood, thereby challenging both the negative casting of mobility by the proponents of fixed place and also the utopic untethering of place by those extolling the freedoms of mobility. Airports are not simply empty of the ideals of meaning and attachment, but rather place and non-place\u2019s separate logics operate in circumstances that are not mutually exclusive. Hence, for example, the formation of subjectivities such as \u201cthird culture kids\u201d (TCKs), a subculture of people who grew up in two or more cultures under highly mobile (generally expatriate rather than migratory) conditions, who might feel resonantly \u201cat home\u201d in the airport.5 The distinction between place and space is often a valuation between a place of meaningful dwelling and the spatial void, and this binary comparison extends to spaces of mobility or non-places. For Aug\u00e9, the \u201cdistinction between places and non-placesderives from the opposition between place and space\u201d (1995, 79). \u201cPlace, as defined here,\u201d he argues, \u201cis place in the established and symbolized sense, anthropological place\u201d (81). Aug\u00e9\u2019s influential book examines airports, along with other increasingly common, late-capitalist spaces such as supermarkets, motorways, and ATMs. Together, these are delineated by Aug\u00e9 as places formed by the logic of transport, transit and commerce, and through relations of solitary contractuality (94).",

He is on the way to the airport where he parks (row J, underground level 2), checks in his allotted twenty kilos, passes through passport control before doing some duty-free shopping, and finally boards: \u201c Waitingfor take-off, while newspapers were being distributed, he glanced through the company\u2019s in-flight magazine and ran his finger along the imagined route of the journey: Heraklion, Larnaca, Beirut, Dhahran, Dubai, Bombay, Bangkok \u2026 more than nine thousand kilometres in the blink of an eye\u201d; Dupont perused the duty-free list, \u201cand read with a certain smugness the advantages conferred by the \u2018business class\u2019 in which he was travelling thanks to the intelligent generosity of his firm.\u201d Enjoying his fancy \u201cEspace 2000\u201d seat and the advertisements in a magazine, he settles into the flight (3\u20134).",

            "text": "Overall this book revisits Marc Aug\u00e9\u2019s twenty-year-old binary, but argues that global airports operate in a more negotiated middle ground. Using the concept of thirdspace as outlined by cultural theorist Homi Bhabha, and as developed later by geographer Edward Soja , I instead argue that there is a more complex, contested negotiation going on between old ideas of place and the spaces of globalisationand transit at the airport. Thirdspaceas discussed by both Bhabha and Soja designates a non-fixed zone in which intercultural formations might come into being, but it is also designed as a critical apparatus, a way of thinking via Bhabha\u2019s \u201cand/also\u201d or \u201cthirding-as-othering\u201d in order to restructure binary oppositions, or in Bhabha\u2019s words, \u201celude the politics of polarity\u201d (1994, 56). How this critical mode of thinking might live up to or map onto physical space as well as embodied cultural practiceis one of the things I take up in the next and following chapters. The mutual entanglement of matter and meaning\u2014of mattering\u2014is one of the crucial methodological and theoretical imperatives here. More than only a heuristic, my study tests the limits of place, non-place, thirdspace rubrics by reinstating the visceral body to accounts of the lived experience of air travel. Is it really all breezy easiness, as Pierre Dupont would have us believe?",

They operate as global cities in \u201ca geography of strategic places at the global scale\u201d (Sassen 2002, 161). They are networked to other global city-airports more than to other places within their immediate locality (see also Sassen 2001).

Moving away from an association of cosmopolitanism with elite transnational mobility, authors such as Gilbert and Lo participate in establishing a more critical discourse that does not over-valorise the possibilities for cultural flows and exchange, and remains wary of \u201cpopulist postmodern theory\u201d that poses that everyone is on the move and/or that we are all in some way tourists (Bharucha 2000, 7). Here Peng Cheah\u2019s critique of blind faith in global cosmopolitanism remains particularly incisive:If we recall that the nation is a mass-based imagined political community, it is unclear whether in the current interstate system, the so-called international public sphere or global civil society (names for mass-based global political communities) formed by transnational networks can achieve social redistribution on a global scale if it does not go through the institutional agency of the nation-state.

This is the airport\u2019s nowhere/anywhere modality, what Arjun Appadurai and Carol Breckenridge call the \u201cdisturbing commercial sameness\u201d of cosmopolitan cultural forms (1998, 5). But in our actual journeys in aeroplanes, through airports\u2014through the terminal, onto the plane, through customs and security checks, in the food hall, long waits in the gate lounge\u2014our movements play a part in constituting more ambiguous and particular bodily experiences of global flow as well. One of the reasons the airport as physical and conceptual space presents as an interesting site of study is that a tangle of relations between nationalisms and cosmopolitanisms,interculturalisms, and transculturalisms is encountered again and again. Arriving in the international terminal at Sydney\u2019s Kingsford Smith airport, we are forced to pass through a last-minute duty-free shopping centre just before customs. During busy early morning arrivals traffic, the line for passport control often backs up into the shopping area\u2014an ideal model of the airport\u2019s peddling of \u201ccommercial sameness\u201d if ever there was, just as the state is most strongly enforcing the weightof its jurisdiction. At Vancouver\nInternational, on the other hand, we descend into border control by passing through two large Coast Salish carvings, employed as citation of place in a practice akin to the strategies of museum display. The carvings mark your \u201carrival,\u201d but where you arrived is a complex of nation, First Nation, city, and nowhere\u2014for let us remember, that until you pass through passport control, you have not really yet arrived in a geo-legal sense.",

I stayed in airport hotels, and boarding gate lounges. I went on a \u201ctarmac tour\u201d and visited the Qantas \u201cheritage museum.\u201d I boarded, took off, set down, and deplaned numerous times. I hung about in border control as long as I could without raising suspicion. I went to meet people at the airport, and I went to just watch people meeting people at the airport. I was checked in. I was scanned. I flew. I queued. I transferred. I waited. I fell asleep, I waited. I wrote. I recollected travel memories along an expanded timeline, augmenting my dedicated fieldwork with past experiences such as those that opened the book\u2019s prologue. Together these notes form a kind of personal journey; one that represents my lifeworld as someone who is mixed-race, a dual national, a woman, an ex-dancer, a designer, and now an academic with First World mobility\u2014a \u201cthird culture kid\u201d of sorts: an Australian, an American, of Asian and Anglo descent, currently residing in Australia in the Asian century. My world is a potent representative of the legacy of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European colonialismstill in effect through the world, of shifts in international relations towards the USA in the twentieth, and of the new globalising forces of capitalist trade that are pulling us all in realignment towards the Pacific rim of Asia, just as my near neighbours in the South Pacific begin to go under water. This is not to say that my lifeworld is in some way representative of everyone\u2019s experience, far from it; but it is not in broad terms uncommon either. My field notes therefore attempt, in the tradition of radical empiricism, to capture deeply observed qualitative information on lived experience from within the world that constructs (and is constructed by) that experience. Through my fieldwork I visited airports in China, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand/Aotearoa, Canada, the USA, the UK, and continental Europe; traversing hemispheres both North and South, East and West. This is in fact where the \u201cAustralia\u201d and \u201cHawai\u2019i\u201d of my opening story could be located, if anywhere: somewhere between North and South, East and West. I would not call this book an ethnography per se, but it owes a debt to the methods and frameworks of ethnography, working from participant observation, towards field notes, and towards interpretation and meaning. My focus has been explicitly on movement experience, and therefore, if I could call the study\u2019s methodology any one thing, I would call it a kind of kinaesthetic ethnography\n.",

Indeed the idea of \u201cfield\u201d itself as a bounded site in large part defined by virtue of its distance from an equally delineated \u201chome\u201d is called into question. Instead, fieldwork could be a \u201cseries of travel encounters\u201d (2) or a \u201ctravel practice\u201d (8), or as \u201cno more than where the action is\u201d (Hall 2009, 572; after Erving Goffman, original emphasis), potentially untying the site from a fixed and located ground. Methodological questions of place and time are also important epistemological ones for the project: unfixing \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d promotes my focus upon often non-centred, non-stable modes of subjectivity and lived experience that are produced in transnational and intercultural forums. Such a focus has emerged from my observations of the global airport and air travel, but it has also followed from my goal to take seriously the sensing body and particularly the movement-sensing body. That the global spaces of the airport compose contingent, slightly \u201coff\u201d or slightly \u201cout,\u201d ways of being in and with, is the major assertion of this book. From the scanningprocedures of security, to the presentation of self and identitydocuments at the border, to the visceral effects of jet lag, and the interminable waitingin terminals, I am brought into a new relationship to myself, to my own potential for being different or new or, dare I say, being other.

The disciplinary lens of performance and dance is something that is from the outset evident in my work, but the lifetime of somatic training of proprioceptive, temporal, spatial, sonic, and other bodily systems utilised in making and attending to movement in space and time also means that I am a certain kind of body in the world.",

In terms of the study of performance, the spectator bias is dominant. It often places the researcher as a disembodied watcher sitting in the dark of the theatre or rehearsal room, focussed on the performance, a \u201cshow,\u201d and cut off from the myriad of processes that shape what is being watched. I have previously argued that in terms of cultural performance in particular, the spectator approach tends to reify culturally identified performers into representations of fixed cultures, and within this paradigm it is difficult to account for non-representational practices such as contemporary dance (Shih Pearson 2012). Rather, I argue, it is through close attention to the perceptual experiences\u2014joyful and difficult\u2014involved in embodied cultural or intercultural practice,through the body in practice, we will unavoidably get to a politics of cultural interaction.",

Along with Jackson, I am not here arguing for a higher epistemological status for practice; but rather, the focus that I employ on embodied practice follows my interest in the embodied practiceof cosmopolitanism.Lived experience overflows the boundaries of any one concept, any one person, or any one society. As such, it brings us to a dialectical view of life which emphasizes the interplay rather than the identity of things, which denies any sure steading to thought by placing it always within the precarious and destabilizing fields of history, biography, and time.[\u2026] Lived experience accommodates our shifting sense of ourselves as subjects and as objects, as acting upon and being acted upon by the world, of living with and without certainty, of belonging and being estranged, yet resists arresting any one of these modes of experience in order to make it foundational to a theory of knowledge. Such an all-encompassing conception of experience avoids narrowing down the field of experience to either the subject or the object, theory or practice, the social or the individual, thought or feeling, form or flux (Jackson 1989, 2; original emphasis).\n",

The phenomenological tradition provides one way of thinking through embodiment as \u201clived body\u201d (leib), as \u201cthe lived fact of experiencing the world from and in and with just this body, my body\u201d (Casey 1996, 23). This approach, as Jackson has said, slightly tongue-in-cheek, calls into question \u201cthe longstanding division in Western discourse between the knowledge of philosophers or scientists and the opinions of ordinary mortals\u201d (1996, 7). Reducing the lived body to an object or product of discourse, as Edward Casey argues has happened in poststructuralist thought, reduces it to \u201ca paper-thin textual entity\u201d (1996, 37). My own reading of embodiment is indebted to Casey\u2019s work in bringing together Merleau-Ponty and the concept of habitus, first used by Marcel Mauss in his lecture \u201cTechniques of the Body\u201d in 1934 to describe \u201cphysio-psycho-sociological assemblages of series of actions\u201d (1973, 85) and later taken up and insightfully developed by Pierre Bourdieu. Casey\u2019s argument for an understanding of embodiment as a conjoining or \u201ccoimplication\u201d of natural and cultural bodies suggests that the cultural \u201carises around the natural, the social around the somatic instead of upon or over it [\u2026]\u201d (1996, 36; original emphasis). Habitus is also the \u201cmediatrix\u201d Casey asserts, between self and place (2001, 718).",

He argued that Husserlian methods of reduction or bracketing of previously held assumptions about the world in order to return to \u201cthe things themselves\u201d overlooks the extent to which experience is constrained by internalised social structures and fails to account for the non-intentional somatic dispositions explained by his concept of habitus (Throop and Murphy 2002, 190).7 Indeed, notions of bracketing and getting back to primary perception within phenomenology are difficult to reconcile with a project engaged in cultural work. But Jackson argues that habitus is directly comparable to the phenomenological notion of lifeworld (1996, 20), that domain of \u201ceveryday, immediate social existence and practical activity, with all its habituality, its crises, its vernacular and idiomatic character, its biographical particularities, its decisive events and indecisive strategies\u201d (7\u20138). As Jackson notes following Adorno\u2019s critique of the essentialising nature of Husserl and Heidegger\u2019s work, there can be no such thing as \u201cpure\u201d intuition, because our actions are always informed by the social and cultural claims upon us, made by our particular lifeworld (18). Rather, humans experience themselves as both subjects and objects, \u201cmaking us feel sometimes that we are world-makers, sometimes that we are merely made by the world\u201d (21).",

This opposition, she argues, is typified by the viewpoints of David Howes and Tim Ingold. Ingold, influenced by Western philosophers of perception (i.e. Merleau-Ponty) and psychologists (e.g. Gibson), argues that sensation should be understood as \u201corgans of the body as a whole\u201d; while Howes argues such an approach ignores \u201cthe sensesin social context,\u201d that is, borrowing a term from Steven Feld, how the sensesare \u201cculturally attuned\u201d (Ingold and Howes in Pink 2009, n.p.). As Pink goes on to argue, and Bourdieu also reminds us, bodily action is not just the reproduction of a cultural template; although we carry this, we also venture forth in the world to meet each circumstance with the creativity and possibility that our body affords us. Bourdieu\u2019s notion of habitus itself allows for a way of thinking about the body as simultaneously social and physical; it is a mediating link between several seemingly dichotomous dualisms (structure and agency, social and individual, objective and subjective).",

Dance scholar Andr\u00e9 Lepecki claims that \u201crethinking the subject in terms of the body is precisely the task of choreography\u201d (2006, 5). Andrew Hewitt\u2019s \u201csocial choreography\u201dis aimed directly at thinking about the relationship of aesthetics to politics in a way that poses dance or choreographyas a structuring and affecting of the social order. In so doing Hewitt critiques undialectical assumptions of \u201cthe body\u201d as materiality\u2014a text to be read\u2014 asking, \u201ccan I still experience something? Can I produce an artifact? In other words, are we to think of the \u2018work\u2019 of art as noun or verb, as artifact or activity?\u201d (2005, 25). Susan Leigh Foster (2011) argues that choreographycan be theorised as a conceptualisation of corporeal, individual, and social identity, able to \u201ccontest the reception of danceas the presentation of a kind of spectacle without a history or methodology for engaging with the physical\u201d (4). Foster\u2019s book Choreographing Empathy undertakes a comprehensive genealogy of the term (along with kinaesthesia and empathy), and such a project points to the wide deployment but also critical possibility the term choreographyholds to recognise \u201cthe specific and intensive physical commitment that any body must invest in order to ground itself in the world\u201d (72).",

Not all dancing, however, aims towards flow. What kind of moving (or stillness) is happening is of concern to the dancer and dancewatcher. Anna Pakes describes watching a dancer improvise:She begins in silence and stillness, but gradually, in response to murmurings on the sound-score starts to move in a slow, controlled way. She initiates movement in the extremities of the fingers and feet, a series of impulses that pass through the limbs and joints to the body\u2019s core. As her centre engages, she moves more quickly and travels more expansively, her gestures becoming more complex and ambitious\u2014until a moment when she feels herself falling into a familiar pattern in which she merely reiterates a sequence that seems to come automatically. The dancer makes the decision to fracture this sequence, break its apparently organic flow by unexpectedly leading movement from the elbow in a new direction. Realising also that her dynamic has become monotonous in a series of flurries of movement of about the same duration, she makes the effort to sustain certain phrases for longer and, ultimately, calm everything down to return to the virtual stillness from which she began.

These bodily practices tend to recede from awareness, and on one end of the spectrum are seen as the regulatory limits conditioning socialised subjects within a certain field.8 Perhaps the most common example is that of classical ballet training. Dancerswork to elongate arm and leg extensions and necks, institute preferences for \u201clightness\u201d in relation to gravity and ground, certain ideas of \u201cbeauty,\u201d and expectations of binary gender. This training, unlike the training we acquire in everyday life, might be entered into knowingly and voluntarily, but the reproduction of that bodily practice at a certain point ceases to become an act of will. In fact, the ballet schema is one that is famously hard to \u201ctake off\u201d even when the dancerreturns to everyday life.9 Changed approaches to practice within contemporary dancesince the twentieth century, on the other hand, speak to the trained bodily awareness that allows for innovative kinaesthetic authorship. These two radically different ideas of practice\u2014one, the covert ways in which we come to embody history, and socio-cultural rules and expectations, and the other, overt training to sharpen consciousness in order to find new movement; one, a practice that aligns us to a distinct collective, and the other, a practice in order to assert uniqueness\u2014are both at work within the choreographic endeavour.

Reflected through the \u201c new mobilities paradigm\u201d identified by Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006) this binary becomes a polarity between stasis and movement. Place has mostly been associated with dwelling and \u201chome,\u201d in turn given what Doreen Massey calls \u201ctotemic resonance\u201d (2005, 5) against the threat of homogenising flows brought by globalisation. Thus place-space, stasis-movement, become associated with fears for cultural preservation in the face of cultural absorption into the global. Connected to the broader spatial turn in the social sciences and humanities, Sheller and Urry\u2019s designation of the new mobilities paradigmwas both a descriptive response to a world \u201con the move,\u201d and also part of a larger theoretical project to upset a \u201csedentarist\u201d social science (2006, 208). These authors point out that, \u201cissues of movement, of too little movement or too much, or of the wrong sort or at the wrong time, are central to many lives and many organisations\u201d (ibid.). In other words, the new mobilities paradigm is inherently critical of a discourse that \u201ctreats as normal stability, meaning, and place, and treats as abnormal distance, change, and placelessness\u201d (ibid.). The call for greater attention to the study of movement in everyday life is indeed a logical response to the proliferation of mobility in the twenty-first century as described in the beginning of this chapter, however, it also entrenches a particular polarity. That is, a romantic ideal of groundedness, dwelling, and continuous attachment inherited from classical anthropology on one side, and an equal romanticisation of networks, contingencies and flows on the other.10\n",

To this end, she insists that both macro and micro approaches to recording movement are necessary, allowing for the more common profiling of migratory patterns within a complex network of routes (what she calls \u201cmacro-migratory charting\u201d (81)) as well as recording of the small-scale motion that happens within nodes in the network, at the level of individual experience (a \u201ccultural \u2018 kinesphere\u2019\u201d after Rudolf Laban ). It is this micro-level analysis that shows how motile practicesand experiences, not just places, have meaning-making capability (84).

The original system is highly complex, or \u201crich\u201d as Laban\u2019s followers would refer to it. Laban defined four categories of effort, in order to encompass the large variation in dynamic a similar configuration of movement could have: space, weight, time and flow. Each movement employs effort factors according to eight different elements configured as spectrums between two polarities: direct or indirect, strong or light, sudden or sustained, bound or free. He also developed a system for body shape: in terms of direction or facing, how shapes change, in relation to static shapes, and in relation to the way a movement might, for example, rise or extend or retreat. Irmgard Bartenieff, one of Laban\u2019s students, contributed work on structural and physical characteristics of the moving body referred to as the Bartenieff Fundamentals. This system is concerned with observing the initiation, relation and organisation of movement between parts of the body and between bodies, and involves specific exercises designed to train the use of breath, hip flexion, pelvic shifts, bilateral and contralateral segmentation and coordination, among others.",

This distinction is less clear within my study\u2014experiences of both mobility and motilityare obviously pertinent to travel in the airport, in a space where various movements are endured and enjoyed in equal (or perhaps unequal) measure, and where the more abstract notion of global flows are met by intimate acts of bodily motion.

In assessing the \u201cstill-acts\u201d or \u201cnon-dance\u201d dominating experimental dancein the 1990s, Lepecki uses Arbeau\u2019s text to argue that the ontology of choreography is not disappearance (as Peggy Phelan famously argued of performance more generally), nor modernity\u2019s \u201cobsessive march forwards\u201d (Cresswell 2012, 42), but a mode of presence/presencing.",

Presence and movement are actually implicated within one another through the socio-political: ideology is \u201cwritten\u201d upon the body (or within the its cells and tissues) and manifests outwards towards the world through the body\u2019s movements, whether intentionally crafted through choreographic style in the case of art dance, or as second-nature techniques of bodily practice in the case of everyday movement. The deeply investigated kinaesthetic labour of the professional choreographer,however, can help us to understand the material labour that often masquerades as second nature within everyday social practice. It is this material manifestation that leads Laurence Louppe to argue for an appraisal of the materiality of the body itself as dance\u2019s inescapable proposition. Louppe refers to danceas the \u201cdouble-presence\u201d of dancer and spectator, \u201can experience/experiment of perceiving in space and time, an undergoing of this experience\u2014on both sides\u201d (2010, 5). As the study of factors eliciting affective response, her poetic approach seeks \u201cto observe not only the finished product but the production at work in the work\u201d (6).

Asking not how the airport is like performance (i.e. theatrical performance), I rather use performance as a means to look at the world in new and useful ways. My project is not designed as a comparative study aimed at general conclusions about airport architecture or behaviour; rather, my focus is towards bodily experiences of in-betweenness through constructions of social space, of which airports but are one such location.

I am focussing on how the airport might be conditioning spaces, bodies, or subjectivities, not through rupture with the everyday (the migrant narrative, an in-between discourse which situates the refugeeat the very crisis spot mid-migration), but through the embodied practice of everyday moves. In the spirit of particularised cosmopolitanism with which I began this chapter, however, it is important to note that my experience cannot speak for all bodies everywhere.

Without emptying the discussion of a politics of intercultural practice, the following chapters attempt to arrive somewhere different by beginning from the perspective of embodied experiences of movement. While the focus on practical cosmopolitanism as a process of movement might seem to propose a radically alternate model of cosmopolitanism, at the same time, I see it as a simple extension of the argument against static and fixed notions of culture that has been developing in the humanities and social sciences going on a quarter century.",

However, within (not against) these features, the airport also exerts particularities of nation, region and locale, and the ways in which nation and cosmos, local and global, particular and general interact are often odd or even paradoxical.

Increased security screening procedures have proliferated in airports across the Western world, particularly in the USA and the UK, in response to twenty-first century terrorist strategies.

By choreographyI mean the patterns and directions of people moving through terminal spaces, but I also mean what experiences, affective and embodied, these movements imbue, and what subjectivities they presence . Is it possible that by encountering our own capacity for difference, for the new, for dwelling in indeterminacy, for undergoing visceral rearrangements, for being with others and for being other, we might awaken to a more empathetic response to difference in general? Both nationalism and internationalism have, in turn, been promoted as roads to Utopia, and yet the world we find ourselves in struggles on with gross inequity and suffering. The enduring questions of how to live on this globe, with others on the globe, in tolerance of the difference that proliferates are still difficult and pressing ones. The body cannot be sovereign. It is always at sea in the wash of sociality; we are made by being in the world that we bring into being, with others.
