Natural antimicrobial compounds are produced in various parts of the plants e.g., fl owers, buds, fruits, seeds, herbs, roots, leaves, bark, wood, and stem, coinciding with the various assaults that the plant might encounter in the environment (Burt 2004 ) . The fragrance of plants is carried in the quinta essential, or essential oil fraction (Cowan 1999 ) . These volatile oils are aromatic, viscous liquids (Burt 2004 ) that are complex mixtures of lipophilic and volatile secondary metabolites such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and/or phenylpropanoids. They are primarily responsible for a plant's fragrant and biological properties (Reichling et al. 2009 ).",

The composition can change depending on the geographical location, the soil, and even the season, leading to the biosynthesis of different metabolites. The active ingredient is often the dominant component, at times accounting for greater than 50 % of its chemical composition (Burt 2004 ) . For instance, the carvacrol content of oregano oil may be as high as 85 % and the cinnamaldehyde content of cinnamon oil as high as 86 %, depending on their geographical origin (Ravishankar et al. 2009 ). Lemongrass oil contains multiple components including citral (57.5 %), citral diethylacetal (24.7 %), limonene (6.4 %), citral acetate (2.1 %), myrcene (1.2 %), and methyl heptenone (1.2 %) (Katsukawa et al. 2010 ) . Eugenol is the primary active component in both clove bud oil (up to 85 %) (Farag et al. 1989 ; Bauer et al. 2001 ) and allspice oil (Takemasa et al. 2009 ) and accounts for their antioxidant properties (Ogata et al. 2000 ; Takemasa et al. 2009 ).",

Saponins are naturally occurring glycosides that may exhibit antimicrobial, hemolytic, membrane depolarizing, cholesterol binding, and allopathic activities (Naidu 2000 ) . Thiosulfi nates are related to garlic, which has been used as a medicinal plant since antiquity and possesses both static and cidal effects against microbes (Naidu 2000 ) . Glucosinolates are bioactive compounds found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli (Naidu 2000 ) . Terpenoids are secondary metabolites and are highly enriched in compounds based on an isoprene structure (Cowan 1999 ) . Citral is a type of terpenoid that causes bacterial membrane disruption and the leakage of intracellular ions. Its action on the cell membrane also has dramatic effects on proton motive forces, intracellular ATP content, and the overall cell activity (Somolinos et al. 2010 ) .",

The phenols and polyphenols are a group of bioactive chemicals which consist of a single substituted phenolic ring (Cowan 1999 ) ; different compounds vary in their C6 ring structure. In general, phenols or polyphenols exhibit the greatest antimicrobial efficacy of various plant origin compounds (Burt 2004 ) . The antioxidant activity may occur via mechanisms such as scavenging of radicals and chelating of metal ions. The phenol, eugenol, reportedly participates in photochemical reactions (Mihara and Shibamoto 1982 ) and inhibits the production (Farag et al. 1989 ) and activity of enzymes (Wendakoon and Sakaguchi 1995 ) . It may also cause changes in membrane permeability resulting from the exit of potassium ions (Walsh et al. 2003 ) . Cell wall deterioration and lysis have also been observed (Thoroski et al. 1989 ).",

( 2011 ) investigated the antiviral effi cacy of star anise essential oil (consisting of about 80 % of the phenylpropanoid, trans-anethole) as well as several other plant phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes (trans-anethole, eugenol, \u03b2-eudesmol, farnesol, \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b2-caryophyllene oxide) against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The antimicrobials were added to HSV-1 prior to cell infection and also after the viruses were already infecting cells. Star anise oil was the most effective, inhibiting viral infectivity by >99 %, followed by \u03b2-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene (98 % inhibition). Trans-anethole and farnesol inhibited HSV-1 infectivity by >90 %. The other compounds reduced the cell infectivity by 60-90 %. Koch et al. ( 2008 ) observed similar inhibitory effects of anise oil as well as oils from thyme, hyssop, ginger, chamomile, and sandalwood on herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). In another study, 12 essential oils (e.g., tea tree, cypress, juniper, tropical basil, peppermint, marjoram, eucalyptus, ravensara, lavender, lemon, rosemary, and lemongrass oils) were tested against HSV-1. A 1 % concentration of these oils completely inhibited virus infectivity but had no effect on intracellular virus. Lemongrass oil was the most effective, completely inhibiting virus infectivity at a concentration of 0.1 % (Minami et al. 2003 ) . In a study by Armaka et al. ( 1999 ) , a 1 % concentration of isoborneol, a monoterpenoid alcohol and a component of several plant essential oils, showed virucidal activity against HSV-1 (~4-log 10 reduction in cell culture infectivity) within 30 min of exposure.",

( 2010a ) examined the effi cacy of cranberry juice and cranberry proanthocyanidins (PAC) on enteric virus surrogates: murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1), feline calicivirus F9 (FCV-F9), MS2 (a ssRNA bacteriophage), and \u03a6X174 (a ssDNA bacteriophage). MNV-1 was reduced by 2.06-log 10 PFU/ml with cranberry juice, and 2.63-log 10 PFU/ml with 0.15 mg/ml PAC. FCV-F9 was undetectable after exposure to both cranberry juice and 0.15 mg/ml PAC. MS2 titers were reduced by 1.14-log 10 with cranberry juice and by 0.96-log 10 PFU/ml with 0.60 mg/ml PAC. \u03a6X174 titers were reduced by 1.79-log 10 with cranberry juice and by 4.98-log 10 PFU/ml with 0.60 mg/ml PAC. Neutralizing the pH of the cranberry juice did not diminish the antiviral effect. also evaluated pomegranate juice and pomegranate phenolic extracts (PPE) against FCV-F9, MNV-1, and MS2 phage. After 20 min of exposure to pomegranate juice, reductions of 3.1-and 0.8-log 10 of FCV-F9 and MNV-1 infectivity, respectively, were observed. A 4 mg/ml concentration of PPE resulted in slightly higher reductions of 5.1-and 1.1-log 10 of the two viruses, respectively, following 20 min of exposure. Neither pomegranate juice nor PPE was effective against MS2 phage after 20 min. Elizaqu\u00edvel et al. ( 2013 ) studied the antiviral effi cacy of clove, oregano, and zataria essential oils against the human norovirus (HuNoV) surrogates, FCV-F9 and MNV-1 at 4 and 37 \u00b0C. Concentrations of 2 % oregano oil, 1 % clove oil, and 0.1 % zataria oil were less effective at 4 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C. At 4 \u00b0C, MNV-1 titers were reduced by 0.6-, 0.8-, and 1.0-log 10 , respectively, while reductions of 1.6-, 0.7-, and 0.3-log 10 were observed at 37 \u00b0C. The oils were not effective against FCV-F9 at 4 \u00b0C (\u22640.25-log 10 reduction) but were highly effective at 37 \u00b0C (3.8-, 3.8-, and 4.5-log 10 reductions for oregano, clove, and zataria oils, respectively). Gilling et al. ( 2014a ) examined the effects of oregano oil and its primary antimicrobial component, carvacrol, against MNV-1. Both antimicrobials caused statistically signifi cant reductions ( P \u2264 0.05) in cell culture infectivity within 15 min of exposure (~1.0-log 10 ). Despite this, the MNV-1 infectivity remained stable over time with exposure to oregano oil (1.07-log 10 after 24 h), while carvacrol was far more effective, producing up to 3.87-log 10 reductions within 1 h of exposure and >4.15-log 10 after 3 h. In a separate study, allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral (a component of lemongrass oil) were moderately effective against MNV-1, producing signifi cant reductions of 0.9-1.88-log 10 ) after 6 h (Gilling et al. 2014b ) .",

Koch et al. ( 2008 ) also found similar results for cell infectivity with oils from anise, thyme, hyssop, ginger, chamomile, and sandalwood with HSV-2. In addition, they found that pretreatment of the host cells with essential oils did not prevent viral infection. Minami et al. ( 2003 ) reported that 12 essential oils (tea tree, cypress, juniper, tropical basil, peppermint, marjoram, eucalyptus, ravensara, lavender, lemon, rosemary, and lemongrass oils) completely inhibited HSV-1 cell culture infectivity but had no effect on intracellular viruses. Isoborneol, a component of several plant essential oils, caused approximately a 4-log 10 reduction in HSV-1 cell culture infectivity and specifi cally inhibited the glycosylation of viral proteins but did not appear to prevent virus adsorption to the cells (Armaka et al. 1999 ) . Likewise, the plant sesquiterpene triptofordin C-2 did not appear to prevent HSV-1 adsorption to host cells (Hayashi et al. 1996 ) . Two phytocompounds, betulinic acid and savinin, were shown to have antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV. Both compounds exhibited protease inhibition and appeared to inhibit post-binding entry of the virus into cells (Wen et al. 2007 ) . Ocazionez et al. ( 2010 ) found that exposure to essential oils from L. alba and L. citriodora was effective against DENV when applied 2 h prior to cell adsorption, but no effect was observed for viruses already located within the host cells. In another study, essential oils from L. alba, L. origanoides , O. vulgare , and A. vulgaris were effective against YFV; however, no reductions were observed when the cells were treated with essential oils prior to virus adsorption (Meneses et al. 2009 ) indicating that a different antimicrobial mechanism was operating against this virus. The essential oil from Mexican oregano ( Lippia graveolens ) inhibited HSV-1 (acyclovir resistant and sensitive strains), HRSV, and BHV-2 both before and after virus inoculation while carvacrol (its primary active component) caused inhibition only after virus inoculation (Pilau et al. 2011 ) . Jackwood et al. ( 2010 ) treated avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) (an enveloped coronavirus) with oleoresins and essential oils from botanicals in a liquid emulsion product [QR448(a)]. The anti-AIBV activity was greater prior to virus attachment, indicating that the effect is likely directly virucidal; however, treatment of the chickens prevented symptoms but not infection for 4 days following treatment and also decreased the transmission of the virus (Jackwood et al. 2010 ) .",

            "text": "Recent studies have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of action of plant antimicrobials (essential oils and extracts or their components) against nonenveloped viruses. The protein capsid in non-enveloped viruses serves to protect the viral nucleic acid and to initiate infection by facilitating virus adsorption to the host cells (Cliver 2009 ). In a review by Cliver ( 2009 ) , it was found that antimicrobials and other treatments that inactivate small enteric viruses [caliciviruses (e.g., HuNoV, MNV-1, and FCV-F9), picornaviruses (e.g., PV-1, EV-9, CV-B1), hepatitis viruses (e.g., HAV), and astroviruses], act on the virus capsid to some extent; in many cases, the viral RNA is unaffected though the virus is no longer infectious. B\u00fafalo et al. ( 2009 ) studied the effects of plant Baccharis dracunculifolia (extract and essential oil), Brazilian propolis (the resinous substance produced by honeybees from this plant), and caffeic and cinnamic acids against PV-1. They found that treatment with the antimicrobials at the same time as exposure to the host cells was more effective than treatment after the viruses were inside the cells. In a study by Semple et al. ( 2001 ) , chrysophanic acid (an anthraquinone) from the Australian Aboriginal medicinal plant Dianella longifolia inhibited PV-2 and PV-3 induced cytopathic effects in BGM cells. The antimicrobial appeared to work best when added during or immediately following virus adsorption to the cells, suggesting that it acted early during the poliovirus replication cycle. In a study by Felipe et al. ( 2006 ) , crude extracts from Guazuma ulmifolia (mutumba) and Stryphnodendron adstringens stem bark (barbatim\u00e3o) inhibited PV-1 replication in infected cells. In another study, T4 bacteriophage was incapable of adsorbing to its bacterial host cells after exposure to cranberry juice (as visualized under scanning and transmission electron microscopy) (Lipson et al. 2007 ) .",

Treatment of FCV-F9 with cranberry juice and cranberry proanthocyanidins revealed structural changes in virus particles; they appeared to be damaged under TEM (Su et al. 2010b ). Lipson et al.

For example, green tea extract could be used with lemons, limes, apples, and other fruits traditionally combined with both hot and cold tea drinks. Grape seed extract could be used on grapes, strawberries, raspberries, and other vine-based fruits. Many essential oils are derived from food products such as garlic and oregano that are commonly used in cuisines worldwide. Additionally, spices such as cinnamon and allspice are common fl avor additives used in foods. Efforts should be made to determine optimal olfactory/organoleptic combinations and to determine the lowest effective antimicrobial concentrations.
