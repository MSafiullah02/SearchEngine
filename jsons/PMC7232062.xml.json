In 2002 and 2003 CoVs were responsible of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2\u20136] and in 2012, of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [7, 8].

PRISMA guidelines were used for this systematic review [22]. Reference lists of identified articles were independently hand-searched by two authors (GGA, CG). Abstracts were examined, and if eligible, full texts and associated reference lists underwent further evaluation for eligibility. The search was then expanded using a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers, which, once identified, were also screened for accordance to our inclusion criteria. Authors were contacted when necessary. All the results were merged using the reference management software Mendeley (V.1.19.4, Mendeley Ltd). All publications were then reassessed by a third reviewer (FA). According to Cohen\u2019s Kappa, interrater agreement was excellent (\u03ba = 1). Notably, though the majority of publications on COVID-19 are from Asia, no language restrictions were imposed, in order to minimize language bias. Due to the scant evidence, both original articles, editorials, letters, and reviews providing evidence (i.e., prevalence, anecdotal report) about SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions were all included in the study. In addition, both published and unpublished papers were examined in our analysis, but we excluded ongoing clinical studies as for unobtainable conclusive results. To assess risk of bias and quality of primary studies or systematic reviews identified from database searches, we used the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale for cohort studies, the highest score on which is 9 points [23]. After extensive discussion among reviewers, we decided to include also studies with high risk of bias. We did not register the systematic review protocol because we anticipated the paucity of available information on the subject and due to the urgency of the matter.",

Despite being fully gowned with protective coat and N95 mask, he was still infected and reported his first symptom being unilateral conjunctivitis, with subsequent fever and catarrhal symptoms 2\u20133 hours later. The latency period of a few hours from conjunctivitis to respiratory symptoms does not aide in the determination of the route of transmission, since the virus may have entered via the unshielded ocular surface and caused respiratory symptoms around the same time as conjunctivitis, but masking may also have been ineffective, and conjunctivitis was merely a manifestation of SARS-CoV2. It would be useful to further elucidate SARS-CoV-2 binding to the surface of ocular tissues. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on SARS-CoV-2 S protein/ACE2 receptor interaction [39]. Key proteins crucial to the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) have been widely described in many ocular structures, including the aqueous [40], the pigmented epithelium [41], and the retina [31, 42\u201345].",

Hence, it cannot be established whether SARS-CoV-2 only colonizes ocular structure or it is able to invade them, inducing conjunctivitis.",
