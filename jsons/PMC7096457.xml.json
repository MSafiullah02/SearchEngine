Patients with severe trauma are at risk of VTE, and in 25% of severely traumatised patients, coagulopathy occurs immediately after injury, resulting in a 5-fold increase in mortality2\u20136. The reported incidence of post-traumatic VTE ranges between 2.6% and 63% depending on factors including patients\u2019 characteristics (e.g., injury severity and injury pattern), type of VTE prevention used, sensitivity of the screening test, and other factors7\u201310. Prophylaxis of VTE is based mainly on physical therapy and chemotherapy11\u201314, and chemotherapy is more efficacious than physical therapy in terms of lowering the incidence of VTE15. Most studies of the incidence of VTE in post-traumatic patients include various patterns and severity of trauma, and it is difficult to estimate the true incidence of VTE in specific types of fractures or provide an optimal guideline for prophylaxis of VTE in this subgroup of patients16\u201318. Furthermore, identification of risk factors has proven useful in defining high-risk patients and corresponding prophylaxis appears mandatory for all trauma patients.",

There were significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of peripheral vascular disease in patients who had VTE compared to patients without VTE (31.1% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001). There were 28 cases of acetabulum fracture, 17 cases of pelvic bone fracture, 174 cases of femur fracture, 137 cases of tibia fracture, and 75 cases of ankle fracture (Table 2). Sixty-five patients had multiple fractures involving 2 or more anatomical locations. Forty-five patients (12.4%) were diagnosed with symptomatic VTE. DVT and PE occurred in 34 (9.4%) and 19 (5.2%) patients, and 8 patients (2.2%) were diagnosed with both DVT and PE. Twelve patients (3.3%) were diagnosed with VTE before definitive fixation surgery, and 3 of those were diagnosed as pulmonary embolism. These patients developed VTE on average 6.3 \u00b1 8.6 days from the date of injury. Thirty-three patients (9.1%) were diagnosed with a VTE that occurred after definitive fixation surgery, with the events occurring an average of 6.6 \u00b1 7.6 days after surgery, and 16 of those were diagnosed as pulmonary embolism. Thirteen patients (3.6%) were diagnosed with distal DVT, and 3 of those coexisted with PE. Thirteen patients (3.6%) were also diagnosed with proximal DVT, and 3 of those coexisted with PE. Eight patients (2.2%) were diagnosed to have both proximal and distal DVT in the same lower extremity, and 2 of those coexisted with PE.",

A gold standard for prophylaxis has yet to be identified. In a study by Stannard et al., although the incidence of VTE following chemotherapy alone was 13.4%, the incidence fell further to 8.7% when both drugs and mechanical methods were used23. However, application of a pneumatic compressive device in patients with corresponding lower extremity fractures may not be possible. Traditionally, orthopaedic surgeons have been concerned about the effects of VTE prophylaxis on perioperative bleeding, which can result in hematoma, infection and wound problems. There has also been a concern that patients at low risk of developing symptomatic VTE may receive excessive anticoagulation24. Accordingly, updated guidelines from both the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy have focused more on the safety of prophylactic agents and symptomatic and fatal VTE events25,26.",

            "text": "Knudson et al. identified 450,375 trauma patients and the risk factors associated with development of VTE27. They reported an age of over 40 years, a lower-extremity fracture more than 3 points in abbreviated injury scale (AIS), applying a ventilator for more than 3 days, a head injury more than 3 points in AIS, venous injury, and cases requiring major operative procedure as risk factors. Wahlsten et al. studied 57,619 trauma patients and found that the incidence of VTE was low following surgery for fractures distal to the knee, but the risk increased with the presence of risk factors including use of oral contraception by patients eighteen to fifty years of age, previous DVT, previous PE, coagulopathy, and peripheral artery disease28. Furthermore, Thorson et al. prescreened 534 trauma patients with a risk assessment profile, and reported that high-risk profile score and pelvic fracture with prolonged intervention are independent predictors for VTE development, despite thromboprophylaxis29. However, few studies have reported the association between VTE incidence and patient factors such as sex, BMI, and underlying disease in trauma patients with fractures. In the present study, a higher Charlson comorbidity index and a history of external fixator application were associated with increased VTE risk. Among conditions for Charlson comorbidity index scoring, there were significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of peripheral vascular disease in patients who had VTE compared to patients without VTE (31.3% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001), and this may have influenced the results. Among patients who had VTE, male sex, and above-the-knee fractures were associated with increased PE risk. It is noteworthy that patients who had external fixator application were associated with increased VTE risk, and a longer period of immobilization would have contributed to thrombus formation in the vessels4. For the PE risk, up to 40% of proximal DVTs have an association with PE, and above-the-knee fractures would have caused more injury to the proximal vein, leading to formation and emboli of the thrombus at a more proximal area30. It was surprising to find being male as a risk factor for PE. Several studies have assessed the relationship between sex and incidence of VTE, and found the VTE recurrence rate is consistently higher in men, suggesting that higher prevalence of PE-associated proximal DVT in men partly accounts for the higher VTE recurrence rate in men31,32. It is possible that the higher prevalence of PE-associated proximal DVT in men, as with above-the-knee fractures being a risk factor for PE, is associated with PE risk in patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, two different LMWHs were used as there was institutional formulary change in LMWH prophylaxis from Dalteparin to Enoxaparin. However, as effectiveness of Dalteparin and Enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after traumatic injury has been reported to be similar by numerous studies33\u201335, the effect of differing LMWH prophylaxis on VTE occurrence should have been minimal. In a study that included 5880 trauma patients, the VTE rate was 3.3/1000 days in the Enoxaparin period vs 3.8/1000 days in Dalteparin period proving similar prophylactic effect of both LMWHs in trauma patients33. Second, only patients eligible to use pharmacological anti-coagulation prophylaxis were enrolled. Patients with co-existing head, chest, or abdominal trauma requiring treatment were excluded from the study. The findings in our study cannot be generalised to severely traumatised patients with a high ISS or those requiring intensive-care unit hospitalization. Third, as this was a single-institution study, it may not reflect universal practices, and the number of patients assessed was relatively small, accounting for the low incidence of PE. Fourth, symptoms of VTE were subjectively assessed by the senior surgeon, and selection bias issue may be an issue. Fifth, it is not possible to directly compare the results between studies due to inhomogeneity in study populations, VTE prophylaxis, and detection methods. Finally, other factors including use of oral contraception, timing of weight bearing, and ankle mobilization were not thoroughly assessed.",

Patients received LMWH, either Enoxaparin or Dalteparin, via subcutaneous injection at a dose of 40 mg/day and 5000 units/day, respectively.

Multiple fractures were defined as fractures involving at least 2 locations. Because DVT in the pelvis and lower extremities proximal to the popliteal artery is the most frequent source of emboli in the pulmonary artery30, fracture location was further classified as proximal to the fracture in an area proximal to a knee joint (e.g., acetabulum, pelvis, and femur) and as distal when the fracture was limited to an area distal to a knee joint (e.g., tibia and ankle). The injury severity score (ISS) scale was used to represent the severity of the injuries, which were categorised as mild (<9), moderate (9\u201315), or severe (16\u201325)38. Gustilo open-fracture classification was used to grade open fractures39.
