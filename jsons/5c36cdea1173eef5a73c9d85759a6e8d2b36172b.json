Earlier on, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Public Health of England called for the general public not to wear masks unless they were ill. This well-intended recommendation was meant to discourage hoarding and creating an inadvertent shortage for those who needed it the most. Cultural preferences and a desire not to induce further panic in society also played a role in this policy. However, there are compelling arguments for universal masking [1] . Indeed, authorities are now backtracking and reconsidering their stance. The CDC has now (April 3, 2020) recommended that US citizens should wear cloth masks in public (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). Let us examine some of the reasons for this decision.",

            "text": "Surgical masks are designed to filter fomites emanating from the wearer, for example, in aseptic surgery for health care workers to preserve a sterile operating field. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that asymptomatic spreaders play an important role. Indeed, it has been shown that infected cases are infectious for a median of 2.5 days before symptoms appear and are most infectious just before symptom onset. Would universal masking help? Surgical masks are not air tight around the edges and are not specifically designed to protect the wearer from bioaerosols, unlike N95 respirators [2] . However, multiple studies have shown that they do still offer protection to the wearer. Despite not being air tight, a surgical mask filters out a significant portion of the virus from each inhaled breath [3] [4] [5] . The wearer is exposed to a significantly reduced infectious viral load (six times on average) and is less likely to get infected. Even in the situation that the wearer does unfortunately get infected, the severity of the illness is likely to be less, related to inoculum dose. In cases of influenza, it has been shown that illness severity is related to initial infectious load. While the same has not been proven for the SARS-COV-2 virus, it has been shown with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, making it likely. The evidence from Italy and other countries with high initial hospital admissions would also seem to back this up with disproportionately high death rates in medical staff. Thus, from a mechanistic standpoint, surgical masks actually do provide protection from bioaerosols to both the wearer and the surrounding people. Even if medical grade surgical masks capable of filtering bioaerosols are in short supply, other forms of masking that can filter large droplets should still be considered. In addition, masking may also reduce the chance of direct inoculation of virus into the wearer's mouth and nose through inadvertent touching of the wearer's face by a contaminated hand.",

The outbreak has been relatively well controlled in areas where universal masking is practiced, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the former, the effective reproductive number (i.e., the number of secondary cases per infectious case) has been kept to below 1.0 thus far [6] . Notwithstanding potential confounders, the circumstantial evidence does beg serious consideration to implement the practice globally. It is postulated that a plummet in the number of cases of H1N1 seasonal flu in Hong Kong might also have been partly due to universal masking [1] . The benefit of relieving the health care burden when it is most stretched, and saving resources for COVID patients cannot be understated.",
