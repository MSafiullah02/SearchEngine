Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital technologies, were some of the key factors in China's efforts to combat this virus. Being inviable and non-measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and curative measures. Infodemic, as it is termed by WHO, is a key word, where different stakeholder's participation, along with stricter regulation, is required to reduce the impact of fake news in this information age and social media. Although different countries will need different approaches, focusing on its humanitarian nature and addressing infodemic issues are the two critical factors for future global mitigation efforts.",

The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province.

SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.",

Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.",

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative.

On the 18th of February, a unique approach of using a QR code was adopted in Wuhan and then spread to other parts of Hubei province using mobility and safety of the person (in terms of effect of Corona virus). This QR code was used for public transport, entering public areas. Using big data in mobile phones, three color coding were used ( Figure 3 ): green (safe), yellow (need to be cautious), and red (cannot enter). Printed QR codes were used for the people who did not have mobile phones (like elderly people or children). On 19 th of February, the \"no one will be spared\" policy was ended. 20th February: A newlywed young doctor passed away, which also created negative sentiment in social media.

To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China's mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court's directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \"Rumors exposed website\" created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28] .",

It also emphasized social science research in the outbreak response, where the WHO will establish a team that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences. As per [30] , governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have a spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact [30] .",

Of course, there are geo-political, economic and social consequences, which also need to be looked at. However, humanitarian issues need to prevail over other priorities. The second point is that Coronavirus is a non-measurable disaster, unlike other invisible disasters like radioactive emission. Therefore, having correct and timely information is crucial for stopping its spread, as well as in the curative prevention of this disease. These two factors, along with good governance and citizen participation, will hold the key to success in combatting Coronavirus in future.",
