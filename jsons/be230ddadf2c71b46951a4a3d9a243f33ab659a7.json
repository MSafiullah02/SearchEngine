Critical in the pathogenesis of MAP infection is the invasion and survival into macrophages, immune cells with ability to carry on phagocytosis of microbes. In a search for effective therapeutics, our objective was to determine whether human cathelicidin LL-37, a small peptide secreted by leuckocytes and epithelial cells, enhances the macrophage ability to clear MAP infection. In murine (J774A.1) macrophages, MAP was quickly internalized, as determined by confocal microscopy using green fluorescence protein expressing MAPs. Macrophages infected with MAP had increased transcriptional gene expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-1\u03b2 cytokines and the leukocyte chemoattractant IL-8. Pretreatment of macrophages with synthetic LL-37 reduced MAP load and diminished the transcriptional expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 whereas increased IL-8. Synthetic LL-37 also reduced the gene expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, key for mycobacterial invasion into macrophages. We concluded that cathelicidin LL-37 enhances MAP clearance into macrophages and suppressed production of tissue-damaging inflammatory cytokines. This cathelicidin peptide could represent a foundational molecule to develop therapeutics for controlling MAP infection.",

In cattle, MAP causes chronic enteritis, clinically characterized by diarrhea, weight loss, and progressive emaciation that leads to reduced production and premature culling or death (Mortier et al. 2015) . Transmission of MAP is generally initiated with the oral ingestion of MAP bacilli excreted in feces or milk (Derakhshani et al. 2016; Corbett et al. 2018 ). This infection with MAP often occurs during the first months of life and elicits a slowly progressive inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract, not clinically apparent for months or years. Moreover, only a minority of cattle (10-15%) exposed to MAP eventually develop clinical disease (Mortier et al. 2015) .",

Macrophages are primary target cells for MAP persistance and replication (Koets et al. 2015) , but they may elicit bactericidal effects in controlling the bacterium. In this host-pathogen interaction, mycobacteria interact with several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages, including TLR-2 and TLR-4 (Quesniaux et al. 2004 ). Signaling of MAP through TLR-2 suppress antimicrobial responses and antigen presentation in macrophages (Weiss et al. 2008) .

            "text": "Murine models have been key to study MAP pathogenesis. Whereas mice are not natural host of MAP and some mice strains (e.g., C3H) are resistant to MAP infection (Chiodini and Buergelt 1993; Tanaka et al. 1994) , experimental challenge with MAP via intraperitoneal (Huntley et al. 2005; Shin et al. 2006) , endovenous (Rosseels et al. 2006) , and oral (Cooney et al. 2014 ) routes reproduced histological and immunological features similar to those observed in ruminants (Hines et al. 2007 ). Moreover, murine macrophages (including phagocytic J774.A1 cells) have been used to decipher host mycobacteria interactions and intracellular growth characteristics of MAP (Kuehnel et al. 2001; Hostetter et al. 2003; Sonawane et al. 2011; Santos et al. 2014) . In search for therapeutics that can \"instruct\" macrophages to control MAP, cathelicidins, small cationic peptides produced by neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses, are of interest (Zanetti 2005; Holani et al. 2018) . Cathelicidins are present in many mammalian species, with several cathelicidins reported in cattle . Humans and mice are unique species to study these peptides, as there is only one type of cathelicidins in humans (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide CAP-18 or leucineleucine with 37 amino acids residue (LL-37)) and in mice (cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP)) (Zanetti 2005). LL-37 is a unique target molecule drug model for mycobacteria related diseases, as it has antimicrobial activity against M. smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis (H37Rv), in both human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophages (Sonawane et al. 2011) . However, the role of cathelicidins in MAP, as antimicrobial or immunomodulator, is largely unknown. Thus, we aimed to characterize the fate of MAP in macrophages treated with synthetic LL-37, as a cathelicidin model, to assess its therapeutic potential in controlling MAP infection.",

GFP MAPs were selectively cultured adding kanamycin (100 \u03bcg/mL). Both MAP K10 GFP (Parker and Bermudez 1997) and MAP A1 157 GFP were comparatively evaluated through macrophage invasion to confirm the MAP virulence after transformation.

Synthetic LL-37 at a dose of 10 \u03bcM did not kill MAP whereas high dosage of cathelicidin (50 \u03bcM) revealed some bactericidal effect on MAP (\u2248 50%) (Fig. 3b) . Same cathelicidin doses (10 and 50 \u03bcM) killed (> 90%) E. coli, a known cathelicidin susceptible bacteria (data not shown). The doses used of synthetic LL-37 (up to 50 \u03bcM) did not cause macrophage cell damage or death as determined by the microscopical observation of healthy macrophages (Suppl Fig. 2a b\"') and a insignificant LDH release compared to control (Suppl Fig. 2c ) after infection with MAP (A1 157, MOIs 1 and 5) for up to 24 h. These studies confirmed cathelicidin reduces the MAP load in macrophages, albeit without killing the host cell or directly killing the bacterium. Macrophages were counterstained with phalloidin, which binds actin cytoskeleton (red) and DAPI as a nucleus maker (blue). Representative images for 3 independent experiments.

Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm LL-37 modulated early synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages challenged by MAP Macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli secrete a signature array of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, which increase vascular permeability and recruit inflammatory cells to the site of infection (Janeway and Medzhitov 2002; Boucher et al. 2018) . MAP infection induces in vitro strong production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in human (THP-1) macrophages (Wang et al. 2014) . We showed that whereas MAP induced transcriptional mRNA synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 in murine macrophages (peak with MOI 5; 3 h) (p < 0.05, Fig. 4a, b) , pretreatment with synthetic LL-37 reduced TNF-\u03b1 synthesis in response to live MAP (MOI 5; 3 and 24 h) (p < 0.05, Fig. 4a, b) . Moreover, concentrations of secreted TNF-\u03b1 were lower in macrophages exposed to MAP and pretreated with LL-37 (385 and 957 pg/mL at 3 and 24 h, respectively) than in challenged macrophages without cathelicidins (464 and 1193 pg/mL; Fig. 4c, d) .",

Thus, we determined whether exogenous cathelicidins modulated neutrophil factor IL-8 synthesis in macrophages as a defensive mechanism. MAP induced a delayed IL-8 transcriptional gene response (MOI 5; 24 h); this was further increased by pretreatment with synthetic LL-37 (MOI 5, mostly at 24 h) as compared to untreated MAP-infected macrophages (p < 0.05, Fig. 4e, f) . LL-37 induced slight decrease in IL-8 transcriptional gene in macrophages challenged with low MAP doses (MOI 1) (p > 0.05; Fig. 4e, f) .

Cellular responses induced by IFN-\u03b3 (e.g., autophagy, lysosomal degradation) are indispensable for resistance to intracelullar pathogens, including MAP (Burger et al. 2018 ). In the present study, pretreatment with LL-37 in MAPinfected macrophages reduced IFN-\u03b3 transcriptional gene expression to baseline levels (MOI 1; 3 h; p < 0.05, Fig. 5a ).

            "text": "Effects of cathelicidin controlling mycobacterial infections in macrophages have been reported. Endogenous overexpression of murine cathelicidin and synthetic human LL-37 (and derived LLKKK-18) increased intracellular killing of M. smegmatis, M. bovis, and M. tuberculosis in murine macrophages (Sonawane et al. 2011 ). However, the antibacterial effect of LL-37 on MAP described here is novel. We found synthetic LL-37 at doses (up to 10 \u03bcM) below half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) (Sonawane et al. 2011) reduced MAP burden in macrophaghes as detected by MAP specific qPCR counting and internalized MAP by confocal microscopy. Moreover, we demonstrated that this cathelicidin dose (up to 10 \u03bcM) has no relevant direct anti-mycobacterial effects on MAP. This finding suggests an immunomodulatory role of exogenous LL-37 increasing the antibacterial defenses in macrophages. Such immunomodulatory effects of low doses of LL-37 have been reported. For instance, low LL-37 dosage (< 1 \u03bcM) inhibited TNF-\u03b1 release from LPS-induced macrophages (Mookherjee et al. 2006 ). Noteworthy, the tested LL-37 concentrations were physiologic, similar to those found in mucosal surfaces in humans (0.5-4 \u03bcM) (Schaller-Bals et al. 2002) , suggesting this function of cathelicidins modulating macrophage behavior may occur in natural conditions. Higher doses of LL-37 (> 5, up to 20 \u03bcM) have been found also detrimental for mycobacteria (Sonawane et al. 2011) , and we showed LL-37 at 50 \u03bcM directly killed some MAP. However, such high doses of cathelicidin with direct killing effect may concur with cytotoxic side outcomes. Thus, the role of cathelicidin stimulating macrophage functions rather than bactericidal effects is of special interest in developing new anti-infectious therapeutics. Regarding naturally occurring host defense peptides, transcriptional gene levels of cathelicidins and related host defense \u03b2-defensin in macrophages did not change during the first 24 h after MAP infection. In contrast, other mycobacteria, M. smegmatis and M. bovis (BCG), upregulated endogenous synthesis of cathelicidins in murine macrophages as early as 1 to 3 h, followed by a rapid decrease after 24 h (Sonawane et al. 2011) . MAP may require longer exposure to induce endogenous cathelicidin-coding gene expression in macrophages or MAP has pathogenic mechanisms to prevent effective innate immune responses.",

In the present study, exogenous LL-37 downregulated the early gene expression of TLR-2 in murine macrophages with no detectable changes in total TLR-2 protein. Reduced TLR-2 availability in macrophages exposed to exogenous cathelicidins may be responsible for impaired engulfment of MAP and thus indirectly reduce immune inflammatory responses, although the surface protein variations may not be noticed by western blotting. Mycobacterial cell wall lipoproteins such as mannosylated lipoarabinomannan may be TLR-2 agonists (Gomes et al. 2008 ) and initiate signaling though the MAPK-p38 pathway (Arsenault et al. 2014) . In fact, a specific lipopeptide (19 kDa) isolated from M. tuberculosis stimulated TLR-2 in macrophages and up-regulated expression of vitamin D receptor, leading to cathelicidin synthesis and killing of intracellular mycobacteria (Liu et al. 2006 ). Furthermore, TLR-2 signaling promoted endogenous cathelicidin gene expression in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to M. avium (Santos et al. 2014 ) and in human macrophages (THP-1) challenged by M. tuberculosis (Yang et al. 2009 ). Equally important for MAP signaling, TLR-4 has been implicated in pro-inflammatory cytokine production during MAP infection in human and murine macrophages (Ferwerda et al. 2007 ) and antigen-presenting cells (Lee et al. 2014 ). However, our study did not find TLR-4 gene expression modification by synthetic cathelicidins. Dysregulated expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 (i.e., polymorphisms or mutations) made cattle more susceptible to Johne's disease (Mucha et al. 2009 ). Thus, the proposed role of synthetic LL-37 modulating certain TLRs in macrophages during MAP infection (e.g., TLR-2) may have therapeutic potential in genetically vulnerable cattle.",

Exaggerated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 contributes to inflammatory damage during MAP infection, including granuloma formation in the ileum (portal of entry for mycobacteria) and in wasting disease (Adams and Czuprynski 1994) . Moreover, anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapeutics for treating related chronic diseases (Crohn's disease) are associated with lesser mucosal inflammation and granuloma formation (Berns and Hommes 2016) . In the present study, we found cathelicidin significatively reduce TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and slightly secreted protein levels. Differences in cytokine kinetic between gene transcription and protein synthesis are indicative that longer exposure with cathelicidins (or higher doses) may be needed to suppress the protein synthesis. This cathelicidin-driven anti-TNF-\u03b1 effect may have clinically relevant anti-inflammatory activity in Johne's disease, reducing tissue damage induced by MAPactivated macrophages. Another key pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, was also disminished by exogenous cathelicidin in macrophages infected with MAP. There was synergy between IFN-\u03b3 and TLR-2 ligands to upregulate cathelicidin expression in human monocytes and macrophages (Rode et al. 2017) . Consequently, suppression of IFN-\u03b3 and TLR-2 gene expression by exogenous LL-37 could prevent endogenous cathelicidin production. In addition, reduced TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages treated with LL-37 may further contribute to reduced synthesis of endogenous cathelicidin, as TNF-\u03b1 knockdown mice infected with M. avium had reduced cathelicidin expression (Santos et al. 2014 ).",

In the absence of effective anti-MAP therapeutics and limited success of vaccine development , this study yielded new knowledge regarding pathogenesis of MAP infection and potential antibacterial and anti-inflammatory roles of synthetic cathelicidins. Administration of exogenous cathelicidins when endogenous production is not sufficient or impaired, due to a pathogen-evasion mechanism, may promote defensive mechanisms on macrophages against mycobacteria. The therapeutic use of cathelicidins to prevent diseases, such as Johne's disease, still remains unknown. Whereas our study in a murine macrophage line indicates cathelicidin may prevent MAP infection, protective effects of cathelicidins need to be confirmed in the natural host (e.g., bovine macrophages).",
