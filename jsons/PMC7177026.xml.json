For example, recent findings show \u00adrelationships between periodontal inflammatory conditions and diabetes, myocardial \u00adinfarction, coronary artery disease, stroke, preeclampsia and rheumatoid arthritis. This suggests that improved oral health may well have the potential to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases as well as their complications. If chronic disease incidence is reduced it may be possible to avoid medical care costs related to treating them. It would be important to know more about the extent to which improved oral health could reduce health care costs and improve lives.",

In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (Medicare Part D). By 2009 Medicare provided $56.6 billion in benefit payments for outpatient prescription drugs and Medicaid paid 15.7 billion for outpatient prescription drugs (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2010). Beneficiaries provided billions more in the form of monthly Part D premiums. The expense of the Medicare prescription drug program and the controversy surrounding its enactment may well have eroded public support for increased Medicare coverage. So while there has been no shortage of effort paid to improving Medicare, the one common theme in all of the recent initiatives is that dental care has been conspicuously omitted. As a result, 43 million Medicare recipients in 2009 (US Census Bureau 2011) continue to have no dental insurance coverage through Medicare.4\n",

In Medicaid, both the State and the Federal government provide funds to cover healthcare services to eligible patients. The bulk of the money comes from the Federal government. Because the Medicaid dollars are limited and coverage for systemic diseases has precedence, Medicaid coverage of dental care has been spotty. Even where it has been provided, payments to dental providers have been so low as to make it difficult or impossible for Medicaid beneficiaries to obtain adequate dental care (Broadwater 2009). The 2008 recession increased the number of Medicaid eligible individuals nationwide. Further, the federal budget deficits of the past few years have reduced the federal contribution to state Medicaid programs. The combination of increases in the number of beneficiaries and diminished revenues has caused a number of states to eliminate or curtail Medicaid dental coverage (eHow 2011; Mullins et al. 2004). The result, 49 million Medicaid beneficiaries in the US (US Census Bureau 2011) in 2009 either had no dental insurance coverage or inadequate coverage.",

In 2009 there were approximately 202 million people enrolled in health insurance plans (US Census Bureau 2011).

Effectively, many (if not most) people who have dental insurance find it coverage to be quite restrictive.

Mealey and Rose note that there is strong evidence that \u201cdiabetes is a risk factor for gingivitis and periodontitis and that the level of glycemic control appears to be an important \u00addeterminant in this relationship\u201d (Mealey and Rose 2008). Moreover, diabetics have a six times greater risk for worsening of glycemic control over time compared to those without periodontitis and, periodontitis is associated with an increased risk for diabetic complications. For example, in one study more than 80% of diabetics with periodontitis experienced one or more major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events compared to 21% of the diabetic subjects without periodontitis (Thorstensson et al. 1996). Also, a longitudinal study of 600 type 2 diabetics found that the death rate from ischemic heart disease was 2.3 times higher in subjects with severe periodontitis and the death rate from diabetic nephropathy was 8.5 times higher (Saremi et al. 2005). Clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment of periodontal disease improved glycemic control in diabetics (Miller et al. 1992). Moreover, investigations have found an association between periodontal disease and the development of glucose intolerance in non-diabetics (Saito et al. 2004). While it is difficult to establish causality and it is possible that other factors influence periodontal disease and medical complications, these studies suggest that treatment of periodontitis substantially improves health and greatly reduces medical complications related to diabetes.",

A study by Slade and colleagues found both a relationship between periodontitis and elevated serum C- reactive protein levels (systemic marker of inflammation and documented risk factor for cardiovascular disease) as well as a relationship among body mass index, periodontitis and CRP concentrations (Slade et al. 2003). Hung and colleagues evaluated the association between baseline number of teeth and incident tooth loss and peripheral arterial disease. They determined that incident tooth loss was significantly associated with PAD, particularly among men with periodontal disease potentially implying an oral infection-inflammation pathway (Hund et al. 2003). The same group of researchers used the population enrolled in the Health Professionals\u2019 Follow-Up Study (41,000 men free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes at baseline) to assess the relationship between tooth loss and periodontal disease and ischemic stroke. Controlling for a wide range of factors including smoking, obesity, and dietary factors, the researchers found a \u201cmodest\u201d Association between baseline periodontal disease history and ischemic stroke (Joshipura et al. 2003). As early as 1993 DeStefano and colleagues found that among 9760 subjects, those with periodontitis had a 25% increased risk of coronary heart disease relative to those without. The association was particularly high among young men. The authors questioned whether the association was causal or not, suggesting that it might be a more general indicator of personal hygiene and possibly health care practices (DeStefano et al. 1993). In 2000 Wu and colleagues used data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study to examine the association between periodontal disease and \u00adcerebrovascular accidents. The study found that periodontitis was a significant risk factor for total CVA, in particular, for non-hemorrhagic stroke (Wu et al. 2000).",

They found that periodontitis was more prevalent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in the control group and that patients who were seropositive for rheumatoid factor were more likely to have moderate to severe periodontitis than patients who were RF negative and also that patients who were positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were more likely to have moderate to severe periodontitis (Redman et al. 2010). Paju and Scannapeico investigated the association among oral biofilms, periodontitis and pulmonary infections. They noted that periodontitis seems to influence the incidence of pulmonary infections, particularly nosocomial pneumonia in high-risk subjects and that improved oral hygiene has been shown to reduce the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia.

A recent report by the UnitedHealth Group Center for Health Reform & Modernization provides a dire estimation \u2013 that more than 50% of adult Americans could have diabetes (15%) or prediabetes (37%) by 2020 at a cost of $3.35 trillion over the decade. This compares with current estimates of 12% of the population with diabetes and 28% with prediabetes, or 40%. These estimates conclude that diabetes and prediabetes will account for 10% of total healthcare spending in 2020 at an annual cost of $500 billion, up from an estimated $194 billion in 2010 (UnitedHealth Center for Health Reform and Modernization 2010). Average annual spending over the next decade by payer type is $103 billion for private health insurance, $204 billion for Medicare, $11 billion for Medicaid and $16.6 billion for the uninsured.",

The American Heart Association estimates the 2010 cost of cardiovascular disease and stroke to be $324 billion in direct expenditures and $41.7 billion for productivity losses due to morbidity and $137.4 billion in lost productivity due to mortality (present value of lost wages at 3%) (Lloyd-Jones et al. 2010). The Centers for Disease Control estimates that during 2007\u20132009 50 million Americans had self-reported doctor diagnosed arthritis, 21 million of them with activity limitations (Cheng et al. 2010). Cisternas and colleagues estimated that total expenditures by US adults with arthritis increased from $252 billion in 1997 to $353 billion in 2005. Most of the increase was attributable to people who had co-occurring chronic conditions (Cisternas et al. 2009). The Cisternas study appears to aggregate all medical care expenditures by people with arthritis (which would include expenditures to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease). An earlier CDC study focused on the direct and indirect costs in 2003 attributable to arthritis that estimated $80.8 billion in direct costs (medical expenditures) and $47 billion in indirect costs (lost earnings) (Yelin et al. 2007).",

As a result, it is incumbent on policymakers, medical and dental research scientists and health economists to investigate and confirm the potential savings that expansion of dental insurance coverage has the potential to produce and to develop hard evidence regarding potential costs of the expansion prior to, not as a part of, political efforts aimed at dental coverage expansion. A responsible, well informed effort to expand dental coverage may well go far to restore public confidence in the health policy process.",

In this instance, we use it literally. In 2008 health care costs in US were $2.2 Trillion. There have been numerous reports on health disparities, the burden of chronic diseases, increasing healthcare costs and the need for change. Long-term economic benefits associated with the cost of care are dependent upon integrating oral health with medicine. This is particularly true as it relates to the management of those conditions which impact the economics of healthcare the most. As examples, 96% of Medicare costs and 83% of Medicaid costs are in managing chronic health conditions (Partnership for Solutions National Program Office 2004). More than 40% of the U.S. population has one or more chronic condition (Cartwright-Smith 2011) and in 2006, 76% of Medicare spending was on patients with five or more chronic diseases (Swartz 2011). Effective management of health care resources and information are critical to the economic well-being of our healthcare system. We can no longer afford to manage care in isolation. Integration of care between medicine and dentistry holds much promise in terms of reducing the cost of care and an integrated Medical-Dental Electronic Healthcare Record (iEHR) is the vehicle that will lead to downstream cost savings.",

Section 121 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 mandated CMS to conduct a disease management demonstration project. April 1, 2005, as an effort to reduce the cost of care and improve quality associated with chronic diseases, CMS partnered with ten premier health systems to effectively manage chronic diseases in a Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration (PGP). It was the first pay-for-performance initiative for physicians under the Medicare program (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2010). It involved giving additional payments to providers based on practice efficiency and improved management of chronically ill patients. Participants included ten multispecialty group practices nationwide, with a total of more than 5,000 physicians, who care for more than 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries (Frieden 2006). The chronic diseases that were targeted were based on occurrence in the population and included diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and hypertension (Frieden 2006). The partners CMS selected were; Billings Clinic, Billings, Montana Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic, Bedford, New Hampshire; The Everett Clinic, Everett, Washington; Forsyth Medical Group, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania; Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wisconsin; Middlesex Health System, Middletown, Connecticut; Park Nicollet Health Services, St. Louis Park, Minnesota; St. John\u2019s Health System, Springfield, Missouri; University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Under the PGP, physician groups continued to be paid under regular Medicare fee schedules and had the opportunity to share in savings from enhancements in patient care management. Physician groups could earn performance payments which were divided between cost efficiency for generating savings and performance on 32 quality measures phased in during the demonstration as follows: year 1, 10 measures, year 2, 27 measures and years 3 and 4 having 32 quality measures. For each of the 4 years only the University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice and Marshfield Clinic, earned performance payments for improving the quality and cost efficiency of care. A large part of the success of this project was attributed to being able to extract, evaluate, and monitor key clinical data associated with the specific disease and to manage that data through an electronic health record (Table 4.4).\n",

The case for medical and dental professionals\u2019 co-managing patients has been suggested for almost the past century, in 1926 William Gies reported that \u201cThe frequency of periodic examination gives dentists exceptional opportunity to note early signs of many types of illnesses outside the domain of dentistry\u201d (Gies 1926). As described by Dr. Richard Nagelberg, DDS \u201cThe convergence of dental and medical care is underway. Our patients will be the beneficiaries of this trend. For too long, we have provided dental care in a bubble, practicing \u2013 to a large degree \u2013 apart from other health-care providers. Even when we consulted with our medical colleagues, it was to find out if premedication was necessary, get clearance for treatment of a medically compromised patient, or find out the HbA1c level of a diabetic individual, rather than providing true patient co-management. We have made diagnoses and provided treatments without the benefit of tests, reports, metrics, and other information that predict the likelihood of disease development and progression, as well as favorable treatment outcomes. We have practiced in this manner not due to negligence, but because of the limitations of tools that were available to us\u201d (Nagelberg 2011). Integrated medical/dental records need to be a tool in a providers\u2019 toolbox. In the case of Marshfield Clinic, dental was not included in their past CMS demonstration project as dental is not a CMS covered benefit, and thus not part of the demonstration. However, as a leader in healthcare, the Marshfield Clinic recognizes the importance of data integration for both increased quality and cost savings. \u201cMarshfield Clinic believes the best health care comes from an integrated dental/medical approach,\u201d said Michael Murphy, director, Business Development for Cattails Software. Integration enhances communication between providers and can ultimately lead to better management of complex diseases with oral-systemic connection, avoidance of medical errors, and improved public health.",

CIGNA also cited the correlation between periodontal disease and low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes as additional rationale to support extended dental benefits to expecting mothers. Six months later CIGNA initiated Well Aware for Better Health, an extended benefits free of charge program for diabetic and cardiovascular disease patients aimed at \u201cturning evidence into action by enhancing dental benefits for participants in disease management\u201d programs.

The VA is one of the few institutions that have implemented the shared electronic medical\u2013dental record successfully. The VA has the ability to be the \u201cone stop shop\u201d for their patients. An April 2010 press release published on the Department of Veterans Affairs website highlighted the success of VA\u2019s health information technology in terms of cost reductions and \u201cimprovements in quality, safety, and patient satisfaction\u201d (Department of Veterans Affairs 2010). The press release spotlighted a recent study conducted by the public health journal, Health Affairs, which focused on VA\u2019s health IT investment from 1997 to 2007. The study confirmed that while VA has spent $4 billion on their technology initiative, a conservative estimate of cost savings was more than $7 billion. After subtracting the expense of the IT investment, there was a net savings of $3 billion for the VA during the 10 years covered by the study (McBride 2011). Furthermore, the study estimated that \u201cmore than 86 percent of the savings were due to eliminating duplicated tests and reducing medical errors. The rest of the savings came from lower operating expenses and reduced workload.\u201d Independent studies show that the VA system does better on many measures, especially preventive services and chronic care, than the private sector and Medicare. VA officials say \u201cits [integrated] technology has helped cut down hospitalizations and helped patients live longer\u201d (Zhang 2009).",

            "text": "Several other areas of economic impact will be seen as iEHR\u2019s become broadly deployed. Some of these are listed as follows:\nMedication management. A great deal of provider and allied support time is spent obtaining medication information between dentistry and medicine [and vice versa] including current medications, contraindications, tolerances, etc. Marshfield Clinic Cattails software has created a dashboard that readily identifies this for both the medical and dental providers. Not is time saved but chances for complications or escalation of conditions is reduced [both of which impact cost]. For example an integrated record allows medical providers treating respiratory infections to include or exclude oral flora as the possible source of the infection which would lead to more knowledgeable prescribing decision on the antibiotic used.Coordination of care has a direct impact on cost for the system and the patient. For example, in 2008 55.6% of the US population aged 2 years and older that was diagnosed diabetes had been to the dentist in the past year (Healthy People 2020 (2010)). The US government\u2019s program Healthy People 2020 includes an initiative to increase the proportion of people with diagnosed diabetes who have at least an annual dental examination. The American Diabetes Association recommends that diabetic patients be seen semi-annually and more if bleeding gums or other oral issues are present. The American Diabetes Association also recommends the consultation between the dentist and doctor to decide about possible adjustments to diabetes medicines, or to decide if an antibiotic is needed before surgery to prevent infection. The target from the Healthy People 2020 is a 10% improvement at 61.2%. Integrated medical/dental records could allow for the coordination of efforts between providers to include communication of treatment plan and services leading to quicker resolution, increased patient compliance, and less patient time away from work or home and potentially less travel.Similarly, integrated records also create a platform to integrate clinical \u00adappointing between medicine and dentistry. As such, combative patients or severely disabled patients needing anesthesia in order for care to be delivered can be treated with one hospital sedation vs. multiple sedations. Family Health Center of Marshfield, Inc. (FHC) Dental Clinics shares an iEHR with Marshfield Clinic and uses it integrated scheduling feature to complete dental care, lab work, ENT care, woman\u2019s health, preventive studies, all in one visit.Follow up care management can be more focused and coordinated. For example, without the knowledge or dental conditions, medical providers could spend months attempting to control diabetes with periodontal disease. However, with access to an iEHR, the practitioner or allied care manager can determine patient\u2019s oral health status immediately to determine possible influence of periodontal disease.Similarly an iEHR with a shared patient data dashboard brings to light history and physical examination data without having to have patients be the historian to their physician on their last dental visit or for the dentist to have to rely on the patient\u2019s recall of medications or medical diagnosis. For example, if an integrated record saved providers 5 min per hour of patient care, that would be 40 min per day. Imagine giving a physician or dentist 40 min more a day. In a capitated system, this allows for more patients to be seen in a day for roughly the same amount of expenditure. In a production based clinic this allows more patients to be seen and more charges per day. In either case, the investment into informatics is covered. In an underserved area, more patients get care quicker, which creates the opportunity for quicker resolution, which can lead to a healthier society, which in turn may lead them back to a productive livelihood sooner.An iEHR results in one system for acquisition, orientation, training and support. PC based owners who also own a Mac and Mac owners who also have to operate a PC can relate. Need we say more? Imagine if your PC function just like a Mac [or your Mac function just a PC]. No cross learning of software quirks. Not having to purchase two separate units to begin with. Reduced costs, increased space. Not having to jump from one computer to the other computer to get data from one data from another to create a report. Not having to call two separate computer companies for service or updates.Third Party Coordination. Having an iEHR creates a platform for interfacing with third party payers. A common system and language for timely reimbursement. In part, the result of an iEHR is driving the diagnostic coding for dentistry. Such an integrated interface provides a tool to bridge with healthcare payors that historically kept payment as segregated as the oral and medical health professions. The iEHR overcomes that limitation. Timely payment, consolidation of payment, expansion of covered patient and provider benefits based on clinical integration, and a viable system for interfacing are all potential economic benefits of iEHR clinical data.The iEHR creates new horizons for research that will lead to cost saving discoveries. As example, knowing the benefits of research, Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation (MCRF) has created an Oral and Systemic Health Research Project (OSHRP). The creation of OSHRP, led by Dr. Murray Brilliant, will allow MCRF to capitalize on its existing and growing strengths in the areas of complex disease interactions and Personalized Health Care (PHC) to advance oral health and the health of the rest of the body. The OSHRP has three specific goals:\nUnderstand the connections between oral and systemic health (diabetes, heart disease, pre-term births)Understand the causes of oral diseases and determine the effect of genetics, diet, water source (well/city  +  fluoridation) and microbiome.Understand how improving oral health aids systemic health (comparative effectiveness) and bring Personalized Health Care (PHC) to the dental arena.\nThe OSHRP research resource will be unique in the nation. As MCRF has done with other projects, it will share this resource with qualified investigators at other academic institutions both within and outside of Wisconsin. OSHRP will advance scientific knowledge, improve healthcare and prevention, reduce the cost of oral healthcare, and create new economic opportunities. Such knowledge will have a direct economic impact on the cost of care and care management.The iEHR creates an ability to have an integrated patient portal to comprehensively maintain their health. Portals are becoming more and more popular in the healthcare industry as a means to helping maintain compliance with care management recommendations and preventative procedures. Portals provide patents a tool to stay up to date on their care and recommendations. Portals can take iEHR clinical data, adapt it through programming, and provide creative visual reinforcement for patients as they monitor their health status. The more patients engage in owning their health status, the more preventative services are followed through with. The more medicine and dentistry can leverage the prevention potential [which insurance companies have come to realize] the more likely costly conditions can be avoided.\n",

            "text": "Although many factors can influence children\u2019s oral health outcomes, caries is largely a preventable disease. Despite this, national trends and other data on children\u2019s oral health attest to this persistent national problem (Mouradian et al. 2009). Some important facts include the following\u2026.\nCaries is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood,Caries is a preventable disease unlike many chronic diseases of childhood,Yet according to (NICDR 2011) 42% of children 2\u201311 have had dental caries in their primary teeth; 23% of children 2\u201311 have untreated dental caries. Further, \u201c21% of children 6\u201311 have had dental caries in their permanent teeth; 8% of children 6\u201311 have untreated decay.\u201d Overall \u201c[c]hildren 2\u201311 have an average of 1.6 decayed primary teeth and 3.6 decayed primary surfaces,\u201dThe latest epidemiologic evidence shows increasing rates of caries for youngest children, reverse from the Healthy People 2010 goal of decreasing caries. According to (NICDR 2011), overall \u201cdental caries in the baby teeth of children 2\u201311 declined from the early 1970s until the mid 1990s. From the mid 1990s until the most recent (1999\u20132004) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, this trend has reversed: a small but significant increase in primary decay was found. This trend reversal was more severe in younger children.\u201dDisparities in children\u2019s oral health and access to care persist by age, income level, race and ethnicity, and parental education level (Edelstein and Chinn 2009). Of concern, the latest increase was actually in a traditionally low-risk group of young children (Dye and Thornton-Evans 2010).The human and economic costs of early childhood caries are substantial (Casamassimo et al. 2009). According to Catalanotto (2010), health consequences include\u2026\nextreme pain,spread of infection/facial cellulitis, even death (Otto 2007)difficulty chewing, poor weight gainfalling off the growth curve (Acs et al. 1999)risk of dental decay in adult teeth (Broadbent et al. 2005; Li and Wang 2002)crooked bite (malocclusion)\nChildren with special health care needs (CSHCN) may be at higher risk for oral disease and difficulties accessing care. Analyzing data from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, (Lewis 2009) found that \u201cCSHCN are more likely to be insured and to receive preventive dental care at equal or higher rates than children without special health care needs. Nevertheless, CSHCN, particularly lower income and severely affected, are more likely to report unmet dental care need compared with unaffected children.\u201d Children who were both low-income and severely affected had 13.4 times the likelihood of unmet dental care needs,Dental care is the highest unmet health care need of children; 4.6 million children had unmet dental care needs because families could not afford care compared with 2.8 million with unmet medical needs for the same reasons (CDC 2008),According to the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health, children are 2.6 times as likely to lack dental as medical insurance (Lewis et al. 2007),There is evidence that children who get referred to a dentist early may have lower costs of care and disease. Savage et al. (2004) reported that children \u201cwho had their first preventive visit by age 1 were more likely to have subsequent preventive visits but were not more likely to have subsequent restorative or emergency visits\u201d and concluded that preschool \u201cchildren who used early preventive dental care incurred fewer dentally related costs,\u201dRamos-Gomez and Shepherd (1999), in their \u201cCost-effectiveness Model for Prevention of Early Childhood Caries,\u201d conclude that preventive ECC interventions could reduce ECC by 40\u201380% for a particularly vulnerable population of children, and that part of the costs of interventions will be offset by savings in treatment costs.\n",

            "text": "As pediatric clinicians (both medical and dental) work more closely together, they require appropriate EHR systems that integrate a patient\u2019s medical and dental records. Following is a set of local \u201cbest practices\u201d from Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, which may help other children\u2019s hospitals in planning acquisition of an integrated pediatric EHR system. Integrated (medical-dental) EHR technologies are becoming more widely available outside the Federal government sector (see integrated models E1 and E2 in 10.1007/978-1-4471-2185-5_1). Nationwide Children\u2019s \u2018drivers\u2019 for the acquisition process were, in 2011:\n\nMinimize registration and dual databases. Patient registration takes time and requiring both a stand-alone dental and a medical patient registration inhibits cost-effective flow of services. Integration allows for the use of single demographics information for all clinics in the comprehensive care system serving the patient. Clinicians always have an updated health history on patients, if they have been a patient of record. If not, and for a dental clinic that sees walk-ins, a brief \u201ccritical\u201d dental health history can be completed on paper by a parent and scanned into the eMR. In designing an integrated medical-dental record for patients of record, the system can sort essential health history elements into a brief focused dental history without the detail needed by other medical specialty clinics. Kiosk-driven electronic health histories for those children who are new to clinic similar to those used in airline travel could be considered if feasible in busy clinics.\nFor charting, no more key/mouse strokes than with paper. Some commercial dental record products try to accomplish too much. Moving from paper to electronics should be driven in part by efficiencies. The tooth chart, which is an essential part of any dental record, must be such that examination findings can be transferred quickly and accurately to either paper or electronic capture. A helpful exercise is visualization of the functionality of the charting process, including both the different types of entries (caries, existing restorations and pathology) and how these are entered in the paper world.If charting will be able to be used for research the system should be able to translate pictures to numerical values, often a complex programming function. Dental practitioners and faculty may want to use drawings of teeth or graphics of surfaces because that is their current comfort level. A true digital charting is possible with no images of teeth, but some habits are hard to change.\nMaximizing drop downs with drop down building possible. Duplication of paper chart entries using drop downs which can be upgraded as more clinical entities are found is a staple of an EMR. The paper process usually relies on a clinician\u2019s wealth of medical-dental terms since inclusion of every possible, or even the most common findings, is prohibitive on a paper chart. The EMR drop down requires front-end loading of the most common clinical findings with opportunity for free-hand additions. Being able to add terms to any drop down is a needed capability.\nDon\u2019t design a system for uncommon contingencies, but for your bulk of work. A pediatric dental record should be primarily designed around dental caries, with secondary emphases on oral-facial development (orthodontics) and a lesser capability to record traumatic injuries and periodontal findings. These second and third level characteristics can be hot-buttoned and should not drive the design of the basic system which is caries charting for 98% of our patients. Sadly in most dental schools, the chart is slave to every teaching form, few of which ever exit with the DDS into practice! These forms may have little relationship to patient care and only create \u201csignature black holes\u201d that need to be addressed, usually after treatment is completed.\nProgress notes should be designed for the routine entries with free-hand modification possible. Student learners tend to write too much and a carefully crafted progress note format with standard entries in required fields helps patient flow and record completion. In federally funded clinics and residencies, attending reconciliation of student/resident service delivery is a compliance requirement. A well-designed EMR system can \u201cstack\u201d required co-signing tasks on a computer screen, offer standard entries as well as free-hand options, and create a process far faster than paper records for an attending\u2019s validation (same as reconciliation?).\nTie examination results to treatment planning and treatment planning into billing. A good system allows easy transfer of clinical findings needing treatment into some problem \u201cbasket\u201d and ideally in a tabulated format. An alternative is a split screen that allows a clinician to visualize clinical findings, radiographic findings while compiling a treatment plan. Again, in clinical settings where compliance to Medicaid/Medicare regulations is required, the design of the record should give attention to auditing principles and security. A good EMR system allows portals of entry for billing and compliance personnel.\nPlan for users of different skill levels and different periods of exposure. The teaching hospital or dental school environment often involves learners and attendings with varying skill levels and computer experience who may be there for brief periods of time. This reality adds significant security and user-friendliness issues. Some medical record systems are far too complex for short-term or casual users. A well-integrated medical-dental EMR allows navigation of the depths of the medical side should a user want to explore, but should focus on the dental portion. Some suggestions in design:\nInitial opening or logging into the dental portion for dental users, rather than opening into the medical portion,Clearly indicated options for exploration of medical portions,Orientation of major dental component (examination, radiographs, treatment plan) in a logical dental treatment flow to replicate the way dentistry works rather than trying to reshape dentistry\u2019s normal flow to the record,Minimization of seldom-used functions on the main dental screen, such as specialty medical clinics, old laboratory tests and hyperfunctionalities like letter writing,Clear identification of existing non-caries dental portions like orthodontics or trauma, so a novice user need not randomly search to see if a patient has any of these records.\n\n",

No chronic kidney disease was defined as an estimated GFR of 60 ml per min per 1.73 m2. Three percent of the patients had CKD, 22.5% were hypertension and 4.4% had diabetes (2.4% with glycated hemoglobin of 7% or higher). Four models were constructed to examine the potential relationship between periodontal disease and CKD. In model one adults with either \u00adperiodontal disease or edentulous had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.83 (with 95% confidence \u00adintervals of 1.31\u20132.55) of having CKD, independent of the other risk factors for CKD including of age above 60 years, ethnicity, hypertension, smoking status, female gender and C-reactive protein elevation. The fourth model contained 15 potential risk factors including the periodontal disease score and for every 1-unit increase in the score, the risk of having CKD increased by 1% controlling for the other risk factors. The authors hypothesized from their results that the relationship between periodontal disease and CKD was bidirectional in that CKD may increase the risk of periodontal disease which in turn increases the risk of CKD.",

In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, individuals with hypertensive retinopathy signs such as cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages and microaneurysms were two to four times more likely to develop a stroke within 3 years, even when controlling for the effects of blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking and other risk factors (Wong et al. 2001). In a recent study by Werther et al., patients with retinal vein occlusions were found to have a two-fold increased risk of stroke compared to controls (Werther et al. 2011).",

Since the maxillary sinus floor is in close proximity to the maxillary premolars and molars, it is imperative to obtain a dental evaluation in persistent cases of headache. There are a number of causes for headache from the dental and otolaryngology perspective. A mal-aligned denture patient with chronic headache, whom I saw in my practice was shuttled between departments and an array of investigations only to find at the end that an ill-fitting denture caused the intractable headache. In these cases, an integration of findings is extremely important in providing quality treatment to the patient and also saves money and time for the whole health care system.

Otherwise, the condition will consume valuable time of both the patient and the physician concerned.
