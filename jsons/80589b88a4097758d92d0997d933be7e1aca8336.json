Ironically, it is the smallest state in terms of land mass. The state has an area of 356,861 hectares of which 75,755 hectares are wetlands. Metropolitan Lagos, an area covering 37% of the land area of Lagos State, is home to over 85% of the state's population making it densely populated. The United Nations estimates that at its present growth rate, the state of Lagos may, in the near future be one of the top most populous mega-cities in the world joining, Tokyo in Japan and Bombay in India (UN 2016) . Poverty levels in Lagos remain at about 48-50%. While access to health and education is quite high, poverty remains a huge challenge especially with rapid population migration into Lagos from other Nigerian states especially in the North and East.",

For Lagos to be liveable for all its inhabitants, Government authorities, as well as the local population would have to create and maintain an enabling environment that allows Lagosians to meet their maximum human capability. Above all, it would need to establish a health service delivery system that is accessible, qualitative, affordable and diverse. This process can best be fascilitated by using innovative public health approaches and the use of technology. It would also have to revisit its existing public health services and infrastructure to meet the growing health needs of populations in the megacity. The Lagos state government, in collaboration with the federal government is already making major investments in health and it is hoped that these investments, both human and infrastructural would would prepare Lagos state public health authorities to quickly manage a disease outbreak. However, at this stage, the state is directing much of its efforts towards preventive measures, especially after its experience with Ebola in 2014. To achieve these goals, Lagos state has adopted a number of policies aimed at improving overall population health. Current policy direction includes environmental infrastructure such as the much needed drainage and sewage systems. Others are policies on waste management, green areas, the reduction of pollution, slum reclamation, multimodal-transportationl system, Lagos bus rapid transit system, traffic law, Security-trust fund, disaster management, low-cost housing, health care, Safety-infrastructure, public health financing, health promotion and disease prevention.",

This led to a delay in securing adequate health care teams (especially doctors, nurses, public health experts) to effectively respond to the Ebola crisis. There was a lot of panic, fear and anxiety amongst health care workers, political leaders and the population, in general. During contact tracing, some people were difficult, evasive and downright hostile. They hid information and others preferred discrete followup. Stigmatization of both contacts and cases was a serious issue. Rumors, especially through the social media platforms travelled fast. There was community resistance due to ignorance in the spheres of religion and culture. For instance, in terms of religion, there was the tendency for some who suspected that they might have been contracted Ebola to make the churches or mosques the first port of call, while many traditionalists preferred to visit traditional medicine practitioners. Of course there were the rumors that the use of traditional medical potions had been used to treat persons infected with Ebola in certain communities. Undoubtedly, all these were anecdotes with hardly any evidential basis. If anything, they only made it difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the disease.",

Firstly, Nigeria had a first-rate virology laboratory that is affiliated to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. This unit is equipped with the appropriate infrastructure and resources to diagnose a case of Ebola virus disease. Therefore, there was some level of preparedness. Secondly, once it was confirmed that there was a case of Ebola in Nigeria, the government reacted promptly and quickly allocated funds for an emergency response.

As a result of this, the government, quickly asked that designated Ebola treatment and isolation facilities be set up built in Lagos and Port Harcourt, the tow cites that had reported cases of Ebola. More so, the government quickly set up sensitisation campaigns including: house-to-house health education programs, radio programs in English and local dialects.
