In his work Historia Animalium, Aristotle was the first to make many pertinent observations about dolphins, including the fact that they would bear their young alive, suckle them, breathe air, and communicate by underwater sounds. From his descriptions and writings, we know that in the 4th century BC there were dolphins in the Mediterranean and porpoises in the Black Sea. Accurate natural history observation on the biology of marine mammals expanded throughout the time associated to morphologic descriptions in the pre-1900s and followed by description of behavior and distribution during the times of hunting and whaling activities. Studies of life history patterns, habitat use, and behavior in captivity or in nature started only in the second half of the last century, slowly combining aspects of mammalogy, ethology, ecology, conservation, evolutionary biology, and, finally, molecular biology.",

The therapeutic control of a medical condition is generated from the basic concept that genes make proteins that catalyze a biochemical reaction and control the phenotype of the organism.

            "text": "Genomics is an area that concerns the sequencing and analysis of an organism\u2019s genome. The cost of genome sequencing has gone down drastically from the 3 billion dollars used for the first human genome sequencing in the beginning of this century to about 3 thousand dollars in the year 2016 (and probably the half of that by the end of 2017), resulting in the establishment of the size and sequence of the genome of over a thousand species of organisms. Such knowledge of genome sequence has been useful in many ways. For example, we know that the minimum number of genes to sustain life by a bacterium is only 260. It also led to the surprising understanding that humans carry only 20,000 genes, against the previous guess that humans may have up to 100,000 genes. The sequencing of the entire DNA of an organism is called a whole genome sequence (WGS). A WGS project involves the sequencing of DNA, the assembly of that sequence to create a representation of the original chromosome, and the annotation and analysis of that representation, with an emphasis on significance and function. It aims at the collective characterization of coding and noncoding DNA regions, their structure, function, and evolution. It reveals the complete DNA makeup of an organism, enabling the better understanding of the variations both within and between species, allowing an accurate differentiation between organisms. Comparisons of genome sequences from different individuals have led to the establishment of copy number variation with over 10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). SNPs can provide a genetic fingerprint for use in identity testing and are found to be involved in the etiology of many diseases. Several studies have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of WGS, for example, in mutation detection (Lupski et al., 2010, Herdewyn et al., 2012, Bae et al., 2014) or in the identification of clinically relevant variants in \u223c40% of pediatric populations with autism (Weedon et al., 2014) and \u223c60% of those with intellectual disability (Gilissen et al., 2014).\n",

The term can be applied to the total set of transcripts in a given organism, or to the specific subset in a particular tissue.

            "text": "Differently from the genome, the transcriptome can vary with external environmental conditions. Generally transcriptomic studies are referred to expression profiling studies, examining the expression level of mRNAs in a given cell population. Transcriptome analysis allows us to understand the expression of a genome at the transcription level, which provides information on gene structure, regulation of gene expression, gene product functions, and genome dynamics. Understanding the transcriptome is essential for interpreting the functional elements of the genome and revealing the molecular constituents of cells and tissues, and also for understanding development and disease. Transcriptome analysis can be carried out at the resolution of single cells, a powerful strategy to connect gene expression networks, cell lineage, and phenotype of individual cells and to study complex disease such as cancer, as well as other biologic phenomena such as tissue regeneration, embryonic development, and immune response (Liu and Trapnell, 2016, Kanter and Kalisky, 2015). Comparison of transcriptomes allows the analysis of interspecies differences (Shay et al., 2013), the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in distinct cell populations, across tissues and individuals (Mele et al., 2015), in response to an injury (Khan et al., 2017) or to different treatments (Datta et al., 2016). Transcriptome sequencing can evaluate absolute transcript levels of sequenced and unsequenced organisms, detect novel transcripts and isoforms, and reveal sequence variations and splice variants. Affordable and fast, it is the most informative assay to start with, offering an overview of the expressed genes to guide subsequent analyses (carried through proteomics, metabolomics, and other methods).",

Differently from genomics and transcriptomics, propelled by advancement in sequencing technologies, proteomics has been driven by advances in mass spectrometry (MS) and other techniques that allow the analysis of a large number of protein samples at low cost (e.g., 2D gel electrophoresis). Proteomics is the study of how protein quantities, modifications, and structures change during development and in response to internal or external stimuli. The proteome of an organism is much larger and complex than its genome. Contrarily from the genome, the proteome changes constantly: DNA in organisms is essentially constant throughout their lives, while the kinds and amounts of proteins that are synthesized at any instant are subject to much variation. Proteins are continuously made, modified, and eliminated; many genes encode for more than one version of a protein, and a protein can be modified differently in response to cellular stimuli. The field of proteomics investigates which proteins are expressed at what stages in an organism\u2019s life and exactly how and why these proteins are expressed. Protein controls the structure and function of a cell by facilitating all biochemical reactions. Proteomics contributes to improve biomarker translation to modern medicine (Rifai et al., 2006, Veenstra, 2007). Biomarkers are measurable characteristics that reflect physiologic, pharmacologic, or disease processes and can be used to screen an individual for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Proteomic-based approaches for biomarker investigation can be employed in different aspects of medicine, to better understand pathways affected in a disease, to identify individuals at a high risk of developing the disease, and to identify individuals who are most likely to respond to specific treatment (Guest et al., 2013). The application goes beyond medicine: biomarkers may, in fact, be the best approach to identify an early response to contaminants (Broeg et al., 2005) and are very sensitive for identifying an organism\u2019s stress, although it is not always clear the origin of the stress, and there are often multiple stressors present (Smit et al., 2009). Biomarker responses can be measured in organisms collected from or deployed in field sites to integrate the effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors, reducing the need for complex laboratory exposure scenarios.",

The metabolome is the final product of gene transcription, and therefore, changes in the metabolome are amplified relative to changes in the transcriptome and the proteome (Urbanczyk-Wochniak et al., 2003). The metabolome contains the smallest domain (made up of approximately 5000 metabolites vs. 100,000 proteins in the proteome and 20,000 expressed genes in the genome), but it also contains the most diverse biologic molecules, which can make it more physically and chemically complex than the other \u201comes.\u201d",

The epigenome is made up of chemical compounds and proteins that can attach to DNA and can turn genes on or off, controlling the production of proteins in precise cells. These modifications are sometimes passed on from cell to cell as cells divide (mitosis) and can be passed down from one generation to the next (meiosis); hence, they are heritable. The epigenome can also change throughout a person\u2019s lifetime. Adjustments to next-generation sequencing protocols to enrich for the DNA regions carrying modifications (e.g., bisulfite treatment or antibody-based methods) are applied to the study of epigenetic processes. One type of modification is called DNA methylation, where methyl groups attached to the bases of the DNA molecule turn genes on or off.

Epidemiological evidence increasingly suggests that early life exposures to dietary and environmental exposures can have a profound effect on the epigenome, resulting in birth defects and diseases developed later in life (Dolinoy et al., 2007, Jirtle and Skinner, 2007). The normal role in development and differentiation of epigenetic regulation can be misdirected, leading to a number of diseases including cancer (Jones and Baylin, 2007, Robertson, 2005). The epigenetic alterations are more readily reversible than genetic events, offering potential for the development of therapies (Reamon-Buettner and Borlak, 2007).",

This area promises to have a large impact on many other scientific and medical disciplines, as scientists can now generate complete descriptions of how components of biologic systems work together in response to various stresses, drugs, or toxicants (Gomase and Tagore, 2008). Due to the rapid advent in genomics technologies and attention to ecologic risk assessment, the term \u201cecotoxicogenomics\u201d has recently emerged to describe integration of omics technologies (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics) into ecotoxicologic fields. Ecotoxicogenomics is defined as study of an entire set of genes or proteins expression in nontarget organisms that is important in responses to environmental toxicant exposures, offering benefit in ecologic risk assessment (Kim et al., 2015). While the availability of genomic information about nonmodel organisms is expanding, the application of ecotoxicogenomics to a variety of organisms becomes a powerful tool for evaluating the effects of chemicals on the entire ecosystems (Iguchi et al., 2006, Watanabe and Iguchi, 2003).",

            "text": "The pregenomic era was characterized by the Human Genome Project (HGP), an international research effort to determine the sequence of the human genome and to identify the genes that it contains. The first draft was released in 2001 (Lander et al., 2001), and the project was finally completed in 2003, 2.5 years ahead of time, and also significantly under budget, thanks to the advancement in sequencing technology and reduced cost. By the time the HGP began in the late 1990s, the highest estimates put the number of human protein-coding genes at 100,000, and since then the number has continued to shrink. However, at present, the final number of true protein-coding genes in the reference genome lies between 19,000 and 20,000, accounting for 1.5% of the 3 billion base pairs representing the entire genome. Of course, this information led to many unanswered questions that characterize what is presently called \u201cthe postgenomic era.\u201d The focus is on the discovery and explanation of all the functional elements encoded within the genome sequence, and the comparison of related genomes has emerged as a powerful instrument for genome interpretation. In an effort seeking the identification of functional elements that are conserved across mammals, a project funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute, the bottlenose dolphin has been chosen as one of 24 animals whose genome has been sequenced as part of the comparative genomic annotation (Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011). The first marine mammal genome to be sequenced was sequenced at 2\u00d7 coverage, with its first version publicly available in 2010. In a 2\u00d7 coverage, each genomic base is represented in roughly two sequence reads (\u201c2\u00d7\u201d redundancy), leaving many gaps in the final sequence due to statistical fluctuations in read placement, biases in preparative libraries, and difficulties leading to a low-quality assembly. The low coverage has significant effects on the subsequent analyses: the absence of a protein-coding gene, or a disruption of its open reading frame, may represent a deficiency of the assembly or may represent a real evolutionary gene loss. Moreover, low depth can introduce sequence errors that can be propagated, leading to wrong conclusions of a study (Green, 2007). However, a low-redundancy genome, such as the 2\u00d7 dolphin genome sequenced, is useful to obtain biologic information: partial sequences of most genes and other evolutionarily conserved segments average estimates of mutation rates, as well as a comprehensive assessment of interspersed repeat content including the identification of lineage-specific families. A comparison of about 10,000 protein-coding sequences from the bottlenose dolphin genome with nine other amniotes genomes documented rates of synonymous substitution in the dolphin lineage that were significantly lower than other mammals and equivalent to that of humans and elephants. The dolphin lineage exhibited evidence of positive selection of multiple genes associated with the nervous system, metabolic processes, and glycemic regulation, and others possibly linked to cetacean specializations such as deep diving, blubber, and fat storage. In addition, the dolphin lineage showed a significant increase in selection on genes expressed in the mitochondrion in comparison with other mammalian genomes (McGowen et al., 2012). A deeper analysis using 11,838 high-quality orthologous gene alignments selected from the dolphin and four other terrestrial mammalian genomes identified genes that had undergone positive selection that are significantly enriched in the categories of lipid transport and localization, ATPase activity, sense perception of sound, and muscle contraction, all areas that are potentially related to cetacean adaptations (Nery et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2013). The dolphin genome has been used to obtain information on the independent evolution of echolocation in bats and cetaceans (Parker et al., 2013). More information has been obtained, increasing the coverage of the bottlenose dolphin genome; the analysis revealed that parallel substitutions are widespread in marine mammals, but also that while convergent phenotypic evolution can result from convergent molecular evolution, in the evolution process are more often used different molecular pathways to reach the same phenotypic outcome (Foote et al., 2015, Zhou et al., 2015). Among the whales, a comparative genomic analysis identified the expansion in the whale lineage of gene families associated with stress-responsive proteins and anaerobic metabolism, whereas gene families related to body hair and sensory receptors were contracted (Yim et al., 2014). Further insights into the genomic basis of aquatic adaptations in marine mammals that can be linked to their physiology and health may rely on functional or genomic analyses of noncoding regions, which will be soon achieved thanks to the latest release of novel genomes, first among all the bottlenose dolphin genome with 114.5\u00d7 coverage. From the current annotation report, the bottlenose dolphin genome seems to contain about 17,000 protein-coding genes in 2.1 billion base pairs. The current coverage is about 95% versus the 86% of the previously implemented version. The advancement in sequencing technologies, together with the reduced cost, has made possible the sequencing of genomes of several other marine mammals in the last few years. To date, the genomes of several marine mammal species have been annotated and released by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline: five belonging to the order of Cetartiodactyla (Balaenoptera acutorostrata scammoni, minke whale; Lipotes vexillifer, Yangtze River dolphin; Orcinus orca, killer whale; Physeter catodon, sperm whale; Tursiops truncatus, bottlenose dolphin), three belonging to the order of Carnivora (Leptonychotes weddellii, Weddell seal; Ursus maritimus, polar bear; Odobenus rosmarus divergens, Pacific walrus), and one belonging to the order of Sirenia (Trichechus manatus latirostris, Florida manatee).",

            "text": "Transcriptomics in marine mammal science is unquestionably the omics approach more represented in the literature. The reasons are several, the first being the cost of the experimental procedure: it is extremely less expensive to sequence only the small coding fraction of the genome instead of the whole with best coverage and resolution. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis does not necessarily need a reference genome. Therefore, the transcriptomic approach has been in use for many years now, refined by the advancement in sequencing technologies. Transcriptomic analyses aid discovery of novel gene functions and the connection of molecular and physiologic responses to a large scale of stimuli (ecologic, anthropogenic). The principal methods used are the gene expression microarrays and the more recent RNA-seq. With gene expression microarrays, thousands of genes are analyzed simultaneously in any given sample, thus obtaining a lot of information about the physiologic systems and the impact of environmental challenges. In 2007, the first microarray for marine mammal studies was developed. It was a species-specific cDNA microarray containing 1395 unigenes selected from targeted cloning and T and B cells cDNA libraries features (Mancia et al., 2007). The first microarray was useful for stress response and immune function studies in wild dolphins (Mancia et al., 2008, Mancia et al., 2010). The blood transcriptome reveled that (1) the dolphin immune system mechanisms have high similarity to those of humans and other terrestrial mammals; (2) the immune system of the dolphins, resident inhabitants of coastal locations of temperate waters worldwide, reflects the environmental condition in which they live; and (3) the sampling method impact on downstream analysis underlines the need for species-specific baseline data. The same microarray was applied to screen a different tissue in a study focused on the study of the vitamin D3 pathway on cell cultures from dolphin skin; the analysis showed the importance of nonclassic functions of vitamin D3, such as its role in innate immunity, similar to what has been demonstrated in other mammals (Ellis et al., 2009). In 2014, a much more comprehensive system, a species-specific oligo microarray, containing 24,418 unigene sequences from cDNA libraries of seven different tissues from bottlenose dolphin was generated (Mancia et al., 2014). The microarray was used to screen wild animal blood transcriptomes and was effective in the differentiation of populations of dolphins inhabiting different geographic locations and by the effects of environmental contaminants on dolphin health (Mancia et al., 2014, Mancia et al., 2015). Dolphins inhabiting the coastal waters of Georgia in the United Statees, known to be heavily contaminated by Aroclor 1268 (Kucklick et al., 2011), an uncommon polychlorinated (PCB) mixture, displayed variation in expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, development/differentiation, and oncogenic pathways (Mancia et al., 2015). The same microarray was also applied to evaluate the skin tissue as a source of information, giving the minimal disruption inferred from the sampling methods (e.g., dart biopsy and/or stranding events). The skin was useful to evaluate the activation of an immune response to the exposure of contaminant of emerging concerns, such as bisphenol A and perfluorooctanoic acid (Lunardi et al., 2016) and also to establish baseline health parameters for investigations on contaminant exposure or health status. Gene expression was greatly impacted by season, with one-third of all the genes on the array varying between winter and summer, highlighting the need for creating a baseline for natural variability for a better investigation of the effects of a stressor (Van Dolah et al., 2015).",

The most recent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) method, in which the cDNA made from the RNA sample is directly sequenced through high-throughput DNA sequencing, provides a less biased evaluation of the transcriptome. RNA-seq analyses are very sensitive and offer the advantages of detecting all the unique sequences and of quantifying levels of RNAs expressed at a very low level. Most importantly, the reduced cost of RNA-seq provides an efficient approach to generate sequences for functional genomics analyses in a nonmodel organism with unsequenced genomes using a de novo assembly procedure (Gui et al., 2013). Gui et al. (2013) characterized the leucocyte transcriptome of the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin, now an endangered species because of the dramatic decline in population size of the past decades. The dataset provides a substantial genomic-level resource for the endangered species, while the identification of genetic markers and genes involved in immune system response and adaptive evolution can be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of various pathways in cetaceans.",

Results demonstrate that samples share distinct similarities sustaining the validity of the use of epidermal cell lines for the study of the interaction occurring between dolphins and the environment (Yu et al., 2005). Another example was a study investigating a dolphin condition similar to human metabolic syndrome using serum lipid profiles between two groups of dolphins, where high or low insulin were analyzed. The study found differences in phospholipid fatty acids in the two groups, which may play a role in the susceptibility to or development of an insulin-resistant-like state: the proteomic analysis of dolphin serum showed correlation of changes in the fatty acids with an insulin-sensitizing phenotype (Sobolesky et al., 2016).",

A study using tools relying on cross-hybridization between closely related species presented the blood transcriptome of the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) as a diagnostic classifier for rapid diagnosis and treatment of infection, disease, intoxication, or other causes of compromised health status in stranded animals (Mancia et al., 2012). The results achieved with this work indicate that cross-species microarray technologies, using a selected gene set for microarray design and analysis could be of use to wildlife managers and veterinarians in handling species with little genomic data. The California sea lion, a protected marine mammal inhabiting the western coast of North America, is a good sentinel species for coastal habitats, and the most common cause of stranding is reported to be domoic acid toxicosis, caused by the ingestion of domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin produced by diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nizschia. Human domoic acid intoxication cases present with abnormal behaviors, even seizures and epilepsy linked to hippocampal lesions, sharing the neuropathology profile observed in the California sea lions exposed to domoic acid, in particular in the recently discussed link between hippocampal lesions and epilepsy (Buckmaster et al., 2014, Ramsdell and Gulland, 2014). The blood transcriptomic analysis showed enrichment of pathways consistent with that neuropathology profile, confirmed by the analysis of the proteome of cerebrospinal fluid from intoxicated animals (Neely et al., 2015). Proteomic analysis of blood indicated that several apolipoprotein E charge forms decreased in domoic acid\u2013intoxicated sea lions and may be important in the progression of domoic acid toxicosis (Neely et al., 2015). The transcriptomic and the proteomic approaches taken, combined with machine learning approaches, performed as a robust and accurate tool to diagnose domoic acid toxicosis, demonstrating promise for future studies combining additional variables in multidimensional space to create robust classifiers (Mancia et al., 2012, Neely et al., 2015).",

In fact, data analysis was guided and/or supported by evaluation obtained by clinical observations and health parameters measurements carried out on the high number of unhealthy and ill cases that seasonally were hospitalized and rehabilitated at the Marine Mammal Center, in Sausalito, CA. Lately, the attention seems to be focused on different species, pinnipeds belonging to the family of the Phocidae, and to the understanding of the mechanisms activated by environmental chemical or biologic stress. Transcriptomics was used to evaluate brain tissues from stranded harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) to understand the cause of death. The study identified pathways involved in innate and adaptive immunity in samples with a phocine herpesvirus (PhV-1) brain infection and found a strong upregulation of fatty acid metabolic genes in animals that did not die from viral infection. Although the cause of the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism in the brains of these harbor seals is unknown, it may be correlated to exposure to toxins or nutrient depletion (Rosales and Vega Thurber, 2016). A de novo assembly of the blubber transcriptome in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) was used to identify molecular indicators of PCBs exposure. Transcript levels for gene targets were found to be correlated with increasing levels of blubber PCBs, linking an energy metabolism imbalance to the toxicity of the chemicals (Brown et al., 2017). Transcriptome analysis of muscle tissue of another member of the family Phocidae, the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), provides a resource for a deeper investigation of the alteration of molecular pathways triggered by environmental stress, including modifications of metabolic and immune signaling as well as muscle tissue maintenance (Khudyakov et al., 2015a). An example comes from a study of the cellular responses to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation by measuring corticosteroid hormones, metabolites, and muscle gene expression before, during, and following administration of exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); results suggests a compensatory, tissue-sparing mechanism used to maintain cortisol and aldosterone sensitivity while avoiding deleterious long-term consequences of stress (Khudyakov et al., 2015b). Reference sequences specific to elephant seals were also obtained from the blubber tissue and used to profile the transcriptomic response to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis activation and to identify tissue-specific molecular markers of stress in the pinniped fasting-adapted species (Khudyakov et al., 2017).\n",

Combining the study of multiple genes, proteins, and metabolites, the multiomics approach proved to be the correct one to understand the global picture of how each disease affects its host.

The small sample size used in the experimental setting caused by the protected status of marine mammals and by the cost of the techniques/sample can be a source of false discovery.

Metagenomic studies do not require prior information about the disease agents and allow detailed comparisons of health and disease, identifying new insights into the virome and microbiome of wildlife. Metagenomic studies of marine mammals focused on the viral and microbial community of many tissues and body niches have displayed a big diversity of the microbiota according to the organ type and may be used as a baseline survey for comparison with samples from stranded animals during unexplained disease outbreaks (Godoy-Vitorino et al., 2017). A viral metagenomic study to investigate potential viral pathogens associated with a mortality event of captive California sea lions identified a novel species-specific anellovirus (ZcAV) (Ng et al., 2009). A similar study on lung samples of the Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsii) revealed another novel seal anellovirus (SealAV), which clusters phylogenetically with anelloviruses from California sea lions and domestic cats (Ng et al., 2011). The description of ZcAV and SealAV in the lungs of pinnipeds suggests that anellovirus infections may be common and play a role in marine mammal health and disease. A different metagenomic study used next-generation sequencing to get a comprehensive view of the fecal viral populations from wild and temporarily captive California sea lions, reporting previously uncharacterized viruses, including astroviruses, picornaviruses, bocaviruses, and sapoviruses (Li et al., 2011). A metagenomic survey of viromes from feces of the Subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) and south American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) used next-generation sequencing to explore the viral diversity of southern hemisphere marine mammals (Kluge et al., 2016). A study of the bacterial communities in hundreds of samples from different body sites in healthy dolphins and sea lions showed a highly diverse bacterial taxonomic composition, which varies according to body site and host species (Bik et al., 2016). These findings provide species-specific databases that can be compared to later virome surveys and microbiota to detect alterations associated with changes in marine mammal health or population size.\n",

            "text": "Metagenomic studies in cetaceans have also indicated how the cetacean microbiome is affected by human-related bacteria (Godoy-Vitorino et al., 2017). This is particularly relevant since many human infections have a zoonotic, i.e., wild or domestic animal, origin. The rise in zoonotic diseases is driven by a complex interplay of environmental, ecologic, and epidemiologic factors. Therefore, the identification of pathogens in marine mammals may also moderate disease outbreaks and prevent zoonotic transmission (Delwart, 2012). Currently, there are about 15 known zoonotic marine mammal pathogens (Waltzek et al., 2012). The bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was introduced to the Americas via pinnipeds (Bos et al., 2014). The influenza A virus, a global human threat, is present in cetaceans and pinnipeds and has been shown to be transmitted from seals to humans (Geraci et al., 1982, Reperant et al., 2009, Webster et al., 1981). Most recent emerging diseases have been associated with host switches, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). The risk of being injured or acquiring zoonotic diseases is highest in marine mammal researchers, rehabilitators, trainers, veterinarians, and volunteers, but there also numerous recreational activities now permitting contact with these animals. Subsistence hunters such as whalers and sealers, as well as human rescuers during marine mammal stranding events, are at risk of disease acquisition through their direct physical contact with infected marine mammals or through the ingestion of marine mammal food products (Hunt et al., 2008, McLaughlin, 2004, Webster et al., 1981). Luckily, so far the majority of zoonotic marine mammal diseases have resulted in localized skin infections in man that resolved spontaneously or with appropriate medical therapy. However, other marine mammal zoonoses, if left untreated, could induce life-threatening systemic diseases that could pose public health risks.",

            "text": "An example is the astonishing wound healing mechanisms observed in dolphins. In humans, the healing of tissue wounds is often associated with infection and results in scars. Zasloff, a professor of immunology at the Georgetown University, observed the clinical course of the recovery of two dolphins showing shark\u2019s bites about 30 cm in length and 3 cm in depth (including the blubber layer and the underlying muscle). He reported that, during the first day postinjury, blubber from surrounding tissues had already migrated over the open wound surface. On the second day, newly generated tissues were described, which would gradually fill the wound from its base, restoring the original volume (Zasloff, 2011). The wound healed completely in 4 weeks and without any infections, which is remarkable considering the analogies between their immune system and that of terrestrial mammals (Beineke et al., 2010, Mancia et al., 2007). Zasloff suggested a role of the components of the dolphin blubber during the healing process. Stem cells present in the blubber could have a role in this remarkable wound healing process. The composition of dolphin\u2019s blubber is in fact different from other marine mammals: the isovaleric acid is higher in concentration, being 2%\u20135% of total fatty acid in bottlenose dolphin, while there is no detection in several species of whales (Koopman et al., 2003). The isovaleric acid accumulates in the blubber and does not get burned for fuel during times of starvation; moreover, it seems to have antimicrobial activity (Hayashida-Soiza et al., 2008). A multilayered omics approach describing transcripts, proteins, and metabolites present in the blubber after a serious injury may unravel the mechanisms involved in the healing process and in the protection from infection. Advances in the comprehension of the mechanisms controlling the healing process could lead to the improvement in the control of wound healing in humans and terrestrial mammals, leading to new therapies: regenerative medicine is an emerging field, with numerous open trials in the veterinary and human fields.",

People affected by metabolic syndrome can develop not only type II diabetes but also cardiovascular disease and the possibilities to have strokes. Like humans, dolphin can develop metabolic syndrome, characterized by elevated insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and ferritin (Venn-Watson et al., 2011, Venn-Watson et al., 2015). Fatty liver disease has been found both in wild dolphins and dolphins under human care, suggesting that dolphins are susceptible to metabolic disorders. A study compared a wild population of dolphins to one kept under human care, which have higher annual survival and lower mortality rates. A deep study into these animals\u2019 diets as a possible risk factor for longer life and metabolic disease highlighted the potential benefits of C17:0, the margaric or heptadecanoic acid, a saturated fatty acid also present in bovine milk fat. High levels of C17:0 on erythrocyte membranes or plasma phospholipids have been identified as protective factors against development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and associated inflammation (Venn-Watson et al., 2015). In a parallel study supported by proteomic analysis, differences in serum lipid profiles between two groups of dolphins, with high or low insulin, found differences in phospholipid fatty acids. Shifting the dolphin diet to fish rich in odd chain saturated fatty acids, such as C17:0, resulted in increased serum levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin and serum sphingosines consistent with an insulin-sensitizing phenotype (Sobolesky et al., 2016). A better understanding of the networks activated by the mechanisms regulating adiponectin in dolphins could aid research of metabolic syndrome and diabetes affecting human populations.",

            "text": "Each year, millions of individuals die or become ill because of conditions or diseases that reduce the oxygen supply to hypoxia-sensitive tissues such as the brain. Hypoxia is also involved in and is the cause of many neuronal disorders in humans, for example, Alzheimer disease (Peers et al., 2007), Parkinson disease (Speer et al., 2013), and cerebral ischemia (stroke). Acute metabolic insults like stroke have an especially devastating impact, which is mostly impossible to repair. By contrast, brains of diving mammals tolerate extended periods of systemic hypoxia without damage. There are several behavioral, anatomic, and physiologic adaptations that are associated with the remarkable dive capacity of many marine mammals (Davis, 2014) that may be partly explained on the genetic level by specific substitutions within the coding sequences (Foote et al., 2015) or by selective gene duplications and losses (Yim et al., 2014). Different studies used transcriptional analysis of the brain of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) and showed differential regulation of specific genes that may have a central role in the protection of the diving brain. In large parts, the seal brain responds to the hypoxic challenge in a similar way as the brain of other mammals, which includes the upregulation of typical stress proteins like cytokines and immediate early genes. However, the genes involved in the energy metabolism seem to be a specific response of the seal brain to hypoxia. These genes may also be suitable drug targets for human neuronal disorders associated with hypoxia (Fabrizius et al., 2016, Hoff et al., 2017).",

Since then, the bottlenose dolphin genome has been greatly implemented thanks to supplement of new high-throughput sequences data and to the newer high-coverage version of the genome. To date, genomes from nine species of marine mammals have been sequenced, annotated, and are publicly available at the NCBI database. Genome-guided transcriptome assembly as well as de novo transcriptome assembly are providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the variety and diversity of marine mammals, revealing novel genes, functions, and connections of molecular and physiologic mechanisms related to their adaptations, health, and disease.",

The study of the epigenome with the genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, and three-dimensional architecture and the integration of genome and epigenome, of the RNA information from coding (mRNA) and noncoding RNA (epigenetic-related RNAs, such as micro RNA, short interfering RNA, piwi-interacting RNA, and long noncoding RNA) are necessary to understand how environment and genetic inclinations can intertwine in the complexity of cell biology. The network and pathways observed can in predictive models identify potential risks and propose solutions, making the new technologies relevant as prognostic and diagnostic tools.",
