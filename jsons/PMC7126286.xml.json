They were homogenized in distilled water (6 ml/g) and the homogenate was centrifuged at 12 000 \u00d7 \ng for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and loaded on a 5 cm \u00d7 20 cm column of DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.2). Following removal of unadsorbed proteins in fraction D1, adsorbed proteins were eluted from the column with 0.2 M NaCl and then with 1 M NaCl added to the 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer, to yield fractions D2 and D3, respectively. Fraction D1 was applied to a column (5 cm \u00d7 18 cm) of Affi-gel blue gel (Bio-Rad) in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.2). Following elution of unadsorbed proteins in fraction B1, adsorbed proteins were desorbed initially with 0.2 M NaCl in the Tris\u2013HCl buffer to yield fraction B2, and subsequently with 1 M NaCl in the Tris\u2013HCl buffer to yield fraction B3. Fraction B2 was further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a column (2.5 cm \u00d7 20 cm) of SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 5.0). After elution of unadsorbed proteins (fraction S1), adsorbed proteins were desorbed with a linear concentration (0\u20131 M) gradient of NaCl. The fraction with antifungal activity (S2) was then further fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.5).

The assay makes use of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. Next, an antibody to digoxigenin conjugated to peroxidase binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. Finally, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the samples at 405 nm, which is directly correlated to the level of RT activity, can be measured with a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the isolated peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the peptide (Ng et al., 2002, Ng and Wang, 2001). The defensin gymnin (Wong and Ng 2003) was used as a positive control.",

This activity of cloud bean defensin may be a consequence of the protein synthesis inhibitory activity which is a characteristic of antifungal proteins (Ng and Ye 2003) including ribosome inactivating proteins (Ng and Parkash 2002). It is noteworthy that cloud bean defensin is inhibitory to both L1210 and MBL2 tumor cells.
