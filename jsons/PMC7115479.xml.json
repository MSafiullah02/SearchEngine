Treatment of the 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-\u03b1-D-ribo-hexofuranos-3-ulose (1) [32] with sodium cyanide in a two-phase ethylether/H2O system, in the presence of sodium bicarbonate, afforded the thermodynamically more stable gluco cyanohydrin epimer 2, in a virtually quantitative yield [33], [34]. The assignment of its configuration was further supported by NOE measurements, as depicted in Fig. 1\n. A 5% NOE enhancement of H-2 and a 7% NOE enhancement of H-5 on irradiation of the proton of the free OH group show that these protons are on the same side of the ring system. Hydrolysis of 2 using Amberlite IR 120 (H+) resin in methanol followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride (Ac2O) in pyridine [32] led to the 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-3-C-cyano-D-glucopyranose (4).

The 1H NMR spectra obtained for the protected nucleosides 5a\u2013d, showed large coupling constants between protons H-1\u2032 and H-2\u2032 (J\n1\u2032,2\u2032 = 9.4\u20139.6 Hz), indicating an axial orientation of both protons and equatorially oriented base rings. Fully deprotection of 5a\u2013d, performed by saturated methanolic ammonia [36], gave the desired nucleosides 6a\u2013d.",

Phenoxythiocarbonylation of 2 under a commonly used condition, phenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et3N) in CH3CN [16], afforded the 3\u2032-O-phenoxythiocarbonyl derivative 7, which proved to be unstable during the purification process. Therefore, crude 7 was directly submitted to deoxygenation with Bu3SnH in the presence of 2,2\u2032-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), to give the 3\u2032-deoxy derivative sugar 8, in 76% overall yield. In order to elucidate the structure of the newly synthesized 8, NOE measurements were performed, as depicted in Fig. 1. The mutual NOE enhancements observed between H-2 with both H-1 and H-3 show that all these protons are in the same \u03b2 face of the furanose ring. In this type of radical deoxygenation, the hydrogen atom enters from the less hindered, \u03b2-face of the planar radical intermediate, opposite to the bulky 1,2-O-isopropylidene group.",
