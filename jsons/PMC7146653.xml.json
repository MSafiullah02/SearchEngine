Screening entry points is another critical step in attempting to prevent introduction of the disease. This requires knowledge of the nature of the infectious disease and local societal entry points and systems. For COVID-19, all patients entering the facility are questioned on origin, destination, close contact with sick individuals, and current symptoms. Identification of symptoms by either medical or nonmedical personnel is possible. In medical resource-constrained environments, it may be necessary to train nonmedical personnel to perform basic medical functions like screening. Centralized suspected exposure reporting is required, with any suspected individuals calling or reporting to designated locations where medical personnel can don personal protective equipment (PPE) and clinically assess the probability of infection (Fig. 1\n).",

Ideally, cohorts of people should enter and be isolated in groups to ensure people entering quarantine together are not potentially contaminated by others entering quarantine later. If others enter the quarantine cohort later, the quarantine duration should reset. Cohort quarantine may not be possible due to limitations in housing and support for multiple individual groups. If possible, entry into the population by new people should be batched based off the duration of required quarantine. For example, with COVID-19, individuals would only be able to join the population every 14 days to allow for the previous quarantined cohort to vacate the segregated infrastructure for quarantined personnel. When this cannot be supported and individuals will join at various dates, the best option we have found is \u201crestriction of movement.\u201d6 During restriction of movement, at-risk populations are segregated only to certain locations at specific times as best as possible, to reduce exposure at communal points such as recreation, hygiene (bathing and toilet), and dining facilities. Particularly high-risk populations (known exposure, travel from high-risk countries, etc) will go into traditional quarantine. Self-monitoring and personnel tracking are ongoing during restriction of movement, and any signs of infection are immediately reported.",

Each leg of the evacuation route must be approved by the host country and may require political engagement with the host nation through Department of State representatives. Exposure risks to clinicians, pilots, and other crew members en route, especially if they have underlying health conditions that predispose them to complications from COVID-19 infection, must factor into planning, especially if they are being transported in an aircraft not normally configured for medical evacuation. Pre-movement intubation and establishment of a deliberate airway may be needed before movement.",

These teams are built for damage control surgery and rapid evacuation and therefore, are not equipped for long-term inpatient care. Other small teams with specific missions may be in a similar situation that requires using equipment and skills for a different purpose. The first step is to inventory all equipment and identify a means of monitoring, supporting, and treating the likely life-threatening disease process. For COVID-19, respiratory failure is the greatest immediate threat to life. To support this process, a source of oxygen, ventilation, nutrition, and hydration is required. Identify how each requirement can be met, even if it would not be standard in a high resource environment. For example, the authors\u2019 team considered that when sedation runs out, emergency cricothyroidotomy kits would be required to serve as tracheostomies. Feeding could be done through open gastric tubes using excess rubber catheters if nasogastric tubes are unavailable. Expected populations to be treated at various severities should be identified, and additional supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be acquired as soon as possible. Finally, a limit to what can be done must be identified and, if required, triage of medical resources needs to be evaluated by the medical team. In our team, we can only provide a maximum of 45% to 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and are limited in means to treat sepsis, multiorgan failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If a patient exceeds the capabilities, resources may have to be shunted to any additional patients who have a more survivable disease process.",

They do require assessment, but this can be done face-to-face, verbally, virtually, by phone or e-mail if the patient remains clinically stable.

If medical treatment team members are infected, they should remain on duty as long as physically able, but will be restricted to the isolated population. If excess medical providers are present, treatment teams should be identified, and only those on the treatment teams should be permitted in the tent. When members of the treatment team are infected, the healthy remaining team members can fill in the gaps; this will help prevent continuous exposure to all medical personnel.
