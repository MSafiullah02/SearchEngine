In HD rooms, it is not always possible to maintain the recommended safety distance of about 2 meters (S2), and patients cannot always tolerate the surgical mask for long periods of time. Due to the high incidence of patients and healthcare professionals with COVID-19 symptoms, we decided to perform a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in all asymptomatic patients of the 4 outpatient HD centers: of these, 18% (33/188) were found positive. Before performing nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2, patients underwent dialysis sessions in the same rooms and although healthcare professionals wore the appropriate PPE, but not the PPE reserved for patients known to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Upon receiving swab results, we embarked on a different strategy. We transferred all patients who tested positive from the satellite centres to the hospital centre and created three distinct areas for patients on HD treatment: one for positive asymptomatic, one for positive symptomatic and one for negative (Figure 5\n). After having deployed these preventive measures, we had no more cases of COVID-19 among the previously negative patients and among the healthcare staff. Four patients with positive swab subsequently developed symptoms for COVID-19.",
