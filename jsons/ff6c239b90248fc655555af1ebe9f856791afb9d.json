            "text": "Enterovirus 68 (EV68) was first isolated in 1962. Very few cases of EV68 infection were described over the ensuing 40 years. However, in the past few years, an increase in severe respiratory tract infections associated with EV68 has been reported. We identified two clusters of EV68 infection in South London, UK, one each in the autumn/winters of 2009 and 2010. Sequence comparison showed significant homology of the UK strains with those from other countries including the Netherlands, Japan and the Philippines, which reported EV68 outbreaks between 2008 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of all available VP1 sequences indicated the presence of two modern EV68 lineages. The 2010 UK strains belonged to lineage 2. Lineage 1 could be further divided into two sub-lineages: some Japanese and Dutch strains collected between 2004 and 2010 form a distinct sub-lineages (sub-lineage 1.1), whereas other strains from the UK, Japan, Netherlands and Philippines collected between 2008 and 2010 represent sub-lineage 1.2. The UK 2009 strains together with several Dutch and Japanese strains from 2009/2010 represents one variant (1.2.1), whereas those from the Philippines a second variant (1.2.2). Based on specific deletions and substitutions, we suggest rules for the assignment of lineages and sub-lineages. Molecular epidemiological analysis indicates rapid recent evolution of EV68 and this may explain the recent findings of a global resurgence of EV68. Continuous global monitoring of the clinical and molecular epidemiology of EV68 is recommended. Citation: Lauinger IL, Bible JM, Halligan EP, Aarons EJ, MacMahon E, et al.

            "text": "Enterovirus 68 (EV68) is a unique virus in the enterovirus genus as it shares characteristics with rhinoviruses, such as infection of the respiratory tract and acid lability [1] . EV68 does not follow the usual summer-autumn seasonality observed for most other enterovirus species [2] , although a recent outbreak in the Netherlands occurred in the autumn of 2010 between September and November [3] . It was first isolated from throat swabs collected from four hospitalised children in 1962 in the USA [4] and together with EV70 and EV94, was classified as enterovirus species D. Rhinovirus 87 was found to be identical to EV68 and reclassified into enterovirus species D [1, 5, 6] . Apart from respiratory tract infections, EV68 has also been implicated in some rare cases of fatal central nervous system infection [2, 7] . An American surveillance system reported the most common age group affected by EV68 to be children aged between 1 and 4 years, but noted that about a quarter of all infections were reported in adults [2] . A more recent study found .50% of all EV68 infections occurred in adults over the age of 40 [3] .",

Enterovirus surveillance in the USA between 1970 and 2005 showed that EV68 was one of the most rarely reported serotype with 26 reports observed over 36 years of surveillance in USA [2] . However, in the last few years between 2008 and 2010, an increasing number of clusters of acute respiratory illness associated with EV68 were reported in Asia, Europe, and the USA [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] . Some recent observations of increase in cases could be partly due to enhanced surveillance in patients with asthma [1] . However, a review of recent EV68 reports suggested that the increase may not be entirely accounted for by reporting bias, as reports have come independently from countries in different continents over the same period and some countries, like USA and Japan, have been conducting continuous enterovirus surveillance for many years. A retrospective study in the Netherlands using samples dating back to 1996 confirmed the re-emergence of EV68 [3] . In many cases, EV68 was the sole enterovirus serotype detected and was associated with severe or even fatal disease (Table S1) .",

They both showed a high degree of homology to the prototype Fermon strain from 1962 (.95.3%) and the full length French strain 37-99 from 1998 (.97.5%). However, the 2010 59NTR sequences showed more divergence in comparison to recent Filipino sequences from (Figure 1 ). Comparing the sequence from 2009 and 2010 showed the presence of eight nucleotide variations between the two years in the 59NTR ( Table 2) . Several of these mutations are reported for the first time (T318C and C319T in 2010, and A495G in 2009 sequences, using the Fermon strain as reference). In addition, two blocks of deletions (681-704 and 717-727) were noted in the 59NTR among the more recently reported Japanese isolates from the literature compared to the Fermon strain [11] . Our 2009 and 2010 strains also had these deletions although the islet region between the two deletion blocks (705-716) differed in at least 5 out of 12 nucleotides compared to the Japanese strains ( Figure 2) . Additionally, whereas the 2009 UK strains had both deletion blocks (681-703 and 717-728), the 2010 strains (including 09-70) only had the deletion between 681-704. Whether or not these deletion blocks occurred in other EV68 strains is not known, as other EV68 59NTR sequences reported in the GenBank were not extended to cover this pre-VP4 region of the 59NTR. VP4/VP2. The VP4/VP2 region showed a much greater difference between the two clusters (87.4%-89.7% nucleotide similarities) but retained a high conservation in the protein (97.9%-98.6% amino acid similarities). The UK 2009 sequences had a high degree of homology to 6 other Japanese sequences from 2010 ( Figure 3 ). For example, the Yamagata 2035 strain from 2010 was 98.4% similar to the UK 09-398 strain, but only 89.2% similar to the UK 10-268 strain. On the other hand, the UK 2010 sequences were more similar to another cluster of Japanese strains from the same year ( Figure 3 ). For example, the Yamagata 2076 strain also from 2010 was 98.1% similar to the UK 10-268 strain, but only 90.0% similar to the UK 09-398 strain. The UK 2010 sequences also showed a high degree of homology to some older European sequences. The 2008 Swiss F91-1008-U strain showed 98.6% and the 2008 Italian Pav250-20260 strain 98.0% similarity to UK 10-268 strain. The corresponding homology to the UK 09-398 strain was 90.7% and 91.0% respectively. Overall, the amino acid composition in the VP4 protein (1-69) showed a high degree of conservation (only change was I19V in Yamaguchi/Yu/50.10). In the VP2 region, there were only four amino acid changes compared to the Fermon strain ( Figure 4) . Interestingly, whereas UK 2009 strains showed the same substitutions as the 1998 French and 2010 Japanese JPOC strains (S142A and N143G), the UK 2010 isolates have different substitutions at these positions (S142T and N143E). All other available sequences were not extended to cover this region.",

            "text": "The epidemiology of EV68 is intriguing. It was first described in 1962 [4] but in the ensuing 40 years, it was reported only sporadically despite regular enterovirus surveillance by public health bodies [2] . Over the last decade, and particularly in the last few years, the number of reports of EV68 increased dramatically and in some cases severe respiratory tract infections [3, 8, 9, 11, 13] and even central nervous system infections [2, 7] were reported. An increase in detection rate may be due to improved testing methods or an increase in multiplex molecular testing of respiratory samples as a result of enhanced respiratory virus surveillance. However, it is not possible to discount the possibility that EV68 is an emerging pathogen. A recent study retrospectively investigated the molecular evolution of EV68 in the VP1 region with time [3] and showed that the original Fermon strain and clusters of selected older sequences (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) disappeared over time with subsequent emergence and increase in number of recent strains. The presence of three separate lineages of EV68 has been proposed, but not all available EV68 strains were used in that study [3] . We, however, performed more detailed analyses, adding new sequences from the UK from 2009 and 2010, and including all available EV68 sequences from the GenBank covering 59NTR, VP4/VP2 as well as VP1.",

It is also possible that the prevalence of the EV68 strains in each country is dictated by the local herd immunity. A study in Finland has shown a high population seroprevalence of EV68 [17] . Hence, EV68 has been circulating in the community for many years. The lack of previous detection may be due to the presence of many transient and sub-clinical infections which were not tested. EV68 is an RNA virus with known potential of undergoing antigenic change. This study corroborates previous evidence that a rapid change is occurring in EV68, as reported for other human enteroviruses such as EV71 and echovirus 30 [18, 19, 20] .",

So far, no evidence of inter-typic recombination between 59NTR and VP1 was observed from our limited sequence data and that in the literature ( Figure S6 ). Only few studies of EV68 have investigated multiple genomic regions (Table S2 ) which greatly restricted the analysis of inter-typic and inter-lineage recombination. No bootstrap supported clustering between the lineages could be identified in the 59NTR due to the high conservation in this region which prevented the analysis of inter-lineage recombination between 59NTR and VP1. No evidence of inter-lineage recombination of strains was observed on analysis of available sequences covering VP4/VP2 and VP1 (n = 70). Apart from the 4 full genome sequences, only the American sequences (n = 15, cover the 3D polymerase region.

First two letters of sequences are collection year, followed by letters for the country of origin. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036005.g003 sequences from the older Swiss and Italian strains from 2008 were available for comparison. Both the 2009 and 2010 UK VP1 sequences diverged significantly from the prototype Fermon strain (maximal homology of 88.1% and 89.3% respectively), but were closer to another earlier full genome sequence from France (strain 37-99 from 1998 -93.5% and 91.8% maximal homology respectively). All Filipino sequences from 2008/2009, including the ones which clustered closely with the UK 2009 sequences at the 59NTR, form a distinct cluster at the VP1 region, the separate branching of which was supported by a bootstrap value of 98 (Figure S2). A three nucleotide deletion (ATG), resulting in the deletion of glycine at position 141 in the VP1 protein (Figure S4)[13], was noted for all UK 2010 strains and all strains clustering closely, including strains from the Netherlands(2001-2010), USA (2003), Finland (2004/2005) and Japan (2006-2010). Lineages Phylogenetic analysis of all available VP1 sequences showed that all modern EV68 strains were derived from two separate lineages, supported by a bootstrap value of 88 (Figure 5). The 2010 UK EV68 strains (including 09-70) share the same lineage as some of the 2006-2010 Dutch and 2010 Japanese strains. This we will refer to as lineage 2. Characteristic for this lineage is the glycine deletion in position 141 in the VP1 protein. Additionally, the amino acid change at position 142 and 143 to threonine and glutamic acid in the VP2 protein could also be linked to this lineage. The presence of the one deletion block (681-704) in the 59NTR is also a characteristic feature. Additional sequences covering this region are required for verification; however 2010 isolates from Yamagata which clustered within lineage 2 have limited sequence data available which suggest the absence of the second deletion block (717-727) (Figure S5). Lineage 1, on the other hand, can be divided into further sublineages. One branch of this lineage consisted of a number of Dutch strains (2004-2009) and Japanese isolates from Yamagata and Osaka (2005-2010) (sub-lineage 1.1). The UK 2009 EV68 strains also share the same lineage with some of the 2009/2010 Dutch and Japanese strains (variant 1.2.1), but are distinct from another branch consisting of the 2008/2009 Filipino isolates (variant 1.2.2). All these branches were supported by a strong bootstrap value .92. The nucleotide and amino acid homologies between the lineages, sub-lineages and variants were shown in Tables 5 and 6. The two variants showed 96%-98% nucleotide similarities with each other, compared to 89%-95% with sublineage 1.1 and 84%-93% with lineage 2. Similarly, sub-lineage 1.1 shared 85%-92% with lineage 2. Within each lineage, the similarity was between 95%-100%. Whereas in the UK, the two lineages predominated in different years (lineage 1.2.1 in 2009 and lineage 2 in 2010), in other countries such as the Netherlands and",
