He desires that this new city address unsanitary conditions evident in his native country, France. Of note, his designs include a preference that health care is delivered in the home. Recognizing that an acute care hospital would still be needed, he specified that this be limited to 20 to 30 beds per ward but that each room be a single-patient room with attached bathroom. In addition, the structure was to be disposable (meaning made of pinewood) with no carpet or wallpaper and incinerated at the end of the year of use. This article shows that Verne was prescient in that many of these design elements, except for the disposable nature of the built environment, have been incorporated into contemporary guidelines.",

This spectrum of spaces and surfaces collectively is referred as the environment of care (EOC). In general, these are less frequently a source of microorganisms causing health care\u2013associated infection (HAI) compared with other sources, such as the patient's endogenous microflora, especially when an invasive device is present, or a surgical procedure.2 Carriage of microbes on hands of health care personnel (HCP) also is a more likely mechanism of exposure to potential pathogens. Even so, the proportional contribution of the EOC as a reservoir of pathogens is estimated at 20%.3 Over the past several years there have been several studies showing that the EOC is a significant source of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), Clostridium difficile, and norovirus.4 In addition, investigation of the role of the EOC has found that admission to a patient room previously occupied by a patient with an MDRO or C difficile is a risk factor for their acquisition by the next occupant.5\n",

This distribution network readily supports development of biofilm, and the microbial contaminants embedded in this matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, mainly composed of exopolysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids, protects microorganisms from disinfectants that are otherwise effective against planktonic forms.12 Stagnant water in this network, often from renovation of areas in the facility that has resulted in redundant lengths of pipework that are left in place and capped, also enhances development of biofilm. In addition, disruption of water utility systems during construction or renovation can disrupt biofilm and release contaminants into the water delivery network, posing a possible risk to patients, including those far away from the work area.",

The 2 primary methods HCP use to clean their hands are alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) or soap and water and a handwashing station. Hota and colleagues14 reported an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections that, ironically, centered on handwashing stations in intensive care units (ICUs) and transplant units. The outbreak unit featured single-occupancy patient rooms with convenient access to a handwashing station near the entrance in each for use by HCP. Biofilm within the drains of these were identified as the source and the sink design included a shallow basin with the faucet spout directly over the drain. This arrangement resulted in splashes of water contaminated with P aeruginosa out of the drain contaminating surfaces near the sink, including a medication preparation area and the patient bed. Interventions to mitigate contamination from sinks included a physical barrier between the sink and adjacent countertops, offset of the faucet spout so it did not discharge directly into the drain, and lower water pressure. The lessons from this outbreak have been incorporated into guidelines published by the Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI).15 Key design features in current FGI guidelines include:\u2022Basins that reduce the risk of splashing and are made of porcelain, stainless steel, or other solid surface material\u2022Basin size of no less than 929.08 cm2 (144 square inches) with 22.86 cm2 (9 square inches) width or length\u2022Sealed to prevent water intrusion into supporting cabinet, wall, and countertop\u2022Discharge of water from faucet spout is at least 25.4 cm (10 inches) above the bottom of the basin and avoids dropping directly into the drain\u2022Water pressure in station fixture is regulated\u2022Allows controls for sink fixture to be wrist blade, single lever, or sensor activated\n",

There are several antimicrobial treatments that have been applied to inanimate surfaces; nonporous and soft surfaces such as textiles and privacy curtains. The types of antimicrobial treatments include photoreactive substances that release antimicrobials when exposed to natural sunlight, heavy metals like copper and silver, organosilane, triclosan, and quaternary ammonium compound. There is suggestive evidence that many of these can reduce the concentration of microorganisms on environmental surfaces.30 Direct evidence that these treatments reduce the incidence of HAIs in which transmission from the inanimate EOC is involved is lacking. This lack of evidence reflects the complex environment in an acute care facility given the myriad of sources by which personnel can contaminate their hands (eg, shared equipment) so treating several surfaces in a room may still not be more effective than processes and real-time feedback to personnel who clean and disinfect the built environment. Guidance is available for some of the surfaces and finishes being planned for health care facilities. Highlights of these include31:1.Nonupholstered surfaces should be capable of being easily cleaned; minimize surface joints and seams.2.Upholstered surfaces used in patient-care areas should be impervious (nonporous); untreated (non\u2013high performance) woven fabrics should not be used. Upholstered surfaces should be durable and resist tearing, peeling, cracking, or splitting; damaged surfaces are more difficult to clean effectively. Upholstered furniture in patient-care areas should be covered with fabrics that are fluid-resistant, nonporous, and can withstand cleaning with hospital-grade disinfectants.\n",
