Because of the varied presentations and the difficulty in the establishment of a definitive diagnosis, the true incidence of myocarditis is unknown.

However, due to the difficulty in assessing encephalopathy in young children and the recognition that terminal liver failure can occur in the absence of clinical encephalopathy, the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study (PALF) group has accepted the diagnosis of ALF in children with no history of chronic liver disease who present with biochemical evidence of acute liver injury and severe hepatic-based coagulopathy regardless of the presence or absence of hepatic encephalopathy.28 The causes of ALF in children can be metabolic, toxic, drug-related, immune-mediated or infectious. The percentage of ALF caused by viral infections varies significantly by age group and geographic location, with infections causing only 6% of ALF in a large pediatric series from North America and Great Britain28., 29. but 50% in a series from South America.30\n",

Infection with hepatitis C rarely causes ALF; however, there are case reports of ALF with both postnatally and perinatally acquired hepatitis C in children.28., 35., 36. In 2006, PALF published a report of the first 348 children presenting with ALF to the study sites throughout North America and Great Britain. Only 6% of the cases in this series had definitive viral causes, with the viruses identified being adenovirus, CMV, hepatitis A, enterovirus, HSV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis C. However, both in this series and in a later series of 703 children published by the same group, almost 50% of all the cases were indeterminate, due at least in part to lack of a complete diagnostic workup.29 It is likely that some of these indeterminate cases were also due to undiagnosed infectious causes. Additional viruses that have been implicated in ALF include hepatitis D and E, parvovirus,37., 38. varicella-zoster virus (VZV),39 and HHV-6.40., 41. ALF in infants is most likely to be associated with systemic illness due to enterovirus, echovirus, HSV, HHV-6, or CMV.28., 42., 43., 44. While most perinatally acquired infections with hepatitis B are asymptomatic, infants born to women with both HBsAg and anti-HBeAb appear to be at greater risk for ALF due to perinatally acquired hepatitis B.45\n",

In children younger than 5 years, influenza can cause symptoms of laryngotracheobronchitis, whereas pneumonia occurs in 10% to 15% of those younger than 3 years. Finally, older children generally exhibit the classic flulike symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise with upper respiratory tract symptoms. Bacterial superinfection is a common and potentially severe complication of influenza. Among immunocompromised patients, risk factors for more severe disease and progression to the lower respiratory tract include lymphopenia and infection early after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.65., 68.

The overall attack rate was highest among children aged 5 to 14 years (147 per 100,000 population),69 but infants had the highest hospitalization rates and persons aged 50 years or older had the highest mortality rates once hospitalized.69., 71. This differs from seasonal influenza, where about 60 percent of influenza-related hospitalizations and 90 percent of influenza-related deaths occur in people 65 years and older. From April to October of 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received reports of 145 pediatric deaths associated with influenza infection.67 Correcting for under-ascertainment, the CDC estimates the actual count may be three to four times greater than reported (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm).

The SARS outbreak originated in Guangdong Province in China in the fall of 2002 and was characterized by a life-threatening, atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus most likely derived from masked palm civets.105 SARS-CoV was spread by close contact with infected humans, mostly to household contacts and health care workers. Death from progressive respiratory failure occurred in approximately 10% to 15% of adult patients106., 107., 108., 109., 110.; in children, morbidity was less and no deaths occurred.111., 112., 113. SARS-CoV is not currently circulating in the world. The most recent human cases of SARS-CoV infection were reported in China in April 2004 in an outbreak resulting from laboratory-acquired infections.114 Should SARS-CoV re-emerge, updates to the case definition, including clinical criteria for moderate or severe respiratory illness of unknown cause and epidemiologic criteria for exposure, can be found at www.cdc.gov/SARS.

CMV is a herpesvirus and, like other herpesviruses, it can cause latent infection in vascular endothelial cells, monocytes and macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and renal and pulmonary epithelial cells. Cellular damage is caused directly by the viral lytic infection or indirectly by the immune response of the host. Among allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, the risk of CMV pneumonia is high; historically, treatment of CMV pneumonia with ganciclovir and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the late 1980s dramatically reduced mortality from 80% to 100% without therapy to approximately 50%.120 The spectrum of CMV pneumonia has changed with the introduction of routine antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy strategies.121 As a result, CMV disease during the first 3 months after hematopoietic cell transplantation has been reduced from 20% to 30% to less than 5% in most studies.122 CMV disease now primarily occurs late after transplant. Risk factors for late CMV disease include reactivation of (or primary infection with) CMV during the early period after transplant, and therapy for acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease.120 Among solid organ transplant recipients, the risk of CMV disease is greatest for lung transplant recipients, followed by liver, heart, and renal transplant recipients.120., 123.\n",

Travel or residence in areas where arboviruses are endemic during the appropriate season for arthropod transmission (typically summer months) and a history or evidence of insect bites should raise suspicion for arboviruses. Seasonality also plays a role in enteroviral diseases, because in temperate climates enteroviruses are more prevalent during summer and fall months. History of a mother with recent symptoms consistent with viral illness (fever, sore throat, gastroenteritis, rash) should raise suspicion of enterovirus in a neonate with encephalitis or sepsis-like illness.

The results of brain computed tomography (CT) and MRI studies are usually normal in viral meningitis, whereas disease is often seen in the setting of viral encephalitides. In general, CT scan is relatively insensitive for detecting acute encephalitis. MRI is the more sensitive study for detecting disease because of its ability to detect altered water content (see Chapter 56).156 In acute viral encephalitis, early findings include edema with minimal contrast enhancement. As disease progresses, edema and enhancement become more obvious and may be accompanied by mass effect, hemorrhagic changes, and necrosis. As the inflammation resolves, atrophy may become prominent. In HSV, imaging studies may reveal edema and enhancement, often first involving the temporal lobes with subsequent spread to other areas of the brain. Changes can ultimately progress to atrophy, multicystic encephalomalacia, and gyriform high attenuation, especially in children.157., 158. In postinfectious encephalomyelitis, the lesions may be seen throughout the CNS. The lesions are more readily elucidated by MRI and primarily involve the white matter, although gray matter may also be involved.",

However, by the time the patient has developed lower respiratory tract disease, a lower respiratory sample by bronchoscopy may provide the best yield and may be positive even with a negative nasopharyngeal sample. The sensitivity of indirect immunofluorescence assays is generally as high as 90% to 95% for RSV, influenza A and B, and PIV 1, 2, and 3; if a rapid result is needed, this may be the best approach. However, PCR may be used if the results can be provided in an expedited fashion, as this is a more sensitive assay albeit more expensive. A rapid antigen test for RSV and influenza is also available. However, for the pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, in particular, FA and rapid testing have shown low sensitivity and a negative test result is not reliable.167., 168., 169., 170. PCR testing is most sensitive and necessary for correct virus subtype identification. Adenovirus immunofluorescence assays are available in some laboratories, but sensitivity is generally lower (around 50% to 70%). Shell vial assays can increase sensitivity, and although they are usually performed for CMV, they can also be performed for RSV and adenovirus. The same samples can be sent for culture in addition to immunofluorescence studies; this should be considered for immunocompromised and severely ill children with respiratory distress/failure of unclear etiology if PCR testing is not available. The diagnosis of hantavirus can be made by culture of the virus (which is difficult), PCR for viral RNA from serum, plasma, or tissues, or serologic testing.

Seasonal H3N2 viruses have shown almost universal resistance to adamantanes since the 2005\u20132006 season, and seasonal H1N1 viruses have shown rising oseltamivir resistance since 2008\u20132009.193 Seasonal H1N1 viruses typically remain sensitive to adamantanes and zanamavir.
