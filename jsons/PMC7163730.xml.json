In the 19th century, John Snow (1855) systematically traced cholera mortalities to a shared London water pump in what is now often recognized as the first published epidemiological study (Evans 1976). At the time, Snow and his contemporaries were largely unaware of the ecological dynamics that led naturally occurring aquatic bacteria (Vibrio cholerae) to cause epidemic disease. Snow used scientific inquiry based on observations and an implicit spatiotemporal clustering model to demonstrate a connection between cholera cases and water supplies. Today we know that V. cholerae occurs naturally in copepod hosts across many aquatic environments (Colwell 1996) and that the ecology of these copepod communities is an essential component of managing and forecasting cholera epidemics in humans (Lipp et al. 2002, Colwell et al. 2003).",

However, even with the extraordinary advances in data availability, computational power, and algorithms for stochastic modeling, fusing data with mechanistic understanding in ways that allow for forecasts in advance of epidemics remains a major challenge (Ostfeld et al. 2005, Kitron et al. 2006, Glass 2007), and is especially problematic in the case of emergent infectious diseases.",

Several recent studies have demonstrated that reported EIDs have increased in recent decades and that a majority of EIDs are zoonotic (vertebrate reservoir) and vector\u2010borne (Taylor et al. 2001, Wilcox and Gubler 2005, Jones et al. 2008). Following declines in the mid\u201020th century, mortalities in the United States attributed to infectious diseases began to rise in the 1980s, an increase that has been blamed on the spread of HIV and related infections (reviewed by Greger 2007). It is likely that exponential growth of the human population and human resource consumption (Daszak et al. 2000), globalization of travel and trade (Karesh et al. 2005), and changes in climate (Pascual and Bouma 2009) have already and will continue to facilitate this rise in EIDs.",

Pathogen transmission involves the interaction of at least two organisms (Fig. 1) and is inherently a spatiotemporal process (Antolin 2008). It is also a process that cannot be directly observed. Unobservable processes are difficult to model because estimation of latent parameters relies on our ability to accurately relate them to quantities that can be measured. Available data are often discrete, while the underlying processes are continuous in nature. Numerous approaches have been employed to estimate transmission rates and predict disease intensity from observed disease incidence (i.e., successful transmission events for a fixed spatial and temporal interval). A majority of advances in understanding infectious dynamics have been made in endemic diseases with direct human\u2010to\u2010human transmission because data and understanding of human population dynamics are generally available (Anderson and May 1992, Bolker and Grenfell 1995, Bjornstad et al. 2002, Ferrari et al. 2008, He et al. 2010). Systems that include zoonotic reservoir hosts and vector transmission are more complex than directly transmitted human diseases and require some understanding of the ecological dynamics controlling host and vector populations, as well as the factors that influence disease incidence (Yates et al. 2002, Ostfeld et al. 2006, Begon et al. 2009). Sick animals are not easily studied in their natural environment and the historical time series that have supported many advances in infectious disease research (e.g., Anderson and May 1992) do not exist for wildlife populations or for newly emergent diseases.",

Dynamic compartmental models, a common model\u2010based approach in epidemiology, employ a linked system of differential equations to represent susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered states (i.e., SEIR) in order to characterize transmission and disease progression in host populations (Anderson and May 1992). Data are not generally integrated formally with these mathematical process equations, instead critical parameter estimates are derived from other analyses and plugged into the model.

            "text": "A primary goal of compartmental modeling in epidemiology is estimation of the basic reproductive number, R\n0, the number of new infections created by a single infected individual in a wholly susceptible population. Theoretically, an epidemic can only proceed if R\n0 is greater than 1 (Anderson and May 1985). The parameter estimates that characterize disease transmission can be adjusted to explore how changes in these rates alter the probability that an epidemic will occur as well as its probable duration. Dynamic compartmental models can be valuable tools for assessing the relative importance of critical rates and have been crucial for evaluating vaccination strategies (Anderson and May1985) and controlling emerging human epidemics such as SARS, which we review later. The mathematical structure reflects several underlying biological assumptions, including the nature of transmission and the constancy of rate parameters in time and space. When these assumptions are not correct then the resulting R0 values can be off by orders of magnitude (e.g., Wonham et al. 2006). Limitations associated with mathematical modeling of infectious transmission have been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Wearing et al. 2005). These models can be very powerful if the biological processes are well defined and demographic and environmental stochasticity are either well\u2010characterized or unimportant for meeting the goal of the research (Hohle et al. 2005, Britton and Lindenstrand 2009, He et al. 2010). However, capturing the stochasticity is especially important when the research goal is to forecast the timing and intensity of disease outbreaks. Recent \u201cplug\u2010and\u2010play\u201d methods use simulations from flexible classes of compartmental models to generate understanding of complex interactions and stochasticity in dynamic systems (Ionides et al. 2006, He et al. 2010), but currently are applied to understanding direct (human) transmission processes with relatively rich data. Dynamic compartmental modeling may be particularly limited when data are sparse and biological understanding poor, especially when forecasting infectious dynamics of vector\u2010borne and zoonotic disease systems is the goal.",

            "text": "Data\u2010based or phenomenological modeling of disease incidence has strengths and weaknesses complementary to dynamic mathematical models. Advances in remote sensing have greatly increased the amount and scale of data available to characterize environmental variables that can influence the timing and location of disease outbreaks (Kitron et al. 2006). Observed disease incidence (or host or pathogen abundance) can be readily compared to a suite of variables representing habitat type (Xiao et al. 2007, Brown et al. 2008), climate (Brownstein et al. 2003, Xiao et al. 2007), and dispersal pathways (Kilpatrick et al. 2006a\n). These data\u2010based methods can certainly capture the heterogeneity in population abundance and infection dynamics, but may not have enough biological integrity to extend beyond the unique time and place in which data were collected. Phenomenological models tend to rely on the assumption that the abiotic features measured actually determine disease incidence. When the disease is in the process of expanding in range, the abiotic conditions that match its current range might represent only a small subset of those that permit its existence. Thus, the potential for these types of approaches to provide accurate or useful forecasts of disease incidence relies on how well they capture the underlying biological processes that determine transmission rates, which can be difficult to evaluate. Still, phenomenological modeling has undoubtedly provided important insight into the distribution and spread of infectious disease and can be instrumental in defining the broad realm of possible interactions and hypotheses (Kilpatrick et al. 2006a\n, Xiao et al. 2007, Peterson and Williams 2008).",

When that understanding is limited and mechanistic data are sparse, such as is often the case with EIDs, efficient data\u2013model integration to support inference and forecasting is crucial. Methods for assimilating data with models of infectious disease are dominated by likelihood approaches. Likelihood based approaches quantitatively evaluate data support for specific hypotheses and are important data\u2013model assimilation tools in ecology (Hobbs and Hilborn 2006). Bayesian methods are increasingly applied; especially when ecological complexity is high and forecasting is a primary goal (Clark 2005). Hierarchical modeling (using either Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods) is gaining prominence across ecological disciplines (Clark and Gelfand 2006, Gelman and Hill 2007, Cressie et al. 2009).",

            "text": "A hierarchical (sometimes referred to as multilevel) model structure defines how information is shared across sampling units and processes. Although it is not yet widely used in disease ecology, this approach is particularly attractive because it allows researchers to accommodate important differences (e.g., among groups, individuals, or regions) while still allowing for shared characteristics ( Clark et al. 2005, Cressie et al. 2009, Qian et al. 2010). Additionally, when the hierarchical structure is built around a conditional modeling framework (i.e., Bayesian or likelihood based) then multiple datasets and processes can be combined in a common analysis (LaDeau and Clark 2006, Clark et al. 2007). State\u2010space models, which may also be hierarchically structured, are becoming standard for portraying population dynamics (Tavecchia et al. 2009, Wang 2009), but they have not been widely applied in modeling infectious diseases (Baadsgaard et al. 2004, He et al. 2010). The state\u2010space approach to modeling populations can be described as the nesting of two models; an observation equation that relates the observed data to the unobserved but true state of the population, and a process equation that represents understanding of the processes governing the state. The state\u2010space formulation allows for partitioning of uncertainty that arises from our inability to perfectly observe the process (i.e., observation error) and uncertainty that results from the failure of our model to perfectly represent the process (process variance or model misspecification). This is especially important in time series applications where process error propagates over time but observation error does not (Calder et al. 2003). If the model is further structured to allow for individual heterogeneity in disease risk (for example) as well as population risk, then it is also hierarchical. Both state\u2010space and hierarchical approaches to data\u2013model assimilation are potentially important avenues for future advances in understanding the infectious dynamics of zoonotic and vector\u2010born infectious disease.",

Human infections with Lyme disease or West Nile virus result when unusual or extreme events that may occur seasonally or sporadically cause critical thresholds to be surpassed (e.g., contact rates, transmission timing, or vector abundance). Our goal is to identify similar characteristics among these diverse pathogen systems that either have facilitated or limited successful data\u2013model integration for inference or forecasting. Finally, we use these insights to construct a conceptual hierarchical modeling framework for organizing research to advance the understanding of zoonotic and vector\u2010borne pathogens and improve forecasting of human disease risk.",

Assimilation of these data with a modeling framework allowed estimation of epidemiological quantities of interest, in particular, the basic reproductive number, R\n0 (Table 1), and the reproductive number R, the number of infections created by an infected individual in a population containing a mixture of infected and susceptible individuals. The reproductive number is critical to assessing the success of control efforts because it must be <1 to assure that the epidemic is subsiding. Several data\u2013model assimilation techniques were used to estimate R\n0 and R including classical (Lipsitch et al. 2003), hierarchical Bayes (McBryde et al. 2006, Lekone 2008), and maximum likelihood (Riley et al. 2003, Wang and Ruan 2004) methods.

As with any stochastic process, separate realizations of the process, in this case the trajectory of epidemics, differed among locations (Wallinga and Teunis 2004). Some of these differences can be explained by high levels of heterogeneity in transmission, the phenomenon known as \u201csuper spreading,\u201d which emerged as a hallmark of the SARS epidemic (Galvani and May 2005, Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005). Although the average number of infections created by an infected individual was certainly less than 10 (Table 1), a few, rare individuals infected more than 100 (Riley et al. 2003, Galvani and May 2005, Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005, Small et al. 2006). It appears that hospital environments that failed to isolate infected individuals early in the epidemic caused this heterogeneity: rates of infection in un\u2010isolated hospital environments were an order of magnitude higher than in the non\u2010hospital environment (Kuk and Tan 2009). Thus, estimates of infectivity of individuals showed that the three examples of \u201csuper spreading\u201d actually did not have exceptionally high infectiousness; instead, super\u2010spreading events seemed to result from characteristics of the environments where these individuals expressed symptoms (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005, Kuk and Tan 2009).",

Failure to do so causes false precision in parameter estimates and in forecasts. Several alternatives for dealing with these heterogeneities in model\u2013data assimilation have been used in modeling the SARS epidemic. Heterogeneity in transmission may be more accurately captured by increasing the number of states in the model, thereby allowing for differences in transmission parameters for each state. For example Riley et al. (2003) included meta\u2010population structure in their model of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. Splitting the infected class into hospitalized and un\u2010hospitalized states represents another illustration of this approach (Lipsitch et al. 2003, Wang and Ruan 2004). A second approach was to employ more realistic models of host contact to better represent heterogeneities resulting from non\u2010uniform mixing of infected and susceptible individuals (e.g., Meyers et al. 2005, Small et al. 2006, Zhong et al. 2009). Finally, parameters may be defined as temporally varying as the epidemic proceeds, reflecting the heterogeneity in transmission created by public health interventions (Kuk and Tan 2009). All of these alternative approaches require expanding the number of parameters to be estimated, which leads to problems with parameter estimation when data are limited (as they inevitably are early in an epidemic). More importantly, all of these strategies for dealing with heterogeneity require sufficient understanding of transmission to represent the heterogeneity in a coherent way within the structure of the model. Rarely will such understanding exist during disease emergence.",

Rather than trying to explicitly account for these heterogeneities in model structure, we can simply treat them as random effects, admitting that we do not understand their sources (Clark and Bjornstad 2004, Clark et al. 2005).

The predominant vector transmitting dengue to humans is the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a species that lives in close proximity to humans and often breeds in man\u2010made containers. The acute illness manifests as headache, fever, exhaustion, rash, and muscle and joint pains. There are four serotypes of dengue viruses and infection with heterologous serotypes in fairly close temporal proximity may produce more severe disease (dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). Although dengue has been endemic in Asia since at least since the 18th century, expansion of the mosquito vectors and global movement of human populations have greatly changed the distribution and intensity of dengue fever, which is now considered an emergent or reemerging disease across Africa, Australia, and the Americas (Gubler 1998).

For example, climatic conditions are important predictors of dengue amplification due to the tight relationship between mosquito life cycles and temperature and precipitation. Mosquito development from egg to biting adult, survival rate at each life stage, and feeding behavior are all strongly dependent on temperature (Watts et al. 1987, Rueda et al. 1990, Focks et al. 1993). Furthermore, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of viral replication within the mosquito depends nonlinearly on temperature and is maximal at temperatures above 34\u00b0C, while the virus fails to be transmitted at temperatures below 30\u00b0C (Watts et al. 1987) in the laboratory. Due to the intimate connection between mosquito population dynamics, viral amplification, and climatic variables, much effort has been invested in developing methods to integrate climate data with observations of mosquitoes and dengue incidence. However, while climate data are often available and prolific at broad spatial scales, mosquito data are less abundant and are rarely characterized at the scale of climate data. Local and transient weather patterns and interactions with land cover are likely to control real\u2010time mosquito abundances and can be difficult to ascertain from the available climate data. A formal framework for accommodating mismatches in scale in order to coherently integrate process models, historical disease incidence data, experimental results, and diverse environmental data would greatly advance understanding of the ecological characteristics that control dengue outbreaks, as well as many other vector\u2010borne diseases.",

Borrelia can persist in several wildlife (zoonotic) hosts and amplify whenever conditions allow. Data and understanding of tick biology and the ecological interactions between ticks and their zoonotic hosts are critical to the study of human Lyme disease risk. Humans are not the predominant host in the Lyme disease system (see Fig. 1c). Humans cannot infect each other or infect ticks. In eastern and central North America, the sole vector of Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick, I. scapularis. Ixodes scapularis ticks feed on vertebrate hosts three times, once each as a larva, nymph, and adult. Larval and nymphal ticks are extreme host generalists that will feed readily from dozens of potential zoonotic host species (Keirans et al. 1996, LoGiudice et al. 2003). Ticks that feed from an infected host might acquire an infection, which can persist and be transmitted during the nymphal (if infected as larvae) and adult blood meals. The life cycle of the blacklegged tick typically lasts for two years and includes three blood meals that are often taken from three different host species.",

The component model for tick population dynamics (Ogden et al. 2005) included 48 different parameters for tick vital rates and two for host availability (white\u2010footed mice and white\u2010tailed deer), and was able to characterize locally observed population fluctuations of larval, nymphal, and adult ticks reasonably well. However, the resultant inference derived from even this complex, ecologically thoughtful model relied heavily on key assumptions. For example, tick population dynamics were most sensitive to mortality rates of immatures (larvae and nymphs), which were assumed to be time\u2010invariant constants. Because of this assumption, warmer conditions that accelerate development automatically resulted in higher densities simply because ticks spent less time subject to constant daily probability of mortality (Ogden et al. 2005). These models thus predict northward expansion of blacklegged ticks into Canada as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. However, they are unable to accommodate nonlinear or spatially heterogeneous relationships between climatic conditions and tick demography. For instance, a warmer winter climate could plausibly promote tick survival and population growth in northern latitudes while simultaneously reducing survival and population growth in southern latitudes. As seen in both the previous case study examples, heterogeneity in transmission rates in both space and time is a fundamental determinant of pathogen amplification and transmission that is often overlooked in even the most mechanistically complex modeling approaches.",

Many of these models can capture current tick distribution with high sensitivity and specificity and are often used to predict the spread of Lyme disease risk into all abiotically suitable tick habitats that occur outside the current range. For a pathogen that is in the process of expanding in range (as is Borrelia), the abiotic conditions that match its current range might represent only a small subset of those that permit its existence. When this is true, any given snapshot of these conditions will be highly conservative in predicting the future range. Phenomenological models often fail to meaningfully address biological mechanisms that might affect tick populations and Lyme disease risk. The abiotic variables that enter models are selected not from a priori expectations but from the set of available data that can be produced from remote sensors. Even when high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved, the predictor variables are often biologically uninterpretable and not necessarily sufficient for accurate forecasting. A complex, fourth\u2010order polynomial with minimum winter temperature was found to be the best predictor of habitat suitability for blacklegged ticks in Brownstein et al. (2003).

There now exists a large library of related experiments and field observation studies that together generate strong inference (e.g., Plowright et al. 2008) regarding the complex ecological interactions that lead to spatiotemporal variability in Lyme disease (e.g., Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001, Schauber et al. 2005, Ostfeld et al. 2006). Synthesis of data sources from a broad group of researchers has shown that the timing and composition of host community dynamics are critical components of Lyme disease amplification and are best understood within the hosts' broader trophic interactions (Fig. 2). The diverse expertise and field data required to define and understand the relationships in Fig. 2 are clearly only possible through collaborative efforts and careful data\u2013model assimilation. White\u2010footed mice are the most competent reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi and also the host on which the tick vector is most likely to survive while attempting a blood meal (Keesing et al., 2009). Consequently, high abundance of white\u2010footed mice in midsummer when larval ticks are most active results in ample opportunities for blood meals that are likely to both infect larval ticks and promote survival to the nymphal stage. The population density of nymphs and infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi are correlated with population density of white\u2010footed mice in the previous summer (Ostfeld et al. 2001, 2006). Summer population density of white\u2010footed mice, in turn, is determined largely by acorn production (genus Quercus) the prior autumn (Elkinton et al. 1996, Ostfeld et al. 1996, Jones et al. 1998). Mouse populations with access to abundant seed resources have high overwinter survival rates, begin breeding earlier in the spring, and reach higher densities at the time ticks are seeking hosts (Wolff 1996, Ostfeld et al. 2006). Because of the strong trophic links between acorns and mice and between mice and both ticks and Borrelia, acorn production provides a valuable leading indicator of incidence of Lyme disease in humans two summers later (Schauber et al. 2005). Because acorn production by populations of oaks can be synchronized over areas of hundreds to thousands of square kilometers (Liebhold et al. 2004), the predictive power of acorn production at any one site might be high even hundreds of kilometers away (Schauber et al. 2005).",

This system also illustrates that data are still needed to better understand host and vector abundances and demographic processes, at both fine and broad spatial scales.

That it persists from year to year in many locations confirms its continuous presence in either host or vector species throughout the year. Although there are numerous hypotheses regarding what extrinsic (e.g., weather, habitat) and intrinsic (e.g., host\u2013vector population dynamics) factors might drive spatiotemporal heterogeneity in WNV persistence, amplification and disease outbreaks (e.g., Kilpatrick et al. 2006b\n, \nc\n, Day and Shaman 2008, Platonov et al. 2008, LaDeau et al. 2010), the ability to capture the processes that determine annual and spatial intensity of WNV amplification and forecast disease outbreaks remains elusive. There is a growing library of research detailing the individual components of the WNV disease system: varying competence (ability to become infected and transmit infection) among mosquito vector species (Kilpatrick et al. 2005, Turell et al. 2005, Reisen et al. 2006b\n) and avian host species (Komar et al. 2003), strain\u2010specific relationships between temperature and viral replication rates within mosquitoes (Reisen et al. 2006a\n, Kilpatrick et al. 2008), vector feeding preference (Andreadis et al. 2004, Kilpatrick et al. 2006b\n, c), host immunity (Fang and Reisen 2006), spatial heterogeneity in host seroprevalence (Komar et al. 2005, Bradley et al. 2008), and spatiotemporal records of human incidence (see footnote 6). The next crucial step is to develop a coherent framework to integrate these distinct components into a common model of the WNV system.",

For example, mosquito density (Tachiiri et al. 2006) and early\u2010season vector infection rates (Brownstein et al. 2004) both seem to indicate increased human risk of WNV infection in late summer. Evidence of WNV infections in avian communities in early and midsummer are also potential predictors of local spillover of WNV into human populations (Eidson et al. 2001, Guptill et al. 2003, Nielsen and Reisen 2007). As in the earlier case studies, the assumption that vector density is positively associated with human disease risk is widely accepted. Thus, when the early\u2010warning signals mentioned above indicate that WNV amplification is occurring, mosquito control programs are most often enacted to reduce local mosquito abundances (e.g., Carney et al. 2008, Lothrop et al. 2008). Experimentation to test the efficacy of these early\u2010warning signals or the importance of the biological processes they represent could potentially leave humans at risk and is not ethically feasible. As is the case with most infectious disease research, more creative methods are needed to synthesize the available data with alternative process models to evaluate mechanistic assumptions that characterize disease transmission and define how human risk is minimized.",

Wonham and colleagues (2006) reviewed several published compartmental models of WNV transmission, all of which used a slightly different structure of differential equations to represent transitions between susceptible and infected hosts and susceptible and infected vectors. The authors found that each model was highly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the relationship between transmission rate and abundances of hosts and vectors (i.e., density dependent, frequency dependent, constant) and that allowing animal hosts to transition from infected to immune (versus to susceptible or dead) dramatically changed the predicted R\n0 for the disease (Wonham et al. 2006). Unfortunately, data on host recovery and immunity is rare (but see Komar et al. 2003, Fang and Reisen 2006, Nemeth et al. 2008) and potential heterogeneities among recovery rates for species and regions need to be obtained before reliable predictions of R\n0 can be made. Jiang et al. (2009) also used the WNV system to demonstrate that parameter estimates (e.g., of R\n0) from standard dynamic compartmental models are also sensitive to starting conditions (i.e., the initial numbers of infected birds or mosquitoes).",

This case study again underlines that even complex models are only as good as the assumptions.

Each data type can contribute toward understanding and predicting the latent parameters critical to disease dynamics, but each is also subject to potentially large measurement error. One of the major advantages to using a conditional hierarchical modeling approach is the ability to flexibly accommodate such data types and their different sources of measurement error by explicitly characterizing the relationship between each type of data and the latent parameters they inform (dashed arrows in Fig. 3). Examples of such data models include likelihood\u2010based mark\u2013recapture models, which have been extended to incorporate among\u2010individual and spatial and temporal variation (Royle and Link 2002, Royle 2009), and error rate models for infection assays (Joseph et al. 1995). Incidence data on human disease are also subject to error (e.g., He et al. 2010). Lyme disease reports, for example, may be low in areas with recent disease emergence and rise as physician awareness increases (Young 1998, Chen et al. 2006). The framework in Fig. 3 allows for such biases to be systematically dealt with; observed disease can be related to true incidence through a data model with a spatially and temporally varying latent parameter to characterize the probability that a case is reported given that it actually occurred. Furthermore, these probability parameters could be regressed on factors ide.gified as important in previous studies, such as time since first disease report in the county, distance from a hospital, and human population density, potentially allowing us to also learn about the sources of reporting error and bias.",

However, a key difference is that the process models in Fig. 3 are both formally fused with data and structured to allow for parameter stochasticity. For example, in a vector\u2010borne disease system we could use a susceptible\u2010infected (SI) model to characterize pathogen movement through susceptible uninfected and infected vectors, and relate the infection process to surveys of vector abundance and infection. The SI model would include a stochastic and potentially spatially and temporally varying transmission parameter, and be implemented as a state\u2010space model in which populations of susceptible and infected vectors are related through data error models to the raw survey data. A more detailed model could then add population structure and could also include an analogous model for primary reservoir hosts. When these process models capture key dynamics of the disease's epidemiology, they will allow us to explore thresholds for disease persistence in a population and test how close to such thresholds real populations tend to be. In Lyme disease, for example, rate of infection of the tick vector appears to be correlated well with local tick abundance (Chen et al. 2006). This makes sense mechanistically: in a standard SI model, higher tick abundance means more bites per host, (assuming constant host density), which increases the proportion of infected hosts because each host is \u201csampling\u201d multiple ticks and has a greater chance of encountering an infected one. Higher host infection rates will feed back to increase the rates of infection in ticks, because there will be a higher probability that each tick's blood meal comes from an infected host (Caraco et al. 2002). So the proportion of infected ticks and tick abundance are dynamically related both directly and through feedbacks, and their nonlinear covariation will inform the process model for infection dynamics to provide inference about the critical latent variables of transmission and amplification rates. As with current dynamic compartment models, the precision and accuracy of the parameters will be directly related to the biological assumptions that structure the model and to the data used to construct the model. However, the structure of this framework will allow us to evaluate data and process structure explicitly through the partitioned process and observation error terms.",

This disease intensity surface can be then related to hypothesized causal factors such as density and infection rates of vectors, and with environmental factors, including climate and land use, as well as population and behavior data, including contact networks (Farnsworth et al. 2006).
