Of the 37 episodes of sinusitis, 6 did not have a second nasal wash on the tenth day of illness, leaving 31 of the 37 sinusitis events available for analysis. There were 18 cases of sinusitis diagnosed based on persistent symptoms and 13 based on worsening symptoms (Table 2). Compared to the results of their Day 3 sample, 78% of children with persistent symptoms and 62% of children with worsening symptoms had a Day 10 nasal sample that was negative for a virus or had the same virus as at Day 3. A new virus was detected in 22% of children with persistent and 38% with worsening symptoms, respectively. When taken together, a new virus was detected in the Day 10 nasal sample in 29% of all 31 episodes. There was no difference in the type of respiratory viruses between children with worsening vs persistent symptoms. On Day 10, 55% of subjects with sinusitis had a virus detected in their nasal wash samples. This compares to 31% of recovery nasal washes taken within the same time frame from children with uncomplicated URIs and 34% taken during surveillance visits (P < .01; Table 3). When nasal wash samples from subjects with sinusitis were compared with those obtained at surveillance visits, the new viruses detected on Day 10 were more likely to be adenovirus, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus and were less likely to be rhinovirus. In comparison, those sinusitis subjects with the same virus detected on Day 10 as on Day 3 showed a similar virus distribution as observed at surveillance visits (Table 4).",

This decrease may reflect our efforts in the last 24 months of the study to enhance our reporting of URIs. As we have now demonstrated that the rate of sinusitis is related to the severity of the initial URI, increased reporting of milder URIs would be expected to result in a decreased rate of complications. In this study, RSV was detected more frequently at URI events that became complicated by sinusitis, compared to uncomplicated URI visits, suggesting a more prominent pathogenic role for this virus. Although no other studies correlating sinusitis with virology have been reported, similar studies have been done for acute otitis media. Chonmaitree et al [13] followed 362 infants from birth to 12 months of age and performed viral PCRs on nasopharyngeal swabs. The development of acute otitis media was associated with increasing age and with infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, or bocavirus. Although we did not find an association with the other viruses, it is pertinent that RSV was associated with complications in both studies. RSV is known to elicit a robust immune response in the nose and lower respiratory tract [14]. It is probable that this virus produces more local inflammation in the nasal mucosa, thereby affecting the sinus ostia.",

An important problem related to the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis is that persistent or worsening upper respiratory symptoms may result from the development of a classic, secondary bacterial infection or a second viral infection that is closely spaced to the first. We found that, when using the criteria of persistent or worsening symptoms, 71% of patients had the same or no virus detected on the 10-day nasal sample, supporting the diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis in these patients. However, nearly 30% had a new virus identified, suggesting that sequential viral infections may explain the symptoms. This observation is supported by data from several clinical trials, demonstrating that about one-third of children clinically diagnosed to have sinusitis lack evidence of a bacterial infection [7, 15, 16]. In addition, in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of placebo vs amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in children with clinically diagnosed sinusitis, the non-response rate to the antibacterial was 36%, while the spontaneous cure rate in recipients of the placebo was 32%; each of these correspond closely to the percentage of patients in our study who had sequential viral infections [7]. This is also close to the number of children (20%) who have normal radiographs despite meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute sinusitis [17].",

Furthermore, the identification of a new virus does not preclude the possibility of a dual infection caused by both a virus and bacteria. However, the compelling data show that when a new virus was detected in subjects with sinusitis on Day 10, it was statistically more likely to be adenovirus, influenza, or RSV (rather than rhinovirus), as compared to the viruses identified during surveillance. Furthermore, a virus was identified in 55% of the 31 patients with sinusitis on Day 10, a frequency of detection significantly different than the identification of viruses during surveillance or recovery.",

We found no significant differences in either the bacterial presence or density. Of note, the absence of M. catarrhalis was associated with the acquisition of a new virus. In contrast, Xu et al [18] showed higher rates of colonization with bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx in otitis media\u2013prone children, compared with those with uncomplicated URIs.

However, this is the peak age group for children with acute sinusitis and avoids infants and toddlers, who experience a much higher rate of acute otitis media. Children with acute otitis media are likely to receive antibiotics earlier in a URI, which could blunt the appearance of sinusitis. Samples were obtained using nasal washes, which may not represent the microbial conditions in the nasopharynx but are more tolerable in longitudinal studies than repeated nasopharyngeal swabs [20]. Our rate of detection of viruses is similar to other studies, suggesting that\u2014at least for viruses\u2014this method was reliable [8, 21\u201323].
