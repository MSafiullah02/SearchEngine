Triterpenoid saponins have useful pharmacological roles, including antimicrobial, antiviral, anti\u2010pathogen and anti\u2010cancer activities (Maes et al., 2004; Chan, 2007; Tang et al., 2015). In addition, triterpenoid saponins have been widely used in beverages, confectioneries and cosmetics (Uematsu et al., 2000; Sparg et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2008; Benchaar & Chouinard, 2009).",

Clinically, glycyrrhizin has been widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis in Asian countries (van Rossum et al., 1998; Shibata, 2000). Sales of magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate injection reached CNY \u00a51.6 billion in China in 2014. Glycyrrhizin is also commercially available world\u2010wide as a sweetener, as its sweetness is 150 times greater than that of sucrose (Kitagawa, 2002; Seki et al., 2011). The annual value of global trade in liquorice root from Glycyrrhiza plants was estimated at more than US $42.1 million in 2007 (Hayashi & Sudo, 2009; Kojoma et al., 2010). Therefore, the market demand for glycyrrhizin has increased (Seki et al., 2008, 2011). Currently, most of the key genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin have been successfully cloned and characterized, including \u03b2\u2010amyrin synthetase (bAS) (Shen et al., 2009), cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 88D6 (CYP88D6) (Seki et al., 2008) and CYP72A154 (Seki et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). UDP\u2010dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) have crucial roles in the last glucuronosylation reaction, which may greatly improve the sweetness and solubility of glycyrrhetinic acid.",

UGATs can greatly change the bioactivity, solubility or stability of metabolites (Kren & Martinkova, 2001), thereby playing important roles in plant growth, plant development and enzyme\u2010dependent modification of metabolites in metabolic engineering applications (Loos & Steinkellner, 2014; De Bruyn et al., 2015). In general, it is difficult to characterize the UGTs of natural products because natural product UGT families always have a wide variety of members with various functions in plants (Yonekura\u2010Sakakibara & Hanada, 2011). For instance, there are 115 UGTs in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and 242 UGTs in the Glycine max genome (Yonekura\u2010Sakakibara & Hanada, 2011). In Panax ginseng, 512 contigs potentially encoding plant UGTs have been identified in expressed sequence tag (EST) data sets available from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank (Yan et al., 2014). However, only 13 triterpenoid UGTs have been characterized in plants (Supporting Information Table S1) (Seki et al., 2015). UGATs involved in the final catalytic steps of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis have been investigated ever since two key cytochrome P450 monooxygenases were cloned to produce glycyrrhetinic acid in 2011 (Seki et al., 2011). However, the key UGATs remain unknown (Fig. 1).",

Here, we systematically screened 434 putative UGATs from Glycyrrhiza uralensis using deep transcriptome sequencing. Unexpectedly, we found one unique GuUGAT (c55437_g1) that was able to catalyse continuous two\u2010step glucuronosylation of glycyrrhetinic acid to directly yield glycyrrhizin; thus, the complete pathway of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis was determined. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a GuUGAT capable of catalysing a continuous two\u2010step glucuronosylation reaction; thus, this GuUGAT is unique among known glycosyltransferases of bioactive plant natural products. Knowledge regarding this gene may contribute to our understanding of traditional glycosyltransferases, pave the way for the complete biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin and be useful in the modification of natural products through genetic and metabolic engineering.",

Glycyrrhiza uralensis roots accumulate high concentrations of glycyrrhizin after exposure to suitable drought or salt stress (Pan et al., 2006; Nasrollahi et al., 2014), suggesting that the genes that are associated with glycyrrhizin biosynthesis may be induced when plants are stressed by drought or salt. An assessment of plants under these conditions may allow us to uncover the specific UGATs that are involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. In our study, we subjected 21\u2010d\u2010old G. uralensis plants to suitable drought and salt stress conditions and chose GU_root1 (roots of plants that were treated with high salt), GU_root2 (roots of plants that were exposed to drought) and GU_root3 (control roots) for deep transcriptome sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (Fig. S1). Empty reads, low\u2010quality reads and reads containing unknown bases were removed from the raw reads. The resulting clean reads were further assembled to identify high\u2010quality transcripts. In total, 12.25 G clean bases of GU_root1 (GenBank accession no. SRS1141032), 10.6 G clean bases of GU_root2 (GenBank accession no. SRS1141168) and 10.14 G clean bases of GU_root3 (GenBank accession no. SRS1141169) were examined (Table S3). A total of 152 246 transcripts were assembled with a mean length of 891 bp and an N50 of 1640 bp (Tables S3\u2013S5). Compared with previously assembled G. uralensis transcriptome sequencing data (Ramilowski et al., 2013), the amount of sequencing data produced in this work was approximately five\u2010fold greater in each sample (Table S6) (Ramilowski et al., 2013).

Nevertheless, the number of putative UGTs identified in this study was so large that it became difficult to identify UGATs involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Differential expression (DE) analysis and coexpression (CE) analysis are powerful tools to characterize functional genes in the transcriptome data of plants because enzymes that are involved in the same function are believed to be temporally and spatially induced and coexpressed in some cases (Jorgensen et al., 2005; Naoumkina et al., 2010). To further identify putative UGTs, they were first filtered by DE analysis (Figs S6\u2013S8, 2a). Then, the resulting UGTs that were coupled with other DE unigenes (Notes S2, S3) were interrogated by hierarchical cluster analysis based on Pearson correlation (Figs S9, 2b,c). Putative UGTs that were up\u2010regulated under salt or drought stress or that were coexpressed with the bAS, CYP88D6 and CYP72A154 genes, which are involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway, were regarded as important candidates (Fig. S10). In this work, to avoid false\u2010positive and false\u2010negative errors, the samples were sequenced deeply with a high coverage of transcripts, precisely reflecting the expression levels of unigenes. Moreover, to fully screen the possible UGATs, putative UGTs that had high similarity with known plant triterpenoid UGTs were also considered key candidates (Fig. S11). In total, eight UGTs (Notes S4; Figs S10, S11) were screened as candidate UGATs for the subsequent in vitro catalytic experiments.",

GuUGAT was then purified using a protein purification kit (Fig. 3a), verified by protein sequencing (Fig. S12) and used in an in vitro catalytic reaction (Fig. 3b). Catalytic products were determined by high\u2010resolution HPLC\u2010ESI\u2010LTQ\u2010Orbitrap MS. To our surprise, compared with the control, the catalytic reaction containing the unique GuUGAT produced a new peak when glycyrrhetinic acid or glucopyranosiduronic acid was used as a substrate. The new peak was further identified as glycyrrhizin (Fig. 3d,e) by comparing the retention time of 4.48 min, accurate molecular ion at m/z 821.39865, and characteristic fragment ions (m/z 645.45285, m/z 469.34904 and m/z 351.03306) with an authentic reference (Fig. 3c). Analysis of the MS fragmentation pathway further verified its chemical structure (Fig. S13). Other UDP sugars, such as UDP\u2010glucose and UDP\u2010galactose, were also evaluated for comparison, indicating that GuUGAT is generally specific for the sugar moiety of UDP\u2010GlcA (Fig. S14). Interestingly, almost no glucopyranosiduronic acid or other byproducts were detected in the catalytic reaction of GuUGAT (Fig. 3d).

Tissue expression analysis revealed that GuUGAT was generally expressed in the leaves, stems and roots and highly expressed in the roots under NaCl or drought stress (Fig. S15). To further demonstrate the key role of GuUGAT in the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin, we analysed the change in the expression level of GuUGAT under drought and salt stress. Fig. 2 shows that GuUGAT was up\u2010regulated significantly under salt stress in particular and coexpressed with key genes involved in the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin, including farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS), bAS and CYP88D6 (Notes S3).

Moreover, the real\u2010time qPCR of GuUGAT in vivo revealed that the expression profiles of GuUGAT and bAS are very similar across different conditions (Fig. 4).

            "text": "Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of bioactive natural plant products is crucial for the future genetic and metabolic engineering of plants. The biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin involves > 20 enzymes. The upstream biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, similar to that of other triterpenoid saponins, includes mevalonate (MVA) and plastid\u2010localized 2\u2010C\u2010methyl\u2010d\u2010erythritol 4\u2010phosphate (MEP) pathways, which provide important isopentenyl diphosphates (IPPs). Then, IPPs and dimethylallyl diphosphates (DMAPPs) are catalysed by FPS, squalene synthase (SQS), squalene monooxygenase or epoxidase (SQE) and bAS to yield \u03b2\u2010amyrin. Various P450s and UGTs are involved in the downstream biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin (Fig. 1). To elucidate the downstream biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, Seki et al. successfully cloned beta\u2010amyrin 11\u2010oxidase (CYP88D6) in 2008 and demonstrated that it is the cytochrome P450 involved in the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin (Seki et al., 2008). More recently, CYP72A154, another cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was also found to be capable of producing glycyrrhetinic acid (Seki et al., 2011). UGATs are crucial UGTs for the completion of the last glucuronosylation reaction, which may greatly improve the sweetness and solubility of glycyrrhetinic acid. Mining of UGATs that are involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis has been performed ever since cytochrome P450 monooxygenases were cloned in 2011 (Seki et al., 2011); however, these UGATs still remain unknown. Here, we systematically screened candidate UGTs from 434 putative UGTs through deep transcriptome sequencing, and we successfully identified one unique GuUGAT that catalyses the glucuronosylation of the C\u20103 hydroxyl group of glycyrrhetinic acid, thus uncovering the complete pathway of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, this UGAT produced glycyrrhizin directly via two\u2010step continuous glucuronosylation (Fig. 3). In fact, glycosylation of bioactive triterpenoids and other natural plant products was generally believed to occur through the addition of only one sugar moiety by specialized UGTs (Thimmappa et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2015; Seki et al., 2015), although this was not the case for a few UGTs of Streptomyces species (Luzhetskyy et al., 2005; Li et al., 2013b). The GuUGAT that we identified in this study can catalyse two\u2010step glucuronosylation reactions continuously and is therefore a novel UGT of bioactive natural plant products. Furthermore, previously reported plant triterpenoid UGTs can only use four UDP sugars as glycosyl donors, namely UDP\u2010galactose, UDP\u2010glucose, UDP\u2010rhamnose and UDP\u2010xylose; however, the glycosyl donor used by UDP\u2010glucuronic acid (GlcA) remains unclear (Table S1) (Seki et al., 2015). GuUGAT is also the first plant triterpenoid UGT that can use UDP\u2010GlcA as a glycosyl donor. Phylogenetic analysis of characterized UGTs also indicated that GuUGAT is in a new subclade in the plant UGT73 family (Fig. 5), further demonstrating the novelty of GuUGAT in the plant UGT73 family. The discovery of GuUGAT in this work helps to elucidate the complete pathway of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis, providing new insight into the function of glycosyltransferases. Additionally, GuUGAT may be useful for the modification of important natural products.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin, the catalytic product of GuUGAT, is an important bioactive natural product with high economic value. This compound is mainly derived from the belowground portion of the Glycyrrhiza plant. Glycyrrhizin is an important low\u2010calorie sweetener that is available world\u2010wide and is usually used as a flavouring agent in food, beverages and confectioneries; its sweetness is c. 150 times greater than that of sucrose (Kitagawa, 2002; Seki et al., 2011). Glycyrrhizin also has useful pharmacological roles, including anti\u2010cancer, antivirus and anti\u2010inflammation activities (Baba & Shigeta, 1987; Ito et al., 1987, 1988; Cinatl et al., 2003; Fiore et al., 2008; Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009). Glycyrrhizin preparations for clinical treatment of chronic hepatitis have been widely used in Asian countries, and sales of these preparations have reached approximately CNY \u00a52 billion yr\u22121 (van Rossum et al., 1998; Shibata, 2000). In addition, glycyrrhizin is now being used as a cosmetic ingredient as a consequence of its beneficial effect on skin (Hayashi & Sudo, 2009). Consequently, the market demand for glycyrrhizin has increased in recent years as a result of its useful properties (Hayashi & Sudo, 2009). Nevertheless, the acquisition of glycyrrhizin depends wholly on artificial extraction from roots of Glycyrrhiza plants, especially from wild G. uralensis, which greatly accelerates the consumption of natural resources and may damage the ecosystem. The complete biosynthesis of important natural products using synthetic biological techniques has been carried out in recent years, with the goals of generating new chemicals, improving human health, and addressing environmental issues (Way et al., 2014; Galanie et al., 2015; Winzer et al., 2015). GuUGAT, which can catalyse the formation of glycyrrhizin via glycyrrhetinic acid with few by\u2010products, may be suitable for genetic modification, thereby allowing the complete biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin and its synthesis using synthetic biology. GuUGAT and similar genes are likely to have important roles in future industrial applications involving genetic and metabolic engineering.",
