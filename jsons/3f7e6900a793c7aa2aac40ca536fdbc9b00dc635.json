Maxillofacial surgery represents an example of a specialty that has had to adapt to this outbreak, because of the subspecialties of oncology and traumatology. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of this outbreak on the specialty of maxillofacial surgery and how the current situation is being manag Q9 ed on a worldwide scale. To achieve this goal, the authors developed an anonymous questionnaire which was posted on the internet and also sent to maxillofacial surgeons around the globe using membership lists from various subspecialty associations. The questionnaire asked for information about the COVID-19 situation in the respondent's country and in their workplace, and what changes they were facing in their practices in light of the outbreak. The objective was not only to collect and analyse data, but also to highlight what the specialty is facing and how it is handling the situation, in the hope that this information will be useful as a reference in the future, not only for this specialty, but also for others, should COVID-19 or a simi Q10 lar global threat arise again.",

Nevertheless, dental surgery remained one of the three most active subspecialties together with traumatol Q21 ogy (OAI = 83.9%) and head and neck tumour surgery (OAI = 66.7%). The greatest reduction in activity occurred in both orthognathic surgery (OA Q22 I = 8.8%) and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery (OA Q23 I = 7.0%). The OAIs for the other subspecialties were 11.1% for craniofacial surgery, 14.9% for paediatric surg Q24 ery, and 26.5% for oral surgery.",
