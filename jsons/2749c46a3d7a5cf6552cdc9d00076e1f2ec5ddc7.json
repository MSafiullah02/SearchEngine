Following the declaration of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30th, 2020, it has become imperative to develop diagnostic tools to reliably detect the virus in infected patients. Several methods based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been developed. In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since all these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low and middle income countries. In the interest of economy, time and availability of chemicals and consumables, the SYBR Green-based detection was implemented to establish a convenient assay. Therefore, we adapted one of WHO recommended Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green. Our results suggest that SYBR-Green detection represents a reliable cost-effective alternative to increase the testing capacity.",

            "text": "Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a molecular technique widely used when detection and/or quantification of a specific DNA target is needed. qPCR is based on fluorescence to measure the amount of a DNA target present at each cycle of amplification during the PCR. The most common ways of generating a fluorescent signal are by use of specific hydrolysis probes (i.e. TaqMan\u00ae probes), or a double-stranded DNA binding dye (i.e SYBR\u00ae Green). SYBR-Green-based detection method presents several advantages over Taqman chemistry ones, as being cheaper and not requiring the synthesis of specific probes. This technique has already been proposed and used for laboratory testing of different pathogens, including viruses (Espy et al. 2006; Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006; Gomes-Ruiz et al. 2006; Kumar et al. 2012 ), bacteria (Kositanont et al. 2007; Keerthirathne et al. 2016 ) and unicellular protozoan parasites (Espy et al. 2006; Haanshuus et al. 2019 ), among others. For SARS-CoV-2 detection, some preliminary reports have attempted to assess the sensitivity and predictive value of the different sets of primers and probes available (either commercially or in-house developed) (Barra et al. 2020; Casto et al. 2020; Jung et al. 2020 ), but so far, no comparison has been made between the different real time chemistries for this emerging virus.",

Here we showed that Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocol recommended by the WHO Poon et al. 2020) can be successfully adapted and alternatively used with SYBR Green-based two-step qPCR.. Besides, performing a comparison of the different molecular techniques by employing dilutions of control vectors and RNA standards for quantification, we tested our assay with 8 clinical samples collected from confirmed COVID-19 cases and one negative patient.

Concentrations used were lowered to avoid non-specific amplification (data not shown). Briefly, a 20\u03bcL monoplex reaction contained 5\u03bcL of 4x TaqMan Fast Virus Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), 0.6\u00b5L of each primer (0.3\u03bcM final concentration each), 0.2\u03bcL of the probe (0.1\u03bcM final concentration) and 4\u03bcL of RNA. These monoplexes were performed for both N and ORF1b-nsp14 regions. Thermal cycling was run on a Step-One Plus RT-PCR thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycle parameters: 50\u00b0C for 5min for reverse transcription, inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 95\u00b0C for 20s and then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5s and 60\u00b0C for 30s. The expected amplicon sizes of ORF1b-nsp14 and N are 132bp and 110bp, respectively. This protocol was carried out with serial dilutions of plasmids containing N and ORF1b-nsp14 genes (kindly provided by Dr. Leo Poon from the School of Public Health, University of Hong Kong), RNA standards of the same targets constructed in our laboratory, and later validated with RNA samples of COVID-19 cases. A non-template control (nuclease-free water) was included in every one-step RT-qPCR run. We manually set the threshold value to 0.015 in all assays to determine the threshold cycle (Ct). A test run for the amplification of the controls was done to select the appropriate dilution to use for the amplification of the clinical samples, which were, in turn, run in duplicates.",

To do so, the salt and magnesium concentration were set at 50 mM and 1.5 mM, respectively, as it is indicated by the manufacturer. Initial DNA copy numbers were obtained using the Ct values empirically observed in the SYBR Green qPCR for the positive control and the clinical samples for both targets (showed in Table 2 ). Then, we interpolated them in their corresponding standard curve in order to estimate the initial number of copies in the qPCR reaction. After this, we calculated the number of target copy numbers after one PCR cycle and estimated the DNA concentration for each sequence expressed as nM using the DNA/RNA Copy Number Calculator from the http://www.endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php website.",

This was verified by melting curve analysis in every case, in agreement with the positive control ( Fig. 3B and Table 2 ). In addition, sample 2, which was suspected to have a low viral load, was correctly amplified with this protocol. As for the negative viral RNA sample (sample 8), even though it seems to amplify in very late cycles ( Fig. 3A and Table 2 ), the melting curve analysis reveals that the amplification corresponds to primer dimers and/or non-specific products ( Fig. 3B and Table 2 ).",

Given the results previously described, we hypothesized that the difference between the Tm of the positive control and the clinical samples assayed here was due to a higher GC content in the N target from Uruguayan patients. To test this, we first cloned 5 of 7 PCR product obtained from the clinical samples and sequenced one molecular clone for each ( Figure 4) . The results showed that all sequences were identical between them and a BLAST search showed that all cloned sequences had 100% identity with SARS-CoV-2, confirming that SYBR-Green based qPCR specific amplified viral RNA present in the clinical samples. We then calculated the GC content as well as the Tm was in silico estimated for the amplicon sequences of the N target from clinical samples. Comparisons were made taking as reference the the N target of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain, which was used as positive control (Table 3) . Given the in silico Tm estimates, the N amplicons obtained for SARS-CoV-2 samples should have a higher Tm (around 2\u00b0C) than that of SARS-CoV Urbani strain, which confirms that the Tm differences observed for N amplicon derive from their different GC content. The magnitude of the Tm gain correlated positively with the GC% (Pearson, r = 0.843, P < 0.001). Therefore, we conclude that the observed differences on the Tm of N targets from clinical samples were due to differences in their GC content. ",

Therefore, counting on an alternative detection method such as SYBR Green-based two-step qPCR, that only requires two conserved regions for primer binding instead of three (for hybridization probe), it might become useful.
