            "text": "suggest intravenous and intramuscular ondansetron forms have better 48 efficacy but are not practical in the home setting. The dose of ondansetron is 0.15 49 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 8 mg. The dose may be repeated once, if patient 50 vomits within 10 minutes after the first dose (Figure 1). 51 The approach to managing present FPIES reactions is influenced by the severity of 52 the past reactions, as depicted in Figure 1. The patients and or caregivers might 53 attempt to contact their physician on an urgent basis but access to their physician 54 may be limited during COVID-19 pandemic. 55 Introduction of new foods 56 It is prudent to delay introduction of new high-risk foods until the COVID-19 57 pandemic resolves to minimize the risk of acute FPIES reactions, particularly in 58 patients with moderate-severe FPIES or those with multiple food FPIES. Caregivers 59 should discuss with their physician if food introduction may continue. In case of 60 exclusively breast-fed or formula-fed young infants, when the time window of 61 preferred introduction of solid foods is closing, the introduction should be done in a 62 cautious manner over a longer than usual period of time, eg 5-10 days, starting from 63 a very small amount and doubling this amount with every feeding given twice daily 64 until full serving is reached. The caregivers should be educated to discontinue the 65 introduction if gastrointestinal symptoms appear, such as diarrhea, intermittent 66 vomiting, or increased gastroesophageal reflux. The caregivers should contact their 67 physician to discuss if food introduction may continue. The lowest risk foods such as 4 vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, parsnip) should be chosen for introduction. 69 (1) The goal should be to introduce one or two different foods and serve them in 70 various forms and textures. For patients with mild FPIES or single food FPIES who 71 have already introduced several foods, a careful discussion with caregivers is 72 warranted about their preference regarding new foods, protocol for slow 73 introduction and contingency plan in case of adverse reaction. 74 Evaluation for resolution of FPIES 75 Evaluation for resolution of FPIES by oral food challenge should be deferred until 76 the COVID-19 pandemic resolves to minimize the risk of acute reactions. 77 Atypical FPIES 78 Patients with detectable food-specific IgE antibody via skin prick test or serologic 79 measurement, are referred to as atypical FPIES. The majority of these patients 80 exhibit classic FPIES symptoms during reactions but a small subset might transition 81to immediate symptoms such as hives, skin rashes, or very rarely, anaphylaxis. 82Depending on the physician assessment of the likelihood of an immediate-IgE 83 mediated reaction, emergency medications may be prescribed and management of 84 anaphylaxis discussed proactively (2). 85Managing comorbidities 86Patients with FPIES have high rates of allergic comorbidities, including IgE-87 mediated food allergy to foods other than FPIES triggers, asthma, atopic dermatitis, 88 allergic rhinitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis. (5). It is important to maintain optimal 89 control of these comorbid conditions during the COVID-supply of safe foods, and anxiety about potential reactions, the 94International FPIES Association website (www. fpies.org) provides valuable advice 95 for day-to-day management of FPIES and can be utilized as an important 96 educational resource to complement medical management of FPIES. 97In summary, effective management of FPIES during the COVID-19 pandemic 98 requires modification of the existing treatment paradigm to minimize the need for 99 emergency department intervention and reduce risk of acquiring COVID-19. 100",
