BEFV infection is characterized by variable clinical signs, such as acute febrile reaction, lameness, stiffness, reduced-milk production, lowered-male fertility, and also death in cattle [[1], [2], [3]]. The disease has been reported in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia and Africa. In addition, in recent years there have been several major outbreaks in China and much more widespread, and it has led to significant economic losses to dairy industry [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. Diagnosis and vaccination now are of great importance in the management of BEFV. However, vaccines at presently in use are less than ideal due to the poor heat-stability that might be incapable of providing reliable and durable protection following a single dose [3], and further research is required to develop a rapid diagnostic assay that will provide reliable tools for the prevention and control of BEFV.",

            "text": "Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a proliferation of next-generation molecular diagnostics relative to traditional PCR [27]. It is performed at a low and constant temperature (optimal temperatures 37\u00b0C-42 \u00b0C) with the simple set-up and no thermal or chemical melting of DNA is required. The technology takes advantage of three major proteins including a recombinase enzyme to separate the DNA duplex, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins to stabilize the open complex, and polymerase to begin DNA synthesis using two opposing primers and probe chemistries. Much like PCR, if target sequence is indeed present, an exponential DNA amplification reaction is initiated. It can specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format ranging from trace levels to detectable amounts of product with a rapid turnaround time. Commonly, the RPA amplification products can be detected by gel electrophoresis, probe-based fluorescence monitoring, lateral flow dipsticks depending on the specific oligonucleotide primers and/or a probe. Recently, RPA amplification system combined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [28], aptamer based bio-barcode (ABC) [29], and hybridization in microarray format [30] have emerged. Lateral flow dipsticks detection based systems requires an additional oligonucleotide which is typically labeled on the 5\u2032 end of FAM and conjoined with the opposing amplification primer typically labeled with biotin on the 5\u2032 end. Consequently, this amplicons can be detected in a \u2018sandwich\u2019 assay. Although RPA technology has been widely used for detection of various pathogens since its initial development [[31], [32], [33], [34]], there is no RPA used for BEFV detection, so far.",

Consistent with previous various nucleic acid tests for detection BEFV, the primers were designed for the amplification of G gene among isolates obtained from Mainland China, as well as Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Turkey and Israel, and this method might also be useful for the detection of BEFV strains isolated from other countries and regions [37].",

In this study, several primer and probe combinations were designed and screened for specific amplification efficiency for the RPA assay (Table 1). It is worth mentioning that, design and determine of ideal BEFV primers and probes are much more stringent as it requires longer primers (30\u201335 bases) and probes (46\u201352 bases) leading to the formation of secondary structures. Furthermore, the amplicons of RPA combined with LF Probe system were visualized using both a simple \u2018sandwich\u2019 LFD assay and 2% agarose gel. In this study, we firstly performed primers/probe screening on 2% agarose gel to exclude non-specific amplification (Fig. 1A), and analyzed its amplification efficiency with labeled amplicons on the LFD (Fig. 1B).",

            "text": "The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, specific, simple, and rapid diagnostic assay that is applied to detection of BEFV infections. According to previous published reports, an extensive performance on detecting BEFV was carried out including reliable assay protocol for identification of diseases (RAPID)-bioactive amplification with probing (BAP) assay, RT-LAMP, real time qPCR and conventional RT-PCR [12,23,25,38]. With respect to analytical sensitivity, the limit of detection of the assay was 8 copies per reaction determined by testing replicates of various concentrations of G-T3-RPA plasmid (Fig. 3A). It seems to be similar to other techniques reported previously such as RT-LAMP (20 copies/tube of RNA), real-time-RT-PCR (lies between 10 and 100 copies), and higher than RT-PCR (200 copies/tube of RNA), but lower than that the detection limit of RAPID-BAP assay was 1 copy/\u03bcL. To some extent, BEFV LFD-RPA outperforms RT-LAMP and real time qPCR: on the one hand, RPA reaction only utilizes two primers and one probe and three binding sites, in contrast, the RT-LAMP assay needs at least four primers and six binding sites, a higher reactive temperature (60\u201365 \u00b0C) [38]. On the other hand, RPA reagents provided in a lyophilized are stable even when stored for 3 weeks at 45 \u00b0C, which allow independence from the cooling chain [39]. Moreover, it only requires a simple heat block to run (38 \u00b0C) (Fig. 2) and the results can also be visualized by LFD with naked eyes inspection while the method of real-time-qPCR requires sophisticated instruments operated by specially trained personnel. What's more important, the study of analytical specificity is not only typically evaluated for etiologies that are likely to cause clinical presentations similar to the target etiology, but also evaluating those more closely related to BEFV that considered as potential sources of false-positives (Fig. 3B). It is worth mentioning that the high sensitivity and specificity of this lateral flow based detection systems assay gave the credit to good use of gold-labeled anti-FAM and anti-Biotin antibodies to capture RPA product simultaneously [40]. Although some biochemical methods including the flow type quartz crystal microbalance immunosensor have been published that are able to detect of BEFV [41], the procedure is somewhat complicated and requires the BEFV monoclonal antibodies on the gold surface of a quartzcrystal microbalance (QCM), and the whole process of this method needs to be operated by a professional personnel.",

As the applications of LFD-RPA, conventional RT-PCR and real time qPCR methods for detection BEFV genomes from clinical samples (Table 2), the results clearly indicated the potential benefits of the developed assay over PCR-based methods. Furthermore, it is much rapid than other nucleic acid tests at present and the reaction is performed at an ambient constant temperature instead of an expensive and sophisticated thermo cycler. However, the typical benefit of lateral-flow assays is their ability to be used as pen-side tests, this does not appear to be possible in this situation due to the requirement the prepared of BEFV genomes to make cDNA prior to performing the test. Therefore, it is possible that the performance of the BEFV RPA assay could be improved from that observed in this study.",
