This disease was first reported in the USA in 1987 and named \u201cblue-ear disease\u201d or \u201cmystery swine disease\u201d (Keffaber, 1989). The causative agent of the disease is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), which is a small-enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Arterivirida in the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997, Zimmerman et al., 1997). PRRS results in both reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease (pneumonia) in nursery and grower/finishing pigs (Rossow, 1998, Stevenson et al., 1993, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998).",

Because of its economic significance, a great deal of resource has been invested in developing effective prevention and control strategies. But protocols providing consistent success have been elusive due to the high rate of genetic change and antigenic variability (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995, Kapur et al., 1996, Halbur et al., 1996, Meng, 2000). A diagnosis of PRRSV infection is based mainly on typical clinical signs, seroconversion, characteristic light microscopic lesions and the demonstration of PRRSV by virus isolation, fluorescent antibody (FA) examination, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or PCR (Rossow et al., 1996, Rossow, 1998).",

            "text": "In June of 2006, outbreaks of highly pathogenic (acute, atypical) PRRS in most areas of China have been suggested to be caused by highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV (H-PRRSV) strains. From January to July 2007, 39455 morbid pigs died among 143,221 infected pigs according to the administrative files. Rapid spread of the viruses and their persistence in some environments have made the control of outbreaks difficult and, at times, even impossible. A rapid, sensitive, specific diagnostic method would be extremely useful for the diagnosis and control of the highly virulent PRRSV in China. The present highly virulent PRRSV of Chinese-type isolate which lead to widespread epidemic in China has 87 bps deleted in the fixed region of its Nsp2 gene as compared to normal strains (Tian et al., 2007). The current immunoassay is not capable of differentiating this mutant strain from the others, furthermore, the traditional RT-PCR method relies upon electrophoresis of the nucleic acids in the presence of ethidium bromide and visual or densitometric analysis of the resulting bands after irradiation by ultraviolet light (Kidd et al., 2000). Real-time RT-PCR use specific fluorescence-labeled probes or primers to monitor the accumulating amplicon in real time, real time and automatic testing saves time. Real-time RT-PCR is valuable for detecting various pathogens around the globe, built on the data generated by conventional RT-PCR (Matthews and Kricka, 1990, Lomeli et al., 1989, Bustin, 2000).",

The nucleotide sequence characteristics of H-PRRSV is that it has 87 bps deleted in the fixed region of Nsp2 gene by comparison to that of normal PRRSV, Thus, it provides an ideal site for designing a probe for real-time RT-PCR assay for H-PRRSV. In this paper, the TaqMan probe is oligonucleotides designed to bind to complementary target sequences presented within the Nsp2 gene of highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV. No probe binding to the Nsp2 gene sequence of normal PRRSV due to the addition of 87 bps in this region by comparison to that of H-PRRSV. There are no other reports of real-time RT-PCR techniques to differentiate H-PRRSV strains from other strains of PRRSV due to the similarity of the target sequence between H-PRRSV and normal PRRSV, the method developed could specifically detect the highly virulent Chinese-type PRRS virus that has 87 bps deleted in the fixed region of Nsp2 gene.",

Results are 100% consistent with that of sequencing, no false-positive samples were found, and the serum sample which obtained the lower Ct value but higher positive ratio as 78.31% may be due to the higher level of viral load in serum. The other reason may be attributed to the different extraction protocol between serum and tissues. Finally we can conclude that the lower Ct value and higher positive ratio clearly indicated that compared with tissue from lung and spleen, serum has a higher predicative value of detecting H-PRRSV infection during surveillance screening. In the comparison of the real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation for H-PRRSV, 5 strains of the H-PRRSV were positive by real-time RT-PCR but negative by virus isolation, it may due to that VI has a lower sensitivity or the infection of H-PRRSV is in its window period.
