The pain radiates straight through to her back. She has had progressive nausea with vomiting. The vomit is bile-stained and without blood. She has had similar but less severe episodes of abdominal pain in the past, usually after eating heavy meals, but they always resolved within a few hours. She is gravida two, para two, with last menses 2 weeks ago, and does not consume any alcohol. On exam, she is afebrile, heart rate is 115 beats/min, blood pressure of 128/86 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 18/min. Her abdomen is not distended. She has no surgical scars on her abdomen and no obvious masses visible. She has no bruising around her umbilicus or along her flank. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. She has marked tenderness to palpation in her epigastrium, without guarding or rebound. The remainder of her abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation. No masses or organomegaly are appreciated. Laboratory examination reveals a white blood cell count of 17.2 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (normal 4.1\u201310.9 \u00d7 103 cells/uL), amylase of 1545 u/L (30\u2013110 u/L), lipase of 1134 u/L (7\u201360 u/L), ALT of 245 u/L (7\u201356 u/L), AST of 263 u/L (5\u201335 u/L), serum glucose of 156 mg/dl (65\u2013110 mg/dL), and LDH 180 u/L (0\u2013250 u/L).

This may be a result of ERCP having a 5% risk of causing pancreatitis, related to over-injection of contrast medium into pancreatic ducts, and due to the fact that the majority of gallstones pass into the duodenum spontaneously. There is evidence to support endoscopic removal of common bile duct stones with ERCP and papillotomy if cholangitis is also present.
