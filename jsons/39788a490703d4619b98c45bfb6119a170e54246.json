Club cell protein 16 kDa (CC16) is a major pneumoprotein secreted by club cells of the bronchial epithelium and eliminated by the renal pathway. CC16 seems to be a biomarker of epithelial damage in asthma. However, its value as a marker of acute bronchiolitis severity and later recurrent wheezing are uncertain, especially the value of its urinary assay for this purpose. A prospective, observational, analytical study was conducted at Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital to correlate serum CC16 level with clinical severity of bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants aged less than 1 year. We analyzed correlations between serum and urinary CC16, CC16 levels and Wainwright score, immediate morbidity due to bronchiolitis, causal viruses, and recurrent wheezing",

In multivariate analysis, urinary CC16 correlated mainly with urinary retinol binding protein (RBP; r = 0.70; P < .001). The logCC16u/logRBPu ratio correlated significantly with severity (P = .02). CC16 levels were not correlated with recurrent wheezing at 1 year. Urinary CC16 could be a useful biomarker in acute bronchiolitis for specific indications. This noninvasive assay would be particularly useful in the young infant population. Several factors must be taken into account in its interpretation, mainly tubular function. Further studies are needed to assess these factors.",

Much effort has been made to identify novel biological markers measurable during the course of acute bronchiolitis for clinically effective prediction of disease severity and later wheezing. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Our team has studied epithelial injury biomarkers in acute bronchiolitis, but found no correlation between serum levels of KL-6 2 , or serum-soluble receptor for advanced glycation endproduct, 11 and severity of acute bronchiolitis and risk of wheezing bronchitis.",

In vitro, CC16 has an anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting phospholipase A2 activity, arachidonic acid production, and prostaglandin and leukotriene release, thereby countering several chronic pulmonary diseases. Its serum assay is often used to assess lung injury, but rarely its urinary assay. 14 The link between its levels and asthma has already been studied, [15] [16] [17] but its relation to acute bronchiolitis has received less attention. 18 We set out to determine whether CC16 could be a severity biomarker of epithelial damage during acute bronchiolitis and of recurrent wheezing in the sequelae.

Also, CC16u was correlated with severity score, duration of stay and type of stay, with higher values for the most severe cases. Increased CC16 levels during acute bronchiolitis could be the result of viral damage on the epithelial barrier, which is well described in fulminant forms. 21 A disruption of the epithelial barrier in the deep lung could lead to enhanced leakage of CC16 in the serum, and secondarily in urine. In our study, serum and urinary levels were correlated, suggesting that the discordant results could be explained in part by the limited number of blood samples compared to urine samples (91 vs 151 respectively).

The main variation factor for CC16u is likely to be tubular function. 22 To take account of this, we integrated the assay of RBP, a marker of tubular reabsorption function. Our multivariate analysis showed a strong correlation with RBP urinary levels. This argues for a systematic adjustment of CC16u by RBPu or another renal function marker such as urinary creatinine. LogCC16u/logRBPu was correlated to acute bronchiolitis severity, evaluated by the Wainwright score. Likewise, hydration status at the time of sampling should also be taken into account. The most severe cases were the youngest infants, who are most vulnerable to feeding difficulties, marked respiratory effort and subsequent dehydration. Other factors of variation need to be integrated in multivariable models for a precise interpretation of CC16 levels. Environmental factors, 13,23-25 physiological data such as age 26 and sex, time of sampling 14, 27 and physical activity 28 have been more fully described.",

They produce a protein of 1585 daltons (CC16), also produced by nonciliated tracheabronchus cells. This protein has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties on many cell types (epithelial cells, leukocytes). It protects the lung from inflammation related to allergens, viruses, cigarette smoking, and bleomycin. In mice, CC16 deficiencies increased ozone sensitivity and demonstrated an accelerated aging profile in lungs similar to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 20 F I G U R E 2 LogCC16s according to the Wainwright severity score.
