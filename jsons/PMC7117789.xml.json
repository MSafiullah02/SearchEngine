            "text": "Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi are five known species of human malaria parasites among which P. falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of malaria cases and deaths worldwide. The data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that there were about 228 million malaria cases including 405,000 deaths in 2018 (World Health Organization 2019). No dramatic reduction in malaria incidence rate in the period of 2015\u20132018. Over 40% of the world\u2019s population in more than 80 countries and areas is still at risk of contracting malaria. Nowadays malaria is preventable, treatable and curable. Reducing the contacts of people with mosquitoes is the core strategy to prevent and control the spread of malaria. A number of precautions such as decreasing mosquito breeding sites, sleeping under insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying with insecticides, are used for reducing malaria vectors and their bites. The artemisinin-based combination therapies are recommended by WHO as the fist-line treatments for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (World Health Organization 2015). So far there is only one approved malaria vaccine (RTS, S) with a relatively low efficacy, but requiring four injections (RTS, S Clinical Trials Partnership et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Mathematical models towards an understanding of the transmission dynamics of malaria have a history of over 100 years. The earliest model was proposed by Ross in 1911 who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for being the discoverer of the life cycle of malarial parasite (Ross 1911). Macdonald extended Ross\u2019 basic model by considering superinfection and developed the entomological theory and the quantitative theory of malaria control (Macdonald 1957). The so-called Ross\u2013Macdonald model captures the essential feature of malaria transmission and the modeling framework has been widely adopted to study the epidemiology of malaria and other mosquito-borne or even vector-borne diseases (Reiner et al. 2013). Dietz et al. (1974) and Aron (1988) conducted a modeling study on acquired immunity for whom has ever suffered from malaria. Aron and May (1982) formed an SIRS model with constant infection rate to fit data on age-prevalence curves. Ngwa and Shu (2000) established a compartmental model with an SEIRS pattern for humans and an SEI pattern for mosquitoes. Their model was later extended by Chitnis et al. (2006) through including constant immigration of susceptible humans and generalizing mosquito biting rate. Hasibeder and Dye (1988) and Gao et al. (2019) showed that nonhomogeneous mixing between humans and mosquitoes leads to a higher basic reproduction number using Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches, respectively. Ruan et al. (2008) proposed a delayed Ross\u2013Macdonald model in consideration of the incubation periods of parasites within both humans and mosquitoes. Abu-Raddad et al. (2006) and Mukandavire et al. (2009) studied the influence of the interaction between HIV and malaria in a community. Differences in susceptibility, exposedness and infectivity between non-immune and semi-immune human hosts for malaria transmission were investigated by Ducrot et al. (2009). Chamchod and Britton (2011) introduced a vector-bias model with vital dynamics to account for the greater attractiveness of infectious humans to mosquitoes. A theoretical model for evaluating the effectiveness of malaria control using genetically modified mosquitoes was developed and analyzed by Diaz et al. (2011). In addition, environmental changes (Li et al. 2002; Parham and Michael 2010), seasonal human migration (Gao et al. 2014b) and drug resistance (Koella and Antia 2003) were also considered in malaria models.",

            "text": "Quarantine is a public health control strategy in containing infectious diseases by separating exposed or sick persons from the healthy population. As early as the 14th century, ships arriving in Venice from areas infected with plague were required to wait forty days before landing. The essential of quarantine is to prevent infectious individuals from contacting with susceptible individuals. This measure is effective even for newly emerging infectious diseases caused by unidentified infectious agents. Quarantine has been widely used in the control of COVID-19, SARS, Ebola, Bubonic plague, measles, tuberculosis, H7N9, typhoid fever, etc. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of quarantine for controlling and eliminating infectious diseases. Feng and Thieme (1995) formulated a perfect quarantine model where a proportion of infected people stay at home and do not infect anybody and showed that the model can give rise to sustained oscillations. Hethcote et al. (2002) analyzed six types of SIQS and SIQR models to explore which one can produce periodic solutions. Gumel et al. (2004) used models to examine the effectiveness of quarantine and isolation on the control of SARS outbreaks. Tang et al. (2012) proposed a dynamic model to evaluate the influence of campus quarantine for curbing the H1N1 outbreak in the Chinese city of Xi\u2019an during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Pandey et al. (2014) developed a compartmental model for Ebola transmission to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., quarantine, case isolation, and sanitary burial practices) for curtailing the epidemic in Liberia. Erdem et al. (2017) studied the impact of imperfect quarantine on the dynamics of an SIR-type model.",

A number of countries are on the road to malaria elimination. However, imported infections pose the greatest threat for maintaining the elimination status. For example, a National Malaria Elimination Programme was launched in China in 2010, aiming at achieving national malaria elimination by 2020 (Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2010). Imported cases account for over 98% of the total malaria cases in China since 2014 (Feng et al. (2018), see Fig. 1). The situation leads to the theme of National Malaria Day in China since 2015 being \u201cMalaria eradication: preventing imported cases\u201d. For a malaria-free or low transmission country or region, it is feasible to quarantine sporadic imported or autochthonous cases to limit the disease transmission from humans to mosquitoes. Meanwhile, malaria patients get less mosquito bites when they receive treatment and health care in hospitals or at homes.",

We also used the second additive compound matrix method to establish the global stability of the endemic equilibrium under certain condition. Finally, three numerical examples on the standard incidence model were carried out to further explore the impact of quarantine on malaria persistence and control. The first example confirmed the occurrence of backward bifurcation with biologically acceptable parameter settings.

Results suggest that the most important factor in achieving a successful quarantine for malaria is to reduce the biting rate of the quarantined people other than to quarantine more infected people at earlier infection stage. It is therefore very important to provide health advice (e.g., wear protective clothing and stay in mosquito-free accommodation) and essential supplies (e.g., insecticide-treated bed nets and mosquito repellent) to malaria patients such that the possibility of exposure to mosquito bites is dramatically reduced.",

Generally speaking, if the ratio of mosquitoes to humans is small, then it is proper to choose the standard incidence. Otherwise, the bilinear or saturated incidence rate is a preferred choice (Chitnis et al. 2006).

The quarantine strategy is traditionally used for controlling diseases that are transmissible from human to human. We must address that quarantine is applicable to the control and elimination of malaria only if a low transmission region with a limited number of imported or autochthonous cases is concerned. For mosquito-borne diseases, we quarantine suspected and confirmed cases not these who have contacts with patients or have been exposed to malaria parasites with no symptoms. Moreover, quarantine becomes more practical if fast, low-cost and highly sensitive diagnostic kits for malaria are available.",

For example, the extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes and intrinsic incubation period in humans, seasonal fluctuations in the mosquito population, acquired immunity in humans, differential susceptibility and infectivity of humans to malaria infection, imperfect malaria vaccine, differences in attractiveness to mosquitoes, and spatial heterogeneity. Quarantined people who receive better treatment and care may have a shorter period of infectiousness or a lower parasitemia level. The use of quarantine is less beneficial when there is a high proportion of asymptomatic or subclinical infections. It is worth mentioning that modeling quarantine and/or isolation under exponential distribution assumption (EDA) may result in biased outcomes in understanding dynamic behaviors and assessing control measures (Feng et al. 2007). Models that make no contradiction in terms of the basic reproduction number, endemic equilibrium, infectious period and other epidemiological characteristics, but remain mathematically tractable are most desirable. Non-exponential distribution assumptions such as gamma distribution assumption (GDA) may yield an improvement on the model under EDA (Feng et al. 2007, 2016). The framework of the current work can be adopted to the study of the prevention and control of other mosquito-borne or vector-borne diseases, especially these having a relatively short infectious period.",
