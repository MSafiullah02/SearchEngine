Based on the use of carrier proteins with chemically coupled peptide antigens as promising vaccine candidates [19], Haynes et al. [20] generated an experimental vaccine using a gene engineering approach instead of chemical coupling. They combined the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) CP gene with an extension encoding a C-terminally located, 8 AA-long antigenic peptide from poliovirus. The resulting VLPs purified from recombinant bacterial cells were immunogenic and stimulated the formation of antibodies against poliovirus in rats. These results, together with those of HBsAg [21], introduced the use of VLPs as a central carrier element of many experimental and licensed vaccines. Additionally, the study clearly demonstrates that nonpathogenic viruses are also suitable for vaccine generation after the introduction of relevant antigens into their structure.",

Most likely, the most important property of viruses and VLPs is their structural organization. Structurally, viruses are constructed of hundreds or thousands of highly ordered CP molecules, which serve as repeated antigens for the mammalian immune system. These antigens on the virus surface can stimulate B cells by crosslinking B cell receptors and induce long-lasting antibody responses. In addition, most viruses have the optimal size, shape and rigidity to enter the lymphatic system through the pores in lymph vessels. This facilitates the trafficking of viral particles and VLPs to lymph nodes and their uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Moreover, viruses and VLPs encapsulate specific host-derived nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), which stimulate Toll-like receptors in APCs and serve as natural vaccine adjuvants [23,24].",

It is well known that plant viruses are not able to infect mammalian organisms. Therefore, the probability of pre-existing immunity against plant viruses is considerably lower compared with that against VLPs derived from mammalian viruses (e.g., HBV and papilloma virus). Most plant viruses are assembled from single or a few CP molecules and demonstrate remarkable structural flexibility, allowing different manipulations, such as disassembly/reassembly, as well as chemical and genetic modifications. This enables the rational design of vaccines and the introduction of different antigens derived from infectious agents, allergens and self-molecules. Additionally, plant VLPs and other artificially generated VLPs do not contain replicating nucleic acids. This prevents the reversion of vaccines into infectious viruses, which is a serious risk factor for attenuated viral vaccines. From a technological viewpoint, plant viruses and VLPs can be produced in different recombinant hosts (bacteria, yeasts, plants, and eukaryotic cells) under cGMP conditions; the mentioned structural flexibility of plant viruses allows the construction of universal vaccine platforms [25,26].",

Our literature search demonstrates the rapidly growing interest in plant viruses as vaccine carriers; for example, a cumulative search for the term \u2018\u2018plant virus vaccine\u2019\u2019 in Web of Science yielded 787 publication records through 2009, more than 1400 through 2014, and at least 2204 publications through the end of 2019. As revealed by the search, plant virus derivatives serve as components for at least 71 experimental vaccines against infectious diseases, 16 anti-cancer vaccines and 10 vaccines against allergies and autoimmune diseases (examples and literature citations are summarized in Supplemental Tables S2, S3 and S4). The increasing interest and recent publications stimulated us to summarize and discuss the latest developments in the design of vaccines based on plant viruses. Descriptions of other plant VLP applications can be found in several recent review articles [34,35,36,37,38].",

            "text": "In most cases, plant virus-derived vaccines are peptide vaccines that are genetically fused or chemically coupled to viral CP. Peptide vaccines can stimulate the formation of neutralizing antibodies and ensure protection against the corresponding pathogen in animal models (Suppl. Table S2). The advantages of this approach include the reduced influence of short peptides on the structural integrity of viral carriers and the easy production of experimental vaccines. However, the antigen is frequently not a linear AA sequence but a spatially complex structure involving different parts of the antigenic protein. For such antigens, peptide-based vaccines are not suitable for stimulating protection via the immune response. Therefore, several authors have suggested the usage of whole proteins as antigens, which can result in epitope structures closely related to native ones and elicit neutralizing antibodies after immunizations. Genetic fusions of whole antigenic proteins with viral CPs negatively influence VLP formation in most cases. However, sometimes plant viral coats are able to accommodate even very long antigenic sequences on their surfaces [40,41]. As alternatives to genetic fusions, other approaches can result in antigen presentation, such as chemical coupling or physical binding of the antigen to the VLP surface using binding partner molecules. Successful examples of the generation of vaccines using the chemical or enzymatic coupling of whole antigens include studies of experimental vaccines against Francisella tularensis [42], influenza [43], Yersinia pestis [44], Plasmodium vivax [45], and Zika virus [46].",

The first such vaccine is an edible vaccine against rabies containing a recombinant antigen derived from rabies virus proteins (a fusion of peptides derived from the G and N proteins) incorporated in the N-terminus of the Alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV). Introduction of the chimeric gene into the TMV-based plant vector and transient expression in spinach leaves resulted in AlMV-like particles exposing rabies epitopes. The inclusion of raw spinach leaves containing these VLPs in the diet of human volunteers led to significant antibody responses to rabies virus and plant virus carriers [48,49]. This pioneering study clearly demonstrates the potential of plant virus-based carriers for the generation of human vaccines. Later, several vaccine candidates were constructed based on AlMV carriers (Figure 3A [41,50]).",

Vaccine candidates produced in whole plants under cGMP conditions demonstrate acceptable safety and tolerability and induce antibodies against Pfs25, depending on the injected vaccine dose.

Vaccine formulations containing VLPs increased antibody production against TRAP compared to that produced by the antigen alone.

It began with the first observations of the significant regression of sarcomas in patients after accidental infection by a Streptococcus bacterium. In 1891, William Coley, an American surgeon, used heat-inactivated bacteria to treat a large number of patients suffering from inoperable cancers. His therapy method resulted in the cure of more than 1000 patients. However, the method was later replaced with radiation and chemotherapy due to dangerous infection risks and the absence of reproducible results. The next important milestone in the development of cancer immunotherapy was the finding of Old et al. in 1959, which demonstrated the antitumor activity of the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG) in a mouse model. The vaccine has been introduced for the treatment of bladder cancer and has been used in clinics since the 1970s. These and other key events in cancer immunology are discussed in several recent review articles [61,62].",

Three different icosahedral plant virus-derived nanoparticles with chemically coupled breast cancer epitopes efficiently elicited the formation of antibodies against the HER2 receptor, which is overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Additionally, all three vaccines stimulated T-cell-mediated immune responses when tested separately. Sequential use of these vaccines reduced the immune responses against VLP carriers and improved the formation of antibodies against the HER2 peptide. This suggested prime-boost strategy considerably reduced tumor development and enhanced the survival rate in a mouse tumor model. The study clearly demonstrated that the Th1-type immune response, including the formation of IgG2a antibodies, the secretion of IFNg and the activation of CD4+/CD8+ T-cells, is the most important factor for immunotherapy. Interestingly, plant VLPs derived from CPMV demonstrated better immunotherapeutic properties than those derived from Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV). Therefore, additional studies are needed to understand the differences between different plant VLPs used as carriers for anticancer vaccines [70].

The results suggest the superior immune-stimulating properties of CPMV compared with those of other structural variants of TMV and confirm that antigen multiplicity is one of the most important factors involved in eliciting a strong immune response. One possible explanation for the enhanced immune-stimulating properties of CPMV in a mouse melanoma model is the ability of VLPs to recruit monocytes into the tumor microenvironment, leading to the infiltration of neutrophils and natural killer cells and resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Authors suggest that the intrinsic properties of some plant viruses allow them to be developed as cancer vaccines for clinical use; however, the detailed mechanisms of immune stimulation remain to be elucidated [71].",

Similar to that of food allergies, current cat allergy treatment includes the avoidance of exposure, the use of anti-histamines and steroids and long-term subcutaneous immunotherapy. All these measures are only partially effective in eliminating allergic reactions; additionally, immunotherapy is bound to result in safety issues. The predominant cat allergen is the secretoglobulin Fel d 1, which is secreted by cat sebaceous and salivary glands. We generated a CMV-based vaccine containing recombinant Fel d 1 allergen using chemical coupling and demonstrated that VLP coupling effectively reduces allergic reactions, stimulates the formation of Fel d 1-specific IgGs and protects sensitized mice against anaphylactic shock [76]. Moreover, Bachmann and collaborators proposed a new strategy for the treatment of Fel d 1 allergy involving immunizing cats against their own Fel d 1 allergen. The induced anti\u2013Fel d 1 antibodies exhibited a strong neutralization ability and might result in reduced symptoms in allergic cat owners [81].",

The eosinophil count can be effectively reduced by a specific humanized anti-IL5 mAb, which is used for treatment of human asthma [86]. Active vaccination with a plant VLP-IL5 conjugate instead of a mAb induced a potent IL5 antibody response in horses, reducing the symptoms of insect bite hypersensitivity.

One of them is the time required to bring a new vaccine from the development phase to the market, which can exceed 15 years, including 7 years on average for the design, construction, validation and commencement of industrial manufacture. The next factor is the significant human and financial resources necessary for the development and sustainable on-demand production of vaccines. The vaccine industry has to continuously solve problems, such as long life cycles of vaccines, high facility costs and the complexity of global vaccine demand [92,93]. Long vaccine development periods are an additional challenge negatively influencing the availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, Zika virus, Chickungunja virus and others [94]. Moreover, the chosen antigen structure used for vaccine manufacturing can be different from the corresponding native antigen, reducing or even preventing the neutralizing ability of the generated antibodies. This aspect critically influences the development process of vaccines against pathogens, especially against infectious agents with high genetic variation. HIV is an example of such a pathogen, against which there is no effective vaccine despite many years of effort by academic scientists and the vaccine industry [95]. One other challenging aspect that should be mentioned here as a factor that is possibly important for vaccine development in the future is the fact that the latest studies suggest that the microbiome in the digestive track of recipients can influence the efficacy of vaccines. The effect is observed both in humans and in laboratory mice, suggesting the need for further investigation [96].",
