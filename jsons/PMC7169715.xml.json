During the 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons, patients who sought care for respiratory symptoms at Jahurul Islam Medical College Hospital, two district health complexes, and six local pharmacies in rural Kishoreganj District, Bangladesh, were recruited as index\u2010case patients. Study physicians screened patients for the presence of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI), which was defined as fever in those less than 5 years of age and fever with cough or sore throat in those 5 years or older. As this study was investigating transmission of influenza at the household level, patients who were admitted to the hospital were ineligible to participate. Consenting index\u2010case patients were accompanied to their home by study staff. Typically, residents of this area live with extended family members in compounds of several households, sometimes with a shared cooking space and a latrine. If at least two people other than the index\u2010case patient intended to reside in the compound for the subsequent 20 days, we sought to enumerate and enrol all members of the compound (Figure 1).",

We examined the following household\u2010level characteristics as potential risk factors for secondary ILI: crowding, building materials of homes, exposure to indoor air pollution, presence of handwashing materials, water source, latrine quality and sharing, education of the household respondent and household wealth status. Crowding was assessed as number of people per room (the number of people in the household divided by the number of rooms in the home, excluding latrine and kitchen). We assessed indicators of exposure to indoor air pollution, such as frequency of smoking in the home, cooking fuel use, building material of the home and the distance between the cooking and sleeping spaces. We observed handwashing materials, soap and/or water at a handwashing station 28. We defined latrine quality as improved (flush/pour flush to piped sewer system, septic tank or pit latrine; or pit latrine with slab) or unimproved (flush/pour flush to elsewhere, open pit latrine, bucket, hanging latrine or no facility/bush/field), according to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. For socio\u2010economic status, we examined education level of the household respondent and developed a wealth index using principal component analysis of household assets 29.

We examined sex and wealth status of the susceptible household contact, as well as any factors associated with risk of ILI in the bivariate models (P < 0.05) as potential confounders.

Exposure to indoor air pollution is a well\u2010established risk factor for all\u2010cause acute respiratory infections, due to its detrimental effects on respiratory tissue and immune functioning in the respiratory tract 31, 32, 33. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is also a well\u2010established risk factor for numerous other conditions, including low birthweight, various cancers and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases 34. The prevalence of smoking in the home was high in this study, highlighting the need for tobacco control measures in Bangladesh. Greater use of effective tobacco control measures, such as taxation, could help to reduce tobacco smoking prevalence in Bangladesh 35. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey estimated that 45% of adult men in Bangladesh smoke tobacco products 36. In contrast, only 1.5% of adult women in Bangladesh smoke. Our study showed a lower proportion of men who smoke (29%) compared with the Global Adult Tobacco Survey. In our study, the household head reported tobacco smoking for all members of the household; it is possible that respondents may underreport smoking habits of other household members. Although biomass fuels are considered to be the major source of indoor air pollution in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries 19, 32, 37, we were unable to assess the effect of biomass fuel use on secondary ILI, as nearly every participant (96.7%) reported using biomass fuels for cooking.",

Although shared latrines have not previously been shown to be associated with respiratory infections, there is some evidence of an association between shared latrines and diarrhoeal disease 38, 39. Shared latrines may not be cleaned as frequently as private latrines 38, so it is possible that pathogens remain present longer on surfaces in shared latrines compared with private latrines. Contact transmission, by either direct contact with infected fluids or indirect contact via fomites, may be an important route of transmission for influenza and other respiratory pathogens 40, 41 as well as diarrhoeal pathogens 38. Contaminated fomites in shared latrines, such as doors and traditional pots used for anal washing after defecation, may provide a route of transmission for pathogens in Bangladesh. As ILI may be caused by many different pathogens, it is possible that shared latrines may expose users to a number of different pathogens that may cause ILI symptoms. Specifically, influenza viruses 42, 43 and coronaviruses 44 have been recovered from faeces of patients, suggesting that some respiratory viruses may be transmitted through faecal contact. Interactions with people with influenza have been shown to be associated with risk of secondary influenza 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and ILI 26; it is plausible that those who use shared sanitation may have increased interactivity due to a commonly used resource (latrine). We did not observe an association between multiple daily interactions with the index\u2010case patient and shared latrine use. However, we were unable to thoroughly investigate this possibility due to limited data. It is also possible that the association between sharing a latrine and ILI may be spurious or that latrine sharing represents a proxy for an unknown factor that is associated with ILI, but the effect estimates did not change substantially when adjusted for measures of wealth, age or smoking making this a less likely explanation.",

Residing in the index\u2010case patient's household was not associated with ILI risk, indicating that all members of a compound in a densely populated area are at risk of contracting infectious diseases from their compound members or the community at large.",

We do not know whether pathogens were transmitted between members of the same household compound, whether they were acquired outside of the compound or whether the index\u2010case patient we identified is in fact the primary ILI case in each compound. It is possible that control households had contact with intervention households and subsequently modified handwashing behaviour. However, our main study results do not suggest an association between handwashing and secondary ILI, so contact with the intervention arm is unlikely to have affected our results. As few participants had influenza, we did not test for other pathogens, and our definition of ILI for those under 5 years was broad, our results may not be relevant to influenza transmission, but rather, transmission of respiratory pathogens more broadly. Air pollution is a well\u2010established household\u2010level risk factor for respiratory illness 31, 32, 33, but reliable data on concentrations of household air pollutants are not available from this study. However, we did observe associations between indoor smoking, one proxy indicator of air pollution and secondary ILI incidence. As this study recruited participants from selected healthcare facilities, our sample may not be representative of people who sought care elsewhere 3, 5. In addition, our sample may not be generalisable to urban Bangladesh, where there may be more crowding and more accessible health care.",
