In this paper we present a legal search problem where professionals monitor news articles with constant queries on a periodic basis. Firstly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using traditional retrieval models against the Boolean search of documents in chronological order. In an attempt to capture the complex information needs of users, a learning to rank approach is adopted with user specified relevance criteria as features. This approach, however, only achieves mediocre results compared to the traditional models. However, we find that by fine-tuning a contextualised language model (e.g. BERT), significantly improved retrieval performance can be achieved, providing a flexible solution to satisfying complex information needs without explicit feature engineering.",

The users monitor a specific legal topic by querying the news stream with that topic periodically and all the retrieved results are tagged with a relevance judgment for later usage. Given this context, we group the data into equal intervals corresponding to the report creation times and evaluate the retrieved results per interval. The initial ranked lists were generated by using the Boolean query created by the users, and ranked in a chronological order. We apply the alternative ranking approaches as a re-ranking task. In total the dataset consists 206 queries and 60,512 labelled news articles, among which 2,872 (21%) are marked as relevant. By grouping the searches into the equal interval and removing sessions with no relevant articles, we obtain 1,774 search sessions (i.e. query-results pairs). The average number of relevant articles per-session varies from 1.5 to 4.4 articles depending on the queries. We randomly split the dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. The same setup holds for both traditional retrieval models as well as for L2R approaches. We use the validation set to tune the models' parameters.",

We see that all retrieval models significantly outperform the Boolean search results for all measures. This suggests that without further effort in terms of feature engineering and model fitting, traditional models already improve the ranking quality by capturing topical relevance. Further, we see that different fields may be best for one model but not for the other, suggesting that their combination in a L2R approach may be beneficial.

In particular, topical features (i.e. a linear combination of the traditional models and different fields) does not provide better performance compared to Dir. However, among the different type of features, LambdaMART with all features performs the best, suggesting that both types of features are somewhat useful in capturing the relevance criteria. In response to RQ2, these results imply that the L2R approach with explicit feature engineering does not achieve a competitive performance-perhaps, hand-crafted features were not able to match well with the user specified relevance criteria. Next, we observe that BERT based approaches significantly outperform Dir. In particular, in terms of SL, with the baseline a user would need to read on average 5.5 irrelevant documents before finding all relevant documents, while with BERT based models this is reduced to less than 2, providing potentially improved user experience. Moreover, compared to explicit feature engineering, fine tuning BERT seems to have captured the user information needs in an implicit manner. This is encouraging as it not only learns the complex relevance criteria more accurately, but also provides more flexibility as the model can be fine tuned for use cases with different criteria without dedicated feature engineering.",

From a user perspective, this means users may be able to confidently stop reading results after seeing certain number of irrelevant results, which would be particularly useful when the result list is long and relevant articles are few. On the other hand, we should also be aware that as the model complexity increases, there is decreasing model explainability and user controllability-the properties of Boolean search appreciated by professional users [16, 24] . Therefore for future work we find it crucial to investigate methods that explain and control complex models such as BERT.",

We found that, compared to Boolean search, traditional retrieval models are effective in improving the ranking quality and reducing user effort in finding relevant information (e.g. measured by SL). Learning to rank with explicit feature encoding does not seem to be able to easily improve over traditional models. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (BERT) shows strong improvements over both traditional models and L2R models, with the advantage of not requiring dedicated feature encoding. In particular, our study opens up a number of research questions in the context of professional search: (i) what kind of features allow pre-trained LMs to capture the implicit information needs from users' relevance judgements? (ii) what are the limitations of pre-trained LMs to capture fine-grained information needs? and; (iii) how does the above depend on the number and quality of the relevance judgements, particularly in the case of niche retrieval tasks?",
