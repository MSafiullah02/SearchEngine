In fact, health care personnel who had close contact with MERS patients were at a high risk for infection (Alraddadi et al., 2016) . Previous studies support our results. During the MERS epidemic, health care workers felt fearful about being infected; however, they continued to work during the epidemic as it was their professional and ethical duty (Al-Dorzi et al., 2016; Khalid, Khalid, Qabajah, Barnard, & Qushmaq, 2016) . Emergency room nurses working during the outbreak of MERS also expressed high concerns about being infected, and that they would have like to avoid caring for patients with MERS if there was a choice (Choi & Kim, 2016) . These fears of nurses could be reduced by sharing the correct information about the quality of the protection devices they wear and appropriate ways to use them to prevent the transmission of infection (Speroni et al., 2015) . In addition, hospitals experiencing MERS epidemic suggested that institutional plans be made in advance to provide personal safety equipment when there is a rapid increase in its demand (Al-Dorzi et al., 2016; Stirling, Hatcher, & Harmston, 2017) . However, our participants mentioned discomfort in wearing PPE. Likewise, a study on a simulation exercise for health care workers wearing PPE in a hospital in the UK reported that they found the PPE uncomfortable, and even basic tasks took longer than usual while wearing it (Phin et al., 2009) . Thus, feedback from nurses on protection devices would help medical equipment companies design more comfortable medical protection equipment.",

Additionally, hospitals implemented various programs for health care professionals to reward or appreciate their hard work during the outbreak.

In a study, nurses who took care of H1N1 high-risk infected patients and who worked in an isolated area in Taiwan said that nurses needed counselling services (Honey & Wang, 2013) .

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia in April 2012 (Al-Tawfiq, Omrani, & Memish, 2016). Camels are considered as a carrier for MERS-CoV transmission in humans. The possible transmission modes are droplet and contact spread (Bhatia, Sethi, Gupta, & Biyani, 2016). The 2015 MERS-CoV epidemic in South Korea has been the largest outbreak of MERS outside Middle East. The first person (index patient) with MERS-CoV in Korea was a 68-year-old man who had returned from the Middle East.

As part of this program, patients with respiratory disease saw clinicians in secured areas instead of outpatient clinics or emergency rooms, used a separate room in case of hospitalization, and were tested for MERS-CoV before being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) to minimize the transmission of the virus. During MERS outbreaks, 186 Koreans had been exposed to MERS in hospitals as of July 15, 2015. Both patients and health care personnel (doctors, nurses, and emergency medical transporters) were confirmed with a MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals, and 36 deaths were reported (Balkhy et al., 2016; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Yang et al., 2015).",

This result supports the notion that when a new infection outbreak occurs, changing the guidelines too frequently could confuse clinicians, making it difficult for them to follow the guidelines. Therefore, hospitals should develop an infectious disease epidemic control plan in advance, which includes standardized care protocols and communication with national health services as previous studies suggested from their own experience during the outbreak(Al-Dorzi et al., 2016;Stirling et al., 2017).In addition, nurses taking care of MERS-infected patients reported that they had a hard time when they received negative feedback from peers or family members.Choi and Kim (2016) also found that the social stigma for nurse themselves and their families resulting from their work with MERS patients was the most influential factor of ethical problems that nurses experienced during the MERS outbreak. It would be helpful for peers and family members to understand and support nurses who decide to get involved in caring for infected patients. Furthermore, it is necessary to provide the accurate information during the early stage of disease outbreak to lower the level of worry among people, in particular those having a high daily life stress and poor self-rated health status(Ro, Lee, Kang, & Jung, 2017).During the H1N1 outbreak, nurses caring for infected and high-risk patients reported that they felt lonely in the isolation room(Honey & Wang, 2013). Our result shows that communicating with other nurses using messengers was helpful to support each other and gain information from their colleagues. Nevertheless, our participants stated that their PPE was a barrier to communicate. Interphones between anteroom and isolation room were good to listen to but not to speak while wearing PPE. Hence, effective communication channels should be established for the nurses caring for infected patients during the outbreak to help them get emotional support while working hard in wearing PPE.",
