Health concerns, which were previously thought to belong to another society or another part of the world, are fast becoming universal. The outbreak of a mystery killer bug, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which has swept through Hong Kong, Vietnam, and China, and is now affecting the UK, emphasises the need for global networking and cooperation.",

Taiwan was swift to report its cases of SARS, and is ready and eager to participate in world health issues.",

Figures show that the disease is the most threatening epidemic of present times, with 5 million individuals infected with HIV-1 worldwide in 2002. In Taiwan, measures have been implemented to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. The measures include free medical care for patients with confirmed HIV-1, a comprehensive blood-screening system, and better training of doctors, nurses, and health administrators. Furthermore, action is not just restricted to the domestic front; Taiwan is also involved in Care France's AIDS prevention programme in Chad, and helps to promote antiAIDS campaigns in Burkina Faso and Swaziland. In 2002, Taiwan also donated US$1 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.",

Although having both the right and the necessary requirements for joining, the country is excluded from the organisation because of China's opposition. Yet, since when has health been a political issue? WHO's constitution states that their objective is \u201cto provide health for all peoples\u201d; Taiwan's exclusion is therefore a form of health apartheid.",
