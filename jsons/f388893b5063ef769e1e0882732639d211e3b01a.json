One of many challenges faced by our ED as COVID-19 emerged was how best to communicate effectively with physicians, nurses and other staff amidst unprecedented rates of operational change and new clinical data. ED schedules make rapid communication of change to an entire clinical staff difficult. Yet, the threat of COVID-19 to staff and patient safety made rapid adoption of change critically important. We therefore sought a strategy to disseminate new information in timely and digestible ways.",

In normal times, our operations team meets twice per month, making changes to protocols and workflows after most meetings. Since our ED COVID-19 response began six weeks ago, the operations team has met daily and made substantial changes to protocols and workflows nearly every day. Some changes flow from our Hospital Incident Command System (HICS). Others occur in response to operational patterns and problems we directly observe or learn of through our quality and safety reporting infrastructure. Finally, as we learn more about COVID-19, clinical guidance evolves as well. Disseminating this volume of consequential information to staff required methods beyond our usual communication strategies.",

American Journal of Emergency Medicine xxx (xxxx) xxx The goal in each communication is to provide the minimum amount of information necessary, with strategic bolding to highlight crucial details. Each message also contains hospital and departmental data about COVID-19, which our clinicians have expressed a desire to receive frequently. With one person delivering messaging no more than once per dayand desired data presented alongside operational updateswe have increased the value and clarity of our department's communications. Having the same person write e-mails and update the rounding document also ensures that information is consistent across both mediums. Additionally, messages that are role-group specific are sent only to that group by their leadership to avoid cluttering others' inboxes.",

We have found that practice consistently changes in desired ways after an initial email providing new guidance is followed by 1-2 days of reinforcement during rounds. Staff across role groups have expressed appreciation for receiving up-to-date information through multiple avenues on a daily basis, particularly through in-person rounding. We have also received feedback that of the many hospital-affiliated emails they receive daily, ours is the one ED staff read fully. However, we have also recently received requests for an online database of COVID-19 information, as it has become challenging to find guidance from prior communications now that we are six weeks into our COVID-19 response. We are currently constructing such an online platformaccessible via mobile phonewhere the most important information disseminated through our three streams will be immediately available. This multipronged and continuously evolving communication strategy has been vital for optimal ED performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
