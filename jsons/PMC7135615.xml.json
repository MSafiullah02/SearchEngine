Ideally, the clinical safety of breathing filters and reuse of the breathing systems would need to be evaluated by comparing the incidence of postoperative respiratory tract infections with the incidence associated with the standard practice of using a sterile system for every patient [9]. Other noninfectious risks associated with breathing filters include barotrauma and pneumothorax caused by obstruction of the filter, air leak, inefficient ventilation, and disconnection of the breathing system [8].",

However, in 2002, an agreement was reached between the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, the health authorities, and medical device manufacturers [2]. Breathing systems in the U.K. now have new filter products with licenses for multiple uses up to one week, if a new filter is placed at the Y-piece of the system for each patient. In addition, it is recommended that the breathing system be inspected regularly and the circuit be exchanged if visibly soiled or after use in a patient with a highly infectious disease [10].",

The filtration performance of pleated hydrophobic membrane filters is greater than that of electrostatic filters. In addition, pleated hydrophobic filters prevent liquid contamination of breathing systems [12]. Another positive feature of a breathing filter is its capability of retaining airborne latex particles [13].",

Material and labor costs between different practices (change of the anesthesia breathing circuits after each patient versus the use of a hydrophobic HME-F with daily or weekly change of the circuit) were compared.

For this analysis we assumed the breathing circuit would also be replaced in 10% of cases because it was visibly soiled after the previous case, or with a patient with special infectious disease status (eg, tuberculosis, HIV, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, avian influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome). With breathing system reuse, 9,568 circuits would have been needed such that purchasing costs for breathing circuits would have been $68, 890. The purchasing costs for breathing filters would have been 21, 137 \u00d7 $2.50, or $52, 843. With the reuse of breathing circuits, the total purchasing costs for breathing circuits and filters would have been $121, 733. Our findings confirmed the results of a similar study that showed savings of up to $50, 000 per year in a facility with about 60 general anesthetics per day [14]. Nevertheless, estimated cost savings can differ widely depending on the manufacturer, type, and quality of breathing filter used, and the purchase agreement. For example, pleated paper hydrophobic breathing filters may be more expensive than electrostatic felted polypropylene filters. Under such circumstances the cost of the former may exceed the cost of a disposable circle breathing system.",
