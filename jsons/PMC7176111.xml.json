All members of the order Carnivora are thought to be susceptible, and CDV exposure has also been described in several species of rodents, primates, suids, cervids, and elephants [1]. Significant mortality events have been described in terrestrial and marine mammals [2], and disease and outbreaks in endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) [3], Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) [4], Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) [5\u20137], Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) [8], Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) [9], and black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) [10] are considered potentially significant conservation threats to these species. Domestic dogs and mesocarnivores are known reservoir hosts [2,6,7]. The virus is epitheliotropic, lymphotropic and neurotropic, and clinical signs are often seen in the respiratory, lymphoid, gastrointestinal and nervous systems [11]. Common outcomes of infection include lymphoid depletion, hyperkeratosis, interstitial pneumonia (often complicated by opportunistic bacterial infections), and fatal encephalopathy.",

            "text": "POC diagnostics can help address many challenges in understanding CDV presence, transmission patterns, identification of disease outbreaks, and conservation threats in wildlife. Some of these challenges include access to animals and opportunistic testing across small and large geographic ranges, low density or elusive behavior of some target species, and absence of or limited monitoring efforts. Others challenges researchers face include limited expertise necessary for appropriate animal sample collection, handling, and storage (including maintaining a cold chain), absence of available laboratory testing and differentiating from disease such as rabies which can present with similar clinical manifestations, and/or logistical challenges related to permit processes needed for regional or international sample shipping for laboratory testing. These challenges are compounded in remote and/or low resource settings. POC diagnostics are increasingly providing opportunities for rapid testing by researchers while they are already collecting data in the field, or when handling sick or dead wildlife, and with the development and validation of more user-friendly kits, researchers have opportunities to overcome many of these obstacles and logistical challenges that would normally impede testing.",

The Biomeme M1 Sample Prep Kit\u2122 for RNA extraction is pre-packaged and uses a syringe-mounted extraction column (Fig 1, top). Through the use of four color-coded reagents, the extraction process easily overcomes training and language barriers. The Biomeme LyoRNA\u2122 mastermix is lyophilized and shelf-stable. It can be combined with lyophilized primers and probes into a bead that is pre-packaged into Biomeme qPCR reaction tube \u2018Go-Strips\u2019\u2122. Reagents, primers and probes can be manufactured to meet specific needs. Reconstitution of the beads with DNA or RNA template prepares the sample for PCR. The Biomeme two3\u2122 qPCR machine (Biomeme Inc. Philadelphia, PA, USA) is a small, light-weight, portable thermocycler that can be hand-held and displays output through a smart phone or laptop-based application [13]. All of the above steps are performed without the need for heat blocks, centrifuges, or cold storage, and the thermocycler can be run on battery or solar power.",

These samples were extracted using the Biomeme RNA M1 Sample Prep Kit\u2122. Samples (100 \u03bcL of a 1:10 vaccine dilution series, swab, hair or tissue) were placed in 1 mL of BLB (Biomeme lysis buffer) with 5 \u03bcL of carrier RNA (Qiagen Inc., CA, USA). Some samples were extracted with 1mL BLB plus 500 \u03bcL of molecular grade ethanol to try and enhance RNA viral recovery, however we did not find the addition of ethanol had any effect or improved viral recovery so was eliminated from this protocol early in the study. The samples were vigorously shaken by hand for one minute and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The entirety of the lysate was then drawn up into the Biomeme syringe through the extraction column and gently pumped up and down through the column 10 times, expelling, then discarding the liquid on the final pump. Next, 400 \u03bcL of BWB (Biomeme wash buffer) was drawn up into the column and expelled (1 pump). Then 800 uL of BPW (Biomeme protein wash) was drawn up in the column and expelled (1 pump). To eliminate excess fluid in the column, air was drawn up into the syringe and was then completely expelled by pumping residual fluid into a small waste container repeatedly approximately 10 times to dry the column. RNA was eluted from the column by drawing up 250 \u03bcL of BEB (Biomeme elution buffer) then pumping it up and down through the column three times.

The standard curve generated from the CDV positive control plasmid was also used to calculate the total CDV copy number in the RNA extracts from the vaccine control and clinical samples using the following equation solving for x (copy number): x = e((ABS(y-b)/(m)). Since we used 2 \u03bcL of template in each PCR reaction, we then divided the calculated copy number (x value) by 2 (copy number represented in 1 \u03bcL), and that number was then multiplied by the total RNA extract volume (amount of the final elution volume of each RNA extraction kit). Data was normalized in this manner to account for different elution volumes for each RNA extraction kit. This allowed normalization and comparison of total CDV viral copy recovery in the total RNA extract across platforms. The calculated copy numbers/sample from replicates were then averaged and graphed with standard deviations. PCR efficiency was calculated using the equation: e = (10(-1/slope)-1)*100). Two-tailed T-tests were used to determine significant differences between the Biomeme POC and standard laboratory platform performance.",

Given the challenges in clinically differentiating the two diseases, testing of hair samples could a valuable alternative approach that can decrease risk of human exposure to rabies when testing for CDV. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to verify that CDV virus is found in the skin and hair follicular epithelium/root bulb of infected animals, and as an additional internal positive control for our PCR results.",

Upon reviewing the Biomeme data from the positive Lutra lutra brain sample 2054, we observed an attenuated amplification curve in the positive result, amplifying and plateauing within 5 cycles. This sample was retested and confirmed to be negative by the Virology lab, and also negative using the Biomeme platform. Therefore we conclude that the initial test result was a false positive.

In addition, sensitivity (to 50 copies per PCR reaction) and efficiency (90\u2013110%) were consistent between platforms with positive control synthetic plasmid, and the latter was well within acceptable limits for traditional laboratory methods [21,24]. When compared across different tissue types from different species, and under different storage conditions (RNAlater\u2122, frozen), the Biomeme platform consistently detected CDV positive samples; however, the Ct values were generally higher than with traditional Qiagen RNA extracted samples. Several of the experiments with higher Ct values were conducted while examining only one variable, which allowed us to identify the Biomeme RNA extraction step as the likely cause for this difference in our tests. Further work is needed to determine if the reduction in viral detection is due to either reduced binding of all available RNA to the column or less efficient release of RNA off the column, and if any optimization can be done to improve recovery. We found that RNA extraction from swabs of tissue and whole tissue samples had a lower RNA recovery (0.5\u20132 logs lower) with the Biomeme methodology than with Qiagen extraction when normalized for total CDV viral RNA in the extract, though these results did not reach statistical significance. So, while overall CDV detection with both platforms was consistent, (26 of 26 after retest), the lower observed recovery of viral RNA with the Biomeme extraction methods, especially in samples with low viral load, has the potential to result in false negative results. Further testing with a variety of different viral titers will be beneficial in ascertaining how this kit performs in a variety of clinical CDV samples that contain low versus high viral loads. Nevertheless, given the portability of the platform, ease of use in the field, and consistent detection of CDV from known and suspect positive samples across tissue and sample types in our study, this platform is a useful point-of care testing tool for detecting CDV.",

IHC staining of CDV in the epidermal and follicular epithelial cells was consistent with the PCR results. Hair sample collection is easy, can be performed appropriately with minimal training, and can be opportunistically performed in live or dead animals making it a useful sample to collect from wildlife in the field or in a clinical setting. Non-invasive sampling reduces risk associated with handling sick or dead carnivores, especially those that could also be infected with rabies. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that can present with similar clinical neurological symptoms to CDV, and co-infection with both can occur [25]. There are currently no POC tests for rabies. However, a CDV negative POC test result from a non-invasively collected sample would serve to raise a higher suspicion of rabies or other neurologic disease processes for field personnel. In our testing, we found 100% concurrence in our results comparing the Biomeme and standard laboratory platforms. However, as mentioned above, higher Ct values were seen with the Biomeme platform (3.61 cycles, with a standard deviation of 2.01 cycles, n = 52 samples). When compared to other tissues types, the Ct differences across the hair samples were comparable, suggesting hair as a good, non-invasive sample for CDV POC testing. All raccoons tested in our study were found dead or euthanized after exhibiting clinical symptoms, so additional testing of hair samples comparing early, mid and late stage CDV infection will be especially valuable for determining if hair bulb is more or less valuable at certain stages of the disease.",

New developments for rapid, quantitative, reverse transcription, recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and isothermal polymerase gene amplification (RT-iiPCR) techniques for CDV detection have been recently described [26,27]. Field-capable equipment using these techniques is heavy (1.75 kg for a Genie III used in RT-RPA detection, and 2.1 kg for a POCKIT\u2122 iiPCR analyzer) and requires standard Qiagen commercial kits for RNA extraction. The latter require additional equipment and more reagents and time than the Biomeme M1 Sample Prep Kit\u2122, which can be used off-grid with solar power and without equipment such as centrifuges and heat blocks [14,15]. The entire Biomeme POC platform is lightweight and very portable, and all of the equipment and supplies are able to fit in a standard sized backpack. The two3\u2122 thermocycler plus case is 28 cm x 25.4 cm x 12.7 cm, and at 0.5 kg, making it is considerably lighter than the Genie III or POCKIT\u2122 iiPCR analyzer. In our experience, the Biomeme equipment is also easier to use than other platforms, and, like their extraction kit, the Biomeme thermocycler can be used in remote field settings that lack electricity. When lyophilized, the reagents (lyophilized Go-strips\u2122) are also shelf stable and do not require cold storage. Biomeme also offers an option to include inhibition control lyophilized Go-strips\u2122 in cases where PCR inhibition may be problematic. In our field-tests using the Biomeme two3\u2122 qPCR thermocycler, when fully charged, we have successfully performed up to five consecutive thermocycle runs on a single charge, and the unit is compatible with and able to be charged by a solar-charged battery such as the Goal 0\u2122 (Goal Zero, Bluffdale, UT) (Seimon and Brown, unpublished results).",

It is considered among the most widespread multi-host pathogens [31]. CDV is a recognized conservation threat to a number of endangered carnivores. Our understanding of CDV ecology, disease transmission and infection outcomes is far from complete and advancing our knowledge is critical for mitigating its effects in wildlife. For example, CDV has become a major conservation threat to endangered populations of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) and Far Eastern leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) in the Russia Far East [5,7,8]. This is in addition to the threats faced from poaching, habitat loss and tiger human conflict [32,33]. Serological, genetic and demographic studies in domestic dogs and mesocarnivores are needed to determine the role that wildlife and domestic dogs play for both maintaining CDV in the environment and as a source of infection for tigers [6,7]. Having a mechanism for rapid, effective, and field-friendly CDV diagnosis will improve conservation efforts to track disease spread and identify reservoir species, which will in turn lead to better methods for monitoring vulnerable populations and development of solutions to support the conservation of endangered carnivores in the wild. Additionally, adaptation of this platform to test for other pathogens will expand the utility of POC for health monitoring and disease surveillance in conservation, especially in remote, under-resourced regions, and can be a valuable tool in rescue and rehabilitation centers, shelters, and boarding facilities for wildlife and domestic animals as well.",
