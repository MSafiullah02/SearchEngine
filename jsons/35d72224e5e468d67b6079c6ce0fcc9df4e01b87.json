The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit only flu-like symptoms in the early stage. Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been asked by the public is \"Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?\". While different regions established their own criteria for screening to identify infected cases, the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands. On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the patients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best medical outcome.",

On December 31, 2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a case of novel viral pneumonia in Wuhan (Wong et al. 2020 ). Since the diagnosis of the first case, this virus has spread with astonishing speed and has caused many infections and a good number of deaths. The origin of the virus, however, remains unclear. An abrupt announcement was made on January 23, 2020 that the city of Wuhan was locked down to control the spread of the virus. Subsequently, almost all areas in China have begun to take serious public health measures to contain the virus (Xiao and Torok 2020).",

As COVID-19 has been found to be caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); certain epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported. However, comprehensive knowledge of COVID-19 still remains incomplete. For instance, the risk factors for mortality and the clinical course of the illness have not been well understood (Zhou et al. 2020 ). The early presentation of COVID-19 infection is typically nonspecific. Some infected cases may be asymptomatic, while many infected individuals often show flu-like symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever, or malaise in the first few days (Wong et al. 2020 ). The seeming-flu symptoms have created difficulties in differentiating COVID-19 from the common cold and seasonal influenza.",

Interestingly, the decreasing rate appears fairly stable regardless of the prevalence value, though those drop rates are not identical. For a given test, the false positive number is bigger for a population with a smaller prevalence, and the difference between two populations with different prevalence tends to be negligible, especially for those tests with a high specificity. In a population with 10,000 people, the false positive number can be as high as 6,000 if a test of the specificity around 40% is applied to everyone in the population; the false positive number can be lowered to about 1,000 if everyone in the population is tested with a procedure having a high specificity (such as 95%). Given that even for the best scenario the false positive number is still around 1,000 for a population of size 10,000, we conclude that it is not sensible to test everyone in the population for a disease without discretion (even if it is affordable in terms of availability of resources and the cost).

We may apply a fast but less accurate test kit to do screening, and then apply a more accurate but time-consuming and costly test to do further checks. If repeated tests need to be done, we need to decide the number of the tests in order to not miss the infected patients. In addition, in our discussion of repeating the test for COVID-19, we have not looked into the issue of the gap time between two consecutive tests.",

Diamond Princess was on a 14-day round trip itinerary, departing from Yokohama in Tokyo on January 20, 2020 and returning on February 4, 2020. There were 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew on board. Patient zero traveled for five days on Diamond Princess and disembarked in Hong Kong on January 25. During those five days, patient zero did not report being ill; he was tested positive for COVID-19 on February 1, six days after leaving the ship.On February 4, 10 people were tested positive for COVID-19 among the first batch of tested passengers. In subsequent days, more guests were tested positive. People with positive test results were transported to local hospitals for medical care.Table 1displays the number of people whose test results were positive on different days. Using the notation in Section 2, January 19 is taken at t = 0 on which N (0) = N h (0) = 3711 and N s (0) = 0; January 20 is taken as t = 1 on which N (1) = N (0) and N s (1) = 1; on February 4 (i.e., t = 17), N s (17) = 10 and N (17) = N (0) \u2212 10.

If we perceive that this cohort should have a higher prevalence than that of the general population in the Waterloo Region and assume Since no medical tests can produce 100% accurate results, both false negative and false positive results are possible when testing suspected patients. We are interested in whether repeating the test can help improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. In particular, we evaluate the chance that a tested subject is an infected case, given that the first (k \u2212 1) consecutive tests are negative but the kth test is positive, where k \u2265 1.

Similar cases have been reported in Japan and South Korea Researchers perceive that reinfection is an unlikely explanation for patients who test positive a second time. Testing errors and releasing patients from hospitals prematurely are very likely the reason for reports of patients who retest positive.

The accuracy of the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison(2020)is not precisely known. Based on the test performance in China and the performance of the influenza tests, the test is estimated to correctly identify around 60% of the patients with the disease and correctly identify 90% of the patients that are disease-free. The low sensitivity of the current tests for COVID -19 would yield a large number of false negative if we test everyone in a cohort with a low prevalence. That is, a large number of people having the virus would be misdiagnosed as healthy if we attempt to test the entire cohort which has not been carefully scrutinized for COVID-19.3. The tests should only be applied to presumptive people in order to control false positive and false negative results. With limited resources, targeting the presumptive people and applying the tests repeatedly is the best strategy to make sure the true COVID-19 carriers are not missed and discharged inpatients are truly virus-free.",

While the calculations show that the COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test outperforms the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020), we are not ready to recommend to replace the latter test by the former one. While the sensitivity and specificity of the COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test are higher than those of the COVID-19 test described byHutchison (2020), these results are obtained from different groups of patients whose conditions may differ considerably and the sizes may not be comparable either.Having fast and effective test tools is crucial for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 course while emerging research results offer new ways for testing COVID-19. For instance, investigating the temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT scans,Shi et al. (2020) found that a CT could be a useful tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia, even for asymp-tomatic individuals. Their findings suggested that CT scans can be considered as a screening tool together with RT-PCR for patients who traveled recently or have had close contact with an infected individual. Furthermore, CT scans may be an important screening tool in the small proportion of patients who have false-negative RT-PCR results (Lee, Ng and Khong 2020). Announced on March 21, 2020, diagnostics company Cepheid received emergency authorization from the U.S. FDA to use its rapid molecular test, SAR-CoV-2 Xpert Xpress, that can detect COVID-19 in 45 minutes for point-of-care patients(Scipioni 2020). A review of the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID-19 was given by Loeffelholz and Tang (2020).Our discussion here considers repetitions of the same test procedures. With multiple test kits becoming available, we face the decision of choosing suitable test kits to reach a balance among several key factors. This includes but not limited to the time of acquiring results, the associated cost, the test accuracy, and the suitability for patients with different",
