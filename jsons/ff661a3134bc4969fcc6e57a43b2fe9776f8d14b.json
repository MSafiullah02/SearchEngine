Indeed, the supervision of the adherence of clinical research to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and legal regulations is of the utmost importance. Yet, while such regulations have remained largely unchanged during recent years, the number of administrative tasks and their complexity have grown markedly, as supported by the results of a survey performed among 940 clinical investigators that we report in this manuscript. Therefore, many investigators believe that it has become necessary to undertake a rigorous analysis of the causes and consequences of this issue, and to create a conduit to channel the advice from experienced investigators regarding clinical research procedures, in order to improve them. Based on these premises, ESMO has launched the ESMO Clinical Research Observatory (ECRO), a task force that will analyse different aspects of clinical research. ECRO will aim to provide the views of ESMO on clinical research procedures based on the feedback from clinical investigators, under complete adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki, the GCP guidelines and any other applicable legal regulations, while at the same time showing profound respect for all the stakeholders involved in clinical research. This manuscript provides the background and rationale for the creation of ECRO, its planned activity and an analysis of the current administrative burden in clinical research with recommendations to rationalise it. Indeed, we expect that this effort shall lead to a relevant improvement in the care of patients and in the development of clinical research.",

[3] [4] [5] The number of processes that need to be documented and the complexity of the documenting procedures and templates have increased dramatically, creating an unsustainable pressure on the investigational site staff. Another layer of complexity has been added by the incorporation of cumbersome online platforms which require intricate procedures just to access them, and which generate myriads of emails that overwhelm the capacity of investigators and research teams. Exhaustive training courses for administrative processes, which frequently involve examinations, are imposed on clinical research teams to qualify as trial site staff. Frequently, such trainings are requested even from individuals that are not related to those specific administrative tasks. The administrative overload even affects the medical records of the patients, which are frequentlyand wrongly-considered as the most suitable place to document administrative procedures, thus distorting their true function. The number of meetings required during the development of trials has also increased relevantly, and once again, the focus of such meetings is often administrative.",

In addition, non-essential administrative procedures significantly increase the economic costs of clinical research and contribute to delays in trial implementation, 7 thus negatively impacting the flow of drug development and hampering patient access to new drugs. 8 This is particularly relevant in the setting of independent academic clinical research, 9 which is critical for patient-focused drug development. 10 More importantly, there is no evidence that this increased complexity leads to greater patient safety. A relevant example are pharmacovigilance procedures, which commonly consist of submitting all the available individual serious adverse events to investigators and documenting their reception, without any intent to summarise, prioritise or classify them. Sometimes, the events even include those observed during screening periods, when the patient has not yet received the investigational drug. This leads to an excess of information that becomes unmanageable and prevents investigators from being effectively updated on the safety of investigational drugs. Another example is the high number of informed consent versions generated in some studies and their complexity, which are difficult to understand by patients, 11 and may even generate distrust of the study and the research team.",

For example, some study protocols mandate discontinuation of the study treatments based on the strict application of response criteria, disregarding the medical judgement of the investigators in clinically complex situations (eg, the possibility of maintaining treatment in the case of persistent clinical benefit; or to radically treat oligometastatic progressive disease while maintaining systemic therapy). Frequently, in these situations, the strict interpretation of the protocol prevails, generating clinical interference with the best clinical judgement of the physician, who is responsible for the care of the patient; and potentially compromising the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants, in clear contrast with the main goals of the Declaration of Helsinki and the GCP guidelines.

Consequently, they should lead stakeholders to perform a profound analysis of the current situation and to implement the appropriate changes. ECRO will pursue the following areas of development, which are summarised in box 1: 1. Rationalisation of the bureaucratic burden associated with clinical research, based on strict adherence to current legal regulations and to any future amendments, and on showing respect to the time and expertise of clinical investigators and research teams, who should be mainly focused on clinical and research issues. Importantly, the ECRO will not enter into a debate on which administrative procedures are necessary and which are ancillary, but will rather support the following recommendations: a. Limiting the administrative documents required for trials to those required by GCP and legal regulations: We recommend that section 8 of the GCP guidelines ('Essential documents for the conduct of a clinical trial') is strictly followed, and that documents not included in that section are therefore considered non-essential. Of note, GCP guidelines only request that a small number of the essential documents be signed by the investigator; and they consider it \"acceptable to combine some of the documents, provided the individual elements are readily identifiable\" (GCP 8.1). b. Using simplified document templates: For example, while GCP guidelines merely-and reasonably-request that \"The investigator should maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has delegated significant trial-related duties\" (GCP 4.1.5), most study delegation logs have become extremely complex and labour-intensive to complete, and box 1 Initial areas of development and methods pursued by ECRO.",

Avoid redundant documentation: A relevant example is the documentation process of the informed consent process. While GCP clearly state that the \"informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed and dated informed consent form\" (GCP 1.28), 2 it has become routine practice to request that investigators duplicate this documentation in the medical records, frequently including administrative details, such as the version code of the document and so on. Such a process is redundant and lacks any value, since it is not signed by the patient, as required by GCP. d. Avoid complex electronic resources: Cumbersome applications with intricate access procedures should be replaced by user-friendly and intuitive systems, which should not require unnecessary trainings (ie, those dedicated to performing simple procedures, such as signing a document; or those dedicated to a resource that a particular member of the staff will not use). In addition, such resources should rely on single access platforms, rather than on multiple ones.",

Avoid repetitive and unnecessary meetings, and control their duration: Start-up and monitoring meetings should focus on the core aspects of protocols and on clinical issues, and should avoid reviewing general aspects, ancillary administrative procedures and so on. f. Optimise the delegation of trial procedures from investigators to other members of the research team: Indeed, the training and preparation of all the members of the research teams (ie, data managers, research nurses and so on) allows them to assume complex responsibilities. Therefore, optimising the delegation procedures will facilitate the development and monitoring of trials. 2. Avoid the clinical interference of protocols with best medical practice: Protocols describe the methodology that should be followed to conduct the trial, but they cannot foresee the whole variety of individual clinical situations that patients undergo and therefore they cannot substitute best medical practice. Consequently, protocols should avoid dictating strict and non-personalised instructions to manage clinically complex situations, such as discontinuation of an anticancer treatment whenever clinical benefit may persist, or when oligometastatic progressive disease may be controlled with radical treatment; or deny delivery of determined supportive therapy, such as palliative radiation. Protocols may consider such events as progression with regard to the interpretation of the study data, but treatment discontinuation should generally be decided by the investigators, after thorough discussion with their patients. Indeed, sponsors' recommendations regarding management of relevant toxicities, based on the centralised collection of information, should not be considered as clinical interference, particularly in the setting of early drug development. Neither should the decision to discontinue a study or a specific cohort of a study be considered as clinical interference. Nevertheless, the sponsor must inform investigators timely to avoid miscommunication with patients. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) should specifically examine the existence of clinical interference in new protocols and should carefully review any potential situation of clinical interference in ongoing protocols, requesting appropriate amendments, as required by GCP guidelines (GCP 4.5.4). 3. Pharmacovigilance administrative procedures: Reporting the safety of medicines in the routine and clinical research settings is essential to maintain physicians updated about adverse events, with the objective of improving patient safety. In order to increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of the process, ECRO believes that current logistical and administrative pharmacovigilance procedures for reporting events from the sponsor to the investigators should be thoroughly revised and simplified. While the development of the optimal process is beyond the scope of this manuscript, and should be defined through the collaboration and consensus of all stakeholders, we believe that the current practice of unstructured submission of all reports on individual serious adverse events to investigators is difficult to manage and may even dilute the desired effect of proper safety information. Adequate procedures, such as interpreting and periodically summarising the available information, should be evaluated. ECRO will employ the following methods to attain its objectives (box 12 ; the occurrence and causes of excessive delays in starting treatment in cancer patients due to centralised molecular testing [13] [14] [15] ; the broadening of eligibility inclusion criteria in clinical trials, to avoid disparities in care [16] [17] [18] ; the consequences of outsourcing the monitoring of trials 7 ; the need to simplify informed consents 11 and so on. 3. Issue recommendations regarding relevant topics related to clinical research. Importantly, ECRO will not evaluate specific cases, given the regional differences in legislations and patient management; and since decisions must depend on the structures that are legally in place in each country (eg, IRBs and other ethics committees). ECRO may contact local scientific societies to seek their advice about specific regional issues. 4. Foster the involvement of experienced clinical investigators in the training of study monitors, to provide them with the clinical perspective of clinical research. 5. Collaborate with other national and international associations related to clinical research, especially those in the area of Oncology, in order to endorse, revise and improve this initiative.",

Indeed, we expect that all the stakeholders involved in clinical research will recognise the need to critically analyse these relevant problems and to assume their responsibility in implementing the necessary changes to overcome them. Consequently, rather than attempting to audit and to control clinical trial procedures, ECRO will publicly acknowledge the merits of those entities (ie, CROs, sponsors, IRBs, clinical research teams, regulatory authorities and so on) who succeed in reviewing and simplifying procedures without compromising-or even improving-the quality of clinical research, and consequently, the well-being of patients.",
