Although the prevalence and clinical manifestations of the two subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B, have been studied in some detail in infants and young children, they have not been determined in adults. To evaluate the prevalence of the RSV subtypes and disease severity between RSV-A and RSV-B infections in adults, nasal and throat swabs that were collected from patients !15 years old who sought medical care for acute respiratory infections at the Fever Clinic of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China between May 2005 and April 2010. The samples were tested for RSV infection using PCR and sequencing analysis. RSV was detected in 95 (1%) of the adult patients, of whom 53 (55.8%) were positive for RSV-A and 42 (44.2%) for RSV-B. The incidence of RSV infections increased with age (x 2 \u00bc 37.17, P \u00bc 1.66E\u00c007). Demographic data and clinical manifestations of RSV-A were similar to those of RSV-B. Although RSV-A and RSV-B co-circulated during the 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 seasons, RSV-A was predominant in the 2006-2008 seasons, whereas RSV-B was predominant in the 2009-2010 season.",

The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Clinical specimens were collected from patients with acute respiratory infection when they first sought medical care (prior to their being admitted to a specific unit of the hospital) at the Fever Clinic of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, a large comprehensive hospital for medical treatment, teaching, and scientific research in Beijing. According to the regulations for management of acute respiratory infection in China, all patients with acute fever must be screened at a Fever Clinic before being received by a specific medical department in a hospital. A total white-blood cell count less than 10 \u00c2 10 9 /L may suggest the presence of viral infections [Ruuskanen et al., 2011] . Thus, to exclude typical bacterial infections and include potential viral infections, patients !15 years old were included in this study if they presented with: (1) acute fever (body temperature !388C); (2) white-blood cell count 10 \u00c2 10 9 /L; and (3) respiratory symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. On average, about 22 patients met these criteria each day during the study period. Every day during the study period, physicians blindly collected specimens from 5 to 10 patients meeting the enrollment criteria, without considering age, sex, ethnicity, and other symptoms. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from each patient, and both swabs were pooled in one tube containing virus transport medium (VTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy). Sampling was performed every day from May 2005 to April 2010, except in July and November 2005. The samples were stored at \u00c0808C prior to being analyzed.",

            "text": "Here, the prevalence of RSV infections was investigated in adult patients with acute respiratory . This is the first study that characterizes the incidence of RSV subgroups in Chinese adults with fever and respiratory illness. The results of this study indicate that RSV-A accounts for more cases of RSV infection (55.8%) than RSV-B (44.2%) in the study population. The ratio of RSV-A in this study is lower than that reported in Chinese children, in whom RSV-A accounts for 73.7% of the RSV infections in Beijing [Deng et al., 2006 ] and for 79.5% of the RSV infections in Chongqing [Zhang et al., 2010] . Two factors may account for this disparity: (1) the subjects recruited in this study were adult outpatients, whereas those in other studies were mainly hospitalized children [Deng et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010] ; and (2) samples were collected during different time periods. Zhang et al. [2010] This study also showed that the fluctuating prevalence patterns of the RSV subgroups in the study population are similar to the patterns observed in children worldwide [Coggins et al., 1998; Scott et al., 2004; Arbiza et al., 2005; Sato et al., 2005; Zlateva et al., 2007; Shobugawa et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010] . In this study, RSV-A and RSV-B co-circulated during the -2006 and 2008 seasons. RSV-A was predominant in the 2006 -2008 seasons, whereas RSV-B was predominant in the 2009-2010 season. Additionally, RSV infection appeared with an alternating high and low biennial rhythm in the study population. Similar rhythms have been observed in children from Beijing, China [Deng et al., 2006] and Chile [Avenda\u00f1 o et al., 2003] . The dominance of RSV-A and RSV-B has also been reported to alternate biennially in Japan [Sato et al., 2005] . A pattern in which RSV-A predominated for 2 years and RSV-B predominated for 1 year was reported in Chongqing, China [Zhang et al., 2010] , Belgium [Zlateva et al., 2007] , the United States [Coggins et al., 1998] , and Kenya [Scott et al., 2004] . In Uruguay, two to four consecutive years of RSV-A predominance were followed by 1 year of RSV-B predominance [Arbiza et al., 2005] . Similarly, RSV-B predominance for 1 year was followed by 4 years of RSV-A predominance in Japan [Shobugawa et al., 2009] . Reports on differing virulence between RSV-A and RSV-B are controversial [van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk and Watkiss, 2012] . It has been shown that RSV-A is more likely than RSV-B to cause severe disease in hospitalized infants in two previous studies [McConnochie et al., 1990; Walsh et al., 1997 ]. In contrast, this study indicates that the clinical manifestations of RSV-A and RSV-B are very similar in Chinese adults with fever and respiratory illness. All of the RSV-positive patients identified in this study had mild acute respiratory infections. The disparity may be attributed to the subjects recruited. Hospitalized infants, who had severe respiratory infection even requiring mechanical ventilation, were recruited in the two previous studies [McConnochie et al., 1990; Walsh et al., 1997] , whereas only adult outpatients with fever and acute respiratory illness were investigated in this study.",

The use of multiplex PCR rather than singleplex PCR to detect RSV in adults may not be optimal, as viral titers are considerably lower in adults than in infants. Limitations in the study population should also be considered. Because the outpatients could not be traced, patients who deteriorated due to worsening RSV infections may have been missed in the study, possibly resulting in an underestimate of disease severity. Additionally, due to the small number of RSV-positive patients in this study, a larger cohort of patients is needed to characterize the clinical manifestations of infections by each RSV subgroup. Although these points might be worth noting, they do not detract from the overall conclusions of this study.",
