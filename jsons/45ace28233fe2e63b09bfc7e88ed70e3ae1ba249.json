The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic presents a new challenge for neurologists treating persons with MS (pwMS) (Brownlee et al., 2020) . At the time of writing, over 3.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases (243,401 fatal) have been reported worldwide (World Health Organization, Situation Report 106, 2020). This has triggered the release of various and diverse guidelines on the use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS during the pandemic. However, there are no unified, evidence-based recommendations. A better understanding of COVID-19, its implications for pwMS, and the effects of DMTs in the context of this novel disease are only just beginning to emerge, and evidence is scarce (Novi et al., 2020; Sormani MP et al., 2020) . The pilot phase of an Italian MS COVID-19 registry reported a mild disease course of COVID-19 (defined as no pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in the majority (223/232; 96%) of patients, largely receiving DMTs.",
