Healthcare facilities have implemented proactive steps to reduce COVID-19 transmission such as visitor restrictions, eliminating group activities and communal dining, and PPE use for staff (1, 2) . Due to the apparent idiosyncrasies of COVID-19 (e.g., high contagiousness in asymptomatic people, atypical presentations in some older adults, high falsenegative testing rate) front-end preventative measures may be insufficient in curtailing spread of the virus (1). Beyond intra-facility spread, there is concern for inter-facility spread with some staff working at multiple care facilities (3).",

Without commensurate efforts to support frontline staff, any expansion of front-end resources will simply add water to a leaky bucket that cannot hold. This is not to diminish efforts to expand and sustain the larger workforce but to highlight an essential link on which the vulnerable older adult population desperately relies and that may be insufficiently addressed in current policy discussions. Recommendations have been made for increasing the supply of PPE and testing materials in the long-term care nursing environment, increasing the preparedness of post-acute care settings, and providing paid sick leave for all staff (1, 2) . Beyond short-term benefit support, however, a comprehensive approach is needed to provide stability for frontline staff.",

To bolster frontline personnel and maintain adequate staffing ratios, there need to be avenues to bring new people into the workforce and train them quickly and effectively. Options include reassigning workers within an institution whose jobs have been affected by COVID-19, bringing in people from industries that have suffered higher numbers of layoffs (2) , and expediting international recruitment and the process of obtaining work permits and visas (4) . To sustainably protect the health of older adult populations, a multipronged approach is needed that provides opportunities to implement best practices and also security and support for all members of the workforce, particularly the most vulnerable members of the frontline staff.",
