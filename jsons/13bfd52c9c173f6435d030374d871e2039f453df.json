A similar step forward in the area of nucleic acids was made by Parkinson et al. (1996) . However, these efforts have no counterpart for so-called 'hetero' compounds. As a result, the structures of small molecules found in complexes with biomacromolecules are often less reliable than those of the surrounding amino acids and nucleic acid bases. The reason is most probably the essentially boundless structural diversity of small molecules as opposed to the limited numbers of building blocks of proteins and nucleic acids (Kleywegt et al., 2003) . These small molecules are physiological ligands, cofactors, lead compounds, substrate analogs etc. and the accuracy of their structures can be of crucial importance for interpreting their (potential) biological roles.",

Common to all these is the use of parameters with a predefined set of atom classes originating from various force fields and the use of selections of published values of bond distances and angle values. The program Hess2FF is an attempt to construct restraints on a purely theoretical basis (Nilsson et al., 2003) , whereas eLBOW, part of PHENIX (Adams et al., 2002) , is a kind of amphibian that uses combined empirical and theoretical approaches.",

Averaged values for each parameter analyzed were defined as the target values and standard deviations were used to define the force-constant values. In this way, the expected variation in the parameters determined the force constants rather than the physical force (Engh & Huber, 1991) .",

Only 12% of the hetero structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., 2000) have an exact match in the CSD (R. Taylor, personal communication). Therefore, it is important to generate a parameter set that will provide parameters for existing and emerging compounds with an accuracy and precision approaching those of the Engh-Huber and Parkinson parameter sets. Since such a parameter set has to cover the vast diversity of existing and emerging chemical space, it must be able to extend over thousands of atom classes and parameters connecting them. It is clear that such a set can only be reliably constructed, maintained and updated in an automated manner. With these goals in mind, the PURY database was constructed as an automatically generated library of geometric parameters for the refinement and validation of hetero compounds based on high-resolution crystal structures. PURY parameters can be used for the refinement and validation of the geometry of not only hetero compounds but also amino-acid and nucleic acid residues and whatever else comes its way. Here, we describe the current features, accuracy, limitations and an outline of the development of PURY. The accompanying server makes the database available to the crystallographic community.",

Only a tiny proportion of the parameters (2.2% of bonds, 0.7% of angles and 0.4% of impropers) are really accurately described and even then there are a few exceptions, as shown below. In general, the parameters extracted from more than 30 representatives appear to be statistically reliable (at 5% reliability), which corresponds roughly to 15% of all parameters (21.8% of bonds, 12.6% of angles and 7.1% of impropers). A substantial number of the entries are the result of a single observation (6.9% of bonds, 21% of angles and 36.9% of impropers). This table suggests that the standard deviation and the target value of a substantial number of terms are not reliable and their values were therefore adjusted to reasonable values. Fig. 3 illustrates the connection between accuracy, precision and number of repetitions.

The precision of the terms is reflected in their values, which are 0.0147, 0.032 and 0.031 \u00c5 for the first, second and third case, respectively. The shape of the first histogram gives the impression of a highly accurate term. For the histogram of the third term it is obvious that the term is underrepresented, although its minimum and maximum bond lengths are closer than those of the other two terms; even the standard deviation is sharp, suggesting that its precision may not differ much from that of the middle term. This is a warning that indicates a more general phenomenon. Transfer of geometric restraints from similar fragments to unknown structures in the absence of the corresponding experimental structure or statistical validation of the term may be less reliable than anticipated. Only 12% of hetero compounds have a matching structural deposit in the CSD (R. Taylor, personal communication). The cases presented in Fig. 4 illustrate the behaviour for bonding, dihedral and improper angles. The bond angle of an amide fragment ('CH1X-C__Y-NH1Y'; Fig. 4a ) involved in a peptide bond has a clearly defined maximum peak which corresponds to the average value of 116.3 and a smaller peak positioned the other side of 120 . The double peak of the bonding angle is reminiscent of proline-residue analysis, for which coupling has been observed between the bonding and dihedral angles (Lamzin et al., 1995; Engh & Huber, 2001) ; however, the population of the lower peak is too low to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. The amide-fragment dihedral (CH1X-NH1Y-C__Y-O2C) has the major peak at 0 and a much less populated peak at 180 (Fig. 4c) , an indication of the appearance of trans and cis amide (peptide) bond conformations. The freely rotatable bond around the two sp 3 -hybridized C atoms, dihedral CH1X-CH1X-CH1X-CH1X (Fig. 4d) , exhibits a distinct peak at 0 in addition to a period of 3, indicating the presence of the cis conformation. The absence of peaks at AE120 suggests that a period of 6 is not justified, whereas the absence of any width of the 0 peak is indicative of the use of constraints during structure refinement. This case illustrates that dihedral angle terms describing conformations of freely rotatable single bonds may not be represented well by the ideal value. Alternatively, one may use an all-atom model with all H atoms included or not use any specific term for such dihedral angles (the energy barrier is set to 0) and use the 1-4 nonbonding interaction terms instead (as in the X-PLOR TOP_19 parameter set). PURY can deliver restraints for both types of restraint.",

(It needs to be emphasized, however, that the histograms of data for improper restraints are symmetric as a consequence of the way they are sampled.) Histograms of selected parameters. (a) A peptide-bond angle including C atom 'CH1X', an sp 2 -hybridized planar C atom 'C__Y' and an sp 2 -hybridized planar N atom with one bonded H atom 'NH1Y'. (b) A tyrosine-or phenylalanine-like improper angle around an sp 2 -hybridized C atom in a sixmembered aromatic ring 'CC_6' including a C atom 'CH2X' and two sp 2 -hybridized C atoms in a six-membered aromatic ring with bonded H atoms 'CH_6'. (c) A dihedral angle through a planar peptide bond having only a single peak 'CH1X-NH1Y-C__Y-O2C_'. (d) A dihedral including four sp 3hybridized C atoms with a freely rotatable single middle bond which has many energy minima 'CH1X-CH1X-CH1X-CH1X'. Fig. 5 shows the distributions of bond lengths of an H atom bound to an O atom (hydroxyl group), to a phenyl ring carbon, to an amide and to an aliphatic ring carbon. The presence of several high narrow peaks on the background of an extremely broad distribution of bond lengths ranging from 0.7 \u00c5 with several outliers even beyond 1.3 \u00c5 in all four cases demonstrates that the positioning of H atoms is ambiguous. The CSD does not provide experimental data to verify in which cases the positioning and refinement of H-atom positions is supported by diffraction data; the CSD filters do not allow us to analyze the reliability of the structures to the resolution at which they were determined. However, they do allow structures to be chosen according to the radiation source. Fig. 6 shows the equivalent bond lengths of structures determined only by neutron diffraction. There were 920 such deposits in the analyzed release, which contained 33 339 atoms and 66 540 covalent bonds. In a total of 1692 bond-length parameters from the neutron data, there are 121 cases of bonds with H atoms. In contrast to the whole set of CSD structures analyzed, the most populated bond length of H atoms from neutron structures only exhibits a single peak. The positions of these peaks are marked on the corresponding figures derived from the complete CSD (Fig. 5) Table 3 Bond lengths of H atoms from neutron-derived structures.",

However, these peaks are much more highly populated than those obtained by analysis of the structures determined by neutron diffraction only. This reveals that only a small fraction of the H-atom bond lengths of structures determined using X-rays are consistent with those determined using neutrons. Hence, most hydrogen-bond lengths present in the CSD are the consequence of the use of preset values during refinement and these presets differ from the real values obtained by neutron diffraction. In general they are 0.1 \u00c5 too short (Table 3) . Also, the distribution of bond lengths is substantially narrower for the neutron data, as seen from column 4. Unfortunately, the terms from the neutron diffraction data do not make it possible to replace most of the X-ray-derived terms for hydrogen-bond lengths, so the current state of the art of PURY takes into account all experimental data but includes cases from Table 3 which are represented by over 100 repetitions.

The average values for bond and angle terms show that on broadening the pool of analyzed data the values of bonds and angles also broaden (Table 5) . This is true for the three PURY portions, as well as when comparing the variability of EH parameters with those of the hetero compounds with and without metals. From Table 5 it is also evident that the PURY deviations for amino acids are higher than those of EH; however, they are still within acceptable limits, as suggested by Jaskolski et al. (2007) , who recently analyzed PDB and CSD data for the use of geometric restraints in refinement of macromolecules. However, the deviations of PURY parameters are lower than those obtained by analyzing hetero compounds in the PDB: 0.043 \u00c5 and 2.59 for PURY versus 0.073 \u00c5 and 5.96 from the PDB for nonmetal hetero compounds, and 0.064 \u00c5 and 5.66 versus 0.091 \u00c5 and 6.36 for all hetero compounds.

We have therefore compared the consistency of the PURY parameters with the EH parameters. We have chosen four macromolecular crystal structures, three from the laboratory and one external structure, with different resolution ranges and refined them against EH and PURY targets. Each structure was refined using the same starting coordinates, the same target (bond r.m.s.d. = 0.01 \u00c5 to enlarge the impact of the tight geometric restraints) and the same computational tools and protocols. As seen in Table 6 , the deviations from the bond target values are almost identical in all four cases. They differ by \u00c00.0001, 0.0005, 0.0001 and 0.0036 \u00c5 , indicating that the structures have indeed been refined equivalently. Also, the r.m.s.d.s of angle deviations against the targets used in refinement are very similar, 0.077 , \u00c00.044 and 0.021 , although in the fourth case the difference is slightly higher at 0.185 . The cross-validation, in which structures refined against PURY targets were validated against the EH parameter set, showed a slight increase of bond r.m.s.d.s (0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003 \u00c5 ) as well as angle r.m.s.d.s (0.007 , 0.054 , 0.01 ; in the fourth case it fell) and the reverse cross-validation is in general slightly higher. Comparison of the crystallographic R values revealed small differences (0.1, 0.03, 0.2 and 0.8%) in favour of the EH parameter set. The conclusion is nevertheless clear; the PURY parameter set performs essentially equivalently to the EH parameter set, suggesting that the use of PURY parameters in the refinement of hetero compounds will behave equivalently to the expert-derived data set(s).",

As previously noted (Engh & Huber, 2001) , the proline CB-CG bond with an average length of 1.492 \u00c5 has a large value ( = 0.05 \u00c5 ).

The bond-length assignment is actually a problem of the concept of atom-class assignment based on chemical environment, which cannot differentiate between geometric arrangements such as cis and trans peptide bonds.

The parameters for the angles CB-CG-SD and CG-SD-CE are also similar. Interestingly, however, the PURY force constants are evidently higher than those for EH for all terms except the CG-SD-CE angle, where they are approximately equal. The bond and angle histograms involving methionine parameters are shown in Figs. 11(c), 11(d), 11(e) and 11(f). Owing to the larger number of structures used in the PURY analysis (when compared with the presumably smaller number used to derive EH targets), we suggest modifying the geometric restraints (in particular forces) for the methionine residue. In addition, PURY parameters for the restraint of selenomethionine residues are provided in Table 8 . 4.4.5. Histidine. The PURY and EH parameter sets differ most in the histidine-residue terms. Both atom-class assignments differentiate between protonated and nonprotonated ND1 and NE2 atoms; however, PURY atom-class assignment does not differentiate between CD2 and CE1 atoms, which are both recognized as 'CH_5' (C atom within a five-membered planar ring with a bonded H atom). As a consequence, four different bonding targets of the EH set merge into one PURY target which lies somewhere in the middle. The situation is similar with the bond length of nonprotonated histidines, which merge into a single PURY target value. The longer and shorter bonding distances are an indication of single-bond and double-bond character of the ring bonds and cannot be appropriately elaborated with the current PURY concept (Figs. 11g, 11h, 11i and 11j) . Namely, only a single target value can be derived for bonds between two atom classes, yet the bonds between two atom classes can be single or double. For example, in a putative case in which sp 2 hybridized atoms are bonded to each other in a chain, single and double bonds alternate, yet they are both bonds between the same atom classes. Clearly, the chance of such a case occurring within a small set is rather small; however, when a large pool of data such as the CSD has been analyzed, the occurrence of such cases is not that uncommon.",

Firstly, is the current atom-class assignment scheme indeed recognizing all appropriate atom classes (which important issues have we missed)? Secondly, how reliable are the data presented in the CSD? We hope that the use of PURY and the imminent validation of all structures deposited in the CSD against the PURY database will expose further potential misassignments, while the use of PURY for the validation of small-molecule structures may draw more attention to details of the structures such as charged states and protonation and thereby increase the reliability of the data being deposited. Unfortunately, the lack of structure factors prevents the remediation of structures already in the CSD. Perhaps it is time to change the policy to require deposition of these data for all published structures in all journals and make them publicly available too.",
