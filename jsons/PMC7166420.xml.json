Additionally, recent studies suggest that rhinoviruses also play a major role as a cause of respiratory tract infections leading to hospitalization within this group, however these studies varied in their study populations, severity of cases, age, and comorbidities [Kellner et al., 1989; Juven et al., 2000; Kusel et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2007; Bonzel et al., 2008; Franz et al., 2010; Iwane et al., 2011]. Clinical signs and symptoms of HMPV infection overlap with those of RSV and rhinovirus infections and reliable clinical distinction is not possible. Some reports have tried to correlate laboratory parameters such as specimen viral load with disease severity [Bosis et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2008; Houben et al., 2010].",

A previous study found [Franz et al., 2010] that the median age of children with rhinovirus infections was 1.4 years in contrast to children with RSV infections (median 0.5 years). This finding has been confirmed by others [Korppi et al., 2004]. Since the clinical manifestation and the disease severity depend substantially on the age, a direct comparison of the clinical course of HMPV, RSV, and RV infection is made more difficult by the different average age at presentation.",

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected on the day of admission. Out of this collective three groups each encompassing 30 individuals with either HMPV, RSV or RV infection were defined. There were only minor differences in the age distribution as measured by both, the mean age and the range. This was done because in children in the second year of life HMPV, RSV, and RV are frequently found in contrast to very young children who are mostly infected and hospitalized by RSV. These older children are thought to be beyond the period of maternal immunity. Each patient was included only once and no patient was included if more than one viral pathogen was detected.",

Quantitation for HMPV\u2010, RSV\u2010, and Rhinovirus\u2010genomes was performed using known concentrations of plasmids containing the target regions of the viruses. A standard graph of the CT values obtained from serial dilutions of the standard was constructed by the software, the CT values of the unknown samples were plotted on the standard curves and the number of genomes was calculated. Quantitation of Interleukin\u20108 (IL\u20108) was performed using a purified anti\u2010cytokine capture antibody (Cat.

            "text": "In young children the clinical picture of most respiratory infections tends to be more severe, but a straightforward correlation between clinical presentation and the causing respiratory pathogen is absent. Therefore, in the present study hospitalized children with RSV, HMPV, or RV infections and comparable age distribution were compared to minimize the effects of age on the clinical manifestation. It was found that rhinovirus infections could not be differentiated clearly by clinical signs and laboratory parameters on admission from HMPV and RSV infections. The frequency of severe respiratory tract infection was similar between the three groups however some differences could be found regarding the course of illness. Several recent studies compared the clinical signs and the severity mainly between HMPV and RSV with conflicting results. Most studies have found no clear difference [Mullins et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2006], however some reports describe more severe infections in patients with HMPV or RSV [von Linstow et al., 2004; Wilkesmann et al., 2006]. This could be due to different study populations and an age\u2010related frequency of severe manifestations. The third group of the present study, the rhinovirus\u2010infected children showed clinical courses with significantly lower body temperature and a non\u2010significant shorter length of stay in hospital. This slightly milder course could be predicted neither by regarding the standard laboratory parameters at admission nor by the more sophisticated determination of the viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. The finding of higher leucocyte counts in RV\u2010infected patients as compared to HMPV\u2010 and RSV\u2010infections is in agreement with previous studies [Franz et al., 2010] and might be due to an immune suppressive effect of the latter.",

            "text": "The most significant difference in laboratory parameters was seen with nasopharyngeal IL\u20108 concentrations, which was significantly lower in patients with rhinovirus infections. IL\u20108 also known as neutrophil chemotactic factor, is a member of the CXC chemokine family and induces chemotaxis in neutrophils and other granulocytes, causing them to migrate towards the site of infection and initiate phagocytosis [Baggiolini and Clark\u2010Lewis, 1992; Baggiolini et al., 1994; Baggiolini et al., 1995]. IL\u2010 8 is often associated with localized inflammation and has been described as a proinflammatory mediator [Vlahopoulos et al., 1999]. There are conflicting results in the literature concerning the correlation of cytokine concentrations in the respiratory specimens and the underlying virus. The role of acute phase cytokines (IL1\u03b2, IL\u20106, TNF\u03b1) in the nasopharynx during upper respiratory infections with influenza virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus in children were also investigated by others [Patel et al., 2009]. They found significantly higher IL\u20106 concentration during adeno virus and influenza virus infections as compared to rhinoviruses and generally in children with systemic febrile response during upper respiratory infection. In contrast, others compared RSV lower respiratory tract infections with rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection and determined a variety of cytokines and chemokines and could only find a significant difference for IL\u201015 but not for IL\u20106 or IL\u20108 [Garcia et al., 2012]. However, the latter study enrolled less than 20 children in each study group younger than 2 years. The former studies are in agreement with the data presented here showing lower concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL\u20108 in children with rhinovirus infections as compared to HMPV\u2010 and RSV\u2010infections and a tendency to lower body temperature. The lower concentrations of the chemotactic factor IL\u20108 in the nasopharyngeal aspirates contrasts to the higher leucocyte counts in the blood of the rhinovirus infected children underlining that local and systemic immune responses might show different patterns. Increased or prolonged inflammatory responses have been discussed as a reason for a higher disease burden [Turner et al., 1998; Gern et al., 2000; Gern et al., 2002]. Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated if a shorter hospital stay in children with rhinovirus infections indeed correlates with lower concentrations of IL\u20108 in the nasopharynx.",

This is supported by a former prospective study [Franz et al., 2010] where significant differences between these two parameters could be found. Finally, a control group of healthy children was not enrolled, unfortunately a common fault in many studies of pediatric patients. Taken together the present data lead to the conclusion that a reliable identification of a HMPV, RSV, or RV infection can only be made by a molecular techniques such as qualitative real time PCR. In contrast quantitation of virus was, in this context, not useful for the assessment of the severity or duration of the disease. Where HMPV\u2010 and RSV\u2010infections were quite similar in their clinical course, rhinovirus infections seem to have a tendency to faster recuperation in young children.",
