These changes make the partial pressure of oxygen slightly higher than normal on a blood gas, and would range from 100 to 110 mmHg. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide would be lower than normal for a nonpregnant patient and ranges from 27 to 32 mmHg [3] . Low pulmonary reserves that arise from reductions in functional residual capacity and increased oxygen consumption make pregnant women develop hypoxemia more rapidly [4] .",

Once pulmonary edema occurs, parenteral therapy is more effective, and nitroglycerine is the agent of choice as recommended by The European Society of Cardiology [8] . Diuretics should be instituted to promote pre load reduction recognizing that the preeclamptic patient may have complex fluid balance needs due to low oncotic pressure.

Certain factors easily obtained by a good history can help you understand who is at increased risk of complications from asthma, these being history of exacerbations, intubations, and recent steroid use. Most exacerbations are characterized by cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. The National Asthma Education and Prevention (NAEP) group recommends obtaining a baseline peak expiratory flow in order to guide further management. If the patient is approaching less than half of what their baseline is, then treatment with supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia and bronchodilators such as a beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents are to be given. A target oxygen saturation above 90 % with consideration for invasive mechanical ventilation in those who are in impending respiratory failure. A partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the normal range of 36-40 on an arterial blood gas can be a early sign of imment respiratory failure in the gravid patient. Intravenous steroids also have to be instituted. Care should be taken during mechanical ventilation to avoid a short expiratory time that can cause auto peep [16] . Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in acute severe asthma in addition to bronchodilators especially in patients with coexistent hypertension or preterm uterine contractions [16, 17] .",
