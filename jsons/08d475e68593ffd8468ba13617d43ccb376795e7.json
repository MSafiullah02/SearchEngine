            "text": "Studies on Covid-19 disease that appeared in December 2019 are limited. Many of these limited studies are for the recognition of the Covid-19 virus [13, 14] . Also, some studies have been conducted on the effects of this disease on humans [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . At the same time, the treatment of the Coronavirus and the processes occurring after it have been examined by Zhang et al. In the study, the possible conditions of the patient who was treated on Covid-19 disease and discharged were examined [2] . Covid-19 was examined in terms of dermatologists by Darlenski and Tsankov. They presented the effects of extreme hygiene measures on the skin and the factors that dermatologists will consider in this regard [20] . Chen et al. focused on the prevent that can be taken for the Covid-19 virus and the success of a new type of treatment. The effect of mesenchymal stem cell therapy on the Covid-19 virus was interpreted with this study, and it was emphasized that it would be an alternative for treatment [21] . Holland et al. presented the kit developed by emergency doctors to protect against the Covid-19 virus [22] . On the other hand, Yang et al. examined the possible effects of the Covid-19 virus on children and their future [23] . The study emphasized the importance of protection prevent in children with other chronic conditions, and it was also emphasized that newborns should be isolated. Lai et al. presented symptoms of coronavirus and pneumonia in their studies. In this study, it was found that it was mostly infected in adult patients. Ways to protect against this virus are presented [9] . Li et al. investigated the genetic evolution and source of the Covid-19 virus [24] . These studies are currently limited in the literature and are expected to increase rapidly since the Covid-19 virus has just been introduced and the available data are not sufficient. However, symptoms of Covid-19 disease are similar to those of pneumonia, and a certain percentage of deaths due to the Covid-19 virus are on Pneumonia disease. There are many studies on the classification of Pneumonia disease with intelligent systems in the literature. Togacar et al. [25] have presented an intelligent classification system for Pneumonia disease. Chest radiographs were used for this study. In this study, deep learning methods were used and the results were presented by using AlexNet, VGG-16, and VGG-19 neural network models. The accuracy values for the selected dataset have resulted in 99.41%. Sousa et al. [26] provided automatic pneumonia diagnosis in infants through computer-aided systems from radiographic images. In this system, pneumonia data is classified using three classifiers. The classifiers used are Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor and Na\u00efve Bayes. In this study, it was determined that the most suitable classifier for the available data is Support Vector Machines. Pneumonia disease was identified and classified by chest x-ray images by Jaiswal et al. [27] . In this study, deep convolutional neural network method was used. The main purpose of using this method is to provide an effective acquisition of local and global features of chest X-ray images. In this study, NIH CXR14 [28] dataset was used. In the study, the evaluation parameter mean threshold value and mean score was selected. Liang and Zheng [29] have developed a smart system for child Pneumonia disease. The convolutional neural network method was used in the developed system and the performance of Kermany [30] dataset was used. In this study, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC were used as evaluation criteria. The accuracy value was calculated as 90.5% in the proposed method. Sirazitdinov et al. interpreted chest x-ray images with machine learning techniques. RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset [31] was used in the study. In the study, precision, recall, F1-score were used to evaluate the results.",

ResExLBP divides input image into 128 \u00c2 128 sized exemplars and LBP extracts feature from the input image and exemplars of it. The generated features are concatenated and discriminative ones of them are selected by using IRF.

ReliefF is one of the most preferred distance based feature selector. It is a parametric feature selector. To automated feature selection, we presented a novel iterative ReliefF based feature selector (IRF). To obtain general performance, LOOCV and 10-fold CV are used in this work. Five classifiers were also selected to show the general success of the proposed ResExLBP and IRF based method.
