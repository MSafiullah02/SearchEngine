During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, some dialysis patients in three centers who were incidentally exposed to patients or medical staff with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated to interrupt the spread of the infection. We aimed to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms and risk factors among these patients. Materials and methods: In total, 116 hemodialysis (HD) patients in contact with MERS-CoV-confirmed subjects were isolated using three strategies, namely, single room isolation, cohort isolation, and self-quarantine. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean (IES-R-K) to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms at 12 months after the isolation period. Results: Of the 116 HD patients, 27 were lost to follow-up. Of the 89 patients, 67 (75.3%) completed the questionnaires. Single room isolation was used on 40 (58.8%) of the patients, cohort isolation on 20 (29.4%), and self-imposed quarantine on 8 (11.8%). In total, 17.9% of participants (n = 12) reported post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the IES-R-K's cutoff point (\u226718). Prevalence rates of IES-R-K \u226718 did not differ significantly according to isolation method. However, isolation duration was linearly associated with the IES-R-K score (standardized \u03b2 coefficient \u2212 0.272, P = 0.026). Scores in Avoidance, Emotional numbing and Dissociation subscale were higher in patients with longer isolation period. Conclusion: MERS was a traumatic experience for quarantined HD patients.

This result is contrary to those of previous studies that showed a positive correlation between quarantine duration and post-traumatic stress symptoms [13, 14] . However, isolation duration does not mean duration only, but also represents participants' cooperativeness with the mandatory quarantine request. When HD patients who were exposed to MERS-CoV were asked to undergo mandatory quarantine, some were cooperative, such that they were admitted immediately following instructions by medical staff. Others resisted the isolation, dragging on until, finally, they were forcibly hospitalized at a later stage. Since all participants were later released from quarantine on the same day, the isolation duration indicated their cooperativeness with the mandatory quarantine and their trust in the prevention system of epidemics. Therefore, the results of this study indicated that participants who cooperated with the isolation request and received longer support reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms. At the subscale level, patients quarantined for less than 16 days showed higher avoidance, emotional numbing, and dissociation, compared to those quarantined for more than 16 days. Psychological trauma causes not only post-traumatic stress symptoms such as intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but also many other somatic and psychiatric symptoms due to its complexity and the diversity of symptoms, showing high levels of comorbidity with other problems [15] . Based on Lee [16] suggestion regarding posttraumatic growth, trauma-related symptoms occur in sequential order, as follows: catatonia, emotional numbing, dissociation, fear, intrusion, paranoid ideation, avoidance, obsession, hyperarousal, anxiety, depression, existential emptiness, searching for meaning, and posttraumatic growth. The results of the current study, indicating that participants showed emotional numbing and dissociation more often, compared to intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, in turn indicated that participants did not process the trauma and the isolation experience, so that their symptoms remained at the very early stage of processing trauma. This indicates that participants can experience subsequent symptoms of hyperarousal.

Furthermore, other factors in addition to isolation experience might affect psychological stress in quarantined HD patients. Third, we had no information about subjects' education level. Fourth, we did not measure other psychological and medical factors that could affect post-traumatic stress symptoms 12 months after isolation.
