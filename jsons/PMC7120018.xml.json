However, the same cells are permissive for infection with Ad2, and this infection is productive (3,21). The following steps in the virus\u2014host interaction have been characterized:\nAd12 adsorbs to the hamster cell surface, although much less efficiently than to human cells (22).Ad12 particles enter the cytoplasm.Ad12 DNA can be found in the nuclei of hamster cells (13,22).Ad12 DNA associates with the chromosomes (23).Ad12 DNA can integrate into the host chromosome (13,24\u201326).Some of the early Ad12 functions are transcribed, although inefficiently (22,27).By DNA array analyses, a limited number of changes in cellular transcription patterns can be documented upon the infection of BHK21 cells with Ad12 (Dorn, A. and Doerfler, W. unpublished results).Ad12 DNA replication cannot be detected (3,22,28).Ad12 VA and L1 RNAs are not transcribed (29).The region downstream of the major late promoter (MLP) of Ad12 DNA carries a 33-bp-long mitigator element,* which inactivates the MLP in hamster cells (30).Late Ad12 genes are not detectably transcribed (28,31).\nPer definitionem, new Ad12 virions are not produced in the abortive system (3).There is no cytopathic effect in Ad12-infected hamster cells (the infected cells continue to replicate [3]).As one of the biological consequences of the abortive infection of hamster cells, Ad12 induces undifferentiated tumors in newborn hamsters. (Ad2 fails to do so. The abortive mode of infection enables the Ad12 genome to become permanently fixed in the host genome and to survive for many cell generations. Productive infections would kill all infected cells.)\n",

The results were (34): (1) Ad12 DNA can replicate in these cells, although less efficiently than in permissive human cells; and (2) Ad12 late transcripts are not readily detectable (traces might be found late after infection). Although this approach was not particularly revealing for understanding the nature of the immediate block for Ad12 replication in BHK21 hamster cells, it yielded the unexpected result that overexpression of the Ad12 pTP gene alone, without enhanced transcription of the E1A genes, led to Ad12 DNA replication. It is conceivable that above-threshold concentrations of Ad12 pTP were capable of exerting previously unknown functions in preparing the hamster cells for nuclear import and replication of Ad12 DNA (even in the absence of large amounts of E1A gene products and beyond the well-known role that pTP can play in the initiation of Ad DNA replication). The data may suggest a novel role of Ad12 pTP in supporting Ad12 DNA nuclear import and replication in a nonpermissive cellular environment. What additional functions might pTP exert in controlling the uptake and transport of Ad12 DNA? Does the Ad12 DNA-bound TP in the infecting virion play a similar role?",

In rare instances (1/60), two insertion sites of Ad12 DNA in the hamster tumor genome have been observed (37). The sites of viral DNA integration are different from tumor to tumor, except for tumors derived as intraperitoneal seed metastases. Ad12- induced tumors are clonal. In all cells derived from one tumor, integration sites are identical. In the Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells, only some of the early Ad12 genes are transcribed at low efficiency. Viral transcription profiles are very similar from tumor to tumor (8). Late genes might be transcribed at extremely low levels, if at all. DNA array analyses of Ad12-induced tumor cells reveal both similarities and differences in cellular transcription patterns among different tumors (8). In an Ad12-induced hamster tumor cell line, about 1 kb of the adjacent cellular DNA showed changes in its methylation profile. Apparently, the insertion of foreign DNA into an established mammalian genome can alter DNA methylation at the site of foreign DNA insertion (38). In addition, foreign DNA insertion into an established genome can elicit alterations in DNA methylation and transcription patterns not only at the site of foreign DNA insertion but also at loci remote from the integration site (15\u201317).",

DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3a plus 3b seem to cooperate in this enzymatic reaction. The criteria for specific 5\u2019-CG-3\u2019 dinucleotide selection in the methylation reaction are still unknown. De novo methylation is also important in embryonic development: patterns of DNA methylation are erased and subsequently de novo re-established. Because promoter methylation serves as a long-term signal for gene inactivation (40), the introduction of 5-mC residues at specific sites has been considered an ancient defense against the activity of foreign genes (41,42). The de novo methylation reaction of DNA has more generally important functions in many biological systems that are not directly related to virology. These include the following:\nGene inactivation in transgenic cells and organisms.Genetic imprinting.X-chromosome inactivation.Altered transcription patterns during embryonal development.Long-term silencing of retrotransposons.Changes in transcription patterns in tumor cells.Cloning of organisms.Gene therapy.\n",

Changes in the methylation patterns of cellular genes can also be observed (major histocompatibility complex, IgC\u03bc, serine protease, cytochrome P450) (15). Thus, the integration of foreign DNA (several hundred kb to 1 Mb) on one chromosome, as in Ad12- induced tumor cells, might lead to structural perturbations of chromatin. This perturbation is hypothesized to be transmitted to neighboring chromosomes in interphase nuclei, possibly by interactions via the nuclear matrix. Methylation and transcription patterns can be altered in cis and in trans. The author pursues the concept that these changes are critically involved in causing the oncogenic phenotype (43).",

The 15 copies of Ad12 DNA in cell line T637 are less intensely methylated than the persisting Ad12 DNA in the revertant cell line TR12 (48). Detailed analyses of the patterns of methylation in the Ad12 integrates in cell line T637 and in its revertant TR12 are now being completed (26). It is conceivable that the extent of DNA methylation of transgenic DNAs, e.g., of the Ad12 genomes in cell lines T637 and TR12, is related to their stability of integration in the recipient genome.

            "text": "\nAd12-specific DNA segments corresponding to 28 different open reading frames of Ad12 DNA are amplified by PCR using appropriate primers and are cloned into M13mp18 vector DNA as described (8).Prepare single-stranded (ss) M13-Ad12 DNAs (we used 28 different clones) using the ss-M13-DNA purification kit.Denature the ssDNAs in 0.4 M NaOH, 5 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, fix on positively charged nylon membranes, and hybridize to 32P-labeled cDNA. (We used amounts of 20 or 100 ng of Ad12-M13 DNA for HeLa-Ad12 or BHK21-Ad12 DNA array analysis, respectively.)For reverse transcription and 32P-labeling of cDNA, total RNA from mock- or Ad12-infected cells is isolated by using a Macherey/Nagel kit. In this reaction, 5 \u03bcg of RNA, 2 \u00b5g of oligo (dT) 12\u201318 primers, and 1 mM of each of the dNTPs are denatured at 65\u00b0C for 5 min, chilled on ice, then mixed with 5 \u03bcCi of (\u03b3-32P)- dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 10 mM dithiothreitol, superscript II reaction buffer, and 300 U of superscript II reverse transcriptase and are incubated at 42\u00b0C for 1.5 h.Subsequently, the 32P-labeled probes are purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 columns and are hybridized to DNA arrays on membranes at 42\u00b0C for 20 h in DIG hybridization buffer.Wash membranes three times for 20 min in 0.5X standard sodium citrate, 1% SDS at 65\u00b0C and expose for 14 h (HeLa-Ad12) or 48 h (BHK21-Ad12) to X-ray films.
