Main outcome measures The incidence of intensive care unit admission, intubation, medical complications and death rate. Results Pregnancy had no discernible impact on clinical symptoms and presentation delay. Four out of the 10 pregnant patients, nevertheless, required endotracheal intubation and six were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), as compared with 12.5% intubation rate (P \u00bc 0.065) and 17.5% ICU admission rate (P \u00bc 0.012) in the non-pregnant group. More pregnant SARS patients developed renal failure (P \u00bc 0.006) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (P \u00bc 0.006), as compared with non-pregnant SARS group. There were three deaths in the pregnant group, whereas there was no death in the non-pregnant control group (P \u00bc 0.006).

One pregnant woman was admitted with atypical pneumonia before the SARS outbreak and was treated as viral pneumonia. She was retrospectively diagnosed having SARS after her serum SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody was raised (>300 titres). The other pregnant woman was admitted with fever for investigation; her initial investigations did not support SARS infection. She did not have any fever after admission but developed fever one week later. She was suspected to have contracted SARS within the ward and was confirmed on reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction. Because of her unique presentation, we could not find appropriate control for matching. Clinical findings and laboratory data of the remaining 10 pregnant patients were prospectively documented, and compared with another historical cohort of matched SARS nonpregnant patients over the same study period. Each of the pregnant patients was matched with four non-pregnant patients. They were matched with respect to sex, age, timing of contacting SARS, health care workers status, underlying illness and residence in the Amoy Garden highrise housing estate, where there was a community outbreak with over 300 residents infected. 7 The death rate for health care workers was considerably lower than the general population and was higher among Amoy Garden's residents. 8 The first four consecutive patients, fulfilling the matching criteria and admitted after the index pregnant patients, were chosen as the control group.",

Fever was the universal presenting symptom, and lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <1000/mm 3 ) was noted in all pregnant patients during the course of the SARS illness. There was no statistical difference in the temperature and lymphocyte count on admission between the two groups. The clinical manifestation in the two groups closely resembled those in previously reported series. 4,9 -11 The time between symptom onset and admission was not different statistically. Features of atypical pneumonia were evident on chest X-rays or high-resolution computed tomography. Baseline haemoglobin level on admission was lower for the pregnant group than that of the non-pregnant group (11.5 g/dL vs 12.7 g/dL, P \u00bc 0.036). However, treatment regimens were similar in the two groups. All women were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If there was no response within 48 hours, ribavirin and steroid were instituted. There was no difference in the timing of instituting antibiotic, ribavirin or steroid therapies. There were decreases in haemoglobin level in Lymphopenia was defined as absolute lymphocyte count below 1000/mm 3 , and thrombocytopenia as platelet count less than 140,000/mm 3 . both groups; 47% of non-pregnant women and 60% of pregnant women experienced haemoglobin level decrement of more than 2 g/dL. The nadir haemoglobin level was 8.4 g/dL in the pregnant group which was significantly lower than that in the non-pregnant group (10.6 g/dL). There was a trend of a more obvious fall in haemoglobin level in the pregnant group (3.2 g/dL vs 2.1 g/dL, P \u00bc 0.055). There was no difference in the nadir lymphocyte counts and platelet counts. Besides, the lactate dehydrogenase level (normal range 87 to 213 U/L) in the disease course was higher in the pregnant group (408.3 U/L vs 207.4 U/L, P < 0.0001). Table 3 showed the serious complication rates, requirement of endotracheal intubation and intensive care, and clinical outcomes between two groups of patients. In particular, significantly more pregnant women had complications of acute renal failure, sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. In the pregnant group, significantly more patients required intensive care (60% vs 17.5%, P \u00bc 0.012). Forty percent of patients in the pregnant group needed mechanical ventilatory support with positive end-expiratory pressure, whereas only 12.5% in the non-pregnant women required mechanical ventilation. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. There were three deaths in the pregnant group, whereas all women in the non-pregnant group survived (P \u00bc 0.006). After excluding the fatal cases, the pregnant women required a longer hospital stay than the non-pregnant group (27.0 days vs 17.3 days, P \u00bc 0.005).",

This is not unexpected, given the previous observations that the risk of viral pneumonia is significantly higher among pregnant women compared with the general population. 12 Indeed, the maternal mortality was 30-50% in the influenza epidemic in 1918. 13 Furthermore, the mortality rate in pregnant women was twice that in non-pregnant women in the Asian-flu epidemic in the 1950s. 14 Besides, pneumonia was reported to be a more common complication of varicella infection in pregnant women compared with the general population. 15 The worse outcome can be partly explained by the physiological changes in immunity and respiratory mechanics in pregnancy. Diminished cell-mediated immunity has been documented in pregnant women. 16, 17 Maternal lymphocytes obtained during the second and third trimesters exhibit a decreased proliferative response to antigen stimuli. There is also a decrease in natural killer cell activity. Given the presence of relative immunosuppressive status of pregnancy, it could set the stage for uncontrolled replication of the coronavirus.",

This was comparable with previous reports by various groups in Hong Kong 23 and Canada. 24 Physiological haemodilution in pregnancy lowers the haemoglobin level of pregnant women, as reflected in the difference of initial haemoglobin level between the two groups. A further drop in haemoglobin level might jeopardise the stressed oxygen carrying capacity of mother, adding further risk to pregnant SARS patients. In fact, the haemoglobin at presentation and the lowest haemoglobin were significantly lower in the pregnant group. The pregnant women also tended to have a more substantial drop, albeit insignificant statistically, in the haemoglobin level. We cannot rule out the possibility of increased susceptibility to haemolysis adverse effect among pregnant patients. Finally, a higher level of lactate dehydrogenase at presentation had been associated with poor outcome among SARS patients in most, 8, 24, 25 but not all, case series. 26, 27 Likewise, a higher lactate dehydrogenase level was found in our pregnant group, reflecting tissue necrosis related to immune hyperactivity in SARS. The presence of such adverse outcome predictor may reflect the severity of the disease course in pregnancy.",
