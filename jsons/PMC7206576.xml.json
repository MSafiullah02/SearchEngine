Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, among a group of individuals presenting with pneumonia of unknown etiology [1, 2]. Based on the sequencing and evolutionary data, bats are the proposed reservoir for the coronavirus [2, 3]. After its initial discovery, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide was rapid, with over 1.7 million confirmed cases globally and more than 100,000 deaths as of April 2020 [4]. The severity of this disease can range from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring aggressive measures to death [5, 6]. Current management strategies involve supportive treatment and protective measures to prevent further transmission of the virus [7, 8]. Though no potential cure has been reported, several trials are underway to determine the most appropriate treatment regimen.",

ACE2 physiologically counters RAAS activation and also serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [16]. ACE2 is expressed broadly in numerous tissues; however, lung alveolar epithelial cells are considered the primary targets [17]. Once CoV-2 gains entry into the target cell, the host response is a major determinant of severity of the ensuing pathogenesis (Fig. 1) [18]. The bronchial mucosa is lined by mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [19]. These innate-like lymphocytes respond rapidly to pathogen invasion and trigger a cytokine response essential for microbial killing [19]. The critical role of the host immune system in patients with severe COVID-19 infection is highlighted by the characteristics of patients who have died [15]. Clinical outcomes are dependent upon factors such as age, ACE2 expression, and comorbidities. Thus, cancer patients by virtue of being older (median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66 years in the USA) [20] and having higher ACE2 expression (ACE2 tends to increase with increasing age) [21] and more comorbidities [22] are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Figure 2 highlights the case-fatality rate by age group in the general population diagnosed with COVID-19 in China along with possible roles of mentioned factors.",

However, in cancer patients on active treatment or even during watchful observation, lymphopenia (an independent poor prognostic indicator in COVID-19 patients) [24] is common [25], and hence, the required immune response is impaired. Persistent cytokine release (likely mediated by leukocytes other than T lymphocytes) [23] may then lead to \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and cause significant lung damage. In addition to this damage, subpar specific immune response allows viral propagation, destruction of tissues, and progression to severe stages especially in ACE2-rich tissues, e.g., lung, intestine, and kidneys [23]. Therefore, strategies that augment immune response at this stage, e.g., immunoadjuvant therapies (IFN\u03b1 or convalescent plasma) [14\u2022, 19], block cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, or tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF\u03b1) or early institution of antiviral agents may prove beneficial.",

Persistent adaptive immune activation leading to lymphocyte exhaustion is well described in cases of chronic infections, tumorigenesis [26], and reportedly, even with SARS-CoV-1 infection [27]. Functional exhaustion of CTLs and NK cells is now reported with CoV-2 infection with significantly higher levels of exhaustion markers, e.g., programmed death-1 (PD-1), as compared to healthy controls [27, 28]. Functional exhaustion of CTLs correlates to [29] and likely results in viral disease progression and rapid decompensation [27]. Reports of successful use of anti-PD-1 drugs to reinvigorate exhausted T cells by blocking PD-1 in cases of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections are becoming common [19]. Foreseeably, clinical trials to study the use of anti-PD1 agent against COVID-19 are underway (Table 1).",

Some of the common laboratory findings seen in COVID-19 patients are cytopenias, specifically lymphocytopenia, along with elevation in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [14, 76]. COVID-19 patients should additionally be screened for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) via HScore [78].

            "text": "In addition to these suggested priority-driven guidelines, hospitals around the world have issued internal guidelines for oncologists, aiming to decrease patient exposure to COVID-19. Given the immunocompromised nature of the patient population, cancer centers have been adhering to strict infection control guidelines, in inpatient and outpatient settings. Outpatient visits, including ambulatory clinics and chemotherapy infusion visits, have been reduced [107]. Utilization of oral therapy regimens is recommended instead of parenteral anticancer therapies, if considered equivalent. This strategy can hence reduce patients\u2019 risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, without compromising oncological outcome, for instance, the use of capecitabine in place of 5-fluorouracil in patients receiving concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer [108]. Additionally, one must strongly consider delaying anticancer therapy in patients with stable cancer. Zhang et al. studied the outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19 on active anticancer therapy and reported more than fourfold higher likelihood of experiencing severe events in those who received therapy in the preceding 14 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (HR = 4.079, 95% CI 1.086\u201315.322, p = 0.037) [14\u2022]. However, for aggressive cancers, it is warranted to have a risk\u2013benefit assessment and proceeding with cancer treatment if benefits outweigh risks. As precisely mentioned by Wang et al., the major risk factor for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is their inability to receive sufficient medical support [109]. To further minimize patient exposure to COVID-19, clinicians could consider the option of chemotherapy break and the possibility of performing home laboratory draws for toxicity assessment if feasible. To avoid patients\u2019 exposure to pharmaceutical departments, patients could use drive-through pick-up or hospitals could utilize a courier medication delivery service [107, 110].",

In the current pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) have advised rescheduling elective surgeries if possible [111, 112]. Evidence suggests that patients who received surgery and concomitantly contracted COVID-19 were at much higher risk of severe clinical events than those who did not have surgery [9\u2022]. Despite these advisories, it is important for clinicians and patients to have risk assessment discussions prior to making treatment decisions. Part of the discussion should also entail resource availability, as surgeries often require post-operative care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the current shortage of ICU beds, it is important to delegate resources efficiently. In instances, specifically early stage cancers where surgery is often the first step in management, patients could be offered neoadjuvant therapy, and surgery could be delayed without compromising patient outcomes [104]. Evidence suggests that 60-day delays in surgical intervention of early stage breast cancer has been documented without worsening oncological outcomes [113].",

Given the nature of the treatment, patients have to attend radiation therapy (RT) sessions daily and the interruption of therapy is rather unacceptable [107]. Considering varied clinical scenarios, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) recently published brief guidelines for radiation oncologists dealing with COVID-19 pandemic. As noted by ASTRO, if considered reasonable, hypofractionated schedules are encouraged [114]. Additionally, in patients with rapidly progressing disease or potentially curable tumors where RT significantly impacts survival, treatment should be prioritized as benefits outweigh risks. On the contrary, patients receiving palliative RT for symptom control or where interrupting the radiation course would not cause potential harm, one should consider delaying the treatment [104, 114].",
