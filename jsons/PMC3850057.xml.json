            "text": "The T cell response is critical for pathogen clearance and tumor eradication and is mediated by interactions between the T cell receptor and MHC class I or II/peptide (MHCp) complex. Multiple factors, including the kinetics and affinity of the interaction, size of the T cell precursor pool, kinetics of peptide presentation and affinity of the peptide for the MHC antigen are critical for understanding the T cell response in a given physiological or pathological setting. Further, the response to a single epitope is generally complex, involving T cells with a variety of affinities for the MHCp complex. In addition, expansion of a specific T cell in a single immune response is partly stochastic, depending on access of the T cell in question to the MHCp. Finally, the number of epitope-specific cells in the na\u00efve T cell pool is small, ranging from less than 100 to 1000 cells (Pewe et al., 2004, Moon et al., 2007, Obar et al., 2008, La Gruta et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2011), making it difficult to monitor endogenous T cell responses at early times after stimulation.",

            "text": "Many of these problems are circumvented by the use of T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) mice. While in some cases only the TCR-\u03b2 or TCR-\u03b1 chain is engineered (e.g., (Turner et al., 1996), most commonly, both the alpha and beta chains of the TCR are fixed in TCR Tg mice, increasing the fraction of cells in the na\u00efve pool that recognize the epitope in question (Barnden et al., 1998). The majority of the T cells in these mice express the Tg T cell receptor, making them an excellent source for large numbers of clonotype-specific cells. Transgenic TCR T cells generally recognize MHCp complexes and function similarly to polyclonal T cells recognizing the same epitope. Development of transgenic mice is most often preceded by the generation of T cell clones specific for the epitope under study. Epitope-specific T cell clones are isolated after repeated stimulation in vitro and limiting dilution; it is well established that the conditions under which T cells are expanded contribute to the selection of T cells with varying affinity for the MHCp. Thus, CD8 T cells selected in the presence of low levels of antigen exhibit high affinity for MHCp whereas exposure to high levels of antigen results in the outgrowth of cells with low affinity (Alexander-Miller et al., 1996). T cells with high versus low affinity for MHCp will behave differently in an infected or cancerous animal and neither type of cell may represent a cell with average functionality in the general population of T cells responding to an epitope.",

            "text": "Mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) develop acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelination (Stohlman et al., 1998). We and others showed previously that demyelination is T cell mediated, involving virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells (Wang et al., 1990, Wu et al., 2000). Further, clinical disease in mice with acute encephalitis is largely CD4 T cell-driven (Anghelina et al., 2006). Thus, mutation of the immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (M133, spanning residues 133\u2013147 of the transmembrane M protein, TVYVRPIIEDYHTLLT) recognized in C57Bl/6 mice resulted in a loss of virulence in this strain, but not BALB/c mice (H-2d) or in RAG1-/- mice, which lack T or B cells. Virulence could be restored if another immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (from Listeria monocytogenes) was introduced into the M133-mutated virus, indicating that the CD4 T cell response was pathogenic. On the other hand, our results also demonstrated that the memory CD4 T cell response was protective. In another report, we showed that a population of regulatory CD4 T cells in the brains of mice infected with a neuroattenuated variant of JHMV (rJ2.2) recognized epitope M133 (Zhao et al., 2011). Understanding the relationship between effector, memory and regulatory CD4 T cells responding to a single epitope would be facilitated by the availability of an M133-specific TCR Tg mouse.",

B6 donor bone marrow cells were transduced with these particles and then infused into lethally irradiated (950 rad) recipient B6 mice as described previously (Holst et al., 2006a, Holst et al., 2006b). Mice were infected with rJ2.2 at 6\u201310 weeks after reconstitution. The majority of CD4 T cells in the infected CNS were GFP+. Using I-Ab/M133 tetramers (NIH Tetramer Facility, Atlanta, GA), we sorted 7.5 \u00d7 105\n M133-specific GFP+ cells from the infected CNS and analyzed them for TCR-\u03b1 chain expression. For this purpose, a panel of pooled V\u03b1 primers (pool 1: V\u03b11: GCACTGATGTCCATCTTCCTC; V\u03b12: AAAGGGAGAAAAAGCTCTCC; V\u03b13: AAGTACTATTCCGGAGACCC; V\u03b14: CAGTATCCCGGAGAAGGTC; pool 2: V\u03b15: CAAGAAAAGACAAACGACTCTC; V\u03b16: ATGGCTTTCCTGGCTATTGCC; V\u03b17: TCTGTAGTCTTCCAGAAATC; V\u03b18: CAACAAGAGGACCGAGCACC; pool 3: V\u03b19:TAGTGACTGTGGTGGATGTC; V\u03b110: AACGTCGCAGCTCTTTGCAC; V\u03b111: CCCTGCACATCAGGGATGCC; V\u03b112: TCTGTTTATCTCTGCTGACC; pool 4: V\u03b113: ACCTGGAGAGAATCCTAAGC; V\u03b114: TCCTGGTTGACCAAAAAGAC; V\u03b116: CATTCGCTCAAATGTGAACAG; V\u03b117: GGAAAATGCAACAGTGGGTC; pool 5: V\u03b118: CAAATGAGAGAGAGAAGCGC; V\u03b119: TGGTTTGAAGGACAGTGGGC; V\u03b120: GACATGACTGGCTTCCTGAAGGCCTTGC) was used in conjunction with a common C\u03b1 reverse primer (TGGCGTTGGTCTCTTTTGAAG). Four TCR-\u03b1 chains were identified, differing only by single amino acid in the CDR3 region. One of these TCR-\u03b1 chains was produced synthetically and cloned into the retroviral vector described above (Holst et al., 2006a). In this vector, the TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 chains are linked via a self-cleaving protease (protease 2A), enabling stoichiometric production of the two chains.",

These studies described diversity of the T cell response to CD8 T cell epitopes recognized in B6 mice infected with JHMV (epitopes S510 and S598) or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV, epitope gp33). We next extended our analyses to the immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133) recognized in B6 mice (Xue et al., 1995). Up to 25% of the CD4 T cells in the acutely infected brain respond to epitope M133 (Zhao et al., 2009). At the time that these experiments were initiated, an I-Ab/M133 tetramer was not available so we identified epitope-specific cells using an IFN-\u03b3 capture assay, as described in Materials and Methods. The IFN-\u03b3 capture assay captured no more than 50% of M133-specific T cells (data not shown), making analyses of infected brains difficult. Therefore, in order to obtain sufficient cells for analysis, we stained and sorted M133-specific cells from the spleens of mice after intraperitoneal infection with JHMV. As shown in Fig. 1, M133-specific CD4 T cells were readily detected in the spleen using an IFN-\u03b3 capture assay. Next, these CD4 T cells were sorted from three individual mice and RNA prepared. V\u03b28 is the most commonly expressed V\u03b2 element, used by approximately 20% of all M133-specific CD4 T cells (Haring et al., 2001), so primers encoding V\u03b28 and C\u03b2 sequences were used to develop cDNA clones that spanned the CDR3. The CDR3 is the region of greatest variability in TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 chains so can be used to determine the diversity of the response. 87\u2013100 cDNA clones were sequenced from each mouse. The results indicated that there was extensive TCR-\u03b2 chain diversity, with 39\u201346 unique \u03b2 chains identified per mouse (Table 1\n).",

One TCR-\u03b2 chain, containing TRBV13-1 and TRBJ2-2 elements (CDR3: ARDM) was abundant in 2/3 mice and was chosen for further studies. A complete TCR-\u03b2 chain was produced and single chain M133 TCR retrogenic mice were developed, as described in Materials and Methods. By 5 weeks after reconstitution, 20\u201335% of CD4 T cells in the blood of each mouse expressed GFP (Fig. 2A). After infection with rJ2.2, these cells trafficked to the brain, comprising 55% of the total and > 90% of the M133-specific CD4 T cell response (Fig. 2B). To identify the TCR-\u03b1 chain(s) associated with the fixed TCR-\u03b2 chain, cells were stained with I-Ab/M133 tetramers and tetramer+GFP+ CD4 T cells were sorted. RNA was isolated from these cells and used to prepare cDNA. Using a panel of pools of PCR primers for the most commonly used V\u03b1 elements, we sequenced 71 cDNA clones. Twenty four of these 71 cDNA clones contained in frame sequences and all 24 cDNA clones encoded the V\u03b12.3 (TRAV14-1) and J\u03b133 (TRAJ33) elements, with the following sequences: CASS [DP (11 clones)/AP (11 clones)/LP (1 clone)/AG (1 clone)] TGNYKYVFGA. Additional sequence analysis revealed that the \u03b1 chain contained the TRAV14-1*01 element. A complete M133 TCR-\u03b1 containing one of the common CDR3 (AP) was expressed synthetically, and introduced into the same retroviral transduction vector as above. Retrogenic mice expressing both the M133 TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 chains were generated by bone marrow transduction and reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice (Fig. 3A). CD4 T cells expressing the retrogenic M133-specific TCR trafficked to the CNS after infection with rJ2.2 and expressed both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 after peptide stimulation directly ex vivo (Fig. 3B, C).",

Therefore, to develop a reliable supply of M133-specific cells, we engineered a transgenic mouse expressing the same TCR as used in the TCR retrogenic mice as described in Materials and Methods (section 2.9). Unlike the TCR retrogenic mice, M133-specific cells in the Tg mice did not express GFP, limiting detection to use of I-Ab/M133 tetramers or dual V\u03b28.3/V\u03b12 staining. As expected for a TCR Tg mouse recognizing a CD4 T cell epitope, the great majority of T cells in the blood were CD4+ (Fig. 4A).

To verify that the T cell response at the site of inflammation was epitope M133-specific, we harvested lymphocytes from the brains of infected M133 TCR Tg mice and analyzed them directly ex vivo for cytokine expression. At both days 7 and 14 p.i., the majority of cells in the infected brain predominantly responded to epitope M133 (Fig. 4E). Unexpectedly, the majority of cells at day 7 p.i. expressed TNF but not IFN-\u03b3 but by 14 days p.i., the predominant populations expressed IFN-\u03b3. Whether this temporal difference in cytokine expression contributes to disease pathogenesis requires further investigation. These M133-specific CD4 T cells were not able, however, to clear virus from the infected brain (Fig. 4F). Virus is cleared by 10\u201314 days p.i. from the brains of B6 mice ((Parra et al., 1999), Fig. 4F). However, in marked contrast, virus titers in M133 TCR Tg mice were elevated compared to B6 mice and did not diminish between days 7 and 10 p.i., providing an explanation for the increased mortality observed in the M133 TCR Tg mice. These stably high virus titers reflect a requirement for an effective anti-virus CD8 T cell response for optimal virus clearance (Bergmann et al., 2006) and a lack of MHC class II expression on oligodendrocytes, the predominant cell type infected in the brain (Redwine et al., 2001).",

The resultant mouse encodes a TCR selected on the basis of its \u201cpublic\u201d sequence based on its detection in all of the mice examined. In this approach, the TCR-\u03b2 chain was identified initially and on further analysis, using TCR-\u03b2 retrogenic mice, was found to pair with a limited number of closely related TCR-\u03b1 chains, simplifying selection of the second TCR chain. Thus, consistent with previous reports, fixation of one of the TCR chains resulted in very limited diversity in the other chain, illustrating how only some combinations of TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 chains allow recognition of specific peptide/MHC complexes (Turner et al., 1996). After adoptive transfer, M133 TCR Tg cells are useful for tracking the epitope-specific CD4 T cell response. This will be useful in mice infected with neurotropic strains of murine coronaviruses, in which cells responding to the M133 epitope are pathogenic (primary), protective (memory) or immunomodulatory (Treg) (Anghelina et al., 2006, Savarin et al., 2008, Zhao et al., 2011).",

Alternatively, TCRs that are public can be identified using single cell RT-PCR techniques (Dash et al., 2011). These mice will allow for probing of the relationship between T cell clonotypes that are present in the precursor pool in all mice (those bearing public sequences) and functional avidity and, in the context of infection, protective function.",
