Although Shenzhen still enjoyed certain advantages in the production and control process, it lagged behind, to some extent, Hainan, Xiamen and Shantou in the scores concerning the growth rate of the output value from new and high-tech industries and the added value from the modern service industries which constituted the scores concerning green production. This was mainly because those special economic zones were mostly in the industrialization or post-industrialization process; the advantages of the scale of new and high-tech and service industries had yet been fully tapped, and it was difficult for Shenzhen to maintain rapid growth on a large scale after many years of development; Shenzhen lagged behind Xiamen and Shantou in green control; Zhuhai was better than Shenzhen in green environment. As a relatively mature special zone at the developmental stage, Shenzhen should intensify its green control and improve its green environment in order to speed up the green transformation of its industries in the future.",

This was mainly attributable to Xiamen\u2019s outstanding advantages in green production and green control. According to the scores concerning both primary indicators, Xiamen ranked No. 1 among the five major special economic zones\u2014Xiamen\u2019s score concerning its capability for green production was 1.33 times that of Shenzhen, and Xiamen\u2019s score for its capability for green control was 1.66 times that of Shenzhen. Its excellent scores concerning capability for green production and green control mainly resulted from the rapid adjustment of the industrial structure in Xiamen. From 2014 to 2015, Xiamen\u2019s three-industry structure was rapidly adjusted from 0.7:45.8:53.5 to 0.7:43.5:55.8; the rapid increase in the proportion of the tertiary industry made Xiamen enjoy the highest score concerning the change value of the three-industry structure. With the rapid development of the service industry, the industrial structure was rapidly optimized and the consumption of energy and electric power decreased rapidly. Xiamen ranked No. 1 among the five major special economic zones in the rate of reduction in consumption of energy and electric power per unit of GDP, suggesting that the adjustment of the industrial structure was highly related to the green transformative development of industries in an area. Compared with Shenzhen\u2019s high capability for green transformation, Xiamen was defective in green input, green benefits and green environment, so accelerating the intensive development of industries and the development of the environmentally-friendly industries is still the top priority for Xiamen in its future green transformative development of industries.",

Zhuhai was advantaged in per capita park green land area among the three indicators which constituted the score concerning green environment, so Zhuhai\u2019s score in green environment covered its gap with Shenzhen in the quality of the air and PM2.5. It is noteworthy that Zhuhai still has great weaknesses in green production and green control. These weaknesses cause Zhuhai to have nearly a one-fold gap with Shenzhen in the overall score. In 2015, although Zhuhai enjoyed an advantage in green environment, that advantage was not firm so the other areas caught up with and surpassed it more rapidly. It is necessary for Zhuhai to make integrated efforts in green transformation by reinforcing its industries, narrowing the gap with Shenzhen and Xiamen in green transformative development of the industries in the future.",

Noteworthily, although Hainan has made great progress in promoting optimization and adjustment of the industrial structure in recent years, the introduction of petrochemical and smelting projects has greatly undermined the green development of its industries. In Hainan, the tourism industry, Hainan\u2019s pillar industry, is less related to the modern manufacturing and modern service industries, and the industrial chain is short. Given these striking problems, there was a long way to go and heavy responsibilities for Hainan in the transformative development of its industries.

Against the general background of the current increasing resource and environmental constraints, in order to intensify transformation in the future, it is essential for the special economic zones to more rapidly build a market-oriented industrial structure with high technological content, low resource consumption and less environmental pollution. However, the green transformative development of industries is not merely the development of the environmental protection industry or an emerging energy-saving industry; on the contrary, it means that it is necessary to make changes in various aspects, from value concepts to production modes, and these changes involve not only technologies and capital, but also the people\u2019s mindsets and standard procedures. Therefore, speeding up the green transformative development of industries is a profound change in the current industrial development of the special economic zones, even of China itself.

Thus it is necessary for the five major special economic zones to make well-targeted efforts to address their developmental weaknesses according to their own conditions in the process of promoting the green transformation of industries. Specifically, although Shenzhen enjoys outstanding advantages in green input and green benefits, and high technical strength in boosting the green transformation of industries, there is a need for intensifying efforts in green control, cultivation of green industries and environmental protection. Xiamen and Shenzhen complement each other to some extent in pushing forward the green transformation of industries. Xiamen should take targeted actions to increase the green input and promote green technologies in the future. Only when innovation-driven development is strengthened can the green benefits from industrial development gradually become apparent. Zhuhai, Shantou and Hainan enjoy certain advantages in some fields relating to green input, green production, green control, green benefits and green environment, but they have a great gap with Shenzhen and Xiamen in the overall score.
