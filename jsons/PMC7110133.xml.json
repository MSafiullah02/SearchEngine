            "text": "\nRobust EBOV GP-dependent entry into B-THP cells after DCSIGN/R expression. We first investigated whether expression of DC-SIGN/R allows EBOV GP-mediated infection of otherwise nonsusceptible cells. We chose B-THP cells [28], which are derived from the Raji B cell line, for these experiments, because B cell lines have been shown to be refractory to EBOV GP-driven infection [3]. Indeed, incubation of parental B-THP control cells with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes bearing the GPs of the 4 EBOV subspecies\u2014ZEBOV, Sudan EBOV (SEBOV), Ivory Coast EBOV (ICEBOV), and Reston EBOV (REBOV)\u2014did not result in signals above background levels (figure 1A). Thus, luciferase activities of 10\u2013100 counts/s are usually measured after mock infection or infection with GPdeficient control viruses, and they are therefore considered to be unspecific [12, 29] (A.M. and S.P., unpublished data). In contrast, all GPs mediated robust infection of B-THP cells ex pressing exogenous DC-SIGN/R (figure 1A). ZEBOV GP and REBOV GP engaged DC-SIGN/R with higher efficiency than did SEBOV GP and, in particular, ICEBOV GP, as has been reported elsewhere [8, 29] for susceptible cells. Antibody inhibition experiments demonstrated that EBOV GP-mediated entry into B-THP cells expressing DC-SIGN/R was indeed dependent on GP interactions with these lectins (figure 1B). Thus, the DC-SIGNR-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 604 strongly reduced entry into B-THP DC-SIGNR-expressing cells, but it had no effect on entry into B-THP DC-SIGN cells. The reverse observation was made with MAb 507, which is DCSIGN specific (figure 1B). Finally, MAb 526, which is dual specific, blocked EBOV GP-driven entry into both B-THP DCSIGN and DC-SIGNR cells, confirming that EBOV GP engages DC-SIGN/R for entry into B-THP cells. These results indicate that exogenous DC-SIGN/R can allow EBOV GP-mediated infection of B-THP cells.",

We analyzed the relevance of these motifs for DC-SIGN/R- mediated augmentation of EBOV GP-dependent infection. To this end, the LL motifs in DC-SIGN/R and the YXXL sequence in DC-SIGN were mutated (variants AA and AXXG) (figure 2A), or the entire cytoplasmic tails of DC-SIGN/R were deleted (variants DN-ter) (figure 2A).

Double mutation of the LL and YXXL motifs in DC-SIGN diminished expression to \u223c50%, compared with wt DC-SIGN, whereas deletion of the entire DC-SIGN cytoplasmic domain resulted in 80% reduction in expression (figure 2B, top).

A strict correlation between DC-SIGN expression levels and augmentation of EBOV GP\u2014dependent infection has been documented elsewhere [11], indicating that the effects observed after mutation of the YXXL and LL motifs were merely the result of limited DC-SIGN/R expression and not due to specific defects induced by these alterations.

We next investigated whether the LL motif in DC-SIGN and its surrounding sequences are dispensable for EBOV GP-driven infectious entry into B-THP cells. To this end, B-THP cells expressing a DC-SIGN variant lacking the N-terminal 20 amino acids [19], which encompass the LL motif (\u039420) (figure 2A), were analyzed for lectin expression and enhancement of EBOV GP-dependent entry. Parental BTHP cells, B-THP DC-SIGN cells, and B-THP DC-SIGN cells sorted for high levels of DC-SIGN expression (hiDC-SIGN) were used as controls. FACS analyses revealed that B-THP \u039420 DC-SIGN cells expressed less lectin molecules on the surface than did B-THP DC-SIGN cells, whereas the highest levels of lectin expression were detected on B-THP hiDC-SIGN cells (figure 3A). All lectin-expressing cell lines were readily infected by EBOV GP pseudotypes, although infection efficiency was dependent on the efficiency of lectin expression, with B-THP hiDC-SIGN cells being most susceptible and B-THP \u039420 DCSIGN cells being least susceptible (figure 3A and 3B). Analyses of lectin internalization triggered by an antibody directed against the DC-SIGN lectin domain (507) or a control antibody (DCN 46) demonstrated less-efficient internalization of the \u039420 DC-SIGN variant relative to the wt protein (figure 3C), as reported elsewhere [30\u201333].

FACS analyses revealed that both cell lines expressed very similar amounts of DC-SIGN (figure 4A) and that, on both cells, DC-SIGN was readily internalized after ligand binding (figure 3C) (data not shown). Accordingly, both cell lines were equally adept in transferring HIV-1 to T cells, although transmission was partly due to direct infection of the transmitting cells (figure 4B), as described elsewhere [30, 34, 35]. In contrast, only B-THP DC-SIGN cells-not Ramos DCSIGN cells-were readily susceptible to EBOV GP-dependent infection. Both cell lines could be infected by vesicular stomatitis virus GP-bearing pseudotypes, although with different efficiencies (figure 4C), suggesting that, apart from DC-SIGN, another molecule is required for EBOV GP-dependent entry into Ramos B cells. In this case, the role of DC-SIGN in EBOV infection might be limited to concentrating virions on the cell surface, which, in turn, might increase entry via so far unidentified receptor(s).",

Thus, B-THP cells most likely express low levels of receptor, which can be engaged efficiently only by EBOV GP\u2014bearing viruses after augmentation of virus attachment, either by DC-SIGN or by spinoculation. To extend these observations, we assessed whether augmentation of viral attachment by spinoculation allowed EBOV GP-driven entry into a broader panel of B cell lines. Indeed, the B cell line NC-37 [28] was found to be susceptible to EBOV GP pseudotypes under these conditions, and infectious entry was further enhanced by expression of exogenous DC-SIGN (figure 5B). Similarly, infection of the BC 11 cell line was readily detectable after spinoculation.

To us, therefore, it was unexpected that DC-SIGN/R expression rendered B-THP cells permissive. The discrepancy between our previous and present observations might be the result of differences in DC-SIGN expression levels, which strictly correlate with the efficiency of augmentation of EBOV GP-dependent infection [11], or of variations in the expression of endogenous EBOV receptor(s) on the target cells used in both studies. In any event, data published elsewhere [9] and the results of the present study indicate that expression of DCSIGN on certain lymphoid cell lines is sufficient for robust EBOV GP-dependent infection, and they pose the question of whether DC-SIGN functions as an EBOV receptor.",

            "text": "If DC-SIGN alone can act as a receptor for filovirus entry into B cells, DC-SIGN expression on different, otherwise nonpermissive B cell lines should allow for viral infection. Moreover, EBOV engagement of this lectin should lead to uptake of virions into intracellular vesicles, where the fusion machinery in GP is activated upon cleavage by cellular cathepsins [18, 39]. Our results suggest that DC-SIGN/R might not fulfill either criterion. Thus, alterations in the DC-SIGN/R cytoplasmic tails that prevent efficient internalization of lectin-ligand complexes did not abrogate augmentation of EBOV GP-mediated entry. DC-SIGN/R-mediated endocytic uptake of virions might therefore be dispensable for enhancement of EBOV infection. Similar observations have recently been reported for dengue virus [32], which also engages DC-SIGN [40, 41]. Furthermore, comparable expression of exogenous DC-SIGN on B-THP and Ramos B cells rendered only the former cells readily susceptible to EBOV GP-dependent infection. Thus, apart from DC-SIGN, other factors might be required to allow EBOV GP-mediated cellular entry. In fact, our observation that artificial concentration of virions on the cell surface allows for EBOV GP-driven entry into B-THP and NC-37 B cells indicates that these cells express very low levels of EBOV receptors, which can only be engaged efficiently once a substantial number of viral particles are attached to the cell surface. Such conditions might be established by DC-SIGN expression, which facilitates efficient capture of virions harboring EBOV GP [11]. Taken together, these results point to a function of DC-SIGN as an attachment factor and not a receptor for filoviruses.",

It has recently been reported that a subpopulation of B cells in human blood expresses DC-SIGN and that expression is augmented after B cell activation [42]. We therefore thought to study EBOV GP-dependent entry into DC-SIGN-positive, primary B cells, but we failed to detect DCSIGN on these cells (data not shown), for reasons that are, at present, unclear. Similarly, we also failed to detect endogenous DC-SIGN on any of the nontransduced B cells analyzed, including the BC 11 line, which supported EBOV GP-driven infectious entry (data not shown), suggesting that lectin expression on cell lines does not mirror that reported for activated, primary B cells. MDDCs express high levels of endogenous DC-SIGN and are permissive to EBOV infection [25, 43, 44]. DC-SIGN-positive cells with DC morphology were also shown to be infected in ZEBOV-inoculated macaques [2]. However, entry of ZEBOV into MDDCs was only \u223c50% dependent on mannose-specific lectins, such as DC-SIGN, implying an important contribution of other cellular factors. Of note, several reports suggest that DC-SIGN\u2014positive cells in lymphoid tissues might not be of DC origin but, rather, of macrophage origin [14, 45, 46]. These observations and the findings of the present study raise doubts about an important contribution of DC-SIGN\u2014mediated infection of DCs to the spread of EBOV in the host.",
