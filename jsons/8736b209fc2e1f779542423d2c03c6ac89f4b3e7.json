            "text": "Stress is a prominent risk factor for the onset and maintenance of alcohol misuse. For example, chronic alcohol use results in neuroadaptations in stress and reward pathways, which lead to dysfunctional hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical and sympathetic adrenomedullary axes, characterised by dysregulation of the cortisol response and deficits in emotional regulation. 2 In turn, these neuroadaptations lead to increased cravings for alcohol in response to stress. The effects of long-term social isolation on stress levels, including increased neuroendocrine responses and stress reactivity, have been described in non-human animals. 3 However, the ongoing lockdowns across many countries are unique and little is known of the effects on the general population of chronic isolation (with respect to health and wellbeing) in these circumstances A risk factor for the onset and maintenance of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder is trait impulsivity (ie, the tendency to take risks or act without adequate forethought or reflection). Impulsivity can moderate stress-induced consumption of alcohol 4 and is also associated with relapse in addicted individuals. 5 Thus, this period of isolation might lead to a spike in alcohol misuse, relapse, and potentially, development of alcohol use disorder in at-risk individuals, therefore placing further strain on addiction and drug and alcohol services, and the health service in general, during and after the pandemic.",
