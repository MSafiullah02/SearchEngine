Due to the statistical nature of this problem, the most likely or the most parsimonious ancestral genomes usually include considerable error rates. In general, these errors cannot be abolished by utilizing more exhaustive computational approaches, by using longer genomic sequences, or by analyzing more taxa. In recent studies we showed that co-evolution is an important force that can be used for significantly improving the inference of ancestral genome content.",

The first approach for inferring ancestral genomic sequences TT and HB contributed equally to this work. was suggested by Fitch around 40 years ago [18] . This first algorithm assumed a binary alphabet, and was based on the Maximum Parsimony (MP) criteria, i.e. find the labels to the internal nodes of a tree that minimize the number of mutations along the tree edges. Over the years this basic algorithm was generalized in many ways. Sankoff showed how to efficiently solve versions of the maximum parsimony problem with a non-binary alphabet and with multiple edge weights [43] . Similar algorithms for inferring ancestral sequences based on maximum likelihood (ML; instead of maximum parsimony) were suggested more than 15 years later [1, 40, 8, 17, 30, 38] . Recently, similar approaches were used to infer ancestral sequences in phylogenetic networks [25] .",

These results support using the greedy algorithm if running time matters. The fact that the upper bound of the ACE7 < 1.3 demonstrates that our approach can find solutions that are very close to the optimal ones. As we used here an upper bound on the approximation ratio the actual ratio can be significantly lower.",

We represented each of the 17 genomes by a binary string of length 33931 where 1 in the x position of a string means that there is a gene/protein from the x group of orthologs in this genome, and 0 means that there is no gene/protein from the x group of orthologs in this genome. We used Neyman's two state model [36] , a version of Jukes Cantor (JC) model [27] for inferring the edge lengths of the tree by maximum likelihood. This was done by PAML [50] . These edge lengths correspond to the probabilities that a protein will appear/vanish along the corresponding lineage.",

A major fraction of the discrepancies between the results of the ACE algorithm and those obtained with the conventional methods (ML and MP) appears in the Euascomycota subtree (internal nodes 0 \u2212 2 in the Fungi tree; see Figure 5 A.). In general, ACE mainly added proteins to these nodes, implying that ML/MP underestimated the size of these ancestral genomes. Additionally, both in the case of MP and ML, the ACE added/removed many proteins from internal nodes 14 and 15. It is important to note that the likelihood score of the ACE solution was only 0.25% lower than the ML score, demonstrating that this solution was very close to the ML point. Similarly, when the ACE was implemented with MP the parsimony score of its solution was only 2.2% higher than that of the MP solution. These solutions, however, are supported by the co-evolutionary information and thus are more biologically plausible.",

Second, all these proteins have orthologs in most of the analyzed Fungi (on average in 76% of the Fungi); this fact also supports the essentiality of these proteins.

First, currently, our approach is presented in the setup of ancestral genome reconstruction, due to the importance of this problem and because co-evolutionary information can be readily obtained on the gene/protein level. However, it is important to note that the potential scope of our approach goes beyond the ancestral genome reconstruction problem, to tackle the more general problem of ancestral sequence reconstruction: that is, the reconstruction of different sites or domains in proteins, and even (provided that sufficient information is available) the reconstruction of single sites in DNA or RNA sequences (see [52, 53, 33, 39, 28, 42] ). In this setup, the success of such future applications depends on the existence of reliable co-evolutionary information on the individual site level. Second, it is also clear that our approach can be generalized in the future to more complex reconstruction models (for example, using non-binary alphabets, dependency between close sites, and various versions of maximum likelihood). Third, we intend to design algorithms that may compete with those described in this work. Specifically, we intend to check algorithms that are based on the belief propagation [31] approach. Finally, we believe that a generalization of the approach described in this work can be used for joint inference of ancestral genomes and protein interactions or for joint inference of ancestral genomes and metabolic networks of ancestral and extant organisms.",
