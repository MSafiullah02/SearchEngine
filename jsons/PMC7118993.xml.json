            "text": "Neurologic disease is seen commonly in cats. For example, neurologic cases make up approximately 10% of the case load of two separate feline medicine referral clinics (D.A. Gunn-Moore, BVM&S, PhD, Edinburgh University Feline Clinic data, 2004) [1]. There are many well-documented causes of neurologic disorder in cats [2], [3], and infectious causes are believed to account for 30% to 45% of cases [1], [4]. It is important to realize that a specific cause cannot be identified in 12% to 40% of cases, however. This holds true when looking at clinical cases [2], [5], [6] and histopathologic data (\nTable 1) [1], [4]. In addition, although there are many known infectious causes (\nBox 1), a large number of cases (35%\u201340%) are found to have histopathologic changes suggestive of viral infection (that is not consistent with feline infectious peritonitis [FIP]), but no causal agent can be identified (\nTable 2) [1], [4]. This group becomes even more significant if you consider cats with particular clinical signs. For example, of 30 cats that were investigated for having recurrent seizures, all were found to have structural brain disease and 14 (47%) had nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis suggestive of a viral infection, but no infectious agent could be found [5].Box 1Naturally occurring infectious causes of central nervous system disease in domestic cats\nViralFeline coronavirus (FCoV)a\nFeline panleukopenia virus (FPV)Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)Rabies virusAujeszky's disease virusFeline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1)Borna disease virus (BDV)Certain arboviruses (see text)\nBacterial\nPasturella\n\nStaphylococcus\nOther aerobic organismsAnaerobic organismsMycobacteria\nProtozoalToxoplasmosisa\n\nRickettsialEhrlichiosis\nFungalCryptococcosisa\nBlastomycosisHistoplasmosisAspergillosisDematiaceous fungi\nParasiticCuterebra larval myiasisVisceral larva migrans (eg, Toxocara)Sarcocystis\nDirofilaria immitis\n\nProbable and otherFeline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE)Feline polioencephalomyelitis and miscellaneous nonsuppurative (meningo)encephalitidesa\n\n\n\naMost common causes of encephalitis in cats.

In addition, the most common infectious agents are feline coronaviruses (FCoV, which can cause FIP) and some other, as yet unidentified, infectious agent(s), which are probably viruses [1], [5]. Unfortunately, because we cannot identify the cause, we do not know how best to treat these cases, nor do we know how to prevent them. It is therefore essential that we try harder to identify the etiology behind the pathologic findings. This means performing more detailed diagnostics on individual clinical cases, such as looking for potential infectious organisms by serology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IgG quotient, and IgG index [6]; CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect the infectious organism's DNA or RNA [7]; and immunohistochemistry or PCR on brain samples collected postmortem. In addition, it underlines the need for further experimental investigation into potential pathogens. It is only by adopting a more questioning approach to disease pathogenesis that we can hope to determine what may be causing neurologic disease in many of our pet cats.",

For example, the acute disease that is seen when a bacterial infection spreads from otitis media to cause suppurative meningoencephalitis [8]. We now know that some diseases result from chronic insidious infections and that this is particularly true within the relatively protected confines of the CNS. In addition, progressively more diseases are being identified that, although being associated with the presence of a particular pathogen, require a number of other factors to occur concurrently before disease becomes apparent. For these diseases to develop, there has to be a specific interaction between the infectious organism, host factors (especially genetics affecting the immune system), and the environment.",

Serologic surveys have been largely responsible for recognizing the role of infectious organisms in this type of disease. After detecting a serologic relation, it is then possible to use more complex molecular biology techniques to detect the pathogen within a particular individual or particular pathologic lesion. It is highly likely that it will be by using this type of approach that the causes for many feline CNS disorders will be found (eg, Borna disease [BD]).",

This allows for rapid spread of disease, not only among human beings but from human beings to other species. In addition, as the global human population increases, the demand for housing means that previously unexplored habitats are being developed, new pathogens are being exposed, and old pathogens are finding new hosts. There are a number of examples of infections that have crossed between species because of altered population dynamics, and many of them involve feline species. Examples include canine distemper virus (CDV), which is now causing disease in a number of large feline species, particularly lions in the Serengeti [9], but has not yet been detected in domestic cats [10]; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by a coronavirus that seems to have been passed from civet cats in China to human beings (although the civet cat is not actually a feline species) [11], [12]; avian influenza virus (H5N1), which has killed domestic and captive wild felids in Thailand [13]; and West Nile virus (WNV), which is now present in the United States, being spread by mosquitoes to many wild and captive birds as well as to horses and humans beings [14].",

This is because experimental studies have shown that it is relatively easy to transmit WNV to cats by a mosquito bite or orally via consumption of infected prey [15]. Experimental cats in one study showed only mild nonneurologic signs [15]. This does not mean that WNV cannot cause neurologic disease in cats, however. This is because dogs in the same study remained perfectly healthy [15] but have been shown to develop encephalitis and myocarditis in a separate study [16]. To date, domestic cats tested in New York City have not been found to be seropositive for WNV [17]. Seropositive cats have been identified in the United States, however, and several cases demonstrated seroconversion coincident with neurologic illness (A. Glaser, DVM, PhD, Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, personal communication, 2004). The potential role that WNV may play in feline neurologic disease requires further investigation.",

It is important to note that this virus cannot be excluded on the basis of negative serology. This is because several studies have failed to detect antibody in some virus-positive individuals [27], [33], and in one report, approximately 20% of cats naturally infected with FIV were antibody-negative [33]. Although the reason for this is unknown, it has been suggested that some cats were tested early in the course of infection, before the development of an antibody response. These cats are unlikely to show CNS disease. Alternatively, some cats may have been tested late in the disease, once antibody levels had fallen, along with the terminal decline of the immune system [27]. Other factors may also play a role, because some cats fail to produce a detectable antibody response to FIV at any time during infection [33]. Therefore, to confirm that a cat is not infected with FIV, it may be necessary to perform PCR on a blood or CSF sample or PCR or immunohistochemistry on brain sections collected postmortem [32].",

Antibodies to St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, Tenshaw virus, Snowshoe hare virus, Jamestown Canyon virus, and Powassan virus have been found in free-living cats, indicating previous subclinical infections [45], [46], [47]. Experimental infections have been documented with Near Eastern equine encephalitis virus [48], [49], Powassan virus [46], and Rift Valley fever virus in kittens [47]. Many of these viruses have a wide geographic distribution, including the United States and Europe, and some are endemically present in wild mammal populations to which free-living cats may become exposed [50].

Experimentally, BDV can also be transmitted to birds, rodents, and monkeys, and it is likely that the host range includes all warm-blooded animals and birds [52], [58], [60], [61]. The exact geographic distribution of the virus is uncertain, but serologic evidence has documented infection in Europe, the United States, and Asia [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70].",

Based on serologic surveys or surveys looking for BDV RNA in peripheral blood samples, it is clear that BDV infection is usually asymptomatic. The prevalence of seropositivity increases steadily with age in cats [72], [73] and, interestingly, seems to be higher in cats that are also FIV antibody-positive [68], [74]. In the United Kingdom, 6% of cats with no evidence of CNS disease have antibodies against BDV [65], as do 9% of ill cats submitted for FIV, FeLV, and FIP virus testing (D.A. Harbour, PhD, unpublished results from 654 cat blood samples, 1999). In Japan, 13% to 22% of healthy randomly selected cats are seropositive for BDV [62], [75]. Antibodies against BDV or BDV RNA are seen most frequently in cats with neurologic disease, however. When cats with undefined neurologic disorders were investigated, 13% were found to be BDV antibody-positive in Germany [76] compared with 35% in the United Kingdom [65] and 67% in Japan [77]. Although most documented cases of feline BD have originated from northern and central Europe, probable cases have been seen in many other countries [65] (see section on nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis of unknown cause). Given the difficulty in making a premortem diagnosis (and even a postmortem diagnosis) and the low index of suspicion, it is likely that BD is underdiagnosed.",

Although a wide age range of cats may be affected (from 5 months to 11 years of age), young adults seem to be most at risk [54], [78], [79]. Disease is characterized by behavioral and motor disturbances resulting from meningoencephalomyelitis. In experimental infections, clinical signs included protrusion of the third eyelid, behavioral changes, circling, ataxia, and tremors [72]. Natural infections may present with progressive hind limb ataxia, loss of appetite, fever, increased affection toward the owner, unusual staring expression, apparent pain over the sacrum, increased salivation, aggression, an inability to retract claws, seizures, focal or generalized pruritus, hypersensitivity to light and sound, or constipation [76], [78], [79]. Occasional atypical cases have been seen, for example, causing muscle fasciculation and proprioceptive defects (without evidence of encephalitis) [95]. Disease is usually progressive, and mortality rates are high because affected cats usually warrant euthanasia within a week to 6 months [78], [79]. Cats that survive the initial episode may remain chronically infected or may experience recurrent episodes of disease [72]. Although fatal BD is seen most commonly as a rare isolated event, it can occasionally occur as a large outbreak, where as many as 30 to 40 cases may be seen in a week [78].",

Unfortunately, detection of serum antibodies is not reliable. This is because although raised serum antibodies are present in some cats with BD (\u223c40%) [76], particularly those with acute disease, others may be antibody-negative, particularly if they have subacute or chronic disease [54], [62], [65], [72], [79]. Although clinical signs of BD tend to develop at the same time that BDV RNA can be detected within the peripheral blood [89], this does not necessarily reflect the extent of the viral load in the CNS [60], and asymptomatic cats can also be positive [75]. Routine serum biochemistry and hematology are generally unremarkable, although some cats may show a leukopenia, and mild elevations in glucose or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels may also occur [72], [78]. CSF analysis may show a leukocytosis with mononuclear cells predominating, protein levels may be increased (Table 3) [78], and antibodies to BDV may be detected [92].",

After finding that the cats were seropositive for BDV and then performing experimental transmission studies, however, subsequent publications from the same authors determined that these cases had actually been caused by BDV [72], [79]. It has therefore been suggested that BDV may be responsible for more of these cases. Although this remains a possibility, it is also possible that there are a number of other previously unrecognized viruses. For this reason, it is important that these cases be fully studied before any causal relation can be proven (for diagnostic methods, see section on prevalence of neurological disease in cats and the preponderance of cases with no known cause) [6], [7]. In addition, because BDV can be found in the CNS of some clinically normal individuals [65], its presence, per se, within the CNS of a cat showing neurologic disease does not prove that it is the cause of the disorder.",

Some of these, including rabies virus, Aujeszky's disease virus, and Newcastle disease virus, have been ruled out on the basis of somewhat differing pathologic findings [109]. It has also been suggested that the condition may be an unusual manifestation of FPV infection [109], [112]. Although FPV classically causes cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens, with degeneration of the germinal and Purkinje cells [122], [123], it has occasionally been associated with inflammatory lesions within the brain, leukodystrophic lesions, neuronal degeneration, and gliosis of the spinal cord gray matter or spinal cord demyelination [124]. In addition, in FPV-vaccinated cats, FPV infection can still cause leukopenia and nonregenerative anemia [125]. Interestingly, 2 of 33 cases of clinical BD were seen in kittens that came from litters in which the rest of the litter had died of FPV [78]. Other suggested causes include FeLV [126] and arborviruses (see section on rare or experimental infectious causes of CNS disease in cats).",

It was an interesting case because it was found to have massive neuronal infection with BDV but lacked inflammatory change [95]. This poses an intriguing question as to whether this case was incorrectly attributed to BDV (with the BDV representing a striking but clinically insignificant finding), while also raising the possibility that most of the rest of the cases could actually be attributable to a second variant of BDV infection.",

In addition, some perinatal infections can result in lasting CNS infection without the development of antibodies (circulating within the blood stream or within the CNS) or encephalitis, but they can still be associated with neurologic disease [95]. This has been seen with BDV infection of some rodents, where infected individuals develop subtle behavioral changes and defects in memory and learning [130], [131].

It is believed to have resulted from the inclusion of scrapie-infected sheep carcasses into feedstuffs for cattle [150]. This resulted in a change to the agent's pathogenicity, making it more infectious to cattle (and cats). Cattle succumbing to BSE were then included in cattle feed, thereby amplifying the transmission and spreading the infection [150], [151]. Once this epidemiologic pattern had been determined, the feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants was banned. Since then, the incidence of BSE first plateaued and then fell [152], [153].",

It probably entered the feline population of the United Kingdom in contaminated pet food, and the temporal distribution of cases supports this hypothesis. Since its recognition in 1990, approximately 90 cases of FSE have been confirmed, mostly between 1990 and 1994 (J.W. Wilesmith, BVSc, PhD, J. Spriopoulos, DVM, PhD, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK, personal communication on confirmed cases up to the end of 2001, 2004) (\nFig. 1). In addition, retrospective study of brain tissue from cats with neurologic disease failed to find cases of FSE before 1990 [1], [154]. Although, like BSE, the peak of FSE seems to have passed, occasional cases are still seen (see Fig. 1) [153]. Because few domestic cats are subject to routine postmortem examination, it is likely that the total number of FSE cases has been underestimated.",

All TSE diseases are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal isoform of a host-coded protein, the prion protein (PrP). PrP is found in all animals; it is a cell surface glycoprotein of unknown significance. Although the PrP isolated from normal individuals (PrPc) and the PrP isolated from TSE-infected individuals (PrP-res) have the same amino acid sequence and secondary structure, PrPc is totally degraded by proteinase K, whereas PrP-res resists digestion. Once present, PrP-res is believed to induce additional copies of itself by interacting with normal PrPc. In doing this, PrP-res acts as an infectious agent [156]. Once the host-coded PrPc has been transformed to PrP-res, it accumulates in fibrils (scrapie-associated fibrils [SAFs]), and this eventually leads to disease [135]. Because the process is slow, however, all TSEs have prolonged incubation periods. More detailed information on TSE pathogenesis is reviewed elsewhere [157], [158], [159]. Because PrP is host-coded, the accumulation of SAFs induces no immune response [160], [161].",

Affected cats present with progressive hind limb ataxia; increased aggression or affection; hyperesthesia to touch, sound, or light; altered grooming patterns; increased salivation; dilated pupils with an unusual staring expression; polyphagia or polydipsia; abnormal head posture; muscle fasciculations; or an inability to retract their claws [132], [133], [134], [148], [154]. Behavioral changes have usually been noted first, followed by progressive locomotor dysfunction. The cats tend to show ataxia, with dysmetria or hypermetria, which often leads to an erratic crouching gait [134], [148]. They also show an inability to judge distances. The disease is generally progressive, warranting euthanasia within 8 to 12 weeks of the onset of clinical signs [134].",

Diagnosis of FSE is usually made by histopathologic examination of the brain (formalin-fixed tissue) and ultrastructural detection of SAFs in brain extracts (fresh-frozen brain or spinal cord) [162].

Thankfully, with the introduction of strict laws regulating the slaughter and rendering of ruminants and the overall decline in the incidence of BSE, the possibility of the BSE agent continuing to be included in the food chain is extremely small. Because the incubation period is long and variable, however, we are likely to continue to see new cases of vCJD in the United Kingdom for a few years yet to come. That said, the increasing prevalence of CWD in deer and elk in the United States is of concern, and the potential for this TSE to be transmitted to human beings (or cats) is still to be determined [141].",
