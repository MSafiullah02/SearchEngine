These viruses evolve through genetic mutations and resulting antigenic changes, what allows them to evade host immunity. Influenza vaccines have to be updated periodically in order to be effective in the following season. Hence, the constant need for seasonal vaccination. As it takes approximately 6 months to produce influenza vaccines, recommendations need to be done in advance. The World Health Organization (WHO) convenes annual meetings in February and September each year to establish the composition of influenza vaccine for the forthcoming season in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively (Chambers et al. 2015; WHO 2014a; Webster et al. 2013 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 711, "end": 733, "text": "(Chambers et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 734, "end": 744, "text": "WHO 2014a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 745, "end": 764, "text": "Webster et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The 2014/2015 influenza epidemic season in Poland started in week 5 (January/ February) of 2015 and continued until week 17 (April) of 2015.

The 2014/2015 morbidity in children aged 0-4 years was twice as much as it had been in the former epidemic season. The vast majority of infections in this group of children was induced by influenza-like viruses (67.2 %). In both seasons, in the case of influenza-like viruses, the predominant virus was RSV. Infections caused by other respiratory viruses occurred sporadically. Influenza cases were caused mainly by influenza type A (83.2 %). The proportion of influenza B was significantly higher in the 2014/2015 season than that in the previous season where it amounted to 1.2 % of all influenza confirmations (Bednarska et al. 2015) . While comparing data from Poland and Europe, it is apparent that the proportion of circulating viruses of influenza type A and B remains similar. In Europe and the whole world alike, the dominant strain was A/H3N2/, but it co-circulated with influenza A/H1N1/pdm09. The predominance of the A/H3N2/ strain also was noted in Poland, even taking into account the fact that not all the specimens tested within the SENTINEL and non-SENTINEL influenza surveillance were subtyped (Broberg et al. 2015; ECDC/WHO 2015; WHO 2015; Rolfes et al. 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 866, "end": 889, "text": "(Bednarska et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1386, "text": "(Broberg et al. 2015;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1401, "text": "ECDC/WHO 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1411, "text": "WHO 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1430, "text": "Rolfes et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the 2014/2015 season, antigenic drift of the subtype A/H3N2/ decreased the effectiveness of vaccine against influenza.
