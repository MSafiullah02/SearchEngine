Simultaneously, enormous efforts were made to stockpile personal protective equipment (PPE) and to establish policies regarding its use. Within the department of surgery, these challenges required leadership to form new workgroups and reporting structures, establish clear communication strategies, redefine clinical activities for the faculty, and modify the workloads of trainees.

Avoidance of blanket policies in lieu of careful and frequent analysis of the multiple factors is needed. These factors include operating room capacity, bed availability, equipment, supplies and PPE availability, ventilator availability, staffing, blood availability, and assessment of the national, regional, and local conditions and trends that may affect the magnitude of the surge. Two weeks after the initial policy was implemented, guidance was given to tighten the window for essential cases from 3 to 1 month based on modeling for the surge and limited resources.

Telemedicine was implemented across the system, and consults and follow-up visits were transitioned as individually appropriate. Two following modalities of telemedicine were utilized: telephone based visits or video visits. An unintended, but positive, consequence of this rapid shift and adoption of telemedicine forced the institution to quickly develop protocols and assistance with telemedicine operations, billing, workflow, compliance, information technology, and equipment.

Specifically, surgeons were asked about their comfort level and privileging to manage critically ill patients and take emergency general surgery or trauma call. When the surveys were returned, surgeons were placed into different tiers to be called upon when needed during the surge. Tier 1 represented those who were comfortable with these skills and were currently credentialed to perform them. Tier 2 represented a pool of surgeons who were reasonably comfortable with ventilator management and ICU care but were not currently credentialed to do so, and Tier 3 represented the pool of surgeon who were not comfortable with these skills and were not credentialed to perform them.

            "text": "One of the issues that has created the most stress among the faculty and trainees leading up to the surge was the availability of PPE. Policies were established early to help preserve PPE, particularly N95 masks, and to avoid overuse or waste when use was not warranted. Aerosolizing and high-risk procedures were identified and included oral-maxillofacial surgery, thoracic, surgery, and head/neck and dental interventions with the intent to disrupt or break the mucosal membrane in the oral cavity, airway, and/or pulmonary tract, and cause prolonged exposure to aerosolization and/or droplets. It was recommended that N95 masks only be used for these aerosolizing procedures. At the point of care, the default was for clinicians to proceed with an abundance of caution. Continuous messaging and reinforcement are needed to avoid excessive use of PPE early in the \u201ccurve.\u201d Part of preparations for the surge was to include updates from the medical director of supply chain (SB) to provide real time data regarding our PPE inventory, especially N95 masks.",

While it is still fairly unique for a health system to have a medical director for their supply chain, it proved to be an important part of the messaging plan to clinicians and helped alleviate faculty stress regarding the PPE planning. For systems without a supply chain medical director, we strongly encourage some engagement from a supply chain representative to directly answer questions and address faculty around PPE issues.",

            "text": "Once non-essential surgical procedures were postponed, operative cases were placed in a \u201cdepot\u201d to be rescheduled after normal operations resumed. New teleconsults that would eventually require surgery were similarly placed in a depot for the schedulers. This process has led to hundreds of cases accruing that will need to be scheduled when the operating room schedule returns to normal. This \u201csecond surge\u201d of elective cases will present its own set of logistic challenges and requires early planning to facilitate care of surgical patients once the COVID-19 surge has passed. Adding operating room staff and extending operating room hours will likely be required to accommodate the large volume of cases that will be rescheduled after the crisis. Additionally, the supply chain must ensure that the necessary equipment and supplies will be available for elective cases after the crisis is over. Planning with perioperative leadership is needed to prepare for these cases. A key facet of this plan is reassuring current personnel of their worth and value when their specialized services may not be needed during the crisis planning and surge. These personnel, who performed admirably during \u201cnormal\u201d times, will be called upon greatly in the \u201cback to business\u201d phase after the crisis. Our institution has developed redeployment and volunteer opportunities for several employees, as well as a disaster leave policy to retain key members of our team.",
