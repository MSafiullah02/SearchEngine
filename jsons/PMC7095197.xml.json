When ARDS occurs in the setting of multisystem organ failure, mortality rates over 60% have been reported, with significant morbidity in 50% of survivors [1\u20133]. Endotoxin is produced by gram negative bacteria and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS, which is the commonest cause of ALI/ARDS, and has the worst outcome [4\u20136]. Endotoxin may also contribute to ALI/ARDS from other causes, such as major surgery, where alterations in mucosal permeability may permit access of gut-derived endotoxins to the systemic circulation [7]. Endotoxin binds the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), which activates the innate immune response [8].",

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyses the dismutation of superoxide and is a key component of the antioxidant defences in the lung. Pharmacologic strategies to directly augment the lung antioxidant defences via exogenous SOD administration have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models [11\u201313], but have not translated to the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to overexpress the gene encoding for superoxide in the lung epithelium, using intrapulmonary delivery of viral vectors encoding the gene.",

The reduction in alveolar neutrophil infiltration by EC-SOD overexpression may be due, at least in part, to the reduction in alveolar concentrations of the potent neutrophil chemoattractant CINC-1. Of importance, there was no evidence to suggest that the viral vector itself worsened the inflammatory response to endotoxin. This is significant given concerns regarding the potential of viral vectors to produce a host immune response, a potentially deleterious effect in the setting of a generalized pro-inflammatory state such as ALI/ARDS.",

EC-SOD almost completely attenuated the endotoxin-induced decrement in these indices as evidence by the fact that these indices were not different from those in uninjured animals. In contrast, administration of empty vector did not exert any beneficial effects compared to administration of vehicle alone. EC-SOD overexpression also reduced the extent of histologic injury, as evidenced by a greater preservation of alveolar airspace, and reduced alveolar tissue, compared to animals that received empty vector or vehicle alone.",

            "text": "There are a number of limitations in regard to this study. Firstly, this study involved the administration of vector prior to the onset of lung injury. In the clinical setting, lung injury is generally well established at presentation. It is not clear what effect EC-SOD overexpression might have if introduced after the onset of lung injury. However, there are certain settings, such as major cardiovascular or intra-abdominal surgery, where an insult, such as the development of endotoxemia, is a frequent, and relatively predictable occurrence [7]. A safe, low toxicity intervention, if proven effective in these settings, might confer substantial clinical benefit. Secondly, intratracheal delivery of transgene following the development of ALI/ARDS may be difficult, particularly where lung units are collapsed or filled with exudate, reducing the therapeutic utility of intrapulmonary delivered therapies. It is reassuring in these studies that endotoxin injury did not adversely affect transgene expression or activity. Lastly, ALI and ARDS generally have time courses significantly longer than the 24 h assessed by this model. Differences between groups that were not apparent at 24 h might be very clear after a number of days. Further experiments with a longer observation period, and which assess outcome, might be useful in giving insights into the likely clinical impact of pulmonary gene therapy for ARDS.",
