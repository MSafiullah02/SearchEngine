The strength of this system is illustrated by the fact that, despite some temporary discomfort like a common cold or diarrhea, most viral infections will not cause major harm to the healthy immunocompetent host. To achieve this, the immune system is equipped with a wide array of pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent coordinated type I IFN response orchestrated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). The production of type I IFN subtypes by dendritic cells (DCs), but also other cells is crucial for the execution of many antiviral processes. Despite this coordinated response, morbidity and mortality are still common in viral disease due to the ability of viruses to exploit the weaknesses of the immune system. Viruses successfully evade immunity and infection can result in aberrant immune responses. However, these weaknesses also open opportunities for improvement via clinical interventions as can be seen in current vaccination and antiviral treatment programs. The application of IFNs, Toll-like receptor ligands, DCs, and antiviral proteins is now being investigated to further limit viral infections.

For this, immune cells are equipped with different groups of receptors, which are able to sense microbial intruders including viruses. These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are fundamentally different from host structures. One of the first discovered and best characterized PRRs are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [7-10], which are mostly present on antigen-presenting cells like macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) [8, 9] , but also on non-immune cells like fibroblasts and epithelial cells [10] . These transmembrane receptors are located on the cell surface or at the endosome [7, [9] [10] [11] . The cell surface-located TLRs recognize mainly lipids and proteins from bacteria and yeasts [10] .

In general, pDCs endocytose the virus and subsequently Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and/or TLR9 is stimulated. Interferon response factor 7 (IRF7) is activated and induces transcription of IFNa/b. Besides execution of many antiviral functions, autocrine signaling via the interferon a/b receptor (IFNAR) also induces more type I IFN production. In contrast, infection of or endocytosis by cDCs results in activation of the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors, TLR3, and TLR8. Accordingly, IRF3 and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) facilitate transcription of IFNb and proinflammatory cytokines. Via IFNAR, IRF7 is activated and induces production of type IFNa/b.

Also, this endosomal location of the TLRs probably serves to ensure tolerance for \"self\" molecules and to promote ligand accessibility [10, 14] . Interestingly, in addition to the well-known lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria, cell surface TLRs have also been associated with viral recognition. TLR4 has been shown to recognize the fusion protein of RSV [10, 20] .

IRF3 is essential for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and IFNb (the first wave IFN) and is constitutively expressed, not only in cDCs but in most cell types [10,54]. Next, because of autocrine or paracrine signaling through the interferon-a/b receptor (IFNAR), IRF7 is activated, leading to the production of all type I IFNs including the various IFNa subtypes (the second wave IFN) [55, 56] . Alternatively, in pDCs IRF7 is constitutively expressed and activated immediately after stimulation of TLR7 or TLR9, and thus no prior phosphorylation of IRF3 or autocrine/paracrine signaling is required ( Figure 1) [48,52,57-60].

Although the pDC produces mainly IFNa, the cDC induces a pro-inflammatory profile in which nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) is activated for the production of TNF-a and IL-6 [64]. More importantly, IL-12 is produced ( Figure 1 ). This cytokine augments the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and also induces the production of the immunoregulatory cytokine IFNg by T and NK cells [65] .

Thus, the increased resistance to the antiviral effects of IFN enhances viral replication and evokes an aberrant proinflammatory response characterized by high levels of cytokines and chemokines, which induces the pulmonary injury observed in H5N1 patients. Likewise, the devastating effects of an HIV infection may also results from such a combination. HIV infection results in progressive immune deficiency, impaired adaptive responses, low CD4 T cell counts and increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections. One of the earliest findings during the AIDS epidemic was a deficient IFNa production in HIVinfected patients. Next to a lower number of IFNproducing cells, also each cell produced less IFNa in response to HIV [113, 114] . The decrease in IFNa can be due to the Vpr protein of HIV, which strongly inhibits type I IFN production by pDCs [115] . In addition, the effects of IFNa are antagonized by the HIV protein Vpu, which induces degradation of the restriction factor BST2 [79,116]. However, during the chronic phase of HIV infection, it is hypothesized that IFNa contributes to the decline of the immune system by inducing apoptosis of CD4 T cells. Because of the non-infectious interaction between the HIV-bound gp120 protein and the CD4 receptor on pDCs, IFNa is produced and this results in killing (possibly by pDCs) of uninfected CD4 T cells [114] [115] [116] [117] .

Although RIG-I can respond to both positive and negative strand RNA viruses, MDA5 senses mainly picornaviruses like rhinovirus and poliovirus [29,30]. Earlier data suggested that MDA5 preferentially binds long dsRNA (picornaviruses), whereas shorter fragments of dsRNA and other specific nucleotide sequences are sensed by RIG-I [30,31]. However, some viruses can be detected by both receptors [29]. Also, the recently discovered receptor DAI is important for intracellular detection of viral DNA [32,33]. C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) also belong to the large family of PRRs. CLRs are present on DCs and recognize carbohydrate structures present on pathogens [34,35] and are especially important for induction of antigen presentation to T cells, but also in modulating TLR responses [36]. NLRs, a group of cytoplasmic proteins formerly thought to detect only bacterial PAMPs, also sense RNA [37-39] and DNA viruses [33,40,41]. This induces the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 via the inflammasome, a complex composed of NLRs, and leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection [42,43].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Mx1) proteins target viral nucleocapsidlike structures [73] and mediate vesicle trafficking in the ER to effectively trap essential viral components and subsequently degrade them [74,75]. The enzyme 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) accumulates after signaling through the IFNAR by type I IFN. When exposed to dsRNA, this enzyme gains activity that eventually leads to the activation of ribonuclease L (RNAseL), concomitantly enabling cleavage of cellular and viral RNAs [69,76]. Protein kinase R (PKR) is also initially inactive. Type I IFN induces accumulation of PKR and dsRNA activates PKR to inhibit translation [77]. For a more detailed overview of the ISG function, we would like to refer to the excellent review recently published by Sadler et al. [69].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "[90,91]. For example, PRR signaling can be suppressed by inhibition of downstream signaling or by sequestration of typical viral nucleic acids like dsRNA [90]. In this way, viral recognition is inhibited. Alternatively, viruses interfere with the production of type I IFN by targeting the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. The proteins involved in IRF activation are inactivated or IRF mimics are synthesized, which compete with the host IRFs [90,92,93]. Also, binding of IFN to IFNAR can be prevented by a virallyencoded type I IFN receptor, as observed during vaccinia virus infection [94,95]. Finally, the antiviral or immuno-regulatory effects of type I IFN are inhibited by targeting various ISGs and thereby facilitating viral replication and preventing immune recognition [96-99].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Viral inhibition of the type I IFN pathway", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>General target Specific target </td><td>Virus examples </td><td>References\n</td></tr><tr><td>PRR signaling almost all proteins </td><td>Ebola, influenza, HCV </td><td>[90,91]\n</td></tr><tr><td>Transcription IRF3, IRF7, </td><td>Paramyxoviruses, Rabies </td><td>[90,92,93]\n</td></tr><tr><td>Cytokine receptors IFNAR </td><td>Vaccinia </td><td>[94,95]\n</td></tr><tr><td>ISGs ISG15, mx1, OAS1, PKR, for example </td><td>SARS, influenza, HCV </td><td>[96-99]\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "10.1073/pnas.0400937101 0400937101 [pii] 16.
