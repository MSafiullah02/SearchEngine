This requires virus-specific primary antibodies, which may not available in case of a novel virus.

Two TEM techniques are generally used for this purpose: negative staining on an electron microscopic grid coated with a support film, or (ultra) thin-section TEM of infected cells, fixed, pelleted, dehydrated and embedded in epoxy plastic. Negative staining can be conducted on highly concentrated suspensions of purified virus or on cell culture supernatants. For some viruses, TEM can be conducted on contents of skin lesions (e.g., poxviruses and herpesviruses) or on concentrated stool material (rotaviruses and noroviruses). For successful detection of viruses in ultrathin sections of infected cells, at least 70% of cells must be infected, so either high multiplicity of infection (MOI) or rapid virus multiplication is required.",

Family Reoviridae includes two subfamilies, Spinareovirinae and Sedoreovirinae, according to morphology of virion surface which can be visualized in negatively stained preparations of purified viruses. Virions of viruses assigned to the Spinareovirinae have short flat spikes or turrets. In Fako virus (unassigned; probable genus Dinovernavirus), recently isolated from mosquitoes in Cameroon [29] , these turrets are ~7 nm tall and ~15 nm wide ( Figure 6A ). In the Sedoreovirinae, virions are devoid of spikes but can display round surface capsomere subunits ~7 nm in diameter ( Figure 6B ). Reoviruses reproduce in cytoplasmic inclusions -virus factories, or viroplasms which appear in ultrathin sections as medium density masses composed of fine fibrils and granules and containing virus particles of different stages of maturity and empty shells ( Figures 6C,D and 7A ). In coltiviruses (genus Coltivirus) and orbiviruses (genus Orbivirus), virus factories are often associated with randomly distributed fibrils and/or microtubules as demonstrated by F.A. Murphy [58, 63] . ",

            "text": "In ultrathin sections of infected cells virions of arthropod-borne reoviruses appear as spherical particles 45-70 nm in diameter with central dense cores ( Figure 6C ,D and Figure 7A ). Family Reoviridae includes two subfamilies, Spinareovirinae and Sedoreovirinae, according to morphology of virion surface which can be visualized in negatively stained preparations of purified viruses. Virions of viruses assigned to the Spinareovirinae have short flat spikes or turrets. In Fako virus (unassigned; probable genus Dinovernavirus), recently isolated from mosquitoes in Cameroon [29] , these turrets are~7 nm tall and~15 nm wide ( Figure 6A ). In the Sedoreovirinae, virions are devoid of spikes but can display round surface capsomere subunits~7 nm in diameter ( Figure 6B ). Reoviruses reproduce in cytoplasmic inclusions -virus factories, or viroplasms which appear in ultrathin sections as medium density masses composed of fine fibrils and granules and containing virus particles of different stages of maturity and Figure 7A ). In coltiviruses (genus Coltivirus) and orbiviruses (genus Orbivirus), virus factories are often associated with randomly distributed fibrils and/or microtubules as demonstrated by F.A. Murphy [58, 63] . ",

They appear to be very common and widespread in insect populations on different continents as isolates have been obtained from pools of mosquitoes and sandflies collected in Israel, North and South America, Africa, and Indonesia. In negatively stained preparations of Piura virus, isolated from Culex sp. mosquitoes in Peru, spherical particles with diameters of~45 nm and~55 nm were found. The striking feature of negevirus infection of C6/36 mosquito cells are the cytopathic effects -enormous expansions of perinuclear space -a granular endoplasmic reticulum system which becomes filled with vesicles and/or microtubules ( Figure 8C , Figure 9A ,B andFigure 10A). They have a diameter of 20-25 nm but can be of different lengths. The shortest can resemble a rice grain in morphology and can be arranged in rosettes in cross-sections of ER. Others can be very long, reaching up to several micrometers ( Figures 8C and 9A,B) . Expanded perinuclear space can occupy almost the whole cytoplasm of the cell. Some negeviruses cause long protrusions of the nucleus and deep invaginations of perinuclear membranes leading to the fragmentation of the nucleus ( Figure 9B ). Another peculiarity of negevirus infection of C6/36 cells is the formation of cytopathic vacuoles with spherule-like structures 45-55 nm in diameter at the inner periphery of their limiting membrane ( Figure 8C,D) . These vacuoles can reach 1.4 \u00b5m in diameter and are morphologically similar to type 1 cytopathic vacuoles in alphaviruses. They have been found in all 10 described negeviruses [49] and later in many others that have not yet been fully characterized. Their role in negevirus replication is not known. ",

Three viruses have also been observed to infect the same culture: Bontag Baru virus (unclassified; probable genus Alphamesonivirus), an unknown flavivirus and an unknown rhabdovirus, the latter budding into an ER cistern occupied by a flavivirus virion. It is most likely that these viruses originate from different individual mosquitoes in the pool, but the possibility of a co-infection of one mosquito with several different viruses cannot be excluded.",
