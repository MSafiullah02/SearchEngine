Twenty-two (69%) biopsies from common colds patients but none of the five control biopsies showed reactivity for human rhinovirus 14 antisense probe. The signal was detected both in the respiratory epithelium and in mucosal inflammatory cells. In situ hybridization of the middle turbinate tissue yielded more positive results than RT-PCR (47%) or virus culture (34%) assayed from nasopharyngeal aspirates, but no statistical significant differences were observed (P \u00bc 0.265, P \u00bc 0.425, respectively). The results indicated that in situ hybridization procedure was slightly more sensitive than PCR assays and classical culture for the detection of human rhinovirus infection of upper respiratory tract. However, in situ hybridization procedure appeared to be an interesting methodology to investigate the physiopathology of respiratory tract infection by rhinoviruses.",

            "text": "At the beginning of a rhinovirus infection, viruses invade the nasopharynx and interact with epithelial cells. Rhinoviruses are recovered from the nasopharynx earlier, more frequently, and longer than from more anterior sites in nasal cavities [Winther et al., 1986; Arruda et al., 1995] . Although the initial event in cold production is viral infection of the nasal epithelia, morphologic studies have not detected significant changes in the lymphocyte content of the nasal mucosa during rhinovirus colds and nasal biopsy studies have shown little, if any, cell damage [Winther, 1994] . Rhinovirus replication cycle time in humans is similar to that in cell culture and some symptoms begin within 12 hr of exposure [Harris and Gwaltney, 1996] . Virus titres peak 2-3 days after infection and may persist at low levels for up to 3 weeks [Winther et al., 1986] . Because rhinovirus does not cause a marked destruction of the epithelial lining, infection has considered to be limited only certain areas in the nasal epithelium. This has been confirmed in the few earlier experimental studies using in situ hybridization, where rhinoviruses were shown to cause only focal infection of the nasal epithelium [Bruce et al., 1990; Arruda et al., 1991 Arruda et al., , 1995 Bardin et al., 1994] . In contrast to the above studies, we found in our earlier study on patients with acute maxillary sinusitis a large number of sinus epithelial cells positive for rhinovirus by in situ hybridization [Pitk\u00e4 ranta et al., 2001] . These findings led us to study middle turbinate biopsies from patients with naturally occurring common colds by in situ hybridization to further evaluate the course of natural rhinovirus infection, its pathogenesis, and spread of rhinoviruses through the respiratory tract.",

From those 200 patients, middle turbinate biopsies were obtained from 32 patients (21 female and 11 male, mean age 24 years) on day 7. From nine of these patients, middle turbinate biopsies were also obtained on day 1. The samples were collected during a 10-month period. The study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee of the Turku University Hospital. A signed informed consent was obtained from each patient. The patients contacted the study physician within 24 to 48 hr after the onset of symptoms of the common cold. For inclusion in the study, patients had to self-diagnose the common cold based on their earlier experience of symptoms. In addition, the study physician confirmed clinical evidence of acute rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and/or sore throat. Patients with tonsillitis and with previous histories of allergic rhinitis, any chronic illness, or use of regular medication were excluded. Middle turbinate biopsy was undertaken with atraumatic Gerritsma biopsy forceps from the mucosa of anterior part of middle turbinate. The specimens were immediately fixed in formalin and stored for later process at room temperature [Fokkens et al., 1988] . Control middle turbinate biopsies were obtained from five adult patients who were admitted to the hospital because of nasal fracture. None of the patients had common cold symptoms. The Otorhinolaryngological Ethical Committee of the Helsinki University Central Hospital accepted the study plan and a signed informed consent was obtained from each of these patients.",

According to the epidemiological studies, rhinovirus shedding in nasal fluid can persist for up to 3 weeks in patients with rhinovirus colds and subclinical infections may occur. Since we did not have a baseline (and post-infection) samples from the patients, we cannot be sure if the higher in situ hybridization detection rates than PCR and culture could be due to non-replicative, perhaps even persistent, rhinovirus infection. Although rhinovirus persistence in upper respiratory track has been described earlier in children [Marin et al., 2000] , the situation in adults may differ from that. In addition, our adult controls were all rhinovirus negative by in situ hybridization. However, the potential persistence of rhinoviruses in upper respiratory track may be important because it could be linked either to the development of bacterial superinfection [Waner, 1994] or to the development of chronic asthma by chronic inflammatory mechanisms as has been suggested [Freymuth et al., 1999; Marin et al., 2000] .",
