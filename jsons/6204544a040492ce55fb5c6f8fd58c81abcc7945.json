Despite 26 these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of human 27 SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is 28 speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins 29 drives diversity. Here, we have identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with 30 some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. 31 Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different 32 infection efficiency in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants.

Structure modeling revealed that the 38 difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the 39 alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular 40 evolution analysis indicates that these residues were under strong positive selection. 41 These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may 42 have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, 43 3 triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. It further proves that R. sinicus is the 44 natural host of SARSr-CoVs. 45 46 4 Importance 47 Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. 48 Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is 49 important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, 50 we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, 51 we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These 52 ACE2 variants support SARS-and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding 53 affinity to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to 54 human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity of spillover to humans. 55 The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV 56 spike protein suggests a long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between 57 them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the 58 prevention of the next SARS-like disease. 59 60 5 Introduction 61 Coronaviruses belong to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily and Coronaviridae 62 family. They are enveloped viruses and contain a positive-sense and single-stranded 63 RNA genome. There are four genera in this subfamily, Alphacoronavirus, 64 Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronavirus and 65 Betacoronavirus are believed to have originated in bats or rodents while 66 Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus in birds (1, 2). Since the beginning of the 67 21 st century, three betacoronaviruses have caused outbreaks of severe pneumonia in 68 humans. These are, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 69 (3-5), the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (6) and the 70 ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (7). 71 The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought back memories of SARS-CoV that 72 occurred 17 years ago in China. SARS is a zoonosis, as demonstrated by the 73 identification of an almost identical coronavirus present in market civets in 74 Guangdong province, China (8). In the following years, genetically diverse 75 SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) were detected or isolated from horseshoe 76 bats from different regions of China and Europe (9-18). Bat SARSr-CoVs share 78-77 96% nucleotide sequence identity with human and civet SARS-CoVs, with the most 78 variable regions encoding the spike protein (S) and accessory protein ORF3 and 8 (17, 79 19). Moreover, we have identified all the building blocks of SARS-CoV in the 80 genome of different bat SARSr-CoVs and suggest that the ancestor of SARS-CoV 81 originated in bats through the recombination of bat SARSr-CoV genomes (17, 19).",

            "text": "The first and essential step of virus infection is cell receptor recognition. The entry 83 of the coronavirus is mediated by specific interactions between the viral S protein and 84 cell surface receptor, followed by fusion between the viral and host membrane. The 85 coronavirus S protein is functionally divided into two subunits, a cell attachment 86 subunit (S1) and a membrane-fusion subunit (S2). The S1 region contains an 87 N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD); both can be used for 88 coronavirus receptor binding (RBD) (20) . For SARS-CoV, its S1-CTD serves as an 89 RBD for binding to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 90 (21). Biochemical and crystal structure analyses have identified a few key residues in 91 the interface between the SARS-CoV S-RBD and human ACE2 (21-23). have a smaller S protein, due to 5, 12, or 13 amino acid deletions (17, 19) . Despite the 96 variations in the RBD, all clade 1 strains can use ACE2 for cell entry, whereas clade 2 97 strains, with deletions cannot (14, 16, 17) . These results suggest that members of 98 clade 1 are likely to be the direct source of SARS-CoV in terms of genome similarity 99 and ACE2 usage. Samples from three provinces (Hubei, Guangdong, and Yunnan) were used for 123 ACE2 amplification, based on the prevalence of bat SARSr-CoVs and tissue sample 124 availability and quality. In addition to previously sequenced bat ACE2 by our group 125 (sample ID 832, 411, and 3357, collected from Hubei, Guangxi, and Yunnan, 126 8 respectively) and others (GenBank accession no. ACT66275; sample collected from 127 Hong Kong), we obtained ACE2 gene sequences from 21 R. sinicus bat individuals: 128 five from Hubei, nine from Guangdong, and seven from Yunnan. The ACE2 129 sequences exhibited 98-100% amino acid (aa) identity within their species and 80-81% 130 aa identity with human ACE2 (Table S1 ). Major variations were observed at the 131 N-terminal region, including in some residues which were previously identified to be 132 in contact with SARS-CoV S-RBD ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 ). Analysis based on 133 nonsynonymous SNPs helped identify eight residues, including 24, 27, 31, 34, 35, 38, 134 41, and 42. The combination of these 8 residues produced eight alleles, including 135 RIESEDYK, LIEFENYQ, RTESENYQ, RIKSEDYQ, QIKSEDYQ, RMTSEDYQ, 136 EMKTKDHQ, and EIKTKDHQ, named allele 1-8, respectively (Fig. 1A) . In 137 addition to the ACE2 genotype data from previous studies (allele 4, 7, and 8), five 138 novel alleles were identified in the R. sinicus populations in this study. Alleles 2 and 4 139 were found in two and three provinces, respectively, whereas the other alleles seemed 140 to be geographically restricted. In summary, three alleles (4, 6, and 8) were found in 141 Guangdong, four (1, 2, 4, and 7) in Yunnan, three (2, 4, and 5) in Hubei, and one each 142 in Guangxi and Hong Kong. Coexistence of four alleles was found in the same bat 143 cave of Yunnan where the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV was found (Fig. 1B) . Taken 144 together, these data suggest that ACE2 variants have been circulating within the R. Similar to our previous report, all four bat SARSr-CoV strains with the same 176 genomic background but different S proteins could use human ACE2 and replicate at 177 similar levels (17). However, there are some differences in how they utilize R. sinicus 178 ACE2s ( Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 ). All test viruses could efficiently use allele 1, 2, 4, 5 for 179 entry. RsWIV1 and RsWIV16, which share an identical RBD, could not use allele 6 180 (sample ID 1434) from Guangdong. Rs4231 and RsSHC014, which share an identical 181 RBD, could not use allele 7 (sample ID 3357) and 8 (sample ID 1438) from Yu nnan 182 and Guangdong, respectively. SARS-CoV-BJ01, which shares high similarity with 183 WIV1 and WIV16 RBD, was able to use same bat ACE2 alleles as Rs4231 and 184 11 RsSHC014 in the pseudotyped infection assay ( Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 ). These results 185 indicate that cell entry was affected by both spike RBD and R. sinicus ACE2 variants. 1434ACE2 (allele 6) was found to bind RsSHC014 and BJ01 but not RsWIV1 RBD; 207 3357ACE2 (allele 7) was found to bind RsWIV1 but not RsSHC014 and BJ01 RBD; 208 5720ACE2 (allele 2) was found to bind all tested RBDs. All tested RBDs had a high 209 binding affinity to human or bat ACE2. BJ01 RBD had a higher binding affinity for 210 human ACE2 than did RsWIV1 and RsSHC014 RBDs (Fig. 3A , E, and I); however, 211 it had a lower binding affinity to bat ACE2 than the two bat SARSr-CoV RBDs ( The four tested spike proteins of bat SARSr-CoV are identical in size and share 227 over 90% aa identity with SARS-CoV, which suggests that these proteins have a 228 similar structure. In this study, we built structural complex models of bat 229 SARSr-CoV-RsWIV1 RBD with R. sinicus ACE2 3357 (allele 7) and RsSHC014 230 RBD with R. sinicus ACE2 1434 (allele 6), in concordance with the results of the 231 binding affinity assay between SARS-CoV RBD and human ACE2 (Fig. 4) . 232 Compared with the contact residues in the interface between SARS-CoV RBD and In R. sinicus ACE2-1434, we found a threonine at 31, unlike human ACE2, which 247 has a lysine at this position (Fig. 4) . Therefore, both RsWIV1 and RsSHC014 RBD had a lower binding affinity 268 to human ACE2 than did BJ01, but they both showed a higher binding affinity with Table 1) , 17 of 298 those were found to be located on the RBD region, which faces its receptor ACE2, 299 according to the crystal structure (Fig. S5) . Moreover, five of those (442, 472, 479, 300 480, and 487), present in the SARS-CoV spike, have been previously identified to 301 have a significant impact on binding affinity to human ACE2 (Fig. 4 (24, 27, 31, 34, 35, 38, 41, and 42) correspond to 306 the residues in human ACE2, which were previously identified to be involved in 307 18 direct contact with the human SARS-CoV spike protein (Fig. 4, Fig. S5 ) (32). We also 308 analyzed the ACE2 gene of Rhinolophus affinis (R. affinis), which has been reported 309 to carry SARSr-CoV occasionally (15). Used an alignment of 23 ACE2 gene 310 sequences from R. affinis obtained in this study, we found that R. affinis ACE2 was 311 more conserved between different individuals in the entire coding region than R. 312 sinicus ACE2 (Fig. S6) and no obvious positive selection sites were observed (data ",

Previous results have indicated that the C-terminal domains of 103 ACE2 from different origins are relatively well conserved, whereas the N-terminal 104 7 domains show much more diversity across species (25). Previously, we have shown 105 that SARS-CoV can utilize ACE2 derived from Myotis daubentonii and R. sinicus; 106 minor mutations in the RBD-binding site could convert ACE2 from being 107 unsusceptible to susceptible to SARS-CoV binding (26, 27). As all bat SARSr-CoV 108 belonging to clade 1 can utilize ACE2 and have been isolated from R. sinicus, we 109 asked whether variations in ACE2 of R. sinicus could contribute to the diversity of bat 110 SARSr-CoV. 111 Here, we have investigated the polymorphism of R. sinicus ACE2 genes and 112 assessed their susceptibility and binding affinity to different bat SARSr-CoV spike 113 proteins through a combination of molecular evolution analyses, protein affinity 114 assays, and virus infection assays. Our results showed that the diversity of the 115 SARSr-CoV spike protein may experience natural selection pressure from the R. 116 sinicus ACE2 variants; over long periods of co-existence, the SARSr-CoV spike 117 protein may be selected by R. sinicus ACE2 to maintain genetic diversity and to fit 118 with the population of R. sinicus. show high polymorphism among the R. sinicus populations 122",

In this study, our analysis of the SARSr-CoV spike protein 358 and R. sinicus ACE2 gene sequences showed that some codons related to the 359 interaction interface between them were under positive selection. Similar rapid 360 adaptation for SARS-CoV occurred during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 (21, 34). 361 When SARS-CoV was transmitted from market civet to human, the spike gene 362 experienced positive selection, where mutations in two critical residues (amino acids 363 479 and 487) of the spike protein changed the binding affinity of the virus to human 364 ACE2 from low to high; subsequently, turning into a pandemic strain (34). 365 An increasing number of studies have suggested that co-evolution is driven by 366 specific interactions between high levels of virus sequence divergence and 367 polymorphic host receptors (20, 33, 35-38).

These examples are a warning that the 393 SARSr-CoVs circulating in R. sinicus may adapt to other animal hosts, including 394 humans, and cause the next SARS-like disease. Therefore, it is important to 395 continually monitor SARSr-CoVs in R. sinicus populations to avoid future spillover 396 events. Our study provides an example to assess the risk of a potential spillover from 397 viruses circulating in animal populations through the positive selection analysis, 398 structural modeling, and experimental verification.399 ACE2, a multifunctional enzyme involved in the negative regulation of the 400 renin-angiotensin system, also interacts with amino acid transporters and integrins (54, 401 23 55).

Moreover, the structural complex shows that the 403 SARS-CoV spike RBD does not block the catalytically-active site of ACE2 (21, 56). 404 Considering the conserved recognition site in receptor of SARSr-CoV clade 1, the 405 interface of SARS-CoV and ACE2 interaction would be an ideal target for drug 406 screening against a broad range of infections caused by these viruses. samples, cells, and viruses 414 Bat samples were from the biobank of our laboratory.

Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Waltham, MA, USA) and then quantified on the ABI Step One system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), with the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems life technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA dilutions from purifiedSARSr-CoV-RsWIV1 stock were used as a standard (with a titer of 6.5 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/mL). Every sample was analyzed in triplicate on two independent occasions.Binding assays between SARS/SARSr-CoV RBD and human or R. sinicus ACE2 protein were performed using the Octet RED system (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) in 96-well microplates at 30\u00b0C, as described previously (59, 60). Briefly, the RBD was biotinylated using EZ-Link NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The assay was carried out by placing the Streptavidin Biosensors (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) in the wells and measuring changes in layer thickness (nm) over time (s). First, the sensors were rinsed in the kinetic buffer497(1 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20; pH 6.5) for 120 s, which served as the baseline. Thereafter, the sensors were immobilized for 600 s, with 200 \u03bcL buffer containing biotinylated SARSr-CoV RBD (50 \u03bcg/mL). Subsequently, the sensors were washed in the kinetic buffer for 200 s. Finally, the sensors were exposed to a series of diluted ACE2 protein run in 200 \u03bcL volumes. The association between each RBD and its corresponding ACE2 binding partner was monitored for 900 s. This was followed by monitoring their dissociation in the kinetic buffer for 900 s. During the entire experiment, the sample plate was kept shaking at 1000 rpm, and an RBD-loaded biosensor was used in association with the buffer as a baseline. Data analysis from the ForteBio Octet RED instrument includes reference subtraction.Inter-step correction and Y-alignment were used to minimize tip-dependent variability.Data were globally fitted in a 1:1 model using the Data Analysis Software v7.1 (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA).Pseudotyped production and infection of ACE2-transfected HeLa cellsSARS-CoV-BJ01 pseudotyped particles were produced by HEK 293T/17 cells. Plasmids, pcDNA3.1-BJ01-S and pNL4-3.luc.R-E-, were co-transfected into HEK 293T/17 cells. At 6 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh 293T FreeStyle expression medium. The supernatant, which contained the pseudotyped particles, was harvested 48 h post-transfection and filtered using 0.45 \u03bcm filters. Thereafter, the pseudotyped particles were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. The viral titer was determined by the HIV p24 Quantitation ELISA Kits (Kyab Biotech Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China) before the viruses were used for the infection assay. HeLa cells were transfected with the same amount of human or R. sinicus ACE2 plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-BJ01 pseudotyped at an MOI = 1 or 0.1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, washed twice with D-Hanks solution, and supplemented with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Luciferase activity was determined using a GloMax luminometer (Promega Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) 48 h after infection. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate on two independent occasions.The structure complex of SARS-CoV/SARSr-CoVs RBD and R. sinicus ACE2 was homology modeled using SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), based on the structure of human SARS-CoV RBD (hTor2 RBD) complexed with human ACE2 (hACE2) and civet-optimized RBD complexed with hACE2 (Protein Data Bank ID: 2AJF, 3SCJ) (29). Molecular graphics visualization and analyses were performed using the UCSF Chimera software (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera).",
