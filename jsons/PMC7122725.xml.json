            "text": "The Texas Ebola patient has been identified as Thomas Eric Duncan (Onishi 2014). NPR reporter Wade Goodwyn provides an in-depth description of Duncan\u2019s illness and the events surrounding his diagnosis:\nWADE GOODWYN\n, BYLINE: The story begins on September 19, when a man in Liberia boarded a plane for Texas. He was tested for fever at the airport and showed none. That\u2019s important because this strain of Ebola is not contagious until symptoms of the illness begin to present in the patient. For three days after he arrived in Dallas on the 20[th], all was well. But last Wednesday, the man became sick. By Friday, he was so ill he went to the emergency room at Presbyterian Hospital. Dr. Edward Goodman\n, the top infectious disease specialist at Presbyterian, describes what happened next.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nEDWARD GOODMAN\n: I think he was evaluated for his illness, which was very nondescript. He had some laboratory tests, which were not very impressive. And he was dismissed on some antibiotic because he was like the majority of people who come in the emergency room.\n\nGOODWYN\n: If Dr. Goodman sounds the tiniest bit defensive, it\u2019s because of what happened next. Although the ER staff didn't realize it, Presby released an infected, contagious Ebola patient back into the general population. It will be this span of time, from when the Ebola symptoms first presented themselves up until when the man was admitted to the hospital, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will focus its tracking effort. As for the man who came from Liberia, as the weekend came to a close, he\u2019d grown so seriously ill with Ebola he returned to Presbyterian. Dr. Goodman\nsays this go-around, the ER staff figured out what they were looking at pretty quickly.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGOODMAN\n: I think those caring for him were suspicious of that almost immediately. The emergency room people identified that as a concern and consulted infection prevention department, which is my department, and consulted the infectious disease clinician. And that was on the top of everyone\u2019s list.\n\nGOODWYN\n: Ebola - it had quietly slipped into Dallas through the eighth-busiest airport in the world. Though the diagnosis would not be confirmed by the CDC for another two days, the patient was nevertheless whisked away into the hospital\u2019s isolation unit in intensive care. (Goodwyn 2014)\n",

The level of concern among other Dallas residents varies (Business Journals 2014; Hylton 2014). Some people are exceptionally worried. Others are unconcerned. A few think the dangers of the disease are overstated. Overall, most Dallas residents do not seem overly alarmed by the appearance of Ebola in their community (Business Journals 2014; Hylton 2014).",

Taken as a whole, these reports are convoluted and often contradictory. For example, the media usually refers to Ramos as a nurse, though she appears to have been a nursing assistant (e.g., Wheaton 2014). The following represents the best effort to provide an accurate description and timeline of Ramos\u2019s activities . Ramos entered Brother Viejo\u2019s room twice , once to change his undergarments and once to collect his personal belongings after his death (Alexander H 2014; Phillip and Ferdman 2014). She may have become infected when she touched her face with a gloved hand while removing her PPE (Independent.ie 2014). However, the use of substandard equipment and poor operating procedures may have contributed to her infection. Hospital staff told the investigators that the PPE they were issued did not meet WHO standards (Kassam 2014a; Phillip and Ferdman 2014). For example, gloves were simply sealed with adhesive tape. There were other problems with the care of Ebola patients at the hospital as well. For example, medical waste from Ebola patients was transported out of the hospital via the staff elevator (Kassam 2014a). Ramos left for vacation on the Spanish coast soon after Brother Viejo died (Morris 2014). On September 30, 2014, she developed a fever. She contacted occupational risk personnel at Carlos III Hospital about her condition. Because her fever was below 101.5 \u00b0F, she was advised to go to her local clinic (Kassam 2014b). During the early stages of her illness, Ramos used public transportation, visited restaurants and shops, and spent time with friends (Nadeau 2014). On October 2, 2014, she called Carlos III Hospital again to report that she still had a fever. She was directed [presumably meaning her call was routed] to a department of Madrid\u2019s regional health service (Botelho et al. 2014). It is unclear what she was told, but no significant action was advised (Kassam 2014b). She called the hospital again today to say she was severely ill (Kassam 2014b). She was advised to go to the nearest emergency facility, which was Alcorc\u00f3n . She was transported to the hospital by paramedics. At Alcorc\u00f3n, she told the staff she thought she had Ebola, but she was kept in the general emergency ward (Kassam 2014b).",

However, he also said that the rates of infection have been relatively stable for the past few weeks and this could indicate that the outbreak is slowing down (Achenbach 2014). A press statement released by the WHO today described an unexpected pattern seen in the outbreak. Infected areas often experience a slow decline in cases and then experience a sudden flare-up (World Health Organization 2014f).",

Vinson flew to Cleveland on October 10, 2014, and returned October 13 (Berman 2014; Shoichet et al. 2014). She developed a 99.5 \u00b0F fever before boarding the return plane (NBC DFW 2014). There were 132 other passengers on her return flight, Frontier Airlines flight 1143 (WKYC 2014). The CDC is asking passengers to contact the agency, so they can determine who might have been exposed to Vinson (Berman 2014; WKYC 2014). Vinson\u2019s apartment, located in the Village Apartments in Dallas, is being decontaminated (Associated Press 2014n; Zeeble 2014). Her stepfather\u2019s home in the Stonegate Reserve neighborhood in Tallmadge, Ohio, has been cordoned off by police (Harper 2014). Around midday today, health officials decided to move Vinson to Emory University Hospital for treatment. She arrived in Atlanta this evening (NBC News 2014e).",

She explained her situation, and said she had a 99.5 \u00b0F fever. The person she talked with checked the CDC website for guidance. It said that it was ok for a person with uncertain risk to fly if their temperature was below 100.4 \u00b0F (NBC DFW 2014). Dr. Frieden was not aware of these facts when he made his initial statements. In the future, however, the CDC vows that anyone who has had contact with infected patients will not be allowed to travel on commercial airlines (Shoichet et al. 2014). It is unclear how this travel ban will be enforced, but it has been suggested that people under Ebola surveillance might be placed on the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s no-fly list (Sheets 2014).",

Patients are often transferred among facilities, and Bai was quickly lost in the system. There was no record of Bai at any medical center. Eventually, Wilson located a nurse at the Island Clinic who knew about Bai. The nurse said Bai had died and been cremated. The communication problem is often exacerbated because healthcare workers do not want to give families bad news.

She had been treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with MSF. In a letter to the Dallas Morning News, Hickox described her arrival in the United States and her subsequent quarantine. She says she arrived at the airport about 1300 h on October 24, 2014. The trip from Sierra Leone had taken 2 days. When she told immigration she had come from Sierra Leone, she was taken to a quarantine office. She was there for 6 h. During this time, many people questioned her. At least one of the questioners was from the CDC. After 4 h, her temperature was taken with a forehead scanner. The reading was 101 \u00b0F. Hickox told the officer who took the temperature that she was very upset and the forehead reading was probably inaccurate. However, a more accurate oral temperature was not taken. Around 1900 h, she was told she would have to go to a hospital. Once there, her temperature was taken again, this time both orally and from the forehead. The oral reading was 98.6 \u00b0F, and the forehead reading was 101 \u00b0F. A blood test for Ebola came back negative (Hickox 2014).",

Today there are three. So it is just a dramatic, dramatic change. And part of it is that there has been, since they set up the unit here, a place to take people who are very sick. That has meant that they are not at home where they\u2019re at risk of infecting other people. But they say the biggest change is probably that they have sent health workers out into the community, people from the community who know the people here, and they have told them that the people at Medecins Sans Frontieres are not the people bringing Ebola but the people who are here to help them with that. And they\u2019ve taught them about hand washing about how not to have contact with bodies. And it has made just an enormous difference. (NPR 2014)\n",
