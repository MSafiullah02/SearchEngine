Taiwan is no exception, and VRE and MRSA infections have become emerging infectious diseases.6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

Although several studies have examined the relationship between antimicrobial consumption and antibiotic resistance, the findings were inconsistent, possibly due to differences in resistance profiles as well as due to differences in antibiotic-prescribing practices in different countries.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 In those studies, the use of glycopeptides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones was demonstrated to be associated with the prevalence of MRSA and VRE.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between the use of linezolid or fusidic acid and the prevalence of MRSA and VRE. In addition, the association between the consumption of tigecycline, a novel anti-Gram-positive agent derived from minocycline that has been shown to be effective against many Gram-negative rods as well as Gram-positive cocci, and the prevalence of MRSA and VRE has never been studied.19 Similarly, no studies have so far investigated the association between the prevalence of MRSA and VRE and the consumption of daptomycin, an anti-MRSA antibiotic that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections and bacteremia due to MRSA.20, 21 In this study, we investigated the correlation between consumption of antibiotics, including vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, tigecycline, fusidic acid, and daptomycin, and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA and HCAI-VRE during the period from 2000 to 2010 at a medical center in Taiwan.",

In addition, the consumption of tigecycline increased from 1.8 DDD/1000 inpatient-days in 2007 to 6.0 DDD/1000 inpatient-days in 2010.

In addition, we noted a negative correlation between the use of teicoplanin and linezolid and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA. Although further research is needed to clarify this association, our findings suggest that teicoplanin and linezolid might exert a protective effect against the emergence of MRSA. We also found that there was no significant correlation between the consumption of vancomycin, glycopeptides including vancomycin and teicoplanin, and fusidic acid and incidence of HCAI-MRSA, a finding that is consistent with that reported in our previous study.17 In addition, the consumption of tigecycline and daptomycin was not associated with the incidence of HCAI-MRSA. The reason for that finding is most likely due to the short duration of tigecycline and daptomycin use in our hospital.

Although we found a significant correlation between antibiotic use and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA, the etiology behind the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in our hospital is complicated and selective pressure from widespread use of antimicrobial agents might be only one of the causes. The prevalence of MRSA could have been affected by multiple factors such as infection-control measures and hand hygiene, or operational changes in the hospital. After the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the infection prevention and control program at the NTUH was upgraded to include hand hygiene, antibiotic-control policies, and an annual, intensive, project-based control program. In fact, it has been demonstrated that those policies are directly associated with the decrease in rates of HCAIs and bloodstream infections at the NTUH.25 However, those effects were not measured in this study. Whether those policies had an impact on MRSA trends remains unknown. In addition, because this was an epidemiological surveillance study, we did not analyze the impact that duration of exposure to antibiotics, or clonal spread of resistant bacteria had on the trend in incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection. Furthermore, the overall DDD of a given antibiotic is a notoriously problematic denominator as there will be changes in low-dose usage in specific groups of patients (i.e., children and patients with renal insufficiency). Therefore, an analysis using number of prescriptions for those patient groups would be more appropriate. However, the impact should be limited in this study because those specific patient groups comprised only a small fraction of the study patients and the effect would be diluted and equal in each year.",
