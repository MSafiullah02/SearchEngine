            "text": "Severe acute liver failure is defined as the development of overt liver failure with encephalopathy over eight\nweeks or less in previously healthy individuals. In hyperacute liver failure, deterioration occurs in less than\n14 days. Whilst it is a relatively uncommon reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), acute liver failure is\nimportant because it often occurs in previously well young adults and carries a high mortality. Management of these patients\npresents considerable challenges within the ICU due to the extreme nature of the associated pathophysiological processes,\nwhich affect multiple systems. Integrated management strategies have been poorly studied and treatment is often\ncenter-specific [1]. Clinical manifestations include a reduced conscious state,\njaundice with abnormal liver function tests (especially elevations in amino acid transferase levels more than 25 times the\nupper limit of normal) and coagulopathy. Further deterioration can involve marked cerebral edema, hypoglycemia and severe\nshock with lactic acidosis and multiple organ failure. The use of clinical management guidelines may assist in the treatment\nof these patients by providing an evidence-based framework for care by staff at the bedside, which ensures that all important\npriorities are adequately addressed. It is possible that a coordinated combination of specific and general therapies may\nreduce mortality and the need for liver transplantation. Consideration for transfer to a unit with expertise in liver\ntransplantation may be appropriate in order for this option to be available as a life-saving treatment should supportive\ncare fail to arrest deterioration.",

Causes of severe acute liver failure requiring ICU admission vary across\nregions, with drug-induced liver injury more common in industrialized nations and viral pathogens more common in developing\ncountries. Up to a fifth of cases have no clear cause and may be due to as yet unrecognized viral entities, unusual\npresentations of autoimmune processes or unrecognized drug complications. Patients in whom critical illness develops rapidly\n(e.g., hyperacute liver failure from paracetamol [acetaminophen] toxicity) may recover completely without the need for liver\ntransplantation if not overwhelmed by multiple organ failure, severe cerebral edema or complications, such as sepsis. For\npatients who exhibit a less fulminant course (e.g., as a result of idiosyncratic drug reactions), death is a frequent outcome\nunless transplantation is undertaken. Severe liver injury can sometimes also occur as a consequence of prolonged shock,\nwhere situations of advanced hemodynamic compromise result in ischemic hepatitis and considerable derangement of liver\nfunction. In this setting, ICU management is most appropriately directed to addressing the cause of the shocked state and\nits consequences, with specific liver failure directed therapies rarely required.",
