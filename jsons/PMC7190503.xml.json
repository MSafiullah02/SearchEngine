It was expected that the amount of submitted papers for peer review would raise sharply and the deadline of the review period at the COVID-19 outbreak will be tightened. Therefore, sample size calculation of these papers, a component that was being omitted in more than 40% of the published randomized controlled trials,1 might be neglected during the peer review process. Most importantly, authors of these papers were also rushing to conduct their COVID-19 research and they might not have seek necessary statistical consultation regarding sample size calculation. The CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement recommends trial reports to provide all essential information on the determination of sample size, including the level of statistical significance, the desired level of power, and the estimated effect size of the treatment. However, the degree of compliance to the CONSORT statement regarding sample size calculation of the newly-published COVID-19 trial papers is unknown. Therefore, we reviewed all clinical trials on COVID-19 patients published from 1st January 2020 to 4th April 2020 indexed in PubMed.",

Inappropriate sample size calculation will give a negative impression to its readers and leads to suspicion on the existence of other methodological flaws in the study. Some believed that studies with any sample size could still contribute to science 9 as the published results allow other readers to conduct a meta-analysis to obtain a more accurate estimate of treatment effect when further studies are available. However, in the time of rapid disease outbreak such as COVID-19, researchers are working around the clock to examine the effectiveness of potential treatments, and inappropriate sample size calculation will lead to adverse consequences. If the sample size is overestimated, researchers need to spend unnecessary, additional time to recruit study and clean the data, so that the release of the results would be delayed. On the other hand, if the sample size was underestimated, the probability of committing a type II error, that is, unable to reject the null hypothesis while the treatment is effective, will be high. A null find will discourage clinicians to use an effective treatment, and further studies are required to support its effectiveness, again resulting in a delay.",

Since the sample size should be determined a priori before the recruitment of the first patient, we strongly suggest all research teams include a statistician as a team member or invite a statistician to evaluate the appropriateness of the sample size calculation. It would be irreversible if flaws in sample size calculation are identified when the trial has been completed or the reported has been submitted for peer review.",
