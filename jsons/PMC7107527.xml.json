In addition, there are numerous bacterial zoonoses, fungal zoonoses and the emergence of variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Avian influenza H5N1 was detected in a domestic cat eating a bird carcass. The authors expressed concern regarding disease transmission to people from household cats.2",

To control the spread of SARS, public health officials held large numbers of their residents in quarantine for an average of 10 days (the incubation period of SARS).9 Quarantined persons were told to remain at home, not allow anyone to visit, wear a mask when in the same room as other members of the household and sleep in a separate room.",

The United Kingdom has been rabies-free since 1922, which was thought to be in part due to the strict laws requiring that imported cats and dogs be vaccinated and quarantined for 6 months immediately on entry into the country. However, at the end of 2002, dogs and cats from mainland America and Canada meeting the travel scheme requirements were able to forgo the 6-month quarantine. The Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) also has requirements for bringing other types of pet animals into the United Kingdom (for additional information about requirements for traveling with pets to the UK, visit www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm).",
