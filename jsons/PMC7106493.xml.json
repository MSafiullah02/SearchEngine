Based on the GRADE system the overall quality of evidence is determined by the lowest quality for critical outcomes, and thus the overall quality of evidence was very low for each of the clinical questions.",

The results of such work will help to establish whether these current recommendations will remain applicable. In view of the current uncertainty, clinicians will ask which other measures should be taken to treat H5N1 patients. Early antiviral treatment and supportive care remain key features in the management of H5N1 patients.34 Policymakers will ask whether the strong recommendation for treatment with oseltamivir leads to stockpiling. Because these recommendations were developed in the context of the current pandemic alert period without sustained human-to-human transmission, extrapolation to stockpiling decisions related to pandemic preparedness is limited, since different criteria for judgment are likely to apply including changing estimates of benefit and harm.",

Zanamivir is listed as a reasonable alternative in view of the limited availability of oseltamivir and since the evidence base for chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir is stronger than for treatment with this agent. Moreover, in certain situations of limited or no availability of neuraminidase inhibitors clinicians might consider the use of M2 inhibitors (recommendations 4, 6, 17, and 21), although no activity would be expected for resistant viruses.

In particular, weak recommendations will require careful evaluation of values and resources before they can be implemented.

Emergence of novel human influenza A viral subtypes or a change in the pathogenicity or transmissibility of H5N1 virus strains, availability of new pharmacological agents, or important clinical research data on H5N1 will necessitate an update of these guidelines.
