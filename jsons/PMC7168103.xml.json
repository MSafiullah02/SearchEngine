IBV has already caused major health concerns in the poultry industry around the world (Cavanagh, 2003). Like many other coronaviruses, IBV is an enveloped virus with a large, positive stranded RNA genome about 27\u201332 kilobases long (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The IBV virion is built from four structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein with which the genomic RNA is packed, the spike (S) protein that forms the prominent coronavirus spikes, the M protein which is the most abundant component of coronavirus, and the envelope (E) protein which is a minor but yet critical component in virion assembly (de Haan et al., 1998). In addition, N protein, combined with the viral RNA with high affinity (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006), is abundantly expressed in infected cells.",

Therefore, the use of vaccines alone is not sufficient to control IB (Gelb et al., 2005; Jackwood et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Bochkov et al., 2006). In China, the government prohibits the use of antiviral drugs in food animals, so more attention is being paid to traditional antiviral herbs, and many reports are confirming the potential use of Chinese traditional antiviral herbs in inhibiting the virus (Yamasaki et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2003; Mori et al., 1999; Li et al., 2009).",

Although forsythoside A did not inhibit IBV infection after virus absorption, and pretreatment of the cells with forsythoside A resulted in only partial inhibition of IBV infectivity, the sensitivity of cellular factors such as the surface receptors of IBV to the drug remains under investigation. Two approaches were used to analyse virus infection, and both real\u2010time PCR and CPE gave rise to similar results, which confirms the feasibility of these results.",
