The assumption that air pollution conditions facilitate the spread of the virus was shown and supported by Cui et al. [6] during the SARS outbreak in mainland China in November 2002. This study analyzed the correlation between the increment of the API (Air Pollution Index) and the rate of fatality due to SARS across 5 regions in China. The regions were selected according to their elevated Air Pollution Index, taking into consideration that an API less than 100 is thought to be healthy for the general population. According to this research, the five regions under investigation (Guangdong, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin) presented a linear relationship between API, in the period April to May 2003, and fatality rate due to SARS. The lower the API, the lower the mortality rate [6] .",

According to the recent SIMA analysis of Covid-19 diffusion in Italy, the atmospheric particulate matter exercises a carrier (or boost) action along with the virus. The PM 10 (particulate matter) is composed of solid and liquid particles which allow to float in the airflow longer and to be widespread over larger distances. Atmospheric PM has a sub-layer that facilitates the virus survival in airflows for hours or days. The local atmospheric aspect is another environmental factor that must be considered in the accelerated diffusion of this virus. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 has facilitated activation rates when in presence of high local relative humidity, while it is inhibited in hot climate situations [8] . This research shows how the Italian Northern Regions, which have been the most affected by Covid-19, are also those with a high amount of atmospheric particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) going above the legislative standards (limit, 50 \u03bcg/m 3 per day) in the month of February 2020. This relationship can also be seen by comparing the following two images which illustrate the nitrogen dioxide emissions and the Covid-19 case fatality in Northern Italy during January 2020. The red zone in Fig. 1 indicates high PM agglomerations while the red circles in Fig. 2 designate those infected. A correlation between elevated concentration of PM and the high spread and mortality rate is visible.",

The above studies show that air pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, are most likely direct to facilitate the longevity of virus particles in favorable climate conditions. SARS virus and other respiratory diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) find fertile \"territory\" in air pollutant particles and, in a linear relationship, they survive longer and become more aggressive in an immune system already aggravated by these harmful substances. This hypothesis needs to be validated by further future epidemiological studies in multiple geographic regions affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
