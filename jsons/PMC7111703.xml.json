            "text": "The roots and stolons of Glycyrrhiza plants (G. glabra L.) are among the most important sources of crude herbal drugs worldwide (Gibson, 1978). Triterpene saponins are high molecular weight glycosides that are composed of a sugar moiety linked to triterpene or a steroid aglycone. Precursors of saponins typically undergo various modifications prior to the addition of sugar molecules. The types and extent of the sugar molecules that comprise triterpene saponins differ greatly among saponin-containing plants (Hayashi et al., 1990, Hayashi et al., 1992, Vincken et al., 2007). The root of liquorice contains a large amount (up to 15%) of glycyrrhizin and oleanane-type triterpene saponins, which are known to have various food, industrial, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications (Armanini et al., 2005). Saponins are commercially used in food and industrial settings as foaming, detergent, wetting, emulsifying and sweetening agents (Hostettmann and Marston, 2005, Shibata, 2000). They are also utilised as ingredients in the cosmetics, cleansing and personal care sectors, such as shower gels, shampoos, hair conditioners, lotions, liquid soaps, baby care products, mouthwashes, and toothpastes. The pharmacological properties of glycyrrhizin and structural elucidation of triterpenes and saponins have been widely studied, revealing that these compounds have important pharmaceutical activities aside from their involvement in plant defence responses (Agrell et al., 2003, Mahato et al., 1992, Mahato et al., 1988, Osbourn, 1996). These important properties include anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, molluscicidal, antiulcer, insecticidal, and anti-allergic activities, as well as involvement in immune system activation (De Leo et al., 2006, Gopalsamy et al., 1990, He et al., 2001, Kuzina et al., 2009, Matsui et al., 2004, Park et al., 2004, Takahara et al., 1994). Glycyrrhizin also displays antivirus activity against several viruses, such as HIV (Ito et al., 1987, Ito et al., 1988) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by Coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003).",

            "text": "A number of sequential enzymatic reactions are required for the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins in plants. Squalene is the immediate biological precursor of all triterpenoids. Squalene synthase (SQS) catalyses the formation of squalene from farnesyl diphosphate (Hayashi, 2009). In the triterpene biosynthesis pathway, a common intermediate of triterpenoids, saponins and phytosterols is 2,3-oxidosqualene, which is cyclised via oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) (Abe et al., 1993, Haralampidis et al., 2002, Xu et al., 2004). In G. glabra, there are three OSCs: \u03b2-amyrin synthase (bAS), lupeol synthase (LUS) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS). These three enzymes are involved in the cyclisation of 2,3-oxidosqualene to generate oleanane-type triterpene saponins (glycyrrhizin and soyasaponins), lupane-type triterpene (betulinic acid) and phytosterols, respectively (Mangas et al., 2006). In previous studies, cDNA from the genes encoding the oxidosqualene cyclases was cloned and characterised in G. glabra (Hayashi et al., 2000, Hayashi et al., 1999, Hayashi et al., 2001, Hayashi et al., 2004). The availability of the sequences of these genes essentially facilitates the identification of the conditions under which their expression levels are enhanced.",

            "text": "One critical abiotic stress that affects plant physiology and development is water deficiency caused by drought (Gueta-Dahan et al., 1997). The production of plant secondary metabolites is strongly associated with the growth conditions, and stress conditions in particular exert a strong impact on the corresponding metabolic pathways. Plants that are exposed to drought stress generally produce higher levels of secondary metabolites, including triterpenoids (Selmar and Kleinw\u00e4chter, 2013). Successful and efficient use of deliberate drought stress can directly enhance secondary metabolite production. This enhancement can be achieved by applying special irrigation regimes that are both simple and inexpensive, but this approach requires extensive examination to optimise metabolite production (Selmar and Kleinw\u00e4chter, 2013). Drought stress generally results in oxidative stress (Lei et al., 2006), which causes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts and mitochondria (Liu et al., 2011). ROS, such as superoxide (O2\n\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO\u2212), and singlet oxygen (1O2), disturb natural metabolism by inducing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and photosynthesis pigments and enzymes (Ozkur et al., 2009, Smirnoff, 1993). To prevent oxidative stress, plants employ enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defence mechanisms to scavenge ROS (Smirnoff, 1993). There is evidence from various plant systems indicating that environmental stress, particularly drought and salt stresses, alters the quantities, activities and steady-state mRNA levels of enzymes involved in oxygen radical scavenging (Gueta-Dahan et al., 1997). It has been found that triterpenoids display antioxidant activity (Okubo and Yoshiki, 2000). It has been demonstrated that glycyrrhizin and its hydrolysed metabolite 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid from G. glabra play an important role in ROS scavenging, resulting in a significant reduction in oxidative damage (Kim and Lee, 2008).",

Thus, the identification of key genes involved in glycyrrhizin production, as well as the conditions under which gene expression reaches to a maximal level, is of interest to the biomedical industry. To determine the optimal conditions under which glycyrrhizin production is maximally increased, we applied various drought stresses and assessed the expression levels of key genes, including SQS, bAS, LUS and CAS, that are involved in triterpenoid saponin production.

            "text": "The enzymes SQS, bAS CAS and LUS are known to be involved in triterpenoid synthesis (Hayashi, 2009). SQS converts squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene, which serves as the substrate for the synthesis of glycyrrhizin and other triterpenoids. CAS, bAS, and LUS encode OSCs, which catalyse the cyclisation of 2,3-oxidosqualene, a precursor of glycyrrhizin, betulinic acid and sitosterol (Abe et al., 1993, Haralampidis et al., 2002). Glycyrrhizin, soyasaponins and betulinic acid are located in different regions of intact liquorice plants, and the biosynthetic regulation of these constituents is also specific. It was previously demonstrated that the expression level of OSCs was the most influential regulator of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis (Hayashi, 2009). In addition, gene expression analysis revealed that the transcriptional expression level of bAS was higher in cell culture and thickened main roots and root nodules of liquorice plants (Hayashi, 2009). Choi et al. (2005) demonstrated that the gene expression of SQS was up-regulated in hairy root cultures of Panax ginseng by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJa). In another study, up-regulation of the SQS and bAS genes via MeJa and salicylic acid (SA) was reported (Chen et al., 2007, Suzuki et al., 2005). In contrast, application of gibberellin A3 resulted in down-regulation of bAS, but the gene expression levels of LUS and CAS were unchanged. Likewise, the gene expression levels of SQS and bAS were down-regulated in G. glabra cells after addition of yeast extract to the cell culture. The mRNA level of LUS was down-regulated in G. glabra cells treated with jasmonate acid (JA) or MeJA, whereas under the same conditions, the mRNA level of the CAS gene was not altered (Hayashi et al., 2004). In addition, the CAS mRNA levels in the thickened main roots of G. glabra remained relatively constant throughout the seasons, indicating that the CAS gene displays housekeeping gene-like expression in G. glabra (Hayashi et al., 2004). In agreement with these findings, our results also revealed that the gene expression of CAS remained constant in plants grown under drought stress or control conditions. Hayashi et al. (2004) reported that the level of LUS mRNA was not detectable under various cultivation conditions, which is similar to our finding that the expression of the LUS gene was not detectable (data not shown). Chen et al. (2007) found that the transcriptional expression level of bAS in the roots of Bupleurum kaoi was doubled due to treatment with MeJA. Additionally, it was reported that the transcriptional expression level of bAS was significantly increased in liquorice and Medicago truncatula plants due to treatment with salicylic acid (Suzuki et al., 2005).",

Studies using various plant systems demonstrated that environmental stress, including drought or salt stress, enhances the transcriptional expression levels and the activities of enzymes involved in oxygen radical scavenging (Gueta-Dahan et al., 1997). Drought stress generally stimulates oxidative stress (Lei et al., 2006) resulting in the formation of ROS in organelles, including chloroplasts and mitochondria (Fu and Huang, 2001). Subsequently, as a feed-back regulation mechanism, triterpenoids are produced as an antioxidant to scavenge ROS (Okubo and Yoshiki, 2000). There are many pieces of evidence indicating that glycyrrhizin and its hydrolysed metabolite 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid exert antioxidant effects (Kim and Lee, 2008). In Bupleurum spp., an incremental effect of drought stress on the levels of triterpenoids was also reported (Zhu et al., 2009). Triterpenes and \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin metabolites extracted from Jatropha gaumeri leaves displayed antioxidant activity (Can-Ak\u00e9 et al., 2004). In Hypericum brasiliense, the content of various betulinic acids was greatly higher in plants grown under drought stress than control conditions (Nacif de Abreu and Mazzafera, 2005). Nacif de Abreu and Mazzafera (2005) also reported that the total level of secondary metabolites in H.\nbrasiliense was increased under drought stress compared to normal conditions.",

The recent over-utilisation of wild Glycyrrhiza plants has resulted in a reduction in its natural reserves. Cultivated Glycyrrhiza is grown in some countries, but the glycyrrhizin content extracted from these plants is often low (Hayashi and Sudo, 2009). Thus, identifying the conditions under which glycyrrhizin production is maximised is of interest. In this study, we found that drought stress increased the expression of important genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway. This result indicates that intense drought stress, as well as periodic drought stress, may help to increase the glycyrrhizin content in liquorice plants. Therefore, we propose applying special irrigation regimes to directly enhance secondary metabolite production. This is technique a simple and inexpensive, but further investigation is required to optimise metabolite production.",
