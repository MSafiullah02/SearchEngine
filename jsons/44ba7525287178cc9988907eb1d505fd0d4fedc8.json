The 50% effective inhibitory concentration (EC 50 ) of LPV for the plaque reduction assay is 6 \u00b5g/mL in the Vero cell line.

This in vivo evidence is suggestive of the potential for LPV/r to treat MERS-CoV infections. When LPV/r was combined with IFN-\u03b2, the antiviral activity (EC 50 = 160 IU/mL) was indistinguishable from that of IFN-\u03b2 alone (EC 50 = 175 IU/mL, P = .62).

Moreover, a combination regimen of interferon + ribavirin + LPV/r was recommended officially for MERS therapy in Korea, where MERS began to spread in 2015. 23 Without randomized controlled trials, determining treatment is difficult due to patient and treatment variability as well as a lack of appropriately matched controls.

Currently, the combination of LPV/r is a recommended antiviral regimen in the latest version of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.4 | DISCUSSION Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for any human CoV infection. Upon the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, patients were administered off-label antivirals. Most in vitro studies have shown that SARS-CoV could be inhibited by LPV and that the EC 50 of LPV is acceptable. Furthermore, two retrospective matched cohort studies of SARS patients revealed that LPV/r plays an essential role in the clinical outcome, especially in the early stage. LPV/rtreatment alone or in combination with interferon had improved clinical outcomes in experiments involving common marmosets and in some MERS patient. However, we need to wait for more clinically valid evidence to confirm the positive value of LPV for COVID-19 treatment. Although most of the data indicate the efficacy of LPV, adverse reactions should be kept in mind. Diarrhea, nausea, and asthenia are the most frequently reported reactions in patients receiving LPV therapy. 5 Elevated total bilirubin, triglyceride, and hepatic enzyme levels have also been reported. 20,21 A retrospective study of MERS showed that the most common symptoms and laboratory tests of LPV/r PEP were diarrhea (40.9%), nausea (40.9%), stomatitis (18.2%), fever (13.6%), anemia (45.0%), leukopenia (40.0%), and hyperbilirubinemia (100%). 22 However, the symptoms and laboratory tests returned to normal after LPV therapy ceased. The protease inhibitor LPV could be an effective treatment based on the experience accumulated from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The treatment of CoV patients with LPV/r improved their outcomes. LPV/r may be a potential treatment option for COVID-19.",
