Doing so would maximize the benefits for patients that are receiving care through the implementation of ERAS protocols [2] . Enhancing the management of persistent perioperative pain would translate into decreased time in the postanesthesia recovery unit (PACU), reduced opioid consumption, earlier hospital discharge, and improvement in patient satisfaction.",

Dexmedetomidine, therefore, is a crucial component of the multimodal analgesia approach. A large collection of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine to be superior to other agents in the perioperative setting [5-8, 9\u2022\u2022, 10, 11\u2022\u2022, 12-16] . For example, dexmedetomidine has superior pain control in several types of laparoscopic procedures, such as bariatric and gynecological procedures, and opensurgery approaches, such as colorectal, major spine, and abdominal hysterectomy surgeries. Patients report higher satisfaction scores after dexmedetomidine, which is likely related to decreased pain and decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). For these reasons, many providers opt for using dexmedetomidine as part of multimodal therapy.",

This negative feedback back loop leads to attenuation of sympathetic response and decreases both heart rate and blood pressure [16] .

Its sympatholytic effects are generally beneficial for patients undergoing cardiac procedures [16] . The recommended adult dose may also be given in children, given as a loading dose of 0.25 to 6 \u03bcg/kg/h over 10 min and a maintenance does of 0.2 to 1.4 \u03bcg/kg/h to achieve a cook scale between 7 and 14 points [14] . Dexmedetomidine clearance is about 50% in newborns that eventually matures to adult levels by the end of new neonatal age. Neonates have larger volume of distribution with increased elimination half-life due to liver immaturity and lower albumin levels [14] . Also, a higher concentration of dexmedetomidine is found in neonatal brains due to immature blood-brain barrier. At lower doses, no cardiopulmonary side effects occur but hypothermia and bradycardia have been reported with use of dexmedetomidine in neonates [14] . In older children, dexmedetomidine is well tolerated and efficacy similar to that seen in adults. Analgesia with non-opioids analgesics like dexmedetomidine are being used as part of an ERAS protocol intraoperatively, along with regional nerve blocks to attain a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced requirements of opioids in PACU in the pediatric population. With more requests for procedural sedation for diagnostics procedures like MRI, ambulatory center procedures, dexmedetomidine has become an attractive option for non-IV route of sedation especially buccal administration at least 45 min before the elected time in a dose 2 to 3 \u03bcg/kg. This provides adequate sedation in approximately 80% of patients with a failure rate of 20% requiring other modes of sedation [25] .",

One randomized controlled trial comparing dexmedetomidine PCA with fentanyl PCA for postoperative pain control found that although there was no significant difference in VAS pain score at 6 h postoperatively, the patients with the dexmedetomidine PCA had higher patient satisfaction with pain control, faster return of bsowel function, and a lower incidence of PONV [8] .

Panchgar et al. had similar results in laparoscopic surgeries with a loading dose of 1 \u03bcg/kg body weight and then a maintenance dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/h for the remainder of the procedure. Time to rescue analgesia postoperatively was 50 min in the control group vs. 360 min in the dexmedetomidine group. The total 24-h analgesic need was also significantly less for the dexmedetomidine group (90 mg) vs. the NS control group (195 mg) [70] . A recent meta-analysis involving 18 studies and 1284 patients showed that dexmedetomidine used in conjunction with opioids in patient-controlled analgesia resulted in lower overall opioid utilization with no increase in adverse reactions [48] . Dexmedetomidine has been paired with propofol to achieve opioid-free total intravenous anesthesia in gynecologic laparoscopy. It demonstrated improved pain scores, delayed rescue analgesia, and decreased total rescue analgesic dose [59] .",

            "text": "The main adverse event healthcare workers should be cautious of when administering dexmedetomidine is hemodynamic instability, namely bradycardia, hypotension, and hypertension. Song et al. found that patients who received dexmedetomidine intraoperatively had almost a 2-fold increase in bradycardia compared with the control group [57] . Meanwhile, Shariffudin et al. found a significant decrease in the systolic blood pressure at the 15-min mark after infusion. This phenomena disappeared by the 20-min mark and did not return for the remainder of the case [69] . It appears that these episodes of hemodynamic disturbance are associated with the use of a loading dose or fast initial infusion rates. One way to mitigate this is to forgo a loading bolus and instead utilize a slower basal infusion rate. Although these hemodynamic changes do not cause issue for the majority of patients, healthcare providers should use caution when administering dexmedetomidine to patients who are less able to tolerate bradycardia. These might include patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities, those taking medications that alter cardiac conduction, and the elderly [80] . Additionally, care should be taken to adjust the dosing in patients with hepatic impairment, as dexmedetomidine is predominantly metabolized in the liver [14] . Although dexmedetomidine has proven to be a relatively safe drug, the lack of a reversal agent is an issue. Atipamezole is a synthetic a2-antagonist that has been shown to reverse the actions of dexmedetomidine; however, it is currently only approved for use in dogs. More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of atipamezole in humans. G a i n i n g a p p r o v a l f o r h u m a n u s e w o u l d m a k e dexmedetomidine an even more attractive option [14] . There is currently a paucity of data addressing the potential neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and renoprotective effects of dexmedetomidine. The trials that have been conducted are mostly animal models, but have been encouraging enough to merit future research in humans [79] .",
