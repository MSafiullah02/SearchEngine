Peritoneal oxygenation uses the large surface area of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, as a gas exchanger. The main advantages of peritoneal oxygenation are easy access for catheterization; relative safety of circulating oxygen through the peritoneal cavity, in which the mesothelium acts as a gas-permeable barrier between the perfusate and the blood; and avoidance of extracting and reintroducing blood.

The mixture was heated to 65 \u00b0C and dispersed using a Branson 450 sonifier (Danbury, CT) with an output power of 5/10 until the solution was translucent. The resulting solution was stored in a refrigerator prior to microbubble synthesis. Oxygen microfoam was prepared by adapting the process design developed by Swanson et al. [22] for synthesizing large volumes of oxygen microbubbles. The process consisted of an ultrasonic horn reactor enclosed in a water-cooled, continuous-flow chamber (Branson, Danbury, CT). The lipid suspension was fed at 5 \u00b0C and combined with room temperature oxygen gas in the reactor at roughly equal volumetric flow rates. The oxygen gas was emulsified at full sonication power and then fed to a flotation column to separate the oxygen microbubbles (bottom) from the macrofoam (top). Oxygen microbubbles were immediately collected from the bottom of the column using 60-mL syringes and centrifuged (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at 110 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 4 min to form a \u223c70 vol% concentrate. The concentrated oxygen microfoam was then transferred to 500-mL Wheaton serum bottles (Pasadena, TX), sealed under an oxygen atmosphere, and stored in the refrigerator. The infranatant lipid suspension from the centrifugal wash was collected and recycled into the sonication process to produce more microfoam. The process was repeated until the desired volume of 70 vol% oxygen microfoam was produced. Oxygen microbubble size distribution was determined using the electrozone sensing method (Coulter Multisizer III, Beckman Coulter, Opa Locka, FL). Oxygen gas volume fraction was determined by subtracting the weight of a fixed volume of microfoam from the weight of the same volume of aqueous medium (10 mg/mL lipid in PBS), and dividing this difference by the weight of the same volume of aqueous medium. Gas headspace purity in the serum bottle was determined using a model 6600 precision headspace gas analyzer (Illinois Instruments Inc, Johnsburg, IL).",

The research subjects were male Wistar rats (n = 10, mass = 430 \u00b1 15 g, Charles River), housed 2 per cage and acclimated for 4 days with free access to food and water. We performed a controlled laboratory study to test the therapeutic benefit of an intraperitoneal infusion of oxygen microbubbles in rats experiencing acute lung injury. Right pneumothorax was chosen as an appropriate model for acute lung injury based on prior work reported in the literature [20]. Two treatments were applied: oxygen microbubbles or oxygenated saline control. Following induction of pneumothorax, we observed vital signs and measured intraperitoneal pressure, infused volume, rectal temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation (SaO2). The animals were randomly assigned to cages by the caretakers, and the animals were randomly chosen for treatments. No additional blinding was done in the study. The number of animals used in this study was determined from work by Matsutani et al. [20] and a preliminary feasibility study. In Matsutani, a synthetic oxygen carrier was injected into the intraperitoneal (IP) space of rats for the purpose of systemic oxygenation. The mean standard deviation and mean effective size were 6.9 and 19.9, respectively [20]. We assumed the same standard deviation, but half the effective size (\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\n0 = 10). Using these values, a target Type I error of 0.05 and a sample size of 6 rats per group yielded a power of 0.81. In our preliminary feasibility study, a sample size of 4 rats was used in the oxygen microfoam group, and 3 rats were used in the control group. Using the Log-rank test for comparison of the survival distribution (\u03b1 = 0.05), a significant difference was found between the two groups (\u03a7\n2 = 6.624, P = 0.010). Based on these results, it was decided that a sample size of 5 rats per group would be adequate for the lung injury study. Data collection was stopped due to either cardiac arrest or achievement of the primary endpoint. Additional criteria were established to allow for the exclusion of samples where complications arose. Criteria for exclusion included the occurrence of unsuccessful pneumothorax or infrequent data points being collected by the veterinary monitor. One rat from the control group was excluded from the study because both exclusion criteria occurred in the trial. No other data were excluded. No test for outliers was used; all data were included in the study. A primary endpoint of 2 h following induction of pneumothorax was selected to avoid complications arising from animal recovery from anesthesia and the initial lung injury. We sometimes observed these complications in animals living more than 2 h in our preliminary feasibility study. We calculated that the 2-h endpoint would be sufficiently long to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in mean survival time between animal receiving our therapy and the control group. Prior to our study, the longest mean survival time for an intraperitoneal oxygenation therapy following pneumothorax reported in the literature was \u223c33 min [20]; thus, a mean survival time exceeding 2 h was deemed a significant improvement over the current state of the art and of high clinical utility. No other endpoints were specified. No replicates were performed. Each animal received only one pneumothorax and one treatment.",

Male Wistar rats (n = 10, mass = 430 \u00b1 15 g, Charles River) were anesthetized in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane to effect and maintained on 2% isoflurane. Each rat was weighed, given an IP injection of sodium pentobarbital solution (50 mg/kg dose), and then placed in the supine position on a warming pad (T/pump Classic, Gaymar) set at 38 \u00b0C to maintain body temperature. After the rat was fully sedated and unresponsive to pain delivered by paw pinches, a small incision into the skin was made to expose the fascia of the abdominal wall. A 12-gauge indwelling catheter was then inserted into the IP cavity and fitted to tubing (3.2 mm inner diameter, Tygon) by a Luer lock for subsequent infusions. A 22-gauge indwelling catheter was also inserted into the IP cavity and connected to two pressure transducers (4426-005G, Measurement Specialties Inc.) for measuring intra-abdominal pressure via a data acquisition system (myDAQ, LabVIEW, National Instruments). A veterinary monitor (SurgiVet Advisor, Smith's Medical) was used to monitor vitals. A pulse oximetry sensor (V3078, Smith's Medical) was clipped to the hind leg of the rat to measure the pulse rate and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO2). A temperature probe (WWV3418, Smith's Medical) was placed rectally for monitoring body temperature. A bolus of perfusate was pumped through a fluid warmer (iWarm, Midmark) set at 40.4 \u00b0C and into the IP space with a peristaltic pump (Thermo Scientific, FH100M) at 40 mL/min for 1 min, and then at 8 mL/min thereafter. At this time, the rats experienced a right pneumothorax by perforating the pleura of the pulmonary cavity with a scalpel. Infusion lasted until distension of the abdomen was noticeable, and the total infused volume of perfusate was recorded. The fluids used as a perfusate were saline as the control and oxygen microfoam (70 vol% O2 gas volume fraction).",

Our design was chosen to mimic the naturally occurring surfactant that lines the lung alveolus [23], which is primarily composed of diacyl phosphatidyl-choline (PC). Saturated PC lipids self-assemble at the gas/water interface to form a 3-nm thick monomolecular layer that can be compressed to achieve very low interfacial tensions [24], which is necessary to avoid premature microbubble dissolution [25]. We chose distearoyl PC (DSPC) as the main lipid component because it provides an optimal tradeoff between in-plane rigidity to stabilize microbubbles for long durations in storage [26] and relatively low gas permeation resistance [27]. The lipid monolayer is permeable to oxygen and other gases, so the bubble is in continuous diffusive exchange with surrounding dissolved gases [28]. While highly permeable, the lipid shell modulates gas exchange by resisting monolayer expansion and compression beyond the close-packed lipid configuration at the microbubble resting radius [29]. We also chose a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugated lipopolymer with a matching stearate lipid anchor as an emulsifying agent to improve yield by promoting lipid adsorption onto newly formed oxygen microbubbles and inhibiting microbubble coalescence. Self-consistent field theory calculations indicate that under these conditions the PEG chains form a \u223c10-nm thick hydrated brush layer [30], which can lead to very high repulsive pressures between closely approaching microbubbles [31]. The PC/PEG shell comprises only \u223c1% of the total microbubble volume, but is essential for stabilizing the microbubbles against coalescence and dissolution.",

In this study, male Wistar rats (n = 10, mass = 430 \u00b1 15 g) were anesthetized and placed in the supine position on a warming pad (Fig 2a).

            "text": "However, if available oxygen carrying capacity was the only criterion for successful peritoneal oxygenation, then ventilation with pure oxygen (1.26 mg-O2 mL\u22121) should not have failed to provide clinically relevant oxygenation, as reported by Giffin et al. [14]. We attribute the limited uptake for pure oxygen ventilation to the problem with injecting a bolus of free gas into the peritoneal cavity. Surface area is minimized owing to the high surface free energy (\u223c73 mJ/m2) of the gas/water interface. Thus, one may compare the transport of a centimeter-scale bubble for pure oxygen ventilation to hundreds of billions of micrometer-scale bubbles for OMBs. The transport process from the bubble to the bulk fluid occurs via three steps (Fig. 4a): (i) diffusion from the bulk gas to the inner surface of the lipid monolayer shell, (ii) diffusion through the lipid monolayer shell and absorption into the liquid phase and (iii) diffusion in the liquid from the bubble surface to the bulk. The mass transport resistance for diffusion from the gas to the surface (R\ngas) is estimated from kinetic theory to be approximately 10\u22125 s/cm [37] and is independent of microbubble size assuming zero tension in the lipid shell [24]. The shell resistance to oxygen permeation (R\nshell) has been measured to be approximately 102 s/cm [27], which is larger than 1.2 s/cm predicted by a statistical thermodynamics calculation for absorption at a clean oxygen gas/liquid interface [38]. The mass transfer resistance for diffusion in the liquid (R\nbulk) for a purely diffusing sphere is given as [39]:(1)Rbulk=R/Dwhere R is the bubble radius and D is the diffusivity of oxygen in water. A plot of the three transport resistances shows that diffusion in the liquid dominates the transport process for larger bubbles, but begins to approach that of the shell for microbubbles (Fig. 4b). Thus, the oxygen flux from microbubbles to the peritoneum approaches the physical upper limit for gas absorption through a lipid monolayer. In addition to increasing the oxygen transfer coefficient (k\nL), OMBs provide an increase in interfacial area per unit volume (a = 2.10 \u00d7 104 cm2 mL\u22121 for 70 vol% of 8-\u03bcm diameter OMBs) compared to a 1-cm diameter ventilation bubble (a = 4.20 cm2 mL\u22121). This gives an estimated volumetric transport coefficient (k\nL\na) of 45 s\u22121 for OMBs compared to 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121 for a ventilation bubble. The total oxygen transport rate is equal to the product of the volumetric transport coefficient and the concentration gradient between the gas phase and the peritoneum. Thus, OMBs provide a much higher overall oxygen delivery rate to the peritoneum, providing a plausible explanation as to why OMBs are successful in peritoneal oxygenation where pure oxygen ventilation has failed.",

More research must be done to investigate microbubble peritoneal oxygenation in larger animals where the ratio of the peritoneal area to total body mass is closer to humans. To mitigate this limitation, other serous membranes could be perfused to increase the surface area for O2 transfer. For example, it may be possible to circulate OMBs through the intrapleural space. This limitation underscores the necessity of efficient O2 transfer between the perfusate and the serous membrane, and as shown in this work, OMBs provide high O2 carrying capacity and rapid diffusion capability.",
