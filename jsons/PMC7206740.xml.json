            "text": "Despite decades of intensive research, sepsis remains a common deadly, costly, and debilitating intensive care unit (ICU) syndrome [1\u20133]. Traditionally, sepsis has been viewed to be due to an over-exuberant systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that caused early deaths from refractory septic shock or unremitting multiple organ failure (MOF) [4\u20136]. Once triggered, this systemic process was believed to progress independent of the inciting infection and thus patients with different types of infection have been grouped together in clinical trials [7]. Unfortunately, innumerable trials of promising immune-modulating interventions have failed to reduce early mortality and the recent consensus is that heterogeneity played a major role in these dismal failures [8\u201310]. It has been shown that site of infection is an independent predictor of early mortality [11\u201315]. However, the epidemiology of sepsis has evolved. With rapid implementation of evidence-based care, early mortality has decreased substantially, but many sepsis survivors are now progressing into chronic critical illness (CCI) with poorly defined long-term outcomes [16\u201322]. Moreover, the differential impact of site of infection on the immune response, progression of organ dysfunctions, and ICU utilization has not been characterized. We, therefore, sought to determine if there were significant differences in the host response and current epidemiology of surgical sepsis categorized by site of infection. We hypothesized that patients classified by site of infection will experience different clinical phenotypes when compared by baseline predisposition, initial septic insult characteristics, serial immune biomarker response, and organ dysfunction resolution, as well as their ICU and long-term clinical outcomes. Understanding this heterogeneity will assist clinicians in prognostication and decision-making. Additionally, insights into the underlying pathobiology of this phenotypic heterogeneity will be needed to develop more precise interventions and design future clinical trials.",

            "text": "In this study, we define surgical sepsis as being sepsis treated in the surgical and trauma ICUs. Compared to medical ICU sepsis, surgical ICU sepsis patients are less likely to have severe comorbidities because of surgeon selection bias and trauma ICU patients tend to be younger with a less severe comorbid disease. Surgical ICU sepsis patients are also different because they are exposed to sequential insults that promote persistent dysregulated immunity. Our interest in this population originates from two reports in which we demonstrated that ICU mortality after surgical sepsis decreased substantially as a result of early sepsis screening and reliable implementation of evidence-based ICU care [16, 23]. We noted, however, that a substantial portion of the patients were being discharged to non-home destinations with significant disabilities. In a 2012 review article, we described the emergence of this new predominant clinical trajectory of CCI with lingering low-grade organ dysfunction and we coined the term Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome (PICS) to provide a mechanistic hypothesis in which to study CCI in septic surgical ICU patients [24]. In 2014, the University of Florida (UF) Sepsis Critical Illness Research Center (SCIRC) was awarded a National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) P50 team science grant to test this hypothesis. The clinical component of this translational research program was a 5-year prospective longitudinal cohort study which collected the data included in this manuscript. Other reports from this team science effort indicate that PICS-CCI in surgical ICU sepsis and trauma patients is a valid concept [25\u201327].",

            "text": "This is an analysis of a prospective, longitudinal cohort study that enrolled patients over 4 years ending December 2018 who were then followed for 1 year. The purpose of the study was to define the epidemiology, dysregulated immunity, and outcomes of surgical patients that were admitted with, or subsequently developed sepsis. It was carried out in two 24 bed surgical ICUs at the University of Florida (UF), Shands Hospital (Gainesville, FL; USA), and conducted by the UF SCIRC. A detailed description of the study design with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the clinical and laboratory standard operating procedure (SOPs) utilized has been published [28]. In brief, overall cohort inclusion criteria included: (1) age \u2265 18 years, (2) clinical diagnosis of sepsis as defined by 2001 international consensus guidelines, and (3) entrance into an electronic medical record sepsis screening and evidence-based ICU management protocol [16, 23]. Exclusion criteria eliminated patients whose baseline immunosuppression, end-stage comorbidities, or severe functional disabilities would be a primary determinant of their long-term outcomes and thus confound outcome assessment. Sepsis screening was performed using the Modified Early Warning Signs-Sepsis Recognition Score (MEWS-SRS), which quantifies derangement in temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, mental status, and white blood cell count [16]. Patients with significant derangements identified in these variables to exceed screening score of 5 were assessed by a physician or advanced practice provider to confirm the likelihood of sepsis.",

Patients were classified by three inpatient clinical trajectories: (1) early death, (2) rapid recovery, and (3) chronic critical illness (CCI). Early death was defined as death within 14 days of sepsis onset. CCI was defined as an ICU stay greater than or equal to 14 days with evidence of persistent organ dysfunction based upon components of the SOFA score. Rapid recovery patients are those discharged from the ICU within 14 days with resolution of organ dysfunction, or those not meeting criteria for early death or CCI. Discharge disposition was classified based on known associations with long-term outcomes as either \u201cgood\u201d (home with or without health care services, or rehabilitation facility) or \u201cpoor\u201d (long-term acute care centers, skilled nursing facilities, another acute care hospital, hospice or inpatient death).

Abdominal sepsis included primary infections arising within the abdomen (from the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, or hepatobiliary tree) or secondary infections from procedural complications (such as anastomotic leaks, iatrogenic perforations, and abscesses). Pulmonary infections include pneumonia and empyema. S/ST infections included primary soft tissue infections and surgical site infections. The diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) was confirmed by examining the operative reports for evidence of necrotic tissue requiring debridement and/or amputation. GU infections included infections arising from the urinary tract or the male or female genital tracts. Vascular infections included mycotic aneurysms, septic thrombophlebitis, infected prosthetic grafts, or a central line-associated bloodstream infections. The latter was considered as any bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line/catheter at the time of, or within 48 h prior to, the onset of infection which does not appear to be related to infection from another site.",

The five subgroups (in decreasing frequency) were abdominal (44%), pulmonary (19%), S/ST (18%), GU (12%), and vascular (7%). There were subgroup differences in baseline predisposition. Abdominal sepsis patients had the highest rates of comorbid active cancer, defined as solid or hematologic malignancy diagnosed or treated within 6 months (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) or recurrent/metastatic disease. Pulmonary infections (principally pneumonia) most frequently occurred in males admitted for trauma or elective surgery. S/ST infection patients (predominantly NSTIs) had the highest median BMIs, with a trend toward less comorbid disease although over half of the subjects were diabetic. Vascular infections (predominantly prosthetic grafts infections and mycotic aneurysms) occurred in older male patients with several comorbidities (i.e., coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, and peripheral vascular disease), and almost all were inter-facility hospital transfers.\n",

            "text": "First, this is an observational study, and thus, it is difficult to differentiate causation from correlation. Second, this study was performed at a single tertiary regional medical center that receives a high number of inter-facility hospital transfers. This confounds the generalizability of the observations. For example, the vascular infections were referred due to the unique local expertise of our vascular surgery group. This was a relatively small subgroup, but they were very different in their predisposition, immune responses, and long-term outcomes. Future studies need to be done at multiple institutions so that a larger population of vascular sepsis patients can be characterized. A third limitation is that we used the 2001 consensus guidelines diagnostic criteria (referred to as Sepsis-2) as entry criteria because that was the standard when we started enrollment in 2015 [37]. In 2016, the Sepsis-3 criteria were described and have gained popularity [38]. To address concerns that we were not using Sepsis-3 definitions, we performed interim analysis of our database in 2017 and found that 7% of the study patients that were classified as sepsis by Sepsis-2 criteria would be classified as only having an infection by Sepsis-3 criteria (because of the lack of attributable organ dysfunction) [39]. However, it is important to note that these were ICU patients who had to exceed the physiologic derangement threshold quantitated by the MEWS-SRS screening tool to be entered the study. When we compared various equivalent strata of Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 cohorts, we found no significant difference in immune biomarkers, SOFA scores, inpatient clinical outcomes, discharge disposition, mortality, and long-term Zubrod performance status. The fourth limitation is the consolidation of the various types of infections into five categories. This was based on the literature and was done to simplify the analysis, but likely generated bias (as discussed above with the abdominal infections). Fifth, comorbid disease plays an important role in the predisposition and outcomes of sepsis in aging patients. We obtained comorbidity data by concurrent chart review, but a more in-depth interview with the patient/family plus specific biomarkers (such as HbA1C for diabetes) would have allowed quantitation of poor control or severity. Sixth, 30% of the patients were admitted for trauma or elective surgery and subsequently developed sepsis. Their admission insult likely placed them at increased risk for infection, caused organ dysfunctions, and altered the immune responses. Comparing these hospital-acquired infection patients to those who were admitted with infections warrants further study. Seventh, biomarkers of immune responses and organ dysfunction were measured during hospitalization and documented persistent derangements in the CCI patients, but it would be interesting to obtain these after hospital discharge to document resolution. A recent study by Yende et al. showed that a subset of sepsis patients has a persistent elevation of proinflammation and immunosuppression up to a year, and this was independently associated with poor long-term outcomes [40].",
