            "text": "Identification of the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has made it possible to work toward the development of vaccines and therapeutics that could prevent future recurrences of the disease. SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has a nearly 30,000 nucleotides long RNA genome with 11 open reading frames that encode four major structural proteins consisting of nucleocapsid, spike (S), membrane, and small envelope protein (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The S protein of SARS-CoV is a 180- to 200-kDa type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that has 20\u201327% amino acid identity with the corresponding protein of other CoVs, but unlike some is not cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. The SARS-CoV S protein mediates cell entry by binding to a cell receptor identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Li et al., 2003). An additional SARS-CoV receptor, CD209L, which also binds S has recently been identified (Jeffers et al., 2004). S is a target of neutralizing antibodies (Berry et al., 2004, He et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004) making it an important candidate for vaccine applications. Currently studied vaccine candidates for which some protection has been demonstrated in animal models include DNA (Yang et al., 2004), modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) (Bisht et al., 2004), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (Bukreyev et al., 2004) vectors that express S. Although recombinant DNA and expression vectors generally induce good cell mediated immunity, they frequently do not induce as a high an antibody response as adjuvanted proteins. Here, we demonstrate the induction of neutralizing antibody and protective immunity to SARS-CoV infection of mice induced by a soluble secreted polypeptide containing amino acids 14 to 762 of the S protein in combination with the saponin QS21 or the Ribi adjuvant MPL + TDM composed of monophosphoryl lipid A and trehalose dicorynomycolate. Both adjuvant types have been tested in phase I clinical trials of candidate vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases.",

            "text": "We considered it impractical to isolate the natural membrane-bound S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV and instead used a baculovirus/insect cell system to express an N-terminal fragment of S (nS) as a secreted glycosylated protein that could be readily purified under native conditions. The N-terminal 762 amino acids of the S protein was selected on the basis of hydrophilicity and secondary structure predictions using Kyte and Dolittle and Chou Fasman algorithms (McVector 7.2) and because it includes the region corresponding to S1 of other coronaviruses. A transfer vector was constructed in which the polyhedrin promoter regulates expression of a protein comprised of amino acids 14 to 762 of S preceded by the honeybee melittin signal peptide and followed by six histidines (Fig. 1A). A baculovirus expressing nS was derived by recombination in insect cells. The yield of secreted and affinity purified nS was approximately 10 mg/l of culture supernatant, and a single major band of \u223c110 kDa was seen by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B, lane 1) or silver nitrate (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Upon Western blotting, the same 110-kDa band was recognized by antibodies to the polyhistidine tag and SARS-CoV S protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F reduced the mobility of the protein to \u223c85 kDa, demonstrating that the higher than expected apparent mass was due to N-glycosylation (Fig. 1C).",

            "text": "To analyze immunogenicity, nS protein mixed with MPL + TDM or QS21 adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice on days 0, 28, and 56. Control mice were immunized with adjuvant and a secreted form of the vaccinia virus membrane protein L1R that was also produced in the baculovirus system and purified by affinity chromatography (Fogg et al., 2004). As an initial evaluation of immunogenicity, sera from the mice were tested for antibodies that recognize S protein expressed on the surface of cells by recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA/S) (Bisht et al., 2004). Because the endoplasmic reticulum acts as a filter for misfolded proteins, S present on the cell surface is likely to be correctly folded. Although SARS-CoV-infected cells could be used for the same purpose, considerably higher containment levels would be required. Uninfected HeLa cells or HeLa cells infected with non-recombinant MVA or MVA/S were fixed and stained with pooled mouse serum followed by Alexa 594-conjugated-anti-mouse IgG and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The serum obtained from mice immunized with nS in QS21 or MPL + TDM adjuvant stained the surface of cells infected with MVA/S but did not detectably stain uninfected cells or cells infected with non-recombinant MVA (Fig. 2\n). In contrast, serum from control mice that were immunized with the vaccinia virus L1R protein stained cells infected with non-recombinant and MVA/S equally (not shown). These data indicated that the antibodies produced by nS were able to bind to the membrane-associated form of full-length S.",

Antibody was detected after the primary inoculation of nS with QS21 and the reciprocal ELISA titer was boosted to 1:409,600 after two more inoculations (Fig. 3A). With MPL + TDM adjuvant, the antibody response to nS was detected only after boosting but subsequently reached approximately 25% of the level achieved with QS21. The IgG2a/IgG1 ratio is an indicator of Th1 help. The specific IgG2a/IgG1 titers from mice immunized with QS21 and MPL + TDM were 0.25 and 0.03, respectively, suggesting a greater Th1 response with the former adjuvant. A determining effect of adjuvant on helper T cell responses has been noted (Cribbs et al., 2003, Santos et al., 2002). For comparative purposes, we also determined the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of serum previously obtained from mice immunized with MVA/S. Although the overall IgG titers were lower in mice immunized with MVA/S (Bisht et al., 2004) than with the nS protein, the IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were higher with values of 2 and 4 for pooled sera of mice immunized intranasally and intramuscularly, respectively.",

            "text": "A recombinant polypeptide containing amino acids 14 to 762 of the SARS-CoV S protein administered with adjuvant induced neutralizing antibody and protectively immunized mice against upper and lower respiratory infections with SARS-CoV. Although the ability of a protein vaccine to protectively immunize against SARS-CoV was not previously reported, recent studies have shown that the protein segment we used contains the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-binding region (Babcock et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003) as well as immunodominant and neutralizing epitopes (He et al., 2004, Lu et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2004). The protein vaccine induced higher neutralizing antibody and more complete protection against an intranasal SARS-CoV challenge than that achieved by inoculation of mice with live SARS-CoV (Subbarao et al., 2004), MVA expressing the full-length S (Bisht et al., 2004), or DNA expressing full-length S or S lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Yang et al., 2004). The better protection achieved in this study is correlated with the higher antibody response. Although nS with either QS21 or MPL + TDM was effective, the former adjuvant induced higher binding and neutralizing antibody and better protection of the upper respiratory tract. Vaccination with QS21 also induced a more balanced helper T-cell response than MPL + TDM as indicated by the higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio. However, we attribute the greater protection with QS21 adjuvant to the higher overall antibody response since MVA/S induced a considerably higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio but was less protective than nS with QS21.",

However, the mouse model has limitations because of the absence of disease and the relatively short period of replication (Subbarao et al., 2004). Clinical illness has been reported in some monkey studies (Kuiken et al., 2003) but not in others (Bukreyev et al., 2004, McAuliffe et al., 2004). SARS-CoV has a relatively long period of replication in ferrets (Martina et al., 2003) and Weingartl et al. (2004) recently reported that a recombinant MVA expressing S did not protect ferrets but contributed to hepatitis following challenge with SARS-CoV. In that study, neutralizing antibody was produced only transiently following immunization and was not detectable at the time of challenge although it was subsequently boosted. In another study, ter Meulen et al. (2004) showed that passively administered antibody reduced the replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs of ferrets. It will be interesting to determine whether a protein subunit vaccine is capable of high and sustained antibody in ferrets or other animals that are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV.",
