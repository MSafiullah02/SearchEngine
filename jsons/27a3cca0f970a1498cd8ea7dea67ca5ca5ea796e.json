Additionally, few studies describing the presentation of 302 syndromes describe heterogeneity in their presentation. We accounted for this heterogeneity 303 by introducing wider clinical feature distributions for those syndromes which represent 304 pooled aetiological agents (e.g., ascribing high heterogeneity to \"diarrhoeal diseases,\" which 305 includes a range of pathogens, and moderate heterogeneity to most clinical features of EVD, 306 which may be caused by several distinct filovirus species). However, more consistent and 307 comprehensive reporting of clinical feature prevalence across strains and settings would 308 enable stronger accounting for heterogeneity in disease presentation. Furthermore, an advantage of our approach is its ability to exploit-rather than work 326 against-the uncertainty inherent in syndromic data from diseases with heterogeneous 327 presentations. Critically, this allows detection of diseases at population levels even before 328 any individual-level diagnosis occurs (e.g., before the development of tests for rare/novel 329 pathogens or in settings with insufficient diagnostic capacity). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

It would also be possible to estimate observation probabilities 337and predicted spillover locations of other poorly observed emerging diseases and to develop 338geographically specific case definitions. For example, application of similar methods to 339 respiratory syndromic profiles could illuminate the factors affecting detection of SARS 340 coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) outbreaks and rapidly adapt syndromic screening 341 protocols to local contexts 30 . 342 343 Spatial detectability of Ebola virus disease. 344 345 We demonstrate that filoviral diseases, along with yellow fever, represent a distinct and 346 distinguishable group of syndromes based on their estimated syndromic distances from other 347 febrile syndromes in sub-Saharan Africa. However, filoviral haemorrhagic fevers remain 348 difficult to detect based on symptoms alone due to their relative rarity. A cluster of 349 haemorrhagic fever with a high risk of mortality, for example, even with a low proportion of 350 jaundice, is more likely to be caused by yellow fever than either Marburg virus disease or 351 Ebola virus disease until well more than 20 cases have occurred. Consideration of every 352 clinical feature in our dataset-the collection of which would require extensive health system 353 coordination, universal health access, and deep clinical expertise-still only allows for 354 attribution of EVD or MVD by the sixth and seventh case, respectively. In an area 355 unaccustomed to such diseases or without adequate resources, months of transmission could 356 occur silently, such as those which complicated control of the two largest Ebola outbreaks to 357 date 31-34 . 358 359 This analysis suggests that common clinical case definitions for filovirus diseases are 360 insufficient for detection of viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, including EVD outbreaks, in 361 many parts of West and Central Africa. Clusters of clinical features caused by an EVD 362 outbreak, even if they are identified as related, are too commonly attributable to other febrile 363 symptoms. Correctly identifying EVD cases based on case definitions alone is a known 364 challenge even for Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) during ongoing outbreaks; addition of 365 more specific clinical features including conjunctivitis and diarrhoea has been shown to 366improve the accuracy of ETC triage protocols 11 .

While cross-382 validated on subsets of known spillovers and built on independent, underlying ecological data 383 (i.e., fruit bat and non-molossid microbat diversity, bat demographic patterns, and human 384 population density), such models still face fundamental challenges related to potential 385 spatially heterogeneous observation biases. More consistent ecological data collection, 386 especially related to bat abundance estimates and migratory patterns, could help overcome 387 these limitations and identify regions of high ecological spillover risk. Furthermore, it may be 388 possible to understand the hidden hotspots we identify more deeply by integrating ecological 389 and observational uncertainties into a single spillover modelling framework. 390 391 While niche maps for vector-borne diseases are somewhat more reliable, especially given 392 careful surveillance and mapping of the Aedes aegypti mosquito 36 , rarer and newer diseases 393 are still less understood. The global dengue virus map has been refined over several years 394 with an evidence-based, consensus-building process 20,37,38 , and approximates risk well, even 395 though the four circulating serotypes create a complex underlying pattern of immunity that 396 complicates predictions of infection risk and outbreak severity 39 .

These dimensions might be especially informative for ruling out arboviral 404 diseases 41,42 , but could also be informative for filoviruses as spillover drivers become clearer 405 43 . 406 407 Syndemic interactions among diseases further complicate the detection process. Ecological 408 risk factors are likely to be clustered within populations, especially for the handful of diseases 409 that share zoonotic reservoirs (EVD and MVD) or mosquito vectors (dengue, yellow fever, 410 and nearly a dozen other emerging viruses). Corresponding social risk factors-like food 411 insecurity and water storage, or limited access to primary healthcare-are also highly 412 spatially correlated, further increasing the odds that these diseases cluster together at fine 413 spatial scales. These factors compound any potential biological associations between diseases 414 44 , and resulting co-morbidities can alter clinical presentations, complicating both diagnosis 415 and treatment. This makes outbreak dynamics more complex, and potentially more severe, 416 than each disease would normally cause in isolation 15 . This is a particular problem for 417 emerging viruses, which may have poorly characterized clinical presentations and case 418 definitions for several years after emergence 45 ; failure to characterise new syndromes in full 419 can delay a national or global response by weeks or months, with strong consequences for the 420 rate of epidemic spread 1 . For example, recent work suggests that the majority of Zika cases 421 in the Americas were likely misidentified as chikungunya and dengue, long before the 422 outbreak was formally reported 46 . Recent work also suggests that official case definitions for 423 Zika by the World Health Organization miss a majority of paediatric Zika cases because the 424 case definitions target the disease's adult manifestation, which is substantially different than 425 its appearance in children 13 . Similar risks are apparent for EVD and MVD, especially in the 426 hotspots we identify. 427 428 While some of our predicted hidden hotspots overlap with recently estimated hotspots for 429 EVD epidemic risk, we introduce several new predicted areas of risk based on the difficulty 430 of detection. For example, both southeastern Guinea and northeastern Democratic Republic 431 of Congo emerged as hidden hotspots in our model, were identified as hotspots in recent 432 epidemic risk models 47,48 , and have served as the geographic origins of the two largest 433recorded Ebola epidemics. We also, however, predict EVD detection to be especially difficult 434",

However, our 441 predictions are supported by their correspondence with serosurveys and a lack of reported 442 outbreaks despite high ecological suitability 49-51 .

Similar analyses could, for example, lead to the 453 establishment of geographically adaptable case definitions that are maximally sensitive and 454 specific to their local endemic contexts.

Just as under-resourcing health systems 472 creates multiple interacting effects that allow disease to thrive, improving basic public health 473 infrastructure can have far-reaching effects. We demonstrate the benefits of diagnostic and 474 surveillance infrastructure for improving detection of emerging haemorrhagic fevers, but also 475 that supporting population health-including universal health coverage 69,70 , water and 476 sanitation infrastructure 71,72 , and strategies to address the socio-political determinants of 477 health 73,74 -has compounding benefits in terms of disease detection. By reducing endemic 478 burdens, for example, progress in these areas can make rare epidemics easier to detect (an 479indirect effect analogous to that of vaccination and sanitation for reducing antibiotic 480 overprescription and antimicrobial resistance 75 ). Furthermore, the presence of well-equipped 481 healthcare facilities and local public health officials are likely to enable reporting and control 482 measures, reducing the risk of outbreaks spreading once started. Additional research within 483 the framework we introduce could quantify these potential effects. Such holistic, system-wide 484 approaches are likely to be vital against the interconnected challenges of emerging infectious 485 Data availability.
