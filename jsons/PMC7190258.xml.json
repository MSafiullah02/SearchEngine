At this hospital, we document and store clinical data using an EHR (Epic Systems, Verona, WI). We admit patients with DKA from an emergency department (ED) either to the endocrinology ward or to the PICU with endocrinology consultation. The endocrinology ward has trained nursing staff and DKA management protocols in place. Nurse-to-patient ratios are 1:2 or 1:3, depending on the acuity and volume of patients. Our PICU had 55 beds when this project started, with additional beds being added during our project timeline. Endocrinology fellows are consulted for all patients with DKA and actively participate in the decision to either accept a patient to the endocrinology ward or recommend PICU admission, with input from an attending endocrinologist as needed. Our institution has established clinical pathway guidelines (CPG) for the management of DKA, listing criteria for PICU admission for provider reference (Fig. 1).8 This pathway is freely accessible online. Patients are admitted to the PICU if there is a need for closer monitoring or escalation of care. If we admit a patient to the endocrinology ward, but on the initial evaluation, they are deemed unstable, we would initiate a PICU consult. This consult often results in a transfer to the PICU.",

Those DKA patients with parameters in the PICU \u201cAdmission should be Considered\u201d category were not considered potentially avoidable (Fig. 1). We queried the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS), LLC database registry, to determine how many PICU DKA admissions were potentially avoidable. The VPS database registry consists of over 135 participating PICUs across the world voluntarily with a subscription fee for participation. It serves as a multi-institutional repository of PICU data. Participating PICUs receive quarterly reports that benchmark PICU composition and performance against peer PICUs. We extracted PICU admissions with a primary diagnosis of DKA using VPS-specific diagnosis codes. Data for the VPS registry were collected on all PICU patients at our institution by trained staff nurses, using standardized clinical data definitions, analysis, and quality controls, with regular assessment of staff interrater reliability. We, therefore, used the VPS database to investigate the scope and magnitude of the problem relevant to our project, as it reliably tracked every PICU patient, which the EHR was unable to do without purposeful addition of functionality and quality control of data extraction. Using the VPS registry, we calculated that at baseline, 22% of PICU admissions of patients with DKA were potentially avoidable.",

Admissions to PICU for DKA decreased slightly just after project kickoff. Discussion of CPG and prompts to consider our process could have caused changes in workflow. The numbers continued to decrease significantly post-intervention. The process of accepting a patient to the PICU is complex and influenced by many hospital, unit, personnel, and patient factors, so it is not certain that the results were due to the intervention alone. Compliance with the use of the dot-phrase never reached 100% despite the addition to the fellow trainee guidebook and e-mail reminders. The relatively low adherence could result from multiple factors. Fellows nearing the end of their training may have developed an established workflow for documentation from prior years, making it difficult for them to adopt another step. As we have previously highlighted, the hospital census was high during the study period; a higher workload for the on-call physicians could have led to fellows missing this documentation step. In the future, dot-phrase use could also be expanded to other categories of providers such as ED physicians to enhance overall use. Despite varying dot-phrase usage, there was a clear decrease in the number of patients admitted to the PICU with DKA. We observed with the provider survey that there was a knowledge gap; perhaps increased awareness closed this gap, allowing providers to make more consistent decisions by referring directly to the open-access CPG, even without documentation. The EHR, in contrast, is behind a secure firewall and requires multiple steps to log in for documentation. This barrier may have limited documentation without restricting access to the CPG when on-call remotely. Institutions with complex and limited remote access to the EHR could consider creating open-access resources for ease of reference.",
