The first WSAVA guidelines were published in 2007 ) and these were updated in 2010 (Day et al. 2010) with an accompanying document written for the owners and breeders of pet dogs and cats. Between 2011 and 2013, the VGG focused on dog and cat infectious disease and vaccinology on the Asian continent and produced regional recommendations on aspects of vaccination for Asian practitioners (Day et al. 2014) . In 2014 and 2015, the VGG has worked on updating the global canine and feline vaccination guidelines as now presented in this document.",

Herd immunity related to use of core vaccines that provide a long (many years) DOI is highly dependent on the percentage of animals in the population vaccinated and not the number of vaccinations that occur annually. Therefore, every effort should be made to vaccinate a higher percentage of cats and dogs with the core vaccines. It is simply not possible to induce 'better' immunity in an individual animal by giving repeated vaccinations, i.e. a dog receiving a core MLV vaccine every 3 years will be equally well protected compared with one receiving the same vaccine annually (Bohm et al. 2004 , Mouzin et al. 2004 , Mitchell et al. 2012 [EB1], but this may not necessarily be the case for feline core vaccines (see below).",

For these reasons we have seen the development of vaccination guidelines based on a rational analysis of the vaccine requirements for each pet, and the proposal that vaccines be considered 'core' and 'non-core' in nature. To an extent this categorization of products has been based on available scientific evidence and personal experience -but concerted effort to introduce effective companion animal disease surveillance on a global scale would provide a more definitive basis on which to recommend vaccine usage (Day et al. 2012) . In parallel with the categorization of vaccines has been the push towards marketing products with extended DOI, to reduce the unnecessary administration of vaccines and thereby further improve vaccine safety. Both of these changes have necessitated a frame-shift in the mind-set of veterinary practitioners, which is now becoming the accepted norm in many countries.",

Puppies with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until \u226512 weeks of age (Friedrich & Truyen 2000) [EB1] . No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. The recommendation of the VGG is for initial core vaccination at 6-8 weeks of age, then every 2-4 weeks until 16 weeks of age or older. Therefore the number of puppy primary core vaccinations will be determined by the age at which vaccination is started and the selected interval between vaccinations. Possible schedules are outlined in Table 5 . By this recommendation, when vaccination is started at 6 or 7 weeks of age, a course of four primary core vaccines would be administered with a 4-week interval, but only three would be required with an 8-or 9-week start and a similar 4-week interval.",

Some products are also licensed with a '10 week finish' designed such that the second of two core vaccinations is given at 10 weeks of age. The rationale behind this protocol is to permit 'early socialization' of puppies while diminishing the risk of infectious diseases. The VGG recognizes that early socialization is essential to the behavioural development of dogs (Korbelik et al. 2011 , AVSAB 2008 [EB1]. Where such protocols (i.e. 'puppy classes') are adopted, vigilance should still be maintained by the owner -allowing restricted exposure of their puppy to controlled areas and only to other puppies and adults that appear healthy and are fully vaccinated. In particular 'puppy classes' should be held in venues away from the veterinary practice. Alternatively, if it is decided that veterinary premises must be used, the floors should be cleaned and disinfected before each class and the classes held in an area not highly trafficked by dogs of unknown vaccination or disease status. A recent US study has shown the minimal risk for CPV-2 amongst vaccinated puppies attending socialization classes (Stepita et al. 2013) . The VGG recommends that whenever possible the last of the puppy primary series of core vaccines be given at 16 weeks of age or older [EB1] .",

            "text": "An integral part of core vaccination of puppies is the 'booster' vaccine that has traditionally been given either at 12 months of age or 12 months after the last of the primary series of puppy vaccines. The main aim of this vaccine is to ensure that a protective immune response develops in any dog that may have failed to respond to any of the vaccines in the primary core series, rather than necessarily 'boosting' the immune response. The delivery of this vaccine at 12 months of age is likely to have been chosen historically as a convenient time to request the owner to attend the practice for a first annual health check. This therefore implies that should an individual puppy fail to respond to any of the primary core vaccinations, that puppy may be unprotected until it receives this 12-month vaccine. This might account for occurrences of infectious disease (e.g. canine parvoviral enteritis) in a proportion of vaccinated puppies at less than 12 months of age. The VGG has re-evaluated this practice and now suggests that veterinarians might wish to reduce this possible window of susceptibility by bringing forward this vaccine from 52 weeks to 26 weeks of age (or indeed at any time point between 26 and 52 weeks of age; however, 26 weeks of age provides a convenient timing). This practice will require that pet owners clearly understand why this is recommended, because as indicated in Table 5 , adopting such a protocol will mean that vaccination started in a 6 or 7 week old puppy, might now entail up to five vaccine visits in the first 6 months of life. For core vaccines, after a 26 week 'booster', another core vaccine would not be required for at least another 3 years. This new recommendation for vaccination at 6 months of age as an alternative to vaccination at about 1 year of age is certainly not mutually exclusive to, and does not preclude, a 1-year or 16-month 'first annual health check'. Many veterinarians are understandably keen to check the animals under their care at around the time they reach skeletal maturity.",

It should be emphasized that triennial adult revaccination does not generally apply to killed core vaccines (except for rabies) nor to the non-core vaccines, and particularly not to vaccines containing bacterial antigens. Thus Leptospira, Bordetella and Borrelia (Lyme disease) products, but also parainfluenza virus components, require more frequent boosters for reliable protection (Ellis & Krakowka 2012 , Klaasen et al. 2014 , Ellis 2015 , Schuller et al. 2015 .",

Similarly, an adopted adult dog (or puppy over 16 weeks of age) of unknown vaccination history requires only a single dose of MLV core vaccine to engender a protective immune response. Many vaccine datasheets will advise in these circumstances that the dog requires two vaccinations (as for a puppy), but this practice is unjustified and contrary to fundamental immunological principles [EB4] . Note again, that this does not apply to non-core vaccines, many of which will require two doses in an adult dog. Particular mention should be made of canine rabies vaccines. The VGG recommends that in any country in which canine rabies is endemic, vaccination of dogs should be strongly recommended to clients by veterinarians, even if not required by law. Revaccination intervals for canine rabies are often mandated by law. Internationally available killed rabies vaccines were initially produced with a licensed 1-year DOI and so statutes required annual revaccination. These same products now carry a 3-year DOI in many countries, where laws have been modified to incorporate this change. However, in some countries the legal requirement is at odds with the vaccine license and in others neither the vaccine license, nor the law, has been changed. Finally, some countries also have locally-manufactured rabies vaccines with a 1-year DOI that most likely cannot safely be extended to 3 years. Veterinarians should be mindful of the law, but where they have access to a product that confers a minimum of 3-years immunity, national associations might lobby to have the laws changed to match the current scientific evidence.",

These test kits complement the traditional laboratory-based modalities (i.e. virus neutralization and haemagglutination inhibition test) that remain the 'gold standards' for serological testing. Two commercially produced test kits are available and have been applied and validated in the practice and shelter setting (Gray et al. 2012 , Litster et al. 2012 . These test kits have proven popular with veterinarians who wish to be able to offer their clients an alternative to routine core revaccination at 3-yearly intervals, but the kits remain relatively expensive and unfortunately, at present, testing costs more than a dose of vaccine. A negative test result indicates that the dog has little or no antibody, and that revaccination is recommended. Some seronegative dogs are in fact immune (false-negative) and their revaccination would be unnecessary because they would make a rapid and substantial anamnestic response to vaccination (Mouzin et al. 2004) . However, such dogs cannot be detected readily and an animal with a negative result, regardless of the test used, should be considered as having no antibody and potentially susceptible to infection.

Because immunological non-responsiveness is genetically controlled in other species, certain breeds of dogs have been suspected to be poor-responders. It is believed (but unproven) that the high susceptibility to CPV-2 recognized in certain Rottweilers and Dobermanns during the 1980s (regardless of their vaccination history) relates in part to a high prevalence of non-responders (Houston et al. 1994) [EB4]. In the USA today, these two breeds seem to have no greater numbers of non-responders to CPV-2 than other breeds, possibly because carriers of the genetic trait may have died from CPV-2 infection. Some dogs of these breeds may be low or non-responders to other antigens. For example, in the UK and Germany, the non-responder phenotype remains prevalent amongst Rottweilers [EB3] for CPV-2 and recent studies have shown this breed to have a higher proportion of animals failing to achieve the titre of rabies antibody required for pet travel (Kennedy et al. 2007) [EB1]. Some broad estimates have been made of the proportion of genetic non-responders in the canine population, these being: 1 in every 5,000 dogs for CDV, 1 in every 100,000 dogs for CAV and 1 in every 1,000 dogs for CPV-2 [EB4].",

It is known that a large majority of dogs maintain protective antibody against CDV, CPV-2, CAV-1 and CAV-2 for many years and numerous experimental studies support this observation (Bohm et al. 2004 , Mouzin et al. 2004 , Schultz 2006 , Mitchell et al. 2012 [EB1]. Therefore, when antibody is absent (irrespective of the serological test used) the dog should be revaccinated unless there is a medical reason for not so doing, even though some will be protected by immunological memory. Antibody determinations to other vaccine components are of limited or no value because of the short time period these antibodies persist (e.g. Leptospira products) or the lack of correlation between serum antibody and protection (e.g. Leptospira and canine parainfluenza) (Hartman et al. 1984 , Klaasen et al. 2003 , Ellis & Krakowka 2012 ",

In many virus infections, antibody levels are therefore taken as correlates of protection. During viraemia, pre-existing or injected antibodies directed against surface structures of virions bind to the particles, neutralize their infectivity and prepare them for removal. Therapeutically, most serum or immunoglobulin preparations used in passive immunization are injected subcutaneously (because they are from a different animal species) and quickly reach the circulation. Not unexpectedly, intravenous infusions of plasma or serum (from the same species) have been found to work as well. In local infections, such as those initiated by the bite of a rabid carnivore, post-exposure antibody prophylaxis has also proven invaluable in human medicine. Human rabies immune globulin provides rapid protection when given on the first day of the post-exposure prophylaxis regimen. As much as possible of the preparation is infiltrated into and around the wound, and may be given intramuscularly at a site distant from the rabies vaccine, which is applied simultaneously.",

However, this work has been criticised because only a small volume (12 ml) of immune plasma was given to each puppy in this study. Much larger volumes (6\u00b76-11 ml/kg) are routinely used by researchers and practitioners and these large doses are believed by some experienced clinicians and investigators to have efficacy (Dodds 2012) [EB4]. In order to have a maximal beneficial effect, immune serum or plasma must be given after infection, but prior to the onset of clinical signs. In this case administration of immune serum or plasma is best provided within 24-48 hours after infection and a large amount of high titred serum or plasma is required. The serum or plasma must be given parenterally (e.g. subcutaneously, intravenously or intraperitoneally) and not orally.

The first of these is a subunit product containing GP63 of Leishmania donovani (also known as the 'fucose mannose ligand'; FML) in saponin adjuvant. It is considered to induce antibody that blocks the transmission of the organism from the dog to the sandfly vector by preventing binding of Leishmania to the midgut of the sand fly and has been extensively evaluated in immunological and epidemiological field studies (Palatnik de Sousa et al. 2009; Palatnik de Sousa & Day 2011) [EB1]. However, this product has been recently withdrawn from the Brazilian market. The second Brazilian vaccine contains the A2 antigen from L. donovani in saponin adjuvant. This vaccine is reported to induce similar protective effects in vaccinated dogs (i.e. with respect to seroconversion, prevention of infection and clinical signs and transmission to the vector) to the FML vaccine, when both were compared in a natural exposure field trial in an endemic area over an 11 month period. Dogs vaccinated with the A2 vaccine developed a lesser humoral immune response but showed a greater frequency of adverse events post vaccination (Fernandes et al. 2014) .",

A particular example of a vaccine that may be considered core in only some countries is that against rabies virus.

            "text": "In terms of feline core vaccines it is important to realize that the protection afforded by the FCV and FHV-1 vaccines will not match the immunity provided by FPV vaccines. Thus the feline core respiratory disease vaccines should not be expected to give the same robust protection, nor the duration of immunity, that is seen with canine core vaccines. FCV vaccines have been designed to produce cross-protective immunity against multiple strains of FCV; however, it is still possible for infection and disease to occur in vaccinated adult animals (Pedersen et al. 2000 , Schorr-Evans et al. 2003 [EB1]. There is no FHV-1 vaccine that can protect against infection with virulent virus and infection may lead to the virulent virus becoming latent with the possibility of reactivation during periods of severe stress (Richter et al. 2009 , Maes 2012 [EB1]. The reactivated virus may cause clinical signs in the vaccinated animal or the virus can be shed to susceptible animals and cause disease in them. The VGG recommends triennial revaccination of low-risk cats for FHV-1 and FCV on the basis of a published study showing a minimum duration of partial, but clinically significant, immunity of 7.5 years for these core vaccines (Scott & Geissinger 1999) . A more recent study of a MLV FHV-1/FCV vaccine seemed to show much less substantial, partial protection against FHV-1 at 3 years post vaccination; although the FCV partial protection was comparable to that shown by Scott and Geissinger in1999 (Jas et al. 2015) . [EB1] . The VGG recommends that annual revaccination of cats against FHV-1/FCV be carried out in higher-risk situations. A low-risk cat might be defined as a solitary, indoor animal that does not visit a boarding cattery. A higher-risk cat might be defined as an animal that regularly visits a boarding cattery or that lives in a multicat, indoor-outdoor household. Moreover, the VGG encourages practitioners to consider the timing of administration of FHV-1/FCV vaccines to higher-risk, regularly boarding cats. The most robust immunity conferred by these vaccines occurs within the 3-month period after vaccination (Gaskell et al. 2007) [EB1], and so administration of these vaccines might best be timed for immediately before a regularly boarded cat is due to make an annual visit to the cattery.",

            "text": "The VGG has also reconsidered the FIV vaccine, which in previous iterations of these guidelines has been categorized as 'not recommended'. The basis for this categorization was: (1) questions over the cross-protection between subtypes of virus included in the vaccine and those subtypes and recombinants in the field in different geographical areas (Hosie et al. 1995 , Dunham et al. 2006 , Yamamoto et al. 2007 , Coleman et al. 2014 , Beczkowski et al. 2015a [EB1], (2) the interference of the vaccine with antibody testing used for diagnosis of FIV infection (Hosie & Beatty 2007) [EB1], and (3) the fact that this is an adjuvanted vaccine that must be given repeatedly (a primary course of three injections and annual revaccination) to a species susceptible to injection site sarcoma. The VGG is aware that in some parts of the world, there remains a significant prevalence of FIV seropositivity and/or infection (Bennett et al. 1989 , Hosie et al. 1989 , Friend et al. 1990 , Glennon et al. 1991 , Bandecchi et al. 1992 , Hitt et al. 1992 , Ueland and Lutz 1992 , Jones et al. 1995 , Hofmann-Lehmann et al. 1996 , Yilmaz et al. 2000 , Lee et al. 2002 , Muirden 2002 , Norris et al. 2007 , Gleich et al. 2009 , Ravi et al. 2010 , Bande et al. 2012 , Chang Fung Martel et al. 2013 , Rypula et al. 2014 [EB1]. There are now discriminatory serological tests (Kusuhara et al. 2007 , Levy et al. 2008 , Westman et al. 2015 and more robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the diagnosis of FIV infection (Arjona et al. 2007 , Wang et al. 2010 , Morton et al. 2012 [EB1]. In many countries, it is most unlikely that cat owners will be persuaded to keep their cats indoors, away from the major risk of FIV transmission (bites by infected cats). Disease progression in FIV-infected cats has recently been shown to be impacted by housing conditions and number of cats in the household (Beczkowski et al. 2015b) . Given that this vaccine has been shown to have efficacy in some studies, but not in others, and might benefit some at-risk populations of cats, the VGG has reclassified the product as a non-core vaccine. Kitten Vaccination and the 6-or 12-Month Booster As discussed for puppies, most kittens are protected by MDA in the first weeks of life. However, without serological testing, the level of protection and the point at which the kitten will become susceptible to infection and can respond immunologically to vaccination are unknown. This is related to the level of maternal antibody and variation in uptake of MDA between litters and individuals. In general, MDA will have waned by 8-12 weeks of age to a level that allows an active immunological response; however, kittens with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until sometime after 12 weeks of age. The VGG has reviewed recent studies suggesting that up to one third of kittens may fail to respond to a final core vaccine given at 16 weeks of age and that a proportion of kittens may still have blocking MDA at 20 weeks of age (DiGangi et al. 2012 , Jakel et al. 2012 . The VGG notes that one of these studies was of a relatively low number of animals, dominated by one breed, within a cattery setting, and suggests that the data may not be fully applicable to the wider feline population. Nevertheless, the VGG has increased the recommended age for the final vaccination in the series of primary core vaccinations from 14-16 weeks of age to 16 weeks or older [EB1] .",

Therefore the number of kitten primary core vaccinations will be determined by the age at which vaccination is started and the chosen revaccination interval. Possible schedules are outlined in Table 5 . By this recommendation, when vaccination is started at 6 or 7 weeks of age, a course of four primary core vaccines would be administered, but only three would be required with an 8-or 9-week start.",

The main aim of this vaccine is to ensure that a protective immune response develops in any cat that may have failed to respond to any of the three vaccines in the primary core series, rather than necessarily 'boosting' the immune response. The delivery of this vaccine at 12 months of age is likely to have been chosen historically as a convenient time to request the owner to attend the practice for a first annual health check. This therefore implies that should an individual kitten fail to respond to any of the three primary core vaccinations, that kitten may be unprotected until it receives this 12-month vaccine. This might account for occurrences of infectious disease in a proportion of vaccinated kittens at less than 12 months of age. The VGG has re-evaluated this practice and now suggests that veterinarians might wish to reduce this possible window of susceptibility by bringing forward this vaccine from 52 weeks to 26 weeks of age (or indeed at any time point between 26 and 52 weeks of age; however, 26 weeks of age provides a convenient timing). This practice will require that pet owners clearly understand why this is recommended, because as indicated in Table 5 , adopting such a protocol will mean that vaccination started in a 6 or 7 week old kitten, might now entail up to five vaccine visits in the first 6 months of life. For core vaccines, after a 26 week 'booster', another core vaccine would not be required for at least another 3 years (for a low-risk cat). As for puppies, adoption of the 26 week vaccination approach would not preclude a first annual health check at 12 or 16 months of age.",

The VGG recommendation for adult 'low-risk' cats is for revaccination with MLV core vaccines at intervals of 3 years or longer. For 'higher-risk' cats (see definitions above) the veterinarian might consider administering FPV vaccine no more frequently than every 3 years, but giving FCV and FHV-1 vaccines annually, with these latter products timed for administration shortly before any regular annual visit to a boarding cattery [EB1]. These recommendations do not generally apply to killed core vaccines (except for rabies) nor to the non-core vaccines, and particularly not to vaccines containing bacterial antigens. Thus Chlamydia (formerly Chlamydophila; Sachse et al. 2015) and Bordetella products, if their use is deemed necessary, require annual boosters for the limited protection afforded by these products [EB2] .",

Although the pathogenesis of FISS remains unproven, current belief is that a localized chronic inflammatory reaction initiates malignant transformation of mesenchymal cells and that this process has some genetic basis. Most subcutaneous injections (including of vaccines) have traditionally been given into the interscapular region of the cat, which remains a common site for formation of a FISS. The infiltrative nature of these tumours means that radical surgical resection is often necessary to attempt removal of these lesions although adjunctive treatment modalities are also used (Martano et al. 2011 , Ladlow 2013 .",

            "text": "In North America the response to this issue was the recommendation of a protocol whereby the two perceived high-risk adjuvanted vaccines would be administered into distinct anatomical sites that would be more amenable to surgical removal of any FISS that might develop. Accordingly the recommendation 'left leg leukaemia, right leg rabies' suggested that FeLV vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the left hindlimb, whilst rabies vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the right hindlimb. This recommendation remains in the current AAFP guidelines (Scherk et al. 2013) , which also specify administration of the three feline core vaccines into a distal forelimb. One study evaluated the effect of this practice by comparing the anatomical distribution of FISS in cats before the recommendation was made (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) and after the practice was adopted (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (Shaw et al. 2009 ). The data showed a significant decrease in the prevalence of interscapular FISS and an increase in prevalence of tumours in the right (but not left) forelimb. More notably, there was also an increase in the number of tumours reported arising in the combined regions of the right hindlimb with right lateral aspect of the abdomen (12.5% to 25.0%) and the left hindlimb with left lateral aspect of the abdomen (11.4% to 13.8%). This was attributed to the difficultly of injecting into the distal hindlimb and these abdominal sites being accidentally injected. This practice has not been widely adopted outside of North America.",

Seroconversion occurred in all cats to FPV and all but one cat for rabies virus. Tail vaccination was reported to be well tolerated by the cats in this small study. In the 2010 WSAVA vaccination guidelines, the VGG proposed the alternative of delivering vaccine into the skin of the lateral thorax, or better, the lateral abdomen (Day et al. 2010) . Tail injection may prove to be a safer alternative than distal limb injections or lateral body wall injections, but further studies of tail vaccination will be required.",

This site should be recorded in the patient's record or on the vaccination card by use of a diagram indicating which products were administered on any one occasion.

This test has now been validated and applied in a series of published investigations , Mende et al. 2014 . This test kit may be used for the determination of the presence of protective antibody against FPV as there is excellent correlation between the presence of such antibody and resistance to infection (Lappin et al. 2002) [EB1]. The FPV test kit is reported to have 89% specificity and 79% sensitivity (Mende et al. 2014) The correlation between circulating serum antibody and protection against FCV and FHV-1 infection is less robust than the presence of adequate local mucosal immunity and cell-mediated immunity, respectively. For that reason, a negative test result for FCV or FHV-1 antibody would not necessarily indicate lack of protection in a particular cat (Lappin et al. 2002) [EB1]. These tests can be applied in practice as described above for the dog: for determination of protection of kittens following FPV vaccination, for determination of protection against FPV in adult cats (in order to inform decisions about revaccination) and for use in the shelter situation in the control of outbreaks of FPV infection. It should be emphasized that antibody testing for FIV is used to diagnose disease and is of no value in determining immunity to FIV, but as discussed above, where FIV vaccine is used and FIV infection is suspected, diagnosis should be made using a discriminatory serological test or, preferably, a validated PCR test.",

Recent US studies have shown that cats entering shelters may be seropositive for vaccine-preventable infectious disease agents. DiGangi et al. (2012) reported seropositivity for FPV (60.2%), FHV-1 (89%) and FCV (63.4%) and Fischer et al. (2007) reported seropositivity for FPV (33%), FHV-1 (21%), FCV (64%) and rabies virus (3%). Seropositivity to CDV (41.2%) was less than for CPV (84.3%) in dogs entering one US shelter (Litster et al. 2012 ) and in another study 35.5% of dogs were seropositive to both CDV and CPV, 7.7% to CDV only, 31.5% to CPV only and 25.3% to neither virus (Lechner et al. 2010) . If unambiguous documentation of vaccination is provided for an adult animal at the time of admission to a shelter, there is no reason to revaccinate with canine core vaccines, but feline core vaccines, specifically FCV and FHV-1, may be of value in boosting immunity.",

It should be a requirement of entry to any such facility that the individual dog or cat is fully vaccinated with core products given according to the guidelines presented herein. In dogs, the use of non-core vaccines against respiratory infections is also appropriate under these circumstances. The VGG is aware that in some countries vaccination protocols for animals entering a boarding kennel/cattery are formulated by local authorities and may be contrary to current guidelines (e.g. insistence on annual revaccination). The VGG encourages such authorities to reconsider these recommendations in light of current scientific thinking and product availability and encourages the veterinary profession and national associations to lobby for such change.",

The importance of dental care, proper nutrition, appropriate diagnostic testing and the control of parasites and of zoonotic diseases should be addressed during evaluation of each pet.

Puppy/kitten programs have traditionally focused on vaccinations, parasite control and neutering. Today, opportunity exists to incorporate behaviour counselling and zoonotic disease management. For the ageing pet, senior care programs are becoming increasingly popular. Nutritional, dental disease and parasite control assessment and counselling should take place on an individualized basis throughout the life of the pet. There is no evidence that older dogs and cats, which have been fully vaccinated as pups or kittens, require a specialized programme of core vaccination (Day 2010 , Horzinek 2010 . Experimental evidence shows that older dogs and cats have persisting immunological memory to core vaccines, as detected by measurement of serum antibody, and that this may be readily boosted by administration of a single vaccine dose (Day 2010) [EB1]. In adult animals, decisions about revaccination with most core products (CDV, CAV and CPV and FPV) may be made via serological testing. Practitioners who offer this alternative to vaccination report that it is greatly appreciated by owners who may have concerns about vaccination frequency and offering this alternative acts as a 'practice builder'. By contrast, aged animals may not be as efficient at mounting primary immune responses to novel antigens that they have not previously encountered (Day 2010) [EB1]. Studies of UK dogs and cats vaccinated for the first time against rabies for pet travel have clearly shown that more aged animals fail to achieve the legally required antibody titre (Kennedy et al. 2007) [EB1].",

They include any injury, toxicity or hypersensitivity reaction associated with vaccination, whether or not the event can be directly attributed to the vaccine. Adverse events should be reported, whether their association with vaccination is recognized or only suspected. A vaccine adverse event report should identify the product(s) and animal(s) involved in the event(s) and the individual submitting the report. Reporting field observations of unexpected vaccine performance is the most important means by which the manufacturer and the regulatory agency are alerted to potential vaccine safety or efficacy problems that may warrant further investigation. The purpose of pre-licensure safety studies is to detect relatively common adverse events. Rare or delayed adverse events will be detected only by postmarketing surveillance through analysis of reported adverse events. Adverse events should be reported to the manufacturer and/or the local regulatory authority. In many countries governmental surveillance schemes are not available and reactions should therefore be notified to the manufacturer. The VGG recognizes that there is gross under-reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events, because of the passive nature of reporting schemes, which impedes knowledge of the ongoing safety of these products [EB4] . The VGG would actively encourage all veterinarians to participate in such surveillance schemes.",

E27 APPENDICES FACT SHEET: CANINE PARVOVIRUS TYPE 2 (CPV-2) VACCINES Types of Vaccines Available Modified Live Virus (MLV) Vaccines: There are three contemporary variants of CPV-2, which are referred to as CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The original CPV-2 variant is rarely isolated nowadays, although it is still present in some modified live vaccines and can be shed from vaccine recipients. The most recent variant to emerge is CPV-2c and this genotype is recognized in North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia (Ohneiser et al. 2015) . All genotypes are antigenically related; challenge studies have shown that vaccination of dogs with current CPV vaccines containing either CPV-2 or CPV-2b will provide protective immunity against all the other variants, including CPV-2c (Spibey et al. 2008 , Decaro & Buonavoglia 2012 . Conversely, there is one report of an outbreak of CPV-2c infection in vaccinated adult dogs (Decaro et al. 2008) . These dogs had been vaccinated at 42, 57 and 90 days of age and the adults had received annual boosters. Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines: Only a few killed CPV-2 vaccines are available; they are less effective and take much longer to induce an immune response when compared with the MLV vaccines (Pollock & Carmichael 1982b) . They are not recommended for routine use. Killed vaccines may provide some benefit in wild and exotic species or pregnant bitches, where some MLV vaccines are not recommended. However, killed CPV-2 vaccines have not been tested for safety or efficacy in these situations.",

Any unexplained aggressive behaviour or sudden behavioural change must be considered suspicious. \u2022 The disease manifests itself as a 'furious' or a 'dumb' form. Signs of the classical 'furious' form of rabies include reduced palpebral, corneal and pupillary reflexes, strabismus, dropped jaw, salivation, pica, seizures, twitching, tremors, disorientation, aimless pacing, aimless snapping and biting, exaggerated emotional responses (irritability, rage, fear), photophobia, as well as ataxia and paralysis, ultimately followed by coma and death from respiratory arrest. The 'dumb' form of rabies is more common in dogs than cats and presents as lower motor neuron paralysis that progresses from the site of the bite injury to involve the entire central nervous system. The paralysis rapidly leads to coma and death from respiratory failure. \u2022 In the environment, the virus quickly loses infectivity, and is readily inactivated using detergent-based disinfectants.",

Yes, particularly canine vaccines against the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) and feline vaccines against upper respiratory disease caused by FCV and FHV-1.You should be careful to give the product by the route for which it is intended. If you use the parenteral (i.e. subcutaneous) MLV vaccines containing FCV and FHV-1 locally (i.e. intranasally or orally), you could cause serious disease in the cat. If you use the killed FCV and FHV-1 vaccines locally, you would not get any immunity and might cause significant adverse reactions. If you gave the intranasal live CIRDC vaccine parenterally, you could cause a severe necrotizing local reaction and even kill the dog, while giving the parenteral killed Bordetella vaccine intranasally will not immunize and may cause a hypersensitivity reaction.However, both types of products can be given at the same time or at various times in the life of the animal. Vaccinating both parenterally and intranasally may actually provide better immunity than vaccinating at only one site (Reagan et al. 2014 , Ellis 2015 . Thus parenteral vaccination provides protection in the lung, but little or no immunity in the upper respiratory tract (especially local secretory IgA and CMI), while intranasal vaccination will engender good secretory IgA and local CMI and non-specific immunity (e.g. type-I interferons), but will not always provide immunity in the lung. 7. How long after vaccination does it take for the dog to develop immunity that will prevent severe disease when the core vaccines are used? This is dependent on the animal, the vaccine and the disease.The fastest immunity is provided by MLV and recombinant canarypox virus vectored CDV vaccines. The immune response starts within minutes to hours and provides protection within a day to animals without interfering levels of MDA and in dogs that are not severely immunosuppressed.Immunity to CPV-2 and FPV develops after as few as 3 days and is usually present by 5 days when an effective MLV vaccine is used. In contrast, the killed CPV-2 and FPV vaccines often take 2 to 3 weeks or longer to provide protective immunity.CAV-2 MLV given parenterally would provide immunity against CAV-1 in 5-7 days. However, when given intranasally, the same level of immunity to CAV-1 is not present until after 2 or more weeks and in some dogs it doesn't develop. Thus parenteral CAV-2 is recommended for immunity to CAV-1.Time from vaccination to immunity is difficult to determine for FCV and FHV-1 because some animals will not develop protective immunity. However, when it does develop, it takes 7-14 days (Lappin 2012) .",

Similarly we would expect a very high protection from infection.For the properly vaccinated cat that had received MLV vaccines, we would estimate that \u226598% would be protected from disease and infection with FPV. In contrast, we can expect FCV and FHV-1 vaccines, at best, to protect from disease, not infection, especially in a highly contaminated environment (e.g. shelter) and protection would be seen in 60 to 70% of recipients in a high risk environment. Protection would appear to be much higher in the household pet cat isolated from other cats or with cats that have been vaccinated and in the household for a long time because the risk for infection with the viruses is so much lower, as is the stress level. 9. Are there mutants (biotypes or variants) of CDV or CPV-2 in the field that the current vaccines cannot provide protective immunity against? Not as far as we know. This is not controversial for CDV. All of the current CDV and CPV-2 vaccines provide protection from all the known isolates of CDV or CPV-2, respectively, when tested experimentally as well as in the field. However, there is one report of an outbreak of CPV-2c in Italian dogs that were vaccinated with a MLV vaccine (Decaro et al. 2008) .

Certain CPV-2 vaccines with higher viral titres (i.e. mass of virus in the vaccine ampoule) and/or with more immunogenic isolates (regardless of variant) will immunize quite a few weeks earlier than other standard CPV-2 vaccines.Journal of Small Animal Practice \u2022 Vol 57 \u2022 January 2016 \u2022 \u00a9 2016 WSAVA E35 13. When a Leptospira vaccine (bacterin) is used, should it be a product with two serogroups or one with more than two serogroups (e.g. three or four component products available in some countries)? When a Leptospira vaccine is used in high risk dogs, the commercial vaccine that contains all of the serogroups that cause disease in the dog in that region, if available, should be used. In many countries there is insufficient knowledge of which serogroups are circulating in the canine population. The VGG would encourage collection of such data.14. Do Leptospira vaccines give long term (e.g. years) immunity and are they highly effective, like the core viral vaccines? No. Leptospira vaccines provide relatively short-term immunity. Also, some Leptospira products prevent clinical disease, but fail to protect against infection and shedding of the bacteria, especially when infection occurs more than 6 months after vaccination. Persistence of antibody after vaccination will often be only for a few months and immunological memory for protective immunity is relatively short (e.g. 1 year).15. Do any feline leukaemia virus vaccines (e.g. killed adjuvanted, subunit, recombinant) provide protection with only one dose of vaccine? No. All feline leukaemia virus vaccines require a minimum of two doses of vaccine. The two doses should preferably be given 2-4 weeks apart, starting at 8 weeks of age or older. Only after that initial series of two vaccines can you then give a single dose to boost the response. When the interval between the initial two doses exceeds 6 weeks or more, it is recommended that the cat be revaccinated, making certain that two doses be given at an interval of 2-4 weeks.",

The development of an adverse reaction is often dependent on the genetics of the animal (e.g. small breed dogs or families of dogs) (Moore et al. 2005 , Kennedy et al. 2007 ). It has been suggested that bacterins (killed bacterial vaccines), such as Leptospira, Bordetella, Borrelia and Chlamydia are more likely Journal of Small Animal Practice \u2022 Vol 57 \u2022 January 2016 \u2022 \u00a9 2016 WSAVA E43 to cause type I hypersensitivity adverse reactions than MLV viral vaccines, but evidence to support this is lacking. It has been suggested that adjuvanted FeLV and rabies vaccines are more likely to be associated with feline injection site sarcoma, but again, there is conflicting evidence. 92. Should dogs and cats with a history of adverse reaction or immune-mediated diseases (e.g. hives, facial oedema, anaphylaxis, injection site sarcoma, autoimmune disease etc.) be vaccinated? If the vaccine suggested to cause the adverse reaction is a core vaccine, a serological test can be performed and if the animal is found to be seropositive (antibody to CDV, CAV, CPV-2, FPV) revaccination is not necessary. If the vaccine is an optional non-core vaccine (e.g. Leptospira or Bordetella bacterin) revaccination is discouraged. For rabies, the local authorities must be consulted to determine whether the rabies vaccine is to be administered by law or whether antibody titre may be determined as an alternative.If vaccination is absolutely necessary then switching product (manufacturer) may be helpful. However, this strategy may not always be successful since hypersensitivity reactions are known to be related to excipients contained within the vaccine (e.g. traces of bovine serum albumin used in the virus culture process) which are common to many different products. The use of antihistamines or anti-inflammatory doses of glucocorticoid pre-revaccination is acceptable and does not interfere with the vaccinal immune response. Revaccinated susceptible animals should be closely monitored for up to 24 hours post-vaccination although such reactions (Type I hypersensitivity) generally occur within minutes of exposure. Other types of hypersensitivity (II, III or IV) can occur much later (e.g. hours to months).",

This, and other commercial vaccines now often contain reduced concentrations of excipients (see Q92) and it is the reduction in concentration of extraneous protein that is likely more important in reducing adverse events.",

Determining the frequency of adverse reactions relies upon the veterinarian or owner reporting such reactions to the manufacturer or national authority (where such routes exist). It is currently accepted that the vaccines that we use are very safe with a very low incidence of side effects. The benefits of protection from serious infectious disease far outweigh the risks of developing an adverse reaction. Recent analysis of a major US hospital group database has allowed publication of data based on very large numbers of vaccinated dogs and cats. Adverse reactions (of any kind, including very minor reactions) were documented within the first 3 days following vaccination in 38 of 10,000 vaccinated dogs (Moore et al. 2005) . Adverse reactions (of any kind, including very minor reactions) were documented within the first 30 days following vaccination in 52 of 10,000 vaccinated cats (Moore et al. 2007) . However, some animals may have had reactions that were not reported to the practice, but were reported to other practices or emergency practices where the animal was seen. Some breeds and families of pets may have a higher risk of adverse reactions than the general population of animals.",

As part of vaccine licensing manufacturers are required to prove that this cannot occur if the vaccine virus is shed. MLV vaccines are called 'infectious vaccines' because they work by inducing a low level of infection (and virus replication) in the dog, sufficient to induce immunity, but not disease. In the case of canine parvovirus, vaccinated dogs might shed the MLV vaccine strain of virus in the faeces for a short period after vaccination. This does not pose a risk to other dogs.107. Some pups were vaccinated at 6 weeks of age with DHPPi and developed parvovirus infection at 7 weeks of age; why did this happen? The most common reason for this occurrence (i.e. infection in a vaccinated pup) is that the animal was already incubating infectious virus before it was vaccinated. It is possible that these pups might have been infected during the 'window of susceptibility' when they no longer had sufficient MDA to fully protect them against virulent street virus, but the MDA that was present was still sufficient to interfere with their immune response to a recently administered vaccine.",

For dogs and cats this is in the order of 30 to 50 reactions for every 10,000 animals vaccinated, respectively, and the vast majority of these are non-serious reactions (e.g. transient pyrexia Journal of Small Animal Practice \u2022 Vol 57 \u2022 January 2016 \u2022 \u00a9 2016 WSAVA E45 and lethargy, allergic reactions). However, if a serious reaction occurs in one of your client's animals -that is a difficult discussion to have. Adoption of new guidelines is not simply about minimizing the risk of adverse reactions -it is about practicing better, evidencebased veterinary medicine and only performing a medical procedure (i.e. vaccination) when this is required.109. Some dogs are genetically poor responders (e.g. Rottweilers). How should one vaccinate these breeds?The WSAVA guidelines contain a useful flow diagram that helps you to identify non-responder dogs. All puppies should be vaccinated in the same way (with a final vaccination at 16 weeks of age or older) and if you are concerned about the breed and the potential for lack of response, you should serologically test at 20 weeks of age. Most non-responders will fail to seroconvert to just one of the core vaccine antigens (i.e. CDV, CAV or CPV-2). You may attempt to revaccinate and retest that dog, but a true non-responder (or low-responder) may still not respond to revaccination. Such animals simply lack the immunological ability to make an immune response to that particular antigen and will never respond to that vaccine component. Owners should be made aware that these dogs will be at risk, and ideally they should not be used for breeding.",
