There is significant morbidity associated with late preterm birth with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB) the commonest [4, 5]. Compared with term infants, late preterm infants are nine times more likely to be placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), five times more likely to be placed on mechanical ventilation and forty two times more likely to need surfactant replacement [6]. The cost associated with the care of late preterm infants is substantial, corresponding to more than 208 million dollars annually in Canada [7].",

Although placental dysfunction is a hallmark of preeclampsia, the disorder is heterogeneous [10]. Based on gestational age at onset of disease, preeclampsia is classified as early, occurring before 34 weeks gestation and late occurring at or after 34 weeks of gestation [10, 11]. Both have similarities and distinct features. Placental changes are more marked in early onset preeclampsia while maternal factors such as increased body mass index (BMI) and metabolic syndrome play a greater role in late onset disease [12]. Early onset preeclampsia is also associated with a greater adverse impact on maternal and fetal health [13]. Although early onset disease manifests before 34 weeks gestation, a third of women deliver at or after 34 weeks gestation [12, 14]. Surprisingly, reports of the effects preeclampsia on outcomes of late preterm infants have not differentiated between early and late onset preeclampsia, despite significant differences between the two. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of early and late onset preeclampsia on the outcomes of late preterm infants, with the primary objective being respiratory outcomes.",

Proteinuria was defined as \u22650.3 g protein in a 24 h urine sample. When a 24 h urinary sample was not feasible, or \u226530 mg/mmol urinary creatinine in a spot urine sample or \u22651 + on a urinary dipstick test-strip was used as criteria for proteinuria [19]. Early onset preeclampsia was onset of symptoms at <34 weeks gestation and late onset preeclampsia onset of symptoms \u226534 weeks gestation. Histological chorioamnionitis was defined as infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the fetal membranes and chorionic plate, and funisitis as the presence of these cells in the umbilical cord blood vessel walls and Wharton\u2019s jelly [20]. Antenatal steroids were considered a course if more than twelve hours had elapsed after the first dose [21]. Diabetes included both gestational and pregestational forms of the disease. Gestational age was based on a first trimester ultrasound and date of embryo transfer in cases of in vitro fertilization. Surfactant was administered when oxygen requirements were persistently >30%. Exclusion criteria included infants born with any congenital malformations or chromosomal anomalies, infants of mothers with chronic hypertension (onset before 20 weeks of gestation), maternal renal, cardiovascular, endocrine or autoimmune disease, substance abuse, and TORCH infections. Women who did not have a first trimester ultrasound were also excluded.",

Categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact test as appropriate. Bonferroni correction was used post hoc for multiple comparisons. To identify risk factors for development of the primary outcome, multivariable ordered logistic regression with backward elimination approach was performed. Any risk factors that demonstrated associations, whether statistically significant or judged to be clinically significant, with both preeclampsia and the primary outcome but were not intermediate variables, were included in the modeling process as possible confounders [22]. The least significant variables were then removed until all remaining variables were significant at P value of 0.2. The P value of 0.2 was set conservatively as an entry for variables to proceed to the next step in the analysis [23]. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data were analyzed using STATA v. 13 (College Station, Texas, USA).",

These conflicting results are, we believe, due to investigators not differentiating between late preterm infants of early and late onset preeclampsia. Gouyon et al., using a large cohort from France, reported higher risk of severe respiratory morbidity, in late preterm infants of mothers with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy [9]. As in our study, severe respiratory morbidity was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation and/or CPAP. Habli et al., in a secondary analysis of the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention trial, investigated neonatal outcomes of infants born at 35\u201337 weeks of gestation to hypertensive and normotensive women [24]. Respiratory morbidity, defined by the need for oxygen, CPAP or mechanical ventilation was higher at each gestational age in infants of hypertensive mothers but reached statistical significance only at 37 weeks. Lagenveld et al. compared outcomes of late preterm infants of mothers with preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and normotensive pregnancies in a large cohort from the Netherlands [25]. They found higher rates of hypoglycemia and SGA in the preeclampsia group, results similar to our study. The odds of RDS were lower in the preeclampsia group with no difference in TTNB and need for oxygen. However, the study did not have data on antenatal corticosteroid use, systolic blood pressure was not used in the definition of preeclampsia and 30% of the cohort was excluded because of missing data. Masoura et al. reported increased rates of hypoglycemia and RDS and lower Apgar scores in late preterm infants of preeclamptic mothers [26]. In a study from Australia, of infants 30\u201336 weeks gestation, ventilator support was required significantly more in infants of mothers with preeclampsia [27]. As in other studies, no distinction was made between early and late onset preeclampsia.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate increased TTNB in late preterm infants of both early and late onset preeclampsia and increased RDS in early onset preeclampsia. In addition, the use of surfactant CPAP and mechanical ventilation was higher in late preterm infants of mothers with preeclampsia, with higher rates in infants of mothers with early onset preeclampsia. As primary CPAP is associated with better respiratory outcomes compared with elective intubation, nine of the fifteen infants placed on mechanical ventilation were initially tried on CPAP but had to be intubated because of worsening respiratory status and increasing oxygen requirements [28]. Of these nine patients, six were from the early onset, two from the late onset and one from the normotensive group. Increased respiratory morbidity in preterm infants of mothers with preeclampsia can potentially be explained by the antiangiogenic state in preeclampsia. Several studies have demonstrated higher levels of anti-angiogenic factors, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble Endoglin and lower levels of angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and placental growth factor in preeclampsia [10, 29\u201332]. VEGF plays a key role in lung vascular development, which promotes alveolar growth, and also enhances surfactant protein production [33, 34]. In animal models, VEGF prevents RDS and higher levels of sFlt1 and lower levels of VEGF are described in more severe RDS [35\u201337]. Importantly, this antiangiogenic state is much more pronounced in early onset preeclampsia with levels of sFlt much higher and levels of VEGF much lower in early onset preeclampsia as compared with late onset preeclampsia [38, 39]. In addition, in early onset preeclampsia the fetus is exposed to the hostile intrauterine antiangiogenic environment for a longer period. These factors may be responsible for the worse respiratory outcomes in late preterm infants of mothers with early onset preelampsia as compared with infants of mothers with late onset preeclamsia and normotensive mothers. A negative correlation between sFlt1 levels and birthweight is reported in preeclampsia, with higher sFlt1 levels associated with lower birthweight [38, 40]. In our cohort, the lower birthweight in infants of preeclamptic mothers, more marked in the early onset group, can conceivably be attributed to this negative correlation.",

We had a well-defined cohort from a recent era with little or no missing data and detailed demographic characteristics that affect outcomes, especially respiratory outcomes in late preterm infants. This included antenatal steroid use and chorioamnionitis, data that is missing from most studies. Importantly, our gestation was based on first trimester ultrasound or the date of embryo transfer in cases of IVF, largely limiting misclassification of gestation. In addition, health care in Canada is universal, negating the effect of socioeconomic status and differing antenatal and postnatal care on outcomes. However, there are limitations of our study. We did not investigate outcomes like intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or retinopathy of prematurity, which some studies have reported. These outcomes are, however, extremely uncommon in late preterm infants and an extremely large cohort would be needed to study them.
