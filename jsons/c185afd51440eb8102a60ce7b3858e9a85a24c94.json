We determined the impact of real-time PCR, additional to DIF, on antibiotic prescription in ventilated children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Methods: First, a multicenter survey study was performed. Subsequently, in a prospective study, children ( 5 years) with LRTI were tested at admission by DIF and PCR. Positive DIF results were reported at the end of the first working day. PICU physicians reported antibiotic treatment on the second working day. After informing them of the PCR result antibiotic treatment was reevaluated. Results: The multicenter survey study (94 respondents) showed that PCR decreased antibiotic use (P < 0.001). In the prospective study 38 children were included, of which 19 (50%) were DIF positive. Of the 19 DIF negative patients 12 (63%) were treated with antibiotics before revealing the PCR result; the PCR test was positive in 9 out of 12. Revealing PCR results did not alter antibiotic treatment. In 7 DIF negative patients antibiotics not given, the PCR test was positive.

Although physicians indicated that real-time PCR would have an effect on antibiotic use in the survey study, this effect was not found in practice in the prospective study. Conventional rapid viral tests such as antigen detection by DIF are now being replaced by more sensitive, molecular assays such as real-time PCR. This has led to an increase in the detection of viruses, 18,27-29 with a substantial increase in costs. 22 To determine if real-time PCR theoretically could influence daily practice at the PICU, first a multicenter survey study was performed.

First, the number of evaluated PICU children in the prospective study was relatively small. However, realtime PCR did not influence antibiotic prescription in one single patient. Therefore, we believe that the inclusion of additional patients is not likely to influence our observation that the impact of real-time PCR is minor. Second, the fact that physicians were aware of the study may have influenced their decision on antibiotic prescription. However, this would probably have led to an overestimation of the effect of real-time PCR results on antibiotic use which would only make the conclusion of our study stronger. Third, the turn around time of real-time PCR in our study was between 16 and 24 hr and PCR was performed on working days, so the results were available only at the second working day. Possibly, if results had been available earlier this could have had more effect on antibiotic prescription practices (physicians will probably be more reluctant to stop antibiotic treatment than not to start it). However, we aimed to evaluate the impact of real-time PCR in daily practice, and in most hospitals both DIF and real-time PCR are only performed on working days (i.e., Monday-Friday) with the same turn around times for both tests. 30 In agreement with previous studies we showed that realtime PCR increased the diagnostic yield considerably when compared to DIF. The proportion of virus-infected children increased from 50% (DIF) to 92% (real-time PCR), and the number of viruses from a total of 19 (all RSV) to 46 (8 different types). This increased diagnostic yield was not, however, accompanied by a decrease in antibiotic prescription. This finding is in contrast with our survey study in which real-time PCR decreased the percentage of antibiotic description by 16-42% (absolute reduction; P < 0.001 for all cases). Apparently, the treatment of paper patients is not the same as treating patients in daily PICU practice, in which physicians seem to prefer to stay on the safe side. In daily practice, physicians seem to make clinical decisions on other grounds than results from diagnostic investigations. Reasons for not stopping antibiotic treatment in PCR positive patients were the clinical suspicion of a (secondary) bacterial super infection, and the fact that the results of bacterial cultures were still unknown. Additional to the lack of effect of real-time PCR on antibiotic use found in this study, one may wonder what the effect of any viral test such as DIF may be, since a considerable proportion of patients (47%) received antibiotics regardless of a positive DIF result.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1312, "end": 1314, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pediatric Pulmonology"}, {"text": "Previous studies on the impact of rapid viral testing on antibiotic use in children have been published.
