Are the hospitals used in the study primary, secondary or tertiary hospitals? 3. Please clarify your case definition. Were patients with pneumonia on CXR but without two of the listed symptoms included in the study? Were acute and chronic infections included? If only acute, how did you define this? What about readmissions? Did you include these? Who categorised the patients into the four groups? The attending physician? It's unclear if the attending physicians are the researchers? 4. You describe symptoms associated with HMPV infection. Symptoms are usually described by the patient whereas signs are elicited by the medical practitioner. Your description of \"symptoms\" includes signs e.g. abnormal pulmonary breath sounds (determined by auscultation by the physician) and diagnoses (determined by the physician e.g. bronchopneumonia). It would be better to separate out symptoms from signs and diagnoses made by the attending physician. Throughout the manuscript the word \"symptoms\" is used to describe signs and diagnoses. Please amend throughout, including Table 2 . 5. Some of the symptoms are difficult to assess in young children e.g. pharyngeal discomfort. Your category of \"influenza-like symptoms\" includes chills, dizziness, headache and myalgiahow were these assessed in a young child? What is meant by \"expectoration\"? 6. Who gets a CXR? Some of the patients seem to have been included based on a CXR diagnosis of pneumonia. 7. You mention that samples are taken as standard of care. Who gets a swaball children with respiratory symptoms? Only hospitalised children or outpatients as well? When is the swab taken? What pathogens are routinely tested for? 8. 5133 swabs were collected. Where there any children who did not have a swab collected? Any children excluded? 9. Why could data on the HMPV-negative patients not be collected? Or even on a subset of them? You state that you have a large sample size yet data were only collected on 103 HMPV-positive patients.",

How to prove a male predominance? Response: Thanks for your effort to help revise this MS, there is a mistake in our writing draft. The result showed no gender difference in HMPV-infection patients, and the sentence has been revised as: \"Moreover, our findings suggested no gender predominance, there was no significant difference in the HMPV positive rate between males and females (p=0.771)\u2026\u2026\" (line 226-228) 3. The line 243 to 244, suggesting that fever was the key clinical presentation caused by HMPV infection. The evidence was weak. Alternatively, the authors can change to another state. Response: The description has revised as: \"Most of the HMPV-positive patients had a fever (88.1%, 89/101); it appeared in the single HMPV-positive patients more frequently than in the co-pathogens-positive patients (p=0.037)\". (line 266 to268) 4. What is the major difference between this study and the other previous studies in HMPV epidemiology? Response: The prevalence of viruses varies widely because of factors such as geographical, climatic, crowd, social activity and so on. HMPV epidemiology in the temperate regions and in developed countries has a better description. In this work, we found that the seasonal distribution of HMPV in Guangzhou, a subtropical region, was different from the previous reports, mostly found in February 2016, March 2014, and May 2015 ( Figure 2) . A wider age distribution (3 months to 5 years old) was also found in this work.",
