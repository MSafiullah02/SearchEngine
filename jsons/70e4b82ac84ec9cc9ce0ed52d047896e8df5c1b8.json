It is delivered with the Servo-I/U ventilator (Getinge, Germany) with NIV NAVA software. A specialized nasogastric tube is placed at the level of the crural diaphragm and embedded electrodes detect the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). Positive pressure is then delivered for the duration of, and in proportion to, the amount of electrical activity detected. The NAVA level is a proportionality constant that converts the Edi into a delivered inspiratory pressure above PEEP [6] . If the neonate becomes apneic for a predetermined amount of time (apnea time), pressure control backup ventilation is provided until spontaneous ventilation, as detected by the Edi, resumes. Setting the NAVA level at 0 cmH 2 O/mcV when on NIV NAVA (NN0), as seen in Fig. 3 , has been proposed as an alternate method to deliver CPAP with backup ventilation in neonates who are failing CPAP due to AOP [5, 7] .

Our study suggests it may be possible to treat CSE with a less invasive strategy that provides CPAP (NN0) when the neonate is breathing and noninvasive ventilation only when apneic.

Knowing this information would allow determination if the neonates were having brief respiratory pauses (frequent switches to backup but minimal time in backup) or apnea (few switches to backup but longer periods in backup). Another limitation is the lack of randomization of treatment epochs between CPAP and NN0. This would address the possibility that the decrease in CSE is due to 24 h of maturation in these neonates and a similar result could have been noted if the neonates had remained on CPAP. It is also possible that it was not NN0 itself but a change to another mode of ventilatory support that resulted in improvement in number of CSEs.
