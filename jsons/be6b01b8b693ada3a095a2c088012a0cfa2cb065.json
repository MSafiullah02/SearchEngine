To advance the diagnostic method of COVID-19, we developed a CRISPR/Cas12a-based assay with a naked eye readout, CRISPR/Cas12a-NER. The assay can detect as few as 10 copies of the virus gene in 45 min without a special instrument and has good consistency with the qPCR assay, providing a simple and reliable on-site diagnostic method suitable for a local hospital or community testing.",
