The number and size of the communities evolve over time and are primarily subjected to a single free parameter. Surprisingly, under some circumstances, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures-branches and leaves of a tree. Results also show that new communities will absorb a link resource to weaken the degree growth of hub nodes. Our models have a common explanation for the community of regular and tree-like networks and also breaks the tyranny of the early adopter; unlike the standard popularity principle, newer nodes and communities will come to dominance over time.

Evolving network generation models are important as they offer an explanation of both how and why complex networks (and scale-free networks, in particular) are ubiquitous. However, the motivation and manifestation of \"popularity,\" the other key to the BA model, are often rather ambiguous for natural networks. We also argue that the \"rich-get-richer\" principle is not necessarily sufficient or ubiquitous across all phenomena in all biological, social, and physical networks or particularly in engineering networks. Moreover, the growth of mesoscale network structures-communities-remains not fully understood. Here, we develop a growing network model with new communities for regulating the degree distribution, and new communities will absorb link resources to weaken the degree growth of hub nodes. Interestingly, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures-the branches and leaves of a tree. Results show that our models have a common explanation for the community of regular and tree-like networks and can also regulate degree distributions via a free parameter. We show that our model is also capable of replicating the features of real biological systems-it can construct a network that has a similar structure to the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network.",

In one recent study, it was shown that the scale-free network is rare. 13 In this report, we argue that time evolution is the key for any network model, but the birth time of a node should not entirely preordain its final state. While the first mover advantage is an advantage, it is not sufficient to guarantee final success-sometimes better ideas will appear later. In particular, the degree distribution of growing engineering networks is usually influenced by both geography and resource-driven demand; hence, links cannot be predicted well via an algorithm that is based solely on the principle of pure preferential attachment. 15, 16 On the other hand, communities appear in many complex networks and are frequently associated with important functions of those networks. [17] [18] [19] [20] Research into community detection also has recently attracted increasing attention. 21, 22 Actually, the appearance of new communities will pillage the degree resource from old hub nodes, as the links within communities are denser than those between groups, 17 and a new hub node is easily formed with the new community.",

First, we construct a fully connected network, and every node is one initial community. Second, we evaluate the probability that generates a new community or choose a community by the same probability mass function. Third, we introduce a new node that connects nodes within the new or chosen community with a higher probability and external nodes of that with a lower probability.

Hence, the label i of the new community is c + 1, where c is the number of old communities. Otherwise, introduce a new node as a member of an old community. The community to be chosen is decided by its label number i; the bigger i means the later birth. In other words, the probability that a particular community is chosen is determined by its age, inversely proportional to P inverse . The later born community is easy to be chosen with the bigger \u03b2 then forming more communities. (4) Next, the new node has a probability p to connect its own community nodes and 1 \u2212 p to randomly connect to other community nodes. Here, p can be 1; due to the community, the first node has connected the node from other communities at step 2. If the number of nodes within a community is not enough to be connected by its new node, let the new node first connect all nodes within the community randomly and then connect the external nodes randomly. Time is the key power in the BA model, the birth time determines the popularity of nodes, and the popularity of a node determines accretion of links. Hence, the richer get richer and the link resource distribution becomes more unequal. However, our model introduces the control parameter \u03b2 to create new communities to get the resource and also controls both new and old communities to share the resource, in contrast to a mechanism in which high degree nodes absorb more links over time.",

In this report, we adopt the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary data 25 as a real-world network, a node stands for one kind of a haplotype or a medium vector, and a link stands for an evolutionary relationship between two connected nodes. The SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network with 5 groups (communities) has 59 nodes (58 haplotypes and one medium vector mv2) and 59 links before 4 February 2020. Here, in the SARS-Cov-2 network, we observe that the root node in each community is the hub node with the highest degrees; hence, we set that a new node connects the oldest node within the same community with a 90% probability. As depicted in Fig. 6 , when we set \u03b2 = min(n i ) to avoid a large number of communities, n = 59. Our model can construct a network that has the same number of communities, the lowest degree, and the maximum depth of the tree within a community as the real evolutionary network. Furthermore, as shown in Table II , our model network 33 has the similar modularity value, the predictability value, and the highest degree as that of the real network. Results show that our model can fit well with the real-world evolving network that has new communities. In addition, we can also see that the Barabasi-Albert (BA) 11 network cannot grow communities [ Fig. 6(c) ], and the highest degree value (18) is far less than that of the real network (30) .
