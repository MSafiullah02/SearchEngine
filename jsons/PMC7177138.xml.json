The first confirmed COVID-19 case in India was reported on 30 January 2020. So far, 1,359 cases have been successfully cured and discharged.\u2022\nPandemic Stage: Population, poverty, unplanned cities, illiteracy, and an already overwhelmed health care system are the major hurdles ahead that would be deciding factors as India sail through this COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, most of the regions in India are still in stage 2, with a few locations marked as hotspot due to evidences of \"localized community transmission\u201d suggesting pockets of stage 3 as well. From the experiences of Italy, Spain and United States, we observed that once a country enters stage 3 of COVID-19 pandemic, the health care capacity reaches to its threshold in matter of only few weeks. Even the developed nations with most advanced and resourceful health care infrastructure have crumpled and ran out of critical beds, mechanical ventilators, personal protective equipment's, and other intensive care devices.\nRealizing the grave consequences if not taken COVID-19 pandemic seriously, India is currently trying to be ahead of the curve and efficiently using its health and financial resources.\n\u2022\nInfection rate: Basic reproduction number or R-naught is metric to predict how infectious a disease is? This is a dynamic number and indicates the total average number of persons that will be infected by a confirmed case. In India, R-naught has been found 1.7 as compared to the higher number noted from other countries (China-2.14, Italy-2.34, and Spain-2.74). Experts have expressed their inability to delineate the exact cause for India's low R-naught4. Stringent containment strategies, diligent contact tracing, effective isolation, self-quarantine, and possibly lower COVID-19 testing are few amongst the various circulating theories for this observation.\n",

On 22 March 2020, the Indian government declared one day \u201cVoluntary public curfew\u201d, an innovative initiative requesting everyone to stay at home. However, realizing the increasing numbers every day, on 24th March 2020, the Indian government declared a complete nationwide lockdown for three weeks (Figure 2\n). This was the first ever largest movement restriction ordered by any country so far in the fight against COVID-19. This suppression strategy aims at bringing the reproduction number (R0) <1 and flattening the COVID-19 pandemic curve in order to reduce the burden over health care system. With the help of state agencies and local police, following measures are being implemented in all the states across the country:\u25cbStay at home orders except for emergency situations like groceries, pharmacies and medical aid.\u25cbShutting down of tourist spots, religious places, cinema halls, malls, and the public transport system\u25cbClosure of schools, colleges and universities.\u25cbCancellation of all the regional and nations conferences, sports gatherings, mass gatherings.\u25cbSelf-reporting portal for symptomatic patients.\n",

However, time and again, random reports of unauthorized religious meetings, spreading of rumors, people fleeing the quarantine centers and hiding travel history, organizing unnecessary vacation trips is creating a setback for the government to achieve the desired milestones. There are very basic expectations from Indian nationals at this moment of health crisis: Staying indoors and practicing social distancing, following standard health hygiene guidelines like frequent washing of hands, covering face while coughing, and maintaining self-quarantine if developing dry cough, fever, and fatigue. Also, patients with cancer, pregnant women, and old patients with multiple comorbidities need special care as studies available so far have conveyed that once caught, these patients deteriorate rapidly[7], [8], [9], [10].",
