Bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the right lower lobe revealed 240 WBCs with 81% neutrophils. Sampling of a rapidly progressing pleural effusion showed a pleural fluid pH 6.95, glucose 44 mg/dL and LDH 1842 IU/L. Gram stain of both fluids revealed clusters of Gram positive cocci. Chest tube drainage of the right pleural space was performed. Urinary antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and fungal serologies were negative. He was empirically switched from vancomycin to linezolid. BAL and pleural fluid cultures subsequently grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Serum immunoglobulins (IGs) were found to be very low and he was given intravenous IG. After a prolonged ICU course, he was ultimately transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility and was subsequently discharged to home. He continues to receive intermittent outpatient IVIG.",

Pooled analysis of four prospective CAP studies, of which 138 had delayed-transfer compared to 315 direct Emergency Department (ED) to ICUadmissions, demonstrated that the delayed-transfer group had higher 28-day mortality (23.4% vs. 11.7%, p < 0.02) and hospital length of stay (13 days vs. 7 days, p < 0.001) in propensity-matched analysis [1].",

While optimal thresholds are still a matter of debate, a pH < 7.28, glucose <40 mg/dL and/or LDH level >1000 IU/L suggests CPPE or empyema and the necessity for pleural drainage to achieve a good outcome [16, 17]. In contrast, UPPEs are usually exudates with pleural fluid pH > 7.28 and normal glucose. As UPPEs are reactive, they should resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

Several ICU studies suggest this risk is <5% of patients. Previously, the healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) category was used to identify patients who develop pneumonia outside the hospital yet were at risk forresistant pathogens usually associated with nosocomial pneumonia [19]. HCAP criteria were not originally developed for pneumonia and their use has resulted in significant overtreatment with broad spectrum antibiotics and an associated increased mortality [19, 20]. Conversely, ignoring risk factors is associated with undertreatment and adverse outcomes [7]. In a prospective observational study, Shindo et al. found six independent risk factors for pathogens resistant to the usual CAP antibiotics: (1) hospitalization \u22652 days during the previous 90 days, (2) antibiotic use during the previous 90 days, (3) non-ambulatory status, (4) tube feedings, (5) immunocompromised status, and (6) use of gastric acid suppression medications [20]. MRSA risk factors were slightly different but overlapped. Importantly, two or more risk factors are required before the frequency of MDR pathogens justifies empirical broad-spectrum therapy, resulting in far less use while still identifying the majority who would need broad-spectrum therapy. New CAP guidelines will offer an alternative to the HCAP criteria but these will also need validation.",

Presence of PVL may explain the associated neutropenia while other exotoxins, such as \u03b1-hemolysin, may result in the characteristic severe pulmonary hemorrhage of both the MRSA and MSSA infections. A community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) clone, distinct from that usually causing nosocomial pneumonia, has emerged as a cause of pneumonia with striking necrotizing features [7]. Antibiotic therapy that also suppresses toxin production provides better outcomes and improved survival, as illustrated in a retrospective study of PVL-positive CAP [14]. Clindamycin and linezolid suppress in vitro formation of PVL, \u03b1-hemolysin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, whereas vancomycin and beta-lactams have no effect. The benefit of clindamycin in MSSA isolates resistant by susceptibility testing is unclear, since the correlation of susceptibility with toxin-suppression activity is uncertain. While preferred treatment for PVL-positive MSSA CAP is still unclear, linezolid appears the most reasonable choice forCA-MRSA CAP in light of its potential to suppress exotoxin and greater eradication in other MRSA clones.",
