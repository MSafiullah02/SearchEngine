The number of vapers has risen to 41 million worldwide in 2018 and could reach almost 55 million by 2021. These systems typically contain nicotine, but also flavorings and other chemicals, or even marijuana. They work by heating the e-liquid or e-oil provided in cartridges to produce an aerosol with vapor that is inhaled into the lungs.",

In August 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared an \"outbreak\" of the e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). In this case series, computed tomography (CT scan) of the chest revealed diffuse basilar-predominant infiltrates with opacities and nodular lesions. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology found extensive lipid within alveolar macrophages without evidence for alveolar hemorrhage or eosinophilia. Acute lipoid pneumonia was supposed to be caused by aerosolized oils from e-cigarettes deposited in alveoli, inducing local inflammation that impaired gas exchange.",
