Since its emergence, PRRSV has spread widely throughout most pig-producing countries and continues to cause enormous economic losses in the swine industry due to the complexity of the disease. Despite the similar clinical manifestations and nearly simultaneous emergence, the two viruses from different continents exhibit remarkable genetic heterogeneity with approximately 56% nucleotide identity (Zimmerman et al., 2012) . Now, two viruses have been considered different species; PRRSV-1 (formerly known as European and type 1) and PRRSV-2 (formerly known as North American and type 2) (Adams et al., 2016; Kuhn et al., 2016) . Specifically, PRRSV-1 consists of three subtypes, whereas PRRSV-2 can be classified into nine lineages (Shi et al., 2010a (Shi et al., , 2010b .

Over the past two decades, Korean PRRSV-2 has expanded its genetic diversity through the continuous evolution and emergence of novel strains, which results in the independent evolution of the virus in Korea (Kwon et al., 2018) . Specifically, some of Korean PRRSV-2 strains are phylogenetically related to MN184 strain as well as NADC30 strain, both of which were identified in United States in 2001 and 2008, respectively (Brockmeier et al., 2012; Han et al., 2006) .

The importance of recombination in PRRSV evolution has been highlighted by the emergence of recombinant highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) in China.

The major parental region of KU-N1202 was found to be related to Korean MN184-like strains, but the minor parental region of KU-N1202 was closely related to VR-2332. The beginning (D) and ending (E) of recombination breakpoints were elucidated.

Left and right dashes indicate the stop codon of ORF5 and the start codon of ORF6, respectively. The ending breakpoint (black box) was found to be located in the middle region of ORF7. different continents, PRRS spread has become endemic to most pigproducing countries. The continuous evolution of PRRSV has resulted in the recent emergence of novel highly pathogenic variants of both PRRSV-1 in Eastern Europe (Karniychuk et al., 2010) , PRRSV-2 in North America (Han et al., 2006) and Asia Tong et al., 2007) . Rapid evolution is a feature of PRRSV and results from two evolutionary mechanisms, specifically, high mutation rates and recombination, which lead to an expansion of genetic diversity and a gain of viral fitness (Domingo and Holland, 1997; Hanada et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2010a) . Vast genetic heterogeneity was initially regarded as the accumulation of point mutations based on the high error rate of viral polymerase. However, the recent emergence of various forms of recombinant HP-PRRSV in China led to an emphasis on importance of recombination during PRRSV evolution. In this study, we successfully isolated a natural recombinant virus that was circulating in a commercial pig herd using a stable cell line and evaluated its pathogenicity in pigs. First, we determined the complete genome sequence of KU-N1202 to investigate its genetic and recombination characteristics. Three rounds of plaque purification in a stable cell line excluded the possibility of co-infection of two different PRRSV-2 strains and other contamination. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the virus was closely related to Korean nsp2-deletion isolates, sharing three discontinuous deletions in nsp2 regions (Choi et al., 2014) . KU-N1202 also harbored an additional 1-amino acid deletion at position 559 based on nsp2 of VR-2332. All deletions within nsp2 of KU-N1201 occurred in a region that is not essential for virus viability (Han et al., 2007) . The most distinct feature of KU-N1202 was the chimeric architecture of structural proteins. Major structural proteins were found to be highly similar to those of VR-2332, but minor structural proteins were closely related to those of Korean strains. Many previous studies have highlighted the important role of structural proteins in PRRSV pathogenesis. A heterodimer of GP5 and M interacts with heparin-like receptor and minor structural proteins attach to the CD163 receptor on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) for viral entry (Das et al., 2010; Delputte et al., 2002) . In addition, neutralizing epitopes were found in GP2, GP3, and GP4 of PRRSV-1, and antibodies against these neutralizing epitopes were previously found to effectively reduce the growth of PRRSV in PAMs (Vanhee et al., 2011) . GP5 has been considered a major determinant for immunogenicity and the protective properties of PRRSV, as immunization with GP5 in experimental conditions elicits the production of serum-neutralizing antibodies and further, a linear neutralizing epitope was previously identified (Ostrowski et al., 2002; Pirzadeh and Dea, 1998) . Recent studies showed that key residues of GP5 and M participate in neutralizing activity against swine polyclonal sera (Fan et al., 2015 (Fan et al., , 2016 Trible et al., 2015) . Given the importance of structural proteins in viral pathogenesis, KU-N1202 successfully utilizes structural proteins from different origins for viral attachment. In addition, it is plausible that the virus might display broad immunogenicity against Korean PRRSV-2 as well as VR-2332-like strains. Further study is needed to investigate the effect of the chimeric composition of structural proteins on viral pathogenesis and immunogenicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1080, "end": 1105, "text": "(Karniychuk et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1151, "text": "(Han et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1179, "text": "Tong et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1422, "text": "(Domingo and Holland, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1443, "text": "Hanada et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1462, "text": "Shi et al., 2010a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2397, "text": "(Choi et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2620, "text": "(Han et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3155, "end": 3173, "text": "(Das et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3196, "text": "Delputte et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3401, "end": 3422, "text": "(Vanhee et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3705, "end": 3729, "text": "(Ostrowski et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3730, "end": 3753, "text": "Pirzadeh and Dea, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3893, "text": "(Fan et al., 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3894, "end": 3913, "text": "(Fan et al., , 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3914, "end": 3934, "text": "Trible et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The order Nidovirales consists of two families, Arterviridae and Coronaviridae, and all viruses within this order produce a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs during infection. The current model regarding the production of this set of sgRNAs proposes that RdRp pauses at the body TRS near the 5\u2032 end of each structural ORF and then T. Kwon, et al. Virology 530 (2019) 89-98 jumps to the leader TRS at the 3\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 UTR, guided by the complementarity of the two TRSs (Fehr and Perlman, 2015) . It is generally known that the TRS forms a stem-loop structure to generate a nested set of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 co-terminal sgRNAs. This discontinuous sgRNA transcription strategy resembles a copy-choice mechanism that is a widely accepted mechanism of viral recombination (Kappes and Faaberg, 2015) . For this reason, the discontinuous sgRNA transcription strategy is the most plausible reason for the high frequency of recombination in coronaviruses (van Marle et al., 1999) . However, recombination breakpoints appear to be random throughout the genome of coronaviruses with little evidence of a role for TRS in recombination (Su et al., 2016) . For PRRSV, homologous recombination events were continuously identified, especially in China, and their breakpoints were found to be scattered throughout the PRRSV genome, regardless of any strong tendency for recombination breakpoints. These results implied the occurrence of PRRSV recombination at random breakpoints in the field. However, KU-N1202 had unique recombinant characteristics; specifically, the beginning breakpoint was located at the body TRS of ORF5. This might indicate that the stem-loop structure of TRS acts as a recombination hotspot, at which point RNA-dependent RNA polymerase disjoined and switched the genome of PRRSV. KU-N1202 is a recombinant virus between a Korean field strain and VR-2332-like strain. The major parental strain of the virus was found to be Korean MN184-like strain, which resulted from independent evolution. The fact that the minor parent strain of KU-N1202 shared 99% nucleotide identity to VR-2332 is remarkable because VR-2332 is a parental strain of the commercial MLV that has been widely used in Korean pig herds. Under these circumstances, the possible mechanisms underlying this recombination event in the field are suggested as follows: 1) vaccination using a commercial MLV in a Korean PRRSV-2infected pig or 2) co-infection with Korean PRRSV-2 and a reverted vaccine-like virus. Inappropriate vaccination strategies and the use of genetically distant vaccines might contribute to the emergence of recombinant viruses in the field. Furthermore, most diagnostic laboratories use ORF5 sequencing as a common approach to identify PRRSV strains in Korea. If the sample had been submitted to other laboratories, Fig. 5 .

Kwon, et al. Virology 530 (2019) 89-98 the virus might have been diagnosed as a vaccine-like strain. However, the virus was actually a Korean field strain that recombined with a vaccine-like strain. This point highlights the importance of an advanced method to identify PRRSV strains using broader regions, for example entire structural genes (Kwon et al., 2018) . In this study, mild-to-moderate respiratory clinical signs and an increase in rectal temperature were observed in challenged pigs. A low level of viremia, virus shedding, and viral loads in tissues were also identified in the challenge group. Histopathological findings confirmed the extent of respiratory and lymphoid lesions as mild-to-moderate grade in challenged pigs. Taken together, KU-N1202, a Korean recombinant virus, could be considered a mildly-to-moderately virulent strain, although severe PRRS at a high prevalence was observed in the infected farm. There are various possible explanations for differences in clinical manifestations between experimental and field conditions. One is that PRRSV is one of the most important pathogens responsible for the porcine respiratory disease complex in the field, in which co-infection with other respiratory pathogens exacerbates the severity of clinical signs and pathology in pigs (Opriessnig et al., 2011) . In addition, poor housing conditions and poor management might also contribute to respiratory disease in the field. In contrast, our experiment condition minimized the effect of other factors by using PRRSV-negative pigs with high health status and housing them in research facilities which maintained appropriate temperature, uniform light and good air flow with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter system. Another possibility is that the virus used in this study adapted to MARC-145 during plaque-purification, which might contribute to differences in pathogenicity in pigs. Furthermore, it is interesting that pigs in the contact group were healthy throughout the study, although low viremia, low virus shedding, and low virus distribution in tissues were identified. This implied that the recombinant virus could be transmitted between pigs, possibly via nasal secretions, but displays limited capability to induce clinical manifestations in contact pigs. However, in this study, we could not determine the effect of recombination on pathogenicity and transmissibility in pigs because we were not able to isolate some of Korean strains that shared over 98% nucleotide identities. In animal study, other Korean field strains were not included because the involvement of genetically distant virus, not parental strain, could unintentionally mislead about role of recombination in pathogenicity and transmissibility. In this respect, a reverse genetic system could provide important clues regarding the possible relationship between recombination and pathogenicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3, "end": 41, "text": "Kwon, et al.
