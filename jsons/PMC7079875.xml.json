A significant amount of contemporary investigation is currently pursued on these compounds worldwide. The chemistry of isoxazoles (Fig. 1) has been an interesting field of study for decades because of their prominent potential as analgesic (Karthikeyan et al. 2009), anti-inflammatory (Rajanarendar et al. 2015; Banoglu et al. 2016), anticancer (Kumbhare et al. 2012; Tzanetou et al. 2014), antimicrobial (Siddiqui et al. 2013; Basha et al. 2015), antiviral (Lee et al. 2009), anticonvulsant (Fr\u00f8lund et al. 2007), antidepressant (Yu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2016) and immunosuppressant (Ye et al. 2015). The literature survey revealed that the substitution of various groups on the isoxazole ring imparts different activity.",

DES are an environmentally benign alternative to hazardous (organic) solvents that can be recycled (P\u00e9rez and Ram\u00f3n 2015). Jadhav et al. synthesized highly pure 3,5-disubstituted isoxazoles (Route d, Fig. 2) by converting aldoximes to nitrile oxides in the presence of Hydroxy (tosyloxy) iodobenzene (HTIB) and then reacting them with alkynes.

The cross-coupling reaction of these heterocyclic silanols with a variety of aryl iodides leads to the formation of a variety of 3,4,5-trisubstituted isoxazoles. Gayon et al. (2011) synthesized trisubstituted isoxazoles using an uninterrupted four-step sequence method from readily available propargylic alcohols using sequentially iron and palladium catalyzed systems (Route b, Fig. 3). The overall yields of this method were high, and it emerged as a time-saving procedure.",

Some aminoisoxazole-based derivatives synthesized by Ostacolo et al. (2013) were able to modulate TRPM8 that can be used for cold-evoked analgesia. The ability of the compounds to act as TRPM8 agonists was studied using [Ca2+]-imaging experiments in sensory neurons in vitro, and an in vivo model of cold allodynia. Some of the compounds were up to 200-fold more potent than menthol, but none of them showed improved efficacy. The compound 8 (Fig. 7) was most promising. TRPV1 channels are Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in primary afferent neurons and are the integrator of nociceptive responses to both chemical and noxious stimuli. After the HTS, Palin et al. (2011) synthesized an isoxazole-3-carboxamide series and evaluated them for their ability to modulate TRPV1 channel. Substitution of isoxazole-3-carboxamide with 1S, 3R-3-aminocyclohexanol motif (compounds 9 and 10; Fig. 7) aided both potency and solubility. These compounds were further progressed to animal studies, where both the compounds attenuated the acute inflammatory response in the rat complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant assay.",

            "text": "A series of 4,5-diaryloisoxazol-3-carboxylic acids was synthesized by Banoglu et al. (2016) as leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors targeting FLAP. Leukotrienes have important roles in various inflammatory diseases. In the very first step of leukotriene biosynthesis, there is an involvement of FLAP. Compounds 11a and 11b (Fig. 7) emerged as potent anti-inflammatory agents possessing potent inhibitory activity against cellular 5-Lipoxygenase product synthesis with IC50 of 0.24 \u00b5M each. Silva et al. (2002) synthesized isoxazole derivatives as nAChR ligands for the development of analgesics. nAChR has gained much attention due to beneficial effects of nicotine in CNS disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and pain reflexes. Compound 12 (Fig. 7) displayed the best analgesic profile in the series. Peifer et al. (2009) synthesized 3,4-diaryl isoxazoles as a dual inhibitor of p38\u03b1 MAP kinase and CK1\u03b4. Compounds 13 and 14 (Fig. 7) were found to be highly potent dual inhibitors of p38\u03b1 and CK1\u03b4. p38\u03b1 MAP kinase plays a major role in signal transduction of severe inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and autoimmune disorders (Peifer et al. 2006). Laufer et al. (2006) synthesized 3,4 and 4,5-disubstituted and 3,4,5-trisubstituted isoxazoles which were tested in an in vitro ELISA of isolated p38 MAP kinase and for inhibitory potency against cytP450 to develop agents for the treatment of rheumatoid and inflammatory diseases. The pyridinyl isoxazole (15; Fig. 7) displayed significant suppression of cytokine release, low affinity towards cytP450 and potent inhibitory activity towards isolated p38 MAP kinase.",

Compound 19 (Fig. 8) also displayed acceptable aqueous solubility, desirable pharmacokinetic properties and high cytotoxic selectivity against MV4-11 cells. SAR studies revealed that an electron-rich fused ring (R) at the phenyl was beneficial for the antiproliferative activity. Im et al.

Most of the compounds displayed selective antiproliferative activity toward the U937 cell line, and the activities were better than the reference drug Sorafenib while weak cytotoxic activities against human normal cell line and A375P.

(2014) synthesized a series of small molecules with 4,5-diarylisoxazole scaffold and evaluated them for Hsp90 inhibitory activity. In this series, compound 28 (Fig. 8) showed high affinity for Hsp90 and strongly inhibited it at both molecular and cellular level. Further in vivo studies showed that compound 28 (Fig. 8) strongly suppresses the tumor growth of human glioblastoma xenograft model U-87MG and displayed good results in pharmacokinetic and safety experiments. Another series of 4,5-diaryl isoxazoles was synthesized by Zhang et al. (2017) by incorporating diversified amino acid derivatives with various lengths to the 3-amido motif. These compounds were evaluated for Hsp90 inhibitory activity and antiproliferative activity against H3122 human lung cancer and BT-474 breast cancer cells. Compound 29 (Fig. 8) bearing a terminal valine methyl ester and an ethylene glycol-containing linear linker displayed high Hsp90 binding potency (14 nM), as well as antiproliferative activity against the tested cell lines. Bargiotti et al. (2012) synthesized isoxazolo(aza)naphthoquinones and evaluated them for cytotoxic Hsp90 inhibitory activity in a series of human tumor cell lines. Most of the compounds mainly 3-pyridyl derivatives (30; Fig. 9) displayed high affinity and potent antiproliferative activity.",

All the compounds showed moderate insecticidal activity, out of which compounds 100a and 100b (Fig. 19) showed comparatively higher activities. SAR studies revealed that a combination of both aliphatic and aromatic amide moieties could improve the insecticidal activity. Yu et al. (2009) prepared a series of 3-(arylthiomethyl)isoxazole-4,5-carboxamides (101; Fig. 19) and evaluated for insecticidal activity using high-throughput screening (HTS) against Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) and A. aegypti (yellow fever mosquito). The results confirmed that 3,4,5-trisubstituted isoxazoles present a bioactive scaffold that can be utilized to design novel insecticides. To identify potential selective and resistance-breaking mosquitocides against the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, Verma et al. (2015) investigated the AChE inhibitory and mosquitocidal properties of isoxazol-3-yl dimethylcarbamates (102; Fig. 19), and the corresponding 3-oxoisoxazole-2(3H)-dimethylcarboxamide isomers (103; Fig. 19). In both series, compounds were found with excellent contact toxicity to wild-type susceptible (G3) strain and multiply resistant (Akron) strain mosquitoes that carry the G119S resistance mutation of AChE.",

Some of the synthesized compounds 109 (Fig. 21) showed promising antihyperglycemic activity with moderate lipid-lowering activity. These compounds did not show any significant activity in PPAR and DPP-4 assay but exhibited the promising PTP1B inhibitory activity which revealed their mode of action. Jadhav et al.
