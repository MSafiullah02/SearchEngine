As of May 16, 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, causative pathogen for COVID-19) has been detected in every country, with more than 4.6 million confirmed cases and a death toll exceeding 300,000 worldwide [2]. Furthermore, recent pandemic model projections estimate that COVID-19 could result in ~ 40 million deaths globally this year, if no interventions are implemented [3]. To date, in the absence of efficacious pharmaceutical measures for prevention or treatment, the principal strategy to control COVID-19 has focused on community-based, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [4]. These NPIs typically include a package of mitigation and suppression measures (e.g., case-based isolation, shielding of vulnerable groups, school closures, restricting public events and lockdowns), that aim to minimize person-to-person transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 through social distancing [5].",

There is a growing concern whether these prolonged interventions are sustainable given the widespread disparities in economic resilience and health sector capacities globally [9]. As a result, many countries worldwide are currently considering to lift the lockdowns\u2014increasing the likelihood of disease resurgence. In this regard, dynamic NPIs with intervals of relaxed social distancing, may serve as a realistic alternative to achieve the NPI goals, with minimal adverse socioeconomic consequences. However, it remains unclear (1) what should be the frequency and duration of such dynamic NPIs, (2) what should be the ideal \u201cbreak\u201d when interventions can be relaxed temporarily before case numbers resurge, and (3) which dynamic NPI strategy should be adapted globally across regions with diverse health and economic infrastructures. Addressing these issues is essential to devise feasible, context-specific policies to prevent collapse of healthcare systems, reduce premature deaths and minimize detrimental impacts on national economies associated with prolonged continuous NPIs.",

Since the distributions of age and underlying co-morbidities may differ importantly by country, region and economic status [4] we have hypothesised that the predicted mortality impacts for NPI strategies will differ importantly. Therefore, for this current study, we have considered several circumstances. First, we used age-standardized clinical dynamic estimates to model the epidemic trajectories in 16 different countries (which comprise roughly a quarter of the global population), by accessing available country-specific age structure data. Second, we selected these countries from diverse geographical regions: Western Europe (The Netherlands, Belgium), South America (Chile, Colombia), North America (Mexico), Africa (South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda), South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan Sri Lanka), West Asia (Yemen), and the Pacific (Australia). Third, these countries also represent all income categories equally, as defined by the World Bank [12]: four countries in every high (HIC), higher-middle (HMIC), lower-middle (LMIC) and low income (LIC) groups, respectively.",

We defined the study interventions scenarios based on reduction of the reproduction number during the duration of intervention (R). For this, we assumed a basic reproduction number [13] (R0, the average number of secondary infections arising from a typical single infection in a completely susceptible population) of 2.2 for uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, and effective reproduction numbers (R, average number of secondary cases per infectious case in presence of control measures and a partially immune population) of 0.8 and 0.5 for mitigation and suppression interventions, respectively. These assumptions were based on recent work by Jarvis et al. [14] who reported a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant for physical distancing measures. This corresponded to a pre-intervention R0 value of 2.6 to reduce to a post-intervention R value of 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.37\u20130.89) following strict suppression measures. Even though the exact relationship between changes in the number of social contacts and R0 remains unclear, we used these findings as the rationale to calculate our study\u2019s effective R values of 0.5 and 0.8 for the interventions. These numbers are in agreement with recent estimates for several European countries and arguably reflect the expected effects of a somewhat relaxed and more stringent lockdown [15].",

The duration of breaks between interventions needs to be less than the intervention period for the interventions to be effective; therefore, we set the break duration to be 30 days. When to intervene was determined by the initial fraction of the population that was infected. For example, if the fraction was on the order of 1 part in 10,000 (or more), we set the initiation point for the intervention at Day 20. However, if the fraction was on the order of 1 part in 100,000 to 1 million, we set the initiation point as Day 30. Similarly, if the fraction was on the order of 1 part in 10 million, we set this at Day 50.

Severely infected individuals P enter the hospital as H, after which they either leave the hospital at a rate \u03ba or enter the ICU with probability fU. Age-stratified proportions of hospitalized cases requiring ICU care (fU) were based on the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team\u2019s Report [4], and then standardized according to each country\u2019s population age structure. The quantity 1/\u03ba is the duration of non-ICU hospital stays, which we considered 8 days [4]. Patients U stay in ICU for 1/\u03b4 = 8 days [4], after which a fraction of them die (fD). The age-specific infectious fatality rate (IFR) were obtained from Verity et al. [18]. Those were subsequently applied to individual country\u2019s population to get country-specific age-standardized IFRs (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S16). IFR is the product of fP, fU, and fD. The basic reproduction number is R0 = \u03b2N/\u03b3 = 2\u00b72 [17, 19, 20], with N being the total population size of the country. The set of coupled ordinary differential equations that underpin our model are presented in the Box 1. These equations in the SEIR model were solved numerically using the solve_ivp package in the Python programming language suite [21]; plots were created using the matplotlib graphics package [22].",

In this NPI scenario, the duration of pandemic appeared approximately 12 months in the HIC, and was close to 18 months in the other settings. Additionally, dynamic mitigation interventions were effective at the first 3 months for all the countries, but after the first relaxation, the pandemic would exceed the hospital capacity in all the countries and would result in 3,534,793 deaths. By contrast, we found that dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation, aimed at reducing the effective R to 0.5, were suitable for all settings to keep ICU demand within national capacity (Fig. 1). Since more individuals remain susceptible at the end of each cycle of suppression and relaxation, such approach would result in a longer pandemic, beyond 18 months in all countries; however, global mortality would drop to 131,643 during that period (Fig. 1).",

Our study has several inter-related findings. First, we show that simultaneous cycles of 50-day mitigation (R value of 0.8) followed by a 30-day relaxation could provide means to reduce the effective reproduction number, however, will be insufficient to keep the number of patients requiring ICU care within manageable levels. Second, by contrast, we found that dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression (R value of 0.5) followed by a 30-day relaxation would be required, for all countries, to keep ICU demands below the national capacities. Third, significant number of new infections and deaths could be prevented if these \u201crolling\u201d suppression measures can be maintained for an 18-month period, or until a suitable treatment and/or vaccination become available. Finally, a continuous, yearlong suppression strategy may also reduce overall attack rates significantly and appears effective. However, implementation (and socioeconomic sustenance) of such stringent measure could be challenged by its detrimental impacts on population well-being and livelihood.",

First, despite higher rates of contact across older age groups [3], we predict a somewhat lower incidence of ICU hospitalisation and deaths in low-income settings. This can be explained, at least partly, by the demographic differences with a relatively younger average age structure of these populations, and absence of integrated death registration system. However, given the significant inequalities in baseline health, testing capabilities and critical care infrastructure across the countries, in reality, a higher overall level of excess deaths are likely in resource-poor settings owing to health systems failure, especially in uncontrolled or mitigation intervention scenarios. Second, it was unsurprising that a more restrictive suppression strategy (R: 0.5) in our study reduced ICU hospitalisations and deaths for all countries. This is because a further reduction in the reproductive number secondary to more stringent interventions can maximally reduce the population transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 [24]. Notably, implementation of such strategies also creates a policy dilemma for many low-income countries: how to address the \u201ccompeting priorities\u201d of preventing COVID-19 associated deaths and public health system failure with the long-term economic collapse and hardship. In this regard, we have observed that in contrast to a long fixed-duration social distancing, dynamic NPIs (that reduce the overall attack rates effectively) may offer a helpful balance.",

Notably, this intermittent combination of strict social distancing, and a relatively relaxed period (with efficient testing, case isolation, contact-tracing and shielding of the vulnerable), may allow populations and the national economies to \u201cbreathe\u201d at intervals\u2014a potential that might make this solution more sustainable, especially in resource-poor regions [25]. The specific durations of these interventions can be defined by specific countries according to their needs and local facilities, what is key is to identify a combination pattern that allows to protect the health of the population not only from COVID-19 but also from economic hardship and mental health issues. Finally, these findings reinforce the value of dynamic social distancing strategies estimated by earlier studies for the UK, Canada and China [3, 25, 26], and extend these to multiple global regions under various dynamic intervention scenarios.",

First, as restrictive NPIs may need to be maintained worldwide for many months, we have examined the impacts of dynamic NPIs to \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d at regular intervals. These measures have shown to be largely unaffected to uncertainties in effective R estimates and in the severity of the virus [4]. Second, NPI strategies only blunt (however prolong) the epidemic cycle, since there is lesser build-up of herd immunity while these interventions are kept in place. If these measures are, however, lifted altogether, a second (potentially more serious) outbreak could occur [27]. Therefore, in the absence of individual-level data and more detailed country-specific parameters, our study provides an illustrative comparison of different \u201crolling\u201d strategies to suggest (a) when such measures could be lifted, and (b) for how long. Third, we used the most up-to-date disease transmission parameters [4, 17, 18, 20] to construct our adaptive models, based on well-established SEIR model of epidemic dynamics for infectious diseases. Fourth, since different interventions are likely to be implemented differentially and may have a heterogeneous effect in multiple locations, we have chosen a broad illustrative target of reducing the reproduction number R rather than specific community measures that may differ significantly by context. Fifth, we employed age-standardized estimates of hospitalization and infection-fatality-ratios in countries with diverse demographic structures, and considered countries at various categories of national income, in order to provide useful \u201ccontext-specific\u201d estimates. Finally, we used rise-and-fall timescale of infections (50 days, in the absence of intervention) as the ideal intervention duration and calculated 30-day as the optimal break duration before triggering the next cycle, however specific to each country other combinations could be considered depending the specific settings and availability of resources. In this regard, triggering dynamic interventions based on a specific pre-specified mortality number or rate, as was done in earlier modelling for the UK [3], would not be optimal for under-developed countries since (a) the health systems are less efficient to ascertain all new cases comprehensively, and (b) a younger demographic would mean that by the time the target mortality threshold is reached for the trigger, the countries have already accrued a significantly large number of cases.",

In the absence of country-specific, real-time, reproduction numbers for the epidemic, we assumed a constant transmission rate during each modeled cycle. These estimates are likely to vary by a population\u2019s adherence to the NPI and the mix of specific measures put in place. In this respect, our chosen effective R estimates of 0.8 and 0.5 reflect two scenarios of weaker and stronger reduction in transmission, respectively, which could be achieved through social distancing measures and the interruption of transmission chains (e.g., through ramping up testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine and other potential strategies chosen by individual countries). We anticipate that the countries will be able to introduce additional control measures with time that might counterbalance the detrimental effect of decreasing compliance. The age-standardisation analyses were based on public sector surveillance data, which may not be robust for all LMIC and LIC countries, with potentials for underestimation of cases and deaths. Furthermore, given unavailability of relevant data, we were unable to adjust for wider social and economic costs of the dynamic approaches; further studies will be needed to quantify these aspects. Additional factors such as potential seasonal variations, environmental pollutions or structural determinants may influence, at least in part, these interventions, highlighting the need of flexibility in terms of the suitable strategy and combination of interventions that can be implemented in each country. Finally, similar to all modelling studies, our analyses were based on several transmission parameter assumptions. Since some uncertainties exist around the natural history and local transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2, the precise efficacy and optimal duration of the dynamic strategies may differ for other countries and will need to be tailored accordingly.",

We provide an actionable strategy option for COVID-19 control by employing dynamic interventions that could delay the epidemic peak, while allowing time to enhance health systems capacities and efforts to develop therapies or vaccines. These dynamic measures also allow interim periods of relaxation in order to minimise socioeconomic disruptions and maximise population compliance to these stringent suppression measures. However, these should be weighed carefully against costs, any risks imposed to the society, and the social protection available in each setting. Second, these findings also stimulate further relevant research that may involve: (a) more in-depth analyses of detailed natural history of the disease (e.g., including transmissibility in asymptomatic state) based on patient-level data, when available, from various countries [28], (b) various spatial pathways and patterns of epidemic in different circumstances (e.g., co-morbidity, reinfection) and settings (e.g., urban vs. rural); and (c) targeted modelling studies accounting for genomic susceptibility [29], social behaviour [30] and economic diversity [3].",
