            "text": "Nowadays, incineration has been proved to be the best option for medical waste (MW) treatment as it could reduce the MW volume up to 90% and degrade the infectious materials effectively [1]. In China, especially during SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), numerous MW incineration plants were built to treat the highly infectious MW. Thus large amount of MW ash was generated. Recent reports have shown that this special type of ash is quite different from ashes such as municipal solid waste ash since it is enriched by toxic chemicals such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [2], [3]. This special type of ash may cause secondary pollution to the environment if not properly treated. Currently, there are four major ways to treat the fly ash, i.e. melting treatment, chemical stabilization, cement solidification, and extraction, among which solidification is widely used because of its relatively low cost and easy operation, but there are several disadvantages in this method such as slow leaching of heavy metals from the treated ash and less effect on organic pollutants, which make it still be hazardous in the environment [4]. Therefore, detoxification of this type of fly ash is still a challenge to researchers.",

Recent reports showed that supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SCCDE) was highly effective for metal extraction from coal and organic contaminants from soil and sediment [5], [6]. Furthermore, for MW fly ash, supercritical carbon could extract heavy metals effectively with different entrainers and more than 90% of Cu, Pb and Zn could be extracted from fly ash by cyanex 302 [7]. Although SCCDE has been proved to be a promising method for heavy metal extraction, the incapacity of organic contaminant degradation and expensive entrainer such as Cyanex302, EDTA and NTA greatly restricted the application of these techniques.",

This technology has been proved to be environmentally friendly because no organic solvents or additives are needed during the oxidation and even highly stable aromatic compounds such as PAHs and dioxin can be degraded effectively [8], [9]. Thus far, SCWO technique has been successfully applied to many kinds of wastewater and sludge treatments [10], [11]. Also, some reports showed that stable and hazardous aromatic compounds which formed and absorbed on the ash particle during the combustion process could be decomposed effectively by SCWO [12]. In addition, inorganic materials such as metal salts are insoluble due to the high polarity of ions, hence the circumstance of SCWO could force these metal ions move into more stable speciation which could reduce the mobility of the metals. However, most of the previous studies focused on the organic pollutants treatment using SCWO technique, while little information is available on the application of SCWO to the treatment of hazardous metals.",

Briefly, heavy metals in F1 and F2 fractions firstly dissolved into the water during the hydrothermal process, when the temperature and pressure reach the critical point (647 K, 22.1 MPa), metal ions tended to precipitate. In addition, with organic compounds dissolving into SCW, metals which bound to organic compounds were released and precipitated.

These two metals tend to combine with organic matters again during the cooling process, hence they were mainly found in F4 fraction. Comparing Table 2, Table 3, it was found that Cd and Zn performed different trends between FAR and FAP after SCW treatment, i.e. Cd could not be detected in any fractions in FAR, but 57.1 mg/kg of Cd existed in FAP and 100% of which was in F3 fraction. This could attribute to the different pHs of the solutions during SCW treatment. The acidic solution formed by acidic gas from FAR was sufficient to leach Cd into the solution, while quite amount of Cd was stable in F3 fraction in FAP at near neutral pH. Similarly, the speciation of Zn was also strongly affected by pH after SCW treatment. The result showed that the amount of F3 and F5 fractions in FAP is 78.39% and 15.98%, compared to 30.5% and 57.55% in FAR, respectively. This indicated that Zn in F3 fraction was not stable and tends to transform into F5 fraction at low pH after SCW treatment.",

            "text": "However, organic compounds could not be decomposed completely without additional oxidant because of the low oxidation effect of SCW. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added to enhance the oxidation effect of SCW. From Table 2, Table 3, it can be found that the amount of metals in F4 fraction decreased drastically whereas metals in F3 and F5 fractions increased after SCWH treatment. SEM images show that ash particle changed to porous structure (Fig. 2b and d) after SCWH treatment, demonstrating the intense oxidation effect of SCWH on organic compounds coated on ash particles [19]. Therefore, unlike SCW condition, heavy metals released from F1 and F2 fractions could not bind to organic matters under SCWH condition, e.g., 64.7\u201389.1% of Cu and 28.7\u201368% of Pb were found in F4 fraction in SCW treated ashes, but only 13\u201319% of Cu and 20\u201333% of Pb were in related fraction in SCWH treated ashes. Moreover, it is observed that Cd could not be detected in SCWH treated ashes, indicating that Cd released out from the ash particle into the solution under SCWH condition. It is interesting to notice that, unlike SCW treatment, after SCWH treatment, metals in F3 fraction either increased or remained unchanged, e.g., large amount of Cr remained in F3 fraction with percentages of 41% and 34% in FAR and FAP, respectively. Under SCWH condition, Fe\u2013Mn oxides could be formed and heavy metals could be co-precipitated with Fe\u2013Mn oxides or be oxidized to oxides. It has been reported that Fe\u2013Mn oxides were thermodynamically stable under oxidation environment [15]. Therefore, it can be concluded that heavy metals originally in other fractions could be stabilized in this fraction under SCWH condition.",

On the other hand, the speciation of Ba, Cr and Pb, which mainly existed in F4 and F5 fractions after SCW treatment, were less affected by the treatment time. It is well known that Fe oxide was not stable under acidic environment. Therefore, the acidic solution formed during SCW treatment could leach some metals out from F3 fraction. Consequently, more and more metals were found to be stabilized in F4 and F5 fractions along with the time.",

This could be attributed to the special oxidation property of SCWH, i.e. H2O2 was the major oxidant within 1 h, thus metals could be easily stabilized in F3 fraction.

It can be seen from Table 5\nthat the percentage of As in F5 fraction decreased in both FAR and FAP after 1 h treatment, indicating that both treatments could leach As out from F5 fraction. However, the transformation trends of the leached As was different between FAR and FAP. For FAR, As tended to transform to other four fractions, while for FAP, only the amounts of F3 and F4 fractions of As increased. It has been reported that As mainly exist as H2AsO4\n\u2212 at pH 2\u20137, which could be removed by forming Ca(H2AsO4)2\u00b7nH2O or absorbing on iron (hydr)oxide from solution [20]. Accordingly, it is supposed that the leached As in FAP in the form of H2AsO4\n\u2212 was absorbed on Fe oxide and organic matters, which contributed to the increase of As fractions in F3 and F4. Meanwhile, in FAR, the acidic solution could destroy Fe oxide, causing As, in the form of H2AsO4\n\u2212, either reacted with Ca2+ to form calcium arsenates or be absorbed on ash particles. This process could contribute to the increase of As in F2 and F1 fractions. Therefore, it is necessary to neutralize the acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to SCW treatment. Furthermore, it can also be seen from Table 5 that the distribution of As speciation after 1 h SCWH treatment was similar to 4 h SCW treatment, and exhibited a minor change along with time. This indicates that the oxidation function could significantly accelerate the process of As transformation, and the distribution of As speciation could reach balance among the five fractions within 1 h under SCWH condition.",

Sequential extraction suggested that SCW could effectively transform Ba, Cr, Cu and Pb into F4 and F5 fractions, while SCWH made these metals mainly bound to F5 fraction. More heavy metals especially Cd and Zn could be leached out or transformed to F5 fraction at lower pH since the acidic solution could destroy Fe\u2013Mn oxide under SCW condition. On the other hand, As could be extracted from F5 fraction after SCW and SCWH treatments, and tended to absorb onto Fe oxide and organic matters under near neutral condition.
