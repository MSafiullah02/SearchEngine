Cough begins with stimulation of cough receptors, located in the upper and lower airways, and in many other sites such as the ear canal, tympanic membrane, sinuses, nose, pericardium, pleura, and diaphragm. Receptors send messages via vagal, phrenic, glossopharyngeal, or trigeminal nerves to the \u201ccough center,\u201d which is in the medulla. Because cough is not only an involuntary reflex activity but also one that can be initiated or suppressed voluntarily, \u201chigher centers\u201d must also be involved in the afferent limb of the responsible pathway. The neural impulses go from the medulla to the appropriate efferent pathways to the larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and expiratory muscles.",

These pressures may be transmitted to vascular, cerebrospinal, and intraocular spaces. Finally, the glottis opens, allowing for explosive expiratory airflow (300 m/sec) and expulsion of mucus, particularly from the larger, central airways. The inability to seal the upper airway (tracheostomy) impairs, but does not abolish, the effectiveness of cough. Weak ventilatory muscles (muscular dystrophy) impair both the inspiratory and the compressive phase.",

Fluid in larger airways causes crackles early in inspiration (congestive heart failure). Crackles that tend to be a bit lower in pitch (\u201ccoarse\u201d crackles) than the early, higher-pitched (\u201cfine\u201d) crackles are associated with fluid in small airways (pneumonia). Although crackles usually signal the presence of excess airway fluid (pneumonia, pulmonary edema), they may also be produced by the popping open of noninfected fibrotic or atelectatic airways. Fine crackles are not audible at the mouth, whereas coarse crackles may be. Crackles is the preferred term, rather than the previously popular \u201crales.\u201d\u2022\nRhonchi, or \u201clarge airway sounds,\u201d are continuous gurgling or bubbling sounds typically heard during both inhalation and exhalation. These sounds are caused by movement of fluid and secretions in larger airways (asthma, viral URI). Rhonchi, unlike other sounds, may clear with coughing.\u2022\nWheezes are continuous musical sounds (lasting longer than 200 msec), caused by vibration of narrowed airway walls, as with asthma, and perhaps vibration of material within airway lumens.

Table 2.7\nhighlights some of the radiographic features of the most common causes of cough in pediatric patients. Radiographic findings are often similar for a number of disorders, and thus these studies may not indicate a definitive diagnosis. Chest radiographs are normal in children with psychogenic (habit) cough and in children with sinusitis or gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as the primary cause of cough. A normal chest radiograph indicates the unlikelihood of pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, Chlamydia species, or bacteria. Although children with cough resulting from cystic fibrosis (CF), Mycoplasma species, tuberculosis, aspiration, a bronchial foreign body, or an anatomic abnormality usually have abnormal chest radiographs, a normal radiograph does not exclude these diagnoses. Hyperinflation of the lungs is commonly seen on chest radiographs of infants with RSV bronchiolitis or Chlamydia pneumonia, and a lobar or round (coin lesion) infiltrate is the radiographic hallmark of bacterial pneumonia. The diagnosis of sinusitis cannot be sustained with normal sinuses on radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan.",

            "text": "CF is a genetic disorder, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The CF gene is on the long arm of chromosome 7; more than 1900 mutations have been identified at the CF locus. Of these mutations, one (\u0394F508, indicating a deletion, \u0394, of a single phenylalanine, F, at position 508 of the protein product) is the most common, responsible for 70-75% of all CF chromosomes. The mutation affects the gene's protein product, termed cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), which acts as a chloride channel and affects other aspects of membrane transport of ions and water. Not all the consequences of the defective gene and protein have been determined. In general, however, the defective gene product results in the long-observed clinical manifestations of the disease, including thick, viscid mucus in the tracheobronchial tree, leading to purulent bronchiolitis and bronchitis with subsequent bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure; pancreatic duct obstruction, leading to pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea and failure to thrive; and abnormally high sweat chloride and sodium concentrations. The airway disease in CF is characterized by infection, inflammation, and endobronchial obstruction. The infection begins with S. aureus, H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or combinations of these organisms but eventually is dominated by nonmucoid or mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other organisms, such as Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, Aspergillus fumigatus, or nontuberculous mycobacteria may also appear; their significance remains undetermined. In some patients, B. cepacia has been associated with rapid deterioration and death, and in others, Aspergillus species has caused allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The airway inflammation in all patients with CF appears to be the result of toxic substances, including elastase, released by neutrophils as they respond to the endobronchial infection and by similar enzymes released by the invading organisms.",

The most common presenting symptom is cough, which may appear within the first weeks of life or may be delayed for decades. The cough can be dry, productive, or paroxysmal. Cough may respond to antibiotics or perhaps steroids, but it is less likely to improve with bronchodilators (see Tables 2.3 and 2.5). Although CF is a genetic disease, there is often no family history. Furthermore, in atypical cases, patients may not have pancreatic insufficiency (~10% of patients) and thus may not demonstrate steatorrhea and failure to thrive.

The proper technique is to use quantitative analysis of the concentration of chloride in the sweat produced after pilocarpine iontophoretic stimulation. Chloride concentrations higher than 60 mmol/L are considered positive, and those lower than 40 mmol/L are negative (normal). Healthy adults have slightly higher sweat chloride concentrations than do children, but the same guidelines hold for positive tests in adults.

The main drawback of the IRT assay is that it has relatively poor specificity; as many as 90% of the positive results on the initial screen are false-positive results. If an infant's IRT screen is positive, the test should be repeated, or DNA analysis for the 23 most common CFTR mutations should be performed.

Diagnosis may, on occasion, be made with plain-chest radiographs, but high-resolution CT scanning is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Treatment of bronchiectasis consists of airway clearance with chest physiotherapy with postural drainage or high-frequency chest wall oscillation, occasionally bronchodilators and mucolytic agents, and antibiotic therapy during exacerbations. Surgical resection may be indicated in cases that are progressive and localized when medical therapy has failed. The prognosis of bronchiectasis depends on the underlying cause.

The ratio of the distal phalangeal depth (DPD) to the interphalangeal depth (IPD), or the phalangeal depth ratio, is normally less than 1 but increases to more than 1 with finger clubbing. The DPD/IPD ratio can be measured with calipers or, more accurately, with finger casts. The hyponychial angle is measured from lateral projections of the finger contour on a magnifying screen and is normally less than 180 degrees but greater than 195 degrees with finger clubbing. Schamroth sign is useful for bedside assessment. The dorsal surfaces of the terminal phalanges of similar fingers are placed together. With clubbing, the normal diamond-shaped aperture or \u201cwindow\u201d at the bases of the nail beds disappears, and a prominent distal angle forms between the end of the nails.

The expiratory component is louder and longer than the inspiratory component; a definite pause is heard between the two phases. Bronchovesicular breath sounds are a mixture of bronchial and vesicular sounds. The inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) components are equal in length. They are usually heard only in the first and second interspaces anteriorly and between the scapulae posteriorly, near the carina and mainstem bronchi.
