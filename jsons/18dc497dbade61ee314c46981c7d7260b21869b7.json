In this experiment, the selected downstream primer was labeled with biotin and the 5' end of RAA probe was labeled with FAM by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD). A RT-RAA-LFD assay that could be used for detection of IBV was established after optimization of RT-RAA reaction time, reaction temperature, and primer concentration. This method did not need reverse transcription of IBV template under isothermal condition (37\u00b0C), the amplification of target gene frag-ments could be completed within only 24 min, and the amplification products could be visually observed and determined by LFD within 3 min. The specificity test demonstrated that there was no cross reaction with the nucleic acids of other similar common pathogens. The lowest detectable limit for IBV was 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, and this method was 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (10 4 copies/\u03bcL), as verified by sensitivity test. The results showed that RT-RAA-LFD assay with strong specificity and high sensitivity was simple and easy to operate, and could be used for rapid detection of IBV in clinical diagnosis.",

Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (Cheng et al., 2018; Haji-Abdolvahab et al., 2019) . Infectious bronchitis virus genome is unstable and prone to point mutation, deletion, insertion, etc., which leads to continuous isolation of gene mutants. In addition, there are many serotypes of IBV, and the cross-protection between different serotypes or genotypes is very weak (Leghari et al., 2016) , which makes the immune control of this disease constantly challenged (Faruku et al., 2015) . Therefore, although the disease has been reported for more than 60 yr, its prevention and control is still not good (Cook et al., 2012) . The incidence of IBV is high, broilers infected with this virus will grow slowly and feed conversion ratio (FCR) will decline, and if laying hens are infected with IBV, it can lead to the decline of egg production and egg quality, so IB is one of the main infectious diseases detrimental to China's poultry industry.",

The respiratory signs include coughing, sneezing, gasping, and tracheal rales, and there may be gray feces for some diseased chickens (Wu et al., 1998) . Necropsy showed catarrhal and hemorrhagic inflammatory lesions of the trachea. Chickens of all ages can be infected with IBV, which is mainly found in respiratory epithelial cells, digestive tract, and other tissues such as kidney, fallopian tube, and testes (Cavanagh, 2007) . With clinical symptoms and pathological features similar to those of Newcastle disease (ND), avian influenza (AI), and infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), IB is easy to be misdiagnosed (Giovanni et al., 2017) . The current methods for detection of IBV are conventional virus isolation (CVI), reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction-agarose gel electrophoresis (RT-PCR-AGE), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). However, these methods often require expensive devices and professional operators, making it very 1 IBV-1-F  TCCGTTGGGATTTTATTCCTCTGAATCGTG  468 to 498  IBV-1-R  TACTGGTCTGGTATAGCACATGGTTGGGTC  683 to 703  IBV-2-F  AGTATCTGGCATCGCCTCATTTCTTTCTAACC  238 to 270  IBV-2-R  CCTACCACGATTCAGAGGAATAAAATCCCAACG  502 to 535  IBV-3-F  GCCGATTTTGTAAACGTACCATTCCACCAG  684 to 711  IBV-3-R  AACACGCCCATCCTTAATACCTTCCTCATT  814 to 844  IBV-4-F  CGTCTTATAACTGGTAGATTGTCATCACTC  989 to 1019  IBV-4-R  ATTACCACAAAAGGAGTACCTAGTAGACTG  1142 to 1172 inconvenient for veterinarians at the grass roots level in many regions. Reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA), following the principle of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), is employed for simulating the enzymatic process of DNA replication in vivo, and amplifying the DNA template. Using this technique, the reverse transcription of RNA and DNA amplification can be completed in a short time at a constant temperature of about 37 to 39\u00b0C. At the same time, the probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and primers were labeled with biotin in the experiment to form double-labeled amplification product that could be visually observed and determined by lateral flow dipstick (LFD) with FAM antibody test line and biotin antibody control line. This method with high specificity and sensitivity was easy and convenient to use, and thus had broad application prospects in clinical diagnosis (Kim and Easley, 2011) .",

Conventional virus isolation (CVI) is the most classical and reliable method for the diagnosis of IB, but it has the disadvantages of long period and high technical requirements. Serological diagnosis is also a common technique in the actual detection of IB, but most of the commercial IBV antibody kits are coated with whole virions, having a strong cross-reaction with local strains of different serotypes, as a result, the application of commercial IBV antibody detection kit is limited (Lin et al., 1991) . Conventional PCR and RFQ-PCR are sensitive and specific in nucleic acid diagnosis, but they still have the shortcomings of long period, carcinogen EB pollution and need for expensive instruments . Reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification is a rapid, specific, sensitive, and reliable technique for isothermal gene amplification (Daher et al., 2016) .
