Consequently, in June 1976, shortly after the Asilomar Conference (see Chapter 9: Ensuring Safety in Biotechnology), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) brought out the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant Nucleic Acid Molecules (henceforth referred to as \"NIH Guidelines\"). (The guidelines have undergone several revisions, the most recent one being in April 2016.) The guidelines recognize six classes of experiments based on the risk involved in the research, which require sanction from different regulatory bodies (see Chapter 9: Ensuring Safety in Biotechnology, Box 9.2).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Recognizing that biological safety is an important international issue, the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) in 1983 published the Laboratory Biosafety Manual (henceforth referred to as \"WHO manual\") establishing basic concepts and practices in safe handling of pathogenic microorganisms. The document encouraged countries to develop national codes of practice for implementation within their geographic boundaries. The WHO manual has since been revised twice, in 1993 and again in 2004.

Exporting countries need to demonstrate that the measures it applies to its exports achieve the same level of health protection as in the importing countries in order to avoid barriers in trade. Providing oversight to global rules of trade between nations is the mandate of the World Trade Organization. This organization administers the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (see Chapter 13: Relevance of Intellectual Property Rights in Biotechnology). Article 20 of the GATT allows governments to regulate trade to address biosafety of their citizens provided they do not discriminate or use this clause to disguise protectionism. Countries therefore have made efforts to develop guidelines and appropriate legal frameworks for biosafety regulation. Although the developed countries (e.g., the United States) and regions (e.g., European Union) as leaders in the development of modern biotechnology started to develop these frameworks in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the developing nations generally started the development of national biosafety systems more recently.

The primary purpose of GLP is to ensure uniformity, consistency, and reliability of safety tests (nonclinical) for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, aroma and color food/feed additives, cosmetics, detergents, novel foods, nutritional supplements for livestock, and other chemicals. These safety tests are used to generate data on various parameters from physicochemical properties to toxicity (nonclinical) for use of regulatory authorities in order to make risk/safety assessments. Originally, GLP regulations were intended for toxicity testing only and were reserved for laboratories undertaking animal studies for preclinical work. GLP is now followed in all laboratories where research or marketing studies are to be submitted to regulatory authorities such as the FDA. Establishment of GLP is mandatory to evaluate safety or toxicity of products intended to undergo clinical trials.Historically, GLP was introduced in several countries (including the United States in 1978) in response to a scandal involving an American industrial product safety testing laboratory in Illinois, the Industrial Bio-Test (IBT) Laboratory. This laboratory performed more than one-third of all toxicology testing in the United States in the 1950s to 1970s, but was found guilty of extensive scientific misconduct, resulting in indictment and convictions of several of its staff in the early 1980s. As data generated by IBT had been used by regulatory authorities for marketing licenses, the United States Environmental Protection Agency was forced to pull several pesticides from the market pending reevaluation of its safety data.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) was first developed in 1978 by an Expert Group led by the United States with experts from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Commission of the European Communities, the WHO, and the International Organization for Standardization. The GLP was formally recommended for use in Member countries in 1981. A more comprehensive document specifying the Principles of GLP was brought out by the OECD in 1992 (revised in 1997) (OECD, 1998) and has since been adopted by several countries and incorporated in national regulatory policies and documents.Compliance with GLP requires that:1. The tests should be conducted by qualified personnel. 2. Each study should have a Study Director responsible for the overall conduct of the tests.3. The laboratory study and the accompanying data should be audited by a Quality Assurance Unit. 4. All laboratory activities must be performed in accordance with written and filed managementapproved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). SOPs should cover policies, administration, equipment operation, technical operation, and analytical methods. 5. All control and test articles and reagents must be identified, characterized, and labeled with information regarding source, purity, stability, concentration, storage conditions, and expiration date. 6. The equipment must be maintained, calibrated, and must be designed to meet analytical requirements.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 208, "text": "(Dolan, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2514, "text": "(OECD, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE"}]}
