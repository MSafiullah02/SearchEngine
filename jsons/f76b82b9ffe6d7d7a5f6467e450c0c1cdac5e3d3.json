This applies to Agile approaches like Scrum, where planning the overall project is forbidden, however planning sprint-by-sprint is mandatory. iAgile is a model for empirical project management of software developments. Inspired by the Agile Manifesto, it has been derived from Scrum, and has been especially tailored for Command and Control (C2) critical systems in the military domain [23] . A C2 system in this domain includes functional military areas to cope with humanitarian assistance, stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and combat operations [25] . The transition to Agile was needed to support faster adaptation to changes to operational needs and quality and security requirements but was also mandated by a drastic reduction in the budgets experienced in Italian public administration. The continual evolution of the operational environment in conflict theaters generates instability of the C2 requirements; this means that their developers have to work at all times with unstable and unconsolidated mission needs. Thus, planning a C2 system using the old, strongly planned, waterfall approach became unsuitable [9] .",

The results using Scrum with some developers rented for specific enhancements were encouraging, however the stakeholders felt that some productivity analysis was necessary. In fact, some aspects of Scrum were not satisfactory for the context of C2 systems developed and operated in-house. Agile approach in the development of critical software  required the solution of many problems and the construction of a solid structure  based on four principles: user community governance, specific Agile training,  new Agile CASE tools and custom Agile development doctrine. Thus for the new developments a method called iAgile was introduced [23] . Table 1 shows how the Agile principles 1 have been embedded in iAgile. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale Sprints lasted 4 weeks + 1 for certification [6] Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project Developers and users worked daily together [3] Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done iAgile has been quite successful, exploting the enthusiasm of both civil and military developers [7] The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation Daily meetings and physical shared taskboard were used systematically [4] Working software is the primary measure of progress",
