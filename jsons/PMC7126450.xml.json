However, its clinical benefit has long been discussed because vaccine responses are reduced by an age-related decline in adaptive immunity [6], [7]. Positive results have been reported from recent meta-analyses: influenza vaccines reduce medically attended influenza by 20\u201344% [8] and influenza-associated hospitalization by 37% in older adults [9]. However, evidence is lacking for the protective effect of influenza vaccination on influenza pneumonia, including primary influenza pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia. In a study by Grijalva et al, influenza vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalization from laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia by 56.7%, although the majority of their patients were people aged <65 years [10]. Therefore, the influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia in older adults remains to be established.",

To investigate IVE, influenza vaccination history was systematically collected at KMC. In this study, pneumonia patients aged \u226565 years who visited KMC from February 2012 to January 2014 were included. The diagnosis of pneumonia was made by staff physicians according to clinical signs, symptoms, and radiological findings. Demographic and clinical information was collected from patients and medical charts. Sputum samples were collected from patients at the time of enrollment. If the patient was unable to cough up sputum, sputum was induced with the inhalation of hypertonic saline solution. Details of study settings and designs have been described previously [2], [13].",

The TND study by Grijalva et al demonstrated that the overall estimate of IVE against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was 56.7% (95% CI, 31.9\u201372.5%) [10].

Therefore, the authors concluded that additional studies were needed to establish the IVE against pneumonia in older adults.

In addition, IVE is usually lower for the H3N2 stain than for the H1N1pdm09 strain [4]. However, our estimates are not dissimilar to those of previous reports: in the study by Grijalva et al, the IVE against influenza pneumonia related to the H3N2 strain in all age groups was 45.1% (95% CI, \u22129.3% to 72.4%) [10], and in another study conducted during the 2011\u201312 influenza season when H3N2 was the dominant circulating strain, the IVE against influenza hospitalization in adults aged \u226565 years was 58.0% (95% CI, 34.2\u201373.2%) [29]. The use of sputum samples in our study may also explain our high IVE estimate. Identification of influenza from sputum samples may be more sensitive and specific than that from upper respiratory tract samples in diagnosing influenza pneumonia and may provide less biased IVE estimates [17], [30], [31].

The opposite finding was observed in the study by Grijalva et al, which included children and adults (\u221221.9% vs. 73.4%) [10]. This difference might be, at least partially, explained by a lower HIV prevalence in our patients. Although seasonal influenza vaccinations have been recommended for adults with immunosuppressive conditions [33], only a few studies have evaluated the IVE against clinical outcomes among this population [34]. Our finding provides supporting evidence for the current recommendations but needs to be confirmed in future studies.",

The burden of pneumonia is rapidly increasing in high-income countries such as Japan because of the aging population [2]. Therefore, the prevention of influenza pneumonia is an important public health measure in controlling pneumonia. The moderate effectiveness observed in our study supports the current seasonal influenza vaccination policy. In Japan, the proportion of people vaccinated against influenza among adults aged \u226565 years has been increasing but still remains approximately 60% [42]. In addition to improving vaccination coverage, an introduction of newer vaccines such as the more immunogenic high-dose influenza vaccine must be considered [43], [44]. On the other hand, it must be noted that only 5% of pneumonia cases have influenza pneumonia, and thus, the impact of influenza vaccination on all-cause pneumonia is limited [45]. Newer multidimensional approaches are needed to reduce the pneumonia burden in the aging population.",

However, our sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations showed very robust estimates. We believe that the exclusion of this patient group did not affect our IVE estimates. Although all potential confounders were considered, unmeasured confounders may have remained. Recently, Andrew et al argued that frailty must be considered in estimating IVE for older adults [29]. We have not measured the frailty of our patients but measured their performance status and BMI. We confirmed that the inclusion of performance status or BMI category in the final model did not change the IVE estimates. Our observation is based on the analyses of older patients aged \u226565 years and therefore may not be generalizable to younger adults. Finally, our sample size was too small to estimate subtype-specific IVE.",
