Fifty-four percent of respondents (163) indicated that they would likely respond to work during an emergency. Although respondents in this study were asked \u201chow confident they were about being safe in their work roles\u201d(33.8% were confident in personal safety), this study did not include statements about level of protection (vaccine vs. personal protective equipment [PPE] vs. all vs. none) as ours did. A large survey of 6428 health care workers (HCWs) from 47 health care facilities in New York City assessed the ability and willingness of responders to report to duty during catastrophic disaster.7 Although more than 80% of HCWs would be willing and/or able to report to work for mass casualty or environmental disasters, only 57% to 68% would be willing and/or able to report to work during a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or smallpox outbreak. The most frequent reasons for not being willing to report to work included fear and concern for family (47%) and self (31%).7 In a 2003 survey of 1919 EMTs, only 65% of respondents were willing to report to work during a smallpox outbreak.8 Although there were no specific questions regarding level of protection against smallpox in this survey, basic and paramedic EMTs who had undergone terrorism-related training were twice as likely to be willing to report to work.8\n",

This acceptance of risk may have been easier given the belief that protective measures were effective (96% of respondents believed this).9 During the SARS outbreak, there were several reports of HCWs in Hong Kong and Toronto either avoiding the physical examination of sick patients or simply refusing work assignments altogether.10 In China, at the height of the SARS epidemic, one hospital had difficulty maintaining services because of absenteeism, some of which was attributed to fear of getting sick.11 Toronto offered U.S. infectious diseases physicians $1400 per day to relieve exhausted Canadian physicians during the height of the second wave of SARS cases in Canada.12\n",

It is likely that vaccine will either be in short supply or not available during a pandemic.2 Similarly, antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) will be scarce and expensive. The Department of Health and Human Services has created priority lists and stockpiling strategies for both vaccine and antivirals2 that are intended to favor first-responders during an outbreak. However, pandemic influenza will strike multiple localities at once, and there will be an intense scramble by state and local governments to acquire resources. Ill-prepared populations will certainly be left behind in the response.",

State and local governments must develop strategies for rapidly inoculating responders when vaccine becomes available. Plans for obtaining and disseminating antivirals must be made well ahead of an outbreak. The federal government has committed to stockpiling Tamiflu and Relenza for 25% of the U.S. population (\u223c80 million courses), but much of that stockpile will be held at the federal level.13 Some states and localities may decide to develop more proximal stockpiles. Hospitals and local governments should consider stockpiling PPE equipment such as surgical masks, N95 masks, gloves, and gowns. These usually common items were suddenly in short supply during the SARS outbreak.14 Finally, first-responders should be educated about how to protect themselves and their families during a pandemic. We believe that educated first-responders who understand that their protection is a priority are more likely to come to work.",
