The algorithm of Needleman-Wunsch is well known for globally aligning two sequences. However, this algorithm is unsuitable for sequences of long length. Many heuristic algorithms are proposed, such as BLAST and FASTA. However, they are still unsuitable for long sequences. In this paper, we study the alignment problem on highly similar sequences. By taking SARS viruses as an example, our result shows that our algorithm runs faster than Clustalx for aligning two SARS viruses. It implies that our algorithm is suitable for viruses of high similarity.",

In 1970, biologists Needleman and Wunsch were the first to analyze biological hereditary information by using electronic calculator. They applied the method of dynamic programming to analyze the similarity between two amino acid sequences [1] . In 1988, the US government established the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to help in creating automatic analyzing system of biological information. This further enhances the ability for biomedical researchers to search and analyze biological information more efficiently and accurately. In 1992, the most famous nuclear acid sequence database, GenBank, began the service for the whole world. It collected more than 150 billion of base pairs counted to February 2013. Meanwhile, in Europe, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) was founded in 1988. In 1990, Japan established their DNA database of Japan (DDBJ). Currently, GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ provide best quality in the search of gene sequence globally.",

Bioinformatics has become the key to answer the mystery of life in the post-genomic era. This paper proposes a sequence alignment algorithm for those DNAs of high similarity. Although the Needleman-Wunsch alignment is the best pairwise sequence alignment algorithm for finding an optimal solution, it is impractical for whole genomes. MUMmer's algorithm needs a very large extra space for saving the suffix tree, and it is also time-consuming for searching MUMs in the suffix tree. We provide another kind of alignment algorithms. It cannot avoid the limitation of O(n 2 ), but it has a good performance for highly similar sequences.",
