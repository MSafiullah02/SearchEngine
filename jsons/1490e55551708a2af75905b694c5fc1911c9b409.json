APN is also a receptor for coronaviruses, the pathogenesis of upper respiratory infection. In recent years, the identification of activities of anti-APN/CD13 monoclonal antibody and natural/synthetic APN inhibitors suggests that APN plays a crucial role in modulating bioactive peptide responses (pain management, vasopressin release) and in influencing immune functions and major biological events (cell proliferation, secretion, invasion, angiogenesis). 2 Therefore, the development of APN inhibitors may be of clinically significance for the discovery of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agents.",
