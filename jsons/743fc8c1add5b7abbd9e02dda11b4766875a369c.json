Currently, the resolution achieved by a screen-film combination of sensitivity class 400 is 2.4 line pairs per millimetre (lp/mm). Radiographic films have characteristic curves that describe the detector. The curves are generally S-shaped. The dynamic range in chest radiography is high, because the lung absorbs only a small amount of radiation, resulting in a high detector dose. In the mediastinum, the absorption of radiation is high, resulting in a low detector dose. Overall, the ratio between the radiation absorption of the highest density structures of the mediastinum and the lungs is about 1:100, thus exceeding the dynamic range of the system.

With a thick section scan (8-10 mm), the sensitivity is only 60-80% and the specificity is 90-100%. Therefore, the technique of choice has been the high-resolution HR-CT with 1-2-mm thick layers reconstructed with a high-resolution, edge-sharpening algorithm. With this technique the sensitivity increased to > 95% with a specificity of 93-100%. A suggested protocol for HR-CT is 1.5 -mm thick sections reconstructed with high-resolution algorithms, with a slice gap of 10 mm from the apex to the base, with a matrix of 521 \u00d7 512 pixels, and a rotation time of maximum 1 second. Multislice CT (MSCT) has revolutionised HR-CT imaging of the lungs with thin isotropic sections enabling excellent multiplanar reconstructions. The course and the calibre of the bronchi can be followed, starting from the level of tracheal bifurcation until well into the lung periphery. Because there are no \"normal\" values for bronchial width, comparison to the contralateral side, as well as to the size of the accompanying pulmonary artery are crucial for the diagnosis of bronchial dilatation. In healthy individuals, it was shown that mild dilatation of the bronchi occurs in up to 26%, with considerable interindividual variability. The diagnosis of bronchial dilatation becomes problematic in patients with enlarged pulmonary arteries, as in pulmonary arterial hypertension or volume load from left to right shunts. Conversely, oligemia is associated with small-sized arteries. It is therefore important to evaluate the second diagnostic criterion, the lack of tapering of the bronchi as well as the third criterion, detection of bronchi in the peripheral third of the lungs.",

On CT, cylindrical bronchiectasis appears as a relatively uniform bronchial dilatation. The most important criterion is the abrupt termination of the bronchiectatic dilatation, as well as the associated changes such as thickened bronchial walls. The latter sign is commonly seen without bronchiectasis in the presence of bronchiolitis.

It leads to bronchiectatic changes of the whole lungs, progressive loss of lung parenchyma, and eventually respiratory insufficiency. The cause is a defect in the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene), which causes abnormal chloride transport and leads to changes in secretion of various exocrine glands. Normally, sodium is absorbed actively along a gradient through a highly selective ion channel. Intracellular sodium is transported to the extracellular fluid via the Na/K pump. Concomitantly, the transport of chloride ions occurs. Furthermore, chloride may be eliminated via selective channels. Because of the defective CFTR protein, chloride transport is hindered. There is intracellular accumulation of chloride ions. Consecutively, sodium and water are transported into the cell to maintain the electrochemical equilibrium.

Smaller particles with a diameter between 5 and 10 microns can penetrate into the lungs. However, these particles are carried away by the cilia in the bronchial tree and coughed out. Relevant dust particles for the development of pneumoconiosis have a diameter of approximately 1-3 microns which can eventually reach the alveoli passing through other natural filter stations. Pneumoconiosis occurs most frequently in the context of occupational exposure to dust. The inhaled dust can either be engulfed by macrophages or directly deposited in the lung tissue. For pneumoconiosis to develop, the defense mechanisms of the lungs must be overwhelmed, meaning that the inhaled dust quantity exceeds the mucociliary clearance function of the lung. Therefore, the dust concentration in the air, the daily exposure time, and the duration of exposure are important factors for development of pneumoconiosis.",

With penetration of one or more ribs through the pleura, pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax may occur. Clinical observation of breathing is important because respiratory movement may be limited by pain or, in the case of multiple rib fractures, an unstable thorax develops. Fractures. Radiologically, there is loss of height of vertebral bodies, such depressed fractures are best seen in the lateral chest radiograph.

Such fractures are best seen in the posteroanterior chest X-ray.
