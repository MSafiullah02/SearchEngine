Instead, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to identify any risk factors of prognostic significance. In this study, the Cox hazard ratio (HR) indicated the probability of recurrent wheezing. First, we analyzed in separate models the interactions between treatment grouping and each risk factor. Then, we used stepwise multivariable model to identify independent risk factors for recurrent wheezing. We included all risk factors, and those interaction terms were included that showed a potential effect on outcome. We used a backward stepwise procedure in which we eliminated factors or interaction terms one by one according to the highest P value >.05.

Thus, the final study cohort consisted of 118 children. Of them, 96 were clinically examined and their parents personally interviewed, and the parents of 22 children were interviewed by phone. Eleven children (9%) were treated for prolonged cough with a continuous inhaled corticosteroid. They were censored from analyses at the time of the initiation of continuous treatment. Of these 11 children, 4 had eczema, 5 were atopic, 7 were rhinovirus-positive, and 6 received prednisolone as the study drug. Their median age was 1.6 years, and median blood eosinophil count was 0.3 \u00d7 109/L. Cough resolved from all these children, but it is not known whether it reappeared after discontinuing the inhaled corticosteroid. The median age of the final study cohort was 1.1 years (range, 0.3-2.9).\nTable I shows the distributions of the host and environment-related risk factors. The risk factor characteristics of prednisolone and placebo groups were comparable (all P values > .28). However, the risk factors were interrelated. Children with eczema had atopic sensitization more often and RSV infection less often than those without eczema (P = .017 and P = .014, respectively). Atopic children were older (P < .001) and more often had blood eosinophilia (\u22650.4 \u00d7 109/L; P = .006) and rhinovirus infection (P = .001) than nonatopic children. Within the 3 viral groups, the RSV group was younger (P = .002) and less often had eczema (P = .014) and eosinophilia (P < .001) than the 2 other viral groups combined, and the rhinovirus group had atopy more frequently than those without rhinovirus infection (P = .001).",

Among the placebo recipients, 61% of children with eczema and 50% of those with rhinovirus infection had recurrent wheezing. The proportions of children with recurrent wheezing seemed to be different among prednisolone recipients and placebo recipients in relation to eczema, maternal asthma, parental smoking, day care attendance, and viral etiology, which indicated a possible interaction between treatment and these risk factors. The separate Cox regression models further suggested an interaction between treatment grouping and eczema (P = .006), day care attendance (P = .023), and the viral etiology of the first episode of wheezing (P = .059). No interaction was identified between treatment grouping and any other risk factor (all P values > .3).

This is in agreement with 2 other recent studies that have also used modern viral diagnostics.2, 11 In a previous Finnish study on early wheezing in hospitalized children (n = 66), 60% had asthma at school age if rhinovirus-positive, whereas only 18% of RSV-positive cases and 29% of rhinovirus-negative cases developed asthma (odds ratio [OR], 4.1 for rhinovirus-positive compared with rhinovirus-negative cases).11 A study from the United States followed a birth cohort with an increased risk of allergies or asthma.2 Of 275 infants, 65% with moderate-to-severe wheezing associated with rhinovirus infection continued to wheeze at the age of 3 years compared with 48% and 49% of infants infected by RSV or other viruses, respectively. The association of wheezing in infancy with persistent wheezing was significantly higher in the rhinovirus group (OR, 10) than in the RSV group (OR, 3.5) and in the RSV/rhinovirus-negative group (OR, 4.6).

First, rhinovirus infections can invade the lower airways, increase their inflammatory responses, and enhance airway hyperresponsiveness.23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Second, as in the other Finnish wheeze study, rhinovirus etiology and risk factors for recurrences were interrelated in our population.11 This implies that these patient groups may be connected to other pre-existing immunologic or genetic factors that predispose to recurrent infections or wheezing.1, 2, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 This suggestion is supported by experimental studies in adults.34, 35 During rhinovirus infection, subjects with high IgE levels, blood eosinophilia, or increased expired nitric oxide had more severe lower respiratory tract symptoms. Third, age at the first infection may also be critical, because immature immune responses may be modified by environmental factors, such as viral infections. This suggestion derived from a neonatal mouse model agrees with our finding that young age at the first episode of wheezing was associated with an increased risk for recurrent wheezing.36\n",

In the rhinovirus group, 50% of placebo recipients had at least 2 recurrences, compared with 26% among prednisolone recipients. This finding is in agreement with our previous report of a 2-month follow-up.20 Contrary to our finding, no disease-modifying effect was seen in 2 recent studies using inhaled corticosteroid therapy either intermittently during wheezing in infants or continuously in children with a positive asthma-predictive index.38, 39 It is, however, important to note that the study by Guilbert et al39 included children who had experienced recurrent wheezing episodes, making their population very different from ours. The reasons for the discrepancy between our study and these earlier studies may lie in our systemic administration and higher dosage of corticosteroids. Thus, our finding suggests that early wheezing associated with rhinovirus is not only an important risk factor for recurrent wheezing but also might be a criterion for the selection of young children who are likely to respond to systemic corticosteroids.",

The treatment was started after a 3-day episode of wheezing in an outpatient setting. Their findings, however, do not necessarily override our results. As they suggested, higher doses and earlier timing of treatment may be necessary. The efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in children with eczema is important to be confirmed by others, because eczema diagnosis would be a useful clinical tool to identify wheezing children who respond to corticosteroids.",

We studied only hospitalized children and had no nonwheezing children as a control group. The inclusion criteria for the long-term follow-up were first planned during the efficacy trial, and thus no stratified randomization was performed. Therefore, we regarded prednisolone versus placebo treatment as an equal covariate to risk factors such as maternal asthma. Our viral grouping can be criticized, although it is in line with that of the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study.2 There is no standard for etiologic grouping. In the regression model, we used the RSV group as a reference group because the probability of recurrent wheezing associated with RSV is well known. To avoid multiple testing and consequent false-positive results, we performed interaction tests instead of testing subgroups, for which we provided only estimates with CIs.41 Although our children had not had previous wheezing requiring outpatient visit or hospitalization, we cannot assure that previous viral infections had not induced lower respiratory symptoms insufficient to result in noticeable wheezing. Prolonged coughing alone can be the dominant symptom under such circumstances. The strengths of this study are careful recording of risk factors, detailed viral diagnostics, prospective follow-up, good adherence of study participants, and use of the general population.",
