In order to properly recapitulate the complex anatomy of the human lung specialized cell culture models have been developed to resemble both the upper and lower airways [ 1 -3 ] . Primary human bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI) system serve as a universal platform to study human respiratory viruses [ 4 -6 ] . These human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures morphologically and functionally resemble the upper conducting airways in vivo. In these cultures, the epithelial layer is pseudostratifi ed and after differentiation they contain many different cell types such as basal, ciliated, and goblet cells and furthermore, generate protective mucus equivalent to that of in vivo epithelium [ 7 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 289, "text": "[ 1 -3 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 447, "end": 455, "text": "[ 4 -6 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 835, "end": 840, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Establishment of HAE cultures requires time and patience but the differentiated cultures allow for a number of advantageous analyses in respiratory virus research.
