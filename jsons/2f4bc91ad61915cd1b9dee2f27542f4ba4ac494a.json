We may refer to these untreated patients as collateral casualties. This has been observed initially in Wuhan 1 and a few days ago in Thailand. 2 We are seeing the same medical situation in our 2 countries, and while facing an unusually high number of casualties ourselves, we are also concurrently witnessing the exponential growth of cases in the United States 3 and fear that this collateral damage situation may soon become a pandemic as well.",

We usually send such patients to the ICU overnight, but given the high proportion of COVID-19 cases in our ICU, we decided to send her to a regular hospital bed instead, after a few hours in the recovery room. Once there, she developed epiglottic edema, and not being immediately intubated or tracheostomized, she died. We consider her to be the collateral casualty of this viral pandemic, knowing well that she would have been saved if the regular protocol could have been followed.",

Due to the scarcity of ICU and hospital beds in Italy and Spain, the health administrations have designated the university hospitals or tertiary referral centers for the critical or complex COVID-19 patients, while other hospitals are being used for other emergencies and the treatment of virus-free patients. This policy may be unsuitable given that the neurosurgical patients require specialized equipment for the treatment of their conditions, which may be available only in the tertiary care medical centers. The most striking examples are young patients harboring neurological tumors or vascular lesions that require urgent nonelective intervention and intensive around-the-clock perioperative care.",

These cases stand to increase during this viral pandemic and in the immediate aftermath to the extent that at some point the number of collateral victims may surpass the direct COVID-19 casualties. Worldwide, the top 2 causes of deaths are ischemic heart disease and stroke, with more than 15 million deaths per year, while the non-COVID lower respiratory disease, be it communicable or otherwise, claims yearly close to 3 million victims. 4 As the mainstream media seem to be more concerned about the mortality rates of the respiratory COVID-19 catastrophe, the collateral damage in this viral war is incurred by other patients, suffering from non-COVID-19 diseases, who deserve the same level of life-saving measures, in our case being the timely administration of appropriate and procedure intensive neurosurgical care.",
