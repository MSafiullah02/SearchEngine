While in these instances PET-CT played a role in supporting the diagnosis, it seems the diagnosis would have been established with CT alone. Using CT alone would also have resulted in a lower radiation exposure 4 . How much did the PET findings really contribute to the diagnosis? Was it truly necessary? Would a CT scan have established the same outcome for lesser cost, lower radiation exposure and greater efficiency?",

Would this be a better use of PET for such patients? After all, as is common knowledge, pulmonary parenchymal changes may persist for quite a long time after resolution of respiratory infective symptoms.",

An excellent visual demonstration was provided by Polverari et al 1 of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) case on positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) using the radiotracer, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Along the same line, the largest series published primarily in English on this topic is that of Qin et al 2 . They also demonstrated unmistakable changes on the PET and CT components. PET clearly complemented the CT findings in all cases (as described in both of the articles).",
