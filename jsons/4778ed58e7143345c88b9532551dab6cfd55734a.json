Taking an environmentally-imposed constraints point of view, we examine behaviors during each of three phases: reacting (e.g., hoarding and rejecting), coping (e.g. maintaining social connectedness, do-it-yourself behaviors, changing views of brands) and longer-term adapting (e.g. potentially transformative changes in consumption and individual and social identity). We discuss implications for marketing researchers and practice.",

Specifically, we propose that as consumers become aware of the potential for a pandemic, they first react by attempting to defend against perceived threats and regain control of lost freedoms. As time passes, they cope by exerting control in other domains and adopting new behaviors. Eventually, consumers adapt over time by becoming less reactive and more resilient. Using this structure, we document a variety of reacting and coping consumer behaviors observed anecdotally and in the popular press, and suggest theories that may help explain and predict these behaviors and associated outcomes. We further explore ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may be serving as a catalyst for consumers' longer-term adaptive responses. While by no means comprehensive, it is our hope that this research can provoke analysis and discussion, serving as a starting point for consumer behavior researchers as well as marketing practitioners.",

Those sounding alarms were frequently viewed as extreme survivalist \"preppers\" who were bound to stock up for any threat, large or small (Austin, 2020) . However, a wave of preparedness buying at the end of February and early March quickly evolved into extreme buying with an 845% spike in consumer household spending (NCSolutions, 2020); a level which could not be met by suppliers, leading to empty shelves, stock-outs and product scarcity. Shoppers quickly cleared the shelves of all manner of disinfectant and cleaning products, toilet paper, and even water (NCSolutions, 2020) . Whereas some of these goods, such as toilet paper, are often hoarded at first signs of a natural disaster (Kaigo, 2012) , cleaning products might be more unique to a pandemic. What kinds of products consumers hoarded in the COVID-19 pandemic, and why, are interesting questions for researchers, especially given scientists' view of the likelihood of either another wave of COVID-19 or of future pandemics.",

Hoarding behavior has an evolutionary basis and is instinctual when a threat is perceived (Frost & Gross, 1993) . It is motivated by fear of being caught unprepared (Frost & Gross, 1993) and is heightened following an adverse event due to an increase in risk-aversion (Cameron & Shah, 2015) and anticipated regret (Gupta & Gentry, 2019) . Further, according to psychological reactance theory (Clee & Wicklund, 1980) , a threat to product availability is experienced by consumers as a loss of control and increases the perceived need for the threatened object. Possession, therefore, restores this loss of control and contributes to a sense of security and comfort (Frost & Hartl, 1996) . Thus, while some degree of hoarding might be warranted for preparedness, consumers also engage in hoarding beyond what is needed as an emotional reactance response (Sneath, Lacey, & Kennett-Hensel, 2009 ).",

Keeping empty store shelves stocked with substitute products (e.g. facial tissues for toilet paper or soap for disinfectant) might also help to avoid cuing scarcity, thus dampening consumers' reactance responses. In response to stock-outs, consumers are also more likely to pay attention to the supply and demand of goods (Ge, Messinger, & Li, 2009) , so even providing consumers with information regarding anticipated deliveries may help restore their sense of control.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), social distancing encompasses efforts to lower the risk of exposure by limiting personal contact with others, maintaining distance from others, and taking other precautionary actions such as wearing masks and gloves (Bates, 2020) . One of the hallmarks of social distancing practices was \"sheltering in place,\" or stay-at-home orders. However, the need to belong is one of the most fundamental human motivations (Baumeister & Leary, 1995) and consumers showed remarkable innovativeness and resiliency in order to meet this need. For example, when the virus made selfquarantining obligatory, many people chose to abandon their own homes in order to shelter in place with friends or family members, giving rise to the term \"quaranteaming\" (Hohman, 2020) .",

Despite emerging touch capabilities in virtual reality (Needleman, 2018) , it is unlikely that humans' positive responses to interpersonal touch (Luangrath, Peck, & Gustafsson, 2020) will be replaced virtually anytime soon. Further, when video chatting, consumers may see not only the others in the group, but also an image of themselves, possibly increasing stress due to self-presentation concerns (Wegge, 2006) . Consumers also report \"ZOOM fatigue,\" which might result from cognitive challenges associated with this less natural communication technology. Chatting via video (vs. in person) requires more attention to the faces on the screen and the cognitive load of trying to see and interpret nonverbal cues in this restricted environment (Ferran & Watts, 2008 ) may be exhausting. The conversation flow is also less natural, as the technology does not permit everyone to hear multiple consumers speaking simultaneously. Research has also shown that individuals may also misattribute brief system delays or other technical glitches to a communication partner, thereby affecting their perception of the other's behaviors and personality (Schoenenberg, Raake, & Koeppe, 2014) .",

Use of video chat for professional use is generally a result of extrinsic or utilitarian motivations, whereas social contexts are likely to be more intrinsically or hedonically motivated, likely changing consumers' reactions to the technology (Kirk, Swain, & Gaskin, 2015) . Another phenomenon seems to be a need for reconnecting with people from our past during the pandemic (Firth, 2020) especially through video chats, and the reasons for this are not clear. It is possible this is due to a sense of nostalgia (Xinyue, Wildschut, Sedikides, Kan, & Cong, 2014) or increased mortality salience (Dunn, White, & Dahl, 2020) , and this should be examined. Even so, hedonic motivations aside, consumers might also feel pressured to join a group video chat with friends or relatives since everyone knows they are home. This might impact their sense of autonomy and dampen pleasurable responses from using the technology. Further research examining use of video chatting technology in social contexts is much needed.",

For example, Duchenne smiles, which crinkle the corners of the eyes, convey intrinsic motivation (Cheng, Mukhopadhyay, & Williams, 2020 ) and should be visible even when the mouth is covered. Other body language or prosody (Frick, 1985) may also be needed to avoid miscommunication. One could imagine a market for face coverings that provide protection yet are transparent enough to keep facial expressions visible. At the same time, many consumers are starting to treat fabric face masks as an expressive accessory by acquiring or making them of specialized fabrics in identity-relevant colors or patterns. Unfortunately, consumers of color, especially men, have reported additional concerns since face coverings can play into racial biases and may be viewed as threatening.

It is conceivable that in order to enter a mall, store or other establishment, individuals will go through a screening device preventing those who are potentially ill from entering. Eventually, this practice could extend to wearables, whereby these diagnostics are available for every individual 24/7.

The Chinese government, in partnership with industry, recently instituted a \"Chinese citizen score,\" which utilizes artificial intelligence, surveillance footage, customer transactional data and other digital footprints to reward and punish individuals based on unspecified criteria (Botsman, 2017) . Over and above the citizen score, the government requires residents to download a health code app which dictates which residents must be under a mandatory quarantine and then can use the GPS function to ensure compliance (Valentino-DeVries et al., 2020) . This reveals the potential power of these data capabilities and foreshadows the consequences of the trade-off of tolerating privacy and surveillance for safety. While the efforts in the United States are not as overt, the frequency and severity of data protection failures in the United States gives reason to pause (Singer, 2020) . However, given the life and death consequences of COVID-19 tracking, it is likely that the balance between safety and surveillance will lean further towards the former (Valentino-DeVries et al., 2020).",

Numerous realities during the COVID-19 pandemic defied expectations beyond imagination. Among the most serious transgressions were individuals left to die alone while loved ones were forced to stay away, medical personnel compelled to choose who would and would not receive life-saving treatment, and families precluded from carrying out funerals and other rituals related to the grieving process due to social distancing. First responders and other essential workers were worn out as they risked their own health and those of their families, while many others were furloughed or unemployed. As individuals sought to protect their own interests, often helping the most vulnerable populations took a back seat, with perhaps the exception of the emptying out of animal shelters. Individuals will need to come to terms with their own behaviors such as shaming and being shamed. Further, many have questioned whether those in authority could have mitigated the negative outcomes if they acted collectively, sooner, better, more efficiently and so on.

For example, avatars, virtual robotics and other digital and AI technologies afford individuals the opportunity to play out alternate versions of themselves through magical universes and masked identities (Hooi & Cho, 2014) . This is not a new phenomenon in that throughout history, scholars have questioned the distinction between fantasy and reality (Mattessich, 2003) . For example, where would one cross the line in Disney's Magic Kingdom in comparison to the lights of Times Square in New York City, or a planned community (F\u0131rat & Dholakia, 2006) ? It has been suggested that the current reality is merely a simulation constructed by past human agency (Baudrillard & Foss, 1983; F\u0131rat & Dholakia, 2006) . The potential for reality and fantasy to be indistinguishable, however, becomes much greater with the sophistication of AI and other technological innovations, which will enable computers and robots to replicate human qualities linguistically, physically, intellectually and emotionally (Belk, 2019 (Belk, , 2020 . Robots and humans will become interchangeable as they take on anthropomorphized personas capable of satisfying both physical and emotional needs (Belk, 2019) . Paradoxically, humans are predicted to become more machine-like as they carve out digital representations of the self which are \"more anonymous, invisible, fanciful, and even imaginary\" (Belk, 2020, p. 2) .",

For example, the economic and financial impacts are already devastating for many consumers, often forcing them into modern-day versions of depression-era breadlines for the first time in their lives just to feed their families (Meyerson, 2020) . The disastrous economic effects are hitting women and minority populations the hardest, because they have fewer assets to enable them to weather the storm, and because they are less likely to hold white-collar jobs that can be done remotely (Knowledge@Wharton, 2020). School and daycare center closings have made the pandemic especially devastating for women with young children who need day care (Alon, Deopke, Olmstead-Rumsey, & Tertilt, 2020) . Even the health effects of COVID-19 are disproportionately affecting minority populations in the U.S., for reasons that are still emerging (CDC, 2020) . We have also not discussed the outpouring of prosocial behavior and gratitude for front-line workers on display by consumers every day. Consumers are donating blood and opening their homes, risking their lives as volunteers, and across the world, thanking healthcare workers by singing from their balconies, applauding, and honking horns (Snouwaert, 2020) .",

Taking an environmentallyimposed constraints perspective, we have offered insights based on theory to help understand these behaviors in order to inform future research and marketing practice. We have addressed consumer behaviors in each of three phases: reacting (e.g., hoarding and rejecting), coping (e.g. maintaining social connectedness, do-it-yourself behaviors, changing views of brands) and longer-term adapting (e.g. potentially transformative changes in consumption and individual and social identity). Although the economic and research opportunities are unlimited, we suggest just a few areas as a starting point: \uf0b7 How will virtual and remote consumer experiences reset consumer expectations, wants and needs for future engagement? \uf0b7 How will consumers shift their lifestyle and consumption priorities (e.g. greater work life balance, more or less emphasis on trivialities, desire for greater independence or interdependence)?",
