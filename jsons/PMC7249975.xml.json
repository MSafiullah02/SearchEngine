Two independent reviewers (M.A. and R.F.) performed screening and data extraction of articles. Articles were selected if they reported data on COVID-19 patients with respect to hypoalbuminemia. Discrepancy in screening/data collection was resolved through mutual discussion. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, and odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) for proportional and continuous variables were computed, respectively. For each outcome, forest plot, 95% confidence interval (CI), p value (< 0.05 considered statistically significant), and I2 statistic (> 50% considered as substantial heterogeneity) was generated using Open Meta Analyst (CEBM, Oxford, UK).",

The hallmark of severe COVID-19 includes the cytokine storm and an interplay of some of the aforementioned mechanisms [1].",
