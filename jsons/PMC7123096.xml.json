Additionally, structural airway abnormalities may warrant higher positive-pressure ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in particular, to maintain ventilation around functional residual capacity. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and aggressive pulmonary toilet may be required after extubation. Lastly, providers should be aware of the risk of post-obstructive pneumonia.",

Risk factors for respiratory tract infections particularly relevant to ACHD patients include underlying immunodeficiency or leukocyte wasting (see section on infectious diseases), chronic malnutrition, airway abnormalities, and history of vocal cord paresis increasing aspiration risk. Malnutrition in particular results in depressed immune function and muscle wasting with consequent poor respiratory effort and atelectasis, also increasing the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation and impaired airway clearance.",

Diaphragm paralysis results in elevation of the hemidiaphragm, decreased lung excursion, and atelectasis and is an independent predictor of moderately to severely depressed FVC (odds ratio 4.64) [1]. Chest wall abnormalities due to scoliosis and prior thoracotomies also independently predict moderately to severely impaired lung function (odds ratio 3.2 and 1.9, respectively) [1]. The presence of scoliosis may result in reduced lung volumes on the side of the greater curvature, reduced number of alveoli and a proportional increase in \u201cremnant alveolar\u201d space closer to the spinal curvature, and abnormal development of the muscles of respiration [23, 24]. Therefore, the presence of scoliosis should factor into decisions regarding ventilation expectations and strategies to maintain adequate lung expansion. Scoliosis may complicate neck mobilization and airway visualization, possibly requiring specialized personnel and equipment for successful laryngoscopy and intubation [25\u201327].",

The intraparenchymal airways may be compressed by edema of the peribronchial wall or vessels (\u201cperibronchial cuffing\u201d), leading to an obstructive pattern of lung disease [13, 28, 29].

Without a fenestration or baffle leak, cardiac output may be impaired due to reduced preload to the systemic ventricle. The increase in Fontan pressures due to higher positive airway pressures can lead to ascites and pleural effusions, further impairing ventilation thus requiring even higher positive airway pressures.

Although patients with PLE have the most profound abnormalities, patients without overt PLE may also have some degree of lymphopenia, presumably due to a chronic low level of protein wasting [67, 72]. These abnormalities are more pronounced later after Fontan operation, with a fourfold increase in the odds of significant lymphopenia in the second decade after Fontan [67]. Depressed immunoglobulin G levels are also found in patients with PLE with an associated impaired response to the pneumococcal, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccines. Despite this, PLE is not associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, nor is it a risk factor for hospitalization for infection [67, 72]. Although not a risk factor in isolation, in the ICU setting, it is important to recognize the potential for baseline immunodeficiency and increased risk of infection.

            "text": "The risk of infective endocarditis (IE) is higher in ACHD patients compared to the general population [73\u201378]. In a study of over 4000 ACHD patients, the incidence of IE was 3%, with the highest rates occurring in patients with unrepaired VSDs, repaired tetralogy of Fallot, and cyanotic heart disease [78]. The mortality rate of adult CHD patients with IE ranges from 4 to 8% [75]. In-hospital mortality is more likely to occur in those patients who have at least one prior cardiac surgery, patients with prosthetic material as part of their repair, patients with prior episodes of endocarditis or an intracardiac abscess, and patients of an older age [75, 76]. A specific cause of IE is identified in only 26\u201330% of ACHD patients [75, 79], and only 70% of patients have an identifiable source of infection by cardiac imaging [76], likely related to difficulty visualizing the intracardiac structures due to prosthetic materials and limited acoustic windows. ACHD patients may present with heart failure, embolic phenomena, or worsening valvar dysfunction as the heralding signs of IE [76]. The presence of any of these findings with associated fevers or elevated inflammatory markers, even in the absence of an identified vegetation by imaging or positive blood cultures, should raise suspicion for endocarditis. The most common organisms that cause IE in ACHD patients mirror those in the general population: streptococci and staphylococci [76]. Patients should therefore receive broad antibiotic coverage while awaiting blood culture results and speciation of organisms. Because of the potential limitations of echocardiography, PET/CTA is an emerging diagnostic modality in patients where the diagnostic suspicion is high or the identification of the site of infection may inform the decision between medical therapy and surgical intervention [76].",

However, the number of patients with active infections, indicated by the presence of HCV RNA, is lower [80, 81]. Patients with more complex congenital heart lesions are more likely to have been exposed to HCV due to higher blood product exposure [80, 82, 83].

Many of the risk factors for pressure ulcer development in the general adult population are frequently encountered in the ACHD population, including cardiac surgery, long hospital length of stay, long duration of mechanical ventilation, limited mobility, and infrequent repositioning. Chronic malnutrition contributes to decreased subcutaneous tissue, revealing more superficial pressure points, as well as hypoalbuminemia and poor wound healing. Use of vasoactive infusions is associated with pressure ulcer development due to the underlying low perfusion state as well as the medication-induced peripheral vasoconstriction [84]. Attention should be paid to frequent monitoring of adult patients for ulcer development, early treatment, repositioning of immobile patients, use of pressure-alleviating mattresses and devices on pressure points, optimization of nutritional status, and frequent ambulation when the patient is able.",

A recent Japanese study found D-dimer was significantly elevated in patients with Fontan circulation and an intracardiac thrombus versus controls [101]. While an elevated D-dimer may prompt consideration of a CT pulmonary angiogram, CT-PA imaging is technically difficult in the Fontan circulation given increased venous transit time and often unbalanced streaming from the SVC and IVC to the right and left pulmonary arteries. A bolus of contrast from an upper extremity injection may stream into one lung. The absence of complete filling of the contralateral lung may raise concern for thrombus. An increased interval of time from contrast administration to image acquisition and/or simultaneous upper and lower limb injections may mitigate these technical issues [102].",

Depression has been associated with increased perioperative pain in coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients [119]. Screening for depression prior to surgery may help the ICU team anticipate perioperative issues of pain control, delirium, and sleep disturbance, as well as help ensure depression is properly treated postoperatively.",

There is conflicting data association between SSRI use and increased perioperative bleeding, possibly due to effects on platelet aggregation, with a 2010 study of CABG patients showing no significant increased bleeding risk [121]. Typically, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are continued perioperatively as acute withdrawal can provoke flu-like symptoms, sleep disruption, altered sensation, changes in mood/thinking, and abnormal movements, including tardive dyskinesia. Given the potential for withdrawal phenomenon, stopping other medications which may have effects on platelet function such as NSAIDs should be considered first.",
