            "text": "Three types of molecular descriptors, extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP), functional-class fingerprints (FCFPs), and octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (ALogP_count), were performed to AI learning. The extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are generated in a molecule-directed manner by systematically recording the neighborhood of each non-hydrogen atom into multiple circular layers up to a given diameter of that molecule. The functional-class fingerprints (FCFPs) [7] detail circular fingerprints via the pharmacophore identification of atoms, which reports topological pharmacophore fingerprints. The ALogP_count is an array of 120 numbers that correspond to the 120 Ghose and Crippen atom types [8]. The 613 descriptors in total were used for the AI practices and prediction of the promising drugs. All these descriptors were generated by Discovery Studio v18.1/Calculates ligand properties program (BIOVIA Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), including ALogP_count (101 descriptors), ECFP_4 (256 descriptors), and FCFP_4 (256 descriptors) as shown in the supplemental information. The system used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) [9] algorithm to identify the most important descriptors and gave different weightings to generate AI prediction models. We collected information of those compounds and drugs that had been reported with promising activities for treating COVID-19, such as anti-influenza drugs [10], drugs and compounds inhibiting SARS-CoV [11], HIV drugs [12], and some showing activities against SARS-CoV-2 as recently reported [13,14]. The other AI prediction model is generated from a learning dataset of 210 drugs and compounds reported with inhibitory activities on the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV listed in Table 1\n[[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]].

Together with the 5 additional drugs identified during the current AI approach and drug repurposing practices, there are 13 drugs with great potentials for further development toward treating COVID-19. Chloroquine showed inhibition activity against FIP virus at 10 \u03bcM, which is in agreement with the recent report about its broad-spectrum antiviral effects and it is one of the drugs used to treat COVID-19 patients in China and authorized for emergency use in United States [14]. Remdesivir is a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor and a promising drug candidate for treating COVID-19 [4]; now used in COVID-19 patients in clinical trials in a number of countries including Taiwan. GS-441524 is the active metabolite of remdesivir and showed activity against FIP virus at around 2 \u03bcM similar to the previously reported for GS-441524 being developed as a veterinary medicine treating feline coronavirus infections [4]. The results therefore provide solid evidence to support the validity of using cell-based FIP virus infection in vitro model as an antiviral activity assay in the present study. To have the promising drugs further being tested in a SARS-CoV-2 in vitro assay and in vivo animal models is planned to be ongoing.",

It was also used as an immunosuppressant in combination with other drugs such as cyclosporine for synergism [44]. It is of high water solubility and given by IV infusion. The biodistribution studies in rats of brequinar showed that liver and small intestines were the most exposed organs. The elimination rate of brequinar from all tissues were approximately equal to that from the blood circulation indicating no tissue accumulation of the intact drug molecules [45]. The present finding demonstrated that brequinar has an inhibiting activity of 2\u201310 \u03bcM. The systemically exposed plasma concentration range of brequinar in patients are around 73\u2013261 \u03bcM for doses of 135\u2013300 m2/kg in 5-day infusion period suggesting that brequinar may be effective against coronaviruses in appropriate dose regimens given alone or in combination with others [44].",

Two independent datasets were compiled as the learning inputs to generate two AI prediction models of different approaches. Firstly, Model 1 was generated form the known drugs with antiviral activities. Model 2 was generated form the 3C-like protease inhibitors. A database for the market-approved drugs were adopted in which the AI system screens for potential drugs with antiviral activities. The AI-predicted drugs were verified with antiviral activities by a cell-based FIP virus replication assay. Finally, these assay results served as feedbacks for the AI relearning and evolution progress. The Modified AI model was established to screen further and again verified by the FIP virus replication assay. The processing flows are indicated with the arrows.",
