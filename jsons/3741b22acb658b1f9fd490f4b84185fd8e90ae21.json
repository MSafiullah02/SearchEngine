SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry and damage the target organ 3 . The expression of ACE2 receptors has been suggested in both liver and bile duct cells 4.5 . Previous studies have reported abnormalities in transaminases in 14-53% cases of COVID-19 patients 1 . We also noticed elevations in liver chemistries from baseline values, suggesting possible liver injury from SARS-CoV-2. However, we cannot rule out medications or other possible etiologies for these abnormalities and are unable to specify a pattern of liver injury. Hypoxia often seen in COVID-19 can induce diminished cellular activity and high-level oxygen free radical resulting in liver injury and organ failure 1,6 . COVID-19 patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, especially with cirrhosis, are theoretically more susceptible to poor outcomes from these direct injuries to liver. Moreover, the immune deficiency and accompanying persistent systemic inflammation reflected by the activated circulating immune cells and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease can predispose them to uncontrollable pro-inflammatory cytokines production 6, 7 . Many patients with cirrhosis can also have underlying hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, or hepatic hydrothorax that can increase the risk of respiratory failure in itself 8 .",
