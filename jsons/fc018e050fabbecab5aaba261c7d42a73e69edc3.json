Subsequently, to measure the impact of the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) on gene expression, either two or three mutations were introduced into the ORF 7a/b TRS hexanucleotide site of the luciferase cassette; SARS 2mut-Luc and SARS 3mut-Luc, respectively ( Figure 1 ).

The growth kinetics of all three constructs was similar, suggesting that the TRS mutations did not effect the efficacy of virus replication. However, Western blot analysis detected Luciferase protein in the SARS wt-Luc construct but did not detect the expression of any Luciferase protein in cells infected with the 2mut and 3mut recombinant viruses. Likewise, Northern blot analysis exhibited a severely decreased amount of subgenomic Luciferase mRNA in cells infected with the two mutant constructs (data not shown). Combined, these results effectively demonstrate that the TRS mutations attenuate the virus' ability to efficiently produce or translate subgenomic mRNA. This analysis was verified utilizing the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) to detect Luciferase enzyme activity. The Luciferase expression, measured in relative light units (RLU), decreased from almost 1 log to approximately 1.5 logs in cells infected with the 2mut and 3mut constructs, respectively ( Figure 2 ).",
