A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this crosssectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR = 8.71, 95%CI:1.97-38.43), being the enterprise employee (OR = 2.36, 95%CI:1.09-5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR = 1.05, 95%CI:1.03-1.07) and using negative coping styles (OR = 1.03, 95%CI:1.00-1.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.

A new coronavirus was subsequently identified as the pathogen and was temporarily named the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] . On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Infectious diseases have become one of the major threats to global public health in the twenty-first century [2] ; such diseases impact both physical health and mental health [3, 4] . As of February 18, 2020, 57805 people have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, leading to 2004 deaths across 31 provinces in mainland China [5] . The outbreak of COVID-19 in China caused public panic and mental health stress, with an increasing number of cases being diagnosed and some countries appearing to have confirmed cases and public concerns about infection [6] .",

These types of epidemics lead the public to experience psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, depression and anxiety [11] . Some studies have shown that post-traumatic stress disorder is closely related to depression and other psychological problems [12] . According to a theoretical model developed by Ehlers and Clark [13] , after experiencing a traumatic event, individuals may make a negative assessment of the trauma and its sequelae. In this way, they may easily to adopt maladaptive strategies to maintain PTSD symptoms such as invasion, arousal symptoms and strong negative emotions [14] . Therefore, this study assumes that youth groups may have a tendency to develop psychological problems after experiencing traumatic stress disorder.",

This study found that compared to women, men scored significantly higher on the GHQ-12, PTSD and negative coping scales, which is inconsistent with other research results [34, 35] , The difference may be due to different coping styles and social roles. Women were more likely to show symptoms of PTSD during the COVID-19 outbreak, which may reduce the incidence of PTSD [36] , but men may take more responsibility leading to stress, PTSD symptoms and psychological distress symptoms [37] . Regarding factors of educational level, participants with a lower education were more likely to show PTSD symptoms and psychological distress, which is consistent with other research results [38] . In this study, LSD post-hoc comparisons were used to discover differences between different educational levels. The participants with junior high school or below educational level had higher PTSD and GHQ-12 scores than other groups, which may be because a higher level of education can improve one's understanding of issues related to post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological distress, leading one to take positive measures to prevent related symptoms from appearing and increasing confidence in mental health recovery [39] . In terms of marital status, the LSD post-hoc comparisons revealed that the divorced/widowed participants had significantly higher PTSD and GHQ-12 scores than single and married/cohabitating participants; this difference may be due to family financial loss, a lack of support against negative emotions or depression symptoms [40, 41] and a lack of opportunities to communicate with family members leading to psychological problems such as depression and anxiety, which highlight the importance of family support during this emergency [12] . In the professional dimension, this study found that business groups have significantly higher PTSD scores than the other four groups, which may be because during the occurrence of COVID-19, compared to other professions, the businessman who needed to trade with others were worried about being infected and had some PTSD symptoms.",

These groups may experience long-term mental health problems because they lack the ability to recover from emergencies [8] . The government and relevant psychological institutions should take relevant psychological counseling measures to help this group recover from the impact of COVID-19. In addition, it also found that the enterprise employees may occurrence to the tendency of psychological distress, because during the occurrence of COVID-19, the working style of employees has changed. Faced with the sudden change of working style, they may not be able to adapt to this changes in a short time and cause certain psychological pressure. However, the specific reasons need to be further confirmed in the future. Using negative coping was also a predictive factor for the tendency of psychological distress, and studies showed that negative coping styles were linked to mental health issues [42] . These group used negative, avoidance-focused coping as a risk factor for post-traumatic symptoms [43] . Furthermore, post-traumatic symptoms were a strong predictor of psychological distress [12] . Thus, PTSD symptoms and negative coping styles were strong predictors of youth mental health with respect to COVID-19.",

Thus, further research should use a longitudinal design. Second, this study used self-reported questionnaires, which have issues with subjectivity and reliability. In addition, because of the limited sample size and snowball sampling approach, these findings may not represent the entire youth population. Therefore, a larger sample size might be needed. Finally, other variables affecting youth mental health with respect to COVID-19 should be examined.",
