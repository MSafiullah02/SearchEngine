            "text": "Machine learning algorithms have been widely used for predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. However, the scarcity of training data for specific kinases makes it difficult to train effective models for predicting their phosphorylation sites. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning framework, PhosTransfer, for improving kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction. It banks on the hierarchical information encoded in the kinase classification tree (KCT) which involves four levels: kinase groups, families, subfamilies and protein kinases (PKs). With PhosTransfer, predictive models associated with tree nodes at higher levels, which are trained with more sufficient training data, can be transferred and reused as feature extractors for predictive models of tree nodes at a lower level. Out results indicate that models with deep transfer learning out-performed those without transfer learning for 73 out of 79 tested PKs. The positive effect of deep transfer learning is better demonstrated in the prediction of phosphosites for kinase nodes with less training data. These improved performances are further validated and explained by the visualisation of vector representations generated from hidden layers pre-trained at different KCT levels.",

The identification of phosphorylation sites in substrate sequences represents an important step toward a deeper understanding of cell singling processes. Dozens of computational tools have been developed to automatically identify phosphorylation sites from protein sequences [9, 12, 15, 19, 23] . They are generally categorised into two types, general phosphorylation site (GPS) prediction and kinase-specific phosphorylation site (KPS) prediction. In GPS prediction, any Serine(S), Threonine(T) and Tyrosine(Y) site is classified either as a phosphorylation site or not, irrespective of the specific kinase that catalyses the phosphorylation. However, due to structural differences among different kinases, their target substrates have to meet kinase-specific requirements, including residue patterns. With KPS prediction, such patterns are taken into account.",

Yet, kinases are classified into groups, families and subfamilies according to the sequential pattern of their catalytic domains, resulting in a kinase classification tree (KCT) [14] . In GPS 2.0, this KCT was used as heuristic for KPS prediction for the first time [22] . It provided a new hierarchical perspective for investigating kinase-specific phosphorylation. However, due to the lack of phosphosites annotated for specific kinases, few methods approached KPS prediction in such a hierarchical manner. A more recently work Musit-eDeep [18] implemented the idea of transfer models in GPS prediction for KPS prediction. But it did not explore the effect of transfer learning using heuristic from the hierarchy of the KCT.",

[14] , there are 8 major kinase groups, each of which has multiple kinase families and subfamilies with individual PKs clustered to different subfamilies, forming a KCT of four levels.

GPS 2.0 [22] proposed to use the annotated phosphosites of kinase nodes at lower levels to train models for their ancestor kinase nodes at higher levels. In this case, the training data is reused in a bottom-up manner. In contrast, we adopted the general idea of transfer learning [16] to transfer the knowledge learned for kinase nodes at higher levels to descendant kinase nodes at lower levels, in a top-down manner.",

According to Fig. 2 , models 1 , 4 , 7 and 11 are based on the single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), to which no deep transfer learning was applied. All other models are deep transfer learning models with different numbers of pretrained hidden layers. Therefore, models 1 , 4 , 7 and 11 correspond to model M while all others correspond to model M . For each tested kinase node n, we then calculated the P IR between the best performing deep transfer learning model and the corresponding SLFN-based model, and plot the calculated PIR score with respect to the number of phosphosites of n. Figure 4 depicts the scatter plot, with each point representing a node's relationship between performance improvement rate and number of annotated phosphosites. According to the results, the prediction performance for kinases with insufficient annotated sites are more likely to improve when deep transfer learning was applied. While for kinases with more than 400 annotated sites, the prediction performance was improved by no more than 10% compared to the performance of the SLFN-based models. However, there is no guarantee for kinases with less annotated sites to have their prediction model's performance improved, when deep transfer learning is applied. Other factors, such as the local sequential patterns, may also affect the P IR of deep transfer learning models. Nevertheless, the results confirmed the positive effect of deep transfer learning in predicting phosphorylation sites for kinases with insufficient annotations.",

This framework was inspired by the hierarchical classification system of kinases and transfer learning. The basic idea is that phosphorylation sites of protein kinases within the same subfamily, family and group are likely to share similar local sequential and structural patterns, therefore models trained for higher level kinase nodes, which have more sufficient training data, can be transferred (reused) as feature extractors for lower level kinase nodes. When combined with deep learning, this idea is implemented in form of convolutional neural networks with multiple hidden layers, where each layer was trained individually based on the annotated phosphosites of kinase groups, families, subfamilies and PKs that are on the same tree path.",

            "text": "According to our investigation, the improved performance achieved by Phos-Transfer is affected by the following factors. First, the performance improvement rate of PhosTransfer is related to the number of annotated phosphosites of the kinase node itself. For protein kinases with sufficient training data (more than 400 annotated phosphosites), the prediction performance was improved no more than 10% when PhosTransfer was applied. This indicates that the application of PhosTransfer does address the issue of overfitting during the process of model training for kinase nodes with insufficient training data. Second, the number of phosphosites of the group itself can affect the prediction performance for families, subfamilies and PKs within this group. The basic idea of PhosTransfer is that the models trained for kinase nodes (especially, kinase groups) with more sufficient training data can be reused as feature extractors for kinase nodes with insufficient training data. However, if the kinase group itself does not have enough annotated phosphosites, this idea may not work properly. This explains the unsatisfactory performance of PhosTransfer in groups STE and Atypical, which had the least annotated phosphosites among all kinase groups. Third, the prediction performance of PhosTransfer is negatively correlated to the motif diversity of the phosphorylation sites in the training data. According to [2] , PROSITE motifs could recognise only 10% of annotated Y phosphorylation sites [17] , which may explain the unsatisfactory performance of PhosTransfer for kinases in group TK.",

For any subfamily s in kinase family f , we reused the hidden layer h g 1 and h f 2 (fixed) for feature extraction and top-up a third hidden layer h s 3 (trainable) for kinase subfamily s. For example, when g = AGC and f = PKC subfamily s \u2208 {Alpha, . . .}. Level 4 (Protein kinase).

In order to explore the large amount of S/T/Y phosphorylation sites that are not specifically annotated for any kinase, we added an extra level on top of the level kinase group in the KCT, namely, the Level 0 (AA type), for which the single hidden layer h aa 0 is inserted and trained as the feature extractor for subsequent hidden layers h g 1 , h f 2 , h s 3 and h k 4 .
