For roughly 10 years after the first HIV case was first discovered on the mainland in 1986 (a foreign national diagnosed with AIDS), the best information available was from case reporting. However, during this period, nearly all cases were identified very late, when patients presented to hospitals with already severe symptoms of advanced HIV disease or AIDS. Thus, case reporting information was already many years out of date, and policymakers were unable to see the current picture of the HIV epidemic during this time. To make matters worse, while there were certainly more people living with HIV (PLWH) who were still undiagnosed compared to those diagnosed and therefore counted among case reports (i.e. a total of 20,711 by the end of 2003), there was uncertainty and substantial worry surrounding just how many Chinese citizens had HIV infection and did not know it (Wang et al. 2010).",

This system did not take the place of case reporting. Rather, it acted in parallel, and the two sources of information were complementary to each other. The surveillance system began with collection of data among key, high-risk groups including drug users, female sex workers (FSW), pregnant women, sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic attendees, long-distance truck drivers, and military recruits. It also began with data collection in geographical areas most affected by the HIV epidemic based on case reports, for example, Yunnan province. Although the system started out very small, with only 42 sentinel sites operating from 1995 to 1996, it quickly expanded both in terms of numbers of sites (i.e. 101 by 2000 and 194 by 2003) and in terms of key populations covered (i.e. former plasma donors [FPD] were added in 1998, men who have sex with men [MSM] were added in 2002). This system became a key source of information for HIV/AIDS policy formulation (Lin et al. 2012) (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_2 for more information).",

For example, behavioral surveillance among some risk groups began in 2004, active testing campaigns were launched in 2004 and 2005, improved methods of estimating the total number of PLWH in China (diagnosed and undiagnosed) were incorporated and made routine in 2005, and several large, special epidemiological surveys were conducted beginning in the latter half of the 2000s. Many international aid programs were also generating data during this time as well and all of these sources of partially overlapping and nonstandardized data gathered via disparate methods began to be overwhelming. The days of not having enough data were over, but the true nature of the epidemic was not clearer. Thus, in 2008, China launched its National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management System (CRIMS), which integrated eight smaller systems (i.e. case reporting, testing and counseling, sentinel surveillance, behavioral surveillance, antiretroviral therapy [ART] for adults, ART for children, high-risk group behavioral intervention, and methadone maintenance treatment [MMT]) and one new system (i.e. county demographic information) into a single, unified, web-based, real-time monitoring and evaluation data system. From 2008 on, CRIMS has been the primary source of data informing policy development and implementation for China\u2019s HIV/AIDS response (Mao et al. 2010) (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_24 for more information).",

This spurred the Chinese Government to take action, issuing a series of early policies focused mainly on preventing the virus from entering the country, whether carried by infected individuals or by contaminated blood products. Foreign students, researchers, business people, and others visiting China on 12-month visas had to submit to an HIV test within 1 month of entering the country. Foreigners already residing in China for more than 12 months were required to provide health certificates that specified HIV status. HIV testing was set up at major border crossings and customs checkpoints and in large cities. Foreigners attempting to enter the country who were found to have HIV infection were denied entry, quarantined, and then deported (Ministry of Health 1985; Ministry of Health et al. 1988; Ministry of Public Security and Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1986; State Education Commission and Ministry of Health of China 1986; Ministry of Health and Ministry of Public Security 1987; Sun et al. 2010).",

In fact, between 2007 and 2009, foreigners accounted for only 0.3% of all newly identified HIV infections within China.

Those affected were largely poor farmers who sold their blood to support their families. Domestic blood collectors and blood product manufacturers, finding themselves in a market suddenly shielded from international competition because of the ban on importation of foreign blood products, took advantage in the lag in government regulation and oversight of this new and highly lucrative market. Interest in growing profits eclipsed concerns for quality and safety, and the health of donors and recipients was compromised when equipment became contaminated and tens of thousands became infected with HIV. The outbreak became one of the worst tragedies of the global HIV pandemic (Sun et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2007).",

However, the law also emphasized that blood donation must be voluntary, and donors may not be compensated (Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress 1998). Since the enactment of the Blood Donation Law, only a handful cases of HIV infection via blood transfusion have been reported (Sun et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2007). Substantial effort has been made to develop standards and quality assurance programs to ensure the safety of the nation\u2019s blood supply. This has included improved testing methods to ensure that even a \u201cwindow-period\u201d donation (i.e. donation from an individual who is in the window period of infection when it is still undetectable by traditional antibody-based serological tests) is caught and removed before it enters the blood supply (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_6 for more information).",

The decision was made to move forward with formulation of policies supporting these measures and endorsing small pilot studies of harm reduction interventions. The result was that harm reduction strategies were included in China\u2019s First Five-Year Action Plan for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2001\u20132005; State Council 2001; Sun et al. 2010).",

Most importantly, it caused a dramatic increase in ART coverage for PLWH. Led by the National Free ART Program (NFATP) and facilitated by a massive support program called China CARES, the number of PLWH on ART in 2003 was only roughly about 100, but by 2005, this number had increased to 20,000 and by 2007, to 34,000 (Ma et al. 2018). ART scale-up had a major impact on HIV/AIDS-related mortality (Zhang et al. 2009), and as evidence of the benefits of ART accumulated, requirements restricting ART eligibility were relaxed and greater and greater proportions of PLWH who were diagnosed were receiving treatment (Ma et al. 2018). Additionally, HIV testing overall increased, and the number of pregnant women screened for HIV and provided PMTCT services increased dramatically. All children orphaned by AIDS were taken in by relatives, neighbors, or local government-run social welfare programs. Moreover, although not a primary objective of the policy, stigma and discrimination appeared to be positively impacted in the wake of the \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d policy, particularly in areas where the epidemic was driven by contaminated plasma collection (Cao et al. 2006) (see Chaps. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_13, 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_25, and 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_28 for more information).",

However, it importantly was the first piece of legislation in China that dealt with the protections of the rights of PLWH. Stigma associated with HIV/AIDS has been very severe in China since the beginning of the epidemic. PLWH and their family members, neighbors, or friends have been discriminated against due to their medical diagnosis or their association with someone with an HIV diagnosis. Discrimination resulting from stigmatizing attitudes has been particularly severe in the workplace and in healthcare settings. This policy clearly set out, specifically, the right to marry, the right to access healthcare services, the right to equal employment opportunities, and the right to receive an education for all PLWH. The primary aim of the regulations was to address stigma and discrimination against PLWH and to create legal protection for politically sensitive prevention measures, particularly harm reduction interventions including MMT, needle and syringe exchange, and condom use promotion. It furthermore described consequences for failure to implement HIV/AIDS-related policy. However, implementation and enforcement of this regulation has been inconsistent across geographies, levels of government, and sectors within the government (Sun et al. 2010). Nevertheless, this was a very important piece of legislation that again marked a turning point in China\u2019s HIV response (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_28 for more information).",

The plan set more specific and ambitious targets, particularly for prevention programs for marginalized, high-risk groups, such as PWID, FSW, MSM, and migrant workers. It also contained targets for harm reduction programs. For example, one target was to establish MMT clinics in all counties and cities with more than 500 registered drug users, and for MMT coverage to reach at least 70% of registered opioid users. This explicit target, and the funding associated with it, was instrumental in the successful scale-up the MMT program. Finally, the plan also contained targets related to treatment including ART coverage of at least 80% for AIDS patients by 2010 and PMTCT coverage of more than 90% for pregnant women living with HIV by 2010 (Sun et al. 2010).",

Additionally, while the epidemic remained concentrated geographically and among key populations, new high-risk groups were being affected (e.g., MSM, migrants, serodiscordant couples) and more people were progressing to AIDS. China\u2019s HIV epidemic was becoming more dynamic and more complex. Thus, when it came time to draft the third plan for 2011\u20132015, policymakers had realized that the HIV response required renewed vigor and new measures that would increase the efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, in the 12th Five-Year Action Plan for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2011\u20132015; called the 12th instead of the third to align with the national planning cycle), policymakers took a new direction, and for the first time, civil society was included as an important partner in the HIV response. The new plan heavily emphasized the need to support the involvement of organizations outside the government, such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs), in HIV prevention and care. This was groundbreaking and added much needed additional capacity for implementation of interventions. Additional key components of the plan included strengthening the prevention and control capacity of local administrative levels and further expanding coverage of prevention and care services (State Council 2012).",

It had also examined loss to follow-up along the continuum (Gu et al. 2016) and found that creating a simplified and streamlined patient pathway, known as the \u201cOne4All\u201d strategy, from screening HIV-reactive to receiving a confirmed diagnosis to being initiated on ART, regardless of CD4 count, had important clinical benefits including a dramatic reduction in all-cause mortality (Wu et al. 2015, 2017).",

Consistent condom use, one of the most effective and affordable prevention measures available, is still low both among heterosexual couples and homosexual couples as well as in the context of extramarital noncommercial and commercial sexual contact. Harm reduction measures still do not cover all those in need of services, and retention is persistently poor. Testing uptake even among those who are aware and knowledgeable, educated, and financially stable is suboptimal\u2014many do not access testing frequently enough, and many more have never tested. HIV VCT services are slow, PITC services are poorly targeted and routinely identify infection too late, and self-testing, which could be very promising for reaching those who choose not to access facility-based or government-run testing services, suffers from a lack of regulation, quality assurance, and linkage to care mechanisms. Enormous numbers of PLWH who screen HIV-reactive or are diagnosed with HIV infection are lost to follow-up before they start treatment due to fragmented services, long wait times, complicated procedures, and difficulty in navigating a complex health system. Those who do successfully start treatment struggle with follow-up and adherence to medications and often do not achieve the all-important treatment goal of viral suppression. Furthermore, treatment for coinfections such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis is not integrated into HIV services. Together, these factors contribute to high mortality and morbidity even among China\u2019s treated PLWH.",
