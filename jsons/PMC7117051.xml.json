This new disease, given the name Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), inspired a major response from the international public health community, as well as from the local governments affected. Although the transmission of SARS was successfully halted in only a few months, it was initially uncertain whether the disease would be controlled, and from the outset SARS was identified and responded to as an exemplary problem of \u2018emerging infectious disease\u2019 to be addressed in a globalized context where medicine, national and international public health, politics and commerce interconnect.",

In this paper, we examine the cultural framing of SARS in print newspapers in the UK, focusing on metaphors as cultural and linguistic tools for conceptualising disease. We argue that the framing of SARS through narratives, metaphors, clich\u00e9s and analogical matrices shows a significant difference from recognised and studied cultural frameworks for interpreting epidemic diseases that have been largely derived with reference to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Most strikingly, coverage of SARS avoided the use of war and plague metaphors, which normally dominate \u2018control of disease\u2019 discourse, instead relying on a combination of killer and control metaphors. This article tries to establish whether the new medical and political configuration of disease features that characterised SARS contributed to new cultural patterns in the reporting of this disease (see Fox & Swazey, 2004).",

(2003, 31 Dec)) initiating an international alert through its new Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN), sending in teams to assist local public health services, and organising an international scientific effort to learn about the new disease\u2014which rapidly identified a coronavirus as the biological agent responsible. The vast majority of the 8096 cases and 774 deaths from SARS were in China, but the disease spread to a number of other locations, notably Toronto (251 cases), Singapore (238 cases) and Taiwan (346 cases). After a period of rapid diffusion, outbreaks were contained through a combination of surveillance, quarantine methods and travel bans, beginning with Vietnam (where the end of local transmission was declared on 28 April). Case numbers peaked in May 2003. By 5 July, the last paths of transmission had been broken, and only a small number of individuals were still recovering from the disease.",

This interest in metaphor illustrates the impact of the \u2018linguistic turn\u2019, the emergence of \u2018cognitive linguistics\u2019 (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Turner, 2001), and the influence of critics, notably Susan Sontag, who have emphasised the interdependence of language and stigma in disease since the 1970s. Perhaps the most significant factor, however, is the character of the AIDS epidemic, by far the most widely discussed disease in social and cultural studies. The attention given to the cultural and linguistic framing of AIDS has been a direct response to the stigmatisation faced by those infected, and to the heated debates over the disease in the 1980s and 1990s. The significance of metaphor within this process has been widely analysed with some striking results, for example showing that negative AIDS metaphors can be correlated with the outcome of AIDS-related litigation in the US (Drass, Gregware, & Musheno, 1997; Rollins, 2002).",

Moreover, to a unique extent, the AIDS epidemic has been marked by the active contestation of language and metaphor. By 1992, Paula Treichler could state that \u2018AIDS metaphors are now routinely compared and critiqued to refine their effectiveness and usefulness\u2019 (Treichler, 1992: 87. See: Brandt, 1988; Gilmore & Somerville, 1994; Norton, Schwartzbaum, & Wheat, 1990; Hughey, Norton, & Sullivan-Norton, 1989; Gilmore & Somerville, 1994: 1351\u20131352; Sandahl, 2001). As a result, AIDS metaphors and language possess a fluid, overtly politicised character largely absent from other diseases, where metaphors tend to be more entrenched and less controversial (Sherwin, 2001: 346).",

            "text": "Alongside this work on HIV/AIDS, a broader critique of language in medicine, especially the reliance on particular dominant conceptual metaphors, has developed. Military metaphors have become a particular target in the two decades since they were powerfully anatomised by the critic and writer Susan Sontag (1978), Sontag (1989) in her essays on cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS (Annas, 1995; Patton, 1990: 59\u201360; Montgomery, 1991; Arrigo, 1999; Worboys, 2000; Gradmann, 2000, see also Clow, 2001). During this time, military metaphors have remained abundant. Even the \u2018war on cancer\u2019 that the American president Richard Nixon declared in the 1970s continues (Cox News Service, 2002; Lerner, 2003). Yet, such militaristic metaphors have drawbacks. Among sufferers, they promote shame and guilt (Sontag, 1978). Among policymakers and public health officials, \u2018[m]ilitary thinking concentrates on the physical, sees control as central, and encourages the expenditure of massive resources to achieve dominance\u2019 (Annas, 1995: 746). They can even arguably make it easier to \u2018sacrifice people and their rights\u2019 (Ross, 1986: 18). The consequences of this type of discourse can also be seen in comparable non-medical contexts, such as the disastrous UK response to the foot and mouth epidemic in 2001 (Nerlich, 2004). One result of these concerns about military metaphors has been a series of calls to replace them with more attractive alternative metaphors. Annas proposes an \u2018ecological framework\u2019; Sontag suggests a more absolute stripping away of metaphor altogether. What Sherwin described as \u2018choosing politically liberating metaphors\u2019 has become a widespread and urgent concern (Sherwin, 2001: 343; Treichler, 1992).",

Largely arriving on the back of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is oriented towards the rich and controversial language usages elicited by that disease. AIDS\u2019 predominance in studies of metaphor is by no means exclusive: cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis and cholera have all been closely studied, if largely from patient narratives (Seale, 2001; Nations & Monte, 1996; Weiss, 1997; Gibbs & Franks, 2002). Yet little attention has been given to the wider social framing of diseases which have not attracted dramatic metaphorisation, particularly fast-moving, new infectious diseases, such as SARS. Only a few studies have emerged on Ebola, SARS and similar diseases (Unger, 1998; Washer, 2004). Sontag's suggestion that \u2018diseases understood to be simply epidemic have become less useful as metaphors\u2019 (1989: 72, emphasis added) may explain the neglect of such diseases by some researchers. However, given the narrow empirical basis of current arguments about language and policy, it is important to examine what effects metaphors have had in framing such diseases, and whether they present the same problems identified in HIV/AIDS or in broader critiques of militarism within medicine.",

Instead, the qualitative method standard in linguistic metaphor studies was used, with adaptations to deal with the size of the corpus. This was based on two complete readings of the total corpus by separate researchers. On the first reading, qualitative research software was used to mark-up metaphors and repetitive tropes and outline a map of linguistic patterns and frequency. The second read through took the form of a structured reading of articles, with pieces from all newspapers read in sequence in seven-day blocs to establish chronological patterns and linguistic developments through the development of the corpus.",

Newspapers equivocated between presenting SARS as a major danger and dismissing it as a panic. Conscious and unconscious issues of language choice ran throughout this. The rumbling debate about the significance of SARS in part took the form of constant questioning about the appropriate epidemiological terminology for the outbreak: was it an epidemic, a pandemic, or neither?

There was, for example, political debate about whether SARS should be a notifiable disease. But there was no equivalent to the heat of the vaccination versus slaughter debate of the FMD epidemic, despite some controversy in Toronto. It is significant that Vietnam had a major early success in controlling the epidemic using a quarantine-based approach. Indeed, conflict of any kind was limited: pressure groups were largely absent; there was no significant scientific debate about SARS in the public sphere, with few rival theories in the West to challenge the WHO laboratory network's conclusions.

The less moralistic concept of SARS as a \u2018superbug\u2019, \u2018super-disease\u2019, or \u2018superflu\u2019 occasionally featured in the tabloids, drawing on comparable images of disturbed nature (such as superweeds in the GM debate: Nerlich, Clarke, & Dingwall, 2000) to convey its seriousness, while locating SARS within another new pathological genre: the superbug, such as MRSA. Similar news values can also be recognised in the common early description of SARS as \u2018jet bug\u2019, a device which brings SARS nearer and ties it to affluence rather than foreign poverty; it was suggested initially by the WHO relating SARS\u2019 spread to international flights. Comparable concerns about news value are manifest in the use of mystery metaphors (mysterious pneumonia\u2019, \u2018elusive virus\u2019, or \u2018mystery bug\u2019), particularly in early broadsheet reports. Newspapers also used various common natural disaster metaphors to interpret SARS's progress on a global or regional scale. The most ubiquitous was SARS IS A FIRE (\u2018burns out\u2019). Others included earthquakes (\u2018the disease's epicentre\u2019), and, more rarely, volcanoes (SARS \u2018erupted\u2019) and storms (\u2018eye of SARS storm\u2019). SARS was thus linked to historical images of the stalking mysterious killer, to exemplars of modernity, the jet-set age and globalisation, and to generic natural disasters. Strikingly, as with SARS IS A KILLER, all these metaphors were used in such a way that SARS was represented as a unified entity.",

This can be seen in the changes to the framing of responsibility that occurred when the disease seemed closer. The dominant Killer metaphor gave SARS an \u2018active\u2019 role. It was a free agent responsible for its actions; those it infects were passive, blameless victims. This pattern of responsibility differs from the emphasis on individual culpability apparent in the blame and stigma linked with AIDS, syphilis and some other diseases. However, where people infected with SARS threatened to bring the disease into the country an alternative metaphor system\u2014DISEASE IS A POSSESSION\u2014was often used, particularly in the tabloid press. In this metaphorical schema, people catch, carry, pick up, get, have, bring, acquire or contract disease, which is a burden they have got, and can give or pass on to others, unless they are relieved of it or have it taken away. It emphasises individual culpability in disease. In the SARS coverage, it blended with similarly valenced grammatical forms, in which the sick person became the active agent in their illness (person X becomes or falls ill; is or becomes infected with or by Y). A good example is The Daily Mail report on the \u2018First Briton to get \u2018flu\u2019 killer bug in the UK\u2019: a person who \u2018contracts\u2019 SARS, and \u2018becomes infected\u2019, although the virus remains a \u2018killer\u2019 (14/4/03).

Without knowledge of its origins, and with doubts about events in China, SARS had borders but no obvious middle for much of March and April. It was from the outset a disease of many places.

On 29 April, for example, the Chinese Prime Minister announced measures to have SARS \u2018brought under control\u2019. Framing responses to SARS in a discourse of bureaucratic control drew on a long tradition in which public health as \u2018medical police\u2019 is a function of the civil state similar to the other kinds of \u2018policing\u2019 it carries out (Jordanova, 1980; Porter, 1999). Ideas of police ran throughout the limited repertoire of traditional public health techniques used to halt SARS. Quarantines of the infected and their contacts, and surveillance of travellers were the two most important methods used against SARS, with travel bans imposed by some countries.4\nThe relationship to policing was clear: governments promised \u2018to hold victims\u2019, \u2018detain SARS sufferers\u2019, identify \u2018those suspected of harbouring the virus\u2019.

The institutional and national impact of SARS and the responses it elicited were largely framed through a bureaucratic discourse of management and a balance metaphor-dyad of controlled/uncontrolled. Struggle metaphors were also heavily used to describe the human and economic impacts of SARS; a range of other metaphors and analogical frames appeared occasionally. Overall, these metaphors and historical framings were limited, fragmented and somewhat hackneyed. They are a marked contrast to the richness of writing and reporting required to explain more novel scientific, medical or natural events such as clones or invasive species (see Nerlich, Clarke, & Dingwall, 1999; Larson, Nerlich, & Wallis, forthcoming).",

For example, AIDS as sin was employed to describe cause (divine judgement), attitude to sufferer (sinner), and individual and public policy responses (repentance, abstinence, moral education). By contrast, the metaphor system we have described shares some characteristics with patterns identified in coverage of Ebola and other analyses of SARS (Unger, 1998; Washer, 2004). Unger has identified a shift in Ebola coverage from a \u2018mutation-contagion\u2019 package, the content of which includes the story aspects we found most closely related to the Killer metaphor system, to a \u2018containment\u2019 package, which has parallels to the bureaucratic control discourse we discuss. However, where Unger and Washer interpret this as a single news discourse that frightens then reassures, we find that the two metaphor systems co-exist in parallel, serving quite separate needs and prompted by different sources and intentions (see also Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002).",

In this case, the conflict is clear, but is the result of the structural context rather than psychology. The existence of different metaphor systems used in the description of specific aspects of SARS can be understood as intimately related to tensions between public concerns and anxieties surrounding the disease entity, the habitual pressures on the media to convey the news values of stories, and the limits on political and public health options and governments\u2019 willingness to act. Several aspects of this relationship are particularly clear from the analysis above. News values are most obvious in the prominence of the \u2018SARS Killer\u2019 metaphor system and the alternate disaster metaphors, and in the striking shift to DISEASE IS A POSSESSION metaphors when SARS seemed most threatening. More suggestive and surprising is the media's avoidance of overt marginalisation, where feedback from AIDS coverage may be having an effect. The relationship between governmental responses and the media coverage is at one level more direct, as is apparent from journalist's reiteration of bureaucratic control metaphors employed initially in government and WHO briefings. However, it also may be fundamentally related to the striking lack of militaristic metaphors. This seems to contradict research into the use of \u2018media templates\u2019 or the use of standard narrative and metaphorical conventions that structure the media reporting of medical issues (see Kitzinger, 2000; Miller, Kitzinger, Williams, & Beharrell, 1998; Seale, 2003) and therefore needs some explanation.",

The immediate context of war in Iraq may have played a part in this, pushing commentators to create distinctive discursive systems for the two stories. However, three aspects of the development of SARS as a political issue made it particularly unsuitable for framing as a war. First, the international response to SARS lacked a \u2018general\u2019 as SARS\u2019 rapid transmission to several countries meant it was not \u2018owned\u2019 by any single originating nation. The closest thing to a leader was the WHO. However, it faced tight limits as an advisory and coordinating institution, and the difficulties it experienced in negotiating access to China made it essential for it to avoid claiming authority over affected countries. Consistently, the WHO presented itself as \u2018working with\u2019 or \u2018supporting\u2019 national authorities in a \u2018collaborative effort\u2019 and \u2018partnership\u2019. This also meant that there was no point at which war on SARS was declared. Second, in the UK, SARS was largely a distant, international story. The UK government needed to avoid panic, not call on national solidarity or quash dissent\u2014both areas where militaristic metaphors can help. Third, the effort against SARS did not promise to end in a clear victory. Framing SARS as a problem of control reflected a general uncertainty which AIDS has fostered about the effect that governments can have on epidemic diseases. The aspiration to contain, rather than eradicate, SARS, lacks the optimism of the war on cancer of the 1960s and 1970s.",

SARS highlights the role of international organisations in driving news agendas on some kinds of international issues. In the current geopolitical situation, few if any such institutions can claim a genuine directorial role or possess any significant resources of their own, in the manner of national governments. They function as advisory, regulatory, coordinating bodies, and rely on the unenforceable goodwill of national governments to achieve their goals. This in turn affects the metaphorical framing of international \u2018problems\u2019 and induces the bureaucratic, managerial approach which can be seen in the SARS discourse in place of more energetic war metaphor systems. Understanding this shift in metaphorical framing, away from the well-entrenched metaphor system of war and plague, might not only signal a shift in the perception and policing of an emergent disease, but can also contribute to an emerging shift in the theorising of metaphor itself, away from seeing it purely as a rhetorical or cognitive device towards seeing it as a cultural and political one. As Bono has suggested: \u2018such cultural [scientific] metaphors adapt themselves to a larger ecology of contesting social and cultural values, interests and ideologies\u2019 (1990: 81).",
