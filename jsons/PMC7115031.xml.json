Hence, the term \u201cnot connecting the dots\u201d is often used to describe these phenomena. This brings to the forefront the problem of predicting the occurrence of epidemical crises. More important is the issue of identifying (and not ignoring) anomalies.",

Nevertheless, the fact that an epidemical crisis is somewhat predictable does not completely reduce the amount of surprise that accompany the actual occurrence of the crisis. Hence, any mitigation plan, that is, a set of procedures compiled in order to address the adverse effects of epidemical crises, should be flexible enough to handle additional surprises related to secondary adverse effects of the epidemical crisis. Finally, the real time ramification program is the actual set of procedures enacted and executed as the epidemical crisis occurs. There are two preconditions for successful remedy of epidemical crisis affects. First, the authorities/leadership have to attempt following the original mitigation plan as close as possible while instilling a sense of trust and calmness in the people that experience the crisis and the mitigation provider teams. Second, and as a part of their leadership traits, the authorities must possess the ability to adapt their remedy procedures to the dynamics of the epidemical crisis, potentially providing effective improvisations aimed at handling secondary disastrous events that evolve from the main disaster. A simple example for such events is looting and violence that might accompany a major disaster. For this end, fast automatic assessment of the dynamics is paramount.",

Often, due to the panic that accompanies outbreaks there is an explosion of data which is characterized by large amount of information and high \u201cvelocity\u201d and higher derivatives of velocity of information spread. Using the current terminology to describe the phenomenon: pandemic news are likely to become viral. Notably, many countries would try to completely ban, control, or limit, the news spread. But experience show that these attempts are not likely to be fruitful: citizens of these countries can still find numerous ways to spread the information through social networks. Hence, data mining in electronic versions of newspapers and related media as well as in social networks is an important cyber warfare ammunition. In addition, it is well known (but not published) that many national security agencies are digitizing \u201chard forms\u201d of publicly available information of other countries such as newspapers. These might be related to official, semi-official, or private media-outlets. This media, however, is easier to control by a country that is trying to conceal an epidemical outbreak. One interesting pattern in this situation is the appearance of a few news reports at the beginning of the outbreak, followed by acceleration in reports, followed by a complete seizure of these reports due to a discovery of the news by the country\u2019s leaders, followed by a complete ban on this news.",

The fundamental algorithms applied to weighted graphs are: (1) finding the shortest path between vertices, (2) finding the minimum spanning tree, (3) identifying maximal cliques, (4) finding the minimal Euler tour/cycle and (5) finding the minimal Hamiltonian tour/cycle. In this context, short, max and min might relate to the number of vertices/edges or the sum of weights of the relevant vertices/edges.",

Hence, many of the algorithms applied to weighted graphs might be of interest when fuzzy graph and their semantics are considered. Moreover, without loss of generality, we can assume that weights represented by real numbers are normalized to the range of [0, 1]. In this case the vertices and/or the edges can be represented via a complex number representing the degree of membership of the vertex/edge in the graph. Clearly, a non-weighted fuzzy graph is a special case of a \u201cregular\u201d fuzzy graph. Fuzzy graphs were used in neuro-fuzzy models of information propagation and aggregation, including opinion formation [37, 39]. In the next section we provide important definitions related to complex fuzzy graphs.",

Note that the use of complex fuzzy logic is a very strong \u201ctool\u201d that enables dealing with the edges/vertices as carrying complex fuzzy membership values. Hence, it enables exploiting the features of complex fuzzy set theory, complex fuzzy set theory, and complex fuzzy inference. In general, one can use the two components of the complex number assigned to vertices/edges as denoting complex fuzzy information. Alternatively one can use on of the two components as a real fuzzy value and the second component as a weight. To illustrate we provide the following example.",

Other terms related to complex fuzzy graphs are complete graphs, planner graphs and simple graphs, sub graphs, spanning sub-graphs, cliques, paths, cycles, tours, Euler tours, Euler cycles, Hamiltonian tours, Hamiltonian cycles, forests, and trees. The fundamental algorithms applied to complex fuzzy graphs are: (1) finding the shortest path between vertices, (2) finding the minimum spanning tree, (3) identifying maximal cliques, (4) finding the minimal Euler tour/cycle, and (5) finding the minimal Hamiltonian tour/cycle. In this context, short, max and min, might relate to the number of vertices/edges or the sum of weights of the relevant vertices/edges. These terms and algorithms are derived from their definitions in the context of non-fuzzy graphs [2] and fuzzy graphs [22]. We are currently working on the extension of these algorithms to complex fuzzy graphs. One interesting and relevant example is finding the maximal complex fuzzy clique in a complex fuzzy graph. In this example, we expand the work reported in [22] and use a neuro-fuzzy system as a \u201ctool\u201d for addressing the problem.",

Fuzzy clustering (e.g., the Fuzzy C-means) enables patterns to become members of more than one cluster. Additionally, it enables maintaining clusters that represent outliers through low degree of membership. These clusters would be discarded in clustering of hard (vs. Fuzzy) data. Incremental and dynamic clustering (e.g., the incremental Fuzzy ISODATA) enable the clusters\u2019 structures to change as information is accumulated. Again, this is a strong mechanism for enabling identification of unlikely events without premature discarding of these events. The clustering can be performed in a traditional feature space composed of numerical measurements of feature values. Alternatively, the clustering can be performed in a multidimensional Fuzzy logic space where the features represent values of linguistic variables The combination of powerful classification capability, adaptive and dynamic mechanisms, as well as the capability to consider uncertain data, maintain data with low likelihood of occurrence, and use a combination of numerical and linguistic values makes this tool, one of the most promising tools for predicting epidemical crisis outbreaks. We currently conduct research on dynamic and incremental fuzzy clustering and it is evident that the methodology can serve as a highly efficient tool for identifying outliers.
