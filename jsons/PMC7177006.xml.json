            "text": "With recent advances in genome-wide sequencing, studies of the function of individual proteins and protein complexes have become increasingly important for understanding biological functions, and for selection of novel targets for drug discovery applications. The yeast two-hybrid system was originally developed to identify and study protein-protein interactions (1,2). This method was later expanded to allow detection of interactions between proteins and RNA (3), proteins and nonprotein ligands (4), proteins and peptides (5), proteins and multiple partners (6,7), and whole-genome applications (8\u201310). In addition, some investigators have begun to study the potential of two-hybrid screens to detect protein-small-molecule interactions (11\u201313). However, limited progress has so far been made to adapt such yeast screening technologies for the identification of new clinical candidates in high-throughput screens (HTSs).",

Permeabilizing agents, such as polymyxin B sulfate and polymyxin B nonapeptide, have been used to physically disrupt the integrity of yeast membranes (14). However, use of such chemical agents in drug screening is not ideal, because of the toxicity induced by polymyxin B treatment.",

            "text": "As an alternative strategy, a number of yeast genes involved in the control of membrane permeability have been identified, which might be targeted to improve strain permeability (15). In particular, a network of regulators associated with the phenotype known as pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR), which closely resembles the mammalian multi-drug resistance phenotype (MDR) (16), is known to affect cellular transport and drug resistance. Pdrlp and Pdr3p, members of the C6 zinc cluster family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, redundantly modulate expression of ABC transporter proteins by inducing their transcription (17,18). Disruption of PDRI and PDR3, the genes encoding Pdrlp and Pdr3p, respectively, results in decreased expression of the ABC transporter PDR5, and thereby increases drug sensitivity of pdr1\n\u2212\npdr3\n\u2212 cells (19). Further, it has been shown that overexpression of either the HXT9p or HXT11p hexose transporter proteins independently promotes drug sensitivity, by increasing uptake of certain drugs (19,20). Based on these earlier studies, we have exploited these properties of PDR and HXT mutants to create hyperpermeable yeast strains useful for HTS for the two-hybrid system. We here describe the creation of these strains and their utilization for the selection of small-molecule inhibitors of interaction between Ras and Raf oncoproteins.",

The goal of this transformation was to replace the URA3 gene at the PDR3 locus in the chromosome of SKY49 and SKY192 with a galactose-inducible copy of HXT11. To this end, plasmid pHisHXT11-Int was digested with AatII and PshAI, and the hisG-HXT11-Int cassette was purified and transformed into SKY49 and SKY192. To select yeast with the hisG-HXT11-Int cassette integrated into the chromosome, cells were propagated on YPD plates for 5\u20136 h to decrease the amount of Ura3p enzyme, and then replica-plated on plates containing minimal DO media containing 1.5 mg/mL 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5FOA) and uracil at a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL (see\nNote 3). Yeast that express the URA3 gene convert 5FOA to a toxic metabolite and die. However, cells that have replaced the URA3 gene with HXT11 grow normally. Several hundred transformants containing the HXT11 gene at the PDR3 chromosomal locus were obtained. Two strains containing the inserted cassettes (Fig. 2\nC) were selected, and named SKY51 and SKY194.",

Both parental SKY191 and modified SKY197 strains showed no sensitivity to SMM at all concentrations tested. However, based on the size of the death zones, SKY197 is significantly more sensitive to CYH and 4-NQO than SKY191 on YPD media (Fig. 6). Further, when the SKY197 yeast were incubated on Gal/Raff-containing media (thereby inducing expression of HXT9 and HXT11 genes), their sensitivity to CYH and 4-NQO increased. The estimated increase of death-zone diameters for 4-NQO for SKY197 on YPG/R media in comparison with the parental strains grown on the same media was approx 32\u201340%. After 48 h of incubation on YPG/R media, sensitivity to CYH was estimated to be 0.01 \u00b5g/mL minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in comparison to 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for the parental strain. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration (micrograms per milliliter of broth) that inhibited visible growth, disregarding a haze of barely visible growth. Sensitivity to CYH of a yeast strain harboring PDR1 and PDR3 deletions, and with the HXT11 gene overexpressed from a multicopy plasmid, was previously reported as having an MIC of 0.03 \u00b5g/mL CYH (19). Thus, integrating inducible copies of HXT11 and HXT9 into the chromosome while deleting pdr1 and pdr3 significantly increased the sensitivity of yeast cells to the tested compounds (see\nNote 4).\n\n",

The specific DNAs we have used can be successfully replaced in integration cassettes by other DNA sequences that have no or low homology to yeast genomic DNA.\nGAL1 was chosen as a promoter because of its strength and inducible nature. Further, comparison of the yeast sensitivity to the given compound on media supplemented with glucose (YPD) vs galactose (YPG) allows unequivocal estimation of the contribution of the HXT9 gene to the reduction of resistance phenotype.We found that the Ura3p enzyme synthesized from the first integration cassette is present in the yeast cells at the time of addition of 5FOA compound even in the cells with a successful second cassette integration and elimination of an active copy of URA3 gene. The activity of these remnants of Ura3p causes the conversion of 5FOA into a toxic metabolite, and subsequent cell death. Additional propagation of the yeast on the YPD media, rich in exogenous uracil, is sufficient to significantly reduce the level of the earlier synthesized Ura3p enzyme in the cells with successful recombinations, and escape from 5FOA-related toxicity.The absence of improved sensitivity to SMM and Zeo in the modified SKY197 strain indicates that the enhancement of permeability is not universal, but limited to some compound classes, likely reflecting differences in the uptake and efflux mechanisms for different drugs.\n",
