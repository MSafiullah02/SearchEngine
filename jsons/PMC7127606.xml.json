            "text": "Various techniques as fluorescent [1], surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy [2], quartz crystal microbalance [3] and electrochemical methods [4] have been proposed for DNA hybridization detection. Electrochemical methods for DNA hybridization detection possess the advantage of simplicity, low cost, high sensitivity [5], [6], [7] and rapid and direct detection [8] of specific DNA sequences. A variety of alternative ways of electrochemically detecting DNA have been reported in the literature in the last years. Direct, indirect methods and the use of marks are the three formats which have been employed in the genosensors development. The intrinsic electroactivity of guanine or adenine bases can be used for the direct measurement of nucleic acids in a label-free assay [9], [10], but their poor sensitivity is their principal disadvantage. The electroactive determination of intercalate [11] or associate with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) indicators involves the indirect methods of DNA determination. The bad sensitivity can be enhancing with the use of enzymes due to their inherent amplification. Finally, the use of marks, as fluorescent molecules [12], has been very used in the DNA sensors development. However, the use of electroactive species has been much less common [13], [14].",

            "text": "Methylene blue (MB), 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)phenothiazine-5-ium-chloride, an organic dye which belongs to the phenothiazine family, had been used as electroactive marker in biosensors to detect the hybridization event [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. The process is performed by different interactions: (i) by electrostatic interaction between cationic MB and anionic DNA [19], [20], [21], (ii) by intercalation of MB in the DNA double helix between alternating G\u2013C base sequences [22], [23], [24], [25] and (iii) by covalent bound to the end of the single-stranded target DNA (ssDNA) [26], [27], [28], the least exploited of all. The first reference of a covalently modified MB-DNA is due to Plaxco et al. [26]. This work supports the utility of a DNA sensor with MB conjugated to the 3\u2032 end of the DNA as probe sequence as a rapid, specific, and convenient method for the detection of DNA and RNA sequences. In this case, alternating current voltammetry (ACV) was employed for recording the electrochemical process. They found that signal generation on gold disk electrode is coupled to a hybridization-linked conformational change, rather than to only adsorption on the sensor surface. The covalent attachment presents, among others, the advantage that it is not necessary to perform a subsequent step of washing to remove unbound label. The use of ferrocene and their derivates [29], [30], [31], [32], gold complexes [13], metallic [33] or semiconductor [34] nanoparticles and osmium [35] or platinum [14] complexes covalently attachment to DNA strand had been used in the detection of the hybridization event.",

Several reviews of CNTs regarding the methods of synthesis [40], [41] and their mechanical, chemical and electrical properties [40], [42], [43], [44] are reported in the literature. Since their discovery and due to their unique properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used in different electroanalytical applications [45], [46], [47]. Their adsorption capacity, the possibility of being functionalized, their ability to promote the electron transfer reactions of a great number of molecules [48], [49] and the possibility of use in miniaturized devices make CNTs a very attractive material for the further development of electrochemical biosensors. Different attempts have been made to improve the electroanalytical properties of disposable CNT-SPEs (screen-printed electrodes) biosensors, through their adsorption properties and the improvement in the reversibility of processes [50], [51].",

This can be explained because although the label is also MB, conjugation to DNA decreases the diffusion coefficient and therefore the peak intensities [57], [58]. On the other hand, the electrode surface can be reduced by the presence of DNA strands, decreasing then the effective area for the electron transfer. An increase in the signal is obtained for those strands with two MB molecules (MB-DNA-MB, 15 and 30-mer) attached at both ends, when compared to the respective MB-DNA of the same length. Although all the strands have the same concentration, this of MB doubles and can be an adequate approach for increasing the signals. Slightly higher values are obtained for 30-mer strands. The SWV intensities obtained were \u22126 \u00b1 1 and \u221210 \u00b1 2 \u03bcA for MB conjugated 15 and 30-mer respectively. These became \u221215.5 \u00b1 0.1 and \u221221.6 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcA for the corresponding doubly conjugated 15 and 30-mer strands.

The highest value was obtained for the 30-mer sequence with two MB molecules (\u2212103.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcA), meanwhile the lowest intensity was for the shortest sequence with one MB (\u22127 \u00b1 1 \u03bcA (MB-DNA, 15-mer)).

Surprisingly, it can be seen that over bare electrodes, no adsorption process is observed. It is known that there is a critical effect of the size of the oligonucleotide on the adsorption at solid electrodes that may explain this. Oligonucleotide size directly affects the adsorption process [59], so that easier adsorption of smaller molecules is produced.
