Shoebills and hamerkops are included under current classifications. These birds are long-lived (40 years for captive pelicans, 30 years for free-ranging frigate birds). All feed on fish, aquatic vertebrates, and invertebrates. Monogamous mating is typical. Apart from tropicbirds, eggs are incubated using foot webs, limiting clutch size to one or two eggs. Neonates are altricial. Gannets, boobies, frigate birds, and tropicbirds are pelagic, spending much of the nonbreeding season in extended flight. Most pelicans are surface feeders, while cormorants, shags, and anhingas are subsurface diving specialists. Brown pelicans, tropicbirds, gannets, and boobies are plunge divers.

There is considerable size variation between the smallest storm petrels (adults 20 g) to the albatrosses (adults exceeding 10 kg). They are long lived: up to 20 years for the smaller petrels, 50\u201370 years for albatrosses. All Procellariiformes are pelagic, accomplished long-distance soaring fliers that spend months at sea feeding on fish, larger invertebrates, phytoplankton, and krill. Landfall is infrequent and occurs mainly for breeding and nesting. This is typically colonial on remote islands, on the ground or in burrows. Young are altricial to semialtricial with well-developed thermoregulatory capacity. Introduced predators, island habitat destruction, and intensive fishing pose threats. Many species, particularly albatross, are threatened or at risk of extinction.",

Prior to molt, penguins gain more than 25% of their body weight, which is then lost again during the process. This is pertinent to body condition scoring.

Skeletal pneumatization varies. Among diving species, anhingas have apneumatic postcranial skeletons, and cormorants are heavy-boned with pneumatization of only the humeri or caudal cervical vertebrae. In contrast, pelicans, being soaring fliers, have extensive skeletal pneumaticity, except for the femur. In pelicans, gannets and boobies, diverticula extend from the air sacs to form a substantial cranioventral subcutaneous air cushion system, which should not be misdiagnosed as pathological subcutaneous emphysema (Fig. 27.2\n). This anatomical feature is thought to provide cushioning for water entry during diving from height. As a diving adaptation, many Pelecaniformes have reduced (e.g., frigatebirds, pelicans) or obliterated (e.g., gannets, anhingas) external nostrils, and breathing (and access to the olfactory system) are via the open mouth or jugal operculum at the commissure of the bill (e.g., boobies, cormorants). Male frigatebirds have neck skin pouches with bare overlying skin that is inflated for display.",

Poor parental care or miscalculation of the mineral formulation may result in nutritional metabolic bone disease. Affected chicks fail to thrive and develop folding fractures of the tibiotarsus, rib fractures, and luxation of the gastrocnemius tendon. Radiographic reduction in bone density is apparent. There are occasional reports of rickets in zoo-captive double-crested cormorant chicks and fibrous osteodystrophy in free-ranging royal northern albatross chicks receiving supplemental hand-feeding on their nests. Deterioration of fat soluble vitamin D during frozen storage, feeding of fillets rather than whole fish, and peroxidation of stomach oil used as a supplement were contributing factors. In penguins, histologic findings include marked diffuse osteopenia predominantly affecting long bones (thin, irregular trabeculae, closely-spaced reversal lines, thin surface seams of osteoid) (Adkesson and Langan, 2007). Osteopenia and fibrous osteodystrophy predominate in the other species, with rachitic elongation and widening of the metaphyseal cartilage in cormorants.

Free-ranging Procellariiformes, including shearwaters and prions of all ages, frequently suffer mass mortality events (\u201cwrecks\u201d) of hundreds to thousands of birds. These events occur predominantly during migration and are related to adverse weather and/or inadequate food. Most affected birds are emaciated juveniles with reduced bodyweight compared to birds surviving migration, pectoral muscle atrophy, an empty stomach, complete fat exhaustion with serous atrophy, and multiorgan atrophy. Investigations exclude infectious disease, heavy metals, or persistent organic pollutants but sepsis and dehydration sometimes play a role. Mass downing of migrating, free-ranging eared grebes is seen periodically during the fall in North America; affected birds are typically adult birds in good body condition (Roberts et al., 2014). Events are associated with adverse weather or poor visibility. This species requires water for landing and take-off; downed birds may die on impact or remain trapped on the ground and subsequently die. Winter mortality of free-ranging common loons is seen periodically in Florida (United States) between December and April. Common findings include emaciation with pectoral atrophy, fat exhaustion, and hemorrhagic enteritis. Synergistic etiologies include inadequate food supply, the high energetic cost of migration and molt, poor weather and parasitism. Mass mortalities that sometimes involve thousands of birds also occur from idiopathic emaciation in free-ranging nestling American white pelican breeding colonies. Starvation and hypothermia due to adverse weather are implicated.",

Ingestion of fish is implicated, rather than the carcass-maggot cycle associated with type C botulism in waterfowl.

Elsewhere, pelicans, cormorants, grebes, and occasionally northern fulmar and Laysan albatross have contracted type C botulism.

Progressive paresis and paralysis lead to inability to fly, paddling wing movements across water, and paralysis of the nictitating membranes and the neck (limber neck). Diagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, absence of other causes of paresis/paralysis on gross, and histologic examination (e.g., trauma, inflammation), and laboratory confirmation of botulinum toxin in blood or tissue.

The disease affects both captive and free-ranging penguin populations and is more common in chicks than adults, suggesting adults have acquired immunity or more robust immune function. Increasing prevalence often coincides with weather-induced increases in vector populations but transmission also occurs by direct contact with abraded skin, conjunctiva, mucous membrane, contaminated air-borne particles or infected tissues. At least two divergent Avipoxvirus strains (Chordopoxvirinae subfamily) affect penguins (Offerman et al., 2014). Outbreaks manifest in cutaneous and diphtheric forms. Affected birds are often emaciated. Cutaneous poxvirus infection induces typical raised and ulcerated wart-like papules and nodules in feathered and unfeathered skin around the eyelids, beak, neck, flippers, cloaca, and feet. Glossal lesions may develop. Ocular pathology resulting in blindness occurs in Magellanic penguin chicks (Kane et al., 2012). Histological findings are characteristic, with epidermal hyperplasia and ulceration, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions consistent with Bollinger bodies, and dermatitis. Although cutaneous poxvirus infection is rarely fatal, debilitation and secondary bacterial or fungal infections are common and can cause mortality. The rarer diphtheritic form is more frequently fatal, and manifests as raised, yellow plaques in the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, trachea, and lungs. Infection in these locations can cause dyspnea or dysphagia. The lungs are often congested or hemorrhagic, and there may be spleno- and cardiomegaly. Histological findings include bronchopneumonia, nonsuppurative hepatitis, splenic necrosis, lymphopenia, and lymphocytolysis as well as necrotizing enteritis, esophagitis, and airsacculitis. Typical cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are seen in affected epithelial cells (Fig. 27.13\n). Concurrent infections with common pathogens (e.g. Aspergillus) worsen the clinical course.",

Occasional cormorant fatalities are reported from Europe, where infection is considered enzootic. WNV is shed in respiratory secretions, and since avian to human transmission has been documented, should be treated as a zoonosis. Infection and deaths have been reported in Humboldt and African penguins, common loons, pie-billed grebes, Clark\u2019s grebes, eared grebes, American white and brown pelicans, double-crested, and Guanay cormorants. Major die-offs have occurred in eared grebes and pelicans, and WNV was implicated in at least 11 mortality events resulting in the deaths of over 9000 American white pelicans assessed by the US Geologic Survey, National Wildlife Center prior to 2003. In penguins, clinical signs, when observed, include anorexia, weakness, abnormal behavior, vomiting, and dyspnea from excessive tracheal or pulmonary mucus secretion. No typical gross lesions have been described.

It is rare in free-ranging populations. The causative agent is typically A. fumigatus;A. flavus occurs sporadically. Acute and chronic aspergillosis has been described. Acute cases associated with high spore inoculum and/or severe immunosuppression progress to death within 24\u201348 h. More commonly, aspergillosis has a prolonged course over weeks or months. Predisposing factors in rehabilitation settings and captivity include high environmental spore loads, poor ventilation, high ammonia levels, physiologic, and social stressors, inadequate nutrition, temperature stress, age (see below) and underlying disease. Acute and chronic aspergillosis differ grossly but may occur in the same bird. Acute aspergillosis targets the lungs, which are dark red, edematous, and contain multiple, small, white to tan disseminated foci on serosal and parenchymal cut surfaces. The more common chronic presentations are disseminated and incite variably severe air sac thickening with fungal plaques in interclavicular, thoracic, and abdominal air sacs (Fig. 27.15A). Plaques may appear blue- or olive-green, brown or black, and velvety if conidia develop. Compact mycelial masses (aspergillomas) may form in respiratory cavities. Pulmonary parenchyma is replaced by disseminated pearl-like pale white to yellow granulomas (Fig. 27.15B). Granulomas and granulomatous inflammation with fungal growth may extend along the celomic serosa and invade the liver, kidney, and adrenal glands. Histologically, visceral lesions have multifocal necrosis that surrounds large numbers of radially arranged, lightly basophilic to transparent, 3\u20136 \u03bcm, regularly septate, thin- and parallel-walled fungal hyphae with dichotomous, acute angled branching accompanied by marked heterophilic infiltration. Necrotic cores are surrounded by dense infiltrates of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, heterophils, and sparser lymphocytes and plasma cells. Air sacs are markedly thickened and expanded by similar inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrosis may be evident. Mats of fungal hyphae and conidia frequently replace air sac lining (Fig. 27.15C). Dual infection with avian malaria should be considered when splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are observed.",

Host cell rupture releases merozoites into the blood and results in additional infection of reticuloendothelial cells (undergoing new cycles of exoerythrocytic merogony) or infection of erythrocytes (proceeding to erythrocytic merogony or gametogony). Within erythrocytes, merozoites develop into trophozoites, which further differentiate into either erythrocytic meronts or gametocytes (macrogametocytes or microgametocytes).

Despite extensive research, a definitive etiology is currently not established (Alley et al., 2016, Denk and Stidworthy, 2016). Proposed causes include underlying viruses, polymicrobial infection, protozoal (trichomoniasis) or fungal infections, and environmental factors including mucosal injury due to foreign body trauma or biotoxins. However, the latter appear unlikely across captive and wild scenarios. Environmental hygiene may be important and prophylactic antibiotic treatment appears to limit the incidence in some collections. A novel avian alpha herpesvirus, preliminarily designated Spheniscid herpesvirus 1, has recently been isolated and characterized in Humboldt and African penguins with typical lesions (Pfaff et al., 2017).
