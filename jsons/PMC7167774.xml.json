Since the cough resolves once the underlying infection is treated, this suggests malacia has a limited causative role.8 Nevertheless, tracheo\u2010bronchomalacia impairs airway clearance,85 increasing the likelihood of persistent lower airway infection and inflammation. Tracheo\u2010bronchomalacia is also found commonly in children with PBB.8, 19 This association may be primary (airway malacia predisposes to PBB through reduced efficiency in airway clearance) or secondary (malacia developing because of intense airway inflammation86, 87). One retrospective study reported tracheo\u2010bronchomalacia was present in 52/74 (74%) children with PBB.19 However, a prospective study involving 104 children with PBB found that these airway abnormalities were no more common in children with PBB than in those undergoing bronchoscopy for other respiratory indications at a tertiary pediatric hospital (68% vs. 53%, respectively).33 Nevertheless, these proportions are higher than estimates for the general population (1 in 2,100)31 and there is little doubt that children with tracheo\u2010bronchomalacia have a higher frequency of respiratory infections and symptoms.88, 89 \n",
