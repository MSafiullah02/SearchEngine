            "text": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity as the core clinical features. The motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease are the result of the functional loss of dopamine in the striatum due to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal neuronal pathway [1, 2]. The exact cause of Parkinson\u2019s disease is unknown, and symptoms worsen over time as the disease progresses. Although current pharmacotherapy provides symptomatic relief, no treatment has been proven to slow or halt the progression of the disease [3]. Levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, remains the most effective treatment for restoring dopamine levels in the parkinsonian brain [4, 5]. However, due to extensive peripheral enzymatic metabolism by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), only a fraction of the levodopa dose reaches the brain [6\u20138].",

It also methylates other hydroxylated metabolites and catechol compounds in the diet [8]. COMT catalyses the transmission of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) to a hydroxyl group of a catechol substrate in the presence of magnesium. The enzyme is widely distributed throughout the body with the liver containing the highest COMT activity [9]. Membrane-bound COMT (MB-COMT) and the soluble isoform of COMT, S-COMT, are the two major isoforms of the enzyme [10]. S-COMT is dominant in the peripheral tissue, and MB-COMT is mainly found in the brain.",

New-generation COMT inhibitors, such as the nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors (e.g. entacapone or tolcapone), are thus frequently used as adjunct to levodopa in Parkinson\u2019s disease [12]. The clinical value of nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors is sometimes limited by adverse effects such as diarrhoea, hepatitis and neurological reactions, particularly for tolcapone [8].",

The 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one scaffold was chosen since the COMT inhibitory potential of several compounds from this class has been illustrated [13, 14]. 3-Hydroxypyridin-4-one is an isostere of the catechol ring, but is normally not O-methylated by the enzyme (Fig. 1). Further, it has been illustrated that non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors can be MB-COMT specific, which may be beneficial when considering that the peripheral side effects of COMT inhibitors are mostly related to their dopaminergic effects [13]. 3-Hydroxypyridin-4-ones may have three advantages over traditional nitrocatechol inhibitors: (1) Several derivatives have been shown to be orally active and are efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract [15]; (2) due to the presence of excessive iron deposits in the basal ganglia of the brain that have been associated with the aetiology of Parkinson\u2019s disease [16], it may be of clinical benefit that 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones display iron chelating activity [15, 17], which may reduce oxidative damage to susceptible neurons; and (3) analgesic effects of certain 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones have further been illustrated in previous studies, indicating similar potency compared to aspirin and similar anti-inflammatory activity compared to indomethacin [18]. This may be beneficial for neuroinflammation, which has been implicated in neurodegeneration in Parkinson\u2019s disease [19].",

A modified procedure reported in the literature was validated and used to measure COMT activity [22]. For this purpose, (\u2212)-norepinephrine served as enzyme substrate, and the formation of the O-methylated product, normetanephrine, was quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. A Km value of 379 \u00b5M was estimated for the methylation of (\u2212)-norepinephrine by COMT, which is similar to that reported in the literature of 488 \u00b5M [22]. The determination of IC50 values should be carried out with the substrate concentration approximately equal to Km, and a typical enzyme reaction thus contained (\u2212)-norepinephrine (250 \u00b5M), SAMe, MgCl2 and the test inhibitors. The reactions were initiated with the addition of the COMT enzyme, and after 60-min incubation, the reactions were terminated with perchloric acid. Following centrifugation, the supernatant fractions were analysed by HPLC for normetanephrine content. By measuring COMT activity in the presence of various concentrations of the test inhibitors, sigmoidal plots of enzyme catalytic rate versus the logarithm of inhibitor concentration were constructed from which the IC50 values were determined (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "The 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one derivatives exhibited COMT inhibitory activity with 2 and 10 as the most potent COMT inhibitors of the series with IC50 values of 4.55 \u03bcM and 5.76 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 1). Although active, these 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one derivatives are not as potent as the reference inhibitors, entacapone (IC50 = 0.00047 \u00b5M) and tolcapone (IC50 = 0.0068 \u00b5M). They may, however, serve as leads for the development of non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors with better side effect profiles [13]. Further investigation in this regard is required. Based on the IC50 values, preliminary structure\u2013activity relationships (SARs) were derived for the inhibition of COMT by the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones: (1) Phenyl substitution of the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one moiety (1) resulted in a higher IC50 value (and thus lower inhibition potency) compared to benzyl substitution (2). Benzyl substitution of the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one moiety also resulted in improved COMT inhibition compared to phenylethyl (3), phenylpropyl (4) and phenylbutyl (5) substitution. This showed that chain elongation of the substituent reduces COMT inhibition potency and that the methylene (CH2) linker between the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one moiety and phenyl ring was more optimal than the other linkers considered [(CH2)2, (CH2)3 and (CH2)4]. When comparing phenyl (1) substitution of the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one moiety to cyclohexyl substitution (6), the aromatic substituent yielded slightly more favourable inhibition than the aliphatic substituent. Compared to cyclohexyl substitution (6), a reduction in COMT inhibition potency was observed for cyclopentyl substitution (7). In fact, 7 was the weakest COMT inhibitor of the series of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one derivatives. When comparing the phenyl-substituted derivative (1) with the derivatives containing chlorine on the phenyl ring, compounds 8 and 9, it was apparent that chlorine substitution on the meta and para positions of the phenyl ring did not significantly affect COMT inhibition potency. Similarly, when the benzyl-substituted derivative 2 was substituted with a methyl substituent on the para position of the phenyl ring (to yield 10), COMT inhibitory activity remained relatively unchanged. Benzyl substitution of the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one moiety (2 and 10) thus yielded the most potent COMT inhibitory activity among the compounds evaluated. The reference inhibitors, entacapone (IC50 = 0.00047 \u00b5M) and tolcapone (IC50 = 0.0068 \u00b5M), proved to be highly potent COMT inhibitors.",

The protein model of human COMT complexed with 3,5-dinitrocatechol was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 3BWM) [23]. The catechol binding site of COMT presents as a shallow cleft on the protein surface. It is defined by Met40, Leu198, Tyr200 as well as the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d residues Trp38 and Pro174, which ensures the correct orientation of the substrate for methylation [23]. Mg2+, which is a co-factor for the methylation reaction, is octahedrally coordinated to the side chains of Asp141 and Asp169, Asn170, the two hydroxy groups of the catechol substrate, and a water molecule [23]. Although not shown, the 1-hydroxy group of 3,5-dinitrocatechol is within hydrogen bonding distance to Glu199 and Asn170 in the shallow catechol binding site, while the 2-hydroxy and 3-nitro groups are within hydrogen bond distance to Lys144 (Fig. 4). The potential for hydrogen bonding and coordination with the Mg2+ ion underscores the importance of the catechol structure for binding to COMT.",

The protein models were prepared by first calculating the pKa values and protonation states of the amino acid residues, which was followed by an energy minimisation with the protein backbone constrained. The structures of the ligands (3,5-dinitrocatechol and compound 2) were drawn in Discovery Studio, and after docking with CDOCKER, the docked orientations were refined using in situ ligand minimisation. Among the ten solutions generated, solutions existed for each ligand where the catechol hydroxyl groups of 3,5-dinitrocatechol or the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one system of 2 are correctly placed for coordination with the Mg2+. As these are most probable, these solutions were selected and are presented here. The accuracy of the docking procedure was evaluated by redocking the co-crystallized ligand, 3,5-dinitrocatechol, into the active site of COMT. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the selected docked orientation from the position of the co-crystallised ligand was calculated to be 0.418 \u00c5. RMSD values < 1.5 \u00c5 are considered to be successful, and this protocol was thus deemed appropriate for docking experiments with COMT [25].",

The 1-benzyl side chain projects towards the exterior of the enzyme and mainly undergoes van der Waals interactions with Trp38 and Trp143. It may be concluded that compound 2 has the ability to adopt a similar orientation to 3,5-dinitrocatechol within the COMT active site and forms the appropriate polar interactions. The molecular reason for its lower potency compared to the nitrocatechol inhibitors, however, is not apparent. Based on the similarity of binding and interaction network between 3,5-dinitrocatechol and 2, it may be postulated that with appropriate structure modification, the COMT inhibition potencies of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one may be significantly improved.",

Deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6) was used for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and was purchased from Merck. A Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer was used to record proton (1H) and carbon (13C) NMR spectra at 600 MHz and 150 MHz, respectively. To process and analyse the NMR data, MestReNova2 was used. Data reported included integration (e.g. 1H), multiplicity and coupling constants (J) given in hertz (Hz). Chemical shifts (\u03b4), in parts per million (ppm), were referenced to the residual solvent (DMSO-d6) signal at 2.5 ppm for 1H NMR and 39.5 ppm for 13C NMR. Spin multiplicities were presented as s (singlet), br s (broad singlet), d (doublet), br d (broad doublet), ddd (doublet of doublet of doublets), t (triplet), br t (broad triplet), p (pentet) or m (multiplet). Note that the OH proton of the 3-hydroxy group was not observed in the 1H NMR spectra. A Bruker micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer functioning in atmospheric-pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) mode was used to record high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS). Infrared spectra were obtained using an Alpha Bruker Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Opus 7.0.129 software was used to process and record IR data, reporting absorption bands in cm\u22121. TLC (thin-layer chromatography) was used to monitor the progress of the reactions and to determine whether the reactions were complete. The reagents and products were dissolved in methanol, applied to silica gel 60 aluminium-coated TLC sheets (Merck) and developed in an appropriate mobile phase. Ethyl acetate was used as eluent during TLC of compounds 1, 2, 8 and 9, while a mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate (9:1) was used as mobile phase for compounds 3\u20137 and 10. The developed TLC sheets were visualised under an UV lamp at a wavelength of 254 nm. HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) analyses were performed to estimate the purities of the synthesised compounds. These were conducted with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a quaternary pump and an Agilent 1100 series diode array detector. HPLC-grade acetonitrile (Merck) and Milli-Q water (Millipore) were used for the preparation of the mobile phase. A Venusil XBP C18 column (4.60 \u00d7 150 mm, 5 \u00b5m) was used as analytical column. Initially, the mobile phase consisted of 30% acetonitrile and 70% Milli-Q water and the flow rate was set to 1 mL/min. A solvent gradient programme was initiated at the beginning of each HPLC run. This was done by linearly increasing the composition of the acetonitrile in the mobile phase to 85% acetonitrile over a 5-min period. HPLC runs lasted 15 min, and a 5-min period was allowed for equilibration of the system. The test compounds were dissolved in acetonitrile to a concentration of 1 mM, and 20 \u00b5L of these solutions was injected into the HPLC system. The eluent was monitored at a wavelength of 254 nm.",

The samples were centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 10 min, and the supernatants were analysed by HPLC. The peak areas of normetanephrine were recorded, and the corresponding concentrations of normetanephrine formed were calculated using a calibration curve (1\u201330 \u00b5M). Using the Prism 5 (GraphPad) software package, the data were fitted to the equation for one-site competition to yield a sigmoidal curve of concentration of normetanephrine formed versus the logarithm of inhibitor concentration. IC50 values were estimated from these plots. For each test inhibitor, the IC50 values were determined in triplicate and expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.",

The default \u2018prepare protein\u2019 option was used to protonate the model, and the pKa values and protonation states of the ionisable amino acids were calculated at pH 7.4. The valences of the cofactors and co-crystallised ligand (3,5-dinitrocatechol) were corrected, and the protein models were automatically typed with the Momany and Rone CHARMm forcefield. The Smart Minimizer algorithm was used to minimise the protein structure using a fixed backbone constraint and the generalised born approximation with molecular volume (GBMV) as solvent model (50,000 steps). The crystal water molecules were deleted, and the binding site was defined from the position of the co-crystallised ligand. The structures of 2 and 3,5-dinitrocatechol were constructed in Discovery Studio and prepared using the \u2018prepare ligands\u2019 function. The Momany and Rone CHARMm forcefield was used to assigned atom potential types and partial charges to the ligands. The prepared ligands were then docked into the active site of the COMT model using the CDOCKER algorithm, allowing for ten random ligand conformations and the heating target temperature set to 700 K in full potential mode. The docking solutions were finally refined using in situ ligand minimisation with the Smart Minimizer algorithm. The illustrations were prepared with the PyMOL molecular graphics system [26].",
