A methanol extract of G. uralensis roots was prepared and subjected to purification procedures, as described previously 23, 24, 25, 26.

The monoglucuronide form of glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid 3\u2010O\u2010glucuronide, did not show significant anti\u2010HCV activity at the concentration tested.

The results obtained clearly demonstrated that glycycoumarin, glycyrin and glycyrol inhibit HCV RNA replication, resulting in decreased HCV protein synthesis as demonstrated by both real\u2010time quantitative RT\u2010PCR and immunoblotting analyses (Fig. 1a, b). We also confirmed that production of HCV infectious particles is inhibited by glycycoumarin, glycyrin and glycyrol at 1 and 2 days post\u2010infection (Fig 1c).",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin is the major constituent of Glycyrrhiza species, representing 1\u20139% of the total 14. Glycyrrhizin and other compounds isolated from Glycyrrhiza species reportedly possess antiviral activity against a variety of viruses 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. With regard to HCV, it was recently reported that glycyrrhizin inhibits HCV infection in Huh\u20107 cells 19, 20. On the other hand, controversial observations have been reported in clinical settings; namely, that glycyrrhizin has no significant effect on amounts of HCV RNA whereas it reduces serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations in HCV\u2010infected patients 16, 17. These apparently contradictory findings might be explained by a membrane\u2010stabilizing effect of glycyrrhizin; clear evidence for antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin is still lacking 10. In the present study, we observed that glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid monoammonium showed only marginal anti\u2010HCV activity (Table 3). Glycyrrhetinic acid showed significant anti\u2010HCV activity. However, their anti\u2010HCV activities were significantly weaker than that of the HPLC fractions obtained from G. uralensis extract. On the other hand, we found that certain coumarins, such as glycycoumarin, glycyrin and glycyrol, and a flavanone, liquiritigenin, isolated from G. uralensis, as well as other compounds contained in Glycyrrhiza species, possess potent anti\u2010HCV activities. Mode\u2010of\u2010action analysis revealed that all the Glycyrrhiza\u2010derived anti\u2010HCV compounds tested act primarily at the post\u2010entry step. Consistent with our observations, other researchers have also reported that two flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin and glycycoumarin, extracted from Glycyrrhizae radix, either G. uralensis or G. glabra, inhibit replication of an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon  in vitro\n35. The IC50 values of isoliquiritigenin and glycycoumarin against HCV subgenomic replicon were 6.2 and 15.5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published reports so far regarding anti\u2010HCV activities of glycyrin and glycyrol. It has been reported that glycyrin, which is known to possess peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 ligand\u2010binding activity, shows antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis\n36, 37, 38. Glycyrol reportedly exerts anti\u2010inflammatory effects by binding to calcineurin to inhibit its activity 39, 40. However, the possible antimicrobial activity of glycyrol has not been reported. Further study is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of anti\u2010HCV activities of glycyrin and glycyrol, and also possible antiviral activities against viruses other than HCV.",
