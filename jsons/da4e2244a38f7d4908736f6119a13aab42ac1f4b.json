Nevertheless, major efforts are required for those laboratories-as ours-26 serving hospitals that are redesigning their configuration to convert ordinary wards in \"COVID\" 27 wards as much as possible. Consequently, laboratories are not only asked to early detect patients 28 infected with SARS-CoV-2 but also to confirm COVID-19 cases in order to identify and quarantine In conclusion, our findings support the concept that the clinical microbiology laboratory may be 81 extraordinarily responsive to emergencies like the one we are experiencing. While providing a 82 concrete example on how to expand the laboratory response capacity, we are aware that we have to 83 considerably optimize the response to the COVID-19 impending threat yet. ",

This experience started on March 1-when our regional government authorized 34 laboratories, other than the national reference laboratory in Rome, to perform real-time PCR assays 35 to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples-and ended on March 24 (i.e., at the 36 time of writing).",

            "text": "We identified three decisive interventions that contributed to optimizing our COVID-1938 diagnostic laboratory workflow, and we assessed the turnaround time (TAT) values for positive or 39 3 negative results as key efficiency's indicators. We performed viral RNA detection in all samples 40 using the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved Allplex 2019-nCoV assay (Arrow 41 Diagnostics S.r.l., Genova, Italy)-a single-tube assay able to detect the three target genes (i.e., E 42 gene, RdRP gene and N gene) as in WHO recommended protocols. Thus, TAT (i.e., the time from 43 sample receipt in the laboratory to release of PCR result) was depending either on the time taken for 44 pre-PCR steps or on laboratory working hours (i.e., 12 h/day versus 24 h/day). Overall, we 45 processed 5074 samples of patients suspected for COVID-19 virus infection-who were admitted to 46 FPG and other Lazio hospitals-with a minimum of five to a maximum of 466 samples per day and 47 with a median TAT value of 8 (interquartile range [IQR], 7-10.75) h. The number of samples tested 48 for COVID-19 greatly exceeded the number of samples routinely tested for most common 49 respiratory viruses. For example, in February 2020, we processed 547 samples for viral agents other 50 than SARS-CoV-2. 51 In particular, we started using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL system (14 samples per run) to 52 automatically extract sample RNA before performing the Allplex 2019-nCoV assay (two runs/12 53 h). As shown in Figure 1, TAT increased (median values, 18 [IQR, 14.50-20.50] h to 24 [IQR, 21-54 27] h) until to March 6, when we decided to extend working hours to night shifts (i.e., 7 p.m. to 7 55 a.m.). Following this intervention (i.e., the first), TAT decreased (median values, 6 [IQR, 4-8] h to 56 8 [IQR, 6-9] h) until to March 10, when we decided to use the Seegene Nimbus automated 57 system-that uses STARMag Universal Cartridge kit-(40 samples per run) for RNA extraction 58 and PCR assay setup. This intervention (i.e., the second) allowed TAT to return to median values of 59 6 (IQR, 4-9) h to 8 (IQR, 5-10) h. On March 21, TAT increased (median value, 18 [IQR, 12.75-60 21] h), thus requiring a further intervention (i.e., the third). This involved use of the QIAGEN 61 QIAsymphony SP/AS automated system (96 samples per run) for RNA extraction and PCR assay 62 setup. Once again, TAT returned to above values and remained stable for the following days. Of 63 note, passing from Seegene Nimbus to QIAGEN QIAsymphony SP/AS led to a decrease of samples the successful implementation of the Allplex 2019-nCoV assay into our routine 67 laboratory workflow, which was directed to diagnose other (albeit less relevant) microbial 68 pathogens. Thus, as experimented in other European laboratories [5], increasing sample numbers to 69 be daily processed compelled to substantial changes in the laboratory work organization. These 70 changes did not involve purchase or loan of equipment-QIAGEN EZ1, Seegene Nimbus and 71 QIAGEN QIAsymphony instruments were already available in the laboratory-but involved 72 redesigning of the instruments' exploitation. Consequently, while continuing to perform the routine 73 diagnostic testing (despite with delayed TAT [data mot shown]), the existing laboratory staff, in 74 cooperation with newly-ad hoc-employed personnel, directed their skills toward a new, 75 laborious and expensive diagnostic challenge. In particular, a qualified (no specific training was 76 necessary), tireless (extra working hours including holydays were spent) and robust (no one got sick 77 of COVID-19) staff was composed of eight senior and three junior workers who were almost 78 exclusively committed to perform SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of note, the new personnel worked only 79 during the night shifts.",
