The guideline does not discuss active surveillance testing or other prevention strategies. Each section of the guideline begins with a specific clinical question and is followed by numbered recommendations and a summary of the most-relevant evidence in support of the recommendations. Areas of controversy in which data are limited or conflicting and in which additional research is needed are indicated throughout the document and are highlighted in the Future Research section.",

Therefore, it is extremely important that physicians exclude the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis to prevent inappropriate administration of antimicrobials to large numbers of patients with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. Such therapy unnecessarily exposes patients to the expense and hazards of antimicrobial therapy. Despite improvements in antimicrobial prescribing for children and adults with acute pharyngitis, a substantial number of patients continue to receive inappropriate antimicrobial therapy [13\u201315]. Inappropriate antimicrobial use for upper respiratory tract infections, including acute pharyngitis, has been a major contributor to the development of antimicrobial resistance among common pathogens [15]. Estimated economic costs of pediatric streptococcal pharyngitis in the United States range from $224 million to $539 million per year, including indirect costs related to parental work losses [16].\n",

The disorder is primarily a disease of children 5\u201315 years of age, and, in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. Patients with GAS pharyngitis commonly present with sore throat (generally of sudden onset), pain on swallowing, and fever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also be present, especially in children. On examination, patients have tonsillopharyngeal erythema, with or without exudates, often with tender, enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes (lymphadenitis). Other findings may include a beefy, red, swollen uvula; petechiae on the palate; excoriated nares (especially in infants); and a scarlatiniform rash. However, none of these findings are specific for GAS pharyngitis. Conversely, the absence of fever or the presence of clinical features such as conjunctivitis, cough, hoarseness, coryza, anterior stomatitis, discrete intra-oral ulcerative lesions, viral exanthema, and diarrhea strongly suggest a viral rather than a streptococcal etiology.\n",

Therefore, except when obvious viral clinical and epidemiological features are present, a laboratory test should be performed to determine whether GAS is present in the pharynx [9, 21]. Efforts have been made to incorporate the clinical and epidemiological features of acute pharyngitis into scoring systems that attempt to predict the probability that a particular illness is caused by GAS pharyngitis [19, 20, 22]. These clinical scoring systems are helpful in identifying patients who are at such low risk of streptococcal infection that performance of a throat culture or an RADT is usually unnecessary. However, the signs and symptoms of streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap too broadly for diagnosis to be made with the requisite diagnostic precision on the basis of clinical grounds alone. Even subjects with all clinical features in a particular scoring system can be confirmed to have streptococcal pharyngitis only about 35%\u201350% of the time, and this is particularly the case in children [20, 23]. The clinical diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis cannot be made with certainty even by the most experienced physicians, and bacteriologic confirmation is required.",

In addition to endemic pharyngitis, GCS can cause epidemic food-borne pharyngitis after ingestion of contaminated products, such as unpasteurized cow's milk. Family and school outbreaks of GCS pharyngitis have also been described. Even though there are several well-documented food-borne outbreaks of group G streptococcal (GGS) pharyngitis, as well as a community-wide respiratory outbreak of GGS pharyngitis in children [30], the etiologic role of GGS in acute, endemic pharyngitis remains unclear. Acute rheumatic fever has not been described as a complication of either GCS or GGS pharyngitis. Reports have attempted to link acute glomerulonephritis with GGS pharyngitis, but a causal relationship has not been established. Acute glomerulonephritis as a complication of GCS pharyngitis is extremely unusual. Therefore, the primary reason to identify either GCS or GGS as the etiologic agent of acute pharyngitis is to initiate antibiotic therapy that may reduce the clinical impact of the illness. Currently, there is no convincing evidence from controlled studies of a clinical response to antibiotic therapy in patients with acute pharyngitis and either GCS or GGS isolated from the throat.",

In emergency department practice, a 4-factor algorithm predicted a positive result of GAS throat culture with an accuracy of 32%\u201356%, depending on the number of required clinical features present [22]. However, use of this diagnostic strategy would result in treatment of an unacceptably large number of adults with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis; that is an undesirable result in this age group, which has a low prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and a very low risk of rheumatic fever or rheumatic carditis. However, because of the above noted features of acute pharyngitis in adults, exclusion of the diagnosis on the basis of negative RADT results without confirmation by negative culture results is an acceptable alternative to diagnosis on the basis of throat culture results [36]. The generally high specificity of RADT should minimize overprescription of antimicrobials for treatment of adults. This latter point is of particular importance in view of national data indicating that antibiotics\u2014frequently, the more expensive, broader-spectrum antibiotics\u2014are prescribed for approximately three-quarters of adults who consult community primary care physicians because of a sore throat [14]. Physicians who wish to ensure they are achieving maximal sensitivity in diagnosis may continue to use conventional throat culture or to back up negative RADT results with a culture [20, 58].",

For those patients, the median age was 4 years [64]. In countries where ARF is more common than in the United States, the rate among young children is also low [66, 68, 69]. This is thought to be because it may take repeated exposures to GAS or priming of the immune system before there is an immune response to streptococcal pharyngitis that can lead to rheumatic fever [70]. The low prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and the low risk of developing ARF in children <3 years of age limits the usefulness of diagnostic testing in this age group.",

During the winter and spring in temperate climates, as many as 20% of asymptomatic school-age children may be GAS carriers. They may be colonized by GAS pharyngitis for \u22656 months and during that time may experience episodes of intercurrent viral pharyngitis [115, 117]. Testing of such patients often demonstrates evidence of GAS in the pharynx, and thus they may mimic patients with acute streptococcal pharyngitis. Individuals who are identified as chronic pharyngeal GAS carriers do not ordinarily require further antimicrobial therapy. Carriers appear to be unlikely to spread the organism to their close contacts and are thought to be at very low risk, if any, for developing suppurative or invasive complications or nonsuppurative complications (eg, acute rheumatic fever) [48, 114, 116]. Additionally, it is much more difficult to eradicate GAS pharyngitis from the throats of carriers than from patients with bona fide acute streptococcal infections [81, 116, 117]. This is particularly true for penicillin or amoxicillin therapy and may also be true for some other antimicrobials [114, 116, 117]. Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggests that, in published studies showing penicillin or amoxicillin to have relatively high failure rates for eradicating GAS pharyngitis, the patient population was likely \u201ccontaminated\u201d with chronic carriers [114, 117].",

For a single episode of pharyngitis associated with laboratory confirmation of GAS that occurs shortly after completion of a course of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, treatment with any of the agents listed in Table 2 is appropriate. Since patient adherence to oral antimicrobial therapy often is an issue, intramuscular benzathine penicillin G should be considered.

It is likely that most of these patients are chronic streptococcal carriers who are experiencing repeated viral infections. For patients with frequent discrete episodes, information regarding the precise nature of the presenting signs and symptoms (Table 4), the clinical response to antibiotic therapy, and the presence or absence of GAS pharyngitis in cultures of throat swabs obtained during asymptomatic intervals is helpful in distinguishing persistent carriage from recurrent episodes of acute GAS pharyngitis. Serotyping or genotyping of streptococcal isolates recovered from specimens obtained during distinct episodes from an individual patient may also assist in arriving at this determination because a carrier has persistence of the same strain of GAS over time. Unfortunately, such studies are available only from specialized research laboratories and are unlikely to be available within a practical time frame. There have been no definitive controlled studies of treatment of multiple repeated symptomatic episodes of culture-positive acute pharyngitis in the same person. However, the regimens listed in Table 5 have been reported to result in low rates of bacteriologic failure [81, 118\u2013120]. Continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis is not recommended except to prevent recurrent ARF in patients who have experienced a previous episode of rheumatic fever.",
