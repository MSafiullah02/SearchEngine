A device capable of identifying this combination of bacteria and viruses must be able to overcome complexities associated with potentially highly variable genomes, which is especially relevant to influenza A subtyping. To date, there are 16 identified hemagglutinin [1] and 9 neuraminidase subtypes for Influenza A. This RNA virus has a negative strand, segmented genome, and can infect a broad range of animals including humans. Identification of a virus subtype is typically by serological or molecular identification of the subtype of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. Viruses with any combination of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes can infect aquatic birds whereas fewer subtypes have been found to infect humans. However, interspecies transmission can occur after recombination or mixing of subtypes in birds or pigs [2, 16, 65]. In addition, new human strains of virus can arise by reassortment to accomplish antigenic shift when two or more subtypes infect the same host [3, 4].",
