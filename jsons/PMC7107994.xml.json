Physical examination showed a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, clear lungs, and no obvious focus of infection. His fever resolved with treatment with ribavirin and methylprednisolone (dosage, 120 mg per day), and his condition improved during the first week of treatment. A chest radiograph obtained on day 11 after the onset of symptoms revealed left lower lobe infiltrates. A complete blood count demonstrated an elevated WBC count of 16.4 \u00d7 109 cells/L, an increased level of neutrophils (15.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L), and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.4 \u00d7 109 cells/L). This suggests that the condition of the patient with SARS was complicated by a secondary bacterial infection. Treatment with methylprednisolone was switched to 160 mg per 12 h intravenously, coincident with the initiation of antibiotic therapy. After initiation of the treatment mentioned above, his condition gradually improved during the fourth week after onset, at which time a series of chest radiographs showed obvious resolution of the left lower lobe consolidation. His total WBC count returned to a normal level, but lymphopenia still persisted. Treatment with methylprednisolone was then reduced to 40 mg per 12 h. For the patient's complaint of obscured monocular vision, eye-ground examination was performed and revealed an exudation around the visual yellow zone on day 26 after onset of illness (27 April). Two days later, the patient experienced progressive central nervous symptoms, including dysphoria, vomiting, and deliria, and was found to have progression of left lower lobe consolidation, for which he was treated with noninvasive ventilation and methylprednisolone at a dosage of 80 mg per 12 h, coincident with initiation of treatment with ceftazidime (Fortum; Glaxo Wellcome) and immunoglobulin. Despite the management described above, his condition deteriorated, and a series of chest radiographs obtained during the fifth week after onset showed progressive bibasilar infiltration with severe leucopenia (WBC count, 0.86 \u00d7 109/L), lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.11 \u00d7 109 cells/L), and depressed marrow.",

By day 2 after admission to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, the patient developed breathness with slowing heart-throb; thus, he underwent intubation and received mechanical ventilation. His condition rapidly deteriorated; he experienced multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and brain herniation occurred. He died on day 3 after his admission to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases (35 days after the onset of illness).

At least 3 routes, including olfactory nerve, a hematogenous route, and lymphatic systems could be used by coronavirus to gain access to the CNS [10\u201312]. The cell lines of astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, neuroglioma, and oligodendrocyte were all susceptible to the infection of human coronaviruses [13\u201316]. Mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus, has been found to induce demyelinating disease of the CNS [17, 18]. Moreover, Glass and colleagues [19] recently reported a model of SARS-CoV infection in C57BL/6 mice that demonstrated that SARS-CoV was able to infect the brain. The finding that SARS-CoV infected the brain of the patient with SARS was consistent with findings of previous reports on neuroinvasion of the coronavirus family [13\u201319].",

However, DNA sequence analysis showed that there was no variation with significant substitution of amino acids on the spike protein of the SARS-CoV isolated from this patient with the primary isolates of SARS-CoV [4]. It is possible that SARS-CoV is characterized by behavioral abnormalities similar to those in human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, which have the capacity to infect the CNS but do not necessarily yield severe pathological symptoms [13,16], because local immune surveillance limits viral replication on a large scale [20]. On the basis of the consideration that a progressive lymphopenia and leukopenia developed [21, 22] during the disease course of this patient, we speculate that local immune surveillance in his brain was removed by severe immunodepression [21\u201323], leading to the amplification of infectious viruses.",

Consistent with that finding, this study showed that IP-10 in the blood of the patient with SARS was also highly increased. Furthermore, we found that the level of Mig, another CXCR3 chemokine, was highly elevated in the blood of the patient with SARS. In contrast to our finding, Wong et al. [26] reported that Mig could not be detected with significant increase in the blood of patients with SARS. The difference between the findings of Wong and colleagues and our results provides evidence for the hypothesis that the high level of Mig in the blood of this patient with SARS was associated with the invasion of SARS-CoV in the brain tissues. It has been reported that both Mig and IP-10 were involved in host defense and immune damage by attracting activated T cells, NK cells, and monocytes that express CXCR3 [27]. We could not detect a significant elevation in the IP-10 level, but we did detect a high expression of Mig in the brain. This result is different from findings of our previous study, which revealed a high level of IP-10 in the lungs of patients with SARS. The results of histopathologic examination and immunostaining indicated that the invasion of SARS-CoV of brain tissues brought about the induction of Mig in gliocytes, which in turn attracted CD68+ monocytes/macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes to the sites of virus infection [27, 28]. Infiltrated immune cells should be helpful to limit SARS-CoV infection of the brain. However, because the virus could not be eliminated effectively while the patient was immunodepressed, a high number of cytokines/chemokines released in response to SARS-CoV infection would contribute to the tissue damage [29, 30]. The brain damage caused by SARS-CoV infection might take the same immunopathological process that happened in the lung tissues of patients with SARS [25], although different chemoattractant factors were involved.",
