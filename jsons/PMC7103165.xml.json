After full conditioning regimens, almost all patients develop severe neutropenia and almost all patients develop neutropenic fever as an early clinical sign of infection. However, other symptoms of infection may masked by severe neutropenia. Therefore, the source of infection can only rarely be identified on clinical grounds or with the help of imaging techniques. The few, non-infectious causes of neutropenic fever during the early post-transplantation period include transfusion of blood products, administration of immunoglobulins, drug-induced fever (e.g. cytosinarabinoside, amphotericin B, bleomycin, G-CSF), allergies, and acute GvHD reaction, which can cause fever within days after transplantation.",

Other risk factors for infectious complications are extensive mucosal damage as a result of the conditioning treatment, bacterial colonization, local fungal and viral infections, reactivation of infections that have been acquired during previous neutropenic periods, and finally the use of central venous catheters. The number of stem cells in the graft and the type of GvHD prophylaxis are factors which determine the rate of hematopoeitic reconstitution and may therefore also influence incidence and severity of infections during the early post-transplantation period. Bacterial and fungal infections after allogeneic transplantation in neutropenia often take a life-threatening course. Bacterial pathogens account for about 90% of infections during this phase. Bacteremias are documented in 16\u201331% of patients after allogeneic transplantation, the majority (65\u201375%) being caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Infections due to Gram-negative bacteria are less frequent. Gram-negative infections, however, are generally associated with a significantly higher morbidity and mortality.",

In the case of pulmonary aspergillus infections, pleuritic chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis may also occur. Blood cultures may sometimes be positive for Candida species, but rarely for Aspergillus species. Aspergillus spp. that is found in clinical specimens from neutropenic patients may indicate a systemic infection with this pathogen [24]. However, the sensitivity of screening for systemic Aspergillus infections by culturing techniques is low. The significance of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of pulmonary fungal infections is therefore still disputed. When fungi are found in BAL specimens, it may be difficult to distinguish between contamination with fungi from the oropharynx and true invasive pulmonary infection. Even in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, cultures from BAL are often negative. Unfortunately, all serological procedures that have been established for detection of systemic fungal infections so far, have a low sensitivity and often also a low specificity for the detection of systemic mycoses. New serologic techniques may improve this situation. A new ELISA assay for the detection of galactomannan in serum as well as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of fungi-specific DNA are currently being evaluated [4, 5, 12, 18].",

New azoles with broad antimycotic activity or new generations of drugs such as the echinocandines or pneumocandins, are currently being investigated in clinical trials [9] and might become alternatives to amphotericin B for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in recipients of an allogeneic stem cell graft in the future.",
