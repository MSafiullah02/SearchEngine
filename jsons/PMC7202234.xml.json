This database covers three major mammal groups: nonhuman primates, carnivores, and terrestrial ungulates. Corresponding host phylogenies, of Primates, Carnivora and Cetartiodactyla, were downloaded from the 10kTrees project (Arnold et al. 2010), which provides up\u2010to\u2010date Bayesian phylogenies for these mammal orders. For each order, the 50% majority rule consensus of 10,000 phylogenies sampled from the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tree search (excluding burn\u2010in), was used in our main analyses (for details of phylogenetic reconstruction methods see Arnold et al. 2010). A second analysis, which used 1000 phylogenies sampled from the MCMC chain (again excluding burn\u2010in), was conducted to test whether the results were robust to phylogenetic uncertainty (details below). The dataset of host associations was then restricted to those RNA virus species recorded on more than one host species represented in a 10kTrees phylogeny.",

Of these, one (simian foamy virus, see Switzer et al. 2005) appeared in the primary dataset. Because this study is concerned with the dynamics of host switching (rather than \u201cfailure to speciate\u201d events), this virus was excluded from the final dataset. Had there been any unidentified failures to speciate, among the multihost viruses that were included in our analyses, they could potentially bias our conclusions. However, host\u2010virus associations over the time scales of mammal species divergence (generally, in the order of millions of years, e.g., dos Reis et al. 2012) have been rejected or considered less probable than recent host switches for the remaining viruses in our dataset.",

One potential problem for the identification of multihost viruses, and multihost parasites in general, is the accurate designation of species (e.g., Van Regenmortel 2011). For example, lumping of distinct parasite populations with different hosts into a single species might lead to overestimation of the number of host species exploited. To minimize this possible effect, the dataset was screened to ensure all included viruses were classified to the species level. We also note that the recent age of origin inferred for the majority of extant RNA viruses (Holmes 2003) suggests that any distinct strains, incorrectly lumped within the same species, would still represent very closely related lineages that achieved their current host range by host switches (the subject of this study).",

To test for such sampling bias, we measured sampling effort for each species of virus, or host, included in the dataset and checked for a relationship with the number of recorded hosts. As in previous studies of host range (e.g., Nunn et al. 2004), we estimated sampling effort using the number of citations for a given species in a comprehensive database of published articles, in this case the Web of Science (Web of Knowledge 2012). The number of citations for each virus was non\u2010normally distributed for the viruses of primates and carnivores (primates: Shapiro\u2013Wilk W= 0.317, P < 0.0001; carnivores: W= 0.676, P= 0.0005; ungulates: W= 0.982, P= 0.911).

Therefore, nonparametric Spearman's rank correlations were performed. Neither the number of citations for each virus, nor the average number of citations per host, was significantly correlated with the number of host species recorded for a given virus (virus citations, primates: P= 0.964; carnivores: P= 0.964; ungulates P= 0.667, average host citations, primates: P= 0.843; carnivores: P= 0.604; ungulates: P= 0.5).",

Spearman's rank correlations indicated that the sampling effort for each virus was not significantly correlated with HSD, for viruses of primates (P= 0.341), carnivores (P= 0.439) or ungulates (P= 0.083). Nor was the average number of citations per host species significantly correlated with HSD (primates: P= 0.126; carnivores: P= 0.72; ungulates: P= 0.75).

            "text": "A measure of phylogenetic distance between the host species exploited by a given multihost RNA virus was used to estimate host switch distances. Specifically, host switch distance (HSD) was estimated, for each virus, as the average phylogenetic distance between each pair (i, j) of host species of that virus:\n(1)\nwhere dij is the midbranch distance between two host species i and j, and n is the number of host species. The midbranch distance between two hosts is calculated as dij=Dij \u2010 (Ai + Aj)/2, where Dij is the patristic distance between host leaves i and j, and Ai (resp. Aj) is the length of the branch incident to host leaf i (resp. j). HSD is similar to previously proposed measures of phylogenetic host specificity (Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Poulin, Krasnov, and Mouillot 2011), but considers distances between branch midpoints rather than distances between leaves. Branch midpoints were used to model host switch events from a \u201ctake\u2010off\u201d site, at an unknown point along the branch to one of the host leaves, to a \u201clanding\u201d site, at an unknown point along the branch to another host leaf. Although this was the biologically motivated method of calculation, simulated phylogenetic distances between leaves were similarly distributed to those calculated between midbranch points (data not shown). HSD was not found to be significantly correlated with the number of hosts for viruses of primates (linear correlation P= 0.194), carnivores (P= 0.065), or ungulates (P= 0.295), suggesting that this measure of interhost phylogenetic distance is comparable for multihost viruses with different numbers of hosts (two hosts, three hosts, etc.). HSD values for each virus were then summarized by the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, calculated separately among the viruses of primates, carnivores, and ungulates. This provided four summary statistics for each host phylogeny, which could then be compared with similar statistics calculated for the data simulated under the theoretical models of preferential host switching (as described below).",

Simulations were performed separately for the three consensus phylogenies (Primates, Carnivora, and Cetartiodactyla). The patristic distance matrix corresponding to each phylogeny was used to derive a matrix of the midbranch distances (dij) between each possible pair of hosts (as described above). The probability of host switch success under each of the two models (probability  for the exponential model or  for the sigmoidal model) was then calculated for each possible pair of host species, with values of the decay parameter \u03b2 ranging from 0.01 to 2 in steps of 0.01. For sampling purposes, host switch probabilities (for a given phylogeny and with a given \u03b2 value) were then normalized by dividing the probability calculated for each possible host pair by the total probability of host switching (the sum probability over all possible pairs of species). A random sampling procedure was then used to sample interhost phylogenetic distances, according to the normalized probability of each possible host switch. Sampling from the normalized probabilities (rather than non\u2010normalized values) removes the effect of the phylogenetic constant \u03b3 (the probability of infection at a phylogenetic distance, dij, of zero), and ensures that a phylogenetic distance is sampled at every iteration. This is suitable for comparison with our observed data, which records only the presence of a pathogen (rather than recording absence vs. presence of each pathogen across all potential hosts, e.g.). Each sampled distance dij provides an estimate of host switch distance, HSD, where  (eq. 1). The sample size was set to match the recorded number of viruses for each host order (22 for Primates, 12 for Carnivora, and 4 for Cetartiodactyla). Four summary statistics were then calculated for each sample. These were the mean value of the HSD statistic (Fig. 2), and its variance, skewness, and kurtosis (Figs. S1\u2013S3). The use of these different sample sizes allowed us to test whether ABC could distinguish between simulations, with different models and parameter values, given sample sizes comparable to the numbers of viruses actually recorded in databases of host\u2010pathogen associations, such as that used in our study. The sampling procedure was repeated 1000 times for each unique combination of host phylogeny, model, and \u03b2 value, and the calculated summary statistics (HSD mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) were output for ABC.",

ABC allows model and parameter selection, and estimation of support for a selected model or parameter, under complex biological models for which computation of the likelihood function may be impracticable (Csill\u00e9ry et al. 2010). This is achieved by comparing summary statistics for observed data with similar statistics calculated for the simulated data. These comparisons are based on a rejection method, which repeatedly samples from the simulated statistics, accepting parameter values for a given simulation if the distance from the observed statistic is below a set threshold (which determines the proportion of accepted simulations). Accepted parameter values can be viewed as a sample from an approximate posterior probability distribution for that parameter. Regression techniques may then be applied to improve the estimates of distance between statistic values, and to produce a weighted and corrected approximation of the parameter posterior. Average posterior probabilities can then be calculated for different models, over the range of simulated parameter values, and compared using Bayes factors (Csill\u00e9ry 2012). Bayesian confidence (or, credible) intervals were calculated from each estimated posterior probability distribution, giving the interval within which there is a 95% probability that the parameter value lies.",

Cross\u2010validation for model and parameter selection was also performed to select the best performing ABC method and tolerance level, and to evaluate performance. Cross\u2010validation for \u201cmodel\u201d selection repeatedly samples from the simulated data and records the percentage of samples for which the simulation model is correctly identified, based on the simulated summary statistics. Cross\u2010validation for \u201cparameter\u201d selection repeatedly samples from the simulated data and calculates the prediction error for a given parameter (the sum of squared differences between true and estimated values divided by the variance (Csill\u00e9ry 2012)).

This indicates that relatively large samples of host\u2010virus associations allow for more effective model and parameter testing, but that even relatively small samples can provide information on host\u2010switching dynamics.",

Of the RNA viruses recorded in the GMPD, multihost viruses represented 96% of the total among primates, 32% among carnivores, and 44% among ungulates. Of these recorded multihost viruses, 42% had just two hosts and 82% had fewer than seven hosts, although a few virus species infected relatively large numbers of host species. The most extreme examples in the dataset were canine distemper virus (Morbillivirus, Paramyxoviridae) with 30 carnivore hosts, yellow fever virus (Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) with 26 primate hosts, and Bluetongue virus and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (Orbivirus, Reoviridae) each with four ungulate hosts; all viruses noted for their unusually broad host ranges (Harder and Osterhaus 1997; Purse et al. 2005; Chambers 2010; MacLachlan and Guthrie 2010; de Almeida et al. 2012).",

It is noteworthy that our tests across three mammal phylogenies (primates, carnivores and ungulates) all supported the same theoretical model and similarly strong effects from phylogenetic distance.

First, it has been observed that small phylogenetic distances (such as those between sister species, or within a subgenus (Perlman and Jaenike 2003) or genus (Tinsley and Majerus 2007)) can present very low barriers to host switching. Second, a number of recent studies suggest that the distribution of pathogens and parasites on the phylogeny of their hosts is affected by the phylogenetic distance between the host species (Charleston and Robertson 2002; Clayton et al. 2003a; Perlman and Jaenike 2003; Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Krasnov et al. 2004; Percy et al. 2004; Sorenson et al. 2004; Tinsley and Majerus 2007; Longdon et al. 2011). Third, it has been suggested that host switches over very large phylogenetic distances are comparatively rare. For example, few pathogens or parasites have hosts in difference orders or classes (Gifford et al. 2005; Woolhouse and Gowtage\u2010Sequeria 2005) and very few infect hosts in different phyla (Poulin and Mouillot 2003).",

Increasing values of \u03b2 indicate a declining effect of phylogenetic distance. However, the average host switch distance modeled with a particular \u03b2 value depends on the distribution of branch lengths on the host phylogeny (Fig. 2). Thus, the significant point is not the selected value of the \u03b2 parameter per se, but that the value supported for each phylogeny falls in the range where phylogenetic distance strongly affects the distribution of simulated host switches. This suggests that the dynamics of host switching by mammal RNA viruses have been strongly affected by host phylogeny.",

Our ABC procedure could perhaps be extended to incorporate estimates of \u03b3, based on statistics describing intrahost pathogen infectivity (e.g., see Tinsley and Majerus 2007), though it is not yet clear how informative this would be. Here we have tested two simple models that could be compared with the available data. Of course, simply finding that one model is better supported than another does not mean that that model is the correct one in all cases: however, we regard this as an important first step in understanding the general dynamics of host switching by RNA viruses. Furthermore, the ABC methods used here could be applied to other models as they arise.",

Comparison of observed and computer simulated host phylogenetic distributions for mammal RNA viruses, using ABC, supports a strong sigmoidal decay in the probability of a successful host switch as phylogenetic distance on the host phylogeny increases. The same model, with similar decay parameter values, is supported for all three studied host phylogenies (primates, carnivores, and ungulates). This suggests that the supported model is applicable across mammal RNA viruses, and may generalize to a wider range of coevolutionary systems. These findings provide an insight into the dynamics of host switching, an evolutionary factor thought be responsible for a majority (Holmes and Rambaut 2004) of emerging and re\u2010emerging infectious disease.",
