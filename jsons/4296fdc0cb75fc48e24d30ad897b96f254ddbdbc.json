A priori, given potential heightened environmental and psychosocial stressors, and a higher case of STEMI induced by viral illness (e.g. similar to influenza) (5) or mimickers such as COVID-19 myopericarditis an increase in STEMI activations would have been expected. Potential etiologies for the decrease in STEMI PPCI activations include avoidance of medical care due to social distancing or concerns of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital, STEMI misdiagnosis, and increased use of pharmacological reperfusion due to COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, we plan to continue to follow this early signal and investigate its causes. It is particularly crucial to understand if patient-based anxiety is decreasing presentation of STEMI patients to the US hospital system. ",

Participating hospital systems included 1-Minneapolis Heart Institute, Minneapolis, MN, 2-Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak, Royal Oak, MI, 3-The Christ Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, 4-Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 5-UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA, 6-Iowa Heart, Des Moines, IA, 7-Northwell Health Hospital, Manhasset, NY, 8-Prairie Cardiovascular, Springfield, IL, and 9-Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA In this study, March 1, 2020 was identified as the beginning of the \"After COVID\" (AC) period when US social life and medical operations were significantly affected (March 1 st also was the day that New York City (NYC), the epicenter of US COVID cases, reported its first COVID-19 case). Social distancing was recommended by the federal government on March 15 th . The \"Before COVID\" (BC) period was comprised of the 14 months leading up to the epidemic in the United States (January 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020). We now compared the BC and AC monthly total and average number of STEMI activations for each hospital. A mixed model with random intercepts corrected for time as a continuous variable was used to estimate the percent change in STEMI activations in BC versus AC period. The model estimate showed a decrease in STEMI activations of 38% (95% CI: 26, 49; p<0.001). All sites combined reported >180 STEMI activations every month (mean of 23.6 activations/month) in the BC period. In contrast all sites combined reported only 138 activations (mean of 15.3 activations/month) in the AC period (Figure 1).",
