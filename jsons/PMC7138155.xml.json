This is perhaps even more pertinent in the face of a new virus whose imaging features can be varied and unfamiliar. Indeed, it has long been recognised that breaking down technological barriers to contributing imaging studies directly from a picture archiving and communications system (PACS) viewer to a central imaging repository would make teaching and research in the National Health Service (NHS) more efficient and accurate. Overcoming such a bottleneck would also deliver the potential to exponentially upskill the radiology workforce in the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, in what is currently a highly dynamic situation. By bringing together thoracic CT expertise across the UK, a central COVID-19 imaging repository and database can help reduce unwarranted diagnostic variation, provide better quality care for patients, and provide a resource to accumulate knowledge rapidly. Such a database would also allow real-time tracking of confirmed CT cases and allow improved understanding of the significance of cases with positive CT findings, but negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. This will help collate valuable information for the NHS and Public Health England.",
