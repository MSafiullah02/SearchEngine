Public health institutes form a link between scientific research and public health policymaking and practice, and in this role they provide guidance and advice to public health policymakers. To do so, they need to make use of scientific evidence and to assess available intervention options effectively. For researchers and policy advisors who compile and evaluate scientific evidence for health interventions, mathematical modeling has proven to be a useful tool. Developing a mathematical model helps to synthesize information from different sources into a consistent framework that allows an integrated analysis of complex problems [1, 2]. Researchers in public health, who provide advice to policymakers, often use mathematical models to simulate the impact of various interventions or public health strategies, and to provide quantitative predictions of how interventions might affect population health in the future.",

            "text": "In some areas, the use of mathematical modeling for public health policy support has become standard practice at various levels of decision-making [3\u20135]. In the field of infectious disease control, mathematical modeling has a long history and has become an important tool in decision-making for public health in the last two decades. During the influenza pandemic of 2009, mathematical modeling helped the World Health Organization (WHO) outbreak response team and decision-makers in national outbreak response units with interpretation of outbreak data during the early phase of the epidemic [3]. Results from modeling studies also supported decisions about vaccination strategies during later stages of the outbreak by providing estimates of the basic reproduction number and evaluating how timing and targeting of vaccination to different population groups might impact the epidemic peak and duration [6\u20138]. More recently, during the large Ebola outbreak in West Africa, mathematical modelers estimated key parameters for outbreak control such as the impact of case isolation, contact-tracing with quarantine, and sanitary funeral practices on the numbers of new infections [9, 10]. When a vaccine against Ebola became available, mathematical modeling helped researchers and outbreak responders to design ring vaccination trials that could lead to successful testing of the vaccine despite a decreasing exposure risk during the declining epidemic phase [11, 12]. This experience has led the WHO to publish a guidance document on the design of vaccine efficacy trials during public health emergencies [13]. In the field of HIV prevention, modeling work by Granich and colleagues [14] has paved the way for UNAIDS to introduce the test-and-treat strategy with the long-term goal of elimination of HIV [15]. In the area of chronic diseases, models are used to generate projections of population health given demographic changes, distributions, and trends of risk factors in a population and possible effects of intervention programs [16\u201319].",

This creates a danger of insufficient investment for continuity and quality of modeling expertise.

The RIVM has a central role in infectious disease control and national prevention and population screening programs in the Netherlands and conducts independent (scientific) research in the field of public health, health services, environmental safety, and security. In this role, the RIVM produces numerous reports and publications on all aspects of public health, nutrition and food, health care, disaster management, nature, and the environment each year. Besides the \u2018classical\u2019 areas of application of mathematical modeling in infectious and chronic diseases, and to assess health effects of air pollution, we use models in the environmental sector for predicting the transport of substances through water and air [24], assessing the risks of exposure to toxic substances, and impact of radiation on health. Furthermore, there is a large area of application of microbial risk modeling [25] for establishing risk assessment for food safety or, more broadly, multi-criteria risk analysis including risk ranking of emerging infectious diseases [26]. In the health field as well as the environmental field, we use burden of disease measures, leading to the necessity of developing underlying models for exposure and disease progression [27, 28]. In public health, we use estimates of disease burden in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) to compare the impact of various diseases on population health and to provide guidance for policymakers on how resources should be used effectively to achieve health gains in the population [29] (Fig. 1).",

That these are not merely theoretical results, but may have considerable public health impact, is demonstrated by a recent modeling study. Its authors calculated the increased risk for severe disease outcomes due to the increased age at infection for unvaccinated individuals in highly vaccinated populations, an effect that is often overlooked by vaccine critics, who weigh benefits against risks of vaccination [41]. In a study investigating the impact of vaccination against pertussis, Aguas et al. used a simple mathematical model to show that increased vaccination coverage can lead to an increase in the incidence of severe pertussis cases [42]. Similarly, for foodborne infections with acquired immunity, Swart et al. [43] showed that decreasing environmental contamination with campylobacter might lead to an increase in the number of symptomatic infections individuals experience during their lifetime. The increasing focus on computational models has led researchers of all disciplines and users of modeling studies to underappreciate analytic results and theoretical insights. More generally, using modeling to generate knowledge requires a scientific approach, and a modeling study should lead to new insights on the topic at hand. Computation is only a small part of this process, whereas model design and interpretation are just as important for a good modeling study.",

This improves synergy of diverse research fields, to improve alignment of study design (i.e., data collection) and model development, and generates innovative research ideas. The disadvantage is that modelers may become isolated from other modeling colleagues and get insufficient feedback on technical aspects of their work [44].

For the infrastructural organization of bioinformatics, Kallioniemi recommended distinguishing two organizational levels: a central core unit operating institute-wide and smaller peripheral units embedded in research groups [45]. These authors stress the importance of sufficient contact of the embedded units with the others; the core unit can facilitate this. Also for mathematical modeling, an organizational structure that combines advantages of centralization and decentralization is preferable, because it retains the close collaboration of modelers with scientists of other disciplines while also providing sufficient critical mass for methodological feedback for modelers. The central core unit needs to assure transparency of its tasks and responsibilities for the entire institute.

Model development is often performed in projects with limited duration, after which it is difficult to update and maintain the model [44]. Also, elements of implementation are often neglected. Dissemination of results to stakeholders and policymakers often receives less attention, and little allocated time or budget. Consequently, models are often poorly maintained and are not exploited fully for public health policy support [4]. For example, disease models used for generating projections for the national public health \u2018foresight studies\u2019 [46] suffer from underfunding and a lack of critical mass of modelers to keep the model up to date with respect to modeling methods and input data [44].

Contributions of modeling to evidence-based decisions in public health policymaking are often not explicitly acknowledged, while they are instrumental in generating projections and estimates of health impact of interventions. A prominent example was the decision of the minister of health in the Netherlands about intervention strategies during the 2009 influenza pandemic [47, 48]. Mathematical modelers generated advice, almost daily, about the possible impact of vaccination, about vaccination strategies, and about number of vaccine doses needed. While use and impact of vaccination was discussed nationwide by media and public, most were never aware of the basis on which the Dutch Health Council provided advice and the minister of health decided about vaccine stockpiles and strategies. Thus, the value of the modeling could not be judged by a broader audience [49]. To improve the situation in the future, public health managers could organize communication between modelers and policymakers in so-called communities of practice, (i.e., groups that share a common concern such as a specific public health problem and try to find solutions together interactively), as suggested by Driedger et al.

We hope these will be useful for other public health institutes or organizations, which use mathematical modeling as a tool for policy support.Modeling is more than computation: it is a method of abstraction and understanding complex systems in a systematic manner.Modeling needs to be a scientific activity with state of the art approaches, if it is to produce relevant answers to policy questions.Contributions of modeling to the evidence base of policy decisions should be acknowledged more explicitly.For modeling to be of maximal value for a public health institute, the organization and budgeting of mathematical modeling in the institute should be transparent.A long-term strategy for how to position and develop mathematical modeling within the institute and with external partners should be in place.",
