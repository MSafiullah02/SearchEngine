            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China [1,2]. It has spread rapidly to other areas in China and worldwide. [3,4] The most common manifestations of COVID-19 included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, hypolymphaemia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], arrhythmia, shock, acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, and acute kidney injury) and death may occur in severe cases. [2,[5], [6], [7]] The course of the COVID-19 is long, and COVID-19 is highly contagious even during the incubation period. [8] Furthermore, asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2, accounting for 1% of the laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-infection, [9] may potentially transmit the virus during incubation time, [10] which makes the identification and prevention of COVID-19 infection highly challenging. During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, we encountered a small number of asymptomatic patients who underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection, but the clinical manifestations and prognosis of these patients were beyond our expectation. It is our belief that these represent a specific surgical patient population that deserves our attention.",

A study by Chen and colleagues reported nine pregnant women who had COVID-19 infection and whose babies needed to be delivered via cesarean section surgery. [11] However, this report mainly focused on the general clinical characteristics of pregnant women and whether or not intrauterine vertical transmission may occur. The data on the impact of surgery performed unintentionally during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection on the outcomes of patients are lacking, but are of utmost importance to reduce the morbidity and mortality, given that surgery may cause an immediate impairment of cell-mediated immunity, [12] one of the major mechanisms that bring viral infections under control. [13] In this study, we aim to present the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients undergoing elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection and to compare severe patients who received ICU care during disease progression and those who did not receive ICU care. We hope that our findings of the SARS-CoV-2 associated postoperative morbidity and mortality will benefit the global community in the battle against COVID-19 infection.",

[14] Laboratory confirmation of SAR-CoV-2 was done by quantitative RT-PCR on samples from the respiratory tract, which was performed by the local health authority as described. [2,5] Of these patients, 3 patients were visited shortly after surgery by persons who were thereafter confirmed for COVID-19 infection, which made us difficult to judge whether or not the patients\u2019 infections were due to their exposures prior to surgery. Thus, these 3 patients were excluded, and finally 34 patients were included in this study.",

The patients developed COVID-19 symptoms very shortly (average 2\u00b76 days) after surgery completion. The median time of COVID-19 onset (which was defined as the date when the first sign or symptom was noticed) to dyspnea in the current study was 3\u00b75 days (IQR, 2\u00b70\u20135\u00b73), which is shorter than the reported time of 8\u00b70 days (IQR, 5\u00b70\u201313\u00b70) from the onset of first symptom to dyspnea in a study of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with SARS-CoV-2, [5] and also shorter than the reported 5\u00b70 days (IQR, 1\u00b70\u201310\u00b70) in another study of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. [2] Seven of the 34 operative patients (20\u00b76%) died of COVID-19 associated complications. This mortality rate is much higher than the reported overall case-fatality rate of 2\u00b73% in COVID-19 patients without surgery, [9] and also higher than the case-fatality rate of 7\u00b79% in noncardiac surgical patients without COVID-19 infection who were admitted to multidisciplinary ICU. [20] Furthermore, the average duration from the time of first symptom to death of the 7 non-survivors (8\u00b77 days, range 4 to 13 days) is apparently shorter than that reported previously. In the report of Huang and colleagues, [5] the median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.0 days (4.0\u20138.0) and to ICU admission was 10.5 days (8.0\u201317.0) and 6 patients (15% of the total of 41 cases studied) did not survive ICU. The study did not report the exact dates of patient death, but it is safe for us to say that the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was longer than 10.5 days and thus longer than that of the non-survivors in our study. In other words, it is highly likely that surgical stress occurred during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbated disease progression and severity.",

[25] In the report, a 61-year-old man who was electively admitted for cardiac bypass surgery and the patient's laboratory examinations were normal despite the history of hypertension and diabetes, and MERS-CoV test was negative before the surgery. However, this patient developed MERS-CoV infection-related symptom in the 2nd day after surgery, and was tested positive for MERS-CoV on post-operative day 6, and the patient passed away on post-operative day 9. Possibility exists that this patient could be a healthy carrier of MERS-CoV who then had the virus activated by the stress of surgery. For the patients included in our current study, we performed routine laboratory tests but did not specifically test for SARS-CoV-2 before surgery by use of quantitative RT-PCR with the CDC (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) recommended kit based on the considerations that these patients had no any sign of COVID-19 related symptoms and the CDC recommended kit was very limited and could only be used for highly suspected case of SARS-CoV-2 infection at that time. However, a thorough review of the patients' profile made us confident to believe that the 34 patients included in this study got infected before their hospital admission. We now retrospectively understand that it might be necessary and very important for a patient to be isolated for a certain period (such as the WHO recommended 14-days quarantine period) or the possibility of the new coronavirus infection being excluded before being considered for an elective surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

The sample size of the present study was small, as it was a rare situation and patients were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, the patients were not performed the specific SARS-CoV-2 confirmation test before surgery, due to the limited understanding of the epidemic situation and the shortage of SARS-CoV-2 kits at that time. Thus, our assumption of the intubation periods of the patients included the current study was mainly based on clinical profiles and routine laboratory tests. Nevertheless, it is our hope that the findings of the SARS-CoV-2 associated postoperative morbidity and mortality will alert the global community to be better prepared in the battle against COVID-19 infection.",
