            "text": "Chicken egg is widely used as food ingredients because of its nutritional and functional properties (Bragagnolo & Rodriguez-Amaya, 2003). However, chicken egg is also considered as a major source of antibodies. In the past few years, many kinds of specific antibodies have been yielded successfully from eggs of immunised hens, which include anti-HIV-1 and anti-SARS coronavirus antibodies (Devi et al., 2002, Fu et al., 2006, McLaren et al., 1994, Ruan et al., 2005, Soler et al., 1998). Presently, IgY has been used extensively for prevention and treatment of various infections in animals and humans with mixed success (Hamada & Kodama, 1996). Other potential uses of IgY in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics has been reported by many authors (Ambrosius and Hadge, 1987, Larsson and Sjoquist, 1988, Otake et al., 1991, Yokohama et al., 1992).",

The conventional techniques such as precipitation (Akita & Nakai, 1993), electrophoresis (Gee, Bate, Thomas, & Rylatt, 2003), and chromatography (Hansen et al., 1998, Tini et al., 2002, Verdoliva et al., 2000) have been used in the IgY separation and purification process. However, these conventional techniques are often time consuming and low yielding (Verdoliva et al., 2000). Therefore, there is a need to determine more efficient ways for IgY separation and purification, and these methods should also be economical and easily scaled up (Akita & Nakai, 1993).",

Recently UF has shown to be capable in separating proteins of similar sizes exploiting the difference in electrostatic charges. Extensive published papers (Fane et al., 1983, Liu et al., 2007, Musale and Kulkarni, 1997, Nakao et al., 1988, Palecek et al., 1992, Wan et al., 2002) have demonstrated that UF is an efficient method for protein concentration and fractionation without causing structural damage. Many protein mixtures even with close molecular weights (Wan, Vasan, Ghosh, Hale, & Cui, 2005) have been successfully separated using UF processes under optimised conditions.",

            "text": "\nFig. 1\nshows the experimental setup used for ultrafiltration in this study. The detailed description of the experimental apparatus has been given in our previous work (Lu et al., 2005, Wan et al., 2006). In brief, it consisted of two parts, a stirred cell for carrying out ultrafiltration and AKTA Prime Plus liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare, USA) for process control and monitoring. The stirred cell had a working volume of 16.0 mL and could be fitted with a membrane disk having an effective diameter of 24 mm. There was a suspended bar impeller with a diameter of 20 mm inside the module, which was magnetically driven by a RCT basic stirrer (IKA, Japan). The stirring speed was monitored using a digital photo/contact tachometer (RS 163-5348, RS Components). The gap between the impeller and the membrane was about 1.5 mm. The stirred cell was integrated with the AKTA Prime Plus in which a positive displacement pump was employed to ensure constant permeate flux through the membrane. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) was monitored by a pressure transducer. The protein solution was injected into the system in the form of pulse using a sample injector. Permeate was continuously monitored at 280 nm using a flow-through UV monitor. At the same time, the pH and conductivity of permeate were also monitored on line by a flow-through conductivity cell. All these data were continuously logged into a computer for storage and then were subsequently analysed using Prime View 5.00 software (Amersham Bioscience, GE Healthcare).",

At each parameter value two pulsed injection runs were performed. Each run lasted for 60 min after injection. The first run was done to ensure equilibrium adsorption of protein on the membrane surface at the given operating conditions and the data obtained from the second run was for the subsequent calculation. The experiment was repeated at least three times, and the data reported here are the average values.

In this experiment, stirring speed becomes a more important factor for IgY purification due to the serious membrane fouling at low stirring speed. For example, when the stirring speed was set to zero, the separation process had to be stopped at 12 min when the transmembrane pressure (TMP) exceeded the pressure limitation (1.0 MPa). Without stirring, ultrafiltration was carried out in a deadend operation. Sever concentration polarisation would soon lead to much increased osmotic pressure and gel layer formation. As the experiments were conducted at constant flux, the TMP would have to increase eventually to the operational limit. As expected, ultrafiltration of protein solutions would have to operate in crossflow mode, here with increased stirring speed. Concentration polarisation could be controlled, when the TMP is within an acceptable range.",

When the permeate flux increased from 39.8 to 53.1 L/m2\n h, IPA was totally rejected while the transmissions of IPB and IPC slightly decreased. According to the TMP value, the permeate flux of 26.5 L/m2\n h appears to be suitable for separation of IPA from IPB + IPC.",
