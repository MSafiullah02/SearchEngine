Such images typically show desiccated specimens and derive contrast from the accumulation of heavy metal negative stains, distorting the sample in the resulting image. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) avoids some of the drawbacks of negative staining by imaging frozen specimens preserved in a fully hydrated state in vitreous ice. Cryo-EM images typically derive contrast solely from the density of the imaged sample and the surrounding ice matrix. A limited analysis of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) imaged by cryo-EM has been previously reported. 1 In this report we present a more detailed description of the supramolecular design of three coronaviruses: SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and murine hepatitis virus (MHV).",

Cryo-EM has revealed that other pleomorphic viruses have a roughly spherical appearance, studded with projections that correspond to oligomers of the attachment and fusion protein. Examples include influenza virus [2] [3] [4] ; several retroviruses such as foamy virus, 5 human immunodeficiency virus, 6-10 murine leukemia virus, 11 and Rous sarcoma virus 12, 13 ; La Crosse virus 14, 15 ; Sendai virus 16 ; and Pichinde, Tacaribe, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses. 17 Based on single-particle image analysis of arenaviruses imaged by cryo-EM, we have proposed that pleomorphic arenavirus particles are constructed from overlapping paracrystalline lattices of proteins, and that these lattices span the viral membrane. 11 We hypothesized that coronaviruses may contain a similar supramolecular arrangement of proteins comprising a membrane-proximal scaffold. Here we used cryo-EM to examine the ultrastructure of a selection of coronaviruses representing two of the three proposed phylogenetic groups.",
