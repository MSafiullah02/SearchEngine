It is likely that COVID-19 appears to be a significant factor in the clinical course. Figure 1 shows a wide-complex tachycardia at rate of 134 beats per minute (bpm) and QRS width of 140 milliseconds (msec). P waves are noted at cycle length of 1200 msec (50 bpm) and AV dissociation is noted. This is consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and not a supraventricular rhythm with ST-elevation MI. The QRS morphology suggests origin from inferoseptal left ventricle. A junctional ectopic tachycardia with V-A block is also a less likely possibility. Figure 2 shows that a slower tachycardia (123 bpm) with QRS width of 148 msec. There is a significant loss of R wave across precordial leads and no discernible P-waves noted. Premature ventricular contractions are noted which appear to reset the tachycardia which could suggest a reentrant mechanism vs. fortuitous cycle length variation. There is no prior history of MI or Q waves in inferior leads. This is likely ventricular tachycardia originating from inferoapical left ventricular septum.",

(4) Acute viral myocarditis can be fulminant and may sometimes mimic acute MI and cause arrhythmias. (5) Patients with COVID-19 can deteriorate rapidly with shock and multi-organ failure. There are also reports suggesting significant cardiac injury and arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients (6, 7) . Fulminant myocarditis has been reported in COVID-19 patients (8) While it is possible that COVID-19 was a mere bystander in this patient, his history of COVID-19 related symptoms, acute respiratory failure, atypical EKG findings as well a precipitous course point towards myocarditis.",

Careful attention should be given to COVID-19 as a possible etiology and prophylactic personal protective equipment be used in patients presenting with suspected acute MI, acute heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias.",
