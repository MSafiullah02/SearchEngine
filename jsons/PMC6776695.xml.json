Furthermore, many human pathogens do not replicate in wild-type mice1,5,11\u201321. The availability of highly immunodeficient mouse strains allows for the creation of human/mouse chimeric models (humanized mice) that are locally or systemically reconstituted with human hematopoietic cells following engraftment of human tissues and/or stem cells. Humanized mice have been used to study human immune development and human-specific pathogens that replicate in human hematopoietic cells (for example, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus) and to test the efficacy of preventative and therapeutic agents5,11\u201319,22,23. Bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice are generated by bone marrow transplantation of immunodeficient mice implanted with autologous human thymus/liver tissue. BLT mice are systemically reconstituted with human innate (monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells) and adaptive (B and T cells) immune cells. The presence of a human thymic organoid in the BLT model allows for human T-cell education on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and the induction of HLA-restricted T-cell responses consistent with those observed in humans14,24,25.",

The human lung contains up to 40 different cell types including epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal and smooth muscle cells30 and it is an important natural site of pathogen replication9,26,31\u201334. We implanted human lung tissue subcutaneously into the back of immunodeficient mice to create humanized lung-only mice (LoM). The human lung tissue vascularizes, expands and persists as a human lung implant, and supports replication of viral and bacterial human pathogens in vivo. When incorporated into BLT mice (BLT-lung (BLT-L) mice), lung implants are repopulated with autologous human innate and adaptive immune cells. Direct inoculation of BLT-L human lung implants with HCMV induces HCMV-specific human IgM, IgG and T-cell responses which can effectively control infection in vivo. LoM and BLT-L mice expand the susceptibility of humanized mice to a broad range of human pathogens. These models can be used to study pathogen replication, pathogenesis, immune reactivity and human therapies.",

We injected cell-free HCMV TB40/E, a clinical HCMV strain, into the human lung implants of LoM. HCMV DNA was detected in the lung implants of LoM as early as 4 d postinoculation (mean 4.70 \u00d7 103 \u00b1 2.54 \u00d7 103 s.e.m. HCMV DNA copies per 105 cells; range 2.94 \u00d7 102\u20131.19 \u00d7 104 HCMV DNA copies per 105 cells) (Fig. 2k). HCMV immediate early (IE), early and late proteins were detected in lung implants at 14 d and 52 d postinoculation indicating that HCMV infection was maintained over time (Fig. 2l). The expression of IE proteins is consistent with lytic HCMV replication in this model as observed during human primary infection and reactivation42. In vivo, HCMV antigen was observed in human mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2m). We determined the effect of pre-exposure prophylaxis with ganciclovir (GCV) on HCMV replication in LoM. GCV was administered once daily 2 d before and 14 d after inoculation of HCMV TB40/E expressing luciferase (Fig. 2n). HCMV replication was monitored over time by measuring luciferase activity. By 4 d postexposure, HCMV levels were ~66% lower in the human lung implants of GCV-treated LoM (mean 3.36 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 1.61 \u00d7 105 s.e.m. radiance) compared with untreated controls (mean 1.00 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 2.90 \u00d7 105 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n). HCMV levels continued to decline over time in GCV-treated LoM. At the end of the GCV treatment course (14 d post-HCMV exposure), HCMV levels were ~2 logs lower in the lung implants of GCV-treated LoM (mean 1.48 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 4.96 \u00d7 104 s.e.m. radiance) compared with untreated LoM (mean 8.99 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 5.02 \u00d7 106 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n). Surprisingly, after GCV treatment was discontinued, HCMV levels continued to decline. By 25 d post-HCMV exposure (11 d after the last GCV dose), HCMV levels in the lung implants of GCV-treated LoM were further reduced by ~40% (mean 9.25 \u00d7 104 \u00b1 2.65 \u00d7 104 s.e.m. radiance) and significantly lower than untreated controls (mean 3.27 \u00d7 107 \u00b1 1.69 \u00d7 107 s.e.m. radiance) (Fig. 2n). Together, these results demonstrate the ability of LoM to sustain replication of several clinically relevant human pathogens and to serve as a platform for the in vivo testing of existing and novel antimicrobials.",

            "text": "In healthy individuals, HCMV establishes a life-long latent infection. In immune-suppressed individuals such as transplant and AIDS patients, HCMV can reactivate, resulting in uncontrolled lytic replication causing a multi-organ cytomegalovirus (CMV) syndrome43. Therefore, novel antivirals are needed that can inhibit HCMV lytic replication in vivo to ameliorate clinical symptoms of CMV disease. Since natural infections are typically asymptomatic and undiagnosed, the profile of HCMV genes expressed during lytic replication in vivo has not been determined on a genome-wide scale due to the difficulty of obtaining acutely infected samples. To define the complement of HCMV genes expressed in human tissue in vivo, we injected cell-free HCMV TB40/E into the human lung implants of LoM. HCMV double-stranded complementary DNA ((ds)cDNA) was enriched with biotinylated probes spanning both strands of the entire HCMV genome and next generation sequencing used to measure viral gene expression. Using this approach, we were able to measure the complement of viral genes expressed in vivo in human tissue during lytic replication. Results revealed widespread HCMV gene expression spanning the viral genome, consistent with robust lytic replication (Supplementary Fig. 4). Expression of known lytic genes encoding IE proteins IE1 (UL123) and IE2 (UL122), early proteins (UL44 and UL38), and late proteins pp65 (UL83) and pp71 (UL82) were detected. By contrast, expression of UL138, a well-characterized latency gene, was not observed. These results serve as proof-of-principle of the utility of LoM to investigate key aspects of HCMV replication in human lung tissue in vivo.",

HCMV replication was detectable in the human lung implants of LoM and BLT-L mice at 4 d postinoculation (Fig. 4a). In LoM, robust HCMV replication was maintained up to 5 weeks postinoculation (last time point analyzed) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, in BLT-L mice HCMV replication began to decline by 11 d postinoculation (Fig. 4a). Luciferase activity in BLT-L mice was significantly lower compared with LoM (Fig. 4a). HCMV replication in BLT-L mice continued to decline over time (Fig. 4a). Specifically, luciferase activity in the human lung implants of BLT-L mice at week 4 (mean 5.10 \u00d7 104 \u00b1 2.25 \u00d7 104 s.e.m. radiance; range 2.68 \u00d7 104\u20138.4 \u00d7 104 radiance) and week 5 (mean 6.46 \u00d7 104 \u00b1 8.08 \u00d7 103 s.e.m. radiance; range 5.5 \u00d7 104\u20137.47 \u00d7 104 radiance) postinoculation approached baseline levels (mean 2.34 \u00d7 104 radiance) and was significantly lower compared with LoM (Fig. 4a).

Brightness and contrast were adjusted on whole images using ImageJ software (version 1.51C). In Fig. 2b,d,h,m, pseudocoloring was used to depict MERS-CoV, ZIKV, RSV and HCMV antigens in green and human cell types in magenta. In Figs. 1i,j and 2i and Supplementary Fig. 1b, where red/green fluorescent images were originally captured, the red fluorescent signal was digitally altered to improve visualization by color-blind readers by adjusting the red channel hue by \u221245 using Adobe Photoshop (CS6).",

Filled symbols show positive responses and open symbols indicate negative responses. TB40/E open squares and circles represent mice in cohorts D and F, respectively; AD169 open squares and circles represent mice in cohorts D and E, respectively. f, Repeated TB40/E (top panels representative of measurements in four independent BLT-L mice) and AD169 (bottom panels representative of measurements in four independent BLT-L mice) exposure induced high frequencies of HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells as determined by pentamer reactivity.
