Recommendations on the face mask use varied greatly between countries and dynamically changed over time causing confusion in the general public (Feng et al., 2020) . Lin et al. (2020) pointed out that Google searches for \"face mask\" reached an all-time high interest since February, which could be a sign of anxiety appearing in the society. The reasoning behind wearing masks has been widely discussed in relation to accessibility, utilization and blocking human-to-human transmission when worn by symptomatic patients and healthcare providers (Feng et al. 2020) . However, the effect of such restriction on mental wellbeing remains unknown. Nevertheless, it seems that it may be an important topic of current research as it is the visual consequence of a pandemic that is present in the everyday lives of most people. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the association between implementation of face mask restrictions in Poland (on 16 th April, 2020) and psychopathological manifestation.",

We obtained general sociodemographic characteristics that included age, sex, employment status and place of residence. Psychopathological manifestation was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) that consists of 28 questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale illustrating the frequency of specific symptoms experiences over preceding 4 weeks (Makowska and Merecz, 2001) . Scores of specific items are grouped into four subscales: somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression. After data collection, participants were divided into two subgroups, i.e. those participating in the survey before and after implementation of face mask restrictions in Poland. The Ethics Committee at Wroclaw Medical University, Poland approved the study protocol. The categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. In turn, continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test due to non-normal distribution. The analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was performed to test for the association between face mask restrictions and psychopathological symptoms after adjustment for the effects of age, sex, working time and place of residence. Results of all analyses were considered significant if the p-value was less than 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).",

Our study emphasized the overall decrease in psychopathological symptoms after the obligation to wear face coverings in a public space. These findings are consistent with another study from China, which was focused on the relationship between the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of people returning to work during the pandemic (Tan et al., 2020) . The researchers concluded that several factors might significantly reduce the likelihood of the psychiatric symptoms and one of which was wearing the face masks in a workplace. On one hand, such behaviour might reinforce people's sense of personal control and, while being a certain stage of adaptation, mitigate helplessness (Folkman and Greer, 2000) and moderate anxiety, which includes strengthening individual coping resources. On the other hand, this measure is seen as a symbol of social cohesion in the global response to the pandemic (Cheng et al., 2020 ) that shifts the focus from self to the other and improve the collective responsibility (Shen, 2020) . It may also affect the improvement of wellbeing and reduction of negative emotional consequences (Reger et al., 2020 , Misiak et al., 2020 .",
