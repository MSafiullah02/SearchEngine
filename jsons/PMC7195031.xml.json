The most frequent viruses seen in primary care are influenza viruses A/B, rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [1,2]. In the hospital setting, adults with ILI are commonly tested only for influenza, resulting in limited data concerning other respiratory viruses. The use of multiplex RT-PCR allows identification of multiple viruses simultaneously but remains a second-line test in non-immunocompromised patients in emergency departments because of its cost and the limited therapeutic options [3].",
