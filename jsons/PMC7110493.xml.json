ET yields 3D structures by computationally combining a large number of 2D images of the object. The resolution is in the nanometer range and, therefore, in principle lower than in other 3D-EM techniques (e.g. electron crystallography, single-particle methods). However, the primary advantage of ET is that averaging is not a pre-requisite and thus unique (pleomorphic) structures such as organelles and cells can be unraveled. Hence, electron tomography enables an exploration of the 3D cellular world with unprecedented detail. This greatly enriches our insight not only into cellular architecture but also into the macromolecular machinery of the cell, which can now be revealed in situ.",

            "text": "The particular type of angular sampling in a tilt series (i.e. around one axis) is responsible for a prominent feature of the electron tomograms: their anisotropic resolution. The resolution is best in the direction of the tilt axis (x), and worse in the other two orthogonal directions (y and z). Additional effects arise from the fact that, the maximum tilt angle in ET is typically limited to \u223c\u00b165\u201370\u00b0. The most fundamental reason for this is the flat extended geometry typical of biological samples (e.g. a cell section) which makes the effective specimen thickness increase above permissible values at high-tilt angles. Therefore, high-tilt projection images are missing, which leads to the problem commonly referred to as the \u2018missing wedge\u2019. The name originates from the wedged shape of a region without information that becomes apparent when the problem is examined in Fourier space. In the tomogram, the \u2018missing wedge\u2019 results in a deterioration of the resolution in z, the direction along the specimen \u2018depth\u2019 (i.e. parallel to the optical axis) [16], [18]. Features appear elongated in this direction and thus, for example, a spherical object will appear ellipsoidal in the reconstruction.",

Crowther's equation is often used as a reference: d\n = \n\u03c0D/N, where d is resolution, D the diameter of the object and N the number of projections [21], [22]. Nevertheless, this expression is only valid for spherical or cylindrical objects and a complete angular coverage that, as mentioned above, is not attained in practice. Specific mathematic formulations for missing information as well as for other sample and tilting geometries have been derived [16], [18]. Nonetheless, Crowther's equation, in which D is often substituted by the sample thickness, remains being used as a rough guide to the resolution limits of a particular experiment. This equation conveys in a simple way two important notions. First, the influence of the specimen thickness on the attainable resolution: for the same number of projections, thinner objects are better resolved. Second, it highlights the rather intuitive idea that resolution can be improved by a larger number of projections (i.e. smaller angular increments). In practice, however, there are limitations that cannot be overcome by collecting more projection images. Note that the considerations so far only describe the influence of angular sampling on the attainable resolution leaving out other factors such as the amount and nature of the recorded signal, or the structural preservation of the specimen. In this regard, the sample preparation method is a major determinant and deserves specific attention.",

            "text": "Studying biological samples by TEM raises specific challenges due to the particular environment inside the electron microscope and the imaging requirements. For example, water is the major component of biological material, and yet liquid samples do not tolerate the vacuum conditions inside the microscope column. The low intrinsic contrast of biological material and its sensitivity to the highly ionizing electron beam create additional difficulties. Also, the fact that sufficient electrons have to penetrate the sample to produce an image restricts the maximum sample thickness to values that, even for high voltage electron microscopes, are well below the thickness of most eukaryotic cells. Over the last decades, a large variety of preparative techniques have been devised to address these problems. These methods can be roughly divided into two categories and reflect opposite ways to deal with aqueous samples: in one, the water is removed and in the other, it is vitrified into solid amorphous water.",

For samples such as macromolecular complexes or viruses, water can be rapidly removed by blotting and drying (e.g. negative staining [23]). Larger specimens, such as whole cells or tissue, need to be fixed first in order to endure the dehydration process. After fixation (conventionally by chemical fixation with cross-linkers) and dehydration, samples are infiltrated with a plastic resin that, once polymerized, hardens the sample allowing sectioning with an ultramicrotome into slices thin enough for EM (\u223c50\u2013500 nm). All these methods make use of heavy metals that stain the sample to increase its contrast. Details into the multiple protocols available abound and can be found in, for example, [24].",

            "text": "Although conventional approaches have proven their usefulness over the years, removal of a key substance like water does raise concerns. This led in the 1980s to the development of an alternative method which has come to be known as cryo-electron microscopy [25], [26]. In cryo-EM, the specimen is maintained in its hydrated native state by vitrifying the water into an amorphous (glass-like) solid. The samples have to be kept below the devitrification temperature of water (\u223c\u2212135 \u00b0C) throughout all handling steps, including TEM imaging. For sample preparation, high cooling rates are necessary to prevent the formation of ice crystals that would damage the biological structures. Plunging into a liquid cryogen (e.g. liquid ethane) provides cooling rates that are sufficient to vitrify water to a depth of about \u223c1 \u03bcm [26]. Complete vitrification of thicker samples usually requires additional measures. The most widely used method is high-pressure freezing (HPF) [27]: after a few milliseconds during which pressure is raised to \u223c2000 bar, rapid cooling proceeds. In this manner, samples up to \u223c100\u2013300 \u03bcm thick can be vitrified [28], [29]. Subsequently, vitreous sections (\u223c25\u2013100 nm thick) have to be cut with a cryo-ultramicrotome [30], [31]. Sectioning vitrified samples is a very demanding process and not exempt of artifacts [32], such as compression and crevasses that become particularly severe in sections thicker than \u223c100 nm. Recently, focused-ion beam (FIB) milling has shown to be an effective alternative in thinning cryo-samples [33]. The method consists in using a focused beam of ions (usually Ga2+) to erode the sample until it reaches the desired thickness. The bulk of the material is lost in the process; however, the result is a thin slab of sample without sectioning artifacts. FIB milling could thus replace cryo-sectioning in those cases where sacrificing most of the material does not prevent the study of the target structures.",

The temperature is gradually increased and the sample embedded in a plastic resin. The final outcome of HPF\u2013FS is a block of material that can be further processed by conventional methods and where an improved ultrastructural preservation is often apparent.",

This being undoubtedly true, other factors might need to be pondered. A fundamental problem of cryo-ET is radiation damage since the samples are rapidly destroyed by the electron beam. Depending on the specimen and the target resolution, the permissible incident electron dose for imaging is restricted to \u223c2500\u201315,000 electrons/nm2. The low dose and the reduced contrast of unstained biological samples result in images and, henceforth, tomograms with a very poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that are rarely straightforward to analyze before applying denoising algorithms [36], [37]. Radiation damage limits the available information per volume element of the specimen, and thus poses a physical limit to the resolution that cryo-ET can directly attain, which has been estimated to be at around 2 nm [38]. It should be noted, though, that high-resolution features are preserved in the sample. Therefore, when multiple identical copies of a structure are present in the cryotomogram(s), averaging techniques should in principle allow surpassing this limit.",

Here, we would like to focus on dose fractionation and specimen thickness. In cryo-ET the limited permissible dose should be fractioned over as many images as possible. Nevertheless, fractionation reaches a limit when the counting statistics in the individual images is so poor that the alignments would become inaccurate. This also hampers dual-axis cryo-ET, as a second tilt series would imply an additional fractionation of the dose by a factor of two. The problem becomes more important for thicker samples where the transmitted signal becomes even weaker. As the sample thickness increases so does the probability of multiple scattering (electrons that interact more than once with the sample) and inelastic scattering (electrons that lose energy in the interaction), which reduce the image quality [39]. Inelastically scattered electrons can be removed by an energy filter but, eventually, the remaining fraction of electrons is so small that the images become too noisy. As practical compromises, a rougher angular sampling and/or lower magnification can be used but, in any case, the outcome will be cryotomograms with lower resolution.",

Actually, the sections are pre-irradiated before data collection with doses as high as 107\n electrons/nm2. Pre-irradiation is used to stabilize the sample by going beyond an initial phase in which the plastic shrinks quite rapidly under the electron beam [40]. Although the dose is not a major resolution limit for plastic sections, other factors need to be considered. The presence of artifacts induced during the sample preparation cannot be discarded and should be critically evaluated in the analysis of the tomograms. The aforementioned shrinkage, which thins plastic sections by up to \u223c40% [40], represents an extra distortion that cannot be ignored. A third an even more fundamental problem is the fact that the visualized material is the stain and not the original biological constituents. Therefore, the real limit is not the nominal achievable resolution, but the nature and faithfulness of the retrieved information. Overall, electron tomography of stained samples has shown to provide useful information in the 3\u20137 nm resolution range.",

The contrast and SNR are higher in the section but, in the cryotomogram, the virion constituents (lipid membrane, proteins and RNA) and directly visualized. Thus, the cryotomogram allows a more reliable interpretation in terms of macromolecular organization of the particle [41]. Tomograms of stained sections, on the other hand, are very useful to ascertain general structural features and reveal topological changes associated with the virus life cycle [42].

This is sometimes enough to encompass complete subcellular structures or significant parts of them. Their 3D morphology, unraveled by ET, has often substantially altered previous structure/function models. One paradigmatic example is the tomographic study of the mitochondria in the 1990s [46]. The 3D reconstructions revealed a cristae organization that considerably diverged from the one depicted in the textbooks and that had decisive functional consequences [47]. Since those early days, a large variety of subcellular structures have been examined by ET (e.g. chloroplast [48], multivesicular bodies [49], melanosomes [50], the Golgi apparatus [51], [52], [53], [54], and microtubule-related structures [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61]). This type of characterization is illustrated in Fig. 3\n. In this study, ET was used to analyze the structure of Weibel\u2013Palade Bodies (WPBs), a specialized secretory organelle in endothelial cells that contains polymers of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). In response to vascular injury, vWF is released into the blood stream where it plays a key role in blood clotting. ET showed that each organelle stores vWF in bundles of individual twisting tubules that are regularly spaced (Fig. 3). These structural features provided functional insight into the possible mechanisms of vWF packaging and extrusion [62].",

This is particularly helpful to analyze complex samples with multiple cellular structures (e.g. [52], [61]). Whereas the projection TEM images might be difficult to interpret, the corresponding tomograms show to be very helpful in revealing the individual components as well as the contacts and connections among them. This information furthers our understanding of the interplay between different subcellular structures involved in many biological processes. An example is presented in Fig. 4\n. In this study [42], ET was applied to investigate the cellular membrane modifications induced by SARS-coronavirus infection (SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome), which are associated with the viral RNA replication and transcription. Conventional electron microscopy had described these structures as individual double-membrane vesicles. The tomograms showed that, far from being isolated structures, these vesicles are interconnected, and also linked to large assemblies of convoluted membranes and to the endoplasmic reticulum. The new picture that emerged from these results is that of a unique and elaborate reticulovesicular network of modified membranes, \u2018hijacked\u2019 from the endoplasmic reticulum to accommodate viral RNA synthesis [42]. Essential topological features have been revealed in a similar way for other viral system (e.g. flock-house virus [63], dengue virus [64]), bringing ET to the front line of the ultrastructural study of virus life cycle.",

This large-scale imaging can be instrumental in cases in which both detail and overview are necessary. An example is the study of the microtubule cytoskeleton in fission yeast (Fig. 5\n) [65]. The reconstruction of large cellular volumes was crucial to fully track the microtubules, whereas resolution was needed to reveal detailed structural features such as the architecture of the microtubule ends. The results provided insight not only into the microtubule cytoskeleton organization but also into its interactions with other organelles and led the authors to propose a model for microtubule bundles architecture and nucleation.",

Therefore, thin specimens (up to \u223c50\u2013200 nm) are especially favorable and provide the highest level of detail. Multiple biological structures falling into this size category have been analyzed by cryo-ET (e.g. macromolecular complexes like bacterial polysomes [69] and small organelle-like structures such as carboxysomes [70], [71]). The study of viral structures, also in this size range, is one of the areas on which cryo-ET is having a particular impact. Traditionally, 3D-EM was reserved to highly regular viral elements (e.g. icosahedral capsids) for which single-particle averaging methods were applicable. However, a whole range of viruses, either pleomorphic in nature or with pleomorphic components, escaped this analysis. The study of herpes simplex virus by cryo-ET [72] inaugurated a very active line of research which is providing new insight into viral structure. Examples illustrating this field include the reconstruction of vaccinia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus and coronavirus particles [41], [73], [74], [75].",

The role of these particles remains to be elucidated but it is interesting to note that cryo-ET enabled their detection since these small luminal densities would be indistinguishable in the corresponding projection images.",

Examples of applications include the investigation of mitochondria, microtubules and the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells [93], [94], [95], [96] as well as the study of bacterial chromatin organization [97] and the outer membrane of mycobacteria [98]. Since the technique produces essentially thin sections (25\u2013100 nm), the total amount of reconstructed volume is relatively small, which might be a drawback for some specific questions. On the other hand, the thinness results in tomograms with an impressive level of detail. Thus, even in those cases when whole mount samples can be studied, cryo-sectioning might become the methodology of choice when the highest resolution is required for the specific question at hand [99]. A striking recent application is presented in Fig. 8\n. The goal of this work was the elucidation of the cadherin-based architecture of desmosomes, a type of intercellular junction present in tissues such as skin and heart. The study included cryo-ET on cryo-sections, averaging and classification of subtomograms, and fitting of the X-ray structure of a closely related cadherin. The results revealed a highly packed organization of the cadherins in a quasi-periodical arrangement with alternating cis and trans interactions, which allowed the proposal of a detailed model for desmosome formation and maturation [100].",

The first is a necessity for those approaches that pursue large-scale ET (e.g. serial-section ET), but also a general requirement to sustain observations on statistical grounds. Advances in large-scale automation as well as in tools for the processing, analysis, and storage of large amounts of data (e.g. [68], [101], [102], [103]) are essential for the expansion of ET. One of the current \u2018bottlenecks\u2019 in ET is the availability of faster detectors that provide a better signal, the latter being essential to increase the resolution of cryotomograms. The new generation of detectors promises significant progress in this respect [104], [105]. Another effective way of improving resolution is by classification and averaging. Both are the basis of single-particle approaches but their implementation in ET faces specific problems due to anisotropic resolution of the reconstructions. Subtomograms are prone to be aligned and classified according to the position of the \u2018missing wedge\u2019 instead of attending to intrinsic differences in orientation and structure. Recent developments that take into account the missing information make it foreseeable an extension of averaging applications in ET [106], [107], [108].",

Exciting new developments towards alternative methods are based on the use of quantum dots [112], fluorophores that can induce osmium deposition [113], [114], and clonable protein tags that bind heavy metals [115]. The availability of labels that can be observed with both light and electron microscopy has stimulated new efforts towards correlative light\u2013electron microscopy (see Brown et al. in this issue). Considerable progress has been made in this direction and even a single instrument combining both types of microscopes in one has been implemented [116].

The TEM\u2013ET methods covered in this review always face the limiting factor of the thickness suitable for TEM imaging. The reconstruction of a whole average eukaryotic cell requires a large number of serial sections and is still a titanic task. Therefore, those techniques that can image larger volumes at once are of special interest. Some of them make use of other imaging modes that are available in many transmission electron microscopes. These include different varieties of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (i.e. bright-field STEM, dark-field STEM of high angle annular dark-field STEM) [117], [118], [119], or most-probable loss imaging [120]. Other techniques aim at even larger structures and use different instrumentation. One of them is soft-X-ray tomography, which allows to survey depths up to \u223c10 \u03bcm and can thus be used to reconstruct entire cells [121]. Recent applications of this technique to frozen hydrated sample have reached resolutions in the 50 nm range [122], [123], [124]. Another promising methodology is serial-section scanning electron microscopy. Here, successive layers are removed from a block of material, either with a built-in ultramicrotome or with a focused-ion beam, and the fresh block-face is sequentially imaged by scanning electron microscopy. In this way, volumes that reach several hundreds of \u03bcm3 have been recently mapped [125].",

The current developments in ET and the emergence of novel 3D techniques that expand ET size boundaries make us anticipate an exciting period for structural and cell biologists. It will become increasingly common to address specific biological questions with combined approaches that span different resolution and scale levels. Such integrated strategies will require proper linking of information, a task in which ET is bound to play a central role, and will give a new direction to the way we explore and understand the cellular world.",

For example, in the 0\u00b0 projection image of this specimen, the small tubule and the small vesicle have similar profiles and it is not possible to ascertain whether the four individual objects are separated in the third dimension. These ambiguities can be resolved by collecting images of the specimen from different directions, which is the basic principle of ET. (B) During ET data collection, the specimen is projected at different tilt angles into a series of 2D images (continuous arrows). The back-projection algorithm essentially reverses this process in the computer. Each recorded image is smeared out along the projection direction (discontinuous arrows), and their added contribution yields a 3D representation of the specimen: the tomogram.",
