            "text": "Qing Dai, a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is the pale blue to grayish-blue dried powder prepared by a traditional fermentation process (Lee et al., 2019; Lin, 2016; Pan et al., 2018). Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis (Naganuma, 2019; Sugimoto et al., 2016). The aerial part of Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze (Acanthaceae) recorded in Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopeia is the one of candidate materials that have been used to manufacture Qing Dai (Lee et al., 2019; Lin, 2016). The crude extracts and pure phytochemicals of S. cusia leave (Da-Ching-Yeh or Nan-Ban-Lan-Yeh) and root (Na-Ban-Lan-Gen) showed many pharmacological properties, including anti-viral (anti-herpes simplex virus type-1, anti-influenza A virus), anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and antipyretic effects (Feng et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2003; Honda and Tabata, 1979; Tanaka et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2017). To date many secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, sterols, lignans, phenylethanoids, and isocoumarin have been isolated from this species (Feng et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2015; Honda and Tabata, 1979; Tanaka et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2017). However, interleukin 17 (IL-17) inhibitions of S. cusia and its processed drug, Qing Dai are not known. Qing Dai could provide a highly effective approach for not only psoriasis (topical use), but inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (oral use) in modern clinical therapy (Lee et al., 2019; Sugimoto et al., 2016). In addition, Qing Dai ointment could significantly reverse the IL-17A gene expression in psoriatic skin lesions in our previous studies (Cheng et al., 2017). Therefore, Qing Dai and its anti-IL-17 components are interesting for us and this TCM is needed to clarify the active phytochemicals for further clinical application. Our previous investigation indicated that indole alkaloids could contribute to anti-IL-17 properties of Qing Dai that was prepared from the aerial parts of S. cusia (Lee et al., 2019). Continuing studies on bioactive constituents of Qing Dai resulted in isolation of two compounds; besides, their IL-17 inhibitory effects and possible biogenetic pathways of active components were also discussed within.",

IR absorptions at 3319, 1697, and 1682 cm\u22121 supported the presence of NH and carbonyl groups, respectively. Other IR absorptions at 1605, 1487, and 1462 cm\u22121 indicated an aromatic system. The UV spectra showed absorption maxima at 260 and 398 nm. In 1D NMR spectra (Table 1), twenty-eight carbon signals were observed, which agreed with two methyls, one methylene, thirteen methines, and twelve quaternary carbons. Among the twelve quaternary carbons, three were identified as carbonyl carbons on the basis of chemical shifts at \u03b4 197.4, 199.9, and 200.3.1D NMR, HSQC, and COSY data also indicated the presence of three sets of o-disubstituted benzene rings, one at \u03b4H/\u03b4C 6.31 (d, J = 7.5 Hz)/114.6, 6.92 (t, J = 7.5 Hz)/121.2, 7.33 (t, J = 7.5 Hz)/136.5, 7.53 (d, J = 7.5 Hz)/124.3, another at \u03b4H/\u03b4C 6.88 (t, J = 7.5 Hz)/119.7, 6.94 (d, J = 7.5 Hz)/112.1, 7.53 (d, J = 7.5 Hz)/124.5, 7.59 (t, J = 7.5 Hz)/139.6, and the other at \u03b4 6.74 (t, J = 7.5 Hz)/118.1, 6.75 (d, J = 7.5 Hz)/111.9, 7.39 (t, J = 7.5 Hz)/137.8 and 7.60 (d, J = 7.5 Hz)/124.7. The MS and NMR data of 1 were similar to those of indigodole A (Lee et al., 2019), except that 1 has an ethyl moiety instead of methyl group in indigodole A. On the basis of HMBC [\u03b4H 0.74 (H3-2\u2034)/\u03b4C 27.7 (C-1\u2034) and 82.9 (C-2), \u03b4H 2.15, 2.38 (H2-1\u2034)/\u03b4C 7.6 (C-2\u2034), 74.2 (C-2\u2033), 82.9 (C-2), and 199.9 (C-3)] and COSY correlations [\u03b4 2.15, 2.38 (H2-1\u2034)/0.74 (H3-2\u2034)], the ethyl group was assigned at C-2 (\u03b4 82.9) (Fig. 2\n). In the HMBC spectrum, the methyl protons at \u03b4 0.67 (3H, d) exhibited 2\nJ interactions with C-1\u2034\u2032 (\u03b4 52.1) as well as 3\nJ interactions with C-2\u2033 (\u03b4 74.2) and C-2\u2032 (\u03b4 85.9). Additionally, the methine proton \u03b4 3.64 had HMBC correlations with C-2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4 7.3), C-2\u2033 (\u03b4 74.2), C-2\u2032 (\u03b4 85.9), C-3\u2033 (\u03b4 197.4), and C-3\u2032 (\u03b4 200.3). These and other key HMBC connections are shown in Fig. 2. The NOESY spectrum showed the correlations of NH-1\u2033/H3-2\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 and H-1\u2033\u2032\u2032/NH-1\u2032, H2-1\u2034 (Fig. 3\n) and the relative configurations of 1 were temporarily determined as \u03b2\u2013NH\u20131\u2032, \u03b1\u2013NH\u20131\u2033, \u03b2\u2013CH2\u20131\u2034, and \u03b1\u2013CH3\u20132\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032.

In the proposed mechanisms (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, S18), indole will be oxidized to indolone, cytochrome P-450 (Cyt P-450) is a monooxygenase for oxidation, acetyl-CoA could offer ethyl group, and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) will give hydrogen for reduction reaction. The plausible biogenetic mechanisms of active indigodoles A, C, and D are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9\n, respectively, in addition, those of indirubin, tryptanthrin, and indigodole B, that a tryptanthrin derivative without anti-IL-17 property in our previous investigation, are shown in Fig. S18.",

But their active components were reported only rarely and we believe they are worthy of more investigations. In this study, two indole alkaloids, including new indigodole D (1), were obtained from Qing Dai and both isolates showed inhibition against IL-17A gene expression, especially 1 also showed dose-dependent inhibition on IL-17A protein production. Besides, indole alkaloids indigodole A, indigodole C, tryptanthrin, and indirubin could contribute to the anti-IL-17A properties of Qing Dai as well. The possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles were also speculated by us and could provide valuable information for medicinal chemists to make more active Qing Dai indole analogues. Structure-activity relationships and IL-17 mechanism of action will be needed to further evaluate and clearly clarify for further clinical application.",
