This immune overreaction, called a cytokine storm, can lead to multiorgan failure and death (Tisoncik et al., 2012) . For example, Influenza A (H5N1) has been shown to activate the TNFa-driven NFkB signaling pathway in a mouse host during viral infection generating a cytokine storm (Schmolke et al., 2009) . As anticipated, inhibitors of NFkB acutely suppress cytokine storm and increase survival in a mouse model of SARS CoV infection (DeDiego et al., 2014) . Recent data show that COVID-19 also activates NFkB (Guo et al., 2020) . Cytokine storm marks the airways of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with more severe disease . Since there are multiple strains of influenza as well as coronavirus, there might be an advantage to develop therapies that suppress host-induced cytokine storm, in addition to developing strain-specific vaccines.",

The absence of NFkB inhibitory drugs from the human formulary is due to most candidate drugs being either neurotoxic or nephrotoxic when administered chronically (Zhang et al., 2017) . One drug that lacks these toxicities is the cardiac glycoside digitoxin. We have previously shown digitoxin to be among the most potent inhibitors of the proinflammatory TNFa/NFkB pathway in the human airway and in other epithelial cells, both in vitro (Srivastava et al., 2004), and in vivo (Zeitlin et al., 2017; Pollard et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) . Corroborating this is a screen of 2800 drugs and bioactive compounds which found digitoxin to be the 2nd most potent inhibitor of TNFa/NFkB activity (Miller et al., 2011) . Digitoxin has been a drug to treat heart failure for decades, and is safe for children and adults with normal hearts (Hoffman and Bigger, 1990) . In a clinical trial of digitoxin administered to young adults with the proinflammatory lung disease cystic fibrosis, digitoxin was safe. The study showed \"the mRNAs encoding chemokine/cytokine or cell surface receptors in immune cells were decreased in nasal epithelial cells...leading to pathway-mediated reductions in IL-8, IL-6, lung epithelial inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and mucus hypersecretion.\" (Zeitlin et al., 2017) .",

The digitoxin-dependent reductions are specific and saturating for each cytokine, but do not reduce any of them to zero. Table 1 shows that the greatest significant digitoxin-dependent reductions in cytokine proteins were found for IFNg (68.9%), GRO/KC (46.6%), and MCP1 (54.9%). Smaller but still significant reductions in cytokine proteins were found for MIP2 (32.2%) and TNFa (38.4%).

There is an early phase, from 6 hours after infection on day 1 to day 6, which may reflect the presence of activated NK cells. The late phase, from day 6 to day 28, may be the product of incoming antigen-specific T cells. Importantly, simply neutralizing INFg in a mouse model of infection with influenza A virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1v; \"Swine Flu\") is sufficient to not only alleviate acute lung injury but also to increase weight and survival rate (Liu et al., 2019) . Reduced IFNg is associated with reduced TNFa and NFkB activation. The data also show that digitoxin treatment causes the most profound reduction in INFg expression. It is further known that IFNg expression is driven by a combination of both NFkB and NFAT (Sica et al., 1997) . As summarized in Figure 2 , digitoxin not only reduces NFkB expression, but also reduces NFAT through digitoxin-dependent activation of Caspase 3 (Yang et al., 2013b) .",
