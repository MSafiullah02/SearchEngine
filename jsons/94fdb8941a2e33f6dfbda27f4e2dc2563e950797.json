In this work we emphasize the interesting role of structural holes as brokers for information propagation. Based on the distribution of the structural hole numbers associated with each node, we propose a simple yet effective approach for choosing the most influential nodes to immunize in containing the spreading processes. Using a wide spectrum of large real-world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in a remarkable way. In particular, we find that the performance gains of our approach are particularly prominent for networks with high transitivity and assortativity, which verifies the vital role of structural holes in information diffusion on networked systems.",

Based on the fact that a complex system consists of many mutually interacting components, the interaction among components and how they intertwine can be captured by a graph, where nodes correspond to individual components and edges to their interactions. Such a network can be thought of as a backbone of the complex system along which signals, information, and contagious entities propagate. In real-world networks, however, undesirable signals can also spread through networks. For example, malicious rumors can spread among individuals, computer worms deluge the internet, and epidemic diseases can infect vulnerable people through contact. Hence, developing effective strategies for preventing the spreading of harmful signals through a network is a research challenge of both theoretical and practical importance.",

Therefore, pursuing an exact solution to influence minimization for large-scale networks suffers from combinatorial explosion. Alternatively, a number of efficient approaches are proposed to approximately solve the problem [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These solutions can be classified into two categories: (i) optimization-based methods; for example, by using the greedy heuristic climbing algorithm, the result * Corresponding author: dping.li@gmail.com of Kempe et al. [9] shows that it can approximate the optimum to within a factor of 1 \u2212 1/e (where e is the base of the natural logarithm); and (ii) structure-based approaches, typically inspired by the relatedness between the topology and functionality of networks, such as those topology based heuristic methods including [4, 5] . Compared with the optimizationbased algorithms, heuristics approaches are computationally much more efficient and thus more practical in a diversity of networked systems. Therefore, it is of particular interest to devise efficient methods by leveraging the information of the structures of complex networks.",

The property of scale-free degree distribution reflects the allocation of one kind of social capital, from the viewpoint of social network analysis, i.e., a few hub nodes in such networks have a disproportionally large number of interaction partners while the majority of nodes are connected only to just a handful of relations. In other words, to some extent the degree of a node represents the importance of that node in the whole network. Identifying important nodes [17] is of great significance for infection control. In previous works [18] [19] [20] , heuristic methods based on degrees have been proved to be more efficient than random strategies in selecting candidate nodes to vaccinate. However, node degree only captures network property at low orders, while control information spreading paths of networks obviously requires higher-order information on networks. This is why the degree-based methods are not always optimal.",

Considering that information often travels across the shortest paths of a network, it is clear that the more paths pass through a node, the more important that node should be. In this sense, betweenness centrality [21] is an appropriate measure for quantifying the importance of a node. While betweenness has wide applications in many networks, it fails to show superiority compared to degree-based methods [3] . The reason lies in the assumptions that information transfers follow shortest paths, while spreading processes expand more randomly in real-world situations. Further, though betweenness centrality considers the indirect influence of high-order neighbors of the nodes, the infection occurring in the ego networks of the infected has no immediate relation to distant nodes. Ego betweenness [22, 23] defines node importance at the local level, but as it is highly correlated with global betweenness centrality, the immunization effects resulting from the two betweenness-based strategies are nearly the same.",

Usually it is insufficient to apply only an individual importance indicator to characterize the role of a node in spreading processes. A reasonable solution is to apply multiple indicators to evaluate the importance of a node and identify its role [24] . However, determining the weightings of respective metrics in the composite measure is an open problem. Besides, some metrics such as betweenness centrality are computationally expensive for large-scale networks. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we design a simple metric, which we call structural hole count (SHC), to capture the roles of a node from multiple facets. This metric is then applied to contain spreading processes modeled in a number of real-world networks. Remarkable improvements on the efficiency of the containing strategy are found through numerical simulations. To further understand properties of this indicator, we also inspect its relationship to existing network metrics. Our findings indicate that the structural hole count achieves a combined effect of the degree correlation and clustering coefficients simultaneously in containing spreading processes.",

They act as structural hole spanners to fill the holes among the people or group without direct connections. For example, as shown in Fig. 1 , there are four structural holes marked by dashed blue arrows associated with the ego node. For each structural hole, the nodes in it will never have the chance to communicate with each other upon the removal of the ego node. Obviously, the ego node plays an important role in the information propagation and the higher the number of structural holes associated with it, the more important the role is.

However, less attention has been drawn in applying this measurement in network analysis. In this work, we extend the idea to general networks and reveal its important role in spread control.",

Thus one can take arbitrary positive values less than 1 in the experiment. Here we use \u03bb = 0.05, but other nonzero values were found to give similar results. Figure 2 shows the contamination degree of the resulting networks as a function of the number of nodes blocked k, using different schemes as discussed above. We can see that the proposed method outperforms other methods in that the average contamination degree declines more rapidly over k. More specifically, the expected contamination degree is reduced to almost zero by blocking about 14% of the nodes with the proposed method in the astroph network (Fig. 2) . In contrast, by blocking the same number of nodes, the contamination degree is still more than 50% for the degreebased method. Overall, the performances of random schemes (both random sampling and random walk) are inferior; the NDeg method can outperform the degree-based method, indicating the importance of the highest-degree neighbors, and our approach always outperforms other competing methods in these large-scale networks. Another observation is that the performance of the random walk method is inferior to the degree-based method in these networks, which seems to be different from the observations made in [28] .",

In other words, it equivalently takes into account multiple indicators in containing the spreading processes. We believe this is attributed to the interesting relation between the structural hole counts and various network characteristics. In highly transitive networks, the neighbors of a node are heavily interconnected and form a dense local cluster with their ego, while the nodes that span plenty of structural holes are in the critical paths between different clusters. Thus, intuitively, those bridging nodes should be blocked in suppressing diffusion processes, which coincides with the result demonstrated in [45] . In addition to transitivity, high assortativity of a network implies that highly connected nodes are prone to connecting other highly connected nodes, i.e., hub nodes have hub neighbors. In the targeted containing policy, the degree-based method takes into account the fragility of the hubs in scale-free networks [20] . However, due to the high transitivity and degree-degree correlation, the targeted nodes with high degrees are likely to be densely connected and thus fail to maximize their influence on spreading processes. In contrast, the structural hole count takes into account not only high connections but the type of the connections between the target nodes and the rest nodes. That is, those hubs with weak ties are more important in preventing the infections. Consequently, blocking such nodes will significantly improve the performance of the containing strategy.",

In fact, both methods are very efficient in containing the spreading process with a small portion of immunized nodes in disassortative networks. The reason is that disassortative networks often have a scale-free degree distribution. Neighbors of high-degree nodes usually only have a small number of connections and these neighbors are not interconnected directly by virtue of the disassortativity property. In other words, the structural hole counts and the degree are close for those truly important nodes in containing the spreading process. Therefore, high-degree nodes also span the structural holes among the low-degree nodes, which leads to a big overlap between the immunization sets derived from the two methods.",

By leveraging the role of structural holes in shaping the communication channels, we have devised an effective heuristic approach to suppress the spreading processes in a network. Using a variety of real-world networks including several large-scale social networks, we have demonstrated experimentally that the proposed method can significantly outperform the degree-based heuristic for networks with high transitivity and assortativity. We further interpret this success by the correlation of structural holes and weak ties among high-degree nodes. Compared to greedy algorithms, our approach based on the topological characteristics depends merely on local connectivity patterns and is computationally much more attractive for real-world applications.",
