IL-12 polarizes T cells towards a type 1 cytokine profile characterized by high IFN\u03b3 and low IL-4 secretion, whereas IL-4 polarizes T cells towards a type 2 cytokine profile characterized by high IL-4 and low IFN\u03b3 secretion [4]. Type 1 polarized T cells are effective at controlling intracellular pathogens [5] and have been implicated in some T cell-mediated autoimmune disorders [6], [7]. Type 2 polarized T cells are effective at controlling extracellular pathogens, such as helminths [8], [9] and also promote humoral immunity, including IgE-mediated allergic responses [10]. Ex vivo exposure of T cells to type 1 or type 2 cytokine environments during cognate TCR interaction with MHC plus antigen rapidly polarizes their cytokine secretion profile.",

NK T cells, basophils, mast cells, and T cells themselves are all candidate sources [11], [12]. The IL-12 that promotes type 1 cytokine responses in vivo is produced primarily by dendritic cells and macrophages; IL-12 is secretedrapidly in response to infection by many intracellular pathogens [5], [13], [14], [15]. Microbial LPS, bacterial DNA containing CpG motifs, and Leishmania antigen are also potent inducers of IL-12 in phagocytic cells [5]. The response of the innate immune system to some infectious agents and microbial products is vigorous enough to increase levels of circulating IL-12. For example,infection with murine cytomegalovirus [13], [16] or Toxoplasma gondii\n[17], or exposure to LPS [18] or the dsRNA viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) [19] markedly increases circulating IL-12 levels in vivo in mice. Activation of APCs by pathogens, causing them to secrete IL-12 could, therefore, have systemic effects on T cells. IL-12 is also produced, in the absence of infection, by dendritic cells after cognate interaction with T cells [20], [21] and in the thymus [22], [23].",

Because positive and negative selection by self-peptide\u2013MHC complexes during thymocyte development requires engagement of the TCR [24], [25], [26], we hypothesized that thymic T cells can be polarized. To test this hypothesis, we used rat adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC) to examine the effect of exposure to a type 1 cytokine environment on T cell development. We chose to study thymi from BBDR rats because we have shown previously that BBDR rat ATOC recapitulate normal thymocyte development, and generate normal ratios of functional CD4+and CD8+single positive TCRhicells [27], [28]. The BBDR rat is phenotypically normal and disease-free, but can be induced to develop autoimmune diabetes by environmental perturbants, including viral infection [29], [30], [31]. Diabetes in these animals is associated with a type 1 immune response [32].",

We used pharmacological inhibitors to discriminate these possibilities.

Both types of secondary culture were then treated with either: (1) CsA, which inhibits TCR-mediated signaling, but does not affect T cell activation mediated by IL-12 plus IL-18 [37]; (2) the p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor SB203580, which inhibits IL-12 and IL-18-mediated, but not TCR-mediated T cell activation [39]; (3) tyrphostin A1, which reportedly does not inhibit either pathway [39]; or (4) DMSO, the vehicle for each of the other compounds.

For the standard conditions of polarization (ATOC treatment B), all of the IFN\u03b3+cells were TCR+, with a similar percentage of IFN\u03b3+cells in the immature CD4+CD8+, and the selected CD4 and CD8 single positive cells. IFN\u03b3+cells were observed in both CD4 and CD8 single positive populations at a ratio of 1:4 (data not shown). Omission of the anti-IL-4 did not significantly decrease the frequency of IFN\u03b3+cells (treatment C) relative to the standard conditions. Both IL-12 and IL-2 appear to be necessary for optimal induction of IFN\u03b3 in day 5 ATOC (treatments D and F vs. B and C). The frequency of IFN\u03b3+cells was similar between groups that received 10, 2, or 0.4 ng/ml of IL-12 (treatments B, G, and H).",

T cells derived from type 1 cytokine-conditioned rat ATOC spontaneously produced large amounts of IFN\u03b3. Re-exposure of these cells to type 1 cytokines induced even more production of IFN\u03b3 and was associated with T cell activation. These events occurred in the absence of exogenous foreign antigen.

Our data clearly document the secretion of copious amounts of IFN\u03b3 and of T cell activation following exposure of ATOC to type 1 cytokines. Most importantly, the data suggest that intrathymic polarization could be an important process in vivo as well as in vitro. We note that IL-12, the principal agent of polarization used in these studies, is synthesized in the thymus [22], [23] and circulates at high levels after exposure to certain pathogens [5], [13], [16], [17], [18]\n[55], [56] or followingadministration of CpG DNA [57]. Nonlethal doses ofToxoplasma gondii, Toxoplasma cruzi, MCMV or CpG DNA given to mice result in circulating levels of IL-12 that range from 0.45 to 15 ng/ml, with persistence in the serum from 36 h to 8 days. Ex vivo production of IL-12 by cells from mice given CpG DNA, T. gondii, or Mycoplasma bovis range from 1\u20135 ng/ml in 24\u201348 h cultures of spleen or lymph node cells, or cultures of APCs [18], [58], [59]. Culture of human PBL or monocytes with seven different species of gram positive bacteria or Heliobacter pylori induces the production of \u223c1\u20134 ng/ml of IL-12 after 18\u201324 h in culture [59], [60]. In addition, virus infections in humans and mice can further increase sensitivity to concurrent or subsequent bacterial challenges by a mechanism that involves elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 [61]. Circulating IL-12 levels following exposure to certain pathogens are therefore comparable to those able to polarize thymocytes in ATOC.",

Thymocytes survive poorly in cell suspension cultures, irrespective of whether the cells are cultured in the presence or absence of type 1 cytokines (B.J.W., unpublished observations). In contrast, rat ATOC allows normal thymocyte development and selection to occur in vitro. It overcomes the problem of in vivo studies by allowing for analysis of T cell development in the absence of seeding of the thymus with thymocyte progenitors and in the absence of emigration from the thymus [27]. Rat ATOC recapitulates faithfully normal rat intrathymic T cell developmental kinetics and phenotypes.

We interpret these data to suggest that TCR\u2013MHC-ligand interactions play an important role in the activation of the T cells that are cultured in type 1 cytokines. We recognized that xenogeneic reactivity against bovine serum could have been an alternative explanation for these results, but our control cultures performed with rat serum largely excluded thispossibility.",

            "text": "The combination of IL-12 and IL-2 is optimal for type 1 cytokine polarization of both ATOC and secondary cultures (Table 2; Fig. 5). Anti-IL-4 by itself is not sufficient to bias cells to a type 1 cytokine response, but it was shown to facilitate IFN\u03b3 production in the ATOC but not in secondary cultures. We were unable to detect IL-4 in day 5 ATOC by ELISA in cultures that received IL-12 plus IL-2 (<8 pg/ml in four determinations), but it is possible that IL-4 could have been produced earlier in the ATOC and/or utilized by day 5. Based on our observation that exposure of developing thymocytes to polarizing conditions generates activated T cells, we speculate that the exposure of thymocytes in vivo to analogous conditions may represent a mechanismunderlying the generation and survival of self-reactive T cells in genetically pre-disposed individuals. If polarizing conditions were to be present in the thymus, self-reactivity might result from interference with the negative selection of high affinity self-reactive T cells or from the promotion of positive selection. Alternatively, self-antigens might be cross-presented to T cells as a result of cytokine induced maturation of APCs, a mechanism that has been described for peripheral T cells [65], [66]. Many self-antigens are expressed by thymic stromal cells, and correlative studies suggest that intrathymic self-antigen expression may play an important role in T cell tolerance [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]. Self-antigens that are normally expressed at levels too low to induce positive selection might do so in the context of a pro-inflammatory environment, up-regulated APC function [5], [72], and a lowered threshold for T cell activation [73], [74]. The role of type 1 cytokines in altering selection during intrathymic development is unknown, but perturbation of intrathymic selection in experimental systems has been shown to lead to the generation of autoreactive T cells [75], [76], [77]. Environmental perturbation in general, and infection in particular, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases [78], [79]. Polarizing conditions within the thymus resulting from high circulating levels of IL-12 generated by infection could represent a mechanism linking genetic susceptibility to autoreactivity to the environmental \u2018triggers\u2019 of autoimmune disease.",

Panel B: BBDR lymph node cells cultured in type 1 cytokines for 5 days (black bars) and a sample of freshly isolated BBDR rat lymph node cells (gray bars) were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of differentiation (Panel B), and activation (Panel C) antigens. Each data point represents the mean percentage of cells (\u00b11 SD) in the lymphocyte fraction expressing the indicated antigen in three to five independent experiments. Percentages obtained using isotype control antibodies were uniformly <1% and were not subtracted from the values shown.\u2217p<0.01 vs. freshly isolated cells.",
