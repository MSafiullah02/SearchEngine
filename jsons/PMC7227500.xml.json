Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is very important to cut off the transmission chain. Virus isolation and culture is the gold standard of SARS-CoV-2 detection, but it is time-consuming and is limited to experimental conditions. Nucleic acid test is not only a vital tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, but also a basis for judging the curative effect. Fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is the most widely used detection method of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, faster and simpler molecular detection assays are highly needed in resources-limited areas where the professional personnel and PCR cyclers are lacking. For example, in the community fever clinics, a large number of patients with fever need to be identified or rule out in a timely manner to prevent the potential cross-infection in the crowded clinics.",

Briefly, the principle of RAA is to use a recombinase binding tightly to the primer to form a complex of the enzyme and the primer. When the primer searches for a sequence completely complementary to the template DNA, strand replacement occurs between the primers and the template with the single-stranded DNA binding (SSB). In the presence of DNA polymerase, the new DNA fragment could be amplified rapidly in vitro. A specific fluorescent probe is added to the amplification system to realize RAA real-time monitoring. RAA has been successfully applied in the detection of adenovirus [4], pertussis [5], respiratory syncytial virus [6], coxsackievirus, enterovirus [7, 8] and Hepatitis B virus [9] in our previous reports.",

A large number of qRT-PCR methods have been developed for specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2 [[13], [14], [15]], but they are not well suitable in the community. Point-of-care testing (POCT) is undoubtedly the most powerful detection in this regard, but the main obstacle of POCT is the relatively low throughput hence not ideal for rapid screening [16]. Isothermal nucleic acid amplifications, such as NASBA, LAMP [17, 18] and CRISPR's Sherlock technology [19, 20], are good alternatives to qRT-PCR, these methods showed comparable sensitivity and specificity to qRT-PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and relatively easier operation and shorter turn-around time, however, these reports only included limited clinical samples and data, the feasibility of these methods need to be further verified. In this study, we conduct a multicenter clinical evaluation of RT-RAA kit for SARS-CoV-2 using about 1000 samples. We also include respiratory tract samples (throat swabs, sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and non-respiratory samples (stool and whole blood), which makes our results more reliable and adaptable.",

The detection results could be achieved in 8-15 minutes after addition of extracted nucleic acid. Actually, the time for vast majority of positive samples (corresponding Ct values ranged from 17.00-37.00) was within 10 minutes. As RT-RAA is able to test 16 sample per run, in practice, one person is able to finish 16 samples in 40 minutes by working with automatic DNA extraction. In addition, the RAA device is a portable equipment and easy to use. Moreover, the RT-RAA kits containing the lyophilized reaction pellets are very convenient for transport because lyophilized reagents are stable at room temperature. Like qRT-PCR kits, the single-tube design of RT-RAA also reduces the possibility of cross-contamination while has lower cost than that of qRT-PCR kits.",

This discrepancy between two methods was not dissolved by repetitive experiments because of the heavy work burden during the outbreak in the institutions. The failure (potential false negative and false positive) of RT-RAA kit might be due to either the viral load is lower than the detection limit or operation errors or the difference in the sensitivity and specificity of different qRT-PCR kits used.
