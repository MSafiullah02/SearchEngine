Previous systematic reviews of this topic are similarly limited in the types of MDROs studied and outcomes measured, and have had mixed results.13, 16, 17, 18 More importantly, contact precautions in all of these reviews were grouped with other infection control practices such as active surveillance.13, 16, 17, 18, 19 Thus, gaps in the literature exist regarding effects of contact precautions alone and against emerging MDROs.14, 15\n",

Four studies were non-randomized quasi-experimental studies comparing pre- and post-intervention MDRO rates, whereas two studies had a repeated treatment design.27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 One study took place during an MDRO outbreak.27 Studies included in this review had four different MDROs as primary outcomes, many comparators, and varying methods of identifying MDRO colonization and infection. These fundamental differences prevented meaningful use of meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of contact precautions against MDRO transmission. The small number of studies included in the review and difficulty in identifying and locating unpublished studies also precluded us from an assessment of publication bias.33\n",

Conflicting data from studies with poor design and/or low compliance does not constitute evidence against contact precautions; rather, these data are inconclusive. Whereas the study that performed best on our quality score found no significance between contact precautions and not isolating patients, this study did not consistently assess intervention compliance in the various study phases.31 The included study that showed a difference in MDRO transmission with use of contact precautions did not report compliance rates and could not be assessed for quality on any of the other bias and confounding items of the quality assessment tool.32 Inconsistencies and absences in compliance monitoring and reporting make it impossible to tell whether protocols were completed as intended, threatening the internal validity of these studies.34 The CDC recently faced similar difficulty interpreting health outcomes after two healthcare workers were infected with Ebola virus in Texas, as it was unclear whether transmission had been due to inadequate isolation precaution protocols or to a protocol breach.37 In practice, healthcare facilities should be regularly monitoring compliance, and investigating potential lapses when cross-transmission is documented, to potentially resolve systems-based inefficiencies. It is also important for researchers to monitor and report compliance to understand what effectiveness level can be reasonably expected in practice where compliance may be lower than in clinical studies. Given the quality of evidence presented here, it may be advisable that healthcare workers and administrators continue to devote focus and resources to improve components of contact precautions and other infection prevention techniques with strong effectiveness evidence, such as hand hygiene technique and compliance.3\n",

            "text": "Although the included studies have limitations that have been well described in the literature on this topic, such as lack of intervention allocation concealment, some demonstrate realistic opportunities for improvement in future studies. First, two of the included papers contained a power calculation.29, 31 As MDRO infections are rare events and most studies on this topic include small patient samples due to feasibility and cost concerns, future studies should also conduct a calculation to determine whether the study is adequately powered to detect differences in infection rates between intervention phases.12 Second, four of the included studies attempted to control for time trends in healthcare-associated infections and other confounders through statistical analysis.27, 28, 31, 32 A concurrent, non-equivalent control, such as in Cheng et al., may address this issue, but concurrent controls are not always feasible. In the future, longitudinal studies with multiple pre-intervention collection points could add even stronger evidence by directly measuring and accounting for infection trends that are not related to the intervention, as in Bearman et al.\n38 Third, these studies differ from most previous publications by attempting to monitor intervention compliance.12, 39 Previous studies that monitored compliance demonstrated improved adherence (i.e. with hand hygiene) when an isolation precautions intervention was implemented.40, 41 However, this was not consistent with levels of compliance reported in the studies reviewed here.28, 29, 30, 31 Low compliance with contact precautions could be the reason that this intervention appears to be equally or less effective than other interventions.31 This body of evidence demonstrates the implementation of a number of improvements in study design which, when combined in future studies, may yield substantially stronger evidence.",
