Although, a few exceptional species, such as the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) and sharks have been claimed to be resistant to cancer (Finkelstein, 2005, Tian et al., 2013). Recent studies have, however, shown that even these species may develop cancer (Delaney et al., 2016, Finkelstein, 2005) strongly suggesting that the vast majority of multicellular organisms are indeed susceptible to cancer. The frequent occurrence of cancer in metazoans suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild (Vittecoq et al., 2013). This is supported by a recent review of wildlife cancer by McAloose and Newton (2009) demonstrating that high prevalence of cancer in, for example, Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) resulted in concomitant significant increase in levels of mortality and reduction in fitness.",

            "text": "Wildlife cancer statistics are, however, highly scattered in the scientific literature and hence challenging to access. Moreover, tumors in wildlife are most commonly detected during postmortem examination and therefore hard to confirm without histopathological examinations. However, even such analyses can be inaccurate because of high levels of autolysis (organ disintegration) (McAloose and Newton, 2009). In addition, individuals harboring tumors often display a decrease in body condition frequently resulting in higher levels of parasite/pathogen infections and concomitant increased levels in morbidity and mortality (Vittecoq et al., 2013) further impeding a correct analysis of the ultimate cause of death. The combination of the negative effects of cancer and/or pathogen/parasite infections has also been shown to result in increased levels of predation (Vittecoq et al., 2013). In our view, the combination of the problems involved in accurately recording wildlife cancer, the increased risk of succumbing to pathogens/parasites, and/or predation has often led to a somewhat erroneous assumption that although cancer is common in domestic animals, it remains rare in the wild. If, as we suggest, cancer may be a significant determinant of animal fitness it is therefore crucial to determine cancer prevalence in the wild.",

In bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) neurofibromatosis-like tumors are most likely caused by an \u201cextrachromosomal DNA virus-like agent\u201d (Coffee et al., 2013) whereas in European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) cancer development have been suggested to be caused by a \u201cherpesvirus-like agent\u201d (Coffee et al., 2013). In northern pike (Esox lucius) a corona virus has been suggested to be the cause for the development of lymphosarcoma (Papas et al., 1976). This species also shows substantial seasonal variation in lymphosarcoma prevalence but the underlying etiology is unknown (Papas et al., 1976). In brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), however, the higher levels of liver neoplasms (15%) recorded on one of the lakes investigated have been suggested to be caused by pollution (Baumann et al., 2008). Similarly, a study of English sole (Parophrys vetulus) revealed that up to 24% of the fish had developed liver neoplasms of which etiology could be traced to have been caused by pollution/chemical carcinogens (Malins et al., 1987).",

However, the epidermal papilloma recorded in the latter taxon appears to result in low mortality (Coffee et al., 2013). In contrast, cancers, such as plasmacytoid leukemia have been shown to result in up to 50% mortality in commercially important taxa, such as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Eaton et al., 1994) and neurofibromatosis-like tumors have been shown to result in 100% mortality in bicolor damselfish (Coffee et al., 2013). Apart from the latter two studies, the remaining studies do not provide any data on the effect of cancer on fish mortality. In spite of this we find it reasonable to suggest that the high tumor frequency observed in several species may have a significant negative impact on fish fitness. Given the importance of fish in the human diet the high cancer prevalence and associated mortality recorded in some fish taxa, clearly demonstrate the need of a substantial increase in research on the effect of cancer on both marine and freshwater fish.",

However, no information about tumor etiology or its possible effects on the frogs was provided. Interestingly, in a later study McKinnell and Martin (1979) observed a gradual temporal decline in tumor prevalence and in 1978 no tumors were observed in 1216 dissected frogs. McKinnell and Martin (1979) suggested that the decline in cancer prevalence was caused by a significant reduction in frog numbers and a concomitant reduction in the release of oncogenic viruses into the breeding ponds. However, the authors could not rule out that a gradual reduction of carcinogenic pollutants into the breeding ponds could have caused the decline in tumor prevalence.",

Although fibropapillomatosis (FP) mainly affects green turtles (Chelonia mydas) it has also been documented in loggerheads (Caretta caretta; Aguirre et al., 1999b). Green turtles have been subjected to numerous and extensive research projects and here we summarize the major findings from some of these studies. FP in green turtles results in tumor growth on eyes, oral cavity, skin, carapace, plastron, and/or internal organs (Santos et al., 2010). Consequently the disease may significantly reduce turtle foraging efficiency. FP shows significant geographic variation not only in prevalence (ranging from 0% to 92%) but also in severity (Santos et al., 2010). Moreover, in Brazil the disease is absent in juvenile green turtles but increases in prevalence in older turtles (Santos et al., 2010). In contrast in Hawaii, FP affects mainly juvenile turtles (Balazs and Pooley, 1990, Work and Balazs, 1999). However, the reason(s) for the age-specific increase in FP prevalence in Brazil and the age-specific difference in cancer development in Brazil and Hawaii is unknown. Interestingly, Chaloupka et al. (2009) reported on cases where FP had regressed and even completely disappeared in some individual green turtles in Hawaii, and that the diseases since the mid-1990s has showed a significant decline in prevalence.",

Jennings (1968) estimated the prevalence of neoplasia in wild birds in Great Britain to be between 0.1% and 1.0%. Similar low cancer prevalence was recorded by Gates et al. (1992) in Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior; 2 out of 1272 birds, 0.2%). Both birds were young and emaciated and microscopical analyses suggested that the tumors \u201chad the typical appearance of spindle cell sarcomas\u201d (Gates et al., 1992). Similar results on low cancer prevalence in wild birds were published by Siegfried (1983) who found tumors in only 9 out of more than 18,000 birds examined (0.05%). Although based on a significantly smaller sample size, 3 out of 13 (23%) ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) were diagnosed having tumors (Howerth et al., 1986). One bird was diagnosed with a lipoma, the second bird a fibroma, while the third bird had developed a renal carcinoma metastatic to the liver (Howerth et al., 1986). The high prevalence recorded in ruffed grouse should, however, be interpreted with caution as all three birds were delivered for examination because they all suffered from obvious lesions. Reece (1992) reported 383 cases of cancer from a collection of more than 10,000 birds (3.8%) submitted for necroscopy in Victoria, Australia from 1977 to 1987. As the birds examined included both wild and captive birds and no data are provided on the number of birds in each of the two groups, again the data on cancer prevalence should be interpreted with caution.",

            "text": "Cancer prevalence and its effect on some wild mammal population, such as California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) have been subjected to intensive research (Gulland et al., 1996, Martineau et al., 2002). Between 1979 and 1994 the prevalence of a metastatic carcinoma of urogenital origin in stranded California sea lions was reported to be 18% (Gulland et al., 1996). However, between 1998 and 2012 the prevalence of this cancer increased to 26% (Browning et al., 2015). This metastatic carcinoma appears to result in 100% mortality as all animals died during rehabilitation (Gulland et al., 1996). The actual prevalence of this cancer is most likely lower as only sick animals are likely to strand, but despite this the cancer represents a significant cause of death (Browning et al., 2015). Recent studies have found that the etiology of the cancer is associated with individual genotype, persistent organic pollutants, and/or a herpesvirus (Browning et al., 2015). Similar high cancer prevalence has been recorded in an isolated beluga population living in the St. Lawrence estuary (Martineau et al., 2002). Although the primary causes of death were respiratory and gastrointestinal infections with metazoan parasites, observed in 22% of the belugas, cancer was the second most common cause of death across all age groups and observed in 18% of the stranded belugas (Martineau et al., 2002). Cancer prevalence in adults was even higher (27%) and Martineau et al. (2002) estimated the annual rate of all cancer types in belugas to 163 out of 100,000 animals, a rate significantly higher than that reported for any other cetacean populations and similar to that of recorded in humans. Beluga habitat in the St. Lawrence estuary is highly contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by the local aluminum smelters, strongly suggesting that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a major cause of the high cancer prevalence recorded in this population (Martineau et al., 2002).",

However, no data regarding cancer etiology or pathogenesis of the walrus examined are presented. Between 1975 and 1997, 53 female Baltic gray seals aged between 15 and 40 years were found dead along the Baltic coast of Sweden, of which 34 (64%) where diagnosed having developed uterine leiomyomas (B\u00e4cklin et al., 2003). Although little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of leiomyoma in Baltic gray seals, B\u00e4cklin et al. (2003) tentatively suggested an association between cancer prevalence and pollutants, such as organochlorines. However, as mentioned earlier, the actual prevalence of uterine leiomyomas in female Baltic gray seals is most likely lower as only sick animals are likely to strand.

It is therefore interesting to note that some of the highest cancer prevalence\u2019s observed in wild mammals (>50%) have been recorded in species/populations with low genetic diversity, such as the Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae; Funk et al., 2016, Vickers et al., 2015) and the South African Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra; Marais and Page, 2011, Marais et al., 2007, Sasidharan et al., 2011). Vickers et al. (2015) suggested that the high prevalence of ceruminous gland tumors (carcinomas and adenomas) observed in the Santa Catalina Island foxes may have a genetic basis. Similarly, the high cancer prevalence observed in one of the South African Cape mountain zebra populations has also been suggested to be associated with concomitant low genetic diversity (Marais et al., 2007, Sasidharan et al., 2011). Interestingly, as mentioned earlier, the high prevalence of cancer in California sea lions may also, at least partly, have a genetic basis (Browning et al., 2015). The possible association between reduced genetic diversity and cancer prevalence is further supported by the high prevalence of cancer observed in both captive and wild western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville), a highly endangered Australian marsupial once widespread across western and southern Australia but now restricted to two small islands off the Western Australian coast (Woolford et al., 2008, Woolford et al., 2009). Captive breeding of this species has been severely hampered by debilitating cutaneous and mucocutaneous papillomatosis and carcinomatosis, associated with infection of papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV1) (Woolford et al., 2008, Woolford et al., 2009).",

For example, although cancer prevalence in captive black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) has been shown to affect 55% of the ferrets, the cancer almost exclusively affected postreproductive animals (Lair et al., 2002). The age-specific increase in cancer prevalence recorded in captive animals suggests that the significance of cancers recorded, similar to that recorded in black-footed ferrets, may therefore have limited or in some cases even no fitness effect in the wild. Regardless, cancer statistics recorded in captive animals remain an important source of information for studies in comparative oncology, as well as providing data on cancer etiology.",
