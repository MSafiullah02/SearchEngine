Furthermore, rapid diagnosis could also help ensure prompt isolation of the infected patients and avoid further expansion of the disease. In the presented 6 cases, the three who came to hospital early after the onset of the symptoms all had a clear and direct epidemiology history. But they were all with only minimal to mild abnormal pulmonary findings. In contrast, the other three had much more severe pulmonary changes including consolidation and fibrosis, which were reported more common in cases with severe disease in SARS and MERS.13 Simultaneously, the delayed isolation for these three cases might have led to transmission to their families or other people.",

Secondly, only five of the six cases had follow-up HRCT within the study period, and thus the change in characteristics of their images cannot represent all of the cases.
