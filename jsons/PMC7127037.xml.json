            "text": "Quercetin is a flavonoid, a natural substance with a phenolic structure. Flavonoids can be divided into various classes on the basis of their molecular structure with quercetin belonging to the flavone class, which has a planar structure due to the double bond in the central ring of the 2-phenylchromen-4-one (2-phenyl-1-benzopyran-4-one) backbone. This flavonoid group can be found in abundance in onions, apples, broccoli, and berries (Nijveldt et al., 2001, Formica and Regelson, 1995). Quercetin pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in humans has previously been studied (Moon et al., 2008, Graefe et al., 2001). An important effect of quercetin is its ability to scavenge for oxygen-derived free radicals (Heijnen et al., 2001), given its antioxidant properties at low concentrations (Robaszkiewicz et al., 2007). Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments have also shown that flavonoids possess potential anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antiviral, anti-carcinogenic and anti-asthmatic properties (Pettinari et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2004, Li et al., 2001, Davis et al., 2008, Gang et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2008).",

Furthermore, there is evidence that quercetin plays a critical role in the amelioration of the pathogenic process of asthma in a murine model (mice) (Park et al., 2009), due to the alteration of specific cytokine production (Th1/Th2) and transcriptor factors (T-bet and GATA-3) gene expression in OVA-induced asthma model mice, suggesting quercetin could be used as a new therapeutic approach to allergic airway diseases. More recently, when given orally to guinea pigs, quercetin has been found to reduce hyper-reactivity of airways, one of the main attributes of allergic asthma (Joskova et al., 2011); causing significant broncodilation.",

Previous studies have tried to resolve this issue by producing nanocrystals with enhanced dissolution (Kakran et al., 2012, Li et al., 2009). An alternative approach would be to incorporate the drug into a lipid matrix (Li et al., 2009). The production of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) has been previously studied as a respiratory drug delivery vehicle for both poorly water-soluble drugs, such as budesonide (Mezzena et al., 2009) and for more water-soluble drugs, such as salbutamol (Scalia et al., 2012). There are many advantages in using SLMs (Jaspart et al., 2005), with the most significant being the ability to control release after deposition. Furthermore, SLMs should be well tolerated in vivo since they are made of physiological compounds. Of course, the toxicity of the surfactants and other excipients, used for their manufacture, needs to be considered.",

Tristearin is a commercial monoacid triglyceride. Generally, triglycerides exhibit three different polymorphic forms characterised by particular chain packing and thermal stability: alpha (\u03b1), beta-prime (\u03b2\u2032), and beta (\u03b2) (Hernqvist, 1990). In this specific experiment, tristearin presented an endotherm corresponding to the melting of the \u03b2 phase at 63.75 \u00b0C, similar to previous literature (Lutton, 1945). Phosphatidylcholine is a surface-active molecule. Its transition temperature from crystalline to mesomorphic (liquid crystalline) was visible at around 84.22 \u00b0C, in agreement with previously reported values (Rutven and McElhaney, 2011).",

The moisture sorption of the SLMs was 3.3% at 90% RH. The reduction in moisture sorption for the SLMs in comparison to the phosphatidylcholine (which equates for \u223c13% of the SLM particle mass) is most likely due to the contributing effects of the drug and tristearin (which make up the majority of the particle) and the presence of phosphatidylcholine on the surface of the particles (contributing to the high humidity sorption of SLMs).",

            "text": "Although this study indicates that the absorption of quercetin is enhanced by the presence of phosphatidylcholine or tristearin, the real mechanism is still unclear. It is possible that the phospholipid may be incorporated into the luminal cell membrane, and this may constitute the primary step in the mechanism by which phosphatidylcholine affects tight junction permeability. Furthermore, changes in the lipid environment of the cell membrane may affect the basic transport properties of the Calu-3 epithelium. Additional studies are needed to evaluate this possibility.",

We have demonstrated SLM particle technology can be used to deliver this naturally derived flavonoid for the treatment of range of respiratory diseases. The effect of the absorption enhancing non-toxic excipients in increasing the permeability of quercetin has also been highlighted; making this approach significant, since the raw micronised quercetin was not transported across epithelia. To the authors knowledge no previous studies have investigated quercetin transport mechanism using Calu-3 cell epithelial monolayer. This is an important aspect of the study since the lung epithelia will be the first barrier after deposition in the airways. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism.",
