            "text": "Schiff base is known in the name of Hugo Schiff who first reported the reversible acid-catalyzed condensation reaction between primary amine with carbonyl compounds [1], [2]. They are also known as imines with general structure R\u2500CH=N\u2500R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 is linear or cyclic alkyl and/or aryl group which may be differently substituted [3]. Schiff bases are an important class of ligands for co-ordination chemistry, and they coordinate to metal ions via azomethine nitrogen [4]. Schiff base ligands have been extensively studied in the field of coordination chemistry mainly because of their facile syntheses, easy availability, and electronic properties. In recent times, Schiff base coordination chemistry has attracted much attention because of their significance in organic synthesis, analytical chemistry, refining of metals, metallurgy, electroplating, and photography [5], [6], [7]. Schiff bases have wide applications in dye industry, catalysis, fungicidal, and agrochemical [8], [9]. Several Schiff bases are reported to possess remarkable antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities [10]. In such class of compounds, the C=N moiety is important for biological activity. Abdel-Rahman et al. [10] have reported number of transition metal complexes by using variety of Schiff base ligands and have studied their different biological activities such as antimicrobial, anticancer, antifungal, etc. For example, a number of Fe (II) complexes have designed and synthesized by using variety of Schiff bases ligands derived from 5-bromosalicylaldehyde (bs) and various \u03b1-amino acids such as L-alanine (ala), L-phenylalanine (phala), L-aspartic acid (aspa), L-histidine (his), and L-arginine (arg). These complexes were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasaeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus and different antifungal cultures such as Penicillium purpurogenium, Aspergillus flavus, and Trichothecium rosium. It is found that Fe (II) complexes exhibited strong antibacterial and antifungal activity compared with the amino acids Schiff base ligands. Also, this complexes were tested for their interaction with calf thymus (CT) DNA by utilizing viscosity, UV-visible spectroscopy, and agarose gel electrophoresis measurements at pH = 7.2. The results revealed that the studied complexes showed different DNA binding constants that depend on the Schiff base ligands, and they strongly bind to CT DNA through intercalative mode [10b].",

It is found that ligand showed the less antimicrobial activity against the fungi and bacteria, whereas all the complexes exhibited more activity toward same fungi and bacteria. Some complexes showed great cytotoxic activity against colon carcinoma cells (HCT-116 cell line) and hepatic cellular carcinoma cells, (HepG-2). Metal Schiff base complexes are known since the mid-19th century. A large number of literature has highlighted their use as Schiff base ligands which are generally monodentate, bidentate, tridentate, tetradentate, etc. and depends on the presence of donor atoms. They have wide application in coordination chemistry as they are capable to form stable complexes with transition metals [11]. Owing to stability of Schiff base metal complexes as well as biological activity [12], electrochemistry [13] and potential applications in oxidation catalysis [14], researchers have focused significant attention to the chemistry of metal Schiff base complexes having nitrogen and other donor atoms [15] because of their vast applications in dyes, polymers, enzyme preparation as well as used as catalyst in different biological systems. Schiff bases are widely investigated owing to their selectivity, sensitivity, and synthetic flexibility to the central metal atom and the presence of azomethine group which brings in revealing the mechanism of transformation reaction biologically [16].",

            "text": "A variety of structural and coordination aspects of semicarbazones and thiosemicarbazone metal complexes of different group element have been discussed by Casas et al. [35]. Large number of thiosemicabazones is used for the detection and determination of different cations and anions. Spectrophotometry or extractive spectrophotometry are often employed for the quantitative determination of ions; in addition to these, some other techniques are also used such as gravimetry, titrimetry, and fluorimetry by Suvarapu et al. [36]. Asuero et al. [37] and Singh et al. [38] described application of thiosemicarbazone in inorganic analysis where they showed that biacetyl bis(4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone) (BBPT) as well as bipyridyl glyoxal bis(4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone) (BGPT) can be employed in the spectrophotometric determination of copper, zinc, mercury, and palladium. Such studies explained that the complexing properties of BBPT and BGPT are much better than those exhibited by biacetyl monothiosemicarbazone (BMTS) and picolinealdehyde-4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (PPTS). Also, BBPT is recommended as a reagent for the extractive spectrophotometric determination of cadmium and bismuth. In addition to their interesting coordination chemistry, semicarbazone and thiosemicabazones have attracted enormous attention because of their potentially useful biological activities [39]. There are several reports existing on biological activity of thiosemicabazones and their transition metal complexes [40]. The mechanism of biological activity of thiosemicarbazones are because of their ability to inhibit the biosynthesis of DNA, probably by blocking the enzyme ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase; binding to the nitrogen bases of DNA, by hindering base replication; and by creating the lesions in DNA strands by oxidative rupture [41], [42]. Zn (II) complexes of 2-acetylpyridine-4-phenyl semicarbazone have also been reported for their antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and fungi [43]. The synthesis of metal complexes of 1-vinyl-pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde semicarbazone and thiosemicarbazone and their importance in pharmaceutical as well as in medicinal field have been reported by Milkhaleva et al. [44]. ortho-Naphthoquinone thiosemicarbazone (NQTS) as well as naphthoquinone semicarbazone (NQSC) and their different Ni (II) complexes [45] were investigated for their in vitro anticancer activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. It is observed that nickel complex with NQTS and NQSC is more active in the inhibitory action of MCF-7 cell proliferation than the free ligands. This exposed the remarkable anticancer properties of these compounds. Chandra and Tyagi [46] have reported the synthesis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electronic spectral studies of Mn (II) and Cr (III) complexes of vanillin thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone, and they observed octahedral geometry for these complexes. Several novel semicarbazones and their Zn (II) and Cd (II) complexes (Scheme 6\n) were reported by Jadhav et al. [47] for their use as precursor for the synthesis of nanostructured metal selenides with particle diameter typically below 5\u201310 nm. Such precursors gave new dimension to their utility and possibly allowed their entry in the field of nanotechnology.",

An acid catalyzed condensation reaction of primary amine with an aldehyde or ketone under refluxing condition is the most commonly used method, e.g. mineral acids are often employed as catalysts (Scheme 7\n). In this reaction, the nucleophilic nitrogen atom of amine attacks on the carbonyl carbon results into an unstable intermediate, i.e. carbinolamine. Owing to the elimination of one molecule of water, a C=N bond is formed, and the product is known as imine. In general, reactivity of aldehyde is more than ketone in the formation of Schiff base as the reaction center of aldehyde is sterically less hindered as compared with the ketone. The condensation reaction is affected by the pH of the solution and the steric as well as electronic effect of an amine and carbonyl compounds. Because the dehydration of the carbinolamine is the rate-determining step of Schiff base formation, such reactions are catalyzed by acids. One should also note that the higher concentration of acid will protonate the amine and restricting its functionality as a nucleophile, thus suppressing formation carbinolamine. Therefore, syntheses of many Schiff bases are carried out at mild acidic pH.

All the Schiff base ligands and their Zn (II) complexes were studied for their antifungal activities against Colletotrichum falcatum, Aspergillus niger, F. oxysporum, and Carvularia pallescence. VO (IV) complexes of triazole, Ru (II) complexes with salicyladmine, Cu (II) complexes with benzoylpyridine, and Tl (I) complexes of benzothiazolines show antifungal activity [106].",

            "text": "Nowadays, our society is facing one of the main health disorder apoptosis obstructions, i.e. cancer [109]. For the treatment of cancer, chemotherapy is not effective. Hence, it has great importance to discover some novel and effective anticancer medicine [110]. Platinum-based complexes like cis-platin have been used as anticancer agent in chemotherapy [111], [112]. In recent years, researchers have attracted enormous attention to develop non-platinum metal-based complexes as anticancer agents. Isatin derivatives show noticeable antiviral activity in the treatment of HIV. Either HIV-1 infected or mock-infected MT-4 cells in human were incubated with different concentration of Isatin derivates (shown in Scheme 10), and the number of viable cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method after virus infection. At the concentration below its threshold toxicity, none of the Isatin derivatives displayed noticeable anti-HIV activity [113]. In addition to this, Isatin Schiff base ligands have been widely reported antiviral activities against Moloney leukemia virus [114], vaccinia [115], rhino virus [116], and SARS virus [117]. Ronen et al. have been described the mode of inhibition of N-methylisatin-\u03b2-4\u2032,4\u2032-diethylthiosemicarbazone (M-IBDET) on Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) production. They proposed that the inhibition of MLV by M-IBDET engaged a block in the translation of viral RNA rather than interference with viral RNA transcription [114]. Similarly, inhibition activities of Isatin derivatives derived from Isatin, sodium hydride, and different bromide compounds against a new viral uncharacteristic pneumonia, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) were also studied by Chen et al. [117]. They concluded that the N-substituted Isatin derivatives showed the inhibition activity against SARS CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) in minimum micromolar range such as 0.95\u201317.50 \u03bcM. The inhibition properties were evaluated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as well as confirmed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Among these all derivatives, compound 94 (Scheme 21A) was found the more potent and selective inhibitor for the SARS CoV 3CLpro.",

In recent years, researchers have focused on the functionalized nanoparticles and its numerous biological and biomedical applications such as fluorescent tags for detection of lymph node prostate cancer, in vivo fluorescent probes, delivery of drugs and images, etc. Some of these nanomaterials also show potential applications in nanolasers and photovoltaics [142], [143], [144], [145], [146]. From several decades, in the biomedical field, researchers have been exploring light emitting nanocrystals (about 2\u201310 nm) commonly known as semiconductor Quantum dots (QDs) by virtue of their tunable optical properties as fluorescent probes particularly in cellular imaging. CdSe, ZnS, and CdS are most commonly used QDs because of their exceptional characteristics such as enhanced brightness, better photostability, tunable emission spectra, and simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescence colors as compared with the conventional fluorescent proteins and organic dyes. Xing et al. [144] have discussed the optical properties of QDs along with their in vitro diagnostic applications as well as in vivo imaging applications, also the formation of self-illuminating QDs and its in vivo sensing, imaging applications. Wu et al. [146a] have reported the semiconductor quantum dots\u2013based fluorescent labels could be very effective for cellular imaging by linking to immunoglobin G (IgG) as well as streptavidin for labeling the breast cancer marker Her2 to detect nuclear antigens inside the nucleus and to stain actin along with microtubule fibers in the cytoplasm. They have been noticed that the labeling signals shown by these QDs are more particular for the proposed objects and are considerably more photostable as compared with organic dyes. Khanna et al. [146b] have studies a series of quantum dots for cytotoxic effect various cells, e.g. human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and Enrichlish ascitices cells. 65% biotoxicity was observed in MCF-7 for the CdS/CdSe core-shell QDs.",

Owing to these properties, 1,2,3-selenadiazole acts as vital precursor in material chemistry including nanotechnology as well as in ligand chemistry [148], [149], [150], [151], [152]. Reaction of 1,2,3-selenadiazoles with organotransition-metal complexes yielded respective diselenolenes. Morley et al. [149] have employed 1,2,3-selenadiazoles for the synthesis of cyclopentadienylcobalt and pentamethylcyclopentadienylcobalt diselenolenes by the formation of selenaketocarbene as intermediate through the elimination of dinitrogen from 1,2,3-selenadiazole. Such transition-metal dithiolenes or diselenolenes attracted enormous early attention because of their electrochemical and optical properties. It was reported that transition metal bis(dithiolenes) have been applied for the making of molecular superconductors, in mode locking and passive Q-switch applications. Considerable attention has been paid in the study of II-VI semiconductors such as CdSe, because by changing the particle size, its band gap can be adjusted across the visible region. In addition to this, CdSe shows different applications such as laser diodes, blue light emitting diodes, solar cells, and biological labeling [151]. Khanna et al. [152] have used selenadiazoles as selenium source for the synthesis of range of metal selenides including CdSe, ZnSe QDs as well as ZnSe/CdSe core shell quantum dots to promote plausibly less toxic and an eco-friendly synthetic method for development of QDs. Jadhav et al. [153], (a) have reported the solventless method for the preparation of heterocyclic organoselenium compounds, i.e. cycloalkano-1,2,3-selenadiazole by using their respective cycloalkane semicarbazones. The heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen and selenium atom like 1,2,3-selenadiazoles have been used as vital precursors for the material chemistry including nanotechnology as they shows thermal and photochemical decomposition during the dimer formation or formation of acyclic or new heterocyclic compounds.",

For example some Ni NPs are considered as anode materials for rechargeable batteries, ethanol fuel cell, and a fine substitute for a noble metal used in the internal electrodes of multilayer ceramic capacitors [160]. Nickel, cobalt, cadmium, and copper complexes with carbohydrazide have been attracted more attention because of its variety of applications in defense. It is documented that they are used as primary explosives [161], [162], [163], burning rate modifiers [57], and also in gas generating agents, [164], [165], [166]. Such types of compounds are used in Pyrotechnics as they possibly act as flame colorants. Copper complexes with carbohydrazide are used in pyrotechnics as an alternative for barium compounds which are normally toxic in nature, to produce flame in blue and green colors. Bushuyev et al.

In recent years, the scope of such compounds has broadened, and their new synthetic methodology has been evolved that are based on normal chemical reactions as well as by solid state reaction. There are also some reports on use of other source of energy during their synthesis. Recent literature also highlights the modern day application that has extended to materials chemistry as well as into nanotechnology. Schiff bases and semicarbazones offer a variety in their coordination of vast majority of transition metals and therefore offer great potential as precursors for new generation nanomaterials of respective metal or their compound semiconductors. Imine ligands such as Schiff base, semicarbazones, and their derivatives have therefore been widely explored for catalytic, pharmacological, industrial, etc. applications. Schiff base ligands are considered as interesting ligand because of the ease of preparation with versatility and variable denticity. Nowadays, Schiff base and their metal complexes are fascinating research topic that continuously provides us with new information about newly synthesized compounds. In this review, the biological, catalytic activity along with some miscellaneous applications of imine ligands and its metal complexes have been summarized taking the scope into materials chemistry directly or indirectly.",
