Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves for catastrophic outcome\u2013free results showed significant differences between patients with normouricemia or hypouricemia. In addition, FEUA correlated inversely with blood oxygenation. UA is the main metabolite of adenosine triphosphate degradation, and increased UA excretion has been observed in patients with respiratory failure.29 However, in such patients, serum UA levels were not decreased or changed by treatment,29 implicating increased UA production, rather than abnormal UA renal handling, in hypoxic patients. We speculate that both hypoxia and hypouricemia in patients with SARS indicate the severity of SARS-CoV infection, which affects both ventilation and UA excretion. In vivo and in vitro studies30, 31 have shown UA to be an important antioxidant, contributing as much as 60% of free-radical scavenging in human serum.32 A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that a nucleotide-supplemented diet could significantly reduce complications and shorten hospital stay after admission to an intensive care unit,33 suggesting serum UA as a possible surrogate of antioxidant capacity.34 It is not clear whether poor outcomes of hypouricemic patients with SARS are caused in part by a shortage of antioxidants.",
