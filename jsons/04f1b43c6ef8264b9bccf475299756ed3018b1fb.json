An efficient immune response against SARS-CoV-2 may be considered fundamental for the resolution of COVID-19. However, some studies have shown a significant relationship between the disease severity and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and subsets of immune cells [6, 7] . It has been suggested that during the response to SARS-CoV-2, the immune dysregulation and the high level of proinflammatory cytokines could be the main cause of tissue injury. Eventually, the exact pathophysiologic mechanism of COVID-19 remains still largely unknown.",

The alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses tend to infect mammals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infection in humans like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, while gammacoranaviruses and deltacoronaviruses have the ability to infect birds in addition to mammals [2, 9] . The betacoronaviruses comprise of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), Bat-SARS-like (SL) coronaviruses, and lastly identified SARS-CoV-2. SARS-Cov-2 possesses nonsegmented, single-stranded positivesense RNA (+ssRNA) with 5'-cap structure and 3'-poly-A tail which is a typical genomic structure of CoVs [10] . The genome analyses have revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96% and 79.5% identical to the bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13, and SARS-CoV, respectively [2] .Therefore, the bat has been suggested as a natural host of SARS-CoV-2 and the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 could be through unknown intermediate hosts. The genetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 103 Chinese patients demonstrated that this virus has been evolved into two main types; L type(~ 70%) and S type(~ 30 %). L type is more aggressive and infectious than S type which is the ancestral version [11] .",

            "text": "The genome of CoV contains six major open reading frames (OFRs) and numerous accessory genes. First OFRs (OFR1a/b), which encompasses the two-third of viral RNA, encode two large proteins of CoVs, polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab. These polyproteins are divided into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), responsible for viral RNA replication and transcription, by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) [12, 13] . The remaining OFRs on the one-third of the genome encode major structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, all of which are crucial for the viral infectivity as seen in Figure. CoVs possess a lipid bilayer envelope with S, M, and E proteins [14, 15] . The N protein is composed of an amino (N)-terminal (NT) domain and acarboxy (C)-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain and located in the core of the viral particle. Both domains bind to viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid [16, 17] . Besides, SARS-CoV N protein acts as an antagonist to the interferon pathway by regulating the signaling and synthesis of type I interferon (IFN), which is one of the most important response in the innate immunity to viral infection [18] . The M protein is the most abundant component of the viral envelope. The M protein contains a glycosylated NT ectodomain, three transmembrane (TM) domains, and a CT domain that binds to the nucleocapsid. The M protein gives the shape of the virus and promotes the membrane curvature and the virus assembly by interacting with the S protein and the ribonucleoprotein [14, 19, 20] . The E protein is a small integral membrane protein, including an NT ectodomain, a TM domain, and a CT endodomain. The E protein facilitates the assembly, the budding, and the envelope formation as well as the M protein [21] . Moreover, the E protein has an ion-channel activity, contributing factor of the inflammasome activation. The animal study has shown that blocking the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein by deletion of associated genes leads to the reduction of the edema and the level of inflammasomeactivated interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) all of which have an important role in the progression of ARDS [22] .",

S genome of SARS-CoV-2 has less than 75% identical sequence with previously known SARS-CoVs except for RaTG13 which of S genome is 93.1% identical with SARS-CoV-2 [2] . Besides, another genome analyses have elucidated that the sequence identity of S protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is %76 and most variation has been seen at the N terminus [23, 24] .The S glycoprotein consists of two domains: S1 domain which includes receptor-binding domain (RBD), interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the human host cells as SARS-CoV, and S2 domain which mediates virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry [2, 25] . The S2 domain comprises of three parts; a large ectodomain; a single TM domain, and a CT domain [26] . The sequence of RBD from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibits 73.5% identity [24] . The current study has indicated that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has lower affinity to ACE2 than the RBD of SARS-CoV [27] . However the result of the another study revealed that SARS-CoV2-S protein binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV [28] . After attachment of SARS-CoV-2 with S protein to ACE2 on the host cells, S protein is cleaved by host cell proteases to reveal the S2 domain for viral-host membrane fusion and viral entry which is coupled with TNF-\u03b1 production [10, 29, 30] .",

Nevertheless, the tissue S protein attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell to entry. After the attachment, host endosomal proteases mediate the virus membrane-endosome fusion for the release of the viral genome. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxycloroquine (HCQ) block the virus-receptor binding and virus-endosome fusion. Besides CQ, HCQ, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) inhibit the production of cytokines in macrophages and the antigen presentation in dendritic cells. In COVID-19, the count of neutrophils and leukosytes increase whereas the total count of lymphocytes CD4+ T cells, CD+8 T cells, regulatory T (T reg) cells, memory T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells decrease. Another beneficial effect of CQ and HCQ is increasing the activity of Treg. The aberrant proinflammatory cytokine production is observed in COVID-19. Several immunomodulatory therapies including interleukin (IL)-6 antagonists, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibitor, IL-1 antagonists, IL-17 antagonists, and antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents might be used for this cytokine storm to resolve and limit the further inflammation and tissue damage (The yellow arrow indicates a decrease in the number of cells; the blue arrow indicates and increase in the number of cells). injury caused by the virus could induce the exaggerated production of proinflammatory cytokines, the recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages and granulocytes. This results in the cytokine storm (CS) termed as a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), thus leading to further tissue damage [33] [34] [35] . Data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have shown that severe cases may be characterized by a cytokine storm inexorably progressing to ARDS [36] [37] [38] . Several features of COVID-19, such as the cytokine profile, serological markers, and clinical symptoms, resemble sHLH most commonly triggered by viral infection [6, 34] . Furthermore, another important evidence is that the severity of COVID-19 is related to the level of the proinflammatory cytokines and subsets of immune cells [6, 39] .",

In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the retrospective analysis has demonstrated that initial plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-\u0263, monocyte chemoattractant peptide (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP-1B, granulocytecolonystimulating factor (G-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) are increased in patients with COVID-19. The further analysis has shown that the plasma concentrations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-17, IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 in ICU patients are higher than non-ICU patients [36] . Moreover, the plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1, observed in severe infection, are prominently greater than those in nonsevere infection [37] . Few retrospective studies have revealed that the lung injury reported with Murray score is strongly associated with the level of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-\u0263, inducible interferon protein (IP)-10, G-CSF, and MCP-3 and these cytokines and chemokines excluding MCP-3 are positively related to SARS-CoV-2 viral load 2 [7] . The plasma level of IL-6, considered as a significant cytokine contributing to MAS, increases both in mild and severe patient groups of COVID-19: severe patients have a significantly higher level of IL-6 than mild or nonsevere patients [6, 37, 38, 40] . Furthermore, based on the assessment of pulmonary infiltration in patients with ARDS, the large area of lung injury (\u226550%) is closely correlated with the increased level of IL-6 and the subgroup of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood [41] .",

The prominent lymphopenia, indicating an impairment of immune system, develops in most COVID-19 patients especially in severe ones [4, 37] . Therefore, it seems that neutrophils and leukocytes might reinforce the CS other than lymphocytes in COVID-19. The level of lymphocytes and subsets of T cells which play a significant role in the balancing of immune response varies according to the type of the virus due to possible viral pathologic mechanism. Previous investigations have elicited that the total count of lymphocytes and the subset of T cells are reduced in patients with SARS-CoV infection [43, 44] . Data from recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to immune dysregulation through affecting the subsets of T cells. The significant alleviation of T cells is observed in COVID-19 and more pronounced in severe cases. In patients with COVID-19, the level of helper T cells (CD3+, CD4+) and cytotoxic suppressor T cells (CD3+, CD8+), and regulatory T cells are below normal level while helper T cells and regulatory T cells in severe patients are remarkably lower than nonsevere patients. Regulatory T cells are responsible for the maintenance of the immune homeostasis with suppressing the activation, proliferation, and proinflammatory function of most lymphocytes including CD+4 T cells, CD+8 T cells, NK cells, and B cells [45, 46] . Furthermore, the percentage of na\u00efve helper T cells amplifies while the percentage of memory helper T cells and CD28+ cytotoxic suppressor T cells decreases in severe COVID-19 [6, 37] . The equilibrium between the na\u00efve T cells and memory T cells is fundamental for mediating the efficient immune response [47] . In addition to T cells, the reduction of B cells and NK cells are seen in COVID-19. Another important result is the confirmed strong relationship between inflammatory markers, including ESR, CRP and IL-6 and the subset of lymphocytes [39] . However, previously it has been shown that there is no significant correlation between IL-6 and subsets of lymphocytes [6] . Although these reports have indicated that CD+4/CD+8 T cell ratio in SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to the healthy group, the increase in this ratio and the decline of CD+8 T cells and B cells are considered as a poor predictor for the assessment of post-treatment clinical follow-up [6, 39] . Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for an immune dysregulation with the induction of aberrant cytokine and chemokine response, alteration in level of the subgroup of lymphocytes all of which might result in cytokine storm and further tissue damage.",

Severe multi-source systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes, so one may think that corticosteroids may of benefit with their broad spectrum immunosuppressive effects. However, evidence has shown that use of corticosteroids delayed viral clearance in SARS and MERS infections, similarly they increased secondary infection rates, mortality and complications of steroid therapy in survivors of influenza pneumonitis [48] . In a randomized controlled trial that included 16 non-ICU SARS patients, \"early\" (<7 days of illness) hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load. Therefore, corticosteroids should not be used early phases of disease unless there is a clear indication for their use [49] . In SARS infection, some patients showed severe inflammatory features despite reductions in viral load with subsequent seroconversion, suggestive of exuberant immune response independent of viral load [50] . In two small observational study, use of corticosteroids did not show a survival benefit in COVID-19 patients even increased mortality rates when used in high doses [51] [52] [53] . Moreover, corticosteroid use was prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding as observed in SARS and MERS infections [54] . In the light of preliminary data, corticosteroids are more likely to function on inflammation-mediated lung injury and interstitial fibrosis at late-stage of ARDS [52] . However, the dose, duration, and timing of corticosteroids must be individualized considering risk-benefit ratio, until results of ongoing well-designed prospective cohort studies obtained. At present, several studies are registered to assess the efficacy of corticosteroids in COVID-19.",

They are also used in Q fever and porphyria cutanea tarda. HCQ has a better side effect profile than CQ and is strongly recommended for the long-term treatment of lupus unless the occurrence of a severe side effect. HCQ does not increase the risk of infections and has lipidlowering, antithrombotic and antineoplastic properties [55] . In adult rheumatic diseases, the recommended dosage is 200 to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) with a cut off of 6.5 mg/kg/daily, is usually well-tolerated. The most dreaded complication is retinal toxicity which rarely occurs in long term use (five or more years). Elders with kidney failure or tamoxifen users have an increased risk of retinal toxicity. CQ and HCQ may prolong QT interval which does not require routine ECG monitorization in recommended doses. At higher doses, these drugs have a potential risk of fatal arrhythmia or if combined with QT prolonging medications as well as those with cardiac diseases [56] . Other acute notable toxicities of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives are allergic reactions and neuropsychiatric events [57] . Very rarely they may cause cardiomyopathy which is thought to occur due to lysosomal accumulation with their chronic use [58] .",

Antiviral activity of HCQ was first observed in HIV and the hepatitis B infections in the early 1980s. Small studies showed its favorable efficacy in combination regimens of HBV, HCV and HIV infections. CQ and HCQ are thought to exert antiviral activity via multiple mechanisms. First, these agents interfere with glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of proteins. By interfering with terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the cellular receptor for S protein, both agents block virus-receptor binding and cell entry [61, 62] . Second, CQ and HCQ both are weak bases and concentrated in acidic, low-pH organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes, increasing their pH [61] . Endosomal acidification is required for the activation of endosomal proteases responsible for the initiation of coronavirus/endosome fusion that releases viral particles into the infected cells [63] . Therefore, CQ and HCQ inhibit viral release into the host cell by blocking endosomal acidification. Third, HCQ inhibits protein glycosylation and proteolytic maturation of viral proteins. Budding of the SARS-CoV occurs in the Golgi apparatus and results in the incorporation of the envelope spike glycoprotein into the virion [64] . Studies have shown a resulting accumulation of noninfective viral particles of HIV, or an inability of viral particles to bud out of the host cell, reducing spread of infection. Finally, antimalarial drugs act as protecting hemoglobin against invasion by malaria parasites with their effects on heme metabolism. There is abnormal heme metabolism in COVID-19 patients. Chloroquine phosphate competes with the porphyrin and binds to the viral protein, thereby inhibits the viral protein's attack on heme or binding to the porphyrin. According to a study, CQ could prevent ORF1ab, ORF3a, and ORF10 to attack the heme to form the porphyrin and inhibit the binding of ORF8 and surface glycoproteins to porphyrins to a certain extent 3 .",

Both drugs inhibit antigen presentation in dendritic cells, cytokine production in macrophages, and calcium, Toll-like receptor (TLR) and cGAS-STING signaling in B, T and other immune cells [55, 65] . The major proposed immunomodulatory mechanisms of CQ and HCQ are the following: inhibition of cytokine production and release by T cells: IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-18, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, reduced levels of chemokines, CCL2 and CXCL10, inhibition of micro-RNA expression, decreased TH17-related cytokines, increased in Treg activity and upregulated levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-2 and IL-10, inhibition of cytotoxic T cell and self-reactive CD4+ lymphocyte activities, decreased DNA, RNA and protein synthesis in thymocytes [55] .

IL-17 has wide-ranging proinflammatory effects on induction of cytokines; IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1; growth factors, G-CSF; chemokines; and matrix metalloproteinases. In a mouse model, it was found that H1N1 cause acute lung injury in an IL-17-dependent manner. It has been postulated that blocking this cytokine may be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 related organ damage [96] .",

Until an effective treatment is found, drugs that are used in daily rheumatology practice may constitute potential treatment options in COVID-19 patients not only by their antiinflammatory effects but also with some of their inherent antiviral properties.
