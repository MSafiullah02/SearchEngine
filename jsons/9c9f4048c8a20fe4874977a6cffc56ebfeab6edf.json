Sometimes these animals are referred to as an ageless species (more accurately, to species with negligibly small aging) [1 4] or considered an example of neoteny among mammals [5 8]. Studies on spontaneous and experimentally induced pathologic changes in the naked mole rat are among the most inter esting aspects of its biology, especially on the age related and neoplastic changes and on the possible causes of its natural mortality. Although in all these aspects there are still more questions than answers, some definite findings were obtained recently, and we think that a review of them would be useful as a jumping off place for further studies. We think that studies not only in pathologic anatomy of this unusual animal could be useful, but also in the fields where the naked mole rat is an important model animal in gerontology and biology of eusocial animals. According to the tradition adopted in pathology of laboratory ani mals, all lesions known in the naked mole rat will be sub divided into infectious and noninfectious pathologies. Problems of tumor growth, age related changes of organs and tissues, and causes of spontaneous death of this rodent will be considered separately.",

Therefore, the study of spontaneous and experimentally induced pathologies in these animals is one of the most impor tant tasks of gerontology. Various infections, noninfectious pathologies (including age dependent changes), and tumors have been described in the naked mole rat. The most frequent pathologies are traumas (bite wounds), purulent and septic com plications of traumatic injuries, renal tubular calcinosis, chronic progressive nephropathy, hepatic hemosiderosis, testicular interstitial cell hyperplasia, calcinosis cutis, cardiomyopathy, and dysbiosis related infectious lesions of the digestive system. However, the summarized data on pathology (including tumor incidence) and on the causes of mortality are insufficient. There are only few publications about the results of experiments where pathologies were induced in the naked mole rat. All these problems could be subjects for promising future studies without which adequate studies on mechanisms providing the long lifespan of the naked mole rat are impossible, as well as the elucidation of causes of tumor resistance of this species.",

In this connection, it seems interesting to mention here that infecting (by scarification of the extremity skin) with recombinant herpes simplex first type virus apathogenic for mice caused 100% death of naked mole rats [9] . They are also very sensitive to exper imental infection caused by Leishmania donovani [10] . BIOCHEMISTRY Hill et al. [11] found six cases of bilateral pneumonia in 25 spontaneously deceased animals in a colony of naked mole rats in their laboratory. The etiology of this pneumonia remained unknown. In the same colony, five animals died with a pathomorphological picture of sep ticemia accompanied by typhlitis and typhlocolitis (sometimes of hemorrhagic type); moreover, from the lungs and blood pneumococcus cultures were isolated, although pneumococcus is not a usual causative agent of spontaneous respiratory infections in laboratory rodents [12] . Moreover, in the animals with clinical signs of the disease (which ones is not specified in the work), bacteria from the groups Haemophilus and spirilla were found in the blood.",

Especially severe are puru lent lesions of the muzzle leading to its total necrosis, mutilation, and impossibility of food consumption by the animal.

They connected the etiology of these lesions with Balantidium and Trichomonas found in the large intestine. However, today these protozoa are thought to be components of the intes tinal contents of healthy animals [4] ; therefore, the etio logical role of these organisms needs to be proved (some times we observed Balantidium in the intestinal wall of naked mole rats, and this was always associated with signs of pronounced tissue autolysis, but inflammatory reaction was absent). Similar inflammatory epizootic like lesions were also described by other authors [4, 13] . In these cases, diarrhea was observed, as well as overfilling of all parts of the intestine with gas and liquid contents, hemor rhages, and areas with mucosal ulcers (with mixed leuko cytic infiltration, rare basophilic intranuclear inclusions in enterocytes, and hyperplasia of crypts), signs of intox ication, exicosis, and death of animals. However, the eti ology of these lesions was explained differently than in the work by Hill et al. [11] : based on all the cytological, his tological, and microbiological data (including tests on rotavirus, clostridial enterotoxin, and mycotoxin), it was hypothesized that these changes could be caused by intes tinal dysbiosis, but not by a single specific causative agent [4, 13] . However, the role of an agent with unknown bio logical (cultural) properties cannot be excluded [4] . A high lethality (44.1%) epizooty outburst was described of a disease accompanied by diarrhea, exicosis, and intestin al hemorrhages caused by coronavirus [14] . Males and the younger animals were more sensitive to this infection than females and old animals; the inbreeding degree also decreased the resistance to the coronavirus. Hill et al. [11] mentioned a case of stomach ulcer but did not discuss its etiology. Later ulcerative lesions of the stomach were described among the other changes during dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract [13] . Up to now, Helicobacter genus bacteria affecting many laboratory rodents have not been detected in the naked mole rats [4] .",

The initial reports published by zoologists stated that tumors were absent in 800 and even in 2000 dead bodies of the animals [2, 15] . These reports led to a steady conviction about the extraordinary resistance of the naked more rat to carcino genesis and even to attempts to find the reason for such resistance [16, 17] . This conviction was partially con firmed by results of the first pathological study of a signif icant series (138 animals) of naked mole rats [13] . However, it should be noted that animals that died of nat ural causes were only a part of this series (45 animals), whereas 93 animals were killed by euthanasia. The authors did not ascribe to tumors two cases of prolifera tive lesions with atypical cells but denoted them as pre neoplasias. One case presented a focal expansion of atyp ical cell structures in the kidney (a tubular papillary hyperplasia with atypia), and the other case presented limited alterations in the spleen characteristic for follicu lar lymphoma. The summarized incidence of such changes was 1.5%. However, the limitation of this work (besides the investigation was mainly of euthanized ani mals) is the absence of precise data on the age structure of the material studied. Since the risk of tumor development is clearly age dependent [18] , this is important for com paring with data on other animal species and on colonies of naked mole rats, as well as for answering the question about the incidence of spontaneous neoplasms in this species.",

            "text": "Comparison of these data with the results of studies on tumor incidence in other animals gives the following picture. Routine comparison of naked mole rats with inbred strains (BALB/c or C57BL/6) and hybrid labora tory mice (among which tumors were found at necropsy in 50 95% of the animals that died of natural causes [24 26] ) results in the conclusion about incomparably lower tumor incidence in the naked mole rats [15] . The same result is obtained if we compare the data on necropsy in naked mole rats with modern data on the risk of tumors in humans during their entire lives, which is \u223c40% [27] . However, it should be taken into consideration that com parison of the modern data on the incidence of clinically detected neoplasms in the human population with the results of necropsies in animals is somewhat incorrect, because in humans most tumors are revealed during their lifetimes, and many patients die without subsequent autopsy or are cured. Moreover, the latter circumstance makes possible appearance of another tumor, which sig nificantly influences the evaluation of the total oncologi cal risk [28, 29] . Unfortunately, modern data from autop sy are virtually absent from the literature, because patients who died from tumors are relatively seldom sub jected to autopsy. Therefore, it seems reasonable to com pare the incidence of neoplasms in the naked mole rat with the data obtained on wild animals and with the results of autopsy of patients obtained when there were no approaches for the efficient treatment and vital diagnosis of malignant tumors. Then the autopsy and histological examination were an obligatory procedure very similar to the algorithm used now for studies on tumor incidence in laboratory animals. According to results of such studies, the total incidence of tumor damaged animals in the adult population of wild mice (Mus musculus) having lived to natural death was 9.5% [30] , in the population of wild rats (Rattus norvegicus) it was 10% [31, 32] , and in Northern mole voles (Ellobius talpinus) it was 9% [33] . Autopsy results of cats and dogs give similar values [32] . As to humans, autopsy results fitting the above presented requirements give tumor incidence of 8% (Moscow, data of all autopsies made in hospitals during 1929 1932) [34] , or 8 10% of the total mortality in different countries dur ing the period from 1930 to 1960 [35] . Thus, it appears that the total incidence of tumors arising during the whole life is quite comparable (about 8 10%) in all the mentioned mammals. It is likely that in this case the situ ation is the same as with Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), which for a long time was thought resistant to carcino genesis [22, 31, 32] , although analysis of the literature revealed the absence of valid studies favoring this view point [36] .",

A comparative study on this problem can be per formed only in models of tumors induced by chemical or physical factors, which has not yet been done on the naked mole rat. Meanwhile, it is a priori unlikely to expect that the antitumor resistance of cells and tissues of the naked mole rat will be higher than such resistance of human cells and tissues, since the human lifespan (and hence the duration of the tumor free life period) is more than twofold longer and the body weight and total cellu larity (stochastically determining the risk of the mutant clone appearance [37, 38] ) are three orders higher than that of the naked mole rat.",

Unfortunately, the results published by now were obtained in very strange and unusual models, whereas classical methods of inducing tumors by chemical carcinogens or by ionizing radiation have not been reproduced on naked mole rats. Nevertheless, in some works the results obtained in such ersatz models are taken as reliable data. This may be exemplified by a publication [16] where data are discussed of a work [39] about the tumorigenic potential of induced pluripotent stem cells of the naked mole rat and mecha nisms of their resistance to tumorigenesis. However, in the original work [39] , the authors studied the ability of the naked mole rat's stem cells transplanted to nude mice to form teratomas. Having in mind that teratomas are benign lesions with a very specific position in oncology [35, 40] , it is obvious that these results have only an indirect con nection with studies on carcinogenesis in the naked mole rat. Another work declared as being the first study on the resistance of the naked mole rat's cells to experimental carcinogenesis [41] really contained only data that the naked mole rat's fibroblasts transfected with three genesvirus SV40 TAg antigen, oncogene Ras, and the gene of one of hTERT telomerase subunits -could grow after subcutaneous transplantation into immunodeficient mice. The key event needed by the naked mole rat's cells to acquire this ability was the transfection with the telom erase catalytic subunit gene that was not necessary for the cells of rats and mice. From the viewpoint of experimen tal oncology, this work is only a variant of the experiments by Seluanov et al. [42] on induction of the naked mole rat's immortalized cells, different only by the cultivation of these cells in immunodeficient mice instead of nutrient medium. The need to introduce the gene of the human catalytic telomerase into the naked mole rat's cells seems paradoxic, because in both mice and naked mole rats (as discriminated from humans) this enzyme retains high activity in somatic cells [37, 38] . In general, we think that none these works allow us even to speak about attempts of experimental reproduction in naked mole rats of real malignant tumors as has been for long the routine practice for many other laboratory rodents [32] .",

These works were summarized recently in a review [16] . It should be noted that any specific feature found in the naked mole rat in comparison with mouse, if it could have any (even a hypothetical) relation to tumori genesis, was automatically ascribed to mechanisms responsible for this animal's resistance to tumor growth. Such mechanisms are suspected to exist in genome fea tures, level of general metabolism, redox and protein homeostasis, cell resistance to stress, telomerase activity, and early contact inhibition. It is necessary to note that data about the unusual expression of contact inhibition [42] and the role in it of high molecular weight hyaluro nan [43] seem doubtful and in any case not universal. Such mechanism is unreal for so frequent tumors of rodents as lymphomas and leukemias, because their cells, unlike fibroblasts and epitheliocytes, can proliferate in the suspension state, and in this case contact inhibition cannot act as a regulatory mechanism preventing car cinogenesis.",

In this work, the morphology is described in detail and the incidence of individual CPN manifestations (different variants of lesions of glomeruli, interstitium, and tubular component of kidneys) is char acterized. However, the authors also ascribed to these manifestations kidney infarction and post infarction changes that are not usual components of CPN in labora tory rodents [20 23, 45] . It is interesting that in that work no cases were described of amyloidosis or nonamyloid glomerulopathy (although changes similar to membra BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 82 No. 12 2017 nous glomerulonephritis were observed and described also as CPN manifestations), which are not rare in labo ratory mice [21 23 ]. The primary role of the tubulo inter stitial component in the development of CPN in naked mole rats occurred to be much more pronounced than in rats and even in mice [46] . This can be significant because the primary role of the tubulo interstitial component is a necessary condition for realizing the scenario of the clon al-mutational pathogenesis of this disease [45] . It is also interesting that in the naked mole rat there are foci of pronounced renal hemopoiesis described earlier in an ecologically similar species, the Northern mole vole [33] . It is also worth attention that in some of the naked mole rats there were kidneys with the classic picture of terminal renal disease [46] usually leading to death [35, 40] .",

It is interesting to note that, as differentiated from short liv ing mice and rats, in the naked mole rat thymus there are true Hassall's bodies (resembling such bodies in humans), whereas the spleen of animals at the age of several years has signs specific for stress induced or the age related atrophy (our observation). Age related changes also include preneoplasias and true neoplasms, which are inevitably present in the naked mole rat [13, 15, 19] . The common age related pathology and the unusual for rodents long lifespan do not contradict each other, but such animals cannot be considered ageless (in any case, if we understand aging as stepwise accumulation of changes in tissues and associated decrease in physiological func tions). Nevertheless, to elucidate the cause of such anom alous lifespan remains a very real problem.
