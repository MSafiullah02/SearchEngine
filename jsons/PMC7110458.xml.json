An opaque cardboard screen was used to cover all parts of the lightbox that were not covered by the radiograph. Ambient light was limited, and room lights were dimmed with only one fluorescent bulb at some distance behind the camera kept on. Images were recorded as follows: TIFF image, black and white, resolution of 2048 \u00d7 1536 pixels (3.3 mega pixels), no flash, manual focus set to 1.0 meters, exposure value was set to +1.0, white balance and ISO set to auto, picture quality set to fine, and sharpness set to zero. The camera was mounted on a tripod with the height raised so that the camera was level with the center of the radiograph on the lightbox, and a string was used to ensure the length was one meter away from the lightbox surface. A minimal adjustment was made with the zoom in order to center and fill the camera viewfinder screen with the radiograph image.",

The digital images, camera and digitizer combined, were randomized and read; after a delay of two weeks, the 192 hard copies were read. A panel of board-certified radiologists in Bangkok reviewed the radiographs. Two primary radiologists reviewed all and a third reviewed images only when there were discrepancies between the results of the first two with respect to the key indicators of possible pneumonia, alveolar infiltrate, or interstitial infiltrate. The final interpretation was based on the first two readers, if in agreement, or on agreement between a primary reader and the third reader, if there were discrepancies between the first two readers. Each film was read independently and the reviewers were discouraged from re-reviewing images; reviewers were blinded to each other's readings. The only information available was age and sex of the patient, patient positioning if known, and a centimeter marker for film size. In addition, readers were aware that the images were from patients suspected of having pneumonia. Digital images were loaded onto a Vepro DICOM Archive and Viewing Station, Model ADAS-DVD, using MEDIMAGE software (Vepro GmbH, Pfungstadt Germany) and viewed on 19-inch cathode ray tube dual display monitors with dot pitch of 0.26 mm and maximum resolution of 1920 \u00d7 1440 pixels.

Overall image quality was categorized as adequate, suboptimal, and unreadable, modified from WHO guidelines. In addition, a modified version of a published checklist of quality criteria was used to look at specific image quality indicators.26 Images not allowing the minimum assessment of the central diagnosis of pneumonia were classified as unreadable. Images that allowed assessment of whether pneumonia was present or not, but not confident assessment of secondary endpoints (e.g., pneumothorax, atelectasis, etc.), were judged suboptimal. Images that permitted confident assessment of the absence or presence of pneumonia as well as other pathological findings were marked as adequate. Unreadable images were excluded from the analysis. Pneumonia was categorized into those with any alveolar consolidation, interstitial infiltrates only, and other evidence of pneumonia. To generate a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve, the radiologists were asked how clear the finding for pneumonia was on a 6-point scale: 1 = definitely pneumonia, 2 = probably pneumonia, 3 = possibly pneumonia, 4 = possibly not pneumonia, 5 = probably not pneumonia, 6 = definitely not pneumonia.",

Our study suggests that in the ability to detect pneumonia, the digital camera and film digitizer performed well compared to the hard copy, and were similar to each other. The ROC curve demonstrated a marginally superior ability to detect pneumonia with the film digitizer versus the digital camera, although the difference was not statistically significant. This finding likely reflects major improvements in digital camera technology. Furthermore, the cost of the digital camera set was one third that of the film digitizer. Overall, our data suggest that for the purposes of pneumonia surveillance in Thailand, use of a digital camera is a cost-effective and practical alternative to a film digitizer.",

Readers might be more likely to record the same result the second time they saw an image and thus bias the results to the null (i.e., no difference). In order to minimize the memory recall effect we randomized the digital images and had them read the original films last since they are perceived as being the highest quality. In addition, there were several weeks between the digital and hard copy readings.",

With advancing technology, cameras are becoming less expensive and able to take and store higher quality images for a fraction of the cost of film digitizers. This remains an area in which future developments could improve the way pneumonia surveillance is conducted.",
