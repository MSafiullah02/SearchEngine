This is a descriptive and retrospective study that used data collated on the World Health Organization (WHO) online platform between 21 January and 19 April 2020. After analyzing the data, it was observed that the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Brazil is lower than that in Italy. There are certain factors in Brazil which see it in a lower risk position than Italy; however, despite the current slow spread of the virus, the situation in Brazil is difficult to predict.",
