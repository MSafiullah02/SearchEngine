ZIKV infection mainly occurs after a bite by infected Aedes mosquitoes, through maternal\u2013fetal transmission, and less frequently by sexual transmission (Musso & Gubler, 2016; Petersen et al, 2016). The frequency of Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 syndrome is estimated to be 1/5,000 cases (Cao\u2010Lormeau et al, 2016; Lessler et al, 2016). Congenital malformations and adverse outcomes associated with ZIKV acquisition during pregnancy are likely due to placental infection and viral transmission to the fetus, with the virus displaying a tropism for neuronal cells (Garcez et al, 2016; Miner et al, 2016; Nowakowski et al, 2016; Quicke et al, 2016; Tang et al, 2016). However, ZIKV infection is generally asymptomatic or, in about 20% of the cases, associated with mild and non\u2010specific symptoms (Lessler et al, 2016; Petersen et al, 2016). The infection is thus self\u2010limiting in most cases. Mice lacking the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor or transcription factors implicated in interferon production develop neurological disease and succumb to ZIKV infection (Dowall et al, 2016; Lazear et al, 2016; Rossi et al, 2016). This suggests that the innate immune response controls viral spread and disease development (Xie et al, 2016), through mechanisms that are not clearly understood.",

            "text": "Zika virus is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which includes dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Despite differences in cell tropism and pathogenesis, flaviviruses employ similar replication strategies. The ZIKV RNA genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved post\u2010translationally into three structural proteins [capsid/core (C), premembrane (prM), and envelope (E)] and seven nonstructural proteins. In cell culture or animal models, ZIKV infects a variety of cell types, such as skin cells (dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes), epithelial cells, trophoblasts, neuronal cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Hamel et al, 2015; Garcez et al, 2016; Miner et al, 2016; Nowakowski et al, 2016; Quicke et al, 2016; Tabata et al, 2016; Tang et al, 2016). Several receptors, including DC\u2010SIGN, Axl, Tyro3, and TIM\u20101, promote ZIKV binding or entry into target cells, with a major role for the TAM receptors Axl and TIM\u20101 (Hamel et al, 2015; Tabata et al, 2016; Meertens et al, 2017). Flaviviral entry occurs through endocytosis and pH\u2010dependent fusion, while subsequent steps including synthesis of viral proteins, RNA replication, and particle assembly take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Bl\u00e1zquez et al, 2014; Ravindran et al, 2016). Flaviviruses rearrange ER membranes to build novel organelle\u2010like structures (also termed viral factories) used for viral production (Bl\u00e1zquez et al, 2014; Blanchard & Roingeard, 2015; Paul & Bartenschlager, 2015; Ravindran et al, 2016). Recent genetic CRISPR\u2010based screens identified that ER protein complexes involved in signal sequence recognition, N\u2010linked glycosylation, and ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD) are required for flavivirus replication (Marceau et al, 2016; Savidis et al, 2016a; Zhang et al, 2016). Membrane remodeling and accumulation of viral proteins trigger a stress pathway in the ER and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). This response induces ERAD (Bl\u00e1zquez et al, 2014). The UPR and autophagy pathways are intimately intertwined. Formation of autophagosomes in skin fibroblasts may facilitate ZIKV replication (Hamel et al, 2015), whereas autophagy assists DENV in part by regulating lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism (Heaton & Randall, 2010).",

            "text": "In addition to serving as the site for virus replication and production, the ER is central to the cytopathic effects observed in flavivirus\u2010infected cells. The ERAD pathway and the ER membrane complex (EMC) are primary drivers of WNV\u2010induced cell death (Ma et al, 2015). Cell death resulting from flavivirus infection may occur via different mechanisms, with apoptosis being an important pathway, as demonstrated with WNV\u2010, JEV\u2010, ZIKV\u2010, and DENV\u2010infected cells (Ghosh Roy et al, 2014; Frumence et al, 2016). Other reported mechanisms of flavivirus\u2010induced cell death include necrosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis (Ghosh Roy et al, 2014; Danthi, 2015; Frumence et al, 2016; Suwanmanee & Luplertlop, 2016). How the UPR and cell death are linked in ZIKV infection is unknown. Furthermore, the relative contribution of various cell death pathways to ZIKV\u2010induced cytopathy has not been explored.",

They block the entry of diverse viruses by inhibiting virus\u2013cell fusion (Brass et al, 2009; Everitt et al, 2012; Diamond & Farzan, 2013; Smith et al, 2014). The mechanisms involved include altering the biophysical properties or cholesterol content of the cellular membranes in which they are found (Amini\u2010Bavil\u2010Olyaee et al, 2013; Li et al, 2013; Desai et al, 2014). These proteins inhibit many enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), the flaviviruses WNV and DENV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus (Brass et al, 2009; Zhu et al, 2015; Gorman et al, 2016) as well as HIV\u20101 and SIV (Lu et al, 2011). We and others identified new antiviral functions of IFITM proteins during HIV\u20101 infection: IFITM3 in the virus\u2010producing cell is incorporated into nascent virions and decreases virus\u2013cell fusion (Compton et al, 2014; Tartour et al, 2014; Yu et al, 2015).",

Here we confirm and extend these initial observations using transformed and primary human cells. We show that IFITM3 is an important component of the type\u2010I interferon response conferring protection against ZIKV infection. Combining time\u2010lapse microscopy, electron microscopy, and other techniques, we describe in detail the fate of ZIKV\u2010infected cells. We report a striking succession of events including cytoplasmic vacuole formation, cell shrinkage, and \u201cimplosion\u201d, which is exacerbated when levels of IFITM3 are low. We further demonstrate that the large vacuoles are derived from the ER, require the Sec61 translocon for their formation, and are associated with paraptosis\u2010like cell death of ZIKV\u2010infected cells. These findings reinforce the crucial importance of intrinsic virus restriction, mediated largely by IFITM proteins, in the control of ZIKV infection and avoidance of cytopathy. Furthermore, these findings provide functional insight into the mechanisms driving cell death during ZIKV infection, which likely contribute to ZIKV\u2010associated disease in vivo.",

In control cells, the virus establishes a productive infection and spreads rapidly, as scored by the appearance of cells expressing viral envelope (E) protein (stained with the pan\u2010flavivirus anti\u2010E antibody 4G2) (Fig EV1B). IFITM3 severely impaired productive ZIKV infection, whereas IFITM1 and IFITM2 exerted a lower antiviral effect (Fig EV1B and C). IFITM3 is primarily localized in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. To determine whether the location of IFITM3 is important for the restriction, we used 293T cells expressing a variant of IFITM3 lacking the amino\u2010terminus (IFITM3 \u22061\u201021), which accumulates at the cell surface (Chesarino et al, 2014; Jia et al, 2014; Compton et al, 2016). IFITM3 \u22061\u201021 restricted ZIKV replication less efficiently than the full\u2010length protein (Fig EV1C). Murine IFITM3 also potently inhibited ZIKV replication (Fig EV1C). Two other ZIKV strains, isolated from individuals from French Polynesia and New Caledonia (PF13 and NC14, respectively; Hamel et al, 2015; Barba\u2010Spaeth et al, 2016; Chouin\u2010Carneiro et al, 2016), exhibited a similar sensitivity to IFITM3 (Fig EV1D). In human newborn foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and adult dermal fibroblasts (HDFa), which both display relatively low levels of basal IFITM3, transduction with a lentivector resulted in about 60\u201380% of the cells expressing IFITM3 (Fig EV1E). ZIKV infection was reduced by fourfold to fivefold in these cells, with 4G2+ cells appearing predominantly in the IFITM3\u2010low population (Fig EV1E).",

Protein levels of IFITM3 were reduced by > 80%, in the presence or absence of IFN, when compared to control cells treated with a scrambled shRNA (sh\u2010SCR; Fig 1A). Knockdown of IFITM3 led to a 10\u2010fold enhancement of ZIKV infection, whereas pre\u2010treatment of control HeLa cells with IFN strongly inhibited infection (Fig 1B). However, IFN exerted only a modest antiviral effect in sh\u2010IFITM3 cells when compared to sh\u2010SCR cells (Fig 1B), demonstrating that IFITM3 is a major contributor to the anti\u2010ZIKV response mediated by IFN (Hamel et al, 2015; Bayer et al, 2016; Lazear et al, 2016). Silencing of IFITM3 via siRNA in HDFa cells (Fig EV2A) also resulted in enhanced sensitivity to ZIKV, confirming an antiviral role for endogenous IFITM3 in primary cells.",

However, a detailed and mechanistic description of these events has not been performed for ZIKV. Using HeLa cells in which IFITM3 was silenced or not, we visualized cells using time\u2010lapse fluorescence microscopy following incubation with virus, with images acquired every 10 min for up to 96 h. The cells also expressed GFP to facilitate visualization. The addition of propidium iodide (PI), a membrane\u2010impermeable dye which stains cellular DNA, allowed us to monitor the terminal death event. Representative examples are shown in Fig 1C and Movies EV1, EV2 and EV3. ZIKV (HD78 strain) induces a mild cytopathic effect in control cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, driving the appearance of few PI+ cells and allowing for ongoing cell proliferation (Fig 1D and Movies EV1 and EV3). In the absence of IFITM3, however, PI+ labeling occurred in virtually all cells. A visual scoring of cells showed that 15% of IFITM3\u2010positive cells and > 95% of IFITM3\u2010silenced cells die at 72 h pi, respectively (Fig 1E). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that death of ZIKV\u2010infected cells is preceded by the formation of massive cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig 1C) and cytoplasmic contraction typically occurred 2\u20135 h post\u2010vacuolization (see a quantification of the duration of events in Fig EV3A). Approximately 6 h later, membrane integrity was lost and death was confirmed by PI staining. This final phase is characterized by bubble\u2010like membrane extensions and an \u201cimplosive\u201d destruction of the cell (Movies EV1, EV2 and EV3). Similar cell death phenomena can also be observed in control HeLa cells, albeit to a lower frequency (Fig 1D and E, and Movies EV1, EV2 and EV3). Single\u2010cell analysis showed that, once initiated, vacuolization and death proceeded similarly in both IFITM3\u2212 and IFITM3+ cells (Fig EV3A). A similar cytopathic effect was observed in cells infected with ZIKV strains NC14 and PF13 (not shown). Of note, exposure of HeLa sh\u2010IFITM3 cells to dengue virus DENV2 16681 strain, derived from a dengue hemorrhagic fever patient (Medina et al, 2015), led to productive infection without massive vacuolization of cells (Fig EV4).",

All cells displaying vacuolization were positive for E protein, indicating that this process is associated with productive infection. Close examination at a higher magnification revealed that E protein is predominantly found in a dense perinuclear region, and to a lesser extent, at the limiting edges and lumens of the large vacuoles (Fig 3B). In the presence of IFITM3, HeLa cells exhibiting large vacuoles were much less frequent, but when present, they displayed a pattern of E protein staining similar to cells in which IFITM3 is silenced (Fig EV3B).

This region resembles the \u201cmembranous web\u201d induced by DENV infection and likely corresponds to viral factories, the primary sites of viral production (Bl\u00e1zquez et al, 2014; Blanchard & Roingeard, 2015; Paul & Bartenschlager, 2015; Ravindran et al, 2016).

Mycolactone is a diffusible macrolide that blocks the biogenesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins by inhibiting the Sec61 translocon, the channel guiding nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen (Hall et al, 2014; Guenin\u2010Mace et al, 2015; Kalies & Romisch, 2015; Baron et al, 2016; McKenna et al, 2016; Ravindran et al, 2016). Recent screen\u2010based studies revealed that Sec61 is required for DENV and ZIKV replication (Heaton et al, 2016; Marceau et al, 2016; Zhang et al, 2016). In accordance with these findings, cells treated with mycolactone at 2 h following ZIKV exposure were completely refractory to infection and vacuolization (Fig 5C), while partial inhibition occurred when mycolactone was added at later time points (Fig EV5A). Mycolactone directly targets the \u03b1 subunit of the Sec61 translocon (Baron et al, 2016), so we used cells expressing a mutant Sec61\u03b1 resistant to the effects of mycolactone (Sec61 mut) (Baron et al, 2016). ZIKV infection was not inhibited by mycolactone in cells expressing mutant Sec61 (Fig EV5B), implying that Sec61 blockade protects against ZIKV infection. Of note, Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, also inhibited ZIKV infection (Fig EV5A). Together, these results indicate that viral production requires Sec61 activity. Moreover, when viral protein synthesis is blocked by mycolactone, no vacuolization is observed.",

While flavivirus infection is often associated with apoptosis, one of the most characterized mechanisms of programmed cell death, other possibilities exist. Our attention was drawn to \u201cparaptosis\u201d, a form of cell death characterized by swelling of the ER and mitochondria as well as cytoplasmic vacuolization (Sperandio et al, 2000, 2004; Ranjan & Iwakumazr, 2016). Paraptosis is naturally observed during development and neurodegeneration and can be induced by expression of insulin\u2010like growth factor I receptor (IGF\u2010IR; Sperandio et al, 2000, 2004; Ranjan & Iwakumazr, 2016). Furthermore, paraptosis can be triggered in cancer cells through treatment with various anti\u2010tumor agents or cyclosporin A (CsA; Ram & Ramakrishna, 2014; Lee et al, 2016). These studies have indicated that paraptosis is dependent on the activation of phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) and MAP kinases (Sperandio et al, 2004; Ram & Ramakrishna, 2014).",

To better understand the cellular pathways important for virus\u2010induced vacuole formation and cell death, we examined the effects of various kinase inhibitors. HeLa cells were treated with inhibitors 2 h following ZIKV exposure to rule out any effect on virus attachment and entry (Fig 6B). Two pan\u2010PI3K inhibitors, 3MA and wortmannin, the latter being reported to block paraptotic vacuoles (Ram & Ramakrishna, 2014), efficiently blocked vacuole formation following ZIKV infection. However, 3MA and wortmannin block both class\u20101 and class\u20103 PI3K (also known as Vps34), and the latter class has a well\u2010described role in autophagosome formation during the process of autophagy. Therefore, we tested other inhibitors exhibiting greater specificity: the class\u20101\u2010specific PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 (Kong & Yamori, 2007), the class\u20103\u2010specific PI3K inhibitor SAR405 (Ronan et al, 2014), and the Akt\u2010specific inhibitor Triciribine (Akt V) (Yang et al, 2004). None of these inhibitors blocked ZIKV infection (Fig 6B). However, our results strongly suggest that the class\u20101 PI3K/Akt signaling axis is involved in cytopathic vacuole formation in ZIKV\u2010infected cells (Fig 6C). In contrast, while inhibition of class\u20103 PI3K diminished clustering of the autophagosome marker LC3 (Fig EV6A), it had no effect on vacuole formation in ZIKV\u2010infected cells (Fig 6C). Comparable levels of infection and vacuole formation are observed in cells in which LC3 is silenced, further excluding a role for autophagosomes in ZIKV\u2010induced cytopathy (Fig EV6B).",

Genetic screens recently identified components of the ER as being required for flavivirus replication and cell death (Ma et al, 2015; Heaton et al, 2016; Marceau et al, 2016; Zhang et al, 2016). We also show that the Sec61 blocker mycolactone abrogates ZIKV replication, the formation of intracellular vacuoles, and cell death, indicating that events taking place in the ER drive this destructive pathway. Since ER membranes serve as scaffolds for viral protein synthesis and virion assembly (Paul & Bartenschlager, 2015; Ravindran et al, 2016), it is possible that the giant, ER\u2010derived vacuoles facilitate ZIKV production. While we did not observe large quantities of virus\u2010like particles inside the vacuoles, we show that ZIKV RNA and E protein concentrate at their borders, raising the possibility that they are important for an intermediate step of virus replication.

The virus\u2010induced structures highlighted here are highly reminiscent of those generated during so\u2010called paraptosis, a non\u2010apoptotic form of cell death (Sperandio et al, 2000, 2004; Ram & Ramakrishna, 2014; Lee et al, 2016; Ranjan & Iwakumazr, 2016).

Here we extend these findings by showing that ZIKV\u2010induced paraptosis\u2010like death requires class 1 but not class 3 PI3K activity, implicating an involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway and ruling out a major role for autophagy. Using models of mice susceptible to ZIKV infection (Lazear et al, 2016), administration of class\u2010I PI3K inhibitors will help determine whether paraptosis\u2010like cytopathy is responsible for morbidity in vivo. Interestingly, we observe that caspase\u20103 activation is detected among cells exposed to ZIKV. However, inhibition of caspase activity does not prevent cell death, strongly suggesting that apoptosis is not the major driving force for the cytopathic effects observed in ZIKV\u2010infected cells.

Furthermore, they are not loaded with neutral lipids, excluding their role as lipid droplets observed in some DENV\u2010 or HCV\u2010infected cells (Paul & Bartenschlager, 2015). Nonetheless, future work will shed light on how genuine autophagy may impact paraptosis and if these processes are cooperative or antagonistic.",

            "text": "While the cytopathic events described here were detectable in cells containing IFITM3, these phenomena were much more apparent upon IFITM3 silencing. This suggests that once incoming ZIKV virions have surmounted the intracellular barrier mediated by IFITM3, a pathway leading to ER stress and cell death is triggered. As such, the proportion of dying cells following exposure to ZIKV was much lower when IFITM3 was present. Thus, our results suggest that IFITM3 is a major component of host innate control of ZIKV and is likely implicated in the low pathogenicity observed in most infected individuals (Lessler et al, 2016). IFITM3 is required to prevent pathogenesis of IAV or WNV infections in mice (Everitt et al, 2012; Gorman et al, 2016). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12252\u2010C) in human IFITM3 is predicted to produce a truncated form of IFITM3, which is confined to the plasma membrane (Everitt et al, 2012). Since this polymorphism may be associated with severe outcomes following IAV infection (Everitt et al, 2012; Zhang et al, 2013), it will be worth examining whether the severity of ZIKV infection is associated with polymorphisms in IFITM genes.",
